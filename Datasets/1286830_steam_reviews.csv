I will be dividing my review in different sections and give my final thoughts afterwards for a general idea about how I feel/felt about this game in particular. As a fan of the KotOR series, I was interested in the release of SWTOR, even though at my age I didn't know much about MMMORPG's in general. However, I've always wanted to know more about the events after the 2nd installment, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II, so I decided to give this game a go. Little did I know, that I would be spending most of my college and work years on this game!

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
This is always one of the most important aspects of an MMO. The game has a good amount of classes, 16 in total as of this review with 8 being mirror classes. PvP is a lot of fun, but it's really hard to get into it until you're atleast fully geared for endgame. I will talk more about PvP later. Here you will find a pro/con list of what I have noticed about the gameplay since 2011:

Pros:
[list]
    [*] 8 classes to play + their mirror classes (Republic/Empire).
    [*] Since the release of Origin stories in LoTS, you can now have two different classes per character. Which is separated by Force user or non-Force user. This allows you to play 6 different styles, as one class has three different disciplines.
    [*] Jumping puzzles add extra content on top of just combat and crafting.
    [*] The new ability tree gives you options to play your discipline differently. Though this can also slightly be a con due to there always being a meta for it, whether single-target focused options or AOE.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*] If you enjoy fashion and gameplay combined. Then you will have issues with this game already. 95% of capes, due to their physics, will be stuck to the front of your character during cutscenes or by using animation that drastically change the position of your character. Most notably AOE abilities and jumping attacks.
    [*] Due to the old engine, the game will most likely have lag-spike issues and low framerate when doing PvP in endgame (lots of flashy abilities) and Operations (raids). A  way to minimize the issue is by having Nameplate for Friendlies off or unchecking the Scaling option for Nameplates. I am obviously not going into graphics, that will be further explained in the graphics section.
    [*] Questing can and most likely will feel tedious due to the massive zones in each planet. If F2P, it will take you quite some time to use a vehicle at a decent amount of speed. Even then, it will still feel tedious as the game works a lot with Quest A>Quest B>Quest A. If you like travelling and enjoying the landscape, then you will tolerate it for the most part. Having to travel to the same zone in every planet 8 times will feel tedious though. The planets that mostly have these issues are Balmorra, Hoth & Belsavis.
    [*] Flashpoints (dungeons) are hard to get into as newbies due to the years of content veterans had to go through. I am always open to have new players in the party for Veteran Dungeons. However, most people expect you to know every shortcut possible, and to skip every conversation option when prompted. I would argue to play it in STORY mode first and then dive in with other people!
[/list]

[h1] CONTENT [/h1]
I usually don't add this section in reviews, but I feel it's a must for MMO's with subscription services. Content and updates are very important for both the developers to add longevity to the game, and the player who wants to play what he's paying for.
The game currently has a couple of gamemodes that I will divide into PVE & PVP sections. Here is the list and my thoughts on it:

[b]PVE[/b]
Lots of content worth for new players! 30+ dungeons that are separated into STORY, VETERAN & MASTER*. A moderate amount of Raids with three difficult options. Uprisings & Star Fortresses that are known as small scale dungeons. Space battles split into Space Battle & Galactic Starfighter. Jumping puzzles for Datacrons. Tons of dailies and 2 events a month! There are a lot of hours worth of playing just for the PvE. Add the 8 Vanilla storylines and every expansion included you will most likely busy yourself for a stupid amount of hours (I know I did!).

[b]PVP[/b]
I am a little bit biased on PvP in general, because it's the main thing I play in games (Especially mmo's). Currently ranked has been removed and the game is split between 4v4 Arena's & 8v8 objective-based modes. They have also added a new reward tracking system for both these modes.
I both love and hate PvP in SWTOR. I love it because of the high adrenaline you get when fighting for points, having 1v1 moments mid 8v8 match, pushing enemy players off the map, scoring points, dealing a ton of damage, tactfully play matches with friends, etc. The game is fast-paced and you will always find yourself busy (even when defending). It's a small community, so if you play it often you will most likely match with the same people every now and then, gain friends & rivalries. It can be a lot of fun!
I hate PvP because it doesn't encourage people to play, only to participate. The game already performs really bad in 8v8s, classes are unbalanced and very often you will find yourself having an afk player, waiting for the match to end. Queues take too long. Everything outside level 80 PvP is near impossible to enjoy due to the level gap. You won't be able to do much if you queue with a Level 10 and fight someone with Level 38. Your stats will be bolstered, but you miss out on CC breakers, DCDs, DPS abilities that are crucial to your discipline's rotation, etc.
Unnecessary amount of information at the end of the match, not enough medals rewarded for your contribution, confusing system when tracking your pvp rewards. Players suffer from ridiculous new achievements as well as progress reset on every character. Progression is not based on character but on Discipline. If you won 1 game on an Immortal Juggernaut, it will show up as 0 games won if you switch to a Rage Juggernaut.
Galactic Starfighter, which is another PvP mode, has not been updated for years. There will likely not be any new content for it.

The current version of PvP simply has too many issues and I cannot recommend playing it for only this.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
For an old MMO, the graphics still hold pretty well. Newer armor sets and weapons have a lot of details. This also applies for new added planets since the launch of KOTFE.

[h1]SOUND DESIGN[/h1]
The soundtrack is amazing. Some tracks not released in the OST are also great! Especially ambient tracks in Balmorra, Alderaan & Republic Fleet. Sound designs for lightsabers and blasters are great and it will immerse you in the Star Wars world. The only negative point I can think of is that some lightsaber sound effects are delayed!

[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]
I have been playing since release. Taking breaks every now and then. I genuinely recommend people to play this for the 8 story lines, as well as the fun PvE content atleast once. The game however suffers from a low amount of effort/content added every year. The moment you finish everything in the game, you will have to wait 2 years for content worth a month's subscription. An enormous amount of bug issues. Pets not spawning back after instances, capes glitching and newer gear in general. unnecessary amount of currencies for endgame, confusing new systems, patches with more bugs than content every month or so. There are simply too many issues right now and I cannot recommend it for its current state!

Are you F2P/Returning: [b]Recommended[/b], 1 month subscription and you will finish all content. The money will be worth your time!
Current players: [b]Not Recommended[/b]. I'd even argue to unsubscribe.

When I played this years ago, you could play the free version and still open tickets. You also weren't immediately bombarded with 30 dozen ads whenever you open the game. It's made it very unpleasant to play when I'm constantly getting notifications for things I could maybe have if I got ANOTHER subscription. The game Mods only give a shit if you're giving them money, which I am, but somehow there's a disconnect between Steam and SWTOR where I have no idea where the hell my money is going and there's also nothing on Steam to let me cancel my subscription. Because I don't want to pay for something I can't use. It's asinine.

The class storylines are honestly amazing and make for an incredibly fun leveling experience that isn't tiring or grindy. Storylines in later expansions as well are just masterpieces. Knights of the Fallen Empire and Knights of the Eternal Throne especially are in my opinion some of the best storylines in all of Star Wars. The endgame raids may not be on as grand a scale as WoW, but most have very interesting mechanics and are very fun. My favorite is Terror From Beyond. PvP in Swtor is honestly amazing. I don't care for PvP in WoW, but I love the PvP in Swtor. The Battlegrounds are so ingenious, Huttball and Voidstar are super fun. And there's no Pay to Win. Everything that can be bought with real money are only cosmetic, and while an argument can be made that it breaks immersion when you can start off at level 1 with a top tier armor set and lightsaber, I honestly like that as a veteran player.

If a Star Wars fan is looking for a story, this is a free steal. Levelling is still quite meaty, so if you want a better experience, take a subscription to get all the goodies and a smoother ride. In 2022 the game is slightly different, I would say better as it has had some time to fit into the free to play model which didn't originally work. It didn't originally work because it felt like it denied you the game as 'free to play', now the subscription seems to add more to mechanics.

Whatever you do, if you are thinking about subbing, and you played previously, make sure you don't use Steam to buy the DLC subscription pack.

Like, the game is somewhat fun, but make no mistake: they will nickel and dime and shove in your face every five to ten minutes that you need to give them MORE and you're somehow a freeloader even if you subscribe.

I started playing this game way back in 2011, have watched the product closely since those days. Played off and on for several years and seen it grow. I don't believe the game is perfect nor will I try to argue that. Bottom line is, if you enjoy Star Wars you will likely enjoy this. Die-hard fans will pick somethings apart nitpicking. As an MMO, its decent and the polish while not absolute is there.

So lets start with the stuff you came for, the good, the bad and the ugly. 

The Good:

The game's classes each have a decent story, some better then others.  But they all are fairly well played out and will give you several hours of Star Wars goodness, like your own personal sitcom of a tv show. 

The companions and romance options for the most part are engaging and when you get further along, more come along to offer more options.  Along with new companions that each have backstories and sometimes interesting stories to tell. Many people will swear by Lana Beniko as best girl. But its up to you to decide for yourself which guy or gal is your favorite.  Eventually you can have any companion as they went further away from class being divided for story. 

The graphics are a unique style that doesn't copy any of the other present MMOs, some may like that or dislike that. I personally find it charming and a fun part of the game.  

The combat feels nice and is fun whatever you plan to do, not to mention the community is on the friendlier side.  So asking for help will normally net you some, for build or stuff. Not saying people are going to just hand you credits. But it is a friendly community compared to other MMOs. 

Active updates and storylines are put out for this game fairly regularly, given its been going since 2011, that's a pretty good perk.

The Bad: 

This game has a very very rough start and feels tiring from 1-50 storyline wise. It used a lot of tactics that I think weren't fair. If you are a subscriber you do benefit highly. But in the end it does feel very drawn out for some classes.


The Ugly: I was torn on where to put this, but the way this game is ""Free to Play"" Is down right predatory in some degrees. The number of Flash points you can do used to be limited, you were unable to join operations/raids.  The exp was cut in half for players not subscribed as well, also the time you get your mount/speeder is also longer. Just a ton of things that rub me wrong about this.  I still play and maybe if this review gets attention they may change things. But I won't hold my breath given the company who owns it. 

For now this is all I think I want to talk about, I'll keep gearing and stuff like that divided maybe on youtube or something else. But if anyone thinks of something I missed for any category, please post a comment so we can educate and make aware.

With That being said:
Star Wars: Old Republic MMO is a Great Game! Graphics are dated. (soon to be updated with 7.0 patch) But Content is very flushed out and keeps you engaged.

There's a ton of story content, a variety of missions, a slew of crafting options, a wast selection of mounts, pets, and gear, and a lot of choices that matter in this game. You also have the ability to own and customise bases/strongholds.  The best part is that, you can play this for free and subscribe as you wish. I totally recommend this game to every sci-fi fan out there.

Speaking of subscriptions, I personally feel that it is better to buy it from the swtor website instead of steam. I had some issues activating my subscription after purchasing a 180 day recurring subscription DLC via steam (it didn't activate for me after charging me), and it looked like steam support had little control over it (Now, I don't blame the steam agents as sync issues and bugs can sometimes happen with any tech, but it would be better if they had a way to escalate such issues to the swtor team directly, but they don't). Thankfully, I reached out to swtor support team directly by email along with my proof of purchase (i.e., unedited full screen screenshots of purchase history and the purchase receipt on steam), and the swtor team got my account up and running within 24 hours.

The only redeemable thing about this game is the interactive Story and good writing. But unless you want to pay monthly to prevent hours of grinding just to get to the next dialogue box, your time can probably be spent more effectively playing any other game.

Not to mention that there are still a bunch of performance bugs that will sometimes even prevent you from selecting a character and starting the game entirely. Good luck repairing or even reinstalling this 50GB game everytime it wants to remind you which company coded it.

Like that you can go as deep as you want into various activities or not.  It's awesome that there's no addon reliance but they addressed quality of life stuff so that the usual grind for gear is not as bad.  Standard high level gear drops will be good enough unless you are really wanting to do 8 or 16 man groups and the hardest modes of each then you will need to chase the monkey some but if find a guild that's active in those areas it's not too bad. But it's the Star Wars universe yes it's 3000 years before the movies but you are walking/running thru the same places  as your movie characters just at a different time.  Lots of story telling, lots of content, lots of exploration. Very much an MMO that can keep you occupied for some time.  The lack of social / guild finding in game is sort of sad I mean you literally have to go old school and go into forums of different sites and looks for posts from guilds looking for players.  There are general chat posts of guilds looking but from a quality of life perspective it could be better.  You can have your own stronghold, guild stronghold, guild ship stronghold, multiple properties and such so lots to do there.  Haven't touched crafting but seems to be a credit sink except for those folks that began from the beginning.  The economy is a little wonky for the prices not sure why that is but you get plenty of drops to sell and such.  Companions and pets are here also.  So it's like most MMO's in general but again I say ""OMG it's Star Wars!!!!"" that makes it worth it right there.  They have truly made an MMO that allows a player to decide how deep or what type of experience do you want and it's not tied to the great rat race of chasing raids to get gear.  If you want to do the hardest stuff then you will go down that path but most of the game does not require that kind of requirement. I've played WoW , ESO , Neverwinter and several others they all have their place.  SWTOR seems to have found several avenues for fans of Star Wars to enjoy their adventure at their pace.

Now I'll say the things i like and then dislike. First off its got a very submersive universe and feels nice to get the story from such a long time ago in the star wars universe i do like that about it and i do like all the customization you can do with everything. Now for the bad... So lets start with this its an EA game so that means its pay to win and basically if you want to do something as simple as sprinting(along with may other things such as loot rewards and character types) you need a subscription and how much is a subscription $14.99 a month. Its very expensive and personally i don't care how good the game is i don't have that much money a month to dedicate to a game like this i mean i have bills to pay i don't live with my parents. which brings me to the next thing that i actually hate about this game and its the way the character controls work. So everything works with the normal w,a,s,d, and mouse controls except they are overly complicated. the a and d key just turn your character like their stuck to an axis the character doesn't strafe in that direction they just turn and this wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for the fact that i have to hold down right click on an overly sensitive mouse to move my head around and then if i want to attack an enemy or select anything i have to stop using right click move the mouse to what you want to interact with and then just left click. to me these controls are over complicated and annoying. but that's just a personal preference and i did get use to it after a while of playing i just wish there was a smoother way to control your character because as of now the game feels very choppy in that regard and not worth a subscription of any amount. Which brings me to my summery the game itself is really good for this kind of rpg its got a good story which feels very star wars and i like that a lot however because its an EA game if you really want to experience the game fully you need to pay them for everything and the controls are over complicated and that's why id say if you're not an avid star wars fan or you don't have to much experience with these kind of game id avoid this one and i wouldn't give EA anymore money. In fact i'd say even if you play it don't give EA anymore money they don't need it and its not worth it anyway.",1607566807,1607566807,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Now whether it is called for or not most who purchase this game are going to immediately start comparing each and every detail to World of Warcraft.  There is no way around that so I will just touch on a few things to save you the time.   It is a well put together game with the only true issues being ""quality of life"" annoyances except for one.  For this reason I will not bother with a list of positives and will just pick out the problems that I caught.

-Bioware was involved so this has more true RPG elements to it than something like World of Warcraft.  This means hidden items and chests which equals no flying mounts.  Do not look for the ones that fly as none do as if they did this RPG element would be a waste of time.

-Animations are not as crisp as they could be, especially the final blow to an enemy.  It will frequently give you flashbacks of Johnny Cage in the Mortal Kombat movie saying ""this is where you fall down.""

-Violates one of the video game ten commandments by utilizing platforming in a non platformer game.  I would normally call this a big problem but you only utilize it for optional reasons but make no mistake it does not handle like a platformer and if you want optional things you will be platforming on very thin bars and guess work jumps.  

-Padding.  RPGs are known for padding but not like this.  The amount in this game is astonishing.  

-Not as many players as you may be used to.  Does not affect me as I do not group up or join guilds but it was noticeable when you are used to the auction houses in World of Warcraft having everything plus some.  Old Republics is fairly sparse.  

-The crafting system is completely flawed.  You have a limit, yes even as a premium subscriber and for some unfathomable reason your team all have to have the same exact ones and progress on leveling your crafting, which tops out at 600 right now in this game, is not saved if you switch it out.  Maybe it does when you max it but I do not know.  

-Now the big issue.  The limiter cap.  Yes my friends an RPG with a level limiter system.  Now before I continue I want to preface this by saying I do understand why they put it in.  I get it and I am not complaining about difficulty so in case A Dark Souls fan boy reads this and spills his Code Red all over his Git Gud tattoo in anger, the difficulty is not the problem.  They put it in so you can not grind level a character to make the trip easier and so you are more inclined to socialize with others and team up.  So do not go thinking that you can grind out twenty levels on your first world and be solid as the game will let you level up but it will keep your stats fixed at level ten on world one, like seventeen or so on two, twenty five on three, and so on.  My problem is that not only is grinding part of the legacy of an RPG it defeats the point.  RPGs are about you playing the game how you want.  Hey you don't want to talk to the Jarl of Whiterun and you want to go straight to the Dark Brotherhood at level one? Go for it.  This would have never been an issue if they put in an option to turn it off and on.....before you google it, no they did not.  It is anathema to an RPG to strip choice from the player.
Last thing I will say is watch your bundling if you buy it here on Steam.  Steam offers no support for this game in any way and you will just be sent to EA or Bioware.  They are so backed up with complaints right now from players who are missing things they paid for on Steam that there is an almost week long wait on response emails.  I myself have been sending screenshots to EA as all my DLC was there but the 5500 coins...you know the most expensive thing on that menu were never given to me.  Be careful.

Graphics are somewhat dated but overall character progression and story lines are well done. The individual character class stories are iconic and if you go through them all, you will see how different points within the stories that compliment each other over time. 

Combat is typical MMO style, tab target, go through rotations of abilities and then rinse and repeat. PvP tends to have imbalances that are typical within MMORPGs in general but still enjoyable when you are teamed up with friends and Guild mates. 

Player housing is available...but somewhat lack luster in variety and agility of object placement. All objects are placed by hooks and have finite distances they can be manipulated. 

Cartel market you can buy cartel coins and receive 500 coins per month if you are a subscriber. Items in the market are all cosmetic in nature, so it isnt game breaking or pay to win concepts. 

I have met and made many close friends while playing this game. Sometimes the open chat can be a little irritating, but you can mute or ignore people that are rude. Most players have been helpful over the years in answering questions and there are still Youtubers out there that regularly publish updates and How To guides for beginners. 

For a game that is starting to age, I still find it very enjoyable and will probably stick around as a subscriber til the servers go dark. Not a total fan boy, but for me, this is an enjoyable pastime in the MMO genre.",1603234154,1603234154,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review below, while still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age"".

Star Wars: The Old Republic is now nine years old at the time of this publication. The game has an incredible amount of content to offer to a new player. The learning curve is not too steep and the stories are all free to enjoy them at your own pace.

All the way up to level 60 is currently available 100% free of charge. You can play all 8 origin class stories to level 50, and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60.

If you enjoy playing casually, you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account. However, once you approach the EndGame, you start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard. Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriber, you may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expires.

SWTOR offers tons of solo content, but it shines in the group play, especially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available. Be it casual or hardcore, raiding, PvPing, exploration, Conquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game. Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into them, then join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grind.

Being a nine years old game, SWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game. I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single  update, change, bright moments and failures over the years. It's a thing to consider, but if you are reading this review, you are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game. Yes, absolutely.

The game engine is a giant issue from the very beginning. Low FPS in group environment such as Operations and Warzones may be frequent and the graphics of the game in the old content really shows how long it's been since SWTOR's release. BioWare is dedicated to updating the old content slowly from time to time.

Enjoy your own Star Wars Saga with fully voiced over cinematic story experience and personal choices that some times lead to real consequences down the line.",1595437597,1595481458,True,915,16,0.963529706001281738,41,True,False,False

Behind the pay wall there is 5 expansions(one month sub unlocks all 5 expansions and raise lvl cap from 50 to 75 at the cost of $14), unlimited access to pvp, unlimited access to galactic star fighter, access to 22(maybe more I don’t recall) operation activity which is a 20 man activity which changes every week, monthly in game currency grant once each month for however long you choose to be a sub, in game conveniences ( currency cap from 350k to unlimited, access to three crews skills from 1, access to decent gear called artifact gear, access to endgame worthy gear, being able to be the owner of your guild p.s. you loose ownership of guild if you run out of sub). After subbing for however long you do including one month you are given the privileges of preferred access, which has a ease on some of the restrictions but you don’t have access to operations, full access to pvp or galactic star fighter, in game conveniences. Overall I love swtor when I frustrate started playing it was an amazing opportunity to explore the Star Wars universe, on a technical point I am finding it a little difficult to return permanently other than the Autumn expansions and after frankly an investment of years and a fortune into the game, I still have the same privileges as someone who has only paid for one month of subscription.",1595463284,1595463284,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False
