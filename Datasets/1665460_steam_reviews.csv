How can this happen? Why did this happen? Incompetence or malice to make more money?

[h1][---Review History---][/h1]
[h3]Review eFootball v3.1.0:[/h3]
The game improves constantly. There are still minor gameplay issues:
- Physical Strong players don't use their arms to hold away opponents - the shielding mechanics slows them down and isn't useful. Just watch Harry Kane in real life and you know what is missing in the game.
- Air duels are random and not attribute based (heading, jumping, height). Mbappe wins more headings than Giroud. 
And now the big issues:
- Servers are hit and miss. One week you play without any lag, another week it's 500-900ms - unplayable.
- The ""script"" or ""DDA"" has never been stronger. Epic players allow for easy goals from impossible angles and distances, and automatically defend for you (P. Viera, E. Davids)
- There is no content. Since there is no account reset, there is nothing to play for after 2months.
- Power creep and overall inflation is a big issue. Rumors say Konami wants to increase overall player rating to 120 over the next year - awful!

All in all: Still the best football simulation you can find. But no content and lots of issues.


[h3]Review eFootball v3.0.0:[/h3]
eFootball 2024 has been released. The menu colors changed for the better. Good new additions like loaned players for events and gameplay based team colors and name. On the pitch the gameplay has massively improved. Left stick dribbling was buffed. Lots of new animations make players react quicker when intercepting or trapping the ball. This seems to be the best gameplay we have had for a long time with big changes.

Now for the bad.

The servers are sh**. On release day everything was smooth with low latency. Not even 1 week later, the server are so bad that you could also just decide the matches on a coin toss. Between 20ms and 800ms ping, everything is possible. On top of that 19/20 of the top20 players in the ranking are known cheaters. And even after many many reports Konami isn't banning any of them.

All in all: The best football simulation you can find. But avoid until Konami fixes their servers.


[h3]Review eFootball v2.6.0:[/h3]

In version 2.6.* they improved gameplay further. It's only little nuances and no big changes. However they implemented player progression reset. You can now pay GP (free ingame currency) to reset player attribute progression and re-choose all the points. There was also a short coop play test which was a lot of fun and will be introduced later on again.

Overall while there is some small progressive changes, I can only recommend the game for RTG (Road to glory / free only) players currently. Do not spend money, since the game still lacks proper features like game modes and game balancing. Especially the automatism of 1vs1 defending, and the high aim-assist of pass assistance 1 & 2 are serious problems. 

Then there is this weird momentum implementation: The longer you have no shot on the opposite goal, the likelier it is the next shot will go in.... absolutely dumb.

The players also freezing in place for several seconds when they lose the ball is a stupid design decision. Even further so, when suddenly it's not happening for an opponent player and you concede a goal because of it.

There is no sense of physicality in the match. Physical strong players like Haaland or Oshimen don't use their arms at all to keep the defenders away. A 100kg Maguire will bounce of 65kg Messi in an air duel. Speed is the most important attribute. 

And you still can't just push the ball 1-4m aside from an opponent and sprint after. Therefore senseless pressing with full speed sprints, like 7 year old youth players, is the best defending play.

And don't forget about the countless ""unfinished match""-cheaters. Whenever you win, they will somehow crash the server / game and the match won't count.

[h3]Review eFootball v2.5.1:[/h3]

In version 2.5.* they rebalanced passing. You now need to actually add the right amount of power or the passes are easily intercepted. A very good change! Overall the online connections and networking seem to be improved as well. But the greedy Konami company decided to change their pack model again to milk more money from players. Before you could buy 10 players + 1 big time player for a fixed sum of 1100 coins in so called ""team packs"". Now they removed them and instead we have a box of 50 players and you have to randomly draw players from it until you get the big time player. Absolutely greedy to get more money from players. 

That's why I can't recommend the game in good faith. The pachinco experts are milking the money out of players.

[h3]Review eFootball v2.4.0:[/h3]

The game is now automatically playing for you. You control 1 player and what the other 10 do is decided if the script/DDA wants you to win/lose whatever makes you buy more microtransactions. Only 1/5 of the match is decided by your skill. If a pass will get to a player (Pass Assist 3) is decided by the script. If a shot will go in or hit the post is decided by the script. If your AI players will intercept a pass is decided by the script. Since v0.9.7 I am a constant 80% win rate top 50 player. Now there are games I will lose against Division 5 players who have 1 shot on my goal from 25m which goes in while I have 14 shots from 11m.
Also all formations that are not META 4-3-3 have received a huge nerf.

DO NOT PLAY!

[h3]Review eFootball v2.3.0:[/h3]

This is so far the best iteration of eFootball. Everything has been improved compared to v2.2.0.
The only real issue left ist the precision of headers after normal crosses (not stunning) and normal headers (not stunning). They 99% of the time go above the goal even if the player has the Heading ability (head towards the ground).

In this state I can recommend the game to everyone!",1632977156,1704722091,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 Really hard to imagine how they turn this around this time since they insist on inclusivity and pay2win incentives.

Due to the extremely effective skill-balancing system, (always finding ways to keep the scores close, artificially increasing the winning side's error frequency higher, shots going into center, or the post too frequent), you were able to keep everyone invested in the game but what you actually accomplished was dumping everyone that aimed to ""GET GOOD"" at the game  while trying to keep the thrash noobs in.

In patch notes, the developers sound as if they are actively trying to fine-tune the experience but what they are actually doing is just reversing the things that required perception, anticipation and patience into things that favour ""recklessness"" and ""random chance.""

And the Legend AI, thats the LAZIEST thing i have ever seen. You challenge me with an 75 average overall team but there is nothing 75ish about that... Its like their stats are boosted to HEAVEN and my 1 year old dream team with all 95> stats means nothing ...

Incase your developers are NOT ill-intended businessmen; here is what the latest v2.2 introduced to the game....

1: Goal keepers are too powerful against shots. Game at least should require the defending player to modify the keepers position to be able to save those unchallenged shots.

2: Almost no goals outside the box, every match , everyone knows that keepers will save everything and thus everyone try to score the same goals inside the box.

2: When a pass is played to a direction where there are two players on that direction; game always chooses the wrong passing option(the one that will get intercepted or the player on the off-side), it does not take into account the pass power for determining the intended receiver.

3: When a pass gets intercepted by the opponent, the defenders gets confused and stop intercepting passes for a few passes, defenders despite their high defensive stats, act as if they have zero awareness. For example if your pass gets intercepted while a attacking, your opponent is able to pass to a very far player surrounded by 3 defenders easily due to defensive AI getting disabled for a few seconds.

4: Passes goes through defender's legs despite the defender's good awareness and ""interception"" skills.

5: Defenders losing balance and fall while trying to intercept the pass too frequently ( despite  80-89 defensive awareness and interception skill)

4:Only two marking options, it should at least be three. People abusing the lack of defence options by using 2 CFs and an SS , so either one CF or the SS will be marking free. This leads to the whole user base using the same counter attacking tactic.

5: When a pass is intercepted, the intercepting player gets unresponsive and transitioning into an attack gets more difficult than it should be due to bad passing+online latency+immediate team pressure.

6: Cant not dash around or through sprinting head-on defenders, can not avoid sprinting defenders, almost no fouls are given against powerful teams, game 

7: Players with high attacking stats and almost no defending attributes or skills , do incredible defending for the player un-attended. Benzema, man marking a winger, Neymar shadow-marking and AMF , these are all done in favour of helping out the reckless and inferior side while the winning side gets the opposite. this not FUN. 

8: There is no effective way to reach developers, no discord channel, not a responsive twitter account, no forums, no moderator response. No developer streams where they play their own creation online against other players.

This comment is basically eFootball based on the platform
(Next Gen) Xbox Series S: Worst next gen game ever....
(old gen) PS4: Never
PC: The graphics are garbage on each platform, but somehow it looks [i] slightly [/i] better and PC was marketed as old gen...
Gameplay wise though it turned out smoother, I'll take it if it was an Indie football game but the game is made by a multi-million dollar company with broken promises and lies.
I honestly liked some stuff in the game (talking about the PC ver.) but this isn't a game that was being developed for 3 years, way to go Konami with the downgrade.

{1.0.0 Review}
A bit lacking but it is definitely a step into the right direction, however we hope for more upgrades and fixes in the future.
Gameplay wise:
The game is fun to play yet we need more reasons/goals that make us want to play the game, wish to see that in Season 2.
For those who didn't play the game the gameplay is pretty much a Less robotic PES 2021 blended with EA Sports FIFA while still having the simulation approach (even though less simulation/more arcade-ish) and the Iconic PES feeling, I do like the new additions such as Power Shots, the new Tackling System (which is really good) and 2nd-Man Press (Learn EA, learn).
The U.I/Menus are unfortunately garbage and I hope they change the color scheme or we get option files, the player training/leveling system in Dream Team is miles clear than the old Gacha system and the old scouting system which is a bit tiresome and waste of GP.

Overall rating: I'll give it 6 or 7/10, I'll say 6.5/10

{1.1.1 Review}

It's basically PES 2021 all over again and SCRIPT being cancer as always, Kimura is such a Script whore.
5/10 just because it's Free and I like some of the core feature but gameplay definitely worse than before, I seen exploiters and low IQ whores who has 0 Ball knowledge but exploit the game to win because they're bunch of lifeless fuck I hope those kind of people kill themselves, game end your fucking worthless lives because all you can do is making the game worse for the community.

In offline match, we are still left with small chunks of teams. Authentic teams mode is just for checking the gameplay and nothing else.

There are significant changes from previous PES releases and these will take some getting used to.  But I do think a lot of the people complaining are being salty that their spamming tactics they've used for a decade can't be exploited in the same way.

But it shows that Konami wants to get away from the recycle-old-game-and-stick-a-new-name-on scheme. Some ideas and approaches are very good (more movements without the ball, cross-play, transitionless corners and throw-ins, etc...), but the implementation is very miserable. To be honest, even old functions that have always worked flawlessly are miserable now. In the end, this just shows how hard it actually is to bring a completely new game to market instead of remarketing the same game for full price. I like the approach of putting more effort into the football games, bringing new features and taking risks. It's a shame that PES flopped this year, but since it's free, you shouldn't bitch so much. Kudos to Konami for daring to make this right step. I'll wait for EFootball until it's ready.

Edit.

The updated version of EFootball is not comparable to the beta version which was very criticized. The game runs very smoothly and I hardly had any bugs, the graphics and animations look very realistic especially on high graphics settings. The game dynamics are rarely disturbed by fading to freekicks or throw-ins, the game continues to run while the players are getting the ball ready, which is very good. When there are cut scenes they are well used and hardly interfere. It feels more like watching a game on TV.
The game dynamics have also improved a lot, offensive players move smartly and the defense also makes few mistakes. In order to get a goal situation you have to either trick the opponent to open up passing situations or outplay the opponent with well-directed passes. At the moment, besides the friendly matches and online games, there is only the Dream Team mode, where you create and manage a team online and play against the AI or online games. It is good that you can buy the standard players directly and do not have to pull from ""packs"". These then start at level 0 and you have to level them up to their normal value and then you can go a bit beyond that. Very good I found here the possibility that you can choose the value upgrades yourself and thus can form your perfect player. You can e.g. skill MBappe to be more focused on speed and dribbling to let him play more on the wing or increase the values for finishing and attacking to set him up as a center forward. The choice is up to you. Since Efootball is free, there is a fear that the game will become pay-to-win. So far, however, I have been able to do well with my non-pay-to-win team and have not had the feeling that I had a big disadvantage compared to the other players. The good thing is that Featured players and the ""normal form"" of the same players usually have the same values when they are at the highest level. Featured players just start at a higher value and don't need to level up as long. Also, Featured players often have an alternate focus on skills. Only some legend players that are hard to get are a lot better than the ""normal"" counterparts. I would have been happy if legendaries had been just as good and you only acquired them, for example, if you were a big fan, so as not to break the balance of the game. But so far opponents had only 2-3 legends in the team and the difference was not so big that you have no chance against them.

All in all, I think the game is good, it's fun and brings a lot of new features. But some corners must still be tweaked.",1636486214,1656583947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Konami did a good job finally. This is much better that the initial release and improve a lot comparing to PES2021.
Gameplay:
Pass is nerfed, need more attention to do passing.
Defense is nerfed, it is hard to catch from back. Assist defense is not as effective as 2021.
Stunning shot/pass looks like a good idea.
Stamina recovered after each match. Great improvement. Do not need build two teams any more.
Individual strategy is back. I remembered it is kind of option in Winning 11 4 or earlier.
Player growth can now be managed by yourself, so you can build unique player.
Shooting in small angle become easier.
Protect ball is a must as it is too easy to lose the ball even from behind.
Music: Some music still sucks
UI: Optimized to remove lots of unnecessary actions
Graphic: No big improvement, seems worse especially the playfield.",1633023275,1656142181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played Konami football games since ISS in 1995 and pretty much all of the Pro-Evo games it comes as no surprise that this game needs work (same with all demo's they have ever put out), i have confidence that they will sort out many of the issues this game has (ball speed, player movement, lack of control while sprinting along with the optimisation it may need). 

But overall after playing both this and Fifa22 demo i can honestly say i prefer  eFootball over the arcade style of Fifa. Only time will tell if i am speaking out of my proverbial but so far this game is more what i want out of a football simulator than anything else out there.

This being said.... this is why I hate sports games. they are rushed to get the next ""next gen"" game out in a year, which means what needs updated and changed never actually gets done, and instead they either add/remove game modes, and re use code and graphics, barely updating anything. OR they focus TOO much on rewriting the code and changing gameplay and graphics, without properly testing the game for the platforms they get released on. Instead, how about we do 1 new sports game every 2-5 years, with small dlc updates to graphics and gameplay and code in between. Yes we would essentially have the same product for longer, but we already have that issue. This way if done like crusader kings 3 where you can turn dlc's on and off, they can slowly and properly work on updating the game for the next full release. Literally every problem with an every year release schedule would in theory be solved. But here we are... a product on par with 2k nba, and fifa, and somehow worse.

Now, on to more detailed feedback. Veteran since PES 3 with Collina on the cover, so I skipped the first match because the game wasn't allowing me to change the control settings. With that problem solved on the main menu, I played two games. One online, then one offline. No issue online, took a bit to find to an opponent but I think is rather normal at this time... 
It is a TOTAL revamp. You really can't even identify anything from eFootball PES 2021. Playability is rather realistic, in an awful way. I simply hate it. Itâs no FIFA, but itâs not good either. The player drifts like crazy and controlling the ball gets more complicated each year, needs more and more input. You either use like five fingers to make it do what you want or you loosing control of the ball is a rather realistic result. Tacking and pressuring also seems to be getting hard by the year and it achieved another level with this game. 

Menus are completely different and a bit confusing, but with some extra features. Still, its presentation is very basic, hopefully with more game features coming out, that will improve. Training, on the other hand, went from a full feature to a videoâ¦ Gosh! -_-â

It really feels like a new game from scratch, thus the number of bugs already identified. KONAMI should paid some of the money back. They just released the game and that's it. I paid 40â¬ for this premium thing, and yet it feels like I'm apart of some sort of beta testing... Honestly, what a waist of (my) money.",1633305630,1633305630,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first release was still too early in my opinion. Though the roadmap, which has been public for a while now, does clearly state that some of the main content will be provided as updates until early next year. 
Beside this and a few flaws here and there, it is fun to play. Physics and flow etc. are already much better than in comparable games (e.g. F..A). Though there is still room for improvement. As there has been in PES in the past. 
In the end a no-brainer for me.

For all players with negative reviews:
Check your graphics settings in game! 
I have no problem with 4K@120, it's running buttery smooth (RTX 3090).

1. graphic , the promise that graphic will be realistic as ever is just a lie , instead when you play sometimes it goes like the old tv that got black and white dots while you get antena shifted
2. FPS , they got good FPS in 2021 and I know that my VGA aint the brand new , but i dont think it will go max 30fps , underline the max because sometimes it's 20 and goes 30 
3. feature , this game only provide 2 type of games , online games with much wider choice of team , and casual (maybe offline) games that only have 5-8 teams that you can choose
4. training , WTH happened with training , it only play video from how they partner up with iniesta and pique to capture real life movement , no free training just a video , and why pique , not everyone like him 
5. control , not like in 2021 the sprint control is trash , you may often see your player cant hit the brake while sprinting, and also the through pass to the winger seems always overpowered
6. gameplan , absolute trash , cant change position (from CMF to AMF) , no guide , no overall rating standarization when you change player outside his assigned position , no tactics , just choose beetween style , the worst of the worst , absolute trash
7. price , this premium player pack price almost as pricey as 2021 , in Rupiah , it's 170K which is around 50K difference to 2021 , and doesnt get anything

Konami , If you dont change your game , everyone will turn to FIFA , I personally waiting for your promise for the 2022 PES or something you named game and will gladly pay the same price as FIFA or maybe a little more is alright , but instead you give it for free just to publish a trash games",1633039325,1633039405,False,1,1,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

Game is lagging like hell, players are disappearing from the screen and coming back, they are running through each other as if they were ghosts sometimes.
Collisions are awful, players are sliding, responsiveness is 0, net physics are embarrassing and pitch looks like its ps1 game.
Ball moves like its 20-kg heavy. 
Many controls are new & there is not even a training mode for you to try game out.
5 minute matches only, only 1 ball to select, rain or snow not existing only shows this is actually a demo version and Konami kept quiet about that but of-course they put up that pack online that you can buy for like 30-40 Euros even though they did not finish the game after taking 2 damn years.

1. Controls are loose as hell. Nothing close to the Winning Elevens or PESs in the past.
2. Animations and cut scenes are buggy and unfinished, during matches and otherwise.
3. They changed the control scheme! If it isn't broken, don't fix it! But Konami just had to tinker with the control schemes, and made them worse, with very little information in the tutorial.
4. Simplification of tactics. This is getting worse and worse. PES used to be complex, and can even direct how players run into space. Now its catered for mobile players who want things to be quick and easy.
5. AI's are terrible! Especially in defending!
6. Dribblers are over powered!
7. Re-cycled animations from the last two games.
8. Many of the features are still locked, including level of AI.
I'll think of others later.

However, I still would like to give this game a chance. 
Despite the bad things about it, there are some things that I like, such as:
1. It's FREE!!!
2. Pace of the game. It is paced much more like a real football match. 
3. Dynamic cameras. I really liked its application, despite the occasional bugs (slow to follow the ball).
4. Animations. Yes, I said they were bad, but only because they were jumps in sequence and overlapping. If Konami can fix this, it will very much improve the playing experience.
5. My favorite teams are licensed. 
6. Online was OK. I got matches quickly, and there was minimal lag. 

So would I recommend the game? Yes, try it out. After all, it's free and offers different experience.
I am just hoping that the updates could fix the negatives that I encountered.",1633002221,1633002221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Terrible 90s shadow quality rendered, I felt like the game is wasting the Unreal engine and have a way worse graphics compared to PES 2021/2020;
<Content> Bad even we are considering it is a free game with in-game purchase. This should be considered just a alpha-testing version. There is no shop, no build-team functionality available on the release date. We are earning GP at the launch date for nothing at the moment. (really shouldn't set the mantainance date the same date as the release date.
<Game-Play> Maybe the best spec found so far. But felt not very old player friendly. It is more FIFA player friendly.

Recommendation: Do not buy the in-game purchase, and let it be a free entainanment that you could play when you are tired with FIFA sometimes. Then this could be acceptable. I feel sorry for the developer who wasted there two years to developed this. And feel sorry for the executives who made the brave move  to dramatically ""revolute"" the game, but failed it as a result. Maybe this is the true end of the series. Long gone, PES.
