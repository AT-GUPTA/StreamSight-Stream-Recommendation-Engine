Be advised if it is not working the first time around. Don't waste your time trying to make it work. Before you know it you could exceed the alloted play time required to be able to get a refund. It was my loss for trying but lesson learned.

FFB is top tier, graphics are pretty solid for its age, lots of cars and content, physics are unrivaled. 
For those who don't know, rfactor is based on rFPro, which is one of the software packages that actual f1 teams and car manufacturers use for their driving sims. So while rFPro is pure sim, and rf2 is essentially its entertainment purposed twin sister, its built from true simulation blood.

There are still cars that use the old tyre model which has its own set of issues, so it's not a consistent experience either. Official content still runs into issues where it ""can't install"", so sometimes you're not even able to race online...

I bought almost all the content at the end of 2022 and I really liked most of it, then the GT3 cars got updated to the new tyre model which fixed powersliding being faster but the cars still feel floaty and to go fast you still have to pretty much slide the cars into the turn. I kept praising the BTCC cars for feeling really good but those also got changed down the line and now they feel weirdly floaty.
However, some cars still have the old powersliding tyre model, like the F4 and Radical ran on the online rookie rotation, so the game isn't even consistent with how the cars drive.

The way the tyres behave feels off, like they're worn or running basically flat.
The traction feels very numb, I have an extremely hard time telling where the peak is and the same turn never really feels the same. I don't have this problem with other simulators.
I know that it's faster to unload the car into a turn, by having the car go into a very low angle slide, but rF2 takes it too far and ends up feeling weird to drive.

Maybe it's just me feeling this way about the tyres, but I just can't recommend this game because I don't believe it does a good job at portraying how real cars drive like, especially when they market their stuff as being realistic

I just can't understand how the content manager is still having trouble. There have been a handful of online events, official mind you, where I get an error message saying it was unable to install the server mod because of missing content even though I had it all installed.
Sometimes it tells you which bit of content it is having trouble with, but most times I just get a ""welp, figure it out"". Reinstalling the game fully, by even removing the workshop/store content that Steam doesn't delete upon removing the game, hasn't fixed this issue for me so far and I'm most of the times just locked out of a race until it changes.

The online part is frustrating aswell.  Opening a server is a port forward hell,  nowadays we can buy servers too like on iracing paying per hour which does not fit with my small wallet. most servers have content you dont own,  so it makes you sit there waiting untill its downloaded a load of stuff you didnt expect before entering the server.  no cancel buttons here good old alt f4 everytime you suddenly get handed a nice dish of random content you cant even use because paywalls.

Bwoah...  such a fantastic game,  it really is...   but its ruined by its owners who either have to pay alot of bills to keep the game alive,  or are truly out there for the money,  making us buy buy buy buy BUY BUY BUY BUY....

The obvious thing to praise is force feedback. The way you can feel the weight transfer is just unreal (so real).

The sound is pretty good, but there are times when you can notice samples looping (especially with pit limiter on). Overall it’s not bad, not bad at all. Except… that pi pi pi pi pi sound when you adjust your camera. I hate it, but it makes me smile a bit, so I can live with that (it’s not really that big of an issue because you usually adjust the cockpit view once and then forget about it - unless you change to a different class car).

Positional audio (with headphones on your head) is amazing! I can hear every wheel screaming separately. I’m really impressed. This is a WIN for rFactor 2, as positional awareness is key in races.

The graphics are OK, not great, but there are times when the track and cars can look surprisingly good. What you see is more than passable. Tire deformation looks amazing! - it’s like a moving piece of art.

The UI has improved a lot, but there are parts of it that are just ugly.

There are quite a lot of updates, even pretty big ones like the way ABS works.

The modding community is amazing! You can find almost everything you can dream of, from cars to tracks, and even huds!

Now… there’s actually only one thing that really annoys me, and that’s the way you buy content. There’s a ton of different packs with overlapping pieces of content! Also the prices are a bit too high for an Eastern European simracing lover… I always hunt for sales, but they rarely offer the content I really want. You can buy every car and every track separately, but if you were to do that, you would become homeless. It’s ridiculous.

That’s all folks. Nothing about multiplayer because I only practice and race in rF2 offline (that may change though because there’s LFM!).",1681901956,1703087551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Physics? Great.
Graphics? Great.
Sound? Pretty damn good. 
Car and track variety? Honestly , it is stellar. In fact many tracks and cars I would never discover if it wasn't for rFactor 2.
But let's take a look at the negatives too. 
UI is...weird. They did an amazing job in comparison to the old UI which made me want to vomit but still , it is slow it is clunky it is not what I want it to be. Meaning more direct. More like Live for Speed. 
Damage model is non existent. At least not visualy. Sure your internal components and aero devices will get destroyed with impacts but the worst thing that can happen to the car is lose a wing. The body work doesn't bend even at 200+ kph impacts. 
[strike]And finally the online experience is just bad. LFM ( Low Fuel Motorsports ) is an iRacing like service now compatible with rFactor 2. Literally one of the biggest deal breakers is now fixed. Go buy the game and get involved! [/strike]

First of MARKETING - you are buying an empty game. NO tracks, NO cars. the devs even stole the cars that I did have. the version I bought years ago had some cars and tracks. Nope those are gone too, only unofficial mod tracks-cars remained.
GAMEPLAY. The pit lane AI is horrible. It starts good for the first few meters. Then in some tracks it turns sharply to hit obstacles on the side. In other maps AI calmly drives off line and into some van. or AI goes full throttle and spins. Surprisingly about 50% of the times AI finds the way out.
When the controls get released to the player my MOZA R9 goes full speed and strength to the right. Lucky it didn't caught my fingers. And that's it - the wheel remains turned right.

First, it's simply a challenge to start this boy. You have to install a couple mods so it launches properly. I've done that. Checkmark. Next, setting up your wheel through an in-game wizard is not possible. It doesn't allow you to complete the last step, so you have to go manually through all tabs and reassign controls yet again. It's the clumsiest wheel setup. 

Alright, how about picking a car for a race? Well, you have an incoherent menu of cars, many of which are displayed as unrecognized models -- they are covered with car covers. To make matters worse, some of the licenses have been revoked (BTCC), and there's no certainty that it won't happen again; so you might lose what you've paid for. Want to adjust difficulty? At low difficulty, the AI doesn't even start off from the grid! Want to exit or restart a race? Good luck with that, because once you press escape, you can't click on anything (and no, the option to allow the usage of cursor in menus doesn't work either).

I've managed to muster some patience only once to see what the ""glorious"" tire model is. The best I can describe it, it's akin to riding a bicycle where you feel very accurately what the wheels are doing and where they are facing. However, just like with the bicycle, where you don't feel what the frame is doing, in the similar manner you don't feel the car's weight and suspension at all. It's somewhat of a surrealistic feeling in quite a bad way.

For all the trouble you have to go through to set this brick of a software up, and then to constantly fight the game again and again, I don't think it's worth neither your time nor money, of which the developers are asking unjustifiably a lot for. 

There's AMS2 for a better single-player experience, and iRacing for competitive people. Both of them will be at least worth the money and the hassle.",1701621015,1701622026,False,6,1,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

If you've not tried rFactor 2 recently, do give it a try now the UI is getting better and the online racing is the best it has ever been. Kind of amazing for an old sim.
One of the best feeling simulators out there, but this comes at a cost.
The cost being that you need to put in a lot of effort to get this sim running well and need to be able to troubleshoot basic stuff that might go wrong.
When it does work, its simply the best driving experience there is. No other simulation or game comes even close.

Wow. It has taken 10 years but finally rF2 has the online people have been waiting for. This is one of the biggest issues I've had with the sim practically resolved. Hopefully this will bring back that same feeling I've had when playing Forza Motorsport 4, hopping into sessions and just having an absolute blast. The daily races are currently struggling due to much higher demand than thought possible, however the dev team have confirmed they are upping their server count to address this. As the service at time of writing is still in beta there are issues being found that will, inevitably, cause problems for us, however we are expecting the major issues to be sorted before public release. S397 have hit a good marker, and now hopefully there is enough interest in the sim to push it forwards. 

May 2023
A few of my gripes have been addressed, and we now have a full set of cars in terms of the BTCC Cars, however we still lack a few standout tracks, and we still have some serious game issues such as screen freezes affecting the experience. I am still confident in the development team but we are beginning to see the limits of what is at its' core a 10 year old game. There is still a lot of improvement, such as the new hybrid implementation, so there is still hope for what continues to be the best feeling game I have ever played, even with my clunky old G920

Jan 1 2022
As we head into the new year we need to address this. rFactor 2 is a brilliant sim to drive, excellent feeling and has one of my favourite set of GT3 cars. Unfortunately this is the only real complete set of cars in the series that is not a 1 make series. It is steadily becoming apparent that between the lack of complete series and the lack some serious tracks and cars in the base game, rFactor 2 is losing all the potential the team at S397 clearly have. 

ISI was a very, very long time ago and tracks like Bathurst, Estoril and Interlagos are starting to look out of date. The quality difference between Portland and Portugal for example is insane and unfortunately since the purchase of S397 by Motorsport games it doesn't look like the game is going to be used how we hoped. Studio 397 have the best platform and a game truly capable of rendering out some very pretty graphics in the engine, and with the right direction the developers could take over the sim racing world.

For me personally, I am 100% on board with everything studio 397 is doing to improve the driving feel. However, as a product, if the Motorsport Games licences don't allow S397 to benefit content wise from their championship releases, the game will now grow like it should. A lot of content from Indycar, the BTCC and NASCAR is in the motorsport games family right now and truly this should be the beginning of a new era for this game. 

Here are a few points that would massively improve the game as a product;

- The UI
Starting with the obvious part. Anyone who has used rFactor 2 will know about the new UI. It is good in concept but the layout is confusing and set up all wrong. Multiple levels of tabs with the same name showing different information is not conducive to a good user experience. Simplifying the tabs into 1 level with more descriptive tab names would fix the majority of issues.

- The Multiplayer System
As rFactor 2 is Mod Heaven, it is highly likely that any servers you load into would include content, or versions of content, you might not have. A screen when loading in to tell you what content is missing or mismatched would be ideal for problem solving on joining servers. 

- The Competition System
This iRacing competitor is one of the best additions to rFactor 2 and is a hugely promising part of the new games dynamic. My biggest gripe with this system is that there is no pre-lobby. If you miss the second the qualifying sessions open, you don't make it into any lobby. A simple pre-lobby with private practice that would then shuffle out into the Qualifying sessions would be a godsend. I doubt it would be easy to implement but would certainly work better for users.

Overall, the game is beautifully made and a true passion project from everyone at Studio 397. I would love to see the game go from strength to strength with this ownership under Motorsport Games. I believe that the Content issue is well under control with this, but there are things Studio 397 can improve off their own back. If you adore driving over anything else, then rFactor 2 is a game for you, but you need to be prepared to spend on content you might expect in other games and be able to navigate the UI. 

The driving is so worth it though.

Mar 14 2021
Excellent racing sim even if the base content is sorely lacking. Unfortunately this seems to be a standard across the board, so compared to other sims such as iRacing it doesn't put it down too far. Consistent updates, new content, and a massive effort by the newly-acquired Studio 397 have made this an asset for Motorsport Games. I hope that the S397 Platform is developed and used with what has to be one of the most accurate simulations of current times.",1615716533,1696765235,True,9,2,0.576780974864959717,0,True,False,False

Fix for AMD owners - Downgrade to 22.5.1 driver
2nd Update on Review - It's a crashing mess now, unplayable.


Updated review - 
It's improving a lot lately, quarterly updates to physics, graphics, UI even UX, AI fixes, good mod support (via steam workshop itself), new contents. The multiplayer is kinda dead, but for having a great track day or AI race it's great (better than AC1). I have like 150 modded tracks downloaded currently. Car collection is decent, look for sale for DLC content shopping, you get like 60% off. 

If you use Simhub overlays and get lag, turn on vsync. 

and it's a good one to get on sale.

review of older versions - 

The UI v2 was ok, v3 was not urgent but that came out, but the HUDs are still like playing DOS game. I uninstalled it last week because in a car/track combo I was trying it wont let me out of the pit lane in the practice session, that car had no pit limiter and it kept on giving me penalty even when I hardly exceeded limit, I tried the auto-pit lane assist mode and the auto pilot can't drive, it banged into walls every time. What's the point of having it on disc if I can't get out of pit lane. 
Also if you make the AI level little low, they give up on driving and never reach T1. WIll try this after HUDs & AI after upgraded to 2000 A.D. standards. The ""high standard"" physics only come into the play once driver is on track, I wish I can reach the track.",1644324089,1693856418,False,0,0,0.460284948348999023,0,True,False,False

I'm a big fan of the 1960's GP cars and this sim has provided me with everything that I'd want, I used to play Grand Prix Legends but in my humble opinion this game is far better. The choice of add on cars and tracks that can be downloaded for free through the steam workshop is amazing, in fact the wide range of different era cars and tracks is ideal for those of us that want a sim that caters directly for our own specific taste. Like i said, I'm a 1960's GP racing fan and I was able to get the appropriate historic tracks and complete car sets which allows me to race in the era that i'm mostly interested in.

The highlight for me is the way in which the cars handle, the force feedback really gives a good sense of grip, loss of traction and wheel lockups. if you can get your wheel set up correctly then you'll be very impressed with the variety of different handling characteristics that each car has. 

i also have to give the developers full credit for the weather, its pretty amazing how the sky will suddenly become grey and overcast and then spots of rain start to appear, before you know it you can be in a total downpour. it seriously feels very realistic, obviously the rain will impact on your race and that's the fun of this sim, do I pit now or risk a few more laps!

If you're thinking of buying rFactor2 and you're a fan of NASCAR, IndyCar, LMP/WEC, DTM. modern F1 or historic (the list is endless) then why not give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

TLDR: I love it, but just get assetto corsa.

Very realistic sim with a very aggressive monetization model and unfriendly UX for new players. The base game should really be free if they are going to be charging what they do on basic DLC packages - you could probably spend $500 on this game if you just bought everything. For that price I could have quite the sim rig and take slightly worse tire simulation in assetto for way better immersion, and every map / car combo I could want.

The default RF2 cars don't feel great at first - you must tune the tire pressure, braking bias, etc or it will not feel right out of the box. Maybe the DLC cars are better with default settings but I have no experience with that. This only bothered me the first time or two I played it.

The UX for new players is not good. It's hard to differentiate practice sessions from races, and as far as I have found so far I don't think there's any game mode that doesn't have track limits or AI (like a free play mode for practicing).

Alright, time for my recommendations to fix everything. RF2's monetization model is currently based on single-time purchases of DLC packs and the sale of the game itself. This means that the majority of players will probably spend only $30 for the base game, without buying DLC. Players who are dedicated to the game will probably pay $40 - the game + one DLC for their favorite track. $40 per player for a racing game is not terrible but, not great (sim racing games, as a niche, are not very profitable in general). Instead of milking your audiences, encourage your audiences milk your game. The more time invested into the game the more likely people are to spend money on it. If I were the developer of this game, I would make a currency system and then lock a minority of highly desired content based on that currency. Every lap completed / pole position in races and such would give coins. When you earn enough coins, you spend them to unlock a DLC. That sounds unprofitable but it motivates players to spend time in the game (companies like Anzu will pay per impression for in-universe & non intrusive billboard advertisements and make an SDK you can embed in the game). I personally made over $2000 from anzu on my game in the first month of introducing it (my game has 27,000 DAU), and to be fair I didn't even integrate it properly so that could have been more. Secondly, adding a store to purchase more coins is crucial. This is where the bulk of the games revenue will come from. Everything is free to obtain, but at the cost of the player's time. If the player wants to get access to Spa, like me for example, they have to spend their hard earned coins or their hard earned money in order to get coins. Doing it this way minimizes the value being traded in people's head, so all these negative reviews about how greedy you are won't exist because if the people complaining about that really wanted to, they just need to put in more time to get it free. When you make people think of paying $10 to save hours of grind instead of just paying $10 for some lousy track, it makes it a lot easier for them to hand over money (critical in an environment where your competitors give this content for free). It also means you build your community because people who don't want to pay in money will pay in time and vice versa. Building the community means building publicity, and building publicity means getting more contracts with motorsports series, getting more money from advertisers, and getting more players who buy the game to interact with other players. Players get the opportunity to choose which tracks / content is most important to them to spend coins on while motorsports games profits by charging a lot to people who can pay a lot and charging little to people who can't pay a lot. The final thing I will say is, invest in yourselves. If you invest in yourself and make this game a place where people can come chill with friends and open it up to a multiplayer mindset, you will see the strength of your community grow and the momentum that builds carry your game forward even when you do not.

Steam says this game was released in 2013, but it feels more like it's from 1999 and has not been improved since then. Yes, there is a ton of content in the steam workshop, and yes, it's a sim racer where people are used to some pain with the UI, setup, and graphics. But come on, it's 2023.

The bare minimum they would need to change to get me to recommend this:
* make the game auto-detect an X-Box Controller (the absolute standard), allow to assign reasonable default controls (there even is a profile you can manually load, but the button assignments are absolutely terrible), and remember my input settings for the next game launch (!)
* make the graphics at least a tiny bit better
* make the UI a lot less clunky, more consistent and fix the broken parts (e.g., auto-update is on but it does not auto-update for me, the car selection page is a mess, some entries are by class, some by manufacturer, some by something I do not even get, maybe a sales pack they were part of)
* ship it with at least 1 high quality car and track, without the need for the workshop (see below).

For me, the installation of the 3 available content packs failed on first try (all of them gave an error), and when I clicked on Singleplayer, it turned out I could not race at all because I had 0 tracks and 0 cars installed. I managed to get them from the Steam workshop eventually of course (you can even do it in-game, though the interface is slightly strange), but it took ages and I was above the 2h refund time already before I could start my first race. 

Once in the race, no botton was assigned to disable the speed limiter (for the pitstop area), and it seems when you enter the menu, there is no obvious way to resume the game, you have to restart it seems (I just can't find the resume button, I am sure there must be one somewhere). What the hell. Even understanding what was assigned to the buttons was impossible, because the game seems to understand that this is an Xbox controller, but still does not display the correct buttons. Also the controls were unusable because of the sensitivity in-game, even though dead zone and sensitivity look fine in the config tool preview. I spent quite a bit of time trying to tweak them and they are slightly better now, but they still feel very bad. The next time I started up the game, it ignored my controller completely and I had to reload the profile in the menu first.

Yes, people who invested 1000h into this game are gonna hate me for writing a bad review after installation, and I am sure that a lot of this is really minor compared to all the fun you can have with it if you invest a lot of time but: if I pay for a game, I expect a bare minimum: to be able to start my first lap within a few minutes after the game has been installed by Steam, with a standard input device. And even though I am not a graphics addict, I gotta say this game is really, really ugly.

When the game actually works, the driving physics are superb; no complaints there. It's a great sim.

- Graphics *can* be stunning: track details on high quality tracks are very comprehensive

--------

Some background first...
I've been playing driving games and sims since the 90's, and have been doing real life track driving since 2005. Other sims and games i've played are Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, iracing (for many years), Dirt Rally, Dirt Rally 2, Gran Turismo (all of them), Forza Motorsport 3 & 4, Forza Horizon (all of them) and many more. I've played most of these on a reasonably basic wheel setup, currently a Thrustmaster T300RS mounted on a basic stand in front of a large TV or monitor.

In terms of actual simulated race driving experience, RFactor2 is my favourite sim. This comes from a solid combination of physics, track/car graphics modelling and immersive sound. When you 'enter' your car in your pit garage and hear other cars start up and leave pit-lane, the sounds are very convincing. Similarly while on the track, the engine noise and noise of other cars on track is immersive. In terms of physics, this is also convincing, at least for the official GT3 cars that I tend to gravitate towards in any sim. Steering feel and feedback is great, so you know when you are reaching the limits of adhesion and can react accordingly. Tyre flat spotting is captured also, so if you lock a wheel in a braking zone or slide off-track, chances are you will have a vibration through the wheel, of varying degree depending how bad your sin was.

The graphics are the most inconsistent part of this game, and I suspect that is one of the main things that puts a number of people off. Some original track content plus DLC is absolutely stunning and at the top level in my opinion. Tracks like Spa, Bahrain, La Sarthe, Laguna Seca, Donington and Sebring for example (there are others) are represented really nicely and in great detail. The same can be said for the cars, the DLC GT3 and GTE cars are great, among others. The lighting in the game is done realistically rather than having that perfect beyond reality feel that console driving games tend to have. On a dull overcast day, things look very dull and boring, but kind of as they should. Low sun conditions with shadows are suitably spectacular. On large tracks in-particular you can see different lighting conditions within the same lap if the weather is cloudy. Large tracks and large fields of cars can test the limits of your system. For example, Nordschleife won't load on my system unless I drive with only 1 or 2 competitors. All other tracks will load, but smaller fields are sometimes required to keep frame rates acceptable. People who like to upgrade regularly aren't likely to have any of these problems though. Obviously graphics settings affect this, and personally there is only so low I will set those before I don't bother playing.
Regarding AI quality, at times this can be great, and other times not so much. You can have a high quality battle with other cars on track if your driving is also at a high quality. If you drive erratically or heavily offline you may just get punted out of the way rather than avoided. On some tracks there can be some AI bugs also, like not being able to enter pit-lane for example.

Where things get weird is that some of the content that comes with the sim is at a completely different level. When I first installed it for example, I first went to drive the Calsonic GT500 Nissan GTR at the Sepang circuit and found the experience very underwhelming to the point that I uninstalled the sim shortly later. Months later I gave it another shot and discovered the joys of the quality cars and tracks available. Even some of the cheap DLC content though is not at a high enough level in my opinion.

Finally, online play. I haven't actually managed to race online yet. In some cases I had issues installing the correct content which I couldn't resolve. Other times I wasn't online at a time that a session was available that I did have the content for. This can only get better though. After years and many hours of playing iracing, the gold standard for online play, my interests these days have been more about having a more brief but immersive offline racing experience.

Overall, with the right cars and tracks, the driving experience in RFactor2 is really hard to beat, and that's why I recommend it.

Dont get me wrong, im saying this as a simracer with a simrig.
Im moostly talking about, feedback by wheel, seatmotors aswell as physic's behaviour comparing to my experience with other sim racing games.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

've raised my eyebrows (and started an evil laugh or so 've been told by others when something leaves me with a good impression), when i felt the back wheels losing a minimal amount of grip of witch i thought i was a bit better in than this. This only made me happy as it gave info that i was missing in other simracing games.

After the first corner, i was sure this wasnt a bad buy for me.  
(Its also the first time in a sim my body was expecting any kind of Gforce as i turned into the first corner).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also use the program SimHub, combined with chairMotors, diy digital and analoge gauges and works as a charm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sim supports multible controllers:

Started playing this with a T500RS Wheel and due to the fact its slowly degrading bit by bit becouse of many many many many many years.
ve upgraded the base to a ts-pc base.

The Thrustmaster TS-PC Racer Ferrari 488 Challenge Edition to be more presies,
and can confirm that it works like a charm with RF2. 
(you need a 3e party software if you want to use the leds on the wheel with RF2)


T3PA-Pro pedals.

A diy E-brake and key-ignition buttonbox in one.

TH8A Shifter.

curve screen on 4k nonsence.

and supprise supprise a,
Logitech Heavy Equipment Side Panel.

And everything works with RF2 at the same time. 
(NOTE: i did turn off the controller stuff on steam on every game b""couse it screws up every thing controllerwise with moost games otherwise).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People say the sim looks a bit dated but, so do i.
Honestly, i dont see it that much, expected way less.

The IA is aparently really bad but learns as you play longer.
(maybe im wrong and it had just a couple of dumb mistakes, to soon to say). 

I had no issues sinds i started the game for a race.

I did had some issues before that:
Simhub could autofix the data files at first start.
The sim itself, after asking my name it asked for the non working asigning wheel movemenst and buttons that 've skipped.
After that it couldnt install any of the installpackages leaving me with the option to quit game or continue without cars and tracks.
This easily fixed by quitting game, let steam do its auto installupdates without asking, check my simhub that fixed itself after it was done. restart the game and wait for about an hour or two to install the missing files.
(watch a series, eat some dinner, having a laugh. also coffee, coffee was really really good).
I finally when back to check when it was done and then the customizing of setting where next.
(turning all the assists off, minimal hub settings, assigning all the buttons and finetunings of hardware).

Then it was time to try it out on the track and o boy,
I think this will be one of the few sim games that 'll keep playing on a regular basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bad:

I do miss a physical pit crew that changes the tires and lifting a sign or something to show you when they are ready 
(especially bcouse i keep spacing out instantly when im not doing anything).

The IA still likes to (Not just nudge) ram you aside so it can pass when you are in the way.
(im not sure if its still learning or not but it could be worse).

The pit crew car menu is a bit clunky to controll but it might be due to a new button layout on this new wheel as it makes me slow by doing so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:

So,
Even do i dont like to review to soon, im the short firsttime of trying out this sim,
I can absolutely say that this is what IM looking for in a sim.
(If my oppinion changes, this review will be eddited).

Its a Great sim with an amazing amount of telementry data to give back to the player via hardware especially when using simhub.

I was a bit sceptical about how good it would be when i saw it on discount and expected to be a ""meh or okay"" after a lot of ytubers recommanded it.

If you are looking for the following in a simracing game then im saying this might be for you:
-to race in online aswell as offline
-Better than a lot of other simracing games with there telemetric feedback, (i cant compare to Iracing) 
-NOT having to pay money monthly
-laser-scanned circuits
-you are semi serious/or serious in simracing
-Not having to buy dlc's
-accurate physic behaviour (as far as 've notised)
-Using atleast a Wheel instead of a controller or use a full SimRig
-Using Simhub with diy or other bought/modded hardware
-Not looking for more that this, Then try it out especially when it's on a discount
-aparently Expect a couple of bug's (i havent seen any yet)
-An IA that's AT LEAST, LESS dumb then moost games. (have to test more)
-You dont mind the IA having more grip than you ever will aswell as Clutchkick better than you ever will be able to as a human.",1684958225,1685104126,True,3,0,0.536532342433929443,0,True,False,False

A pity, I loved the original rFactor back in the day.

I did not experience other issues mentioned recently, but:
- I had to restart the game for it to actually start reading inputs from my wheel/shifter.
- for that I had to wait while it downloaded something (apparently the content pack I selected earlier but the game told me it could not connect get Steam subscription(wtf?) or something and I assumed I'm left without tracks/cars for now, but then the progress window popped up out of nowhere, like in a couple of minutes after I tried to find the packs in UI).
- FFB did not work out of the box with t300rs, apart from steering limits. But it might be related to SteamVr crash I mentioned above (the game felt really sluggish which one would not expect on a 7950X+4090 combo).

----

Top racing game with near endless amounts of tracks, cars and messing about to make it work.

Essential PC facts: 9700KF i7 & AMD 5700 XT. G29 and the home 4k 65"" TV.

Graphics - once you realise how to enable everything (the front end isn't real smart, or I'm not, probably both) then you can crank this game up to current standards without much hassle. But... not all mods are created equal and if you're into some exotic weird stuff you may find yourself racing back to time before polygon count. 

Physics - Well, I've struggled. Which I think means it's good. Actually it is. The racing is fantastic to be honest. Biggest issue is flat spotting tyres then having a nearly unraceable car thanks to G29 shake. It's ended up with me turning off tyre wear to be honest as a first corner avoidance can ruin a whole race.
Other than that the cars generally handle amazingly - I'm blown away by the work people put in.

UI - Yeah, this is at best simple, but worst it's one of the worst game UIs out there. But it is functional, and like that bike you've had at the back of the garage for the past decade it'll still work, just not in flash ""I'm the latest eEverything that is out there"" kind of way. I tried the new Beta UI, many times in fact before it worked. And hats off to the devs for making it harder to navigate!

Multi-player - This is the very best and worst of this game. Best... it's possible to set up a race with a few mates, fill the grid with decent AI and have a night's racing in weird cars on your local track (almost certainly). But... creating those races effectively, setting up the server, making sure they have the same add-ons and cars. Yeah.... we ended up spending several nights planning and setting up the process so we can get on and race in relative comfort. It most certainly is no Pcars2 on the PS4.

Sound - Do you know, I don't know... mostly as it's not remarkable. Or it's just right. Dunno - It's not going to be the best out there, but does seem to get on and work.

Overall...

Pros: Amazing content if you're prepared to find it (most is in the workshop on steam in fairness), great racing and ability to race few mates with a full grid. Racecraft is excellent in handling and AI cars.

Cons: I've re-installed it a few times now. IT's just hard to use right and is clunky to set up and operate. God knows how they run production quality events on this game. 

Summary: This is a self assembly toaster. Get it right and you'll enjoy crunchy goodness every time. Get it wrong and you'll be burnt as you pull it apart and start again, and forever wondering if you'll get the same outcome the next time.

----

Post edit and update...

The summary is spot on still, but this game isn't relevant any more.
My racing has moved on to a DD1 and 3080 Ti, allowing more current games really stretch their legs, but RF2 has remained what it was and even with the updated UI and an attempt at more content - that's an outdated game that's been surpassed by the industry.
The mix of mods and trying to make a night's racing work is just a chore - getting AC and Content manager makes the mad mix of content pointless, it's accessible in AC with ease. If you prefer DLC, then AMS2 and RRRE are both fine games and between them cover the all the relevant content here with ease.
Overall, unless you have a real love of something that's unique to this game, or just this game in particular (and if you do, then I'm willing to bet you have a 3/5 assembled UK sports car in your garage) then go for it, otherwise, get with the current world and pick up  game that feels it's from this decade at least.",1591919077,1683116550,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- This game is a little aged, but looks and sounds great.
- The physics in this sim are incredible.
- There's plenty of mod support.
- The racing feel is accurate and many settings can be configured.

And while, for people who have not had technical issues with the game, this might be great... It was NOT the case for me.

The game is an incomplete, buggy train wreck. When you purchase a product, be it a game, or anything else, you should have at least a very basic expectation that THAT product will work. It should NOT be up to the user to spend hours trying to figure out how to MAKE it work, troubleshoot and dive into forums to figure out why it won't work. And spend ALL that time doing just that, and not actually enjoying what they paid money for.

It pisses me off when companies have the balls to release a product and take money from people, but can't e bothered to ensure that product is sound in workmanship.

For all the great things this sim has the potential for, it did not even start for me, and for that reason I can't even begin to think about recommending it to anyone, for any reason. If you want a great sim that's cost effective, has VERY LITTLE DLC and plenty of mod support, get Assetto Corsa.",1683068192,1683068192,False,43,4,0.643826544284820557,0,True,False,False

I really hope the community grows massively for this sim in LFM.

To the developers : Please make the game as user friendly as possible to get as many people to play this game as possible.

One issue is the way in which you have to install all cars that are in a race just to race one car that you bought against others. I know its not rocket science but to make it more user friendly for new comers, they should be able to buy a car and then race as long as they also own the track also.

Another thing that would help is an easy preconfigured option for graphics like low, medium and high for both VR and screen. Also of course people can chose advanced to manipulate their own preferences.

I bought it some years ago and I asked for a refund because it doesn't support my old wheel at the time (it crashed). 
But I have followed the game development here on steam and I saw a consistent update, so I buy it again, prepared to race with  a great game, but only with my joypad. Surprisingly, I am very happy about it: my wheel now works perfectly and the game has improved soooo much... 
Let's start.
Yes, the physic engine is fantastic, the tire model gives an unique road feedback, and it is one of the few games where the tire deformation is clearly visible graphically. Really exciting. It is absolutely frightful to drive at 230 km/h and seeing how the car is realistically oscillating due to aerodynamics and tire/ground interaction, pretty unique sensation.
The graphics are improved very much with the new DX11 engine, nothing more to say except is very good.
The game is heavily based on Steam Workshop dowloadable content. In this sense the game is very mod oriented like Assetto Corsa 1, but with the advantage that all is dowloadable from workshop, not only external sites.
Do not trust who says this in the only realistic driving sim on the market: AC Competizione and other racing sims are really realistic too. Simply this sim gives an unique handling feeling, very realistic, and recreates with great fidelity real driving sensations. But all those sims are really fantastic and watching racing sessions has the same feeling of real races seen on TV. I think one of the best way to know if a racing sim is realistic is to verify how lap times on a determined track are compared to real life one, and in this sector both RF2 and ACC really shines.
The sound compartment can be vastly improved compared to ACC, but it is not so bad.
Force feedback is good, and can be reset with a simple key press, and this is a winning choice to solve every casual bug.
Finally, the sim has lower technical requirements compared to other sims, and this is very good, especially with so wonderful physics.

There are some bugs, but overall a great, exciting racing experience, for sim lovers.

EDIT: Sadly I have to notice there are many issues yet... Xbox360/One has no native vibration support, often wheel Force Feedback is inverted (instead of pulling the wheel to the center it pulls it on right or left, and it is not related with understeer or oversteer, it happens at any speed and also in straightways) and often multiplayer downloaded content for joining a server doesn't install at all. If these problems will be fixed in the future the sim will be a perfect one, until now it is a rough diamond.

EDIT 2, 28th of march 2023, 26 hours of playing later. The biggest, immense problem of this sim os BROKEN multiplayer; rarely you will have success with entering a race; moro, more, more often (practically ever) you will have messages about missing AND NOT INSTALLABLE content. I AM TIRED OF HAVING A NEAR 1OO GIGABYTES OF A WONDERFUL SIM PLAYABLE ONLY IN SINGLE PLAYER. And don't tell me to contact support: I did it months ago and they did nothing. PLEASE FIX IT!!!

First of all, let's talk about the physics. The way these cars handle is just like the real thing. The tire models, the suspension, the aerodynamics - it's all been meticulously crafted to give you the most authentic racing experience possible.

And the graphics, well, they're simply stunning. The level of detail on these cars and tracks is second to none. You'll feel like you're actually out there on the circuit, pushing your car to the limit.

But what really sets rFactor 2 apart is the sheer amount of content available. There are tons of mods out there, so you can race just about any car on any track you can imagine. And the DLCs are fantastic too - they add even more cars and tracks to the game, all of which are of the same high quality as the base game.

But here's the thing, folks - rFactor 2 isn't just for hardcore sim racers. It's accessible enough for beginners to jump in and start having fun right away, but also has enough depth to keep even the most experienced racers coming back for more.

In short, rFactor 2 is the real deal, folks. The realistic physics, gorgeous graphics, and vast amount of content make it a must-play for any racing fan.",1678475773,1680027880,True,4,0,0.5331307053565979,0,True,False,False

Like many, I got into sim racing through Assetto Corsa, but it was starting to show its age so I decided to make the step up to a 'proper', 'modern' simulator.

rFactor 2 is neither of those, but I didn't know that at the time. The reviews all raved about the accuracy of the physics and the incredible FFB, and I got sucked in. What I didn't notice about those reviews is that most of them are quite old, and there are not very many of them, at least on Steam. This game is not as popular as it thinks it is, with a monthly average of around 500 concurrent players worldwide.

With such a small active player base it can't be easy to do extensive testing before an update is pushed, so the players are also unpaid Beta testers. This is a very bad idea, because the early adopters are generally the most passionate fans, and the most resistant to change.

Don't bother trying to connect with the small rF2 'community' through the forum either. I have rarely encountered such a toxic group of raging fanchildren. And I mean children, literally. It's clear from some of the forum posts that the loudest complaints against whatever the latest update has changed are coming from people who have never driven a real car, let alone raced one.

There are a few sensible and knowledgeable people on the forum, some of whom have been pointing out shortcomings in the tyre model and aero physics for years which could be exploited to gain faster lap times, but they tend to be shouted down. When the devs did eventually take them seriously, the improvements took years to implement - and are proving to be unpopular despite being much more realistic. Conversely, unpopular changes are 'hotfixed' in a matter of hours, in response to a tiny but vocal group of people. Having watched this happen recently, I seriously question whether this simulator is really as accurate as people like to believe.

Yes, the Force Feedback is decent. With a good car and a Direct Drive wheel, you do get excellent information through the wheel. However, it's not any better than the competition. I don't doubt that the FFB in rF2 was a game-changer five years ago. Sim racing has evolved hugely over the last few years, and Direct Drive wheels are no longer just for the super-rich or super-nerdy. All the other sims have caught up, and offer equally impressive FFB.

The User Interface is terrible. It's better then it used to be and it's been revised several times to get to the current shambles, which essentially sums-up the entire game.

The graphics are dated. The cars mostly look OK, but the tracks are horrible. Mod tracks are particularly bad, with flat trees and assets straight out of Minecraft.

The AI used to be terrible. It has recently been significantly improved, and it's now mediocre. Rather than constantly brake-checking you, they drive like you don't exist and run you off the track.

By far my biggest issue is with the content. It's a shambolic mess of random cars and tracks, even if you buy the expensive DLC packs. Most of the DLC is incomplete or out of date - for example, although the GT3s just got an update, there is no Lamborghini or Acura and the Ferrari is the older 488. On the other hand, you do get the Bentley, Audi and Camaro.

There aren't enough official tracks to do a complete series - Oulton Park and Silverstone are missing, for example, so you can't do the complete BTCC or British GT3 calendar. To bulk out the paid DLC you can use mods, but there are nowhere near as many as there are for AC, and the quality of them is highly variable. Confusingly, many of these 'mods' are (old) official cars and tracks from previous incarnations of the studio. Most of them haven't been updated for years. Some of the cars are barely driveable because the simulator's physics engine and tyre models have been updated and the mods haven't.

rFactor 2 crashes a lot. It has frozen while I was joining a server several times. When it freezes, it completely locks me out, and I have to restart Windows - which means completely re-initialising my wheel, SimHub, CrewChief and my head-tracking software, all in the few minutes before the race starts. This would be OK if it wasn't for rFactor 2's signature move, which is completely reassigning all your USB devices for no apparent reason, so it doesn't recognise your button box, shifter or wheel and you have to frantically reassign everything because you can't steer your car. It also disconnected in the middle of an online race, and half the field lost as many as six laps. Some didn't rejoin at all.

I actually started uninstalling this game, and got as far as unsubscribing from all the additional content to save drive space. The only reason I changed my mind was because Low Fuel Motorsports added rF2 to their roster of supported sims. That's not aging well, and the entry lists are dropping off already, so I'm slowly uninstalling the mods again.

On the plus side, rF2 does have weather and night / day cycles. Newsflash: Nobody actually wants to race in the rain. I did one LFM race in the rain and it was a truly horrible experience. I did come third though, mostly because everyone else either DNF'd or rage quit! Some people even quit before the race started.

Despite the slick-looking exterior, fancy website and strong media presence, the overall operation seems to be very small. One person appears to handle all of the public interaction - Facebook, Twitter, press releases and website updates. There's nothing wrong with wanting to play with the big boys, but if you do, you have to be able to take a few knocks. rFactor 2 can't. It's all mouth and no trousers.

I feel I've given rFactor 2 a decent go. I've done lots of hotlapping and practice races with AI, and a dozen or so online races with LFM. I did try rF2's own online system and I couldn't ever connect to a race. My overwhelming feeling is that this is an obsolete sim with little chance of improving.

If you don't mind troubleshooting, figuring stuff out and not being able to ""plug-and-play"" it might even be a recommendation!

To fully enjoy rFactor 2 it requires a lot of maintainence and troubleshooting, both client and server-side. Things will break, sometimes even horribly. This game is not ""plug-and-play"" there are almost no servers that you can join with the base content / servers are empty.

If you want to play with your favorite GT3 Car, you have to buy the bundle. Why ? Because you need ALL the paymods the server is currently running in order to join the session. It would benefit S397 to let everyone drive on servers featuring paymods, but to actually drive the vehicle you need to purchase it.

Settings can be a pain in the ass, rFactor 2 is deeply customizable in its driving experience and features a lot of options, if you find them. Most options are hidden from normal players because they are hidden inside the individual config files. You either have to find it out by yourself or find it on some forums. A good documentation would fix this.

Rf2 just needed one Race to convice me. To be precise the first duel in racing conditions.
Came for the AI, stayed for ... everything - and AI. Yes, it falls short on the EyeCandy-side (a little), but at 280 km/h you dont notice it that much.
Physics alongside FFB are top (for what i can tell). And there is a diligent Mod-Community providing most of your beloved tracks. For Cars i stuck with official Content for now but cant wait to experience the Fun-potential of the modded Vessels.

Wouldn't have thought switching to another sim was THAT easy. After +1000 hrs (!) in AC my next ""Sim-Contender"" had to deliver a lot! Well, rf2 did. I'm glad i gave it a try.

Edit: Almost 200 hrs in - still lovin' it. New DLC  Le mans is a blast. Cant wait for the laserscanned Nordschleife.

I doubt many people start sim racing with rF2 and expect most to start with more accessible games like GT or iRacing. But for those considering it, you won't regret buying it. 

It's not the easiest sim to use. I mean if they could include an FFB clipping meter it would be great. I've heard the odd story of people even struggling to get it to see their wheel. Then there were some issues with the recent AMD driver, which I believe are resolved now. You also have to look to LFM if you want some good online racing. 

But once you are on track there's nothing that can touch it right now. Everyone knows the physics are the best in the business and yeah, it's the most natural driving feel there is. But for me there's also all the other details that make me feel like I am at the track in real life.
- being able to start in the paddock and drive to pit exit is very immersive. It's not even modelled in other sims.
- at pit exit there is a marshal who will warn of oncoming cars. If you leave pits under red flag you will get a stop and go.
- yellow flags work as they should. There are also the actual marshal lighting boards at the marshal posts, just like in real life. So you don't need a HUD element to tell you what flag is out. 
- the track decorations in general are the best in the business. Even rolling through the pits you see the garages and tools you would see on a race weekend. 
- the weather is also best in the business. I mean some sims (AC and iRacing) don't even have weather. But it is implemented well in rF2 and day-night transitions are smooth.
- the contact system works realistically (not overblown or too forgiving) and the netcode is stable enough to not cause random collisions. 

I've had rF2 for years but never played it all that much. I'd love driving in the sim but was never that entertained driving offline. LFM changed this for me and made me give it another go. Adding top notch online to the best sim makes for a winning combo and is what the sim was missing. I also found that they've been quietly improving it all this time too. With a heap of new content out recently and player numbers growing by the day. It's enough to convince a 10 year iRacing member to let his sub lapse and focus on rF2 and ACC in LFM instead.

It's old now, the visuals are outdated, the UI while better than it used to be is still quite obtuse for the casual or new player. But if you want an actual simulation, in my opinion nothing even comes close. The Core gameplay, physics, Force Feedback, tire model is all still leagues ahead of anything else out there. Honestly, I can spend more time hotlapping 1 track with 1 car than I can in  entire other sims. In iRacing or Assetto corsa, you hit a point where you feel like you've perfected it. Every lap, you can do the same inputs, and get the same results. And it does feel like you can kind of cheat the physics engine to get results you wouldn't in real life. RF2 on the other hand just feels dynamic at all times. No lap is exactly like another, every car feels different, every moment engaging. Even the way the clutch and manual transmissions work feels extremely real compared to other sims, with the only limitation being your hardware. This is the only sim that gives me the itch to buy a better wheel, better pedals, a more elaborate rig etc. Like real life, you can spend 1000 hours and still have a TON of room for improvement. And even then, you probably won't be the fastest person. RF2 can separate the boys from men, and the amateurs from the pros

Pros: Best physics and FFB of any sim
Great AI
Great tire model
Dynamic weather that actually transforms the handling
Absolute immersion


Cons: I REALLY wish they had more first party street cars. I'd really love to experience more regular cars with this excellent physics engine, and most mods are not at the same level as the first party content. I'd love to be able to drive my civic Si, or a BRZ, or a Mustang. Normal cars I can drive in real life, not just race cars I'll never step foot in IRL
Mod community not as good as other sims
Graphics and UI extremely outdated
Hard to find online races outside of leagues

Still, blemishes and all, there is no sim out there that feels like I am ACTUALLY learning and improving my real life driving like RF2 does.

The cars, the physics, and the customization options are equal to no other game in this genre, but this is also probably the most poorly put together game I've ever seen as well. Nothing works as it should because of poor coding. Want to add parc ferme rules in a league? The options are there, but don't work properly due to outdated and redundant code. Want the AI to use fixed setups like in rF1 because your tired of seeing them pit on the last lap for no reason? Can't since fixed setups only work for a few things, fuel and pit strategy not one of them. 

There are so many issues that I can't come close to listing them all. Most of the settings you change to personalize the game are in text documents outside of the game which is absolutely dated and convoluted. Once you get past that and understand how to fine tune the settings, you will notice many of them aren't in use and are redundant. There is coding in place for experience gain, money gain, unlocking cars, and a basic progression system as well as championship settings that all do absolutely nothing. There's even more coding left in the files from rF1 that aren't in use anymore as well. This game is an absolute convoluted mess.

Granted, the developers are working on a UI Overhaul which rewrites most of the code so I'm curious to see what will come of that, but I doubt they have the ability to address most of the issues that has plagued this game for almost a decade. I'm rooting for Studio 397 as this really is a great driving sim, but until this game gets fixed, I can't recommend it in it's current state.

Motorsport games, a fraudulent company owned by scammers, is ruining sim racing. Tricking investors and taking the money for themselves. They're constantly out of money and in need of more investors, despite the ceo somehow earning millions in cash. 

With rFactor 2, they're buying up licenses from series that somehow haven't connected any of the dots, except from BTCC, that's why that game never got finished. Now they've scooped up IndyCar. Le mans was already a huge blow, and it's scary to think a company can come along and just buy up series from other platforms. What's going on with the IndyCar game is just a load of nothing after delays and delays.

This specific game is old, outdated, and doesn't even have the capabilities to run events they've taken from another platform.

Studio 397 needs to re-evaluate their situation, leave Motorsport Games, fix their game, and release all of their exclusivity deals, because that's not healthy for sim racing and besides, they cant even run them anyway, while another platform can run multiple splits at the same time with even greater participants.

This means you end up buying a huge number of cars, even if you are not interested in them, only to then struggle to find races to participate in with anyone in them because not everyone has bought every single car required.

When you try to install them it say that you can't, as you don't have the base car or track the mod is for. In a week of looking I found three rooms I could join, one of them even had other players in it. I could go to a room with robot drivers but why would anyone want that? It's bad enough with stupid human drivers, but 'bots REALLY can't learn from their mistakes.... I have driven tons of cars IRL, and have done VR racing for twenty years, and this interface sucks more than any I have ever seen before. From the lobby they tell you the track name, but not the version, and there is not a clue as to what the cars are until you join. WTH? There's a perfect spot to put all of this info, but that area is wasted with a repeat of all of the info in the main view, but no other info. Why bother repeating the insufficient information, on the same page? Why not have a no mods setting? If it only displayed the games I can play, like it promises with the ""owned cars"" setting? If I don't have the base car, or track, then why does it show me the race at all? I just wish I could tell which games I can join without waiting five minutes to find out I can't join anyway. Feel is very good, almost realistic even though it still suffers from squirm, but it is only marginally better than anything else. Not worth the trouble of finding a room that works. 3/10 overall. 7/10 for feel. If real cars were that hard to drive, then most people would not have the skills needed to drive at all.

The included tracks are pretty old and look mostly like garbage. All new content is relatively expensive given the base price of the sim as well as the uselessness of most of the original content (at least for me, I don't care that much about driving a 40 year old car around a bad looking circuit I don't care about).

Now the positive: Once you get everything dialed in, it's from my perspective the most complete and best feeling Sim I have driven. Some how it feels more realistic to me than Iracing. The updated content looks great to fantastic and once you have had a complete race with safety car, weather changes a well dialed in car where Crew Chief gives you perfect updates, it's an absolute blast I never want to miss.

Summary: I don't have enough time to prepare and schedule for online racing like I love do with Iracing once upon a time. I was looking for something I can just throw up and have fun that doesn't feel as arcade as something like F1'22 while still provides diversity in the experience, weather and chaos to mix things up. So for at least single play with AI behaving like idiots in a lobby (in a positive and fun way) I love this. I am yet to try online but will see how that goes at a later point.

I've been trying so hard to like RF2 and make it my main sim, but there are a lot of ""essentials"" missing... I mean very basic stuff that every gamer has access to in 95% of the Racing Simulators these days. 

Set Up:
Nightmare! Absolute nightmare. I'm a casual player, but I've been trying to set this thing up for almost 10 days now and barely it's at where I want it to be in terms of picture quality and stability. 

I have a decent gear. I run ACC, Dirt Rally 2.0, AC, F1 2020, American/Euro Truck Simulator... All in 4K with zero FPS drop, but RF2 needs a lot of babysitting. You basically need to spend more time on performance setup than playing, you'll eventually get there (based on your system), but it'll make you almost cry before it starts rolling smoothly.

In Game Features:
It's a joke! The overlay is so 1999. I have no interest in adding mods from SimHub n stuff to an existing game. I believe mods ruin performance and I hate downloading bunch of stuff on my PC. You need a clean game that delivers basic needs and info for a race. RF2 developer's really let us down when it comes to delivering those features. 

No maps, no FFB bar, no Time Attack, Hot Lap... Not a single car with a proper Dash! or Pit info!! No car specifications in the main menu.

The only amazing thing about RF2 is the FFB and physics. The cars handling are amazing and FFB is the best I've tried in any sim so far. That's exactly why I'm pissed off. Why don't you invest more time to make it perfect when you have the resources and the fan base? Why not take care of the poor in game overlays, poor performance and the basic info to make RF2 shine like a super star? 

I only got the base game and the new 992 to get my feet wet and there's no way I drop a penny on the packs or even a single car with this situation until I see a major change. 

Studio 397 needs to get out of it's comfort zone and take 100's of complaints flying around the internet seriously.

It's worth it for $15.99, but I wouldn't drop 100's of dollars blindly on this thing if I were you

Update:
Motorsport Games have taken an actively hostile approach to the entire Simracing community. Therefore I can not recommend anything they are involved in.
They have used licensing to put bans on some of the biggest and most popular community events that have thousands of drivers participate every year, and replaced it with a single-split invite-only esport event that noone asked for.
First they killed the classic LeMans 24 hours event and mad it illegal for any one but them to arange it or even make an event simmilar to it.

Other games are no longer even allowed to make races that use the same tracks as the irl indycar series and you are not allowed to broadcast using the current or past indycars.

- The ui is still terrible

-the good content is dlc that sometimes costs even more then the base game itself

The ability to adjust the game at your own discretion makes it even better. 

LFM also offers several races every day, alternating weekly. Above all, the community and the behaviour I experience here on the track is the fairest and most reasonable of all.

The way that you can feel the tire skip across the tarmac when loosing traction is phenomenal. The amount of detail sent through my wheel gives great feedback of the tire deforming and moving around on the limit making many types of cars feel very lively. Its so easy to just get lost into lapping around my favorite tracks to get the most out of the car. 

Tire management actually works, tires don't just burn up with one slide. Tire pressures, compounds, and degradation actually matters when racing online or offline. Wet tires work well with fantastic rain dynamics. when tires do overheat it effects lap times but backing off slightly for a lap you can cool them down to keep pushing. 

Car physics for me is obviously next on the list, its not perfect and to be honest I don't know how to explain this properly but I really like how this sim feels against Assetto corsa or iRacing. The way the car goes over the curbs and loads up into corners feels great. I get a good understanding to the weight of the car.

The base content cars are not very good but all DLC cars that I have driven for LFM or league races drive better than any other sim on the market.
DLC for this game is very good quality, tracks are iRacing quality and graphically better, cars look and drive very well but in all honesty I would not have bought any if it wasn't for Low Fuel Motorsport but I do not regret it, the racing online has been great fun. 

The UI and setup seems to be everyone's main complaint but its really not bad at all. I agree its probably the weakest link but after one popper session with the game I could easily find my way around everything. guess I'm used to modding sim racing titles so take my words with a grain of salt. Also this is a simulation not an arcade game.

I tried it before and it was confusing and I just did not get it. Well now I get it. I have had a few months of training in the other sims and some system upgrades, it is an AMAZING racing experience that is NOT for the casual racer. 

I run a Reverb G2 and a sim rig with Fanatec Gear and bass shakers. I was racing the McLaren MP/4-8 around Spa and it was just the perfect amount of intense. AI to 95% and medium aggression those jerks will punt you off of the track, but in a realistic way? It is hard to describe. 

Speaking of the Mad McLaren lets talk about the tire model. The MP/4-8 in my opinion is the perfection of the ""engine, frame and tire"" school of design just before pursuit of downforce started to turn Formula cars into ground based ""fighter jets."" I mean that is AWESOME, but when you drive the MP4, you are really riding the edge of the grip and the tiny downforce will not help in the corners. With my CSL-DD, I feel all of the slip and grip in the tires. It is that simple. 

VR just works for me, but I also have a well tuned VR setup with low frame times and headroom.

So when you have tried the others, learned what racing flags mean, track rules, what a pit limiter is, and lots of other racing trivia, give this a go. You need to set all of your control buttons.

It has seen many ups and downs, it started off being okay - then good - then bad - then good again, but now its amazing! Especially now LFM and Racelabs support it the online experience is fantastic! My only complaints are that the FFB is hard to set up, it takes time to set up the game in general and the UI is POOR! So if RF2 spend time in fixing these issues it would be a hot contender to Iracing.

RFACTOR2s driving experience is unmatched, the feel, the ffb, the realism it is all spot on and that is backed up by professional racing teams using the SIM to train their drivers. Have a quick google and you will find many top teams use RF2 not acc, ams, or iracing and that is because RF2 has the best physics and realism.

The only thing that is letting it down at the moment is;
Base content is non existent

Official released content is great quality but not that much of it at the moment

Mods are great but when one mod is causing crashes the SIM cant tell you which one it is so if you have 100s of mods installed like I do it is time consuming to figure out which mod is crashing the sim

UI is terrible

The fact that you have to own all the cars on a server to join, rather than just owning the one you want to drive is quite frustrating. Let's say there is a server which runs GT3 cars. I bought the GT3 pack before they added the M4 GT3 so I have to pay 5 euro for the single car I don't even care to drive just to join the server. 

Edit:
Now 5 euro on its own isn't a lot of money especially in sim racing, but when the GT3 pack costs as much as ACC and you have to buy single cars like this it can get very expensive.

Is organized in years, feel free to go down and see 2022 if you like, or suffer with me year to year , lol.

------------------------------------------------------
Some 2017 ago:


Amazing physics, slightly ahead of ams (automobilista), great AI,.. the best actual driving sim (on physics and ffb, not on multiplayer experience neither grahics) . better than ac iracing r3e etcetc in the aspects mentioned.

Lately is developing in slow motion and in a iracing marketing style and its difficult to say if it will have a bright future.

Critical points are multiplayer and UI, we have been waiting several years ...

These days your safe move would be to buy AC , AMS2 or ACC ...but on physics and ffb is still the king!


The Last trend of rf2 , sadly, is a sort of  iracinglike business selling you  for 5 eur each car they develop and 10-20 eur the track...so it is up to you if you love or hate this bussiness tendencies of Studio 397. 
-------------------------------------------

# March 2021 Update: 

- Multiplayer is improving but still not Safety neither skill ratings for the races. They offer dayly races and thats a great step ahead.
Sometimes i think that they have implemented this aspect to make you buy all the content because if the Series is about 5 tracks and 2 cars and you dont own one track or 1 car you can NOT register to the 3 weeks series...,come on Studio 397!

- Loading times must be improved and the UI needs an update appart that not allways is very intuitive...

- On forcefeedback is still ahead of every sim still in 2021, better than ACC and AMS2 , nothing has changed.

- If you are starting on simracing i would recomend you easier overall options as AC, ACC or AMS2.

---------------------------------------------
UPDATE End of October 2022:


Still s397 is improving the multiplayer and creating the competition.
No news about some rating iracinglike (Safety Rating and Speed Rating).

UI has imporved a lot but some base issues are still present, like charging times at the begining or some official mods skins (official content from isi or some dlc like reiza cars) not appearing, lol.

Prices still so expensive for what they offer...

This sim probably at this stage is only for people that love their ffb and physics , that probably are the best with no comparison (neither ams2 neither acc neither iracing), but some issues are some years arround and they dont show eagerness to solve them? 
And after Motorsports company bying the Studio397 no big changes on the real issues have been noticed. So time to wait soime more years? I hope only months please, i am getting older and this review is getting a bit biblical!

Its a bit shameful that they dont work more efficiently after so many years, they could beat the others in numbers but they are soooo lazy and unresponsive that they are losing grip.

PD: So sad that lowfuelmotorsports.com (a free simracing platform webbased ) are using thuis sim alonside acc and are getting better results in multiplayer numbers than the rfactor 2 company , big LOL.",1502211563,1666722451,True,8,0,0.57572251558303833,0,True,False,False

+ The best ffb in any game
+ Very good car physics
+ Full course yellow with safety car
+ Fantastic feeling with the cars and car control (even though they can be a bit like AMS2 on track)
+ Rain, rain and rain
+ Night races
+ AI fights and crashes too (but there is also a negative)
+ Seems to be well optimized
+ Damage model is great
+ Fuel and tires is a thing
+ MOD support (There are mods, tracks and cars)

- Menu UI is  outdated but decent
- AI seems a bit in a track on the racing line
- Cars can look a bit floating above the track
- Graphics could be better
- In car LOD could be better
On mine at least there is a lot of brightness and a lot of contrast, making some cars and tracks look like garbage. but others looks great, look into re-shade.

If you like racing simulators this is definetely worth it.
Now there is also LFM support (in beta) but that brings multiplayer into the mix.

Expensive, yes. Every instance, when I want to defect to other racing sim, I find myself returning to rFactor2 for its brilliant physics, the road feel, the feel of rubber, clear handling and the laundry list of smaller neatly implemented features that make rFactor2 #1 racing sim.

One may criticise rFactor2 for lack of important multiplayer features like those iRacing has — those points are warranted, it is difficult to argue, but this game remains the most realistic and true-to-life racing simulator, at least for racing on tarmac. For rally fans Warthog's Richard Burns Rally from 2004 is still the undisputable king, even in FFB department. In rFactor 2 force feedback, the Road 2.0 simulation, lazer-scanned tracks and sophisticated tire simulation running at 2400 Hz raise the game above the original Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, GTR, GT Legends, Race07, RRRE, Automobilista 1, 2 and iRacing. Only BeamNG Drive can compete in realism department with a caveat of being a completely different type of car game. FYI, BeamNG Drive is not a racing game, rather a sandbox, which rFactor2 is not.

I loved the original rFactor with its multitude of road car mods, I love the successing rFactor2 with its strictly racing pedigree and hope for further development. Sadly, given what is happening right now with Motorsport Games, it seems like we will never see the rFactor3 in the future. The original developer ISI has sold the game to Studio 397 a while ago and while Studio 397 does brilliant job at improving upon the original, they will have no will, no money, no opportunities to develop completely new game from scratch on a new graphical engine. By now rFactor2 is relatively old game and it's already lacking in graphics department.

- You can buy the same car 2 times by mistake.
- If you buy some car, and then later you decide to buy a car pack that includes the same car, they don't apply any discount and you pay the full price of the pack.

Things must be done in my opinion:

- Remove the DLCs you own from the buying list, so you can't buy the same DLC twice. 
- Develop a more friendly user DLC managing system.
- Apply discounts when you own a track or a car from a pack.
- Pay more attention to oval racing in the competitive system.

It boasts a loyal fanbase, an in-depth physics engine with stellar force feedback, and a thriving modding community. However, does all this make it a worthwhile pick up in 2022? After all, the game is now nine years old. Join ChampionJoe as he gives his honest, and perhaps surprising, review of rFactor 2.

What makes a Good Sim a Good Game?

Recently, rFactor 2 received a significant update which improve the interface and in-game menus. Confusing, ugly and cluttered menus that used to be a feature of the game are all gone now, and the sleek redesign works wonders for the game’s overall usability. So this new aspect of the game get’s Joe’s thumbs up.

Obviously, the driving itself is very high quality – the game isn’t considered to be one of the best simulations on the market for no reason! However, is it enough for a sim racing game to simply have the best physics and force feedback systems?

Where the game excels in driving feel, it lacks in driving content. The total absence of any sort of a career mode or custom championships in singleplayer can lead to a somewhat empty experience. For those who just love to drive, this isn’t a big issue, but for those who crave competition it is certainly a drawback. When it comes to multiplayer things aren’t much better. There are no safety or skill ratings, and anyone can enter any race, provided they have the necessary DLC for it!

With the new UI one of the major issues with the sim was solved. How to make it more than a hotlapping simulator is another question. I like the driving, but I think the hope for this game has to lie in the competition system. They either need to provide a valid alternative to iRacing or drastically improve the AI. Even if they do improve the AI it still doesn’t have any type of championship or career feature built in. If you own the game already it might be worth trying out the competition system. If not, the question is how much a seasons type of online competition system is worth without a ranking or safety system attached to a driver across series. If they can add that I think it does have a shot to be a much more worthwhile game than it is now.

If you’re into sim racing and wanted to get as close to the real thing as possible then rFactor 2 is definitely worth it.

The simulator is extremely realistic and offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to modding.

In addition to that, there’s a massive modding community for rFactor 2 so you’ll never run out of things to do.",1620302008,1660702752,True,2,0,0.51394420862197876,0,True,False,False

After playing RF2 and AC this sim has become my go to if for no other reason than it being an absolute joy to drive. Let alone the variety of weather and track conditions and the recent real road update being great perks, this is the sim where I truly feel like I am driving the car as the ffb is excellent. The inclusion of indycar and most of the cars in the IMSA weathertech series (specifically the DPi, Oreca LMP2 and Liger LMP3) leave less to be desired compared to other platforms, especially on the sportscar side, and if you know where to look you can find most if not all of the tracks on the imsa and indycar schedules. 

This is not to say RF2 does not have its drawbacks. Of course there is no official stock car, the ai certainly makes some interesting decisions, the quality of mod tracks can be a crapshoot (although some are truly excellent) the graphics while sufficient could be better in 2022, and of course there is the elephant in the room that we have no idea what will happen to this game and parent company in the next few months or if it will even be here in 2023.

You could play online, but it's gonna cost you, since you have to buy entire overpriced car packs even if you only want to drive one car.

The driving itself is nice, which may have been a good selling point five years ago, but at this point there are plenty of sims that can offer that and more.

That is not the case - as the product has no classes (i.e Amateur, Professional or Levels like Lvl 1-100), no progression (you don't unlock any cars, they're all available for you to play) nor any modifications (ONLY TUNES). 

What this product is, is a tool, a tool used to test out real cars from real racing teams in order to estimate a cars performance without going through real-life testing, which is very costly. This software provides accurate levels of detail from real world data which is used to simulate a car and the track it is driven on - thus providing a very cheap substitute to real life testing. Of course for more accurate details, teams go for rFpro, but since most of us are commercial consumers, this is as close as it gets. 

rFactor 2 is best enjoyed by those who simply want to test out vehicles and their performances - yes there is multiplayer and AI, but think of them as simply variables and not opponents, they affect the road temperature which affects the levels of grip around parts of a track which affects your grip and overall performance. Sure in league racing which focuses on multiplayer entirely, then treat the software like iRacing - just with more ""push-it-to-the-limits"" styles of driving and a less strict penalty system. But when it comes to singleplayer with the AI, its all about testing a cars performance based on the tuning side of things, and that's as far as it goes. Sure, one can practice racing lines and etiquette, but for etiquette or strategies, iRacing would be the best option.

So, if you are looking for a game to play with friends, battling it out with pros and whatnot, look somewhere else as this game hardly provides the former, and sometimes - if you know where to look - the latter. 
If you are however looking for a software to test out any vehicles performance, be it on a tarmac track or rarely on dirt, then this is it.

Think of this game as Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 - that should give you a good perspective relative to the other racing sims out there.",1658621577,1658621577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a big fan of racing sims - the F1 series, Assetto Corsa, etc. After reading that even though the game was older it 'supposedly' has been updated. Was surprised when I saw the download was 1.8 gb. Man, that is some tight coding. Well... I just said ""enough, give me my money back"". Why?

1. Opened the game and NO CONTENT. No cars, no tracks. How are you supposed to race with no cars or tracks? Spent a few hours trying to find out where the content was. Steam? No help. Studio 397? They said it was Steam's fault, that they must have changed something. 

2. After a time consuming search of threads, forums etc, found one discussion on here that said you had to go to the Steam workshop and 'follow' one of the mods. ??? Who sells a sim that you can't play after downloading? Into the workshop and 'followed' (whatever the heck that means) the first thing in the list. Thought to myself ""are they going to charge me for this?"" After I 'followed' it began downloading all the missing cars and tracks. Ok, here we go... Nope.

3. Unplayable with a controller. What? Opened the game and there was all the missing content. Ok! Let's race! Set the game up for an Xbox controller. Went through button assignments and calibration, set up race conditions, picked car and track and hit the track. Oh... my... gawd. Totally unable to steer the car. Any movement on the stick was lock to lock. Spent more time adjusting the controller to try to find a setting that would allow me to STEER. Finally at 10% steering sensitivity and still unable to have any kind of racing control. The game also would ""forget"" the settings that you just spent way too  time setting up. I would start practice, be in the car in the garage, hit the gas and... nothing. Back out into settings and the trigger assignment for throttle would be gone. Reassign right trigger to throttle, start again and... are you kidding me. The game sometimes would see the throttle in the config screen. Squeeze trigger and would indicate 0 to 100%. Back to track and... nada. I did get on the track at the beginning of this saga a number of times until the game just stopped responding to throttle input.

I rarely write a review but this was so much a waste of time. As you can see officially have 3.5 hours of game play. Nope. 3.5 hours of frustration starting, restarting, calibrating... not to mention the embarrassing amount of time I searched for a solution.

Really wanted to enjoy this title. I've surrendered, got my refund and regrettably uninstalled.

The UI is not THAT bad... I think it may be worst for older users which got the previous version and can now compare. At the beginning is awkward, and it took some time to install everything, but all automatic. Ready to play in 20-30 minutes more or less. 
Loading time for a track is big in todays standards, but less for custom content which seems to be smaller then official items (tracks).
In no time I had custom content, a lot more tracks and cars. Very easy to add them (the easiest is to subscribe on steamworks, restart, it's done).

After 80 hours, I can definitely say that this is the best driving experience amongst all racing sims. I did not even knew my wheel T300rs was so good!

Pros:
1. Great physics (feels as though you have full control of the car, IF you disable all assists)
2. Decent visuals for 2021
3. Variety of tracks (fictional and otherwise)
4. Variety of different cars (DOWNLOAD - honestly takes about 1/2hr depending on your rig)
5. Smart AI 
6. SICK crash visuals
7. FFB - cannot be understated at all - I drive with what would be considered an ""old/weak wheel - G920) and although AC and AMS2 also have decent FFB - they dont rival the FFB in the high speed corners. Feels natural and right (having never driven any of these cars in RL)

Cons:
1. Visual bugs every now and again - wont lie, that is a major bummer
2. Tracks are not laser scanned but still done very well. 
3. U/I  - not the friendliest but CMON, some folks make it seem like they are navigating a NASA interface..

GREAT representation of track and road racing IMHO - I for one, cant get enough. Its no wonder moving forward that all future RACING SIMS will use the RFACTOR 2 physics engine. It is as close as ill ever get to piloting a 1100HP BEAST around Donnington.

Extra FYI's: 
 - I have noticed any major bugs, just graphic artifacting here and there but almost unnoticeable.
 - rFactor 2's pricing depends on what experience you are expecting the game to offer, personally I would 
   wait for some sales since the game is kind of expensive and I'm only in it for the endurance racing 
   experience. 
 - (Controller users overview on the support) So far the controller support is decent but can be quite  
    convoluted and I just hope that this game get game controller rumbling support for those that can't afford 
    wheels. Keep in mind when using controller make sure you Enable Steam Input in Factor 2 properties. Also 
    make sure to set up your controller in game. Keybinds, sensitivity just fixing to your liking since the default 
    settings aren't so great. You can get a good experience from a pad and I think it deserves some justice.",1654589665,1654589665,True,0,0,0.483271360397338867,0,True,False,False

It took some time to figure out how it works (the interface is far from intuitive), but now that I have, I really like it.

• I would say that it's actually the best looking one of the ones listed above, and does quite well performance wise relative to the other sims. It doesn't have the fanciest graphics, but they're nice and crisp (even on my Valve Index). For example, ACC has more detailed graphics, but it runs way worse than rF2 in terms of frame rate. In VR, I'd much rather take crisp graphics than detailed but blurry graphics. Overall, I'd say the graphics are similar to Assetto Corsa... but the graphics in rF2 just appear a bit crisper and more modern (I can't quite put my finger on why).

• It has a good level of customization and modability. You can add cars and tracks, and things like HUDs (which is good, since the built-in HUD is not very good). That said, it doesn't compare to the amount and variety of content available for Assetto Corsa. And although some of the add-ons are free, the official ones are on the expensive side (many of the add-ons cost more than what I paid for any of the other sims mentioned above, including some of their add-on content).

• I'm new to sim racing, so it's hard for me to say how realistic the handling of the cars is, but what I can say is they feel very good compared to the other sims I've tried, including in the force feedback department (all of the others are pretty good, with the exception of Project Cars 2, which definitely lags behind the others).

• Both hot lapping and racing against the AI is fun (at least for a novice like me). However, I really wish this had a campaign mode similar to what Project Cars 2 has. I'm not an online racing kind of person (at least not so far), so single player modes are very important to me.

I can feel every bump, slide, and traction on the road with precision. I went from skating on thin ice with iRacing, to what I thought was the best FFB I have ever felt on ACC to now rFactor2 that blew my mind away. I can catch every oversteer moment and confidently go for the fastest lap. As a comparison, I bought the Spa track content and tried for the fastest lap time on rFactor2 with the Porsche GT3R and within 5 laps, I was doing within 0.4s of my fastest time on ACC. And this is without any setup tinkering. Nothing. Just pure driving. I am sure I can post my fastest lap time on Spa if I were to modify the setup and practice more on the track. That's how realistic and how good the physics and FFB system is on rFactor2.
rFactor 2 is not without its cons. They are mainly the graphics, the sound, the multiplayer system, and basically the whole GUI.

Prior to buying rFactor 2 I was kind of sceptic due to the large amount of comments saying its simply a game engine.

rFactor 2 is indeed only a engine - but no worries, the base game DOES come with content - it just gets delivered in a very weird way, via Steam Workshop.
When first installing the game, and launching it, it doesn't always install the game content; A way to force the game to automatically install it all, is by going to rFactor 2's Workshop, and subscribing to whatever in there (Doesnt matter what), and then booting up your game again.
[b]This should trigger the install of all rFactor 2 base content.[/b]

GAME REVIEW:
I find rFactor to be one of the best simulation-racing games I have yet played, it equals the other simulation-racing titles out there; So if you have a wheel and pedals, and love zooming in high end racing cars, then this game is for you.
Graphics are superb, vehicle physics is off the hook, and the ability to run 24 hour races with driver swaps is -insane-.

The game is best played with friends, or alone; Public servers are a mess, and if you don't have -ALL- dlc content, finding servers to play on can be a battle.
Setting up a server is A PAIN compared to - ANY other game out there.. It has one of the worst systems I have ever seen, and it will defo. require some technical skills if you want a server up and running.

A cheat sheet for those trying with a server;
-- Close down Steam before you launch the dedicated server- this way you can still start rfactor while hosting.
-- 9/10 wont be able to find their own server via ingame launcher, use the +connect 192.168.x.x param to direct-join your server. (Obviously external IP for friends)
-- Gather all installed packages in a MOD to actually run the packages.


TLDR;
Really, really good game, has its small quirks, but works pretty good out of the box. Advanced in terms of server hosting.

Realism: it feels very good to me even though im no expert on the matter.

Immersion: very very good, as long as i can pick the right car and track.

Modding:  there is a lot going on which is good, but can also be a game killer. For the moment, it's all good i would say. Btw, i'm a fan of the f1 1991 mod.

Multiplayer: after the golden years of RF1, i was hoping for loads of online servers with actual people in them. This is not the same, but there are certainly evenings where there are several servers to choose from.

Sound: it all depends on the mod, your soundcard and such. Some mods have great sound, some are just not up to par.

Graphics: I use an RX570 videocard combined with an i5 and 32GB ram. This sim runs like a charm in all cases ive seen so far. I easily hit 100fps with graphic settings set to very high at 2560x1440. My monitor is an Asus mg279q.

Great sim. There is a lot of free quality mods. The cars handles beautifully, the game keeps improving. You can get paid dlc during steam sales. Graphics are ok.

 THE GAME IS GREAT BUT THE INTERFACE NOT SO MUCH.
Whether I will be able to drive each day is a bit like lottery. Plus when the game ends, it stays as if still runing, thus preventing you from opening any other stem app. You need to kill it in the services and if you are playing in VR in single screen, you have to restart you PC.

I was amazed when playing at automobilista 2 as an early backer, quick loading times and flawless executions. Rfactor 2 has been here for a while but is still unpolished, buggy even if they keep talking of the new UI.

You can see the corner(s) !  Even has built in Head movement (more is better ).

Better than AMS 1, since you can actually drive most cars without spinning out on every corner (but there are still some that do), or that nasty uphill corner that no car survives (boo!).  AMS1 really bad on assigning buttons and KB keys.  Kinda of important - next to the driving anyway.

Free DLC is nice for sure, I was worried I was inn for the iRacing model, although Im not familiar with the new ? process of SUBSCRIBING to a feature on Steam then the STEAM module downloads all new modules when you open in subsequent RF2 session.

Still RF2 is similar to AMS 1 with no search sort or lookup button / key assignments !  arrghhh WHY !

It's OK, and has potential, but needs work to compete and stay relevant with the newer sim titles available in the market. I own and play: AC, ACC, PC1, PC2, AMS2 and this one. 

What stood out for me: 

1/ Graphics engine and visuals seems a little dated but is acceptable but the game requires more optimisation to run smoother for a racing sim as it can have frame rate drops. Something the other titles don't suffer from with similar settings.

2/ Onboard camera view needs more development work to allow a high FOV and seat position to work with a 43inch monitor up near the steering wheel and player so as to get a sense of speed and the dash scaling needs improvement to match some realism on how a monitor would represent a drivers view in RL.

3/ Opponent car sounds are too loud when inside the menu screens and there seems to be no option to turn its volume down or muted.

4/ Wheel FFB settings seem to not have delete a saved profile option nor a config reset to original default settings option that works. My FFB wheel detection became buggy for me personally using a Fanatec CSW2.5 wheel after I saved a custom profile. I was unable to get the games CSW2.5 default setting to detect my wheel again. It's weird and a major bummer.

I have noticed that some work has gone into this game since I first bought and played this game, and it seems that it is still getting developer improvements for its age, and fortunately, has not been abandoned. This is a good sign to not write this one off yet as the game itself has a good selection of non-DLC cars and shows potential to be a serious and refined racing simulator. It may potentially be a good one to have in a collection later down the track.

- Why do you have DLCs as ingame items ?

- Why do you have DLC pictures on the steam store front, and then have the DLC hidden behind the items paywall ?

- Why does the game unpack and reinstall the workshop items despite having them subscribed and already downloaded ?

- Why do I need to buy the same content again if I am purchasing a pack and it already includes items that I already own ?

- Why does the game re-installs most workshop items the moment I boot up the game ? I know it is probably because those workshop items got updated but the way this game manages the workshop items is absolutely disgusting. Straight up spoils the mood once you are stuck on the loading screen waiting for the stupid workshop item to get updated.

- Why can't I visit the workshop page of the DLCs that I've bought ? 

- Why do the textures on most DLC cars look low resolution despite running the game on ultra ? FE car liveries look horrible in the T-Cam. No, it is not just on my computer, I've seen it all over the place. 

- When will you update the old DX9 (released by S397) content in the workshop ? Most tracks and cars previously made by S397 are still DX9. When will you update them ? I guess it's much more profitable to make new DLC than fix the older items that you've released on the workshop for free.

- When will you folks start pricing your products appropriately ? Literally every sim out there has regional pricing done right, except for this game. Learn from Kunos, or Reiza.

- The DLCs are overpriced when you compare it with other sims. On top of that, the DLCs aren't that good either. The cockpits look horrible, the dash looks out of place, the sounds aren't good. They feel like mods at best. 

- Why are there no Championships or a robust and easy tool to create one?

- Why is it so hard to set up a server and race with friends ?

- Why is there no appropriate MP rating system, let alone, a proper MP system ?

- When will you introduce true to life fonts for the dashboards/LCDs of different cars ? Literally every other car uses the same font which doesn't even look realistic. 

- When will you improve the cockpits of every vehicle that you've released to date ? They look ugly and most of the texture work is downright atrocious.

- Why do most of these paid cars sound trash ? Considering the price that you pay for the DLCs, I'd atleast expect them to have a decent presentation.

- When is the AI getting an update ? Not everyone has the time to let the AI run practice and quali to ""learn the track"". AI on the newly released DLC tracks still suck and is broken.

- When are you folks updating the abysmal HUD that we have in the game ?

- Why is the replay system as janky as it is ?

- Why are the loading times still abysmal ? 

- Why is it so difficult to select the opponents that I want to race against ?

- The support for this sim is absolutely trash. S397 doesn't really care much about their userbase and won't every respond to your queries or problems. 


At this point these developers are just taking advantage of the fact that the tyre model in rF2 is far more superior to any other sim out there. In 2022, I can confidently say that rF2 is still as broken than it was ever before. The only good thing to have happened in the last few years, was the the UI was brought upto the standards but it still sucks.They fix one thing, and a plethora of other bugs/glitches/memory leaks pop up, and then they take another 6 months to fix those.

New updates are being released, but majority of the new features like updated cockpit sounds and such are only being released for the paid content first (that too selected). New updates like these break the mods that are already in the workshop which is a big insult to the creators and the users who use them. 

Luckily, in 2022, we have sims like AMS2, ACC, AC.",1612004848,1651077932,False,2,0,0.528495252132415771,0,True,False,False

They promptly decided in September 2021 to take this absolutely perfect game and murder it by releasing the UNFINISHED ui as a forced update, and then hastily putting together a 3rd ui update that only and exclusively changes in appearance and fixes none of the problems introduced with the 2nd ui update.

So, here's what changed:

>If you're using any wheel or controller that isn't officially supported, you can no longer input more than two analog axis at the same time. This means if you need to change gear, you need to hold the clutch, and RELEASE the gas AND the brake pedals, AND hold the wheel/controller perfectly straight, which is straight up impossible to do if you don't have deadzones.
>If you're using any wheel or controller that isn't officially supported, you can no longer remove steer filtering. This means when you turn left in real life, the ingame wheel will take approximately 3 years to turn left.
>If you change any graphical setting, the resolution will automatically switch to 3840x1620 ultrawide. No one knows why.
>In the controls menu, whenever you press a button, you can no longer see what's bound to it turning red. This was immensely useful to make sure everything worked before starting the race.
>You can no longer preview the HUD in the settings before starting a race.
>Unlike the previous UI, the new UI is stuck in 1080p. If you have a 1440p screen or above, everything will now be blurry and unreadable. Custom UI's are no longer supported. Everytime you click on a button, there's now an excruciatingly long and stuttery animation to load the next screen.
>You can no longer disable practice and qualifying, or decide how long they last, or the wheather, or the hour of the race, or anything else. The menu is there, but no matter if you set everything to 100% rain, it's still sunny, it doesn't work. I'm not fucking kidding.
>You can no longer disable Auto-Subscribe from Launcher.config, because Launcher.config no longer exists. It doesn't matter how many times you press unsubscibe all, rFactor 2 will still automatically subscribe to and download 61 (!!!!!!!!!!) low quality mods from the workshop. I'm not fucking kidding.
>The already abysmal loading times have increased by 400%. I'm not fucking kidding.
>Thanks to the new Corvette patch, you can no longer use the Steam Workshop for user created content, only official content. I'm not fucking kidding.
>It is entirely impossible to complete all achievements in this game. I'm not fucking kidding. (https://steamcommunity.com/app/365960/discussions/0/3055112595735061926/)

#REALISM
Physics and ffb feel really realistic so are the sounds.
Graphics look outdated, which does not disturb me that much in a sim.

#CONTENT
What disappointed me in this game was the base content. 

#CARS
First of all, before buying this game I had no clue which cars and tracks were included.
After the game has downloaded all the content I was really disappointed with what I've seen.
There were 38 cars, sure it is a big number for the base content without dlcs. 

However from 38 cars 19 are formula (f1/f2/f3) type and 2 karts... Which I'm not really into.
And from the remaining 17 only a small subset of cars (4-5 at most) were interesting for me.
The game severely lacks variety when it comes to cars.

Another thing which annoys me is the car list is also flooded with livery.

#TRACKS
What about the tracks? Exactly the same situation, there are 19 tracks in the base content. All of them are GP/GT like tracks which lack variety. At the end only track which I really enjoy driving is Monaco, which is unfortunately just temporary content.

#VALUE
For your money you get a solid but unpolished sim with *meh* base content.
Some DLCs seem ok but I simply refuse to pay 5€ per car and 9€ per track!

If I compare this to Assetto Corsa, although base content is bigger in rf2, Assetto Corsa has more interesting tracks and cars. And AC also has much more fair in DLC pricing and the quality is top notch.

If you are looking for a nice sim with really good content grab a copy of Assetto Corsa.",1548800304,1650657933,False,12,1,0.51184546947479248,0,True,False,False

Cons: I’d just rather plan another sim

Rf2 has slowly been getting better and I’ve been patient with it for over a year, and that’s mostly because how it was touted to be have the most realistic physics and its VR implementation is good. However, I no longer think it has the best physics. They may have the “most advanced tire model” but drive the M4 DTM or Formula Pro and it’s like the cars have zero weight, the wheels struggle to find grip and grass might as well be ice

Rf2 isn’t a bad sim but there’s nothing it does particularly well either. I find it more frustrating than fun.

AI are okay-ish but AI is better in AMS2. Set the AI in rf2 too aggressive aka above 25% and there is a good chance they'll ram into you and end your race. Apparently there is a way to ""train"" the AI  but I feel I shouldn't have to do all that nonsense and I can't confirm that to be true because I've never done it

Hot-lapping is adequate, but again I’d much rather do that in any other sim, AC, ACC, AMS2
Multiplayer - well it's empty, not much going on and if your main reason for buying this game is for multiplayer, I'd look elsewhere e.g. Race Room, ACC or iRacing

Competition system - this is an organised version of the online play and is the current focus for the devs. To participate you will be expected to buy most if not all  of studio 397's DLC content. With just the base game and no DLC you won't be able to join any competition servers. 

Official content is great but mostly paid DLC

I kept rF2 around because of 3 things:
1)	Physics
2)	VR – Rather play AMS2 or the original Assetto Corsa (AC)
3)	Modding - The original AC is king of Mods

If you can only buy one sim, I’d skip rf2
If you have all the other sims and are curious, go for it buy it
If you have AMS2 and/or AC you’re not going to find anything new here
If you want multiplayer I’d get ACC, Raceroom or iRacing",1629993466,1649242650,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

borderline its a good sim. the best one out there in fact.
would say this is far better than iracing, but that dont mean iracing is bad. its just that this is a far more realistic sim in my opinion.

+ insanely detailed in terms of physics. everything (except deformation) is fully simulated. things such as brake temperature, tire wear, tire deformation, tire graining, aerodynamic deformation, performance/mechanical damage, is modeled in rfactor 2
+ good graphic. used to be very bad but its far better now.
+ supports endurance races natively, no need for external mods. this also means the sim has day and night cycle
+ good AI. cannot be compared to forza's drivatar, but it's okay for simulating races
+ good support for competition
+ correct penalty system (isn't too restrictive like AC/ACC but also isn't too liberal like ps1-ps3 gran turismo games)
+ would say it has the best force feedback compared to other sim
+ is able to synchronize to real time and weather system which makes endurance races a lot realistic

- unfriendly for people not using steering wheel
- despite the new UI, it is still arguably much heavier compared to the likes of AC/ACC, GT, and iRacing
- clunky multiplayer mod download system. a lot of time, the auto-download for mp mods is failing and resulted in denied entry to server.
- natively dont have a lot of base car. dlc and expansion packs costs way too much and there aren't a lot of mod compared to AC.
- (edit 1) if your CPU is struggling to draw resources, you will face slow downs. in gameplay, your car will go slow despite on HUD and telemetry it is showing something like 200kph, but because of the CPU slow down your car moves far slower than what is shown on telemetry. this happens on certain CPUs, most likely due to game engine incompatibility with certain CPU, most likely has to do with certain instructions (mine is an Intel i5 10500H)

overall, if you are looking for the most realistic racing sim yet then this is for you (not that other sims aren't realistic enough, however, and if you dont mind the clunky, outdated engine and interface)
this has to be the most sophisticated sim yet to date. the UI, buttons, and assignment may take some time to get used to but once you get used to it, it's really nothing. despite the new UI, new players may get confused to the complexity.

If you want a single player racing game then get Asseto Corsa, amazing graphics and sound is amazing too.
Who knows maybe there is a better sound and graphics experience in multiplayer, guess i will never know as do not wish to play that. maybe someone can enlighten me.
In all fairness i haven't managed to get the setup right to be able to get in a race, as cannot get used to the controller setup, maybe the racing experience is second to none.

AI will brake check, run off the road and spin, and make it hard to justify taking the time to set the grid during practice to see the race get ruined. This was on 40 aggression

Steam refunded me anyway. Thanks for their quick response and understanding.

WHAT THIS GAME REALLY IS - PLEASE READ.

$32 / THE GAME ENGINE - SOLD AS ""THE GAME""
There is nothing in there at all. no car, no circuits, nothing. Just the menus.

$138.32 / DLCs - SOLD AS CONTENT - THE ACTUAL GAME
They are not DLCs but ""Shop Items""... LOL

-----------------------------------

So the total cost is $270. Project CARS or Assetto Corsa have more content for $40 each.

-----------------------------------

250 GBs / FREE CONTENT - WORKSHOP ITEMS
If you can muster downloading at least half of that to start playing, be my guest.
Every bit of content is going to queue to be downloaded.
And then, once you launch the game, they all going to be installed.
THE INSTALLATION OF THE WORKSHOP ITEMS ARE GOING TO COUNT TOWARDS YOUR PLAY TIME. Isn't that nice.
There is not way of telling which Workshop items have dependencies or which ones are obsolete. Even if you discard the items creating errors by manually searching and removing them through your windows file, you will be left with empty car visualization in the car list.

Good Fricking luck if you decide to put up with all this nonsense.

----------------------

Biggest Oof of this entire game is the visuals.
You launch the game, the music is awesome and inspiring, you see in game engine animation of cars and tracks, the menu is simple and easy to use and the stills for each section really tells you how beautiful - yet simple - the graphics are.
No, Neine, Non. It is not.
Launch your first track and witness the horror.
Wait, did you set every graphic enhancement to max like I did? Good.
It does not matter. The graphics are GTR 2 level except wash out in saturated color and ugly bloom. If you start looking closely at the hero pictures you will see how the presentation is a big lie. The engine is from 2008 max and every single visual is a lie. There is no modern post processing in game, no ambient occlusion, no scattering, no global illumination, no direct light or shadows in the cockpit. There is no depth anywhere.

When I first loaded up the game 2 years ago it was like stepping back into the 2000s in terms of presentation, useability and polish- but it has improved radically since then. An online competition system arrived which is free to use, and which needs but also deserves a bigger user base. The graphics have improved a lot. The UI was updated twice, the second time properly. There are constant evolutions to the game and additions to the content, even though Studio 397 is often slow to fix things from little quirks to fairly big bugs. But they are a small development team making big efforts and ultimately providing a product that just drives superbly, and that is what it's ultimately all about.

Feb. 2022 New UI Update.
The new UI is a step in the right direction, but it still feels someway off/wrong.

After installing and loading my few selected Workshop Items, i was forced to download some additional cars, despite disableing auto subscribe.

The updater had some overlapping images. i know nit picky, but as a first impression of the new UI is this a negative point.

The whole package RF2 delivers is still nothing for me.

[strike]UI might me cool 30 years ago.

Having to click 6 times with animations in between to choose a car.
Another 6 times to choose the track with animations.
Another x clicks for the race options and being presented with a approx load time of to much minutes.[/strike]

Using Steam Workshop as the main content delivery is hell.
You end up with ~30GB of installed ""Mods"" and keeping them also in the steam cache. [i]Occupying around 60GB[/i]

Thanks to the Workshop, you are able to remove content you do'nt like.
In theory a nice feature, when you dont have to create a non documented file
[b]steamapps\common\rFactor 2\UserData\Launcher.config[/b] containing [b]Disable Workshop Auto-Subscribe:True[/b]
After removing the mostly open wheeler heavy content i endet up with 2 cars and 2 tracks.
The next upgrade whould be the GT3 and Track Pack + Spa + Monza BADAM 80 bucks more ...
better get for this money
R3E + Premium, lots of great cars and tracks
or ACC if your only into gt3
or AMS 2 is also great mix of everything
or AC or AMS if you have to rely on mods

[strike]I get even tired of writing a review, there ar so much more things that annoy one[/strike]

Maybe when you got to much time and money and want to drive one [i]of few[/i] cars on one of the few tracks.

But for me this title moves to my pile of shame.

like: driving in it.
LOVE: the kart-sim go kart DLC
dislike: they have the most messed up DLC purchase system ever.
Improving!: the game is SLOW - it takes FOREVER to load a map up. This has gotten better with the 2022 UI update
dislike: it even takes a fair bit to get back to the menu after you're done with a race/practice round. (Still valid in 2022)
like: once the map is loaded you can go back to the pits and re-race without reloading.
dislike: you can't pause in game and adjust settings on the fly like you can with other titles.
Like: DLC seems fairly priced, and there isn't too much of it - this isn't iracing.
Like/love/hate: Steam workshop has a bunch of FREE DLC content - this is a blessing (because it's free) and a curse) because it varies in quality.
LOVE: the devs have been working on it and releasing regular updates.


Overall I would recommend this game if it just loaded a bit faster.  Competing titles like Raceroom and Automobilista load faster, which means less time waiting. This isn't a big deal on tiny tracks but larger ones can take 10+ minutes to load. 

If the devs devoted one update cycle to optimizing load times for tracks, that'd switch my opinion to fully recommended.",1630368037,1644284344,True,0,0,0.528497397899627686,1,True,False,False

Not because its the best - There is no such thing - but because I got involved in league racing with it. This for me is the critical factor to enjoy rf2. Either you get involved in some online league racing or you will get bored. Here are the good and the bad in my opinion:

Good:
The cars feel great. FFB is for me the best of all sims I tried. This is the biggest strong point of RF2
Graphics are good with the official content.
Additional official content quality is quite good - Best Nurburgring I have seen...
There are quite a lot of mods available so there is a lot of content.
The AI will race you hard.
The base price is quite acceptable.
The workshop system is efficient.

Bad:
The sounds are not as good as other sims.
Network performance is hit and miss. Been better lately but I have had a 40s freeze and a disconnect online... There is also a bug which gets the race in full course yellow randomly... 
You need a course to setup a server to run a race if you want to do that.
Sometimes the package system messes up and then its a frustrating mess to troubleshoot.
The AI is hard to tune and can be too agressive - When you get put out by the AI in a training session it just feels silly.
The mods quality can be poor. Its community content so some are better than others.
There is not much to do other than racing online or single racing the AI. No hotlaps, no nothing...
The competition system is... dead...
Some of the base setups are extremely poor. You need to learn how to do your setups.
Additional official content is expensive and the packaging is bad.
The tire model is weird. Some people praise the tire model but I'm not so impressed. Here is why: Cars are always faster with tire pressures at the minimum. Loss of grip with tire temperature doesn't seem to be progressive and there doesn't seem to be an optimum temperature. The feeling is that either you have grip, Have a bit less grip or the tire has combusted...

So, some good things and bad things but overall I can recommend it if you are looking for sim that feels good driving and are willing to invest some time in it. Driving is very rewarding and that is the big strength here.

Yes UI is sluggish sometimes. Yes official content in the workshop is confusing, I often don't know which DLCs I own. Yes it is hard to find active racing communities.

Yeah I guess the physics simulation and force feedback are really, really good, but the rest of the experience is more often than not meh at best. The user experience is pretty bad and the AI is disappointing.

I'd recommend getting ACC and AMS2 before this one.. sure the simulation isn't as good but it's real close and they are better much in a lot of other ways and thus are better sims overall in my opinion.

And worst of all it's really the buggiest sim I've ever used, came out 8 years ago and it still feels unpolished. We're talking crashes, failure to install paid DLCs, glitches, at times very long loading times, the auto steering lock range not working, inability to shut down (forced to kill the process each times I quit) and more. You think F1 2021 was buggy at launch? Wait until you see rF2 after 8 years of support.

The AI is a massive mess, at times it's genuinely the best AI on the market but at other times it's by far the worst. It's practically impossible to find the right AI difficulty for you since it's pace can vary wildly for no apparent reason, for month until two days ago around 85% was the overall sweet spot, yesterday the AI became really slow for unknown reasons and I had to go up to 100% and even then there was instance where a massive pace differences could form between me and the AIs for a race duration. And today it changed again and now I can barely get less than 5 seconds the slowest AI after just one lap, always on the same tracks with the same cars. What gives??

Still on the AI, most sims have a way to guess what the grid order should be without qualifications so you can jump straight to racing. While this game still does it's super inaccurate, still requires you to do qualifications, not doing any sort of qualifications will put every cars randomly on the grid which doesn't make for good racing. Also the AI needs to be trained, so if you don't do practice and/or qualifications will be dumber and slower, also making racing worse.

Bonus points for the insane storage space this sim takes, I have less cars and tracks than in AMS2 yet rF2 takes 110Go while AMS2 takes 60. AMS2 also load faster on average from my HDD than rF2 from my SSD. Yikes.

In general my experience with this sim can be summed up by this sentence: ""Okay, what's the problem now?"", because fixing issues is by far the second thing you'll do the most in this sim.

Edit: yeah thanks for adding items to the publisher sale in the middle of the sale, I wasted 20 bucks and can't be refunded because they sell their DLCs as in-game store items and they have a much smaller refund window. In all honesty to me it's obvious their in game store is the way it is to nickel and dime players because of that and other reasons. Also so they can use DLCs to dishonestly market the game, I swear about 1 screenshot our of 5 contains stuff you wan't get when buying the sim, but hey, it's not DLC, it's ""in-game store items"" right?
Edit 2 S397 boogaloo: So yeah now they released 4 news DLCs, I bought two because I didn't want to spend too much, turns out they waited a bit after they released their DLCs before releasing a bundle with those DLCs for barely more than what I paid for just two of them, just got tricked into spending more again.

With the recent UI update and improvement in load times, the game is in a pretty solid place.  The load times are still slower than the other sims but they are much better and tolerable.  

The driving experience is absolutely outstanding.  The car physics and the force feedback are the best you will find.  Driving tracks like Sebring and the Nordschleife will literally make you giggle as the force feedback is incredible.

The sound is good in the sense that the note of the cars sound like the actual cars.  Its not the best sound model as far as quality,  but the sound is good and immersive enough since the cars sound like the real cars.  I've also heard the studio is working on a new sound model.  

Not as good as the games like AC and Raceroom when it comes to setting up a specific race against specific vehicles and drives when you want to recreate an event, but similar to ACC and AMS2 on this front.  

The graphics certainly aren't the best, BUT especially during sunset and sunrise the game looks very good.  Its not as beautiful as AMS2, ACC, or a modded AC for the most part, BUT it certainly isn't ugly and what I would consider a good looking game.  Not great but good.  

In summary, the game I find to be the best simulation in terms of driving, that is slightly behind in terms of graphics, sound, and UI and loading times, BUT not where the game once was were it was a major negative.  A worthy buy for sure.  Just note you are going to have to buy packs outside of the base game to get you the cars and tracks you want.  Just now that the laserscanned tracks are the best you will find in sim racing.

I had to install it three times before I got more than one car and track.  Very little information about the cars (nothing like Assetto Corsa's detailed descriptions).   Overall, everything but the actual driving is painful and unpleasant.  

I bought it on sale for about half price and didn't get my money's worth.

The driving is better than Assetto Corsa, but not enough to make up for RF2's failings.  Automobilista 2 has a very similar driving experience wrapped in a much more pleasant package (UI, etc.).   

Note I'm using a Logitech G920 and Thrustmaster T-LCM pedals; it could be that someone with a high-end direct drive wheel would perceive bigger differences between this, AC, and AMS2.

Update 2/4/2022:

I saw the news about the new UI and decided to give it another try.  Took forever to download and when it starts I have to wait still more for in-game updates.  Track load times are better.  Overall, it is *better*, but still not good.   For instance I went through the non-obvious control setup and my pedals, while I could calibrate them, weren't recognized when I was in the car.   Turns out you have to go to Steam properties and turn off steam controllers.   

Graphics are about GTR2 level (despite it's age GTR2 is better than RF2 in many usability and immersion aspects).   At best they're a shade below AC without CSP -- lots of flickering fences, etc.   I can't believe a game that's still being sold and updated in 2022 still has less than smooth curves on the track edge.  

Picking a car is weird.  What's with the canvas-covered cars in the menu?   Which cars have paddle shifters, FWD, etc. - the information isn't there.

Once you're on the track -- if you're patient enough to actually get there. The driving is great, great enough that it's a real shame that the physics engine, tire modelling, etc. isn't wrapped in a better package.

It is very hard to make this playable from the graphics point of view (regular AND VR). For example AMS2 looks quite good but I'm not able to achieve same results with rF2. For few hours now I have searched and tried to test for optimal Nvidia and rF2 settings, but it still looks like grap. When pulling of from the pit, fences and stuff looks bad, they vibrate etc.

When quitting the sim it won't stop. Exe keeps running. Steams shows Stop although UI is not running.

Nvidia game experience does not have settings for rF2. Not sure if game experience is usefull but with this I would have tried it.

 But the rest of this sim is a piece of crap. It feels like it's still in beta version.  Full of bugs, no online servers, new UI is flickering every time in vr when you load a menu /getting headache because of that/.
 I had faith in their new competition system but they failed with it. That is on full of bugs as well. Barely works. And a little surprise by studio 397. I've got all the paid tracks and cars which is needed for GTE series except the new corvette c8r and I couldn't sign up for that GTE series because that car is missing. There is a button beside the sign up button if you click on that surprisingly that's working very well!!! That takes you to a page where you can buy that c8r. What a joke! I've bought almost all of their DLC's to support them but looks like it was a waste of my money.
 They should work on bugs first to make a much better experience instead of paid content. After many years of struggle I finally gave up on rF2. Don't buy it! rF2 could be the best sim in the world but sadly it won't be a finished product.

Update 2022: With the new UI update flickering came back in VR every single time when I start a session or close that. But it doesn't really matters because I can't run this game in VR anymore. At certain points of a racetrack I've got massive fps drops which makes racing impossible and cause me headache. Even if I stop the car at those points with no other cars around me I've got fps drop until I leave that section. Few months before I could run this game buttery smooth. 
Sometimes when I go out to the track from pit ffb is gone like doesn't exist. I can fix that problem easily by simply teleport to pit and start again but if it happens at the start of an online race you can't do that. Really annoying. 
All in all these guys can disappoint me with their every single update. Thank you guys for your hard work to make this game worse and worse. I regret every single euros which I spent on this piece of crap!",1611701597,1643455144,False,4,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

I feel it only right to revisit my original review from last year, after numerous issues trying to get rF2 to initially load, and fail to load.

Those issues have now been resolved, and I can see exactly why people talk about the physicals, the tyre models and ffb. It is by far the most realistic in terms of the 3 of any game I have experienced, and in addition the way in which the AI behaves at time is truly breathtaking. An example was a 20 lap GT3 race I did earlier today at Donnington Park, going wheel to wheel with the AI down the back straight without contact, going 2 abreast into the chicane without contact. As someone who has raced across multiple sims, AC and ACC to name but 2 this has blown me away and I would like to take that negative review back.

I am looking forward to the new UI launching next week which promises to lift the game to the next level.

As a motorsport fan and not a sim racer, the game is very difficult to start up, set up settings and get going for the general consumer

I had a gamepad and attempted a race and it just isn’t worth the hours of searching the settings 

I am happy I picked it up tho (on sale) to try it out now and again but it seems you need a far bigger investment and be a bit more serious to play this, I.e. a wheel and pedals.

ACC Imo has better controller support but lacks the variety this game offers. 

I was also a bit annoyed at the multiplayer lobbies, it was very difficult to find one that is compatible with the base versions so it seems you do need a lot of the dlcs to get into these servers or mods. So do pick these up it on sale.

Id give it a 6/10 as a general casual gamer review 

Im sure it’s higher rated for more serious sim gamers perspective

Here's some more of my blabbing about this title:
just had my first 2.4 Hour race. Le mans, LMP3, locked setup. on rFactor's internal competition system. Started 15/21, came in 5th and couldn't be happier! (Longest race I had before that, was 1.5H endurance rance on AC, on Sim Racing System)

Every time I go into AC I think ""game looks beautiful (SOL), and it's comfortable to use"". but then I drive it, and go, ""godammit, this FFB is crap"". 
Then, ACC  never took off for me because unreal's VR support is _so unbelievably bad_. (got to replace my gtx1070 with a rtx3080 and still couldn't get a nice looking picture while keeping 90 fps.) (i5 9600k)

I bought rFactor2 a couple of months ago and I can't stop driving it. I wish the competition system took off and more players would have used it. I think drifting in rF2 is Soooo much better than in AC, and for a darn good reason - the FFB feels great, you always know what the car is doing!

rFactor2 is the first game I ever enjoyed driving in the rain; again, because of the great feel coming through the FFB. you can tell that the grip is diminishing, and it's easy to accommodate.

AC and rF2 are both really good at going into motion smoothing mode. which is really important for your VR experience. Unfortunately I didn't find it the same with unreal engine (Kartkraft / ACC) or with dirt 2.0. they stutter when changing between motion smoothing and normal mode. 
Although AC definitelly looks better, it was never about graphics for me. it was always about the physics. rF2 takes the cake. Only time I'm starting AC is to remind myself what poor FFB I used to drive.",1636405026,1642219558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike the other sims Rfactor 2 FFB is pure Raw feedback, you feel the elasticity of the wheel, the road chamber changes or any weight difference through the FFB, People is right, there's no other sim ( yet ) with a FFB better than this.

Graphics and sound are average, nothing to highlight, well yes, one thing, the replay cameras. Those cameras are the most realistic I've ever seen, photorealistic close to gran turismo sport ones.

In general this sim is a must if you love simracing, there's no reason to not buy it ( I bought it on sale at 7€ ).

Rfactor 2 as a product is kinda weird because they sell you the simulator engine alone, and then you have to download the cars and tracks from the workshop for free and then wait for it to install the subscribed content into the game, I guess the workshop content is compressed. I loved that method instead of a handfull of ""cheap"" dlcs.

Free content is pretty basic, you can easy tell by watching some videos from the nordschleife and the paid cars, it's night and day. Nonetheless you can have so much fun with free content and most important community made tracks and cars, some of those are high quality content, there's no need to buy the official content. 

Multiplayer is garbage, you have two options:

- Play singleplayer againsts AI ( It's a damn good AI tbh)
- Create your own server to play with friends and AI

Don't you ever try to join a multiplayer session, that's not gonna happen. The game will start to download 3256784K mods and will freeze until you force quit it.

if this game had a simple and functional multiplayer all other simulators would be in its shadow.

And yes, it took me more than 3 hours to setup my server, holly molly, you need to create and pack a mod to create a track/car session?? what the even heck??

If you still think that it's a good idea to setup a server, remember to create a desktop shortcut of the game and put the local ip of your machine, if you access it through the game menu you'll get disconnected.

The Steam Workshop opens up TONS of killer content not the least of which is a bunch of historic tracks / cars.

Worth every penny if you value physics over eye-candy. Not to say that the graphics are bad just...a bit dated.

(I have Tried project cars 2 and Assetto Corsa before this.) the physics compared to PC2 is better. tyres are very accurate and also i dont get bad performance in VR as it looks good and isnt too heavy on CPU/GPU. this games UI is ok and has improved but still not too easy to use. in PC2 you can easily lose traction for a second and completely spin out even when just straight line accelerating. the feel of FFB on this game is beautiful and the feeling of the tracks even on an old wheel is still very immersive. one really big downside is if you want to do multiplayer sessions. it takes days to setup a dedicated session which is the only way of playing online and is extremely complicated and difficult to work out, not to mention how many people get different errors individually this is ridiculous and needs to be fixed.

Tracks and Cars: 
there is a limited amount of cars and tracks in this game, or at least official ones, the track and car prices are way too high and there are barely any cars you actually get when you buy this game so you must be willing to spend more money. personally i would just buy automobilista 2 if you want a better experience but this games physics engine is nearly unrivaled but automobilista 2 still feels amazing and is better playing multiplayer and also isnt heavy on performance, AMS 2 also has more cars and trakcs and is being updated continuosly

If it did everything it claims to properly, it'd be great, but it gets in its own way so much none of those features are usable or noticeable.
Worst though, apart from the epic number of problems this title has, almost all of which will never be fixed, the Force FeedBack is vague, laggy and therefore utterly useless.
OK, to be fair, if you turn the strength down enough to avoid clipping it can be moderately immersive from a gaming perspective (as long as the track has features to actually feel; most are billiard table smooth to avoid numerous complaints and resultant low ratings from the ingrates who download it for free and forget that real roads are not smooth at all).
From a sim driving perspective though, the FFB is too delayed to be of any practical use at all (if you wait until you feel the slide, you're already going off); to the point where I just did a practice session at Sachsenring in the Porsche GT3 DLC and I was half a second quicker with the feedback at zero (no self-centering, nothing, and it happened due to a bug but I figured I'd keep driving to see how hard it would be and it was actually easier). And before you start thinking ""well this whinger clearly can't drive,"" take a look at who is on top of the Overall Leaderboard Ranking for Automobilista's time trials on virtualxperience dot net. Spoiler alert: As I write this review, it's me, so I am at least reasonably competent.
Oh, and another thing to be aware of if you still feel like wasting your money on this is the stated PC specs required are many years out of date. You'll need something way faster, with way more video RAM, and way more available HDD space.
If you're here because you saw the FIA using it for a virtual series, note how many races they get through without throwing a red flag or three because the servers have lost the connection with everyone.
If you're looking at my play hours that's mostly load times (they were stupid for many years) and going off to make dinner while the track rubbers-up the first time I use it (there's no offline 'hotlap' mode, and working on the setup is pointless on a green track; at least 'real road' can be saved, if you remember to).
The DLC also feels very samey (the physics appear to be cut-paste from one GT3 to the next, but that might just be another sign of how bad the FFB is), there's comparatively little free content that isn't now out of date (and unlikely to get updates from authors who have moved on), you can't easily fix community-made stuff yourself like AC, the content from Steam Workshop takes up double the HDD space it needs to because it doesn't delete the download file after RF2 has installed the track or car, the AI are pedal stabby-stabby numpties, and I'm bored of typing now.

Yes the menu is not the easiest, but once you know where to find everything, u'll be fine.

Notes
* UI is not that bad, im not sure what people are on about, you need a mouse since controller wont work
* ive never had issues with controls, despite having a pretty awkward setup and having a few different wheels that ive used.


Pros:
+ Better VR performance than most other games
    This is the major reason I am writing my review, this is the first sim racing game that looks good and runs over 60fps in VR, other games such as AC, ACC, iracing, PC2, etc all seem to blur the crap out of my game, or just run at under 40 fps.
+ Good realism compared to other games

Cons:
- Messy Multiplayer * 
    This is the main down-side... The multiplayer system is just bad. 
- Frequent Crashes
- Weirdly priced DLC
- Maps take a long time to load for the first time.. keep that in mind before complaining about loading times (i refunded this game a while back before realizing this, takes about 30s-1m after first load)

Wheel: Logitech G920.

Pros:
+Physics (currently the only game that can really convey the whole driving feeling in a believable way)
+AI very good, it's possible to have great races with them as long as you have 'respect' during a fight
+Sound
+A lot of modded content - probably the only reason why i was playing it so long

Cons:
-UI is a matter of taste, many hate it and I can understand but personally I prefer a game where I can adjust everything (especially in the game files to be able to design the racing the way you like it and to make it more immersive)
-DLC is pretty overpriced but the tracks are good actually, if you put a lot of value on laser scanned tracks
-As I said there is a lot of content, there is also sort of a lack of Content (i.e. no LMP1 cars, not so much tracks like AMS or AC etc.) but I hope the community will add some more cool stuff soon

In less than 15minutes of playtime, I can already 100% tell you I won't be able to play game this due to the fact that someone thought that having a white background everywhere was a good idea. Had a migraine kicking in by the time I got to the main menu. 

First time opening the game brought me to the Setup Wizard. Full white background with some small text boxes asking for a name and nickname. I had to use the backspace because if I didn't my username would've been ""Your Nicknamedorlaz"". This is a quite difficult task, to sort a place holder, and it's not like this game has been released in 2013, with almost a decade to sort this or something but, moving on...

After setting my nickname (to just ""dorlaz""), it's time to setup the controls, with a full white background with, again, just black text on it. My g29 wasn't recognized so I had to go trial and error on my keyboard trying to find unbinded keys. D was steering right, Z and < were something else I assigned after (probably accel and brake; already forgot about it so you can tell it was a good experience). 
OH and the game also detected that my keyboard has a 918 steering angle, somehow. The more I know! With a bit of luck, it also has ffb.

After sorting the (random keyboard) controls, time to jump on practice mode and set the wheel. 
Only not. 
Time to download a small amount of content. Just 24GB of content I might want. The download size from Steam was 1.5GB in size, only to have to download more than 24GB after, after opening the game, still full white background. Nope.

After sorting that (10minutes later), the game finally shows its main menu. It's a white background with a stricking blue and red. 

By now, with a migraine kicking in and with one eye closed and the other nearly there, I still had to set up the wheel so tried to navigate to the settings menu.

Once I opened the settings menu, I had to instantly close the game. Couldn't stand looking at it 1 more second. 
The settings menu has a completely white background with some text and icons, too small to make a difference, and light grey tabs on the bottom to navigate to graphics, sound, etc. 
I don't even remember if I Alt-F4 out of the game or not. Couldn't stand looking at this game no more.

Awful experience and didn't even got to play the game.

What you're getting is simulation software that allows you to download race cars and race tracks from the Steam workshop so you can race them within a simulator. You also have the option to buy official DLC content to add value to your experience.

What's the issue ? It's not a highly polished title by any means. It's really rough around the edges and it's more of a toy than a highly polished game title you expect from a game console ect ..

After fidgeting around the menus and messing about the simulator, I uninstalled and re-installed the simulator so that I can start fresh having a better understanding of what it offers & how to configure my XBOX ONE S controller and my MOMO force wheel. Those work just fine but you need to bind the controls to your liking to get the most out of it. 

The reason I re-installed it was because the first time I launched the simulator, I installed all the Steam workshop content when prompted within the simulator content section and it caused all sorts of buggy issues for me. The second time I simply opted to download the premium content only. ( I had to un-subscribed from all the workshop content first & delete the simulator directory after uninstalling it via Steam! )

In any case, the simulator is ok for what it is. It works fine with the XBOX ONE S, the MOMO force wheel and my HP Reverb G2 WMR headset. It requires patience to learn how to navigate the menu and configure your options. With that said, understand that this is not a video game. Like I stated before, it simply allows you to load in some cars on a track and take them for a spin. It does offer multi-player but I haven't tried that yet.

The cars are very responsive and it works well with the XBOX ONE S controller and my MOMO wheel. For the wheel to work the simulator needs a compatible profile and then you can edit that to customize your buttons ect ... Afterwards, you save your custom binding with any name you like. With that said, there aren't that many cars classes to run around with. Out of the premium content I downloaded, only 3 car classes allow for night time racing because they have functional headlights.   

AC CARS
NISSAN GT500 GT-R
RADICAL SR3

All others seem to be for daylight racing only. This is my first time trying out this simulator so there may be many more cars to choose from which can be used for night time racing. 

If you have patience and just want a simulator for a change this may be fun when configured properly. I have mixed feeling about it but purchased it because I liked the demo. The VR driving is pretty cool even though the simulator itself looks outdated graphics wise.


################################# 


Launching in VR:

In Steam, find the game in library click ...

Play >> Launch rFactor 2 Graphics Configuration >> Play

Set VR: HMD Only ( It's disabled by default! )

If you don't do this and then try to launch the game it won't load in VR mode!


############# UPDATE ############ 

I wanted to give this simulator a fair shot so I dug a little for some additional content to improve my experience. It's really enjoyable if you find the right content and configure it to function with a wheel & a VR headset.

One of the best tracks you can try is the Texas Motor Speedway. The lighting is great for night time racing and it's the perfect track to test drive various cars and tweak them to your liking. Trying out various simulator settings like difficulty levels,  A.I strength and aggression really helps you improve your overall experience.

As I stated before some cars do not offer headlights but you can easily find plenty of cars in the workshop by searching for ""headlights"" and that will help you find cars that you can race at any time. You can also narrow down searches by desired content such as ""tracks"" or ""circuits"" to help you avoid wasting time looking through all the workshop assets.

I like this simulator after spending some time in it. It shines with the right tracks, cars and gaming setup. Based on my experience, I highly recommend it. It works great with my HP Reverb G2 and the cars looks really nice from the driver seat!",1635539674,1635667822,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It has very very bad AI to drive against. No matter what opponents I choose, whether base game content or mods I have a very bitter experience.  As a person who only races offline this is  a deal breaker.

Also
the UI is bad
the graphics differs from track to track, 
The graphics when it is good uses so much CPU and frame rates drop alot
The base game content isn't very attractive especially the cars that they offer, not when you compare it Assetto Corsa.

Samsung OD+, HP Reverb.  O.k on the original rift.  Stutters like crazy.  Same VR settings in AC plus shaders patch and SOL on mostly high, PC2 on mostly medium and some high, AMS2 medium and high = butter smooth.  RF2 on the other hand = VR epileptic fit with everything on medium and 90%SS.  Tired of trying to get a decent experience with this and attempting to make it look alright at the same time.

Of all racing sims I've played, none feel as good as rFactor 2. Even on my T300, the force feedback is top-notch, being highly detailed but also slightly exaggerated enough to give you sublime control over the car you're driving. The physics are highly-detailed and unmatched by most sims, with cars behaving realistically and tracks evolving as you race. To put it into perspective, rFactor Pro, the professional simulator rFactor 2 is derived from, is used by real-world racing teams as their simulator of choice. The AI is track-dependent, but is generally very good, behaving like human drivers, including crashing out, but not at a rate that detracts from the racing experience, instead adding to its realism.  The flexibility of what you can do is also great, giving you essentially every track racing variation you could want, from short single-model races to 24-hour multi-class endurance races. The slight disappointment here is the lack of an in-game way of creating tournaments. This is remedied with external software, but an in-game solution would be much better. The graphics vary greatly between tracks and cars, but are generally pretty good. Although not quite as good-looking as ACC or modded AC, some cars and tracks truly shine, especially the newer tracks by Studio 397 that include PBR.

Where rFactor 2 really shines is with its wealth of high-quality community content. A huge variety of tracks and cars can be found, both on the Steam Workshop and external websites. The Studio 397 cars and tracks available to purchase are all  incredible and well worth the money, but if you're not willing to spend a bit more the community-made content available is vast and free. Although varying in quality, most are very high quality, giving you access to almost all racing series you could want, from 1960s endurance to modern-day F1.

I haven't played multiplayer so cannot be a good judge of its quality, but from what I've gathered from what others have said and the player stats, rFactor 2's multiplayer component is generally poorly populated. Organised events and leagues do exist, but casual drop-in multiplayer like other sims is essentially non-existent.

If you can get past the UI, rFactor 2 is an incredible sim. However, it's just that - a simulator. Do not expect the raft of other features seen in other racing games, but instead just enjoy one of the best racing simulators out there.

Original review:

One step forward, two steps back?

rF2 is the sequel to arguably the greatest racing sim ever made, while it shines in terms of physics and tyre simulation in some other aspects it doesn't feel like a considerable step forward, sometimes it even feels like it took a step back in some areas. I got rF2 back when it was a DX9 game. At the time it felt like rF1 with better physics, slightly better graphics, and less options for modding and customizing the game. When rF2 works properly it's an amazing game, unfortunately a lot of times it took me a lot of testing to get things to work properly.

Back in the DX9 days even with everything on ultra rF2 didn't look that much better than rF1, and definitely look subpar compared to games like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars. While Project Cars looked good and perform well with medium settings rF2 looked average at best with everything on ultra and was very demanding in terms of hardware. After the move to DX11 at first the game had some improvement in graphics but was very poorly optimized and had serious performance & framerate issues. After several patches over the months performance improved, but the game is still fairly demanding on hardware, one would need at least a GTX 1060 6GB to run rF2 at 1080p60fps with everything on ultra and post processing effects on medium. Imo running rF2 with all graphics settings on ultra is the only acceptable option for people who want decent graphics, anything below ultra and the game doesn't look that great imo. Back when I got the game I had a GTX 750 ti and I had to spend a lot of time testing the game to find the right balance between visual quality and performance, and even more time testing graphics settings after the move to DX11, but after I got a GTX 1060 6GB I was able to put everything on ultra and get decent performance.
In terms of presentation rF2 looks very dated, the UI and hud look very basic just like in rF1, and after the move to DX11 several hud pluggins stopped working. S397 made a few improvements to the hud afterwards but there's still no trackmap and the current hud has very limited information imo. S397 has been promising a new improved UI since 2016 but at the time of this review in 2019 there's still no new UI, and we're still stuck with a rF1-style basic dated UI.

rF1 is known as a modding platform that gives users lots of freedom to customize the game to their liking. rF2 still has mods and Steam Workshop, but because of lack of information from developers and the difficulty many modders have had to work with rF2 there's considerably less mods in rF2 than in rF1. Also, after the move to DX11 a lot of older mods from the DX9 version either stopped working or had serious issues, and not every modder bothered to update their content to DX11, in which case the only choice left was to uninstall the non-working mods and to try to find another one that was updated to DX11. 
Steam workshop was a great feature implemented into the game, it makes it a lot easier to install and manage mods. Unfortunately it's setup in a way that takes twice as much space on the disk than it should. Whenever you subscribe to Steam workshop content it saves a copy of the content in the rF2 install directory + a backup copy of the content in the workshop directory. If you delete the extra copy in the workshop folder it will automatically download it again. That goes for user created content as well as for official content (when you first install rF2 it will install only the base game, after you first run the game it will download and install all official content). That can be a real hassle if you have rF2 installed on a SSD with limited storage (btw rF2 has some pretty long load times on a HDD, installing it on a SSD is recommended imo). There are workarounds to decrease space used like installing mods by downloading the rfcmp file, or moving the workshop to another drive and creating a symbolic link, but imo it would be much more convenient to have the option to install only the content in the game directory without a backup in the workshop folder.
Customization options are fairly limited in rF2, while in rF1 one could easily edit files to customize cars and tracks to their liking in rF2 simply editing content files will result in the content disappearing from the game. Instead one would need to edit files that repack files into a new mod and reinstall it in order for the mod to work.

The base official content provides good variety of cars and tracks, with mods increasing even more the amount of content. S397 has been releasing paid DLC in recent years, most of which have been well received by the community, however since there's no country currency adjustment for the prices of DLC content depending on where you live DLC can be quite expensive (for me who lives in Brazil a number of the DLC packs are more expensive than the base game).

Like in rF1 rF2 provides a number of options for practicing and setting up race weekends against AI. One can play quick races against AI or setup a full race weekend with practice, qualifying and race with dynamic weather. I've heard a number of times over the years people saying rF2's AI is the best in the business. Honestly after playing a bunch of races with a number of different combinations of cars & tracks I think the AI in rF2 is good but not amazing by any means. It's still have some of the same issues found in other games like AI being too fast in qualifying and too slow in the race, AI that's unaware of player and crash into their car, and also the AI doesn't work properly in wet races (it pits for tyres on every lap). Just like in most other racing games one has to be careful and give AI some space especially during the first lap, but once one figures out the proper difficulty level and gets used to AI behavior they can be challenging and fun to race against.

I'm playing the game on a Xbox 360 controller, imo the default controller settings suck and don't really fit my driving style. The way controller settings work in rF2 are a bit different than in rF1 so it took me a while and lots of testing to figure out proper controller setup. After I figured it out the game became very enjoyable to play, challenging but fun. Btw there's still no controller rumble.

Overall it's a pretty good game once you figure out how to setup things to your liking. I wish the game was better optimized and had better presentation, but even after the move to DX11 there's only so much developers can do compared to other games that were built from the start on more modern game engines & APIs. If you already own games like rF1, GTR2, AMS1, and you want to try a challenging game with more advanced car and tyre physics I'd definitely recommend rF2.",1573851811,1630372928,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a fairly new to sim racing and I use a fairly cheap Thrustmaster T300 RS GT wheel, so please don't take any of this as an informed opinion.

I've been mainly playing AM2 and ACC to date, having also put time into R3E, AC, F1 20XX, WRC. Maybe 200-300h in total. I recently got hooked on the Nordschleife in AM2. After a while though I felt like that sim wasn't quite doing it for me on that track for some reason (too easy/too bland? Could be something about my config).

I had tried rFactor 2 a few times before and hated the experience each time. Horrible UI, none of my controls worked as expected even with the preset profiles, cars did weird things in the pitlanes, audio quality randomly declined after an update (make sure you max you number of effects in the audio menu if it's set to 1) and I had to deal with a number of random crashes relating to downloaded updates and video settings randomly changing. Overall, a horrible horrible horrible experience by the standards of games you actually have to pay for!

However I keep hearing about the quality of the game's sim modelling and level of track detail, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy the F1 Pro pack (currently on discount) to get some good tracks, including specifically the Nurburgring in all its configurations.

Again, the setup experience was painful, and I still need to put some time into following some setup guides for the AI and look into mods...

But after a couple hours of faffing about trying to get things working and waiting through the insanely long track load times, I finally managed to get the Nissan R35 onto Nords and start doing a few laps in anger.

I was immediately struck by how incredibly visceral everything feels. The FFB, the bumps and grooves of the track, having to constantly react to and micro-correct for road imperfections. Holy crap!

The driving is a lot more demanding than what I'm used to in AM2, but it also feels a lot more controlled and communicative. I loose control and crash a lot more here, but I also feel the limits when I cross them and I'm learning to respond to that in a more timely manner.

I'm nowhere experienced enough to judge how good or bad this driving experience might truly be compared to the other sims I've tried, but all I can say is that for a relative noob like me, the experience was a complete eye opener as to what a sim could/should feel like.

So, if you're on a tight budget and don't want to waste money, if you're not a good problem solver and you dislike editing text files, and if you don't have the patience of a g****mn saint... Then maybe give this one a miss...

But I'm none of those things apparently, and in the end I can't wait to get back in and see what I can make of this game and what looks like a huge ecosystem of mods for it.

YMMV.

rFactor2 is Simultaneously the best and the worst racing game there is.  If you want to race with AI and maybe a few friends, this game is easily the best that there is.  The physics are outstanding and the AI typically races very well.  The network code is great too.

Studio 397 has been doing a great job improving the game;  However, rFactor2 has never really been able overcome many of the poor decisions that we made when the product was launched.  The game originally came with an annual fee to race online, which prevented rFactor2 from building an online player base.  The mod system was supposed to simplify using different content compared to the first rFactor, but in my experience, I have never been able to join a public server.

O jogo é ótimo, melhor singleplayer de simulador de corrida que eu joguei ate agr do pra fazer tudo nisso, o menu principal é gostosinho de mexer não é mais aquele trosso feio q era antigamente, da pra configurar corrida por volta ou tempo, da pra por sessões multiplas de qualificação (q1, q2, q3), escolher entre largada parada ou andando, treinos livres, corridas de classe mista, regras, punições stop and go drive thru, bandeiras azul, amarelas e full corse yellow, da pra brincar com estrategias de pitstop, escolher oponentes carro por carro, porra e td flui mto bem.

a ia é super dinamica, ela corre pra krl mas tbm faz merda, roda, da umas patinada em saida de curva, freia tarde, se tu bota pressão ela puxa o carro pro meio da pista e defende igual na vida ou faz o mesmo pra te passar, para pra trocar pneu quando tem q trocar. por fim a ia é muito viva a unica coisa que nao consegue fazer é correr na chuva, isso parece problema do jogo msm nao da dificuldade o que é um saco pq a corrida de chuva desse jogo é sinistra. os cara la tem q consertar isso aí.

as dlcs sao muito boas mas caras pra quem ta pensando em comprar pode intimidar bastante, e mais, as dlcs nao ficam na loja oficial da steam é uma mini lojinha na pagina do jogo aqui na steam mesmo, por isso, as grandes promoções da steam nao se aplicam pros dlcs desse jogo, quer dizer quando rola uma promo as coisas aqui continuam full price, o que é uma filhadaputagem dos cara lá.

mais uma vez a mesma situação do assetto corsa, tu consegue o triplo do conteudo em mod só olha a workshop, serio nem passa nas dlcs ainda, olha a workshop primeiro e ve oq vc acha.

eu recomendo tava pensando em comprar gtsport mas depois q eu botei umas horas de jogo nesse aqui e vi oq ele é capaz eu mudei de ideia vo ficar por aqui msm. e o jogo suporta controle, da pra jogar igual gran turismo tranquilo se vc tiver um controle decente que leia teus comandos direito, e uma ultima coisa, muito cuidado com a demo quando eu joguei era de um port antigo pra cacete e n tem nada a ver com o port final q eu comprei.",1628868436,1628869262,True,5,0,0.540241003036499023,0,True,False,False

This is the only thing on my computer right now, I actually got a second computer, vr, race wheel and chassis because of how good this simulator is and the need for multipayer... I gave up console gaming for this. 

I should say it is not a game, first it takes a long time to set up and properly calibrate to each system, second there is no story, it is not a car driving role playing game its a simulator which brings me to point three: IT IS HARD. A game hopes to draw you in by providing that sweet satisfaction associated with victory or rewards be it well earned or not; this is a simulation and while the ai can be turned down and handy caps can be turned on or up its core is to be challenging. There are no real unlocks just downloadable content and real life attachments which can start at a few hundred dollars and sometimes (more often) cost thousands of dollars.

I have not felt better wheel sensation in any other simulator software, i do not believe there is better tyre modelling in any other software. I have a professional grade sim... and soon it will have motion (Evil laugh)",1628866355,1628866355,True,6,3,0.535667955875396729,0,True,False,False

I bought it with respect for rF1 which has changed simracing forever. But rF2 was so bad, so I uninstalled it. I started to think about giving another chance to this project after watching official Le Mans virtual race which was running on this simulator. So, I started to reinstall this a week ago and… 
It took me two days just to install that horror. Required disc space is a lie. After installing main 3+gb it automatically started to install 9 (or so gb. I can’t remember exactly) workshop items. Downloading speed was so slow, so I unsubscribed to test just few basic cars and tracks. But it didn’t work! After game launching it started to subscribe to workshop items again and download and “update” it from main menu. But this time it was something like 20+gb! 
And this is where the second huge problem appeared. It not only downloads workshop items – game copies them to its internal folder. WHAT THE HELL?! I had 50+gb free disc space but it ran out because of it. 
I uninstalled the game and unsubscribed from all workshop items after one weekend of playing, but 26gb was still there :D So, I had to delete the directory manually.

Ok, rFactor2 has one the best physics engine so far. But who cares? All modern sims have enough good physics to practice (even rFactor1 was used for real race teams training).
Also, in initial set-up screen game asked me which gearbox I’m using – manual or sequential. Seriously? Is it the best simulator in the world? Don’t the cars here use the real gearbox types? I hope there are some difference between cars transmissions here, but that sim doesn’t give you any info about it. For example, r3e forces you to use sequential or h-pattern depending on a real car. Automobilista 2 have info about gearbox, but let you choose the one you prefer (but still requires real clutch handling according to real cars). Sorry, but rFactor2 doesn’t give a ****. Also, there are many settings in the menu, like auto blip, auto clutch, etc, so it looks like all transmission “realism” is up to you, not the real car. Correct me, if I’m wrong. 
Well, this game has the worst sounds I’ve heard. Not only the glitch that switches number of effects to 1, so you can’t really hear the engine sounds :D But the overall quality is soooo bad. It reminded me some race games from 90’s.
Game is glitchy. Better than ACC in that case… Much better😊 But it refuses to start sometimes. It could change settings automatically. Especially controllers.
In initial set-up screen it refuses to setup my 900 degree steering wheel correctly. It told me that it’s only 600. So, I changed it to 900 in settings, but… Real and visual rotation in game differs here :D It’s 2021 and you haven’t made it? All modern sims have done it many years ago, but not this one. And yes, I checked the boxes in the settings. Maybe it's just a glitch, but what the hell again.
VR works bad here. 
Game has random freezes sometimes.
Loading times are unacceptable.
rFactor2 is a huge disappointment.
I hope they will impove it, but there are many other better simulators now.",1628668632,1628668632,False,6,3,0.53962397575378418,1,True,False,False

I bought it to experience formula E and although the cars handle and drive fine. The art assets are awful and the Formula E tracks have so many rough edges graphically that it just turns me off the game. Especially with the price of the content. I expected more for my money.

I cant stress enough how disappointed i am at the poor detail put into Formula E's content. Sadly many of the cars have pixellated or grainy textures and some even have a weirdly brown tint over them.

Overall if those Graphical problems didnt exist. I would be genuinely optimistic.

If i were to suggest improvements to the game. My request would be more Formula E tracks.
The game also needs a bit more structure to it. (Pre-set championship, rules, competitors and tracks).
I would appreciate an option to completely remove the Halo as it occasionally disorientates me. Even when transparency is at the lowest.
This forces me into t-cam but the t-cam gives the most obvious view of the pixellated textures across the car.
More Formula E content because its got lots of potential for thousands of hours of enjoyment.

Im keep my eye on the progress of the game. Maybe theres a modder around willing to fix those graphical issues with the Formula E content i have.

This is not a game, neither is it a complete simulator. With some work from the developer this could easily be the racing game to beat all racing games.

Force feedback (with Fanatec GT3 RS Wheel from around 2010) is probably the best of all the sims, with the sim (with some car models) communicating exactly what the car is doing / going to do, when its right every detail of the road surface is signalled.

Visually the sim is quite nice, in daytime at least, night time lighting is bad. Audio is usually disappointing. 

Physics / modelling is very good, however there are some issues with meta setup choices that really shouldnt work but do (minimum tyre pressures). 

The game UI is pretty awful and even the new UI they have been developing for a year or two is an improvement but still quite dated and clunky. 

The game has no support at all for a single player championship (3rd party external tools can be used to cobble one together). 

Ai is quite entertaining and frustrating to drive with, at time very lifelike and battles hard for position at others very computerlike and will randomly brake for a fast corner etc. They are always incapable of modulating throttle or brake it seems meaning that for some cars they cannot complete more than a handful of laps without ruining the tyres. With quite alot of trial and effort really good single player races can be had with the right car and track and the right AI settings.

I have purchased around half of the paid add on content and all of it is very high quality usually with it being one of the best examples of the car/track in sim racing. Many mods are available both in the steam workshop and on external websites, it is hit or miss. Some of it is superb, some is rehashed rubbish from ancient games that was never very good in the first place. Vehicles are provided with a single 'factory' setup they are usually awful and often undrivable. There is a very large selection of mod content available.

S397 / ISI have made many improvements since launch, but progress now is very slow with more effort going into high quality paid content it seems.

However despite all these flaws the experience can be amazing, try hotlapping the BMW M2 Competition around nordschleife for example, brilliant (both are paid content).",1605467331,1626632056,True,15,0,0.681496202945709229,0,True,False,False

- Good physics

- Lots of mods (lots of good tracks but cars are quite bad - low poly interiors, bad FFB, poor sounds)

Cons:
- Loading times. Having to wait for 15 minutes to get into a race is unacceptable. It completely kills the game.
- Terrible UI. Lots of lags, very impractical. The game freezes for 10 seconds at least when you try to set up basic parameters for a race (opponents, number of laps) because it loads your favorite servers, even when you don't have any. This ""new"" UI is a complete failure (although it looks a bit better than the old one).
- The base content is laughable (very old cars, low poly interiors, poor sounds). You need to purchase DLCs in order to enjoy the game.
- Overpriced DLCs and a weird business model.
- Poor optimization. You need to edit a json file to gain some FPS.

I can't recommend this game unfortunately. It is a huge waste of time. The developers should really do something about the loading times and the UI at least.

First of all, it has the worst UI ever. Non intuitive, really sluggish, takes a shit ton of time to find out where stuff is, takes a shit ton of time to navigate through the menus.

The following keyboard shortcuts are not working: ctrl alt del, alt f4, alt tab, ctrl alt esc. So you're basically stuck with this crap on top of everything and cannot go to other windows. Why's this a problem? Well because I tried to join a server and it started to download a ton of content and I wanted to do other stuff during this time. I couldn't. So I thought, ok, I'll just cancel that and try to join other server, maybe it'll be less stuff to download. The game just told me a big ""Fuck You!"" because you CAN'T FUCKING CANCEL THAT! So I had to force shutdown my pc, by holding the power button pressed.

Why I wanted to join a server? Because 70% of the time I've spent in the game it was spent trying to play on LAN with a friend BUT YOU CAN'T FUCKING DO THAT. So we thought we'll join an empty server.

In single player it also has problems. The force feedback suddenly disappears some times when you go back to the pits. You can't pause the fucking thing. If you don't have a shifter and use paddles, you can't put it in reverse. You need to keep the reverse button pressed for fuck's sake.

It comes with absolutely 0 content. You have to download everything after you install the game because you're getting 0 content. Yeah, there's tons of content available for free in the workshop, but not getting at least the official content with the game? Come the fuck on...

I want my money back, but I already have over 2 hours spent in game mostly just getting annoyed and angry because the experience is a piece of shit.",1625768456,1625768621,False,10,3,0.600826799869537354,0,True,False,False

Immediate refund for me. I presume the devs are putting all their efforts into cars and tracks that you have to buy because the default stuff that comes with the game is really pitiful. 

I love the Portugal track in AMS2 its amazing in that game but in this game is just a stinker, the textures look atrociously bad. They really put me off playing the game. 

I mean yes the GUI is absolutely terrible as well - who uses drop down menus in games? This isnt Excel. Its so confusing trying to pick tracks and cars. Took me ages to figure out how to actually pick a different track.

I got two crashes in 1 hour as well trying to load tracks. Never had a crash in AMS2 after 30hrs so far or PCars 1 and 2 after 190hrs each.

The rendered people are laughably bad. I mean really in a modern game like this they are not good enough. They look like 'The Hood' from Thunderbirds, all of them lol.

The default cars look really bad as well and the car views are quite rubbish - you cant pan around the car in external view, and it's either really close to the car or really far away depending on the car, why isn't it at a set distance? All the cars are textured in lowres textures. They all look cartoony, not real at all. The latest BMW looks nice but that' just one car, you have to buy all the rest.

I tried the recent BMW car using autopit and the car scrapes out of the pit bay and then manages to crash into the cars parked opposite and then goes up the bank on the way out of the pit lane. Really? Is this meant to be a finished professional game?

I played Indianapolis where you start by leaving the pitbay - no directions on where you need to go to get to the track so I ended up driving around the pits for ages, I eventually found the track by following another car only to end up driving the wrong way lol. Finally got on the track and nothing telling you where to go no cones shutting off the rest of the oval track so I ended up just going around and around when I should have been doing the road course lol. Would it be too much work to add a track map? I don't know ...

So got to say the game is really bad. The driving physics might be the best in the world (arguable) but people will never get to try them with the game looking like this. 

I mean yes MAYBE if I spent a lot of money and bought some cars and tracks it might start to look better but I am not risking it. As you cannot refund tracks or cars (they are classed as 'in-game items') I am not willing to buy stuff either. Why the heck do they do this? It's easy enough to add them as external dlc that you can buy and refund if need be like everyone else does. Just stupid. 

I would like to say that I can see promise in this game and would love to get it so I can experience the driving physics properly, but the devs seriously need to do a lot of work on it sorting the GUI, improving the graphics - especially the people, and adding things like Custom Championships. I keep coming back to the fact that its expensive and why should I buy this and suffer all the issues when AMS2 works so well and looks so much better. They really need to get on top of these things. Maybe by the time Nascar21 comes out it will be better, but not holding out much hope. Shame really.

[h1]Pros: [/h1]

Good AI (when tweaked via the player.json file) and decent AI if no file tweaks. They will race you, they can make mistakes-- overall pretty enjoyable to race them.

The force feedback in this game I think is absolutely unmatched-- comparing to AC, ACC, and AMS2. You feel exactly what the vehicle is doing at all times and what available grip is left in the tires. You can feel the suspension load on a certain side when steering or when the track has some unevenness.

All the paid DLC and a good majority of the free DLC in the workshop are extremely high quality.

Lots of free great-quality DLC in the workshop.

Work surprisingly well with the Valve Index and I think this my favorite game to use with VR now, Can run at some super high settings using a 2080 Super OC-- Such as MSAA 8x, 160% resolution scale in valve index settings and getting around 90 fps. It looks CLEAN.

Since I am fairly new to this game, I think the UI is good and easy to use. Looking at older versions of the game's UI you can definitely see  a huge improvement.

If you want another hardcore simulator to add your list, look no further. Buy it, buy it now. This game is not ideal for casual racing imo.

Pretty happy with the purchase overall.


[h1]Cons: [/h1]

Can get pricey with all the paid DLC, but you can't go wrong if you get it all as every single piece of the paid DLC is super high quality. You get what you pay for.

You pretty much need to buy the DLC if you want to race any GTLM, GT3, or other endurance type vehicles.

Be prepared to do some research to really get the most out of this game. 

Default sound settings are meh-- they're significantly better when tuned. Have to adjust a lot of settings in the player.json file to really bring out some of the sounds.

I don't like that I can't set AI to do mandatory pit stops during a race. You can get around this by increasing the fuel usage to 3x-- this is one area that I really wish was a feature.

It would be nice if the cars that have the motec displays had scrollable pages like other sim titles.

The tire feel is amazing, and recent lighting, shader, and reflection graphical updates bring an extra layer of immersion that was previously missing. AI is great to race against and one of the strongest features of this game. Unlike other simulators, the AI in rFactor learn and adapt but you have to give them some time to do so. The best way is to set up a practice and/or qualifying session; use Ctrl+X to accelerate time and give them a lot of practice in a shorter time frame.

The new competition system is nice but there aren't too many timeslots and isn't super well populated yet. Still, it's a great low-friction way to experience some online races. For multiplayer races your best bet is to visit #RacePlace on the official Discord and look for a league that matches your tastes. Other good options are SimRacing-GP (highly recommended!) and JustRace.

If expensive DLC is putting you off, there is a bottomless source of free entertainment available via Steam Workshop mods. Sort by rating or most downloaded, and take try some. A few highlights: Anglesey Circuit, SMMG Formula 3, Lexus SC430 GT500, Group C Mod v1.1, Oulton Park Circuit. The game is surprisingly good to play with a game controller too though you probably will need to switch on some of the artificial assists.

I started wtih PC2, after 500 hours, I was frustrated with inconsistencies with AI, physics and tracks.  Then on to AC with Content Manager and SOL.  I put in about 200 hours and LOVED this games user friendly interface.  All the mods were great too.  However, I primarily race open wheel and AC does not implement the DRS rules correctly so that was a killer for me.  Also, I didn't like the constant playing with parameters so my VR experience with FPS did not suffer.

Now, onto fFactor 2.  I started wtih it about 2 months ago.  Since I'm new to it, I had really no issues with the UI, so I do think the hate for it is people do not like change.  To each his own.  The driving feels great with the physics and FFB being top notch.  Both a slight to moderate improvement over AC.  I also really like what the mod community has provided and have grabbed almost as much as I had with AC.

However, this game does have some ugly warts.  I HATE the fact that there is no easy way to pull HUD items on screen and drag them where you want like AC.  I believe this is a major blunder by Studio 397.  For having multiple options for single, triple and VR displays, this ability is a must and I hope is addressed.  Sure, I can use simhub and utilize overlays.  But when I do this, my FFB gets all wacky.  Utilizing devmode seems like a pain and even though I've not tried it just yet, may be to much for me to bare.

The other thing that is a pain it setting up and tracking single player championship series and tracking progress.  I've tinkered with this a little bit.  My thoughts are similar to the above, why can't there not be a simple interface to set this up like content manager in AC?  As I see on many message boards, this seems to scream loud and clear.  Being married with children(Where have I heard that before? :) ) I can not dedicate the kind of time required to participate in online leagues.  

One last complaint is the entire lack of setup information for parameters when you hover the mouse over it.  PC2 was very exhaustive in this respect and was great for noobies like me at the time.  AC was a little more cryptic however, since I played PC2 first, I was familiar with many setup parameters.  RFactor 2 gives NO information.  Sometimes I just need a quick reminder of what a parameter is and how it works.  Or jumping into a new car I'm not familiar with and have to jump out of my VR headset and look at guides to assistance.  

I think if Studio 397 fixes the above issues, with that added user friendly functionality, it would have a much better following and have a much larger market share in the sim market, perhaps even be the leader.

- The control some of these cars have is so satisfying. LMP2 cars grip well and are extremely fun.
- Entire flag system is fantastic.
- Game looks great in non VR
- Some of the cars sound amazing.

Unfortunately a lot of annoyances. 
The UI is just awful. I agree the old needed to be replaced though:
- I cannot exit a race after it's finished without the game crashing.
- Why can't I remove cars I don't want from a race? Why would it add MAX cars when I choose a class? Luckily I was familiar with creating a mod package to get around this.
- The game takes 5? minutes to load a race on an SSD. (I don't really care too much since you can adjust the entire weekend from inside the race, as well as controls / add or remove cars if needed).
- I crashed and wanted to watch the rest of one of my test races, the map feed is cool to see where everyone is on track, but then you go to camera the video feed is 5 fps. Pointless and lags the entire UI.

AI is fine during the race, it's really cool to see them spin or start to lose it and catch themselves. Unfortunately: 
- They crash into you before you can even pull out to start the formation lap unless you drive out quickly. (VERY quickly)
- Constantly slam their brakes during the formation lap / safety cars.
- Move directly into you or in front of you sometimes under blue flags. 
- I'm still messing with the settings but I haven't been able to get them to qualify correctly. I simulated LeMans and 8 or so LMP2's qualified behind the GTE's.

Overall the game is solid, but the UI updates are a huge step backwards IMO.

With every update you can look forward to finding out what has been broken this time. As you stand through countless of loooong loading screens and updates, you will pray for the race to successfully start. Often, it won't. Perhaps you are lucky and it is just a single track, car or race type that doesn't load and forces you to use to restart the computer. Then you will just to have to wait a few weeks or months until a patch that fixes this track. Maybe you are less lucky and no track or race whatsoever will work.

You will spend hours troubleshooting, following the tips from the Reddit or Discord forums, delete your shaders cache, repair your installation but most probably none of it will work. You'll just have to wait and hope next month you can play the game again.

You will never get your money back (the ugly monetization of tracks like Nürburgring or LeMans through the workshop will ensure that) and neither will you get your time back.

Admittedly, the racing is great. The cars sound nice and the graphics with day and night cycle on the newer tracks are strong and realistic.

That's not to say Assetto Corsa is bad, or even worse than this. But it's the easiest comparison I can make. 

Mod support is near equal to AC, but done through the Steam workshop which makes adding new content as easy as clicking 'Subscribe'. 

The physics feel different than AC, the only way I could describe them is that they feel 'tighter'. The sense of grip is much more tangible than in most other racing sims (not a surprise, as rFactor's tire physics are pretty much unrivaled). The force feedback is also a lot better off the bat. AC's force feedback can be tuned in a lot of depth, but in my experience, rF2's force feedback just feels great out of the box.

The only thing I don't like about this sim is the UI. It feels like it was designed to look like a racecar livery, which makes sense thematically, but sucks to use. It's laggy, and the layout is nonsensical. It looks pretty, but that doesn't help when it's a royal pain in the ass to use across the board.

Go run some laps on a new track in AMS2, for example, in a formula car and it's easy to a feel for the track, correct for oversteer, improve your times on the leaderboard, and get better. It's just not the case for me in rF2. Too frustrating. I like to run laps on the same track as upcoming Indycar races before I watch Quali and the race, so sometimes I have to use rF2 to get the track.

One the one hand, I concur with the community that rfactor 2 has the best physics and force feedback for a racing game that I've played. However, the game has managed to get worse when Studio 397 tried to make it better.

First off, the UI is trash and I really want to go back to the old one. There was nothing wrong with it, it was just a little ugly, but it worked. This new UI is just a reskin of the old UI, removes some options, and was illogically produced. To get to single player races, I have to wait for the game to LOAD MY FAVOURITE SERVERS EVERY TIME. WHO DESIGNED THIS? I don't even have any favourite servers, and it gets old to have to wait 30 seconds every time I want to change a setting in a race.

You'll be changing a lot of settings too, as the AI seem to be... interesting. In some cases, they're the best AI in a racing game. Other times, you'll be racing with 20 Nikita Mazepins, especially on the ovals. Despite S397 clearly making oval racing a priority with their multiple stock car releases, the state of the simulator in this regard is in taters. The yellow flags, essential for oval racing, are straight up broken. You'll often receive a penalty for going to slow while in the queue behind the pace car, and sometimes cars straight up don't catch the queue. You can't turn off the penalties without turning off yellow flags, which makes this ridiculous.

Don't waste your money, even though s397 wants you to spend $11 on a single track. I stopped paying attention to the DLC, which are confusingly put into a separate store. It's not worth it.",1620234660,1620234660,False,48,5,0.732858836650848389,0,True,False,False

And when I say that, I mean it. Not even to hardcore racing fans. Go get Assetto Corsa or ACC or PC2 or Dirt or any other number of racing simulators, if you're looking to spend more than $10 on a game. RF2's interface is borderline unusable for the first 20 minutes or so until you've figured it out. The base game content is thin. There's about 2 hours of content here at best. Sadly, the game downloads from a launcher, so you'll be well past the refund window by the time you're able to play (I had four and half hours of playtime from downloading, and had never actually launched the full game until today).

Learning the cars is rewarding, but there aren't many cars. Driving the tracks is a blast, but the track selection is mediocre (no Nurburgring, no Le Mans, no VIR, no Brands Hatch, no Hockenheim, no Sebring, et cetera). Granted, this is the only game I've played where I can crash a 60's F1 car through the haybales and into the bay at Monaco, but that doesn't really make up for how *lacking* the content here is. It seems like the cars and tracks in screenshots from the store page aren't available - I don't have any Ferrari's or Bentleys in my car selection, nor do I have the Nurburgring or Spa - and tracks cost $15 a pop. 

If it hadn't been months (or maybe closer to a year) since I first bought it, i'd be calling steam support and fighting for a refund. But I've got the game now, so I'll probably spend a few more hours playing with it.

If you can get this game on sale - for $10 or less - it does have some incredible physics modelling (as many have said, one of the best), and wheels go flying off when you crash. The game seems to be best for fans of *older* cars, particularly 60's-90's Formula-style legends. You immediately get a sense of the scale of the car you're in (something I think is lacking in virtually every other racing game). Hop in a Brabham and you'll immediately realize just how small the cockpit is thanks to the fact that you start looking at a human standing just outside, waving you out of the pits. Then you step on the gas pedal, realize that the car is turning itself, and then spend fifteen minutes in a UI that *must* have been designed by a masochist figuring out how to stop the game from steering and braking for you.

I think the one thing truly lacking now, is a better multiplayer. It is now easier than ever to join a multiplayer race, and while the experience has improved in my opinion, there are still a lot hiccups, of which particularly, drivers who visibly don't have a clue about the rules of racing.

I'm not going to mention stuff like ratings, gran turismo or acc have implemented them and they have already showed that these are not enough. I think, that making some kind of racing school to teach the basic rules like blue flags, blocking, how to drive on qualifying outlaps, etc... would be a really good thing to add in the simulation.

As simulation goes, it's by far the best I've played with (among Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, Automobilista 2, RaceRoom, Project Cars 2). The FFB is so good that car feels alive: it is an absolute pleasure to drive. You can feel every small track imperfection, loss of grip or tyre damage.

The bundled content is just OK: not as extensive as AC, R3E or PC2, not as consistent and polished as ACC. DLCs are very well done, but rather expensive (some cost more than the game itself - currently at £25.79):
 - £28.82 Formula E Bundle - 2 cars, 4 tracks
 - £27.50 GT3 Bundle - 11 cars
 - £19.25 Endurance Bundle  - 7 cars
 - £22.54 Track Expansion - 4 tracks
Community content and mods are not as good as in AC, but there are some really good cars (Apex Modding FIA GT3 2012, Endurance Series, Flat6 Series, ...) and tracks (Brands Hatch, Donington Park, ...).

3D graphics again is just OK, and worse among all 6 games.

The gameplay is just appalling:
 - The new UI might look nicer, but it's even less usable than the previous one and not as good as in ACC or PC2. The HUD could really benefit from some good mods, or from being updated by Studio 397.
 - Joining a multiplayer session is appalling: it's not possible to know what content is needed before joining, or even to stop the game from downloading it once joining!
 - Hosting a multiplayer session requires a lot of reading, trial and error.
 - The Competition System brings nothing much, as the multiplayer experience is absolutely shocking.
 - AI is rather terrible.

While racing, yeah it's nice, can't complain here, but I also can't really say it feels better than AMS2.
Especially my motion sim doesn't seem to like the rFactor telemetry all that much

Now, because I've used nearly 2 hours to get started, I don't really know if I want to continue, or refund this game.

Then even if the game isn't pretty it shouldn't be too much of a hassle ?

Well, that's too good to be true.

The first thing that shocked me the most was the HORRIBLE interface, nothing had any kind of sense. No like literally, it took me at least 10 good minutes to know how to select a map and a car, only to play singleplayer. Also, don't forget to add at least 5 minutes of intense loading with an Intel Core i7 7700k.

Then I try to drive with my steering wheel, mapping some buttons on my keyboard like ignition and starter; nothing works. It then took me at least 45 good minutes and 25 Google Chrome tabs to finally be able to use my wheel on the game.

I'm not too picky when coming to graphics, I still play very old games like CS 1.6, SWAT 4, San Andreas etc etc, but here I just couldn't drive, like it felt I needed to focus on every pixel of my screen to distinguish a turn. I'm playing on Ultra; 1440p 144hz and I just felt like playing Krunker.io

I'm looking out on youtube and the game doesn't look bad at all, but only for PAID content. Here's my major consern; why is this game trying to have an iRacing like economy system. Seriously, like 11 euros for a track ? I wouldn't mind paying 30 euros for 12 GT3 cars (and I even think it's a bit expensive, but I wouldn't mind too much because they are high quality), but 11 euros for a SINGLE lonely track ?

For comparaison, you can have the laser scanned Nordschleife in his three layouts with 10 additional cars provided in the pack for 7 euros retail price on Assetto Corsa. You could even get the ultimate edition for 15 euros (base game + all dlcs) on sale or on other platforms.

It's actually so frustrating because it could be a much better game because of its physics, FFB and VR performances.

RF2 Pros:
- Best FFB and physics
- Very good VR implementation IMO, if compared to ACC and AC
- Graphics are far from the best, but not bad either
- Great mods from a very dedicated and talented community
- Promising road map from the dev team with regular updates
- Competition system (under development, but promising based on its road map and feedback from the the community)

RF2 Cons:
- Hop in multiplayer lobbies are close to non existent. League racing is required for some Multiplayer experience. (This is the main con in my opinion, however it will improve a lot in the near future as soon as the competition system is mature and fully developed!)
- Not easy and friendly to setup as a ""first sim"". It might require some time digging forums and asking around for help
- Setting up a dedicated server is very complex
- Audio quality/details is not on par with other sims such as iRacing, ACC and AC. There is  a lot of room for improvements IMO


Other than RF2 I play ACC, AC and iRacing (probably around 300h on each at the moment)
Since I discovered RF2 like a year ago, I just cant go back to iRacing. I renew my sub for  a month, join a few races, after some snap overteer and those slides of death that there is  no way you can catch them other than ""counter steer"" into the slide (????) to have some chance of saving, i quit... frustrated for having to be forced to drive like a grandma behind the wheel.

ACC is the one sim that is overalls more complete in my opinion, at this point. Great FFB and physics, quite good populated multiplayer ""just hop in"" races, with quite good fair close racing, not free from some stupid people, of course, but overalls really good for a sit down and race when you have some free time.

AC I have been rarely playing lately. Sometimes I hop in for driving some of its road cars only.

Ive been a huge fan of the first one, and this one is simply amazing, but sadly there is a lot to improve. 

The UI is REALLY bad, and it was upgraded not long ago.
Its really hard to get custom skins working in rfactor2, pretty much like everthing else. 
The workshop mods in the other had make it easy to get new stuff into the game, and the laser scanned tracks are out of this world. 

The graphics arent that amazing but I am okey with that.
I think they are also working on a Rating and Safety rating like iRacing, but still a long way to go.

+ Force feedback
+ Amount of free content
+ Paid content is amazing
+ Laser scanned tracks 
+ Tools to change drivers for endurance races
+ Rain, 24h races

While there isn't as much user-generated content as was found in the original, there is plenty in the Steam workshop to get your teeth into. In particular, Jim Pearson's Isle of Man TT course has been converted from Grand Prix Legends (impressively), as has the Targa Florio circuit. The usual variety is there, race 1990s F1 cars at Bristol Motor Speedway if you like, or hustle a stock car round Monaco.

There are some very big gripes. The paid-for DLC seems overpriced compared to the add-ons for other sims. And if the interface in the original rFactor was bad, the one in rFactor 2 is worse. Amazingly they seem to have introduced a game-breaking interface update in the past few months, I could only get the thing to run by reverting to a beta of the old interface. When you first load the game you have to wait an age for circuits and cars to be downloaded - try to start a race before twenty or so GB is downloaded and you'll crash straight to desktop.

I had to search a couple of forums to find out what I was doing wrong. It would appear that a large percentage of players don't bother to do even that - my first in game award, for sitting behind the wheel of a car, has only been completed by 93.3% of players.

iRacing has the same idea of physically modeling the tire but think about it as a worst implementation of the tire model than RF2. Besides iRacing costs a ton of money and a subscription method of payment!! iRacing is better if you want to play online though. 

The Development Team is still working magic on the game even though its an old game. 

The graphics and car models are up to modern standards, there are also mods that you could use to alter the look of the game further (by switching filters or adjusting the color tones up to your liking after installing a free mod). 

Multiplayer and UI need further development (which the developers have in mind and are actually working on).

I really want to love rFactor 2. but I absolutely hate it for what it is at the moment. It screams laziness and mediocrity, and the sad part of it all is that beneath that coat of failure one can truly acknowledge what a great simulation this is.

edit: after giving the game another chance, tolerating the atrocious performance, I cannot rebind anything without the game freezing without repair... 


After tweaking A LOT of the player.json, Nvidia panel settings, in-game settings, Throttlestop, etc., I managed to (mostly) achieve a consistent experience. After much consideration, I asked myself: would I have spent so many hours tweaking a game's settings to be able to play it? given the fact that the answer was an echo-filled ""No"", I brought myself to recommend this game. All things considered, it is in fact the most grounded simulation, and even with its absolutely atrocious business model, the complex and unfriendly requirement of Gimp or Photoshop to edit liveries, its lack of consumer-friendly UI and performance, the surreal loading times even whilst using an SSD, I still believe that a single mixed race with the LMP2 and GTE cars around Le Mans will continue to give me a better overall experience than any other game I have ever played.

I run an I7 7700k plus a GTX 1060 6GB and i get a smooth 45ASW using my Rift CV1 so users with better hardware will be able to crank up the visuals much higher than my medium settings and get a very nice image . Much like iRacing it doesnt go over the top with post processing which is a positive (See ACC terrible VR performance as comparison)

But let me get on to the sim .  Its got massive mod support just lke AC always has . The workshop is easy to use , as is the installation of mods .  The new UI apparently is better but it doesnt work in openVR so I use the old UI branch in the library options.  The classic UI experience is old school but dont let that bother you too much as soon your wheel is going to feel amazing once your on track.


Many talk about the physics but what they are really meaning is the force feed back .  This sim has had much more detailed tyre and suspension physics than most for many years and many have caught up or are darn close so lets not talk about that. Lets talk about how it feels when your racing cars at speed.  More than any other sim this has the best feeling of a car connected to the asphalt than any other sim on the market.  Your wheel feels like its had a free upgrade to a tier above its grade.  You can tell why real racing factories use the Pro version of rFactor as soon as you play this commercial version.

How they have done it is unknown, but the way the wheels FFB behaves is sublime. The translation of tyre forces into my basic wheel (Thrustmaster TX/300) is like nothing Ive experienced. The FFB design is amazing.

If youre already into other sims all means play your regular sims but consider this one. The base price (£25 UK pounds as I write this)  gives you decent content but there is a massive amount of free ""DLC"" in the workshop so for that base price this sim is more than worth it. Rfactor 2 official DLC isnt cheap but it is made by the best . The Endu pack plus the Endu cars+ GT3 series packs is a must but it will cost a fair bit.


Its not a pick up and play with the online part, as its mostly community based (locked servers) so you need to find those communities to register racing with them (check simracing subredit).  This sim is like a sunny weekend ,you lift the sheet from your sports car you keep in your garage and you take it out for a super driving experience that you dont get with your regular vehicles traversing to work every day. This ride is just you and your sports car. Heaven.  

If in doubt try the demo just to see how good the FFB is . I dont know what patch stage the demo is at so It may be a bit behind as they have updated this sim a lot and still continue to but you will get a good idea how different and more FFB info you never knew a sim wheel could do under the hood due to this games engineering.

These are the reasons why I cannot recommend the game in it's state:

- The UI: It's been common feedback for rF2 for ages and they took this on board to refresh and I assume make it more modern. The new UI however has ended up even more inconsistent and clunky. It's taken what feels years for them to ultimately take a step backwards. For new players I can only see it being frustrating to navigate. The UI honestly feels like it was designed for a touch screen. Completely missed the mark.
- Online presence: The rF2 community is a very exclusive one - probably the most exclusive I've come across in the sim racing community. This results in it not being the kind of game you can put down and pick up when you want, and for the masses would confine them to offline only play. The majority of active servers are exclusive password protected ones.
- New competition mode requires DLC: If you wanted to play in a less exclusive community then the new competition mode opens this up. The reason I cannot recommend it is because it just feels like another way to sell DLC from the get-go. I expected this, but expected that for the first 2 months or so that it would be based on the base game.

I'd buy this game on some very specific recommendations:

- You enjoy offline play and making your own career mode. This game has an excellent modding community and workshop support. There's tonnes of free content spanning decades of motorsport.
- You really want to get into sim racing and can invest hours in joining an exclusive community. This has a die-hard following of true motorsport fans.",1610878167,1610878167,False,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

I cannot stress enough how stunning the driving is, and also how annoying the overall experience can be as you figure out the game's limitations. Let me start with the negatives that I think are a little less documented. There are other negatives not listed here, but they are pretty well covered already by others. Ultimately, all of the negatives are drowned out by how good the driving is, but if you are aware of these sticking points ahead of time you may have a better experience when first starting with the game.

If you're a VR player figuring out how to launch the game in VR is a little frustrating with the custom and ghetto separate application you have to launch to make the graphics changes. Hardly intuitive. It would have been a whole lot nicer if they integrated with steam, as many games do, to provide the option to launch in VR when the game is launched.

The vanilla game without any DLCs or workshop mods is pretty light on content. Not a lot of tracks, not a lot of cars. Thankfully since they integrated with the steam workshop it's pretty easy to go find that famous track you want to race. However, overall there just isn't a lot of mod content, and much of it is pretty focused on purpose-built race cars, not a lot of production road cars. There are some historic race cars but this content is pretty light as well. Nothing in comparison to Assetto Corsa.

Of the cars this game has, more so than any other sim I have played, usually the default setup is complete and total garbage. I suspect there are a ton of people who buy this game, pick one of the cars (vanilla or mod it's generally the same), get out onto the track and find out the thing is barely controllable at speed. So they jump into another car, maybe even try another track, and you know what, same problem. The car is just hopelessly unstable when picking up the pace. I suspect this is the game's biggest barrier to entry, and probably causes many users to try it and put it aside.

The vast majority of the cars I try have some incredibly bad handling characteristics with the default setup. So bad that they would not be desirable on any track, for any reason, and then when you go look at them to start with at least making the car stable you can see why. Many of the cars have just simple middle of road settings for things like the spring rates, and dampers, and omg even the differential; as in, literally the middle of their adjustable range. You see immediately that there wasn't even a basic attempt to give the car a reasonable setup. Probably the thinking is - hey, it's a race car, you need to tune the setup for the track anyway dummy - and yea that's absolutely true if you really want to squeeze everything you can out of the car, but it's a pretty big hurdle for a newcomer. I mean now you're basically asking everyone out there who wants to play this game to have at least a basic understanding of how to tune a car suspension and drivetrain. Those are pretty high expectations. Don't get me wrong, there are some cars that have a reasonable default setup but I find this to be the exception and not the rule. Overall message here is if you are struggling with a car, and you will, look at the setup it's probably terrible.

If you are a lover of h-pattern shifters you are kind of out of luck with rfactor 2, since the transmission model is pretty simplified, and also because there are very few cars available that have an h-pattern. So not only does it not simulate an h-pattern manual very well, there aren't many car choices either. You can bind the individual gears to your shifter and just use it anyway, it's just not very immersive this way. Most of the cars in this game use paddles or are sequential.

The UI is still painful to navigate, even after the update, and especially in VR. I do an absurd amount of clicking up and down through menus just to change the track and car and then get started. Things are at least to some degree logically grouped, but there was very little sensible thought given on where to put game options to minimize your navigation. In VR it's doubly painful. They take the same game window and just expand it so it's like 5 feet away from your face on a movie theater sized screen. You are literally looking all up-down-and-around to make some basic game changes. Luckily you spend most of your time driving anyway :-)

All that being said, for fans of sim racing this game is an absolute must have. I don't have that much play time yet but even this far in it has dethroned every other sim racer I have played in terms of driving experience. Definitely should have tried this game sooner. Each sim has it's own niche for sure, but for sheer driving joy rfactor 2 is really hard to beat.",1609717313,1609717313,True,5,0,0.576258718967437744,0,True,False,False

RFactor 2 does tick all the boxes for me. 
It seems to have great physics (I am not a pilot or anything, so not sure how reliable would be my opinion), great FFB and better VR support than both.
The graphic quality is not as good as ACC, but ACC in VR is a nightmare so I was very frustrated most of the time and wasn't really enjoying the quality.

RFactor 2 uses Steam workshop to handle the mods in most cases, so you don't have to manually download or use something like Content Manager in AC.

The old ui is pretty dated but very reliable. The new UI is nice but there are still things to be fixed in order to migrate completely.

All things considered, I believe I will keep playing RFactor 2 as my new main sim for a long time and the prospect for 2021 in terms of content and improvements is promising.

I really think that this game is underated if you compare to the direct competitors and if you are planning to start siming or looking for something different, RFactor 2 is a really strong contender.

Word of warning is that somethings things that you take for granted in other sims, are not that easy in RFactor.

There's also a lot of content available and I haven't experienced any issues with the Steam Workshop yet.

And the negatives? People have been complaining about the UI for a long time. Well, there's a new one now. Don't really have an opinion yet on that. I can say this though: If you want to create your own championship or just play with hand-picked AI or mixed cars - you're in for a world of pain.

The graphics are decent and they continue improving the visual experience with some monthly updates. The cars drive amazing and all are well modeled but.......Oh yeah !! There is always a ""but"" in everything.

My complaints:

1. The new UI as default
Dear developers....please stop messing with the UI cuz' you don't know what you're doing and every update you release to improve you are making the UI worst. It's 2020 and you know this is the worst year ever since WWII so please don't make it worst.

2. The Online
Join an online section in this game is a pain in the pinky after you smashed it accidentally with a hammer. I know the online part is not gonna be changed because all code needs a rewritting. Also in Zandvoort 2020 I was kicked from the server for being the fastest player with two seconds ahead from the rest.

Of course I do !

During the era of the old UI, the multiplayer system was rough to say the least. The worst, bad. This has been kinda fixed with the introduction of the revamped UI. The update has introduced the Competition system. The system works on event basis, meaning that, when a new event is available, it can be raced for a limited amount of time. If you want to join a custom match, you'll have to look through the server browser. It's very difficult to host a server in rFactor 2. Now that I've talked about the multiplayer state of rFactor 2, the following will cover the rest of this game.
The graphics are outdated at this point, but they still look okay. Some tracks look very bland, while others are much better in terms of detail.
I can't give an simple answer for sound, but it should be acceptable.
The physics are very realistic. The tyre model is great as it has high fidelity modeling. The track is dynamic in terms of weather, and it has the Real Road function. Real Road is a mechanic where the track surface becomes covered in rubber the more you drive on the same line.
Force Feedback is something that I have no expertise on, so I'd say that it's good. No real knowledge on this, so it's up for you to rate.
Content out of the box is low on quantity in terms of interesting tracks and cars. There's a lot of open wheelers, two(?) street cars, some cup cars and two karts. The track selection includes some interesting tracks like Zandvoort, Silverstone and Sao Paulo. Other tracks are kinda niche for the standard consumer. They are still fun and offer a lot of challenge. The problem of low amount of tracks and cars can be fixed with mods, however there's an official track selection in the DLC store.
This leads me to one of the big problems of rFactor 2, the DLC. The DLC is very expensive. It's about 5€ for a single car, and for tracks, it's even more. The ones that you are likely to see when you come across the store page, are Circuit De Spa Francorchamps (9€), Nürburgring (12€), Circuit De La Sarthe (11€), Circuit d'Azur (Monaco) (9€) and Sebring (9€). These are the popular ones. And they are quite expensive. That's the current problem with rFactor 2 alongside with hosting a multiplayer server, which is a real hassle. Otherwise, I'd recommend rFactor 2 as a driving experience. To anyone that buys rFactor 2, have fun on your racing journey! To anyone that decides to pass for now, it's fine, you can think more of it.
Peace out.
EDIT (READ THIS): I looked around the community page to see a lot of negative feedback to the new UI. Me being an newer user of rFactor 2 affects my opinion on the new update. I haven't gotten any of my mods or content lost. I am completely fine, but it is understandable if a major error ruins the game for good. Hopefully this explains why I praised rFactor 2 in my review.",1608935089,1608937685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UI is very clunky and unintuitive, despite getting an overhaul a few days ago. The game  lacks time trial mode and leaderboards, which I was shocked by since everyone talked about this game as a go-to sim for time trialers.
Content is scattered all over the place. Default content is not very interesting (very basic cars and tracks). Most of the content 
is on the steam workshop, but quality varies highly. The most popular cars (GT3, LMP ...) and laser scanned tracks (Sebring, Nurburgring, Le Mans ...) have to be purchased from game store, and it gets expensive very quickly.
Controller support is terrible. It is a pain in the ass to set it up in the first place, and even after that it doesn't work properly - doesn't work in menu, sometimes game doesn't register your controller inputs when you start racing, and such..

Thus, you are going to be able to ""feel"" the car and anticipate its actions. All other sims are trying to emulate the feel on rFactor2 so it would be worth buying this. The price right now is a freaking bargain and the amount of contents downloadable for free on steam workshop is as good as high quality titles. 

On the other end of the spectrum, the UI is really hard to navigate. A lot of features are buried within options and are hard to find. Even with the new UI from Studio 397, its still not that user friendly. I'm very hopefull with the roadmap from Studio 397 as there will be more features and corrections to be done in the near future. 

The new competitive and ranked system newly introduced needs more explanations. I'm also wondering when and how is the safety rating going to be implemented. Hopefully there will be more updates to clarify things.

S397 took on the project some years ago now though and it's certainly been coming a long way from the ISI days. However, usability for those of us who would rather race against people, rather than just AI, is still somewhat a pain in the ass due to the infrastructure supporting MP features as well as the UI. In fact, the UI overall itself is quite overdue with S397 now working on it for at least 2 years now. 

Still, putting that aside, the simulation is what matters right? As with any simulator, it's about how it feels rather than how it looks. Rfactor 2 looks quite nice actually, if you have a machine that allows you to crank up those ""pretty"" knobs. But the simulation is definitely one of the best, if not THE best i've come across.

The feel of the drive is second to none, when it comes to the amount of information that is fed through a wheel, with the tyre model still being one of the best on the track racing sim scene, even after all these years. Rfactor 2 is always the sim that gives me the chance to make quite comprehensive informed decisions in both driving and setup. I'm not at all saying that other sims don't, but i definitely never feel as confident in my decisions in other products. 

The AI can be ruthless, which is great, but sometimes a little unbelievable. The AI enjoy randomly stabbing the brake through a corner for example. It makes it really hard to practice how to really race other cars when the AI does silly things like that. But they are competitive and they definitely make you aware that they know you are present on the track. 

Add everything that i've just said to the HUGE amount of community made/free content for the sim, a good amount of official payware (not overly priced either i might add) and the community activity when it comes to leagues and you have yourself a really great high fidelity simulation that support any hardware i've thrown at it, including VR, and just put a smile on my face everytime.

When I started playing it a few years ago, RF2 performed bad, looked bad, had great physics, and had great AI.
These days, RF2 looks good, the performance has improved (except loading times; they're very slow compared to other sims), the physics are great, but the AI isn't a good as it used to be (for example: AI spins a lot at Sebring).
Things I don't like about RF2:

[list]
[*]Physics and FFB are good
[*]Looks good
[*]Some really good DLC tracks (Sebring, the Reiza pack, etc) and cars (GT3, GTE, McLaren Senna GTR, etc)
[*]A lot of mods are available.
[/list]

Things I don't like about RF2:
[list]
[*]The UI is painful to use. They're working on a new one. Maybe it'll be done sometime soon?
[*]The DLC is kind of expensive compared to others (RRRE and AMS2).
[*]I don't like how you have to buy the DLC in order to race against cars. Example: I prefer RRRE's approach where you just need to buy the DLC in order to drive a car, not to race against it.
[*]No track map. A track map isn't realistic, but neither is jumping between multiple tracks every couple of minutes.
[*]It annoys me when AI crashes/spins often when using official content (such as GT3/GTE/LMP2 at Sebring)

It's a flawed gem. It certainly takes effort to deal with it's old jankiness, but if you can deal with some jank and frustration to get the best damn racing experience available on PC, then it's worth every penny.

The handling & FFB on a wheel is top of all the current sims.
The graphics on the newer tracks like Le Mans & the Nurburgring are stunning with a Rift S ( can't wait to see them on a Reverb G2).
The DLC's are reasonably priced that you actually own unlike another sim iRacing, which has the same tracks but they don't look anywhere near as good.
R Factor 2 is more focused on Endurance-GT racing which is perfect for me but they do have Formula E too.
The free workshop content covers a lot more championships & Tracks, some are good enough to be paid content, try some of the old school F1 cars for a real test.
The one thing that would make R Factor2 the best all round sim is a much improved multiplayer, there are multiplayer events  available but there are too many issues with trying to join and the content not being available, some of these are available in the Workshop or you may need all the DLC cars in that event even if you don't intend to use them. it just doesn't look very polished when you 1st start. 
Races against the AI are good but it does have some issues, In a multiclass event the LMP2 cars will sit behind a GTE when they should easily get past.

When the game finally did load the console was also looking to be very outdated - lots of stuff, but confusing and looking like something from the early 90's, something that wasn't using available video drivers?    The console IMO is the worse I have ever seen,  I attempted to switch vehicles for test drive finally giving up and just running with the Corvette they had as default WHY NOT?  At this point the game possible took 10 minutes to load - the entire time I was thinking my play clock time was stacking up and Steam would be counting this as play time for sure.  When it finally 
popped up the graphics again not looking to be using video card drivers more like windows in safe mode or something then it was not responding to the controller at all.  If it could be fixed surely it would take some tweaking and more play time logged I was finished.  My computer is about one year old - High end Alienware factory everything so?  IDK?  I wouldn't be

Theres lots of mods in the workshop and mods on other web sites
Track mods are pretty cool
The handling feels like a true race car!
Simulate Rain races and even 24hrs too!

CONS: the penalty system which can be turned on, off or reduced can be brutal

Some of the highlights track wise is Nurburgring, Le Mans, Imola, Silverstone and Sebring. So I can see this being a great tool for any who is a sim racer but also considering a career in motorsport for a training tool.

The Force feedback is perhaps one of the best I've ever experienced and I'm using a Thrustmaster TMX with T3PA peddles, I can only imagine what this game would feel like on a direct Drive wheel base.

Word of warning though, Make sure to make use of the free Demo that comes with the game to make 100% sure you enjoy it.

This is the most fun I've ever had in any Racing sim period. I can't get enough of the responsiveness and overall feel of the driving in this sim. Never been a road racing fan but this one might turn me.

Pros:
- Insane physics that should please any sim racing fan
- Great community support with free laser scanned tracks and a handful of great cars
- Seemingly frequent content updates from the developers
- No-frills

Cons:
- The barrier of entry is just to high compared to other sims
- Multiplayer: Bugs, exploits, hard to setup
- Very old UI
- The sound engine feels a bit dated

As of right now based on some recent interviews it seems the devs are about to hammer out some of the cons.

Audio: Needs work but in general the audio is good 3.5/5
Graphics: Like the audio the graphics need some love and attention, the new dev is currently working on this and also more content so it looks promising for the future. currently i rate them at a 3.5/5
Physics: The best on the market by far, however it took me a while to get my settings perfect. Now it feels better than iRacing. (min force feedback was my issue) 5/5
Gameplay: The AI leaves much to be desired, it's very finicky to get the setting just right for your skill level. They always feel too fast or too slow. A lack of a proper championship mode is a huge gripe of mine also. League racing is great as long as the track has no fps issues. 3/5

I will come back to this review at some stage after the dx11 implementation has been complete but for now i will rate this game at 15/20 - Must buy for any sim racer who wants the ultimate feeling racing sim!

Edit: 3 years later and it's still much of the same game , better fps now but still no competition mode like iracing or raceroom or even sim racing system.

I have, but I prefer to sit down and have a few races against the AI every once in a while....not too serious about it all. What I AM serious about is how the games work.....how the cars handle. How the tracks look and is the AI realistic enough to have some fun racing against them. 

SO I previously owner the original rFactor and loved that game. Still own it. I enjoyed downloading new tracks and especially the mods that included specific cars. One in particular I really liked was the V* SuperCars. That mod was amazing. 

Re rFactor 2, I've only just started playing it again after playing many other racing games. I'm better at setting up my cars and just having fun, although it DOES take more work in rFactor than it does in a game like GRID, for example. There are some things that kind of get in the way sometimes.  For example, I went out for practice and the car would shift past a certain point. Turns out that the speed limiter was on by default for some odd reason. But once you get that stuff figured out, the game can be as much fun as you make it.
Probably my favorite thing about this game is that you can set the AI abilities in fine increments. Unlike in a game like GRID, where you can set your difficulty to low, medium, hard and harder, or something similar, and I found that the difference between the normal setting and hard it huge. SO in rFactor, I can fine tune that so that the AI give me as hard a race as I can handle. 
BTW, I use an old wired XBOX 360 controller, not a wheel. 

So year, I recommend this game. You can play is sort of like an arcade style (but no crazy crashes) or full SIM.",1602794384,1602794384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

UPDATE
So we are a couple of months further and I must say RF2 changed a lot since then. Especially after the update of last June 2020. The sounds are way better. (they shot the seal on the back seat I think) Also the updated tracks look awesome and realistic. I still do not recommand the older cars, but the DLC ones are updated and look, sound and drive like they should do.

A racing simulator that can provide sublime driving experiences with the right car and track combinations.  Then at other times is frustrating and confusing due to bugs or confusing UI structure.

Multiplayer is only an option if you play in organized clubs or leagues.  Otherwise  this is mostly a single player experience with AI (who do a good job overall).

Maybe not recommended as your [i]first[/i] racing sim to get, but definitely as a follow-up game after you tried something else, e.g. Assetto Corsa or Project Cars 2.  If you get this game, be patient, don't judge it too quickly.  The driving is worth some of the frustrations you encounter.

Complaining about this game is a sport to itself in the sim racing community.  For me the driving experience is worth the frustrations, and I appreciate S397 staying loyal to the game with regular updates and some free content alongside paid DLC.


[h1]Positive[/h1]

[b]A satisfying driving experience[/b] - there's a lively, organic feel to the cars from the physics engine in this game, that is hard to match elsewhere.  The cars feel natural and responsive with quite a range of types across open wheel, touring cars, GT3, etc.

[b]Force feedback[/b] - also feels very good with minimal configuration options.  Communicates well even on a cheap wheel (G29) with overloading the wheel.

[b]Good range of content[/b] - covers a lot of car and tracks if you include official and mod content.  And a mix of well-known and more niche content.  

[b]Mod support[/b] - plenty of content to be found in the Steam workshop or in other places on the internet.  This helps fills out the range of content.  Quality varies but there is plenty of good content.

[b]AI[/b] - RF2 AI has some racing instincts coded into it that makes it one of the better AIs for single player racing.  The AI is quite adept at overtaking and exploiting your hesitations on track.  It can also drive a defensive line to prevent you taking the inside line.  However on some tracks and some situations the AI lose their cool and can crash and mess up a race.

[b]Regular updates[/b] - the developers continue to make improvements to the game engine and bring additional free and paid DLC content.  Not many sims give free track updates years after initial release so well done S397.

[b]High quality DLC[/b] - I've really enjoyed the paid DLC tracks and cars I've tried and been impressed with its quality.  For example the Ferrari 488 GTE car or Sebring track with night lighting effects, really good.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]

[b]Overall polish[/b] - this is more like a sand box sim than a normal game.  The UI doesn't make a good first impression, and is not as slick and easy to navigate as other titles like PC2.  Too many things rely on keystrokes that you have to bind and learn.  No user manual.

[b]Slow loading[/b] - launching the game or launching race sessions takes longer than most other racing games.

[b]Limited game modes[/b] - there are currently no campaign or championships races, no hotlaps with records, etc.

[b]UI[/b] - the classic UI has various usability issues that make it a pain.  For example after choosing your car to choose the AI cars you just have a cryptic text window where you have to guess what abbreviations will insert what cars in your race.  There is a new UI in beta which looks nicer but inherits many of the problems from the classic UI.  Eventually you just get used to it.

[b]AI car crashes[/b] - in some AI races things can get chaotic at the start with pile ups as the AI seems to struggle with certain corners or knock each other off track.  Can spoil some race combinations.  Rolling starts also sometimes confuse the AI and the fast rolling start is [i]too[/i] fast as it jumps to a few seconds before green.

[b]Ancient content[/b] - the game has been out a long time and some of the content you install might be old and maybe not so good.  Some the cars may look and drive strange.  Some tracks were not updated as the game evolved and now look bad.  To keep in mind you will come across such stuff as you try out various content.",1562873809,1601315939,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

What do you buy, when you buy rFactor 2? You buy a great engine, but the free content that comes with it, is not so great, and doesn't do it justice. In fact, I've unsubscribed from probably 95% of the content the sim came with.

Available content varies greatly in quality, both graphically, and simulation wise.

There is very good content out there, both paid, and free, but you need to know what to get, and where to get it (ask around). Which is a major problem in my opinion. But once you do, it is fantastic. No other racing sim bring me so much pure driving joy as rFactor 2.

For those wondering; it is not unplayable with a gamepad, but I would say that out of all the racing sims it is the least playable with a gamepad, and is much better with a wheel. And yes, the interface is ugly, it's not bad, but not great either. Things are a little clunky (from settings to any sort of customisation, mods etc.), but once you know how it works, it works well.

For the sheer emotions this is just unbeatable for me which will always outweigh its Flaws.

Later had a blast with GT on my PS. I've also played some arcade-y game on my Android tablet, which was OK, but it's a tablet... so after a lifetime of dabbling, I decided to jump in head-first to a more serious level of racing ""game"" with RFactor2. This review is my first impressions.

I love how realistic everything is. The simulation aspects of this seem spot on to me (not that I'm remotely qualified to judge this). I've been playing using an XBox style gamepad and while it's not great, it is very playable once you dial in the steering a bit and set up accel/brakes, shifters, etc to work with your own style in the game. I find the graphics to be more than acceptable, it's the driving experience that's critical.

In that area, I think I'm going to have to upgrade to a force-feedback racing wheel because there's just too much going on for the gamepad. I've got analog triggers for accel and brakes, and shoulder buttons work nice as shift paddles, but thumb steering on an analog stick is just a bit goofy, especially since you end up trying to do way too much stuff with just four fingers and the thumbs. It works, but I think it would be more appropriate to an arcade game rather than RF2.

So far the only thing that's really hard for me to love about this game is the lack of a guided introduction experience (like GT's license system where you have to practice and become capable with certain skills before moving up to more serious cars). RF2 is extremely hardcore and basically seems to assume you know what you're doing from the outset. I'm glad I don't have to grind like mad to unlock features of a game I paid for, so I don't miss that aspect, but it's a little weird to be able to jump right into a high end Formula car and barrel out of the pits at 100+MPH.

I'd complain about the fact that there aren't showrooms full of officially licensed vehicles from every major manufacturer in racing history, but there's a very healthy mod scene for RF2 that looks like it fills in a lot of the gaps. There's also plenty of paid DLC out there that I've haven't gotten yet. It's nice not to have to shell out $50-$60 to get started.

The mods available for it are the cherry on top - some of my favorite pieces of content, including the Flat6 cars and CTMP, are mods. Of course, other sims do other things better - AMS2 is arguably a better all-rounder, AC has better mods and a better UI (with Content Manager), PC2 has a much wider variety of official content and the graphics edge, RaceRoom has better sounds and other types of content (DTM), and iRacing is far better for multiplayer.

I find the DLC prices are quite reasonable. I have no issues paying for professional products (and have purchased tracks and cars from other modders as well).

Well... I don't understand how so many people praise this title as the best sim especially for FFB and physics. 
I tried several tracks with a Ferrari mod and Porsche 991 GTE on silverstone and spa where I think know well enough through pC2, AC or ACC.

I love this game, property involved, very addictive. The laser scanned version of the Nordschleife is an absolute work of art. I'm currently loving the Porsche 911 RSR GTE, what a beast.

[EDIT 05-Jul-2020]
OK - What can I say, I still LOVE this game. I got a bit frustrated and put around 100 hrs into ACC but got frustrated with how stringent ACC is with regards to pit stops etc, so I went back to rF2. And, ohh man, as soon as I got in the seat it hit me how much fun it was to race in this sim. Absolutely glorious!!

There are things wrong with it, yeah.

The UI needs work, even the Beta UI, which IMO is better, still needs work.
There is still stuff that can be changed in a '.json' file which you can't do in the UI.

I still need rF2 Log Analyser to keep track of custom championships.

But...Le Man, Nurburgring GP, Nordschelife, Silverstone, Sebring; the Endurance Pack...COME ON!

I'm still loving the Porsche 911 RSR GTE, best car for me.

If you buy it, be prepared to tinker and learn, and be patient.

I haven't played a racing sim that feels as natural and realistic as rFactor 2 (and I own most of the major titles).  I hate any sort of computer control to correct my pathetic driving technique, but I find that many racing sims can often behave like dogs in socks on ice, when all driving aids are off.  With the latest updates, rFactor 2 has really surpassed many of the other titles i regularly play, in terms of its feedback and sense of being in control of the car.  I feel like i can finally tell what the tyres are doing when cornering, when I'm about to lose it, and when I do, that I actually have a chance of catching a slide.

- Great physics
- Mod content via Steam Workshop (tons of cars and tracks)
- Easy to get into VR support (easier with Beta UI)
- Great Force Feedback
- Beta UI is pleasing

Cons:
- Pricey DLC
- Very difficult to tell what DLC you own from the steam shop this are using
- Online racing will lock you in to leagues. Won't have much luck in drop in races.
- Very difficult to host servers
- All players have to own all DLC cars that is used by the server. Even if they do not use that car, they will be required to use it.

I really enjoyed my time with rFactor2, it is a great racing game. But at this point, I just use it to test out content that I want to buy in iRacing now (tracks). I don't see this game taking off the way people want it to until a ranking system is added, not requiring everyone to own all cars on the server, and some kind of scheduling system to join races. Wait.... did I just describe iRacing?

You may think it is funny that I'm saying the DLC is pricey when I play iRacing where evere track or car is around $15. And for sure, rFactors2 DLC cheap from that mindset. However, the items I just listed above is what makes paying those premium prices worth it to play iRacing over rFactor2. It not fair for rFactor2 to price tracks the same way iRacing does when I can only race that track once every six months (league will likely only race the track once per season). The car prices are high in comparison to games it should be pitted up against on price (AC for example).

If you want a great racing game and don't care about online at all, rFactor2 is great. If you catch a sale, usually 50% off, that's the time to buy the car packs. Even the modded content is great! You don't have to spend a cent there. $16 (when the base game is on sale) is a lot of bang for your buck there.

However, if you're like me and want to play online you'll need the DLC as most leagues will run with official content. With no ranking system and my trash skills, I was no match for anyone and learned nothing. So I caved, bought iRacing, got put in with other Rookies and learned how to drive cause I could race daily with other people. It's a high price to pay though... pick your poison....

I'm saying I do not recommend this game as I'm an online racer. This game has to many obstacles to overcome to play with other racers.

So now with that out of the way, it is also worth appreciation the fact that this game hosted the biggest event in simracing history during the 2020 24hr lemans with a mix of professional drivers and simracers operating 200 vehicles on the track. We won’t likely witness the same prestige again, but RF2 was the chosen platform to make that happen. Yes, there was some networking complications, but this was the chosen platform to host such an event.

There is still a regular stream of new content for purchasing, upgrades and fixes to existing content and plenty of free content that Studio 397 provides in the Steam workshop. So if you are still reading this and own a wheel, buy the game already. You should not regret it.

Add on content is pricey but I think the price is warranted because of the level of detail of the cars and tracks.

This is also a great game if you like Formula E, but you'll have to buy a few things like the cars and iirc 3/4 tracks. Most other FE tracks are in the workshop for free but not the best quality.

Pro's:
•Best FFB Feel you'll ever find and I'll stand behind that (from a sim that's 6-7 Years old!!)
•Car physics that actually make sense.
•Again the cars feel right and handle like they should. 
•Not overly complicated to get it setup (Controls/FFB etc..)
•Effects don't feel ""Artificial""
•The community of guys & girls who play this are really good and helpful people and that's honestly a massive + to me.
•The AI are just simply insanely good with the right settings.

Con's
•$31?  No, it's good but it's also 7 years old. Buy it like I did when it's around $16-20
•Graphics aren't aging well (DX11) but some care about that and some don't. I don't care really, but some may care so worth a mention.
•DLC a little pricey $$ (especially for something this old) and I say this because I would love to have it but find out hard to spend $15 on a few GT3's..
•Stock Content: ""Cars/Tracks"" a little meh..but you can download mods. Honestly the GT3's & LMP cars they released not long ago should have been free in my opinion but that's just me. 
•The ""UI"" is pretty bad.. Why on earth it was never updated I have no idea. 

In my opinion the $31 asking price should get you the base game and either all or most of the DLC that was released for it, and honestly 397 studios asking anything over $20 for the base game is what makes me not trust this sim or company a %100 but..
These guys had to put some love into making this because the FFB alone makes anything else just feel weak in comparison.
It's odvious they cared alot about this sim at one point, but at some point something either happened or went wrong and now it feels like they're charging alot of $$$ to the people who are supporting them and trying to keep this sim alive. Alot of people have defended these guys and rightfully so, but to someone like myself who is new to Rfactor 2 and want to be a part of the group that says ""This is maybe one of the best feeling sim's ever made"" I have a hard time suggesting this to people when the base sim is $31+DLC $30-45 more (Which are cars that should be in the sim to begin with) I just can't find myself dropping  $70 for a sim with a very small community/multiplayer and is also as old as this sim is right now. 
Other than the cost I don't have a problem with this sim and honestly I really like it, and wish they were more to bite off and chew with it without having to spend more money.
But, I gotta give them credit.. I've driven full race spec cars in real life and this sim is the closest I've found to simulating that feel.
If realistic is what your after then look no further.


Update: (June 2020)
This is an excellent sim when it comes to the driving and physics don't get me wrong..however
I cannot bring myself to support a sim with a snake like (iRacing) business model that studio 397 has come up with.. I'm highly against sneeky and overpriced business models in sim racing and it;s one of the reasons I started my own small business making sim ""Mod"" Parts like Load cell kits for popular pedals that don't cost $175 for some bargin bin chinese parts in a plastic bag that cost the company less than 5% to buy in bulk, and with that said 397 studios I'm very uneasy with the fact that so many people supported you throughout the years of up and down success with RF2 and paid the full $40-32 price tag and also spent countless hours typing out forum post about how everyone should try RF2 even though it was rough around the edges and you guy's go and not only make the most overpriced DLC I HAVE EVER SEEN NEXT TO iRACING!! but you don't even give out one free car out of hand full of GT3's and LMP's you have... Not one? Not one single free car for the people who bought a sim with very limited content from the git go? 
I'm sorry but that's just fucked up and then you expect us to pay hundreds of dollars for this content!!??
I gladly paid RaceRoom around $165 over a 2 year period and do you wanna know why I DON'T regret that at all? 1. They put the sim out for free 2. They let you TEST DRIVE any cars you want 3. They gave me free cars and tracks to start out with and weren't afraid to have their sim or content judged and set behind a pay wall. I could go on and on but I won't.
You know this is fucked up and even worse you know the sim is dying so your just trying to pry that last bit of money out of your SUPPORTERS POCKETS!!! After all these years are you f*cking kidding me?
It's a nasty and vile way to do business guy's and it doesn't look good on you, and I'm sorry but their is no way in hell those cars and tracks are that good to ask that much for them but I'll never know cause I'll never buy it. Asking a high price is one thing but to simply not hand out not one single free car is just soooo messed up.
I cannot say I'll support this sim anymore and honestly I haven't been cause I'm tired of paying out the Azz to you sim companies who just keep asking for more and more money ALL THE TIME and it seems their will be no end to it. I really hope you open your eye's and take a look around to the people who have supported this train wreck for over 8 years hell not to mention RF1 and give back to the people that gave so much to you.
And one more thing I don't know who's running things over there but after the Le mans event it would have been really smart to give out something to your long time supporters and other people who may have lost interest over the years because I promise you it would have caused a major boom in business if you would have atleast given out a free GT3 and the lemans track as a celebration for the iconic event, but of course you did no such thing.
I'm out of things to say. I'm just really suprised after all this you guys made these decisions to act this way. It's sad.",1566386426,1593043114,False,0,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

For me the force feedback tuning options are very difficult to get right with my Fanatec Podium DD1. But I've read that most wheels work fine with RFactor 2 and that the difficulties and issues with the force feedback tuning options I experienced is only because I use a Fanatec wheel. Despite all the issues I think it has I still love driving on this sim and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for the most realistic feeling sim out right now.

Plus points.

Physics and force feedback are genre leading. The feedback on my Thrustmaster t300rs is amazing.

New content, both tracks and cars, are fantastic. I've recently bought Nordchleife and le mans and although I've spent hardly any time on le mans, nords is the best version I've ever driven in a sim, it's simply breathtaking. Le mans is also very high quality, as no doubt a lot of you will know having watched the virtual 24 hours of le mans race.

I've also purchased the Ferrari 488 GTE and the two strong pack, which includes the Aston Martin Vantage GTE.

Both of these cars are wonderful and I'm having a blast, hot lapping at Nords :)

A.I. is ok, some people moan about it but I don't find it too bad.

Tons of free mods available, both tracks and cars.


Minus points.

""Vanilla"" content is not the best. You really need to add to it with official content, which of course costs more money.
The dlc content is too expensive, in my opinion.
Studio 397 are charging close to iRacing prices for tracks (about 2/3rds as much) but without online servers.
Cars are more reasonably priced but still a tad too expensive.
Tracks should be £7 and cars £3, in my opinion, with discounts given for pack purchases, where available.

Free mods vary massively in quality so some sorting is required.

Online is almost non existent, but there are plenty of leagues that you can join.
I'm not keen on league racing though and much prefer to just turn up and play when I'm available.

Servers are prone to crashing, as what happened on the virtual race of le mans, last weekend.

U.I is vile, even the beta U.I.
They are unintuitive and a pain to use.

Graphics are average, even when dialled up to max.
Yes they look ok, but pop out of scenery in rear view, and half refresh rate reflections, when using bonnet cam are distracting, particularly the half refresh rate reflections. It just makes it look juddery.

The game takes an absolute age to load, in fact it takes so long that you may think it's crashed, it can take several minutes to load in.
When you're in the game and have navigated the awful U.I. then the track takes ages to load as well, again you'll think the program has crashed!

If you're prepared to put up with all this then once in the game you're rewarded with an amazing driving experience, with force feedback and the feel of the physics unmatched anywhere else.

If studio 397 can add some ""spit and polish"" to the u.i. and reduce loading times then it would be a big bonus, but I'm not holding my breath.
They've been working on the u.i. for well over a year!

Paid official content seems to be their priority and while I appreciate that they need to make money, they also really need to sort out these silly little issues, that when added together, will be enough to put some players off.

Personally, I'm glad I gave it another chance and with the dlc that I've recently bought, it's a blast.

Most rudimentary, unfinished user interface, full of dead ends and non-functioning features, fine for commercial driver, but a slap in the face for a consumer/gamer. Pure driving simulator, there's not a bit more to it. Vanilla and outdated content mixing with high-end tracks and cars, incredibly confusing. Very little information on cars and tracks in ui, nothing for the player to learn, no car specs, sparse track descriptions, no leaderboards, no incentives to play. Hard core.
Summary: physics are so good, that it makes up for the other weaknesses.

That said, I've decided to keep the game to support the sim community in some small way and to see how RF2 develops in future. 

Some negatives: It's 2020. One shouldn't have to mess around with configuration files (controller.json for FFB) to get a playable experience. It also fails to recognise my pedals (Heusinkveld Ultimates) whenever I connect a PS4 controller to my PC. No such issue with other sims. 

Some positives: RF2 can provide a very compelling in-car feeling if you spend enough time on tweaking its settings. It also offers a unique set of official tracks and cars in comparison to other sims.

Open calibration, recalibrated controller. Car then doesn't turn at all. 

Calibrated controller again. Started in compatability mode. left at full throttle.

Asked question on forum and was given snotty answers like  'well, you should buy this wheel and then you'd have no problem', 'you are't a proper sim racer unless you have this wheel', 'game is awful with pad, i can't believe people still try to use those'.

2- PHYSICS AND WHEEL FORCE FEEDBACK: Are said to be good and detailed and focused on (almost everyone agrees).  Examples: Tire model stuffed with many details that happen in real life, ability to change suspension, gearing and aerodynamic setup of the car and the last example is a weather and track surface system that tries to simulate many aspects of real life stuff.

3- CONTENT: (Cars and tracks) Are very high quality if you buy DLC or drive the newer free original content done by them. The cars have licence and data from the real manufactures and the tracks are laser scanned to be accurate in layouts, swings, up and down hills, dips and bumps to the millimeter. But unfortunately EXPENSIVE content. 

4- USER EXPERIENCE: Not easy to deal with the menus and features.

5- GRAPHICS AND SOUND: OK but not the best or newest.

6- USER EXPERIENCE: Not made easy for users.

7- COMMUNITY: Friendly serious league racing. Helpful developers.

8- This is a long term project that keeps improving (love this idea or hate it), Hefty engine capable to be improved in the future (unlike other old sims that reached their limitations).

Other titles like Assetto Corsa or Project Cars 2 are great, but the small details that they don't feature makes this sim so special, like rubber buildup and the amazing tyre model.

The same trash that doesn't let you select individual AI. It's basically the same HUD from launch, just rearranged. 

397 can't be bothered giving vehicles proper displays and instead only opt for ""gear"" and ""speed"". Which is fine for a free mod, but we're talking $30 car packs. Devs are up themselves at times and don't like this criticism, fanboys will defend them too.

This sim's pros are handling, mods, paid dlc tracks are laser scanned, done well and overall flexibility. It's okay, but it comes nowhere close how other sims look or offer for much less.

When it comes to my real life experience of racing, rf2 fails to provide proper understeer feedback. But apart from that its a decent sim but definitely not the best.

The car just oversteers regardless of how I set up it to understeer.

However I found out that it was because the controller wasn't calibrated properly and it is very hard to calibrate the controller, I used to have a wheel, but now I only have a pad after moving overseas.

I had to tune the car so it is extreme understeering so its stable, this allowed me to slowly tune my controller so calibrate the feel properly. Then I graduatley setup the car to more balanced, eventually reverted to stock settings which was very balanced for a F1 car. 

WIth the controller setup proeprly even on just a standard controller pad I can feel every single bump and curve, the forcefeedback feels good and can feel nearly every part of the car is very reaslitic. 

But the prolbem with online multiplayer mode is that it takes forever to download the maps and you cann't find their maps on the workshop and download them manually, workshop maps download fairly quick.

Its not overly cheap, and extra official content isnt overly cheap either, but it IS very well done. I initially thought id not bother paying $18 for Lemans or $20 for Nurburgring, but i ended up buying them and it was worth every cent. The quality is beyond compare.

Content wise:
The AI is pretty good, possibly the best on offer in the industry. I can't say for sure since I haven't played every sim title. 
The tracks are hit and miss. The FFB is great. You can really feel the small bumps and crevasses.
The cars are also hit and miss. Except the oval stuff. Don't use rFactor for ovals. Best bet would probably be iracing in my experience. 

The real issue is that unless you are committing to a league, there is not much incentive to pick this sim up. For plug n play casual simmers there is better titles now suited for that.

You want to just race but this game doesn't let you do that, you have to jump through hoops trying to set up a series and there is no preconfigured races in the sim if you can get that  part to even work (mine crashes creating the mas file everytime)

I bought the game 2 days ago and have more time spent trying to get the game to work then I have using it. i played maybe 8 hrs or so not sure. I have spent 16 hours trying to fix it since it had a update the next morning after purchase.

This is not a jump right in and race kind of game  if you are looking for that buy something else.

Physics are great and after tooling with AI settings for every track and car combo you do get the best racing experience. Sadly though you will spend an hour or 2 getting things perfect. I don't have that kind of time to fiddle with things.

Set up well you will be setting everything up, your wheel, the graphics, the AI the tracks, the weather, hoping you know your cars because you will be looking at text to set up your fellow racers! Not all cars go good with all the tracks and you just have to play around wasting time trying to get the ""perfect car track combo""

Also I have been sitting here or over 6 fing hours waiting for the files to validate why? I have no clue I tried to jump on and run a race and it's doing that on it's own.

Where the game shines is its modifiability: For almost every racing class, there is content available. You just have to pick it from STEAM workshop or from websites.
Driving/force feedback feels great to me. Racing against AI if set up correctly is very good. You can even fill up online servers with AI and always race with a full field.
The graphics differ with the mods from OK to good, but more important is the simulated racing and that is a lot of fun in this game.

PRO'S
- The best feeling sim I've ever played.
- Force feedback is really spot on, head and shoulders above anything I've tried
- VERY good physics and handling
- VERY well implemented VR support that doesn't require a mammoth PC to run 
- despite what people say, the UI is actually pretty straight forward
- also despite what people say, the graphics aren't that bad, they are just pretty basic compared to AC or PC2 for example.
- The devs are still putting a lot of work into the game with frequent updates and lots of future content planned.

CON'S
- Can't fully lock camera to horizon in VR. You get used to it after a while but it's annoying
- Base game content is severely lacking variety, however what is there is good and there are plenty of mods to be tried
- Had a bit of trouble setting up my T500rs. Had to set it to the TS-PC profile for it to work after googling it.

If you are a keen sim racer and you are on the fence about this game, you should definitley go for it. Also, if you have tried the demo and thought it was crap, the actual game is so much better... they need to take that demo down or update it because thats a big reason I didn't buy it until now.

First things first, I am absolutely impressed by it.
Like most positive reviews I absolutely feel this has the best force feed back of any driving sim  (although the recent ACC updates are quickly catching up) I have used and I've got a few in my library (feel free to check).
I utilise this sim with the gear below.
Asus MB
i7 6700k
16G RAM
GTX 1080ti
Oculus Rift S
Fanatec Club Sport Wheel and Pedals
For me the immersion in this sim is awesome, I can play in the single player for hours at a time just  trying out the cars and tracks.
I have bought a few DLC and feel the GT3 pack is my favourite and love thrashing the audi and absolutely terrified driving the chevy.
I have found the DX 12 version buggy with graphical errors and cars not loading, however with the vanilla game I have found no issues at all and with graphics up to max it looks more than good enough to provide an immersive experience.
The UI is functional.
The AI is up there with the best I have encountered.
All in all a good experience, dont be put off by buying DLC, buy what you want the game has to be supported somehow. Additionally the workshop community is awesome and I have downloaded cars and tracks for free which has enhanced my purchase and enjoyment of the 'game'.

Basically, the audio is atrocious. Tire screeching sounds like a PS1 Gran Turismo game and the engines, while nice at idle or low RPM, sound underwhelming at high RPM. Even the replays don't sound great. I don't get the sense of fast driving from the audio at all. The visuals are riddled with artifacts, graphical glitches and horizontal stuttering. The one thing they did well was the actual feel of the car on the road (at least for road cars, iRacing still owns at the ovals). The menus and UI are mediocre at best.

Overall, I think of it like the first rFactor, it's a great platform to build on, just let someone else like Reiza Studios or Simbin do the building.  No disrespect to ISI, they created the framework for the multitude of games released on their original ISI engine that I love so I hate to see this game disappoint.

To be fair, I tried this game a few years ago and didn't care for it so I waited and tried it again today but with more testing and a TrackIR. Just doesn't do it for me.

If you are looking for the best graphics, pristine UI, quick loading times, an easy to understand button layout and a less dynamic physics model, you should look elsewhere.
When you drive in rFactor 2, you are given, in many ways, an unbeatable driving experience full of nuance and precision as well as a massive amount of content in terms of tracks and cars which, in my opinion, makes the simulation and its content worth every penny.
Despite this, it is a shame that so much of the focus of this sim's development is on physics because it would be nice to have better UI, nicer graphics and quicker loading times, but this sim's focus on physics is really what makes it as fantastic as it is despite its shortcomings.
Also, although the prior issues are clearly palpable; especially when you read the negative reviews, it is important to take into consideration Studio 397's attitude to progressing and developing the simulation in spite of their awkward situation.
Some clear points are that they are working (albeit slowly) to implement new UI, that they have been working on making the physics better and the loading times faster; the experience of using rFactor 2 a more streamlined experience.
When ISI ran the project of rFactor 2, something would go wrong or there would be an issue raised in forums or on twitter and silence was the general response; similarly, development was kept under tight wraps. The efforts being made by Studio 397, the current developers of the project, however, have been changed entirely.
There was recently a 24 hour race being hosted by Studio 397 and it went completely bottom up, with network issues kicking drivers out of the race, causing them to have to end it a few hours in. Whereas ISI would have ignored it and moved on, Studio 397 made an official statement and tried, while working with teams, to solve the issues that caused the race to end so prematurely. 
Similarly, Studio 397 keeps up to date with the wants of users of the simulation and informs them about the direction the simulation is going in with monthly roadmaps, updating users of the (albeit usually slow) progress being made on the features and toys users want.
Studio 397 is picking up a lot of flack for not doing things as quickly or as well as they could be doing, and to a degree, I feel unsatisfied with the amount of progress being made on this simulation and the amount of issues which seem to crop up so frequently, but it is important to remember the size of the development team of rFactor 2 and how it was acquired; that being by a team with little finance derivative of not being able to profit and thereon generate development funding from existing sales as the existing sales finance had gone to the previous owners, ISI.
Considering this circumstance, I think Studio 397 are doing a good job and that rFactor 2 could be on the up and up.
This, however, is what so many have been saying for so long and in many ways, rFactor 2 is just the same as it was when first released; clunky, temperamental and by modern standards, lacking in terms of features.
If you want a really advanced driving experience, get rFactor 2, it may annoy you getting used to it, but when you are on track, all qualms will melt away as it offers, what is in my opinion, the best physics model available on the current market. This is not to mention the phenomenal modding community with the content created for free by individuals and small groups frequently equalling the polish of Studio 397's offerings.
If you are looking for a more complete advanced driving experience in terms of the UI and non-physics related usability and polish, however, there are many other titles on the market which may sway you more.
If you want a modern physics model like the one shown in rFactor 2 with more polish, however, it may be worthwhile waiting for the release of Reiza Simulations' Automobilista 2 which may be out in December, but which also may lack the modding community which is in large part keeping rFactor 2 alive right now.

TL;DR, The physics engine and the experience of using it is a reward for the amount of effort you have to put in to overlook the clunkiness of this simulation. It is a worthwhile reward, but one which is likely to require the same amount of effort to access for a long while more. The simulation market is large and expanding, so it may be worthwhile waiting for something to fill the shoes of rFactor 2 if you do not feel as though the physics are a worthwhile reward during your 2 hour trial

Also, drive the McLaren formulas and the Taatus formulas, they are great as well as free. The DLC cars are also excellent, with everything in the Reiza pack being absolutely standout substantial. There are also some amazing free mods accessible via the workshop.",1568233456,1568233456,True,19,1,0.68982243537902832,0,True,False,False

However, as many others have opined, it's likely too little too late.

There are still unacceptable failures in the very core areas that make getting into a race even with friends far more difficult than any title should every be.
The UI is an unfriendly hodge-podge that relies on an atiquated system that makes you 'bundle' together tracks and cars to setup a session.
The thing is, there's so much user created content (some excellent stuff here), and so many different versions that more often than not you will find you can't join rooms and will b greeted by the error ""package unavailable"" which means you don't have some of the content, or your version is different.
So, rF2 knows what content is missing, yet doesn't tell you what is missing! So then you waste time trying to figure out what content your friend put in that you don't have.
And if you are trying to join a random room, you just move on.

There's a 'system' that a room creator can setup that is far more complex than 99% of players will want to be bothered with, and requires that you store all the content on your own dropbox or similar. The content is large, so not only will you need a paid dropbox, you will have to use various links to ensure that a random person wanting to join your room can have the content downloaded to be able to even join!

For leagues, there's limited content, so it's workable. 
But for the average player it's just a mess and they will find more often than not they play alone.

Like most SIMs there will be a number of people who will tell you that it's all very easy.
But the reality is, it's not. 
And besides, should you really have to do all this when pretty much every other SIM out there 'just works' if you want to race with other people?

Studio 397 continues to promise a fix/new UI but nothing changes and yet they continue to sell content with track prices reaching closer to iRacing prices. 
As an iRacing member, I can justify those prices when I simply choose what I want to race, when I want to race and click 'go' and I'm in a multiplayer race.
That's worth the price of subscription.

I hope rF2 fixes the glaring issues, or at the very least be putting all the money from the content they are selling into rF3.",1566589078,1566589078,True,4,0,0.538715481758117676,0,True,False,False

Studio 397's premier endurance event took place this past weekend on their newly released & laser-scanned version of Le Mans. Viewers could find the race on Motorsport.tv (a site dedicated to real life racing) & on Twitch.tv to watch some of the top sim racing teams compete--even the REAL Max Verstappen, someone that is asked about in chat every 3.2 seconds.

Whilst the competitive sim racing world mostly focuses on iRacing (evidenced by the amount of leagues, series, participants, streamers, and viewers), this was rFactor 2’s time to shine with a brand new track to show the world what it’s like today after being released to the public over six years ago. Unfortunately this event was marred by bugs, game crashes, and other technical difficulties that ultimately ended in the race being prematurely abandoned.

The 24 hour race suffered from multiple mass disconnects, client screen freezes, and accidents with invisible objects on a clearly untested circuit. The organizers red-flagged and then cancelled the race in the middle of the night, chalking it up to a ""few technical gremlins"" according to Studio 397's Twitter account. Negative replies from teams & drivers ensued, leaving the future of their product as a viable eSports racing platform in jeopardy.

I'd describe a ""technical gremlin"" as the unforeseen, unaccountable, unknown, and unfortunate kind of problem that can occur in a live event. It would be one thing if this were the first time we've seen it happen.

As a league admin for Virtual Online Racers (VOR), I first noticed these problems in December 2014 and proceeded to crow about it in every Studio 397 Facebook thread I could find. The response, often from apologists and those that hadn't experienced it yet, usually told me to upgrade my PC, the server, and fiddle with game settings. However the screen freezes were happening to all manner of machine components, at every kind of track & car combination  (official and otherwise), across multiple servers that we owned. Even those not experiencing the freezes were caught up in the bugs, because they would suddenly have a 1,150 kg car quantum leap INSIDE them--imagine the calamity & destruction of a server detecting two objects sharing the same location; Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"" often comes to mind during such incidents.

The official league for rFactor 2, run by Jimmi Allison (now a Studio 397 employee), has been running the Sim Racing Club to the best of his ability for several years; he successfully minimizes these ""technical gremlins"" in monthly events so that 40 teams per server can take part in 6 to 24 hour races. Members of the development staff are frequently in attendance to witness and even drive amidst these glaring problems (creating spectacularly unfair crashes on the race broadcasters as well) for several years now.

With the evidence mounting, it was only a matter of time before rFactor 2 would fail on a larger stage to unequivocally prove that their game is buggy beyond a simple server or client hardware issue. The only explanation for WHY it's so broken is: Incompetence. During that 2014-2015 period of VOR first observing the deep-rooted bugs, I would have also blamed ‘ignorance’ from preventing it from being fixed; now that it’s nearly five years on, they cannot claim that particular ‘I’ as an excuse.

Days before the July 2019 Le Mans race, teams wrote an open letter to the league admins & developers because their cars were fundamentally altered due to Balance of Performance (BoP) changes. Real life racing series, like the World Endurance Championship and Blancpain Series, frequently manipulate elements of a class to adjust the weight ballast, wing angles, boost, fuel flow, etc, to try to keep the field from getting too spread out. The sim racing teams addressed the pre-event tweaks, saying they were beyond mere minor changes in pace, but alarmingly perceptible differences in handling that nullified their preparation for their chosen machine (and it was too late to switch cars). It's a fair complaint if a team picks the Corvette C7R because of how it handled, who proceed to create a setup and practice for dozens (if not hundreds of hours), only to have an unreasonable degree of BoP turn their hard work upside down just  before a 24 hour race.

I am associated with a sim racing team that frequently attends endurance events, and the amount of work they put into the car is staggering and time consuming. The number of laps they must drive to become comfortable, the setup work involved, the pitstop strategies/contingencies discussed, fuel calculations, spreadsheet work, and figuring out the stint lengths (plus sacrificing sleep to fill in the gaps) is incredible.

To have all of that undone, not because of multi-class competitors causing an incident, a driver related mistake, or hazardous weather conditions, but the product itself having inherent “technical gremlins” to end a race? That’s a kick to the teeth.

In the spirit of the teams writing open letters to Studio 397 regarding the last minute BoP changes, I’m encouraging the rFactor 2 communities plagued by screen freezes and disconnects to boycott racing their product until the multiplayer breaking problems are entirely fixed.",1552098662,1562580644,False,38,5,0.688648223876953125,0,True,False,False

If you're a sim fan you won't be disappointed with rF2. I tried rF1 in the early days and didn't think too much of it then, but it has clearly improved and is now a damn fine racing sim.

If you've been into racing games and are looking for something more realistic, try this one. It may lack the story and drama of some racing games, but you'll find it far more enjoyable and rewarding to drive after you put in the practice time. The excellent AI makes for some challenging single player races, skill and aggressiveness are adjustable by % so they will always give you a hard time as your skill improves.

CrewChief is a very useful addon, spotter + other info is radio'd to you. If you like analysing telemetry or just want to check for FFB clipping, DAMplugin works well.

Some UI elements could be better. You lose the quick setup sliders from the previous game. Some of the setup options aren't labeled for example brake Bias doesn't tell you front or rear. you kinda guess based off of the numbers increasing or decreasing. same for setting the weight of the car.

There's quite a range of open wheel cars and historic versions. Before you buy, check the track and cars list so you know what you're getting.

Overall I didn't think the graphics were that bad, not as good as newer titles but decent with some jaggys on the track edges that maybe some settings might fix.

The strongest points of this game are the AI and force feedback. The FFB is very good with good feel for understeer and also how shifting the weight in corners is affecting the handling and grip. The AI is also a refreshing change from what you find in most other racing titles with frequent attempts to overtake on the inside and happy to stay door to door around corners.

Also it's promising to see continued development of this game although you'll have to fork out more money for official additional cars and tracks which I've yet to try.

Verdict: Buy on sale and be prepared to pay for additional content if you want to get the most of this game.
---

Spent 1.5 hours trying to get Fanatec Clubsport wheel to be recognised. Pedals work but steering wasn't very typical of how other sims recognise the hardware.  I found that you need to rotate steering fully in each direction for it to be recognised. If you move less than the full rotation it will not be mapped and look like it's not working.

Shouldn't have to spend hours just to get hardware setup and working. Every other racing sim has worked without issues using the same hardware.

Now hardware is mapped I will be able to review and hopefully give a thumbs up instead.",1561607608,1561645625,True,4,1,0.566115677356719971,0,True,False,False

It's safe to say that this game is a little rough around the edges.  Out of the box, at first glace, it doesn't appear to have that many tracks or cars to offer.  The graphics look a little strange and dated when comparing it to other sim racing titles.  The sound is lacking a little bit.  The UI the game uses is absolute garbage (hopefully not for long with an update in the works.)

With all that taken into consideration there are a couple really important things that rFactor 2 does tremendously well.  The FFB is top notch, easily the best out of all the other titles that are on the market.  The physics are fantastic as well.  The other aspect that the game does exceptionally well is with its AI.  The AI in this game is also hands down, better than every other title out there.  These two reasons alone are worth it's current price point.

Lastly, there are many things that can be done to improve the negatives I listed at the beginning of this review.  When it comes to tracks, the ones being offered in the rFactor 2 store are truely top notch.  They run, look and feel great (worth every penny.)  There are also hundreds of free custom tracks, of very high quality, in both the workshop and all over the internet.  If you have a favorite track that isn't included in the base game, there's a great chance you'll find a high quality version of it somewhere after a google search.  In terms of car selection, again the rFactor 2 stores selection of car packs to pay for are also extremely high quality in every way (worth the price point.)  Just like with the with the tracks, you can find hundreds of free high quality cars to download both on the workshop and online.  Graphically, at max settings with the right reshade preset applied, the game can look pretty good, borderline great under certain situations.

Basically, the things I mentioned that it does well, the game just does really really well.  I remember a reddit quote I read a while back, that I've had to dig to find again, that perfectly sums up the game (username BernieSander).  ""rFactor2 is the Linux of sim racing games. It will come ugly (default graphics are downright laughable) and bare boned, but the driving is fantastic and there are hundreds of fantastic mods you can find.""

so not really easy to use.. this is supposed to be a videogame not an ERP system..
other negatives notes are :
The multiplayer is dead
The graphics really dated 
the lack of laser-scanned track is huge compared to AC 
the UI in this game is the worst I have seen in all the videogames I have played in my life so far.
the sound engine is very bad

First of all be warned when buying this. After you launch the game, the launcher goes off to the workshop and downloads all the content which counts towards your playing time, so if you have a slow internet connection then it will take ages plus once it's finished downloading it then as to verify and install the content which again counts towards play time. 

Once everything was installed that is when the problems started. I could not get my wheel to work, Logitech G920, googled on how to fix this and managed to sort it. Then VR, the game will not run in VR without Steam VR running in the background. I don't like using it because it messes up a couple of other games when trying to run them. 

Finally managed to get everything running smoothly and tried a car and track. It was great and a real challenge, thought to myself I was going to enjoy this. Went off to try some other tracks and cars, Civic BTCC at Silverstone. I don't know what degree of turning they use in real life but in this game it was awful! Just going round a slight corner I had to turn the wheel a lot which made it undrivable. Thought I'll look into that later so tried another couple of cars which did not work at all with my wheel. Pulled out the pit garage and tried to turn towards the track but ended up driving straight and right into the wall opposite the garage.

Had to refund because by this time I was getting very close to the 2 hour mark for a refund.

I enjoyed GTR2 specifically for its graphic fidelity and its outstanding FFB detail.  Most recently, my primary racing titles have been Project cars2, Assetto Corsa, and of course iRacing.  I have been intentionally passing over rFactor, because of its poor graphics (In my opinion).  Over the holiday sale period, and friend informed me that rFactor 2 was selling for 1/2 off its regular price.  I hedged, remembering my experience with rFactor.  I watched some YouTube videos of RF2 and saw there had been some major improvements to the title.  

Visually, the RF2 has made noticeable upward strides.  The car models cover all the bases in terms of surface details, and interior fit and finish. Modding is still supported, very happy about that, as I have downloaded more than a few tracks and cars.  The quality of the add-ons are top really notch.  The game UI is much improved from the previous version.  With that, I want to give highest kudos to the car setup, chassis modification UI.  The layout of this section makes adjusting the various items a breeze. All you need for a specific section is all there in one panel. Very nice in deed.  The area I am most impressed with are the tire model.  

I've been an iRacing user for about three years, and I race a lot. Until now, I thought iRacing was the best there was in terms of tire modeling.  However, after spending some time with RF2, I must say there is a new top dog in terms of tire modeling.  RF2 has the best feel for what the tires are doing since GTR2 back in the day.  Tire and brake performance when you first pull onto the track has a noticeable and gradual change of texture from the initial rollout until they warm up.  When you make a chassis, aero, suspension, or alignment adjustment , you can feel the effect of the adjustment on the tires. If you make the right change, you know it, and if you make the wrong adjustment, the tires will let you know that you screwed up.  All in all, the accuracy is amazing.  

Even the AI is not seems much less prone to blowing into you. 

I will highly recommend rFactor 2 to any serious online racer and even for the casual online driver.  There is enough for any level of online sim racer.  That is to say, this is not an arcade racing. at least in my opinion.",1545725843,1545725843,True,24,0,0.701533615589141846,0,True,False,False

In-game it looks nothing like rF2 you might have gave upon some time ago:

Yes, these are in game shots. 

It's going to have laser scanned nords soon, so it's not just cars.

UI sucks atm but who effin cares.

I'm sure if I hit the forums I'll get it to work. But I shouldn't have to. This is sub standard for a modern racing sim.""

Well that was my first impression. And...I did hit the forums and I did get it to work. Over the last year I haven't clocked nearly the time with this game I would have liked to still I have  a decent impression of what it is, or can be. rFactor two is a dream sim for the DIY modders and people who like to customize their experience. If you want a ready to go racing game where you can just click and race without thinking to much this is not for you. This is a game for gearheads, who love car racing and who know or want to learn everything about it. Also almost every circuit is there to download for you. (Altough don't make the mistake to download and activate them all things get verry slow. Pick your 5 to ten favorites and cycle a couple to find the best.) 
The two tracks that really stand out to me and are enough  justification to buy this game are the sixties versions of SPA and Monaco. They take you back in time. I love it!

The develoipers have adopted a roling development scheme which means that the game is continually updated. Next to that they are releasing official high quality DLC that you can buy.
They have to make a living too so I buy some now and then, and I can't wait for their official version of the Norschleife that will probably be out next year.

It's probably up to your taste how it stacks up to other racing sim/games. As a racing simulator it's far more detailed than Forza Motorsport 7. Really Forza doesn't even come close. But if you want am easy game experience with a carreer mode and rewards Forza is for you.)
But when you compare it to Assetto Corsa and Project Cars two it's more about personal taste as they are all damn good. However they all have their pro's and cons and moments where they shine. None of them are really that expensive so why not have all three?",1498439448,1543319153,True,0,0,0.464393585920333862,0,True,False,False

There should be an option to instantly delete buggy WORKSHOP items but the game just makes you wait 30 mins to even start the game.. Of course the $ behind this game has no knowledge of who the game has been ruined by lax and lazy coders in control and do not care to fix the game instead go to Starbucks.

I get 4 constant RED bugs about cars in the purchase I did not purchase Endurance Pack with four cars.   Maybe some Skins I subcribed to in Workshop, but none found in list.

So here are some of the things you can expect to see in rFactor 2.

1. Some of the best driving physics found on any racing sim to date, especially the tyre model which is extremely realistic.
2. Based on realism the graphics in rFactor 2 are in my opinion outstanding , the draw distance, colour pallette and hdr textures, especially on the road surface are pretty much as good as it gets.
3 The UI is pretty basic at first glance but does offer indepth configuration for every aspect of the game.
4. Force Feedback , easily one of the best Force feedback systems you will find in any game, this is due to the fact that is directly linked to the tyre model, which means you can accurately detect loss of traction/grip at any speed,unlike many force feedback systems which feel predictable.
5.Dedicated server support and online multiplayer are available to those who subscribe. (optional)
6. Customisation and mod support has always been a big part of rFactor , rFactor 2 is no different , however being a newer game and the jump in technical ability requirments, this has led to less quantity and less quality mods being released. (give it some more time)
7. The AI in rFactor 2 are configurable which allows you to set skill/speed and aggression, definitely the least frustrating AI I have played against in all modern sims.
8. Superb performance , I run rFactor 2 in surround mode (triple screens 5760x1080) with everything maxed out , the game looks amazIng and framerates are consistantly 100+ depending on track, always above 75fps though.

What not to expect from rFactor 2

1. The main thing most newcomers will notice is the lack of branding or licensing. ( for me this is not a problem)
2. A mainstream game which has a limited life expectancy,
3. A game that holds your hand.
4..DLC

rFactor 2 accurately simulates a speeding race car (really well) , be it a formula or stock car, as well as any simulator I have ever used , there are many other well known great sims on the market, rFactor 2 deserves to sit at the top table of racing sims and imo is an absolute must buy sim for anyone who loves motorsport or racing sims.

I'm not a hardcore sim racer yet, but in my experiences with Assetto Corsa and Project Cars 1 & 2, along with many SimBin titles and finally a recent dive into iRacing...rFactor 2 is in its own league as a sim racing game. I liken the physics to be something like iRacing with more detailed FFB. 

To compare my experience:

Assetto Corsa - you feel like you're trail carving with the physics where if you step out of the driving line just a little bit, the game throws your car into a panic over/understeer almost instantaneously with very little opportunity to correct it. Also the AI still sucks compared to RF2 despite their significant improvements recently.

Project Cars 1 - uhh it's an arcade-sim...very VERY forgiving

Project Cars 2 - Still more arcade-sim, but while the phyics are decent in weight transfer, it doesn't translate well into the FFB to what the tires are doing which Assetto Corsa does better.

iRacing - Feels and drives a lot more like my experience in real cars, the oversteering and understeering require some real mistakes, but can be corrected with counter steering + good timing if you know what you're doing (unlike Assetto Corsa). Tires feel like they grip as much as they do IRL and also reach their limits closely to where they would IRL. Still easily #2 in sim racing physics and has the largest esports community.

EDIT i: Due to the number of hours I've enjoyed in this sim, the developer's feedback in the comments below, the increasing number of Brabham BT20 on open public servers, and the two different upcoming F1 1967 and F2 1967 mods, I've decided to give this the ""thumbs up"".  I do sincerly recommend this game, although I don't deny that there are oustanding issues and it may not be to everyone's liking.  I'll leave the original review below:

Firstly, this review is just for historic fans, since I haven't even downloaded any of the ""modern"" content, so fans of the modern, electric traction-controlled GT cars and F1 cars with their electronic gismos can disregard this review.

When I first drove out of the paddock (which is basically a car park) at Spa '66, I was quite literally blown away by the attention to detail.  A man stands there with his hand up hinting to you to wait, then he'll wave you on.  As soon as you get some speed in the historic Brabham BT20 you'll instantly appreciate the physics. Coming from GPL, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, I cannot emphasise enough just how ""right"" the car feels.  Much of this is through the force feedback (FFB), it's particulary noticable around Stavelot, two high speed right corners which pull the car in one direction then immediately into the other.  The FFB perfectly immitates this, and you almost feel that the car's left wheels are going to come off by the sheer pressure of the turns.  Surely no coincedence that the leading Ferrari's wheel breaks ending the lives of two children in the movie Grand Prix of 1966, the producers must have asked the actual drivers of the time ""Which part of the circut puts the most pressure on the wheel in order for it to break?"".  Stavelot, was the answer and hence is where the fatal accident occurs.  The FFB in rFactor 2 gives you exactly the same impression.  I could probably write several paragraphs on just how good the Spa '66 is in rFactor 2, but I'll leave it to your imagination.  But to put it briefly, everything you expect is there, from peaceful animated cows to the lethal barbed wire fencing that decapitated Chris Bristow in the 1960 Belgium GP.  It is, by far, the best circuit I've ever driven in a sim, and I've been driving sims  and ""simcades"" since Microprose Grand Prix.

Monaco ´66 is another highlight, I set the start time to about 4.30pm of a practice session, after a while I noticed the track become to lighten with beautfiul vintage street lights.  I hastly exited and changed the time to 9pm.  And then, what I delight I encountered; the whole track was lined with beautiful street lights hanging over the track, reminicent of an old town at Christmas.  If Spa '66 is the most thrilling track I've ever raced on, then Monaco '66 is surely the most beautiful.  However, this would mean little had the physics been sub-par; I echo many (if not all) of the other reviews here that the physics are beyond what you would expect from a consumer sim, so good in fact there's little point in even comparing rFactor 2 with iRacing and Assetto Corsa.  You can easily force a ""spin"", then you'll immediately feel ""micro-vibrations"" as I call them, which as the race progresses and the wheels degrade further, these mirco-vibrations felt via the FFB increase until the driving becomes progressively more and more difficult.  I haven't felt this on any other  sim to date.

So, you'll probably wondering why I don't recommend rFactor 2.  Well, had I written this review a few weeks ago I would have given it the ""thumbs up"", but as the more you play, the more speak to long-term members on the official forum via PM, the cracks begin to appear...

Driving against the AI, on a wet track at Spa '66 is extremely difficult; cars in front release a spray of rain that distract your vision and you can very easily lose control of the car just by being a touch more aggressive on the braking resulting in the car sliding into a house, and there's simply nothing you can do about it.  Hit a house hard enough and your car will burst into flames and your tyres and debris will fly about everywhere.  The crashes in rFactor are spectacular.  This of course, is realism, something which rFactor 2 excels in, but... there are bugs, so many bugs.  It's only to read the negative reviews to get some idea.  To go deeply into each and every one of them would most certainly exceed the maximum letter count for this review.  And it's not just bugs, there are other problems, here is quick run-down

- When raining, AI pits every other lap.  The ""moderator"" is aware of this, yet long-term users have stated this bug has existed from between six months to one and half years, depending on who you speak to.

- Several users complain that their wheel doesn't work, in particular the new Logitech wheels.  No official response, not even on the official forum.

- Absolutely no feedback from the developers.  Various threads have appeared on the forum, including such titled as ""How can we help?"", ""How can online be implemented?"".  Full of responses from enthusiaistic players, but not a single response from any of the developers.  I personally suggested, a full-distance time-trial with 100% damage where the drivers could be ranked in some kind of leaderboard.  Rather than hot-lapping as seen in other games, the driver who could maintain focus and concentration to complete a near two-hour time trial (I suggested 28 laps at Spa '´66 in the BT20 with variable weather conditions), but a version for modern ""90 degree chicances"" with electronic-assisted cars with a race distance that corresponds to modern GT and F1 races could also be done.  This would firstly act as a Leaderboard (as all racers like competition), but secondly as an alternative to iRacing's questionable safety racing license progression. But, despite much feedback from fellow racers, not a single word from any of the development team.

- Much of what has been done ""right"", like the historic cars, the dynamic ""real-road"", the changable weather, the physics and tyre model, the beauty that is Monaco '66 and the excitement that come from Spa '66 were done by the original developers, Image Space Incorporated.  Studio 357, the new owners, have shown absolutely no interest in historic content.  In fact, conversion of Spa ´66 to DX11 was abruptly stopped, which was, to quote the May 2017 roadmap, ""being finished as we speak"".  The same applied to the 1970's Brabham that looked great (although I personally prefer the wingless F1 cars of the sixties), which was again abrubtly stopped and is currently ""WIP"" despite being on the verge of completion.

- Studio 357 has promised more transparency, and they certainly succeeded.  Not a single roadmap since they took over has mentioned anything regarding the historic cars or tracks, and to add insult to injury, instead of licensing the Classic Lotus (which virtually ever sim and simcade has) or the historic McLarens which surely they could have licensed since they have been working closely with them, they licensed, wait for it..., the Tatuus!  Well that will surely boost sales, what a great investment that was.

Just to clarify, I don't claim to speak  for every one who owns rFactor 2.  There are those who are more than happy with the roadmap and progress towards generic modern electronic traction controlled, electronically-aided GT cars on modern circuits with 90 degree corners, followed by a 200m straight, then a chicane, and then repeat, and so forth.  My opinion is purely from an enthusiast of historic racing, where cars were purely mechanical and the only corners in tracks were taken at 180 mph.",1503720505,1533583864,False,1,0,0.508379876613616943,3,True,False,False

-amazing FFB
-cars feel very natural to drive. I can steer the car easily with just a throttle and a brake pedal. Powersliding is a breeze (not that you should, but it feels great if you want to). Catching slides is very easy. This is subjective, but imo no other sim (not even my beloved AMS) offers such a great steering feel.
-some people complain that there is not enough content. I don't agree. There is ton of FREE content available from workshop from ISI/Studio397 alone. There is even more stuff from modders. As always content from modders vary in quality. I don't subscribe to everything available on workshop. So far( apart from stock content) I've only tried Apex GT3 and it is amazing. I also got GT3 pack from Studio 397 and it is another must have, imo.  There are other gems out there, I'm sure you'll find something that interests you.
-lots has been said about rF2 tire model so I won't go into details, but indeed it is probably the most comprehensive and maybe the best out there
-dynamic weather, day/night cycles
-AI is one of the best, if you don't have time to race online this is important
-graphics is not as good as industry leaders such as pCars2, but has improved since dx11, and it will still get better in time (not all content has been yet updated to dx11)

ETA:
Studio397 just released Endurance Pack (Porsche 911 RSR, BMW M8 GTE, Chevy Corvette C7.R, Oreca 07 LMP2, and Norma M30 LMP3). This was an instant buy from me and I have to say it is another must have. Although I've briefly tested all the cars (they feel great) so far I've driven the Porsche the most. What an experience! Oh, and the sound! It is intoxicating. 
This is another must have. If you don't believe me check the forums. Endurance Pack has very positive reviews across the board.

Cons:
-not much going on if you want to pick up races going to online lobbies, but you can always join RaceDepartment, Simracing-GP or something else and there is plenty of races to pick from      
-devs still have a way to go to bring rF2 to its full potential, but I have to give them credit, as they've done a tremendous amount of work since taking over from ISI

It failed to do so. rFactor 2 launched in an incredibly broken state. Despite being a massive improvement over the first game, it failed to improve certain aspects and made others much worse. rFactor 2 made one thing clear though. It's physics engine was a force to be dealt with. The problem was that rFactor 2 relied on the rFactor 1 train of thought. ""We'll make very little content and let the community do the rest"". That worked in 2005 for one reason. ISI actually gave modders adequate tools to create new content. They failed to do that with rFactor 2. The new engine was way too advanced for most people and still to this day. That meant there was pretty much no content being created.

Fast forward a few years, things have improved quite a lot. People have a better understanding of the game. Still though, there is nowhere near the content of games like Assetto Corsa. The situation of rFactor 2 became so bad that an entirely new developer, Studio 397, had to come in and improve the game. For the past 2 years they've transformed rFactor 2 from a broken mess to a somewhat decent sim. They're creating new content for the game to compensate for the lack of a community of modders. The content has been well received as well. The game now runs on DX11 and it looks far better than when it first came out. It's almost an entirely new game.

Except there's still one problem. There's no consistently good content anywhere. Maybe this will change when there's more DLC released, but for the time being, it's pretty scarce. This isn't Assetto Corsa. There's still no dedicated community that's larger than 20 people. Even Automobilista, a game hardly anybody has heard of (but they should be playing), has more content creators, and there's hardly any there either.

With that out of the way, let's get to the actual game.

Physics: Industry-leading. There's no doubt about it. rFactor 2 is the official sim of MANY racing teams. The physics engine is incredibly advanced and able to do things like flat-spotting on tires, deformations, track rubbering, etc. Some of these are in modern sims, but ISI was the first to do it. While games like Assetto Corsa feel more balanced with their physics, in terms of pure advancement, rFactor 2 is practically the king.

Graphics: Decent. RF2 has come a long way from its launch. What once was a game with overexposure and graphics barely above rFactor 1 is now a game that competes with games like RaceRoom Racing Experience and others like it. It isn't winning any awards here and it's certainly still in need of more improvements, but it looks and feels fairly natural. It's still a little cartoony looking though.

Sound: Average. ISI games have never been the greatest here. It's highly dependent on the car. The new DLC packs are pretty good sounding. But older content is okay at best. This is no Automobilista or RaceRoom in sound.

Content: Severely lacking and very inconsistent. There's no denying it. Even the biggest rFactor 2 fanboys refuse to debate this. rFactor 2 has been lacking in content for over 7 years now. I struggle to ever find anything to want to race in. Granted, this is slowly changing with more mod support and new DLC content. But it's not there yet. Games with better content are out there and this is a major nail in the coffin here.

AI: The best in the business. AI was a major setback in rFactor 1. Not the case here. This is the other major improvement, along with physics, over the first game. The cars on track respect boundaries. They actually realize that you're on the track. They won't ram you for braking. They'll defend their position. They'll move out of the way if they're going to lose the position. They feel like real people. The only game to come close is Automobilista.

In conclusion, rFactor 2 is the underdog that deserves better. It's an incredibly capable sim held back by its small community and lack of content. It's had a rough lifespan. The game is in new hands now. Studio 397 isn't letting this horse die yet. They're just getting started. When the game has more content, I'd say pick it up.

I still recommend this game, but only when it's on sale. There's not much in the game for $32. You're better off with Assetto Corsa and Automobilista, both amazing games with tons of content and just as good racing for the same price.",1529544427,1529544427,True,52,1,0.816082179546356201,0,True,False,False

- Graphics are very solid (8/10)
- Both steam workshop and rFactor cars & tracks are extremely well done 
- Controls handle very well and are realistic
- Very diverse cars and tracks, from ice cream vans to NASCAR, and from the Top Gear Test Track to Daytona
- Online is very popular (when it comes to leagues)
- Weather & Time system is very well done
- Spotter is well done (despite the somehwat annoying voice)

Cons:

- Not all buttons on certain controllers are mappable
- You need high video memory for the complex AI
- Online Hosting is difficult to setup
- Certain Cars have issues with overiding others

PC2 is flashier and more presentable, but this is a much better simulation with more expandable content. iRacing would kick my ass completely, and Live for Speed is along those same lines. RaceRoom seems like a solid experience as well actually, it would've been that or RF2 but here we are. 

VR ran absolutely beautifully on the Odyssey, great turn around for this game. Good pickup for anyone that's looking for a sim that maybe isn't 100% focused on online racing. And if you actually want more realistic gearing than most games.",1524357795,1524357795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm happy, that's one.

So, I used (and I still do, when I can) to race in minor leagues, hillclimb and I even had a brief moment of street racing. I'm  your average 25 year old student from Italy who struggles to keep finances in check, so I'm used to (mostly) FWD vehicles, also because RWD are spectacular hard to find for a good price and because even if some team can rent them, they usually don't, as in Italy there are mostly very technical tracks.

I started playing this game what... 2 days ago? In 2 days I'm able to predict the car like my little old Corsa, which is sketchy af. But I could just change some settings, like ride height, damping, spring chambers... and it would float like any of those ""sparkly new"" Civic dominating the lower GT series. 
This. Is. Amazing.

Surely it could still improve a bit (I'm not sure if TCS is always OFF even if you set it off, it looks to me like a lot of times I lost speed drifting 'cause of TCS kicking in) and surely it's not your average-to-crash multiplayer game. Most lobbies I found were full of bots and occasional players, and those REALLY full were those behind a site where you need to register.

All in all, I feel this game is awesome, it's the first game I can FEEL the car even if the only thing I own is a G29 wheel with a shifter. 
What this game lacks mostly is those silly and pretty useless graphic addictions like a damage model for cars or eye-candies in the mid of the crowd (I'm not sure if you can turn the crowd into a 3D crowd, otherwise it's 2D) so this keeps most of the kids out of the way, meaning what? CLEANER RACING!

I experienced only a couple of races, but for what I've seen, contacts are only those which happen naturally between racers, not trolls or rammers or whatnot. Still, I won't take a sure stand on this, as it may be just a couple of lucky races.

This is awesome, the content is getting being locked behind DLCs, but Multiplayer and a LOT of base content is free, moreso that the workshop is HELLA ACTIVE and keeps pushing out awesome things. I even saw a multiplayer lobby about ""Pikes Peak Hillclimb"" and if I didn't own Dirt Rally I would jump into that straight away.

If you're looking for a sim, buy this. Love it. And please Studio 397, don't fuck it up and don't become iRacing. That shit is crazy nuts.

 Like all good things, if you persevere, you reap rewards. My old review below describes the gripes and frustration I had with not being able to use my T150 wheel. Out of frustration and disappointment I admit I gave up too soon.
Launching the 32-bit exe, the wheel comes to life. Everything works, all smooth and dandy, button assignment, ffb, correct rotation angles.
All settings done, just run the preferred 64-bit exe as normal and voila, you can now enjoy all the amazing things rF2 has too offer.
Granted, you [b]shouldn't[/b] have to have this kind of problems but give it a chance and you won't regret it.
____________________________________________________________________________
[i]I'm reviewing rFactor 2 out of frustration. After hearing so many good things about it I decided to take the plunge. Maybe this sim is great, alas, I wouldn't know because I can't even get the Thustmaster T150 configured.

1st time play: the profile for the T150 is there but the wheel is completely dead, no inputs are detected.

2nd restart: out of the blue the pedals come to life and button mapping is now working. The wheel however, is a different story.In the configuration screen it shows input when you turn it to the left but nothing else. Trying to drive, it doesn't register any rotation and gives random, scary 'kicks', as if you were driving that GT car down a mountain.

3rd restart: same thing. Anger and dissapointment abound.

Dirt Rally works perfectly with the T150, so what gives?
How can a SERIOUS DRIVING game have such a difficult time with a controller that it was, supposedly, designed to use, is beyond me. In 2017 this is simply unnacceptable!

The tyre model is on another level compared to other popular titles, the best i have ever experienced in any sim. The FFB is also top notch with an output based on the physics engine so you can really feel what is going on.
Day / night time racing and the dynamic track is just awesome. There is also rain which is not present in many other sim titles. A must buy for any racing fan who want to get to the real thing as close as you possibly can.

However rFactor 2 has plenty of problems that needs improvement.

The overall lack of content and the terrible user interface being my biggest concern. There is just not enought cars and tracks here.

Also the size of the modding community is not even close to the old rFactor or Assetto Corsa. There is only a very few high quality mods out there to choose from.

Multiplayer also needs work. It is really not that easy to get into, you really need to look for league racing to get that experience. I am not really interested in joining leagues so there is no option for people like me to race against real people. The amazing AI makes up for this a little but obviously it is not the same. There is not that much people playing this online other than leagure racing which is really a shame. I can only hope that the damage is not already done for the online play and Studio 397 is working on something to improve it. Going iRacing style whould be absolutely awesome for rFactor 2. Fingers crossed for something like that.

A lot of people bring up graphics as the biggest flaw in rFactor 2. I don't think that is the case as in this type of games graphics doesn't matter all that much. Sure it gives better immersion and all that but the main focus should be the driving and the physics and this sim really shines in those areas. Also the dx11 beta - which will soon take over as the main version of the sim - is a big improvement.

Plenty of more little errors and glitches here and there but for me the driving in this sim is so awesome it makes up for almost anything!

Don't get me wrong, Studio397 has been doing a great job giving this game new features such as  new cars and tracks, dx11, and a soon to come and much needed new ui, and I'm very thankful for them. However Rfactor2 is not a fully polished game yet. It's getting there though, Very good progress is being made. 

If you are considering buying this game, then PLEASE NOTE: 

In order to fully enjoy this you have to be concerned about physics and physics alone. You'll need to get a bunch of car and track mods in order to fully enjoy this game. Without them the car selection is a little strange, (no defualt GT3 cars, other than the random camaro, and only one BTCC car) and we're missing a lot of good tracks. (no Brans Hatch, Spa, modern Monza, COTA, or tons of other famous and fun tracks)
If you're concerned about career mode (there is no career mode), cars that are easy to drive, modern graphics, or a game to play with a controller(you have to have a wheel), this is NOT a good sim for you.

With that said: If you can look past that and are focused on the racing experience, the phyics and AI are amazing. They'll fight you for positions and if you mess up they'll be right there ready to pounce. They're fast and very enjoyable to race against. Physics are among the best, if not the best, and It's certainly a lot cheaper than Iracing. And the AI will punt you off the track less than if you were to start out in Iracing.

I personally will reccomend this to you if you match the listed above requirements. But if you don't, Assetto Corsa or Iracing is probably a better choice for you, or maybe wait and see if Project Cars 2 will be any good when it comes out.

If you want a racing game, it should be noted that this isn't a game. This is a simulator, on par with F1 simulations, and Rfactor's ability to set up game-like scenarios is limited.

However, if you're looking for the most realistic racing simulator on the market, this is by far the best choice.

What matters is how the car feels.  Can you connect with it via your steering wheel?  For me, that's a YES!  HELL YES!  I'm not fast, I'm no alien.  But within my skill level, I like to think I drive cars to or close to their limits (even if that ends up being slow).

This is a simulation that forces you to do some work.  Some that do not take this into consideration become frustrated.  I love it.  I've done a bit of real life racing and I've been involved as a helper on a few amateur teams.  It takes a lot of work by all involved.  So, I don't mind it.  I like it.  I like that car setup is greatly influenced by driving style.  If you run this sim like a sim you'll soon realize that, if you suck at driving like me, you'll need to fine tune the balance of the car to make up for it.  You have to warm up your tires.  You'll want to adjust your gearing.  The preload can be important.  On cars like the Celica GTO you'll have to adjust the front and rear downforce devices.  Brake bias is for real...

Force feedback, to me, is phenomenal.  The FF transmits enough information for you to know what the tires are doing front and rear.  It's weird... in a good way.  You can sense when a car's rearend is breaking loose and coming around.  The tire model is sick.  Seriously, deformation, damage, deflection, They are truly dynamic.  Temperature and pressure are a huge deal.  Nothing, NOTHING is better, to me, than the dynamic weather and track system.  The racing line gets stickier as cars deposit more and more rubber as the race progresses, the marbles gather off the line.  In the rain, the racing line becomes dryer and off line you're in standing water.  Track temperatures change similarly.  Weather changes dynamically and it affects everything.  Your perfect setup isn't so perfect when the temp drops/rises, when the rain drops and stops, etc.

There's so much to this game... if you're into simulation.  If not, there are other great titles out there.  Personally, I spend most of my time in RF2.  Assetto Corsa is another one of the titles I own and like.  It has its merits, for sure.  The eye candy is top notch.  The damage simulation, especially to mechanical systems is great.  But there's something canned (scripted) about the handling of the cars.  I can't put my finger on it.

Addendum: I race offline a lot because of time restrictions... the AI is pretty good on most tracks.  Compared to Project Cars it is great.  Second to RF2 is Assetto Corsa.  The AI is decent at overtaking, defending, etc.  I don't usually get crashed out by the AI.",1507897510,1508535364,True,40,1,0.763183712959289551,7,True,False,False

Only this time the name Rfactor is being handed over to another developer called studio 397 who are currently delivering alot of good updates for the game particulary the DX11 update which is currently in beta as well as the VR update.

So about Rfactor 2 it has massivly improved big time with better graphics, better pyhsics and its more friendlier to steering wheels where it would automatically set the degress of rotation for you. It also has steam workshop support which means its now more easier to get mods for the game. AI is another plus point. Last time in RF1 they would sit behind on long straights and wait till the corner to overtake, now there more bravier on diving down your inside as well as making passes on the straights. Its even more easier to customise the AI as well, Most of the editing is now in game in terms of limiting. In other words you won't have to edit PLR files to customise the AI as much now.

So if your looking for a racing sim in the modern era this is what you should go for!
To quote my words from the BVPCG episode on RF2: Forget about Project cars and forget about Asseto Corsa!! this is a racing sim you want!!

Here's a video of me covering Rf2 for my pc gaming series on youtube:

- Pros:
Good tyre model, run smoothly, the steam workshop integration makes it easy to install the mods, the GUI is austere but very functionnal, the AI does not seem too Artificial, the setup screen and the pit stop interfaces are very convenient, there are many nice little features that helps to ""feel there"" (the red lights of the pits, the manual pit speed limiter, the engine starter, etc....), you can try anything from a quad to a Formula One... But the true moment that amazed me so far was the rain that did come to surprise me while I was out on the track at Silverstone. At first, I noticed the sky getting darker on one side of the track, and later while back in the pits I could hear the first drops coming down. Going out again I found that while most of the track was dark and wet, a few feet around the racing line was visually AND physically much drier. After a while, the rain did stop, and after a while the track was fully usable again: that whole session made me understood that the goal of rFactor is not just about driving well-simulated cars, it is about driving well-simulated cars in a well-simulated environment, and make you believe you are on a real track day. +1 for the immersion factor.
- Cons:
I could not find any proper documentation for the beginner (I had to scratch my head to find out how to add different types of AI cars to a single player race- hint: click the ""session"" title in the main screen). The content quality depends quite a lot on the quality of the team that made it - but there is already substantial amount of official content made by ISI and Studio397, as you can judge from the workshop. To be honest, it definitely does not look as polished and finished as Asseto Corsa at the moment. I feel sometimes that like this program was written by engineers, for engineers ! Graphics are unconsistent, with appropriate cars but somewhat disappointing tracks and lighting (apart from the realRoad feature). Definitely do not expect lens flares or advanced haze effects - but also remember only cameras or glasses create lens flares, not the human eye. Do not expect an RPG-like career or anything like this, the GUI is just there to launch the simulator and watch replays a bit like in, say, Grand Prix Legends.

Conclusions:
I feel rFactor 2 is going through an exiting time at the moment. In case you did not know, the sim was 80$ (to get lifetime multiplayer) until a few months ago. The core simulator was developped by ISI (maker of professional simulators for car manufacturers and race teams) but has been handed over to Studio397 last year. I believe the strategy of Studio397 is a good one: they claim to refocus the sim around a few popular series to give it a solid basis and get it going from there. They also seem to be well aware of the drawbacks of the sim - and are apparently on their way to correct them to make the most out of the strong core ISI provided (like SIMBIM and Reiza did based on rFactor1 maybe ?)

The helpful-to-unhelpful ratio for any negative review for this game should be seen as a warning as to the nature of the community, something which is even better illustrated in places like RaceDepartment.

The force feedback with a wheel is dull, dead, constant and bland, giving almost no valuable information whatsoever. The car feeling is largely nonexistent, with the FFB seemingly mostly emulating only the track itself. In fact, the handling itself appears to be broken - even after looking up information on ""good"" FFB settings in multiple places, none of them made any of the car I tried handle like they are supposed to - when losing traction, for instance, the steering barely reacts at all, making death slides (already a common theme in games powered by ISI's engines, but taken to the extreme here) frustrating beyond belief.

Frankly, when even F1 2016 (hell, even F1 2013, and that's saying something) has better force feedback, I have no reason to consider this game, hence why I refunded. It goes without saying that the graphics, particularly the UI, are mediocre as well, and the heavy reliance on mods does the game no good either as it almost completely nullifies any of the few good elements of the feedback through the general low quality of most community-made works.

Get AMS instead. I don't like that one much either due to its questionable feeling, but it still completely trounces rFactor 2 in every regard. Even the graphics are barely any worse.

Also, keep in mind that the demo does not actually give an accurate representation of what the game feels like. The demo 100% uses an older build, with multiple cars feeling completely different from the way they feel in the full-priced title while still being unrealistic and offering terrible feedback.

And just in case you're doubting the realism factor, you need only check the lap times in the World's Fastest Gamer event: they're seconds faster than real life. And that's with an actual serious car and not a modded one.",1500538313,1501829053,False,3,2,0.412516623735427856,5,True,False,False

Like others, I could describe the great feeling of driving any car in the sim or the plethora of options that set it apart from the competition.  Or the idea that it is lacking in graphics somewhat to prettier counterparts like Project Cars or Forza.  Or that the menus fall a little flat.

But despite the technical wrongs and rights, it just feels spectacular to drive - the most important aspect of all.  And more than that, there is a competent studio behind it, Studio 397, who is continuing to not just invest in the title with major overhauls in all areas but with constant communication with its user base as well.  And that communication goes both ways which is a huge win in this industry and for this genre.

There is some paid content being developed alongside free content but it is well worth it and helps them to continue improving the sim.  If they have the approach like Assetto Corsa (I wish I could merge the best aspects of both sims) which allows you to race against purchased content online without paying for it, I'm all for it.  Sometimes the groups I run with don't want to/can't afford to throw down for a new car mod.  And that's fine.  I hope it proves to be a profit center without upsetting the balance of the game (which it shouldn't based on their approach so far).  I know I plan on buying some cars here and there.  They do fantastic work.

And they are making the ability to mod the platform easier and ever better which means more quality, free content from community developers.  Should all their plans and intents come to fruition as far as improving graphics, UIs, plugins, online experience and content, I see rFactor 2 gaining as much success as its predecessor, if not more so as THE racing sim of choice.",1501095107,1501095107,True,15,1,0.610821962356567383,0,True,False,False

The main draw for me is the AI, tyre wear and pit stops, as well as Oval racing.

It has a phenomenal and top of the line physics better than any track based racing game I've ever tried before. The driving physics beats out anything out of the market as the driving is overall satisfying and enjoyable.

While rFactor 2 may be lacking in graphics and official licensing, this game's physics and overall immersion beats it compared to anything in the market. rFactor 2 has everything you can dream of in track based racing from Formula 1 cars and grand tourers to regular street cars. All of this is backed by the thriving modding community behind the game that provide exciting and suprising content to the table. However, rFactor 2's reliance in mods isn't always good as some tracks or cars are proven to be somewhat clunky compared to the official tracks and cars made by the Studio397. But rFactor 2 still remains to have fantastic modding support.

rFactor 2 is seen as a left for dead sim racing games, overshadowed for Assetto Corsa and iRacing. however, one thing rFactor 2 has what these other popular racing sims has that rFactor 2's overall cost and efficient simulation remains one of the best bang for buck racing sims out there, even having superior physics than AC alongside with its physics able to compete with iRacing, a subscription based racing sim.

Ever since rFactor 2 was given development to Studio397, the game has a bright future ahead of itself. DX11 and VR support is coming, giving the game to address its previous criticisms and attain attention from the media and the public to show how rFactor 2 is a different racer compared to Assetto Corsa and iRacing. To show how underrated and overshadowed it has been, and how it has the guts to compete with these sim racers.

Overall this game is a sim racing masterpiece, despite its weaknesses and clunkiness.


(Now if you want to try out rFactor 2, I would suggest buying it instead of trying the demo. The demo is known to be an old previous build that is shown to be unfunctional on people's setups including mine when booting up the game. Give rFactor 2 a try for under 2 hours and if you're unsatisfied, go refund it if you want to.)

I run:
Fanatec 911 GT2 (900 degrees)
Fanatec CSR Elite Pedals
Works with the game well.

Force Feeback: Similar to Assetto Corsa, but not better.
Graphics: I tried the DX11 and aslo DX9. Although rF2 now features DX11 the game looks like a game before the year 2000. It is not a graphic you can expect from a racing sim in the year 2017! 
Furthermore driver arms collide with the monococ of the Renault Formula 3.5 for example , and also by the Formula 2012. 
I was also wondering why the rain comes inside the car. This is a joke, but not serious a simracing game?! For example when you enable rain, and you will choose the normal cockpit view for the Renault Megane you will always see rain drops INSIDE the car. 
The Head Up Display make you feel playing a racing game back in the 90s. The HUDs are very big, occluding very much of the screen, and anyway they are not good readable! 
Disgusting also that the game starts in a window (at windows desktop), where you have to decide if you start Single Player Mode OR Multi Player Mode. Depending on what you choose the game starts, this means if you select SP you only can drive offline. If you want to go online you have to close the game and restart the game in Multiplayer- Mode again. Very circumstantial.
Variety of Multiplayer Sessions are rare and and clearly less than available Multiplayer Races in Assetto Corsa for example.
Last, the standard content of rFactor is limited. (About 15 cars) , not considering mods. Other sims offer 100 cars and more...
Finally I can say, due to the summer sale discount (14,99 €), I gave rF2 a chance, but it is completely not my game, and it is not what I can expect from a racing simulation. I can clearly recommend to prefer Assetto Corsa. This game is by far the best sim racing game at the moment. Forget RF2, forget Project Cars and forget RaceRoom Racing Experience. I compared all games and Assetto is still the best game. Regarding physics, graphics, car range and multiplayer. 
I returned rF2 within the first 2 hours because, independend of 14,99 € is no money for me, I will not play rF2 , because I won't have fun with this game. I will play Assetto Corsa, and will have a look at PC2 (maybe) and looking forward to GTR3 in 2018.

I've owned rFactor 2 for quite some time but only put a short time into it. Immersion is built on visual appeal too. It's 'just' functional stuck in the past visuals and unfriendly clunky interface had me abandoning rFactor 2 as soon as I first tried it.

But now I'm back and it's starting to transform into a solid title. We're still not on the same page as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars graphics here, or indeed the UI which still remains a mess in parts. But it's no longer the distaster it once was.

Now then should you buy it, well probably not yet. rFactor 2 is incomplete and has been for years. Work is progressing at a fair pace in 2017 since a new studio took up the mantle. I'm certainly confident of it's future, but rFactor 2 isn't the only racing game with realistic physics. Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom are fully fleshed out (and complete) making the half-done rFactor 2 look less appealing.

One more thing. For me in-car view was stuck at an awkward angle looking up. There's no in-game tilt seat option so after some online research I discovered the player.JSON file and manually set the Seat Pitch. A good example of it's incomplete status.

If you're looking for your first realistic racing sim, seriously stay away from rFactor 2 you'll be very disapointed. Go with Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom. If you own all the other racing sims then this is another to add to your collection as you simply won't be able to help yourself and you'll enjoy it for all the simmyness goodness it has.",1498057928,1498123559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are definitely on the right way now. The recent updates improved Rfactor 2 a lot.
A few things can still be improved, though.
1. There should be an option to use different rules than the new F1 rules so you can choose if you want to refuel or not and work out a strategy at which lap(s) you want to make a pit stop.
2. You should rework the graining textures on the road surface. It looks a lot more realistic in F1 2016 for example.

The physics model, tyre & weather simulation and top notch FFB are what differentiates rF2 and makes it ""just about"" worth its current price-tag (p2p online).

On the other hand the dated graphics, interiors/cockpits, lacklustre tracks (laser scanned anyone?), no official licenses, minimalist steam workshop implementation and non-existent multiplayer lobby beg the question of choosing rF2 (pay to play online) over racing titles like iRacing (sub and fees) or Assetto Corsa (perhaps Project Cars too), which are seemingly more accomplished in much less development time. To put it in perspective, in a mere couple of years, Assetto Corsa has improved by leaps and bounds and currently established as the preferred choice of the modding community and online league racing sim enthusiasts.

In spite of the stiff competition, I would recommend rF2 to dedicated and serious racing enthusiasts for the sim experience. In addition, now that Studio 397 have taken over, the development road-map looks very promising (monthly updates, DX11 at long long last, UI revamp, VR, spotting, mp lobby etc) which at long last will bring rF2 a much wider recognition (not just for purists) and instead of a maybe vote it would be a definitely yes to buy vote.

The move to a free online model was also a big plus in my book. I wanted to experience some of the best physics that sim-racing has to offer so took the plunge!

After a few weeks with the sim I can honestly say that I consider it my go-to racing title. The physics and force feedback truly are top notch. The tire model is phenomenal. The damage model is robust. The ""live"" track rubbering and racing lines are great. The day/night cycle and dynamic weather patterns are awesome, especially in how the tracks respond to rain and drying. The pitstops are convincing and well implemented (minus the lack of visible crew). And the AI, wow! It can drive and definitely give you a run for your money! It's very convincing and responds well to the player and to each other, makes little ""mistakes"" here and there, feels very alive and intuitive. The official content engine sounds, tire squeals, wind noises, etc etc all are very well done overall! I also really appreciate the attention given to the player's head movement in how it responds both to the aerodynamics of the car and the forces of the engine. The movements even blend nicely with headtracking, very cool!. Being able to race online with AI populating the track is also a welcome feature.

(I could go on, but you get the idea... Big thumbs up in my book in almost every category. Almost...)

The only knock I have against the title, and how I would summarize it in its current state is that it's kind of an Arma 2/3 (military simulation) equivalent of racing sims. When it comes together with high quality cars and tracks, the experience is sublime and I consider the experience second to none! But when a car or track is lacking, it's quite noticeable. The community made content can feel hit and miss at times and some of the content seems to be carry-overs from rF1. Given that much of it is free to download, I can't really complain and I applaud everyone's efforts and contributions. From what I gather it's a tall order indeed to mod a car properly for this game. Much more nuance and detail involved to properly implement all the things it has cracking under its hood. 

While part of me wishes laser-scanned tracks were officially implemented (AC has me spoiled!) I can honestly say that while I notice the added fidelity of a lasered track, a well modeled and detailed non-scanned road mesh can be nearly as enjoyable, especially when paired with vehicle physics simulation of rF2's calibre. And yeah, while I wish the car roster was larger and the devs collaborated with the manufacturer's directly (again, AC has me spoiled!) I can't say that I miss it much. I'd take rF2 over AC pretty much any day of the week unless I have a hankering to shred the LaFerrari, FXX K, or Aventador. Or P1. Or Mercedes 190E EVO II, the Alfa 155 TI, the BMW DTM... Or the Zonda R, Porsche 911, 918, 919, Scuderia...  Dang, that's *such* a nice roster, way to go Kunos! haha  

But who am I kidding!? At the end of the day, while I do consider rF2 the gold-standard and in a class of its own, it's a great time to drive sims and rather than nitpick the finer points of each title, it may be best to just settle in for a ride and enjoy yourself, eh?

I'm excited for what Studio-397, the new owner and content creator, has in store for rF2.

At first impression, rFactor 2 could feel underwhelming. The graphics look outdated, the car selection might not feel very exciting, and the tracks not that many either.

However, the game is true to its sim racing theme. It's the only racing game that I own that actually teaches me the importance of paying attention to weight shifting during cornering. If you don't pay attention to your car's weight distribution during cornering you're going to lose traction (skidding, eventually losing control of the car in cornering), oversteer, or spin out due to both longitudinal and lateral forces that are acting on your car that affect your car's grip. You can minimize these forces by actually respecting the racing line. The racing line is the line on which you can maximize pushing each car to the edge of its performance envelope and this is done through applying gentle weight transfer on your car by following the racing line. Now, don't misunderstand me that I was saying that the game taught me to follow the race line. Other racing sims do that too but rFactor 2 is unique that it teaches me WHY I should follow the racing line other than to be fast. The racing line enables you to get the maximum out of your car by not pushing the car beyond the car's performance envelope, mainly by minimizing weight transfer so that your car is driven on the edge of its optimum performance. Each car has a different performance envelope but each nevertheless needs to follow the racing line to be driven optimally. Some cars have smaller performance envelopes and others bigger enabling you to make more mistakes and mostly get away with them although it will hurt your lap time. To put it short, it's a racing sim that actually teaches you how to be a proper race driver. Its excellent physics simulation teaches you the why that you don't get in ANY OTHER RACING TITLES (I own Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, and Dirt Rally). 

If you have a passion on driving fast, this is the game for you. Now, this is not quite the game for people who just simply love cars. This is THE game for people who love TO DRIVE on a permanent roadcourse (track). It's LESS OF A CAR GAME and MORE OF A DRIVER'S GAME.

So, if you're not a 'driver' or lack the passion to be a technical race driver this may not be the game for you. But if you're interested in the intricacies of being a race driver, then this is THE game for you (load 'Skip Barber' car and 'Lime Rock Full Chicanes' track with at least stability control assist OFF).

Definitely not the best for graphics, multiplayer or usability. Hopefully the online component will improve when the U.I gets updated and is a bit more user friendly. The driving model has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you put in the hours you'll discover the depth of the physics engine comapred to other titles. 

I've read the usual 'not enough grip' comments, and they are based on ignorance. It's been said before but I'll say it again - you REALLY need to wait for the tires to warm up, and then for the track surface to become 'rubbered in'. Once you do that there's plenty of grip, provided you don't just mindlessly crank the steering into the corner carrying way too much speed. You must be smooth with the steering and have the front tires pointed in the right direction (sounds obvious but takes practice), and be very gentle on the throttle mid corner. Look at the speedo and realize how fast you are traveling before you conclude that there isn't enough grip. 

The ffb is the benchmark in the genre, though it takes quite a while to tweak it to your liking. I've read comments such as 'too much vibration' or 'too much rattling'. This is caused by two things, firstly a flat spotted tire from a lock up, secondly, rF2's ffb is extremely detailed and some consumer wheels (such as the G27) can't handle it - this isn't a problem, simply turn up the 'smoothing' and it's fine. 

A.I is fantastic to race against, provided you know racing etiquette and are respectful of the A.I's track position. They will race you hard, overtake, and defend thier position. Not perfect by any stretch, but agian, the best in the business. 

Leans heavily toward racing cars as far as content goes, though the road cars included are great.

Objectively the most advanced physics and tire model.

Ultimately it comes down to this - if you have time, patience, the ability to focus, and enough intelligence to understand the dynamics of car handling, this is the most harcore racing experience and is the sim for you. It will feel totally different from what you are used to, but give it time and you'll see why this is the sim of choice for the most serious racers.

I have already improved my braking technique by using this sim (2 seconds gained!), the physics simulation and FF is the best in the market and even if the number of good mods is quite small now, after integration with steam workshop it can only grow.

Pros:
- The physics are (probably) the best among all the simulators.
- Online subscription permanently removed.
- The hardware requirements are not extreme, I can run the software with good frame rates in a machine that's 5 years old.
- Driving the cars in this simulator is a delightful and rewarding experience.
- Mods can be managed with Steam Workshop, I like to manage everything with Steam. New mods will be added here, and it supports paid content (good bye rfactorcentral).

Cons:
- VR is still not supported (December 2016).
- The online servers are either empty or private. iRacing is still the best for competitive multiplayer.
- The AI drivers are not good. (The other simulator I drive has no AI drivers, which is the logical option.)
- The amount of good mods is small compared to the first rFactor.
- The graphics are not as good as the graphics in non-simulator driving games. This is not important for me, but may be it is for the person reading this review.

Therefore this simulator can be recommended to anyone wanting to practice their driving, to improve their technique, to shorten their lap times and to master the nuances of the difficult cars like the Brabham, in practice mode or racing against the AI. Disable all driving aids for a good wheel experience.

I can only recommend this simulator for multiplayer if you already are member of a league and they want to use rFactor2. Otherwise stick with iRacing.",1482863965,1482864042,True,1,0,0,3,True,False,False

Let's start with the realism: Cars handle very nicely and realisticly. The handling kinda reminds me off iRacing, which in my mind is a good thing as iRacing's physics is 10/10. I would actually say that rFactor 2 has slightly better physics, no doubt. They pushed it to 11/10, and how? Well one example that blew my mind happened in a 3 hour race I did in a GT2 Corvette. I was battling with the AI (we will look at the AI later) and in the exciting battle I got a small hit, went sideways and stood on the brakes while the cars was going sideways on asphalt or concrete. When I continued everything was fine until I reached higher speed or high speed corners and experienced lots of vibrations in my FFB wheel. Why? Because the game simulates flat spots really well. You might say that Assetto Corsa also simulates this, but not as well as rFactor 2.

Then we have the AI. Let me first talk quickly about Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa is, at least for me, a game where you do hotlapping, often around the Nurburgring. It is a very fun game, but the level of simulation, the way the cars feel, its not really a racing game, more like a hotlapping game where you drive different cars around different tracks either online of offline for fun. The AI isn't that enjoyable to race with in Assetto Corsa, but when it comes to rFactor 2 they AI is just amazing! If you are close to them they will, not always but often, move to the inside line and give up the ideal racing line to defend their position. They will also dive bomb you if you are going slow into a corner. The AI can also do things wrong, just like a normal person, like get one wheel on the grass and spinout. The AI is also extremely fun to battle with in rFactor 2. I did a 3 hour race in GT2 Corvettes mixed with LMP2 cars. I was in a Corvette. The faster LMP2 AI cars would respect you and find a safe way past you, but they could also cut somewhat close in front of you once they pass you, it just feels so realistic.

There are lots of leagues for this game and race series for the fast and good sim racers out there. Like VEC, Virtual Endurance Championship. It really is a game for racing unlike Assetto Corsa, and obviously you have day night cycles, rain, etc. Not that many cars or tracks included, some cars and tracks are also fictional, but as this is a game for league racing you will find LOTS of HIGH QUALITY cars and tracks. I downloaded a Sebring 12hour track with a league configuration. It is just so good, with the bumps, etc. This is a MUST have game if you're into sim racing. It is kinda like iRacing but with singleplayer and extremely good AI. Obviously you have online racing as there is league racing, but this costs money. You can buy lifetime online service or a subscription.

3rd party content is scattered across a dozen fan sites.  Fan-made tracks are decent to good quality.  Some are rough around the edges.  All are harder to find than they should be.  I've managed to download all of the real world circuits found in Forza 6.  I have several friends who run a weekly Forza racing league.  We'll see if practicing in Rfactor 2 translates to better skill in Forza, or Gran Turismo for that matter.  I picked Rfactor 2 because it's cheaper than buying an Xbox One, game and compatible wheel.  $650 total, minimum.

In terms of fun factor, Gran Turismo/Forza wins.  In terms of feelings of accomplishment, Rfactor 2 is better.  I think it's easier for me to learn tracks in Gran Turismo; however, learning racing lines is easier to do in Rfactor 2...because it's a requirement to avoid spinning.

as i have said in other reviews this is by far the best game in terms of the physics, proven by the F1, indy car and nascar teams who use rFactor pro for their simulators and CAD models. I as a guy who has driven a formula renault car can say that every feedback i got from the car was the same in the game but good physics do not make a good game. The tracks are the closest to real life they can be without laserscan. Furthermore i think this game has alongside f1 2015 the best AI in terms of pace and racecraft. Some people critize the graphics of the game but i think that this game has the best physics so i do not mind about the graphics too much at least they have unlike iRacing real road transmission, a day-night cyclus and rain.Of course the online part is almost non excistent but i can have alot of fun in singleplayer aswell although it took me some 40h to get up to some decent speed, the longest it ever took me at a rscing game P2 in that terms is iRacing where it took me just 15h. Now to the comparision between the two most advanced sims out there:
iRacing:
pros: 
-good graphics
-great community ( the karting/ racing school of the next generation)
-a lot real race drivers drive it
cons:
-bad price model
-no singleplayer+ AI
-no day-night transmission, rain, dynamic road

rFactor2:
pros:
-realistic physics  prooven by F1 teams ( for all of you who say:"" But that is the pro version, not the customer version"". I have driven a simulator using Rfactor pro i can tell you the vehicle dynamics are the same in Rfactor2 just the mechanics and aerodynamics are way more complicated/ complex e.g. the overheating issues or the set up)
- still decent graphics
- singleplayer+ AI
-day-night transmission, rain , dynamic road
-good price modell
cons:
- almost no excistent multiplayer league

My winner, favourite and trainig tool is rFactor 2 but it needs to get some big updates such as an actual F1 car, maybe a few lasescanned tracks and at least one professional league with real prices because iRacing has done/ improved the right things recently and is very close to Rfactor2, if they get the rain and day-night transmission they will overtake Rfactor 2 inn my opinion",1467810465,1467811192,True,7,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

The first rfactor was (and still is) awesome, but rfactor 2 introduced an even more realistic approach, with its RealRoad system.

The graphics are obviously not as good as the ones from its competitors, but if you are a hardcore simracer, this shouldn't bother you, as they are still decent. Besides, this game was made for hardcore simracers anyway, so casual racers may have a hard time enjoying this. If you want to be really competitive, it's imperative to invest a lot of time to practice setups, etc.
In my opinion to fully enjoy rfactor 2 one should join one of the many online simracing leagues that use this simulation and race online. Because the online mode is what this game is really made for (as was its predecessor). It might take a little time to get into it, as especially for rookies or people coming from more arcade-like games as Forza the start may be difficult, but with enough practice, this really is the most realistic simulation when it comes to driving physics right now on the market.",1461840839,1461840839,True,5,1,0.56081080436706543,3,True,False,False

The things that rfactor 2 does, it does best. It has fantastic FFB & driving dynamics. Ever changing track conditions, tires, temps, to my eyes one of the most natural & realistic visuals, great A.I, and on and on. But it somehow feels unfinished. It is a little short on content, but does have a decent modding community which is now a part of Steam's workshop. 

rFactor 2 is an ever evolving title, and if you can stick with it, it will reward you from time to time. It is beautifully immersive with great sounds, 24hr day cycles (hello night racing!) full weather cycles, full car systems such as tire temps, brake temps, water, and oil, etc. 

I recommend this game for driving purists. It is a demanding title, and will require you to work on your driving technique & style, car set up, constantly aware of track conditions, line racing, and fighting for position.  If this sounds overwhelming to you, perhaps check out other titles such as Assetto Corsa. If not, you cannot go wrong with rFactor 2, and similarly Automobilista.

The default FFB settings and default car mechanics are definitely not made by mechanics that is for shore because default setting is close to a joke it is so bad I aint good any words to describe it.

That said I will state later here some cars is realy good.

But do I recommend this sim? Yes definitely it got some nice things to offer, is it in the top of sim list.. naaa.. not realy! You may want to spend alot of time tweek some vehicles and FFB but the later i've yet to find a setting that resembles some IRL like behavior. Compared to my 30+ years behind the wheel and that is on alot of tracks with real race cars to not just regular honda civic and some street racing wannabe cars. The physics and FFB on some cars is so terrible but set to very, very low setting it is fair or turn it off and there disappear all the fun. But that is about it and some cars it is realy good in physics and with the FFB set higher, not realistic but it's geting close on some cars and tracks. So gues if guys working on mods do some realy serious investegating and updating frequently it could turn out ok. 

Am I disepointed? No there is a lot of good tracks and enogh good cars to have fun with it and it's fairly cheep, do I think the online mode is worth it? Not in this lifetime... if so they realy need to step up their game a 1000% I don't see that happen any centuary soon.. ;) 

But in short, not to expencive for a lot of nice tracks, enough good vehechle to have a fun hour of flooring the throtle, slip and sliding and drifting.. or just learn a track you haven't driven on before..  :D

I have several other racing sim games that all are good, but when I heard that car's screaming V12 I just had to drive it.

So, how does it stand against the other sims?

First thing, it's DX9 only. For better or for worse. Now, I don't really care that much about graphics in these kind of games since it's way more about the physics that is important. With that said, yes, it does look like it's older cousins (GTR2, Race07 e t c) so it's definitely not ugly but don't expect all that fancy stuff that PCars, Assetto and the others bring to the table. In all honesty, with DX9 being the base, I would actually expect a bit higher FPS. 

Graphics: 6/10 (maybe a 7/10 if you consider it's DX9)

Now to the important stuff, the physics.

It's well on par with all the rest of them. I had 0 issues getting the FF and everything else to work with my G27.
It delivers what you expect a sim racer to deliver and it feels very dynamic. You will have to spend time tinkering with your car to get it to suit your driving style but that's why we play these kind of games. Like I said, if you have another sim game you will get what you expect. I have one critisism though and that is that track edges and curbs are a bit exaggerated in the handling. I don't know if it's the cars or if it's the engine itself, but YES, you can drive the curbs without losing traction completely in real life. 

Physics 9/10. (That's actually what I would give all the sim racers I have including the new ones).

Connecting back to the reason for why I bought the game, content. It's actually kind of slim out of the box both with cars and tracks. I myself am in no way whatsoever interested in 10 different oval tracks. But.. here is where modding comes in. The game supports Steam Workshop and I don't think I've ever had a racing game where it's easier to add more stuff. Browse the Steam WS, click subscribe and the next time you fire up the launcher the stuff is there. It will, of course, also keep track of any updates to what you have subscribed to. But wait, it doesn't end there (I know, that sounds like TV shopping). There are tons of tracks, cars and entire leagues you can download and it's almost as easy as Steam WS. 
Download and extract if necessary to a folder somewhere, point the launcher to include that folder, refresh and it shows up and you can install. Brilliant. I simply love racing from the 80's (F1 or Group C or 5 doesn't matter). I love the pureness and raw feeling without ESC, ABS and TC. The downside is that from what I've seen, rFactor had more enthusiasts that made stuff than to rFactor 2. But, with one install I got all the teams from F1 1992. You can't go wrong with that.

Content and modding support: 10/10

Last but not least, Online racing (yes ladies and germs, that is what you eventually have to do if you want to prove that you can handle 800bhp on a track). Of course racing against your brothers and sisters is way more fun than the AI. And here is where I think they messed up. They chose a subscription model similar to iRacing and even if I can see that it keeps the riff-raff out of the lobbies, it also limits the population. Remember, PCars and the others have no extra fees for online racing. They even support dedicated servers that you can rent. So, yes, this is a mistake since I think that the user base is the most important thing for keeping it alive and, in this case, the mods to keep coming. And with this subscription model you simply will only get the die hard fans (likely the same guys that race rFactor) to pay up. I don't agree to this model since I can't see what added value it would give me. It feels like a pay wall.

Online: 0/10

With all this said, do I recommend it? Yep, I do. Without a doubt. And I think if they get rid of that silly online subscription model, this game will have many more years going for it.",1452982677,1452982677,True,7,0,0.555588781833648682,0,True,False,False

Paying a yearly sum to play online is going to piss some people off and im not going there are this point in time as i can play R3E, Project cars , Assetto Corsa, SCE , and more online when i buy the game.

If you loved RFactor 1 you will get into RFactor 2 and at least in steam/workshop the less experianced can keep track of updating and modding a bit easier. The learning curve is steeper and more rewarding to drive cars to the limit.

The graphics are not as good as they are in the video, and I have a very high-end PC. The NASCARs are not licensed, and therefore have been changed, and look like kids toys (Not a good thing) The cars are difficult to drive, and spin whenever you go near the throttle, and the crash graphics are the worst I've seen in a car game for a long time

Dont get me wrong, this game has done some things right-The car and track selection range is pretty big, and there are mods out there (Although the community is not very active) And when you do manage to get them moving, the cars handle very realistically.

Overall, If this game was a lot cheaper, it would be amazing, but I am disappointed that I paid $44 Australian for this, and it did not meet expectations. I am going to reccomend this game, because I trust that it is better than it seems at first, And will change this review  if I can get some assitance.

Pros:
Clearly one of the best physics engines
Has all the ""essential"" racing sim features that other games like AC are still missing
AI cant be worse than AC, PCARS

Cons:
Quality of the official content (some of which downloaded via ISI workshop) seemed all over the place. Some tracks had super low resolution mesh so felt like driving a 20 year old game, a couple of cars felt bad too, although maybe I was driving those on tracks that didn't have the real road feature enabled and it fell back to some other track grip mode (either way this in itself is a problem and annoying to have to check when going from one track to another).

Workshop is missing a lot of the ""must have"" mods (mp server browser full of stuff not on there)
Having random users upload the modders work is not ideal, and there arent enough reviews on the stuff that is there to tell if its worth trying

Paying for an mp subscription when the public mp is dead is also odd... you have to join a league/club to play online which is fine, but why do I need to pay ISI for that?

UI isnt that nice, but its functional and easy to find stuff

Some inconsistency with sounds, didnt notice any collision sounds in several cars that i tried",1448975699,1448975699,False,6,0,0.506539046764373779,1,True,False,False

rfactor2 is the most realistic racing simulation at this moment.

But: On this Steam Version, just a very limited combination of cars and tracks does not lead to a crash (rfactor2 has stopped worked...).

When the crashes are fixed I will change this review and write something about the game :)

UPDATE 1: Day Later: Now the source of the problem seems to be obvious: When I start the game now it says ""Downloading Workshop Items - 59 items remaining"". This situation does not change after an hour, so there is a problem to download the content. This is why most tracks and cars do not work as they have not been downloaded yet. As rFactor2 is not able to download them (I just use the official Workshop Mods which are subscribed by default), this review will stay negativ until the game has been fixed

UPDATE 2: Now I have reinstalled the game the second time. This time, I installed it to my normal HDD (not SSD). The reason for this was, that my Steam Folder on the SSD was unter C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam. So, maybe the (x86) was a problem for rfactor2, that it cant download to a location with special letters. Now everything works fine, my Steam Folder on my HDD is ""D:\Games\Steam"". Maybe this was a reason. I hope that the game will gun smoothly on the HDD and wont lod too long :)",1447457924,1448610344,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

The starting wheel and car set up are so far off, it feels nothing like a sim.  And after dorking with the set up for a bit, the feeling has gotten better but know where near realistic.  When you cant get a car not to spin out and or loose control at 60 mph, simply because your breaking, (which btw, there is zero feedback for breaking) it leads to nothing but frustration.  There is also a button for the rev limiter but seemingly none of the cars have it, and like a real sim, they have zero tollerance for speeding in the pits, which in turn is just more frustration because even in practice you have to come in and serve your penelty, or be DQ. I have not tried Project Cars or Corrsa, but IMO Raceroom, and I racing are much better because the feedback and sense of speed is way more spot on to RL, and the car's actualy feels like it has tires.  The concept with the throw back cars and tracks are neat, and maybe I just need to tweak on the control setup more, but at this point and time, I really wish I would of tried the Demo because I feel like I wasted my fifty plus bucks on a game that is going to the garage.",1448127155,1448127155,False,6,12,0.394897788763046265,2,True,False,False

It's got the best road course AI out there.  They can actually be raced and had fun with unlike my experience with Assetto Corsa and Project Cars.  This game like rFactor 1 before it is about deep customization.  I like that I can setup races that go a set number of laps or if I want to race a specific amount of time and I can set the races to being timed races.   The FFB and tire model make the cars feel more realistic to me than any game I've driven.  The first time I figured out my FF started vibrating during a race because I'd flatspotted my tires was pretty awesome.  Real Road that has rubber build up added to the racing surface depending on where the cars are actually driving during the race is pretty cool as well.  The only other game which currenly has something like that is iRacing and they just added it a month or two ago.  

I also love the night racing or racing at dusk into the night.  This is also something very few games have ever had and something most of the current games do not have.

If you're not sure you'll like this game then try the demo.  Hardcore racing simulations aren't for everyone.  Personally I like driving the slower cars because they're easier to handle.  You should also try the demo because it's true the UI can be unfriendly to people who just want to get in and drive.  It was designed at a time when PC gamers were more into tinkering with their games and machines to get the most out of them without the user manual being part of the UI.  Something that's never really made sense is there are several useful settings in a text file in the game folder that aren't in the UI.

There is a fair amount of content, really a lot when including mods, and it all feels solid. 
I'm not going to comment on the physics and realism in comparison to other sims, 
everyone has their own opinion on this anyway.

I will say though that it is harder to get to grips with than the other racing sims I have tried but  it is also more rewarding when you start to get the feel of it.
