1190000,103969973,76561198126365210,0,48,2057,0,2057,1706618328,"Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is the latest entry in the popular simulation series that lets players run their own car repair shop. The game features over 70 licensed cars, 4000 unique parts, and various tools and stations to work on different aspects of the vehicles. The game aims to provide a realistic and immersive experience of car mechanics, from simple oil changes to complex engine rebuilds.

The game has two main modes: career and sandbox. In career mode, players start with a basic garage and take on various jobs from customers, earning money and reputation. The jobs range from easy to hard, and require different skills and tools to complete. Some jobs are straightforward, such as replacing a battery or a brake pad, while others are more challenging, such as diagnosing a faulty part or restoring a junk car. The game also offers optional objectives and bonuses for completing jobs faster or with higher quality.

In sandbox mode, players have access to all the cars, parts, tools, and stations in the game, and can work on them freely without any time or money constraints. This mode is ideal for those who want to experiment with different cars and customizations, or just enjoy the process of fixing and tuning cars. Players can also buy and sell cars in the auction house, or test drive them on the race track.

The game's graphics are impressive, with detailed models of cars and parts, realistic lighting and shadows, and smooth animations. The game also has a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle, which add to the immersion and variety. The sound effects are authentic and satisfying, with the sounds of wrenches, hammers, engines, and tires. The game also has a relaxing soundtrack that fits the mood of the game.

The game's controls are intuitive and easy to use, with the mouse and keyboard or a controller. The game's interface is clear and informative, with helpful hints and tutorials for beginners. The game also has a comprehensive encyclopedia of cars and parts, which can be accessed at any time.

The game's main drawback is its repetitiveness and lack of innovation. The game does not offer much new content or features compared to its predecessor, Car Mechanic Simulator 2018. The game's core gameplay loop remains the same, with players doing the same tasks over and over again. The game's difficulty curve is also uneven, with some jobs being too easy or too hard for the player's level. The game's mini-games, such as repairing parts, balancing tires, or washing cars, are also simplistic and tedious, and do not add much to the game's fun factor.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is a solid upgrade for the series, but not a revolutionary one. The game is a must-have for car enthusiasts and fans of the genre, who will appreciate the game's realism, diversity, and customization. The game is also a good choice for casual players and newcomers, who will find the game relaxing, educational, and enjoyable. However, the game is not for everyone, as it can be boring, frustrating, and monotonous for those who are not interested in car mechanics or simulation games.",1637882740,1708902674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main thing I don't like is that it's made in Unity but besides that main one, it's not as 'realistic' as it claims to be. Think of this game as more of a ""Sim-Cade"" instead of a true ""Simulator"", I say this because while it has aspects of a simulator it is mostly based as an arcade game and leaves more difficult things like electrical cable management out

I enjoy the game and it and the revamped level progression in CMS21 is much better than CMS18

The biggest let down is the lackluster car sounds. You spend hours polishing and repairing each part, making it glimmer, and then you take it for a test drive only for your minty $300,000 car to sound like a leaf blower.

1. If you're looking to increase your car mechanics knowledge this game is for you. Play a good amount of hours, then inspect a car in real life and you're going to easily recognize its components.
2. This game is great to waste hours and relax. There are different ways you can play this game. Personally i like to grab cars from junkyard and make them new and shiny.
3. If you grab the Drag Racing DLC you're going to have fun tuning your cars so that they can perform against other cars in drag race.
4. The only thing that's missing from this game in my opinion is a city environment where you can drive your car and enjoy it as if it was really yours, this makes it almost pointless to own cars in the game. Would be amazing to get in your car, get on the road and drive until the city or whatever (there is some material on the workshop though). That would make great multiplayer content aswell. Nontheless you can use your cars to do laps in the race track, go in the speed track, test track or drag racing (DLC) which can be fun.

Overall if you like to mount and unmount stuff, repair things (or create) to make them shiny new or in good condition, and you want to expand your cars knowledge I highly recommend this game to you.",1707670813,1707670813,True,12,0,0.662162125110626221,0,True,False,False

Not a big change and it's my opinion it's not worth creating and selling a whole new game for the minimal amount of items added which could have easily been added to 2018 as DLC. Now if you had CMS 2018 and purchased this new version you have to spend money to repurchase all the DLC over again which I don't like, the whole package makes me feel like i am being taken to the bank just to play the same game. the whole shop set up looks a bit different but who cares.

I think we could do with out the mini games within items like the tire balance which is now more unrealistic then prior and you get locked into the action while the tire is being balanced and can't walk away and do something else. I kind of liked that you had to wait a short period while the tire was being balanced and could go do something else and return to retrieve your balanced tires. And the CMS2018 tire balancer even sounded spot on.

I like the scraping idea yet i have upgraded many parts and then while doing it items are upgraded yet they show that there is no gain in value to anything from what i see it shows 0% prior to and after upgrading parts so what is the sense of it all and once again you have to sit through this painful mini game just to scrap parts, I hate it. They should add a feature so you can shut off all mini games if you don't like them which from reading in the suggestion area is most people, not sure what the developers were thinking there.

All in all it's OK especially if you never purchased CMS 2018 but for some one like me who owns CMS 2018 and put countless hours of game play into it you feel like you have been taken advantage of and for the most part sold the same game at a higher price and left to repurchase all the same DLC you own in CMS 2018. I see this new culture arising especially on steam where a developers creates a game and then instead of progressing the game they just stop adding new content and then for the most part create the same game and call it a new version with a few new items.

Some simulation games suffer from the ""what now?"" issue, but not CMS. The cycle of buy junker --> renovate junker --> sell for five figures of profit is insanely addicting. Taking your first car to the speed and race tracks makes you want to build your second one even better. Doing jobs starts out as a frustrating experience and becomes a satisfying puzzle as you play. ""What the heck is wrong?"" turns into ""This problem is so simple that they shouldn't have gone to a mechanic,"" and from there the dopamine hit of knowing what's wrong without even checking is epic. That being said, I recommend checking CMS forums if you're a new player and forgot where your fuel rail goes for the fifth time.

DLC is there but not mandatory for the game to be enjoyable. All 40 hours of game play as of this review being posted were done entirely base game, and I see many more hours of enjoyment ahead without DLC.

I personally don't mind this, but some die-hard mechanics might not like the simplicity of certain aspects of the cars. For example, you don't bleed brake lines and some components (battery, fluid reservoirs, etc) float around and aren't necessarily connected to anything. It doesn't negatively impact the game play, but don't use this game as a training module for real-life repairs.",1707443917,1707443917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get a little burned out as you move along in the game. 

I don't mind doing the brakes or change the oil the first time is fine but when you have the later scenarios where you're rebuilding an engine having to do the beginning stuff all over again is boring.

The game itself is pretty enjoyable up to a point when you realize that the only thing that makes this worth playing for over 20 hours is the DLC. The DLCs are extremely overpriced when you take into account that mods are free. The only DLC really worth paying for is the drag racing dlc because they didn't just add races, they took an important part of building a raceworthy vehicle (carb/ecu tuning) and locked it behind a paywall. The driving mechanics are terrible when you consider that any indie game that's ever existed has had better vehicle control than this mess. What's the point of building your own vehicles if you can't drive them without ripping your hair out because the physics are incredibly poor. And what's with the lack of content lately? Adding a few new parts to build like 2-3 cars from a new manufacturer and then keeping it as a paid DLC really doesn't improve the game. There have been no free base game content updates since its conception. Why hasn't there been an overhaul for visuals in the 2 and a half years this game has been out? Everything is still just rust. You already have a pouring animation for fluids, why not animate oil leaks into the game. And why are we still playing a minigame for repairs?

I would appreciate random ""pop up"" tips, that you could turn on or off or perhaps a tool (a question mark) that you could use to get random knowledge about all these various things (their basic function and more). Like if you're changing the coolant (just an example) a tip could educate the player what the coolant is for. And that you could use water as a temporary measure if you're not in a cold climate. And perhaps say why it's important for the engine. The sum of both playing around with the different parts and getting tips every now and then, would be amazing, for anyone who is just starting out to learn about cars. You could maybe even set it to ""beginner tips"" or ""intermediate tips"" or ""pro tips"" ... or a mixture of them all. Or... maybe a sidekick that you could talk to in real time and ask questions. Oh and multiplayer would be great too. 

Anyway, love this simulator and I say simulator because it's more than ""a game"". It's highly educational. I'd love it even more if it had a 2016 Land Rover Discovery Sport or a 1992 Ford Explorer so I could learn about my own cars. In a perfect world it would have ALL of the cars. ALL of them.

I think other reviews here have said it better. The entire game is clicking and holding on stuff and watching stiff and simple animations play out, that's it. Diagnosing a problem is as basic as just looking at the health% of a part and buying a new one. 

The engine bays are also of questionable authenticity. The 2017 Ford Mustang in the Ford DLC is all over the place, fluid reservoirs and fuse box are in the wrong place and are generically modeled. There is a fluid reservoir for power steering that shouldn't even be there because this car has electric power steering.

Not only that, the DLCs for the game are super affordable and totally worth it. However, if you do buy the DLCs, I suggest buying the mega pack rather than just getting a few of them individually, since having only one or two doesn't make a big difference on the gameplay. I also heavily recommend checking out the workshop, it's a great way to find a car you can't find in the game. that's all I have to say on the game though, sorry if I went on for a long time, but I totally suggest the game!",1704894474,1706683562,True,8,0,0.63113713264465332,0,True,False,False

i'll give you an example of a car i  just purchased at the auction. i paid roughly 10K for the car through bidding against AI. sometimes you get a decent deal and most other times you take a slight loss. condition wise i had to buy new parts for about 80% of the car which is very unrealistic. and the prices seem very high.

as far as detail in the car it is nice but could use some improvement.

i do like to take on jobs and upgrading tools and the shop in general is nice.

i did make some repaints of cars and i do not recommend it for most. most all the cars are hard to paint because the parts are all strung out. they should have aligned the parts as they are displayed. for instance a whole side of the car as you would see it facing it. it is very hard to align stripes for example. so they made what should be an easy job hard. it's a shame because i do like custom painting cars and adding different stripes.

i do hope they offer a new game in the future with improvements. i would like to see more realism and an easier method of making custom liveries. an auction service to buy parts would be a nice touch with the ability to buy used engines and other parts. this way you could fix them for better profits. they also need to add much better accounting. i never really know what my profit margins really are. this way you could keep proper business records. and we are in business to make a profit. knowing how much you made is a big part of the satisfaction for your efforts.",1629594202,1706548920,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Well you see me play a lot of racing games but truth is I honestly love it when I can get to work with cars and especially when I get a little chance to look at their engines and do some work on them. Car mechanic simulator gives me that oppertunity, well since I don't really work as a mechanic, but it was a big childhood dream of mine to actually become one. Cars were a huge passion of mine growing up so it is cool to have a game where I can sort of do that very thing I love to do. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LItf50CpH0M
- The soundtrack is also pretty good, I honestly like how much freedom and content there is here I will be looking forward to continue my journey in it. There are lots of cars with different specs, engines and objectives you need to fix for various clients, I like that honestly since I am not entirely a newbie when it comes to cars myself so I am familiar with a few things when it comes to how you work on them in real life.

What i like is how relaxed it is,  that you can store your cars in a garage and looking through the junkyard for nice goodies.

What i dont like is that as soon as playway releases the base game,  they pump it full of DLC.   
The workshop content is fun, but it is also broken. Since i have cars from the workshop in my game,  im a millionaire just for buying parts in the junkyard and selling them straight away.
Now that they released the RIMS DLC,   i find myself writing this report.
To me,  it feels like the DLC content is not worthy of paying for, they are small extra bits,   2 cars here,   1 car there etc...
Now they make us pay for 80 rims in a pack.   Im sorry,  but that does it for me.  This stuff should be free,  they are too small of a content to pay for,  and they are too frequent to be taken serious.  This should all be free,  we payed for an incomplete game.

Generally, I really enjoy the game and it's a good way to destress after a long day, definitely worth the money. But there are some things that could be better, especially UI and not locking things behind DLC (a problem Simulator genre as a whole experiences).

[h3]What I liked[/h3]
Now, I am not a motor-head and knew absolutely nothing about cars before playing this game, of course, except for the fact that they have 4 wheels and an engine :D . But this game taught me a lot about what makes up the car and really made me realise that we as humanity tricked a bunch of metal to move us from Point A to Point B. So yeah, I think this game can be a great way to learn about cars, especially when you do not have a car to disassemble yourself. This game also relaxes me- I feel that I can tackle orders at my own pace and make a playthrough my own, without needing to prove anything to anyone, which is a great quality for a game and a gamer like me. With a game this open ended, it's easy to set your own goals, which is another great quality of this game, and simulator/tycoon genre in general. I also did not experience any major bugs in my almost 20 hours of playing, which is a big plus.

[h3]What could have been better[/h3]
- UI- the main menu looks a little too simplistic and the crates you get for completing story orders are simply textures, to show that they open, rather than an animation. 
- The soundtrack is pretty limited and among the 3 radio stations, all music sounds exactly the same. I appreciate the option to turn off the music though, I enjoy the game without it more anyway. But if you want music, just play your own playlist off a music service. 
- Money management- I felt like it can be a little difficult (playing on Normal difficulty) to manage expenses if you do not know what you're doing. I had to restart my progress because unknowingly I spent money on upgrades and ended up not having enough money to complete story orders. Side orders hardly pay anything, depending on complexity and bonuses, of course. I wish there was some kind of loan system, or simply increase payouts/reduce prices. But at the same time, it's not necessarily a negative as difficulty to make profit can provide a great challenge to keep going forward and keep coming back to the game.

[h3]What I disliked[/h3]
- DLCs- This is a problem the entire genre suffers as a whole, rather than this game, but I find that a lot of the content that is said to enhance the gameplay is locked behind DLCs that you have to purchase separately- as if you haven't already paid £20 for the game! Some content, such as Drag racing and Electric cars should have been part of the base game to begin with, in my opinion. And speaking of Electric Cars- I bought the DLC as I felt like it was the only one that would enhance the game, but only 2 ECs spawned in my gameplay with the DLC active, which is insignificant. Other DLCs- I felt like big brand car packs would not add much value to the existing game but correct me if I am wrong.

[h3]Verdict[/h3]
I give this game a solid 8/10. If more ECs (that I paid for) spawned and UI was a little better, the score would for sure be higher.

[h3]Helpful tips if you want to play[/h3]
When starting out, focus only on Story orders, and side orders that pay bonus CR. Do not bother with garage upgrades/tools (unless needed to complete the story order) and spend your skill points on Discounts, so you make more profit. As I mentioned in my What could have been better point, money is pretty tight in this game, so use it wisely. If possible, you could cheese it by getting parts from the Junkyard, but it is very much down to RNG.

The biggest rant I have its having to repurchase any DLC/brands that I want but I learned that on the 2nd iteration.  So I went from buying all of them to only the 1 I care about as I can go backwards to the other versions if I want them. 

The biggest flaw is the driving, it just is...laughable in physics and purpose.  All the cars sound the same and drive like a potato.  It just really has no purpose other than potentially figuring out what is wrong...but should be done via the path instead anyway.  I'd be ok if it was totally removes so developer time/resources could do more to the game.  

I didn't like the hours I had to spend to deconstruct items and the minigame.  I can tolerate all the rest (brakes, wheels(loved!), body), but the scraps I HATED!!!

Positives:

+ Graphics are improvement compared to the older one. 

+ relays, brake fluids, coolant, power steering fluid (might get repetitive later on but I love that they added these)

+ better car roster (in my opinion), cars are much more true to their real life counterparts.

+ / - better dlc, for some this might be on the negative side because you have to pay for dlc but I honestly think they are worth it especially if you get them on sale.

Now for the negative sides of the game, currently haven't found really anything negative about the game but I do have one gripe

Negative:

- Early game is SUPER SLOW even compared to cms18. Feels like unscrewing speed and screw speed overall is decreased by 50 %, although this could be only me.

I haven't tested the repairing / part placement issue though - as this just seems pointless these days (once you get past a certain level, repairing peoples cars beocmes pointless). 

However, it's still pretty much just a money grab game. The DLCs are absolute garbage. Even the drag race DLC is just pathetic. You'd hope for an actual drag racing competition, like it advertises, but it's actually just a bunch of AI cars that are not *quite* as good as your car....

I'd still recommend not buying. 

***DO NOT BUY YET***


Pretty much an exact clone of Simulator 2018. They've added a couple of minor things, but they haven't done much to improve the game at all. On top of that, they've added a dozen things that break the game. Here's a list of reasons you shouldn't buy the game

1. As noted: this is about 95% the same as Sim 2018. All that's different are the cars and some minor changes to repair/etc. 

2. The ""minimum repair %"" breaks the game, as you have to know exactly where every item came from originally - whether it static or not. This means that if you put one - just one - of the 16 camshaft caps in the wrong place, you have to pull them out and start again. Don't get me started on how frustrating this is if you put the wrong piston in the wrong spot. And the only way to fix this is by using highlighting - which doesn't work if you remove the engine to work on it. It's not realistic (sure, a mechanic will need to be pretty careful with moving parts, but a lot less careful with static parts), and it just makes the game unenjoyable. 

3. They haven't added any of the useful improvements to the game that you'd have expected. For example.  In 2018 there was no way to tie repairing/building a vehicle with the junkyard. IF you have a list of 50 parts you want - you'll need to write them down on a piece of paper / notepad, and then go to the junk yard. This could have been fixed SO FUCKING EASILY  by just having the shopping list be accessible from the junkyard. 

4. And to top the above off, there's no borderless full screen, so if you have a separate screen with a notepad on it, then you'll need to use non-full screen mode, or just minimize each time. Which is just fucking stupid

There are more things which I can touch on, but this is a good start.

On the positive side, you can just click on an item in your shopping list to go straight to it on the shopping page. I didn't know this until about level 13, so I was a bit pissed, but it's good to know...",1632443504,1703722560,False,4,0,0.527030885219573975,2,True,False,False

Long version:
Got it for about 14 bucks and honestly 22 hours to beat it is fair for the price, but I feel like I'm wishing for more. I got sick with covid the day I got this so was isolated in my house and managed to beat this game in about 2 days, fully refurbished the Lamborghini Diablo, beat the race track and the main story. Fully upgraded the car garage, went into over 30 barns, was really just burning right through the game to be fair, but it be nice if there was more to do.

It lacks a certain replay-ability and endgame, after you have rebuilt 1 or 2 cars you have rebuilt them all, and lots of the missions feel tedious or identical to the main quest. On-top of this once you unlock the skill that lets you estimate the value of cars money is never an issue again because you can buy cars and instantly resell them for massive profit, making all the quests pretty much pointless.

Game quickly wen't from a cool simulation into an almost sandbox game (on normal that is). It delivers exactly what it says it will but unless you REALLY like rebuilding the same few engines over and over there's really only 20-30 hours here, which is fair, but all in all I give the game a solid 7/10. Would love some attention to the end game and economy to make this a game I can sink hundreds of hours into, but for what it is, it's a very solid game and probably the best car building game out at the moment.",1703393771,1703393771,True,4,0,0.581749022006988525,0,True,False,False

it certainly has some educational value, and its nice to look around the cars and play with the parts. its silly in places (you can ""repair"" a clutch friction disc as if it was a brake rotor), and missing a lot of details, but thats all fine, its a game, not a technical manual.

what killed it for me, in the end, is the lack of real control over anything. you just remove parts and add parts in sequence, and do almost no diagnosis or anything interesting. in order to remove pistons, you must disassemble the head. not remove, disassemble. cam rockers and everything have to come completely apart, if you want to replace piston rings. its tedious and frustrating.

its fine for what it is, and if you're looking to click on car parts for a moment, you'll be happy. but if you want anything intelligent out of this 'game', forget it. as a game, its barely more than a cookie clicker.",1703092736,1703092736,False,5,0,0.535714268684387207,0,True,False,False

I've repaired dozens of cars - several rebuilt from the ground up - and it never gets old. Whether stocking up on parts from the junkyard to store for later or building a car from the first bolt, the interface is intuitive and the building very satisfying. 

Featuring a dyno for performance tuning, a paint shop, an area to ensure your tires and headlights are aligned, upgradable parts in the shop, engine swap opportunities, custom tires and wheel combinations and all the items in the trailers above, I'm yet to find a flaw. You may occasionally zoom in on the wrong part and get your view out of whack, but a simple pan out or re-selecting the proper part will set you straight.

I have recently added the Porsche, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Lotus and Pagani DLCs. The first 3 of those boast the most content, but the others are also solid, plus the Paganis will sell for the most by far when repaired.

Unfortunately, this game lost me from the very first car. To change the oil, the game makes you unscrew the oil drain plug, drain the engine oil pan into the drain pan, then PUT AWAY THE DRAIN PAN before it lets you remove the oil filter. Any 17-year-old vocational student who's ever done an oil change knows you leave the drain pan in place, since removing the filter releases a ton of used oil!

The DLC officially licensed cars are great and all the things you can do to the cars as far as fixing, building and tuning is top notch! But in my opinion the game is lacking a few key features. 

#1 Transmission/Gearbox rebuilds.

#2 More replaceable exterior items (e.g. windshield wipers, headlight and taillight bulbs, radio antennas etc.)

3. More in depth interior customization (e.g. seat color and material type, dashboard/rearview mirror items e. g. fuzzy dice and sunglasses.)

4. More in depth tuning options (e.g. replacing carburetor jets, tuning turbochargers and superchargers, as well as allowing for twin turbo and twin turbo supercharged engine setups!

5. More engine swap options on more cars, as well as AWD, RWD, 4x4 and FWD drivetrain swaps
(Let's be honest who doesn't want to make the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift Mustang with a Nissan RB26 R-34 engine in it?!!)

6. More Paint booth options (e.g. applying decals, stickers, vinyls and custom paint schemes.)

7. More officially licensed vehicles as well as more varied options (e.g. a monster truck or Dragster would be sick.)

Other than those few cons the game is incredibly fun and will keep you entertained for hours on end!!!",1701569227,1701569227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game provides an immersive and detailed experience for automotive enthusiasts, offering a deep dive into the world of car restoration and customization.

One of the game's standout features is its attention to detail in recreating the intricate mechanics of real-world cars. The comprehensive list of available car models, each with authentic components and a variety of issues to address, provides a genuine sense of being a hands-on mechanic. The level of realism in the repair and restoration process, from disassembling engines to tuning and testing, adds a layer of authenticity that car aficionados will appreciate.

The game's user interface is intuitive, making it accessible to both experienced mechanics and those new to the genre. The well-organized garage, comprehensive toolset, and straightforward tutorial system guide players through the complex tasks of automotive repair and restoration without overwhelming them.

The addition of a photo mode allows players to capture and share their customized and restored vehicles, adding a creative touch to the gameplay. The in-game economy, where players can buy and sell cars, parts, and completed projects, adds a layer of strategy and progression that keeps the experience engaging.

While Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 excels in replicating the intricate world of car repair, it may lack the storytelling or broader objectives found in other simulation games. The gameplay loop, while satisfying for enthusiasts, might not have the same universal appeal as more narrative-driven experiences.

In conclusion, Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is a solid entry in the genre, offering an authentic and engaging experience for those with a passion for cars. Whether you're a seasoned mechanic or just curious about the intricacies of vehicle repair, this simulator provides a satisfying journey through the virtual garage, making it a noteworthy addition to the Car Mechanic Simulator series.",1701106693,1701106693,True,0,0,0.479797959327697754,0,True,False,False

Even most of dlc cars are the same which feels like a money grab considering that you gotta spend almost 100$ to get the whole content.  cms2021 still suffers from the same problems: terrible user interface, annoying camera work, overall huge lack of quality of life improvements. Diagnostic tools have slow animations, same with manual examination. I was about to fall asleep while watching same boring animations. Economy is also shit. You get so little money for fixing cars that you quickly start looking for alternatives and then you realize right away that there is no point in doing anything else than flipping car you buy from auctions. 1h job can give you profit of around 2k while flipping a car even 10 times more within a minute. Driving model is same bad. I was super hyped for the game but now I'm super disappointed.

My biggest issue with the game is the audio design - it's *exactly* the same as the 2015 version - no joke, everything from loosening the nuts/screws to filling in fluids. By now I would've expected different SFX when pouring motor oil, windshield fluid or literally any other fluid - they're the exact same sound despite having different viscosity 

To add, I was so disappointed when I drove the cars on the race track... The sound is a pain to the ear and the handling is atrocious and uncharacteristic even after wheel alignment, it's just not fun. Many mobile racing games do this part better which is a shame imo

I loved finding cool cars in barns or in auctions so I can fix 'em up all the way to perfect condition - hell, I love installing every performance part that I can possibly fit, but having those HP and Torque numbers go up mean nothing when it's not fun to drive or race either way

I bought a bolt hellcat at the junkyard for around $6,000, put about $30,000 into it, and sold for $60,000. The previous game would have sold for $100,000+ and it somewhat made it too easy/relaxed. It adds more of a ""challenge"". I've ran out of money while doing a job, and had to sell a junkyard car that I had recently purchased at a $2000 loss just to finish it.

 I have some mechanical background and some game design this is very well done. It is as accurate as can be expected for a game built for a very technical occupation.
 Sure there are things that are not as realistic as real life but this is not real life and meant to create interest in what it would take to do this and gives general knowledge of how things are done, in what general order.
 Plus the idea sometimes things just can't be fixed so must be replaced with some new parts.

Due to some of the DLC's and Workshop mods, the game is infinitely replayable, and can be very rewarding after each finish of a car. I love the in depth models of the vehicles, and the accuracy of the parts to the real thing. 

Some parts of this game could use some reworking, however. 

- I feel the bodywork is very limited, and it could use a little bit more spicing up. (Such as more body panels, pieces of the chassis and body underneath the panels being removable, and more in depth damage to the body and parts).

- The Driving is very rushed. You can only drive on certain small tracks, and the physics feel very choppy. Cars with high horsepower can spin out really easily, and you cant ease into the throttle due to the limitations of the keyboard. Also when driving on tracks, if you crash your car there is no consequence. Even a damage toggle in settings would be interesting, as it would add a more personal feeling to your vehicles. The last thing to complete the driving aspect would be the addition of open world driving. This is a bit far-fetched, but being able to drive around a city (even if it is empty), would be very neat especially in the car that you just spent a few hours rebuilding. All of these together would make for a more immersive and personal experience, with stuff such as regular maintenance of your vehicles after use or accidents.||

- Live Auction House, where online players can go and bid on other's vehicles, and list their own. Along side the in game auction house, this would make selling your car more fun, and buying cars with specific tunes and such easier, as long as they can pay for it. cars can be bid on infinitely, and people could also list for a BIN. This would also add an alternative to the basic ""sell car"" feature in game, as it could allow people to sell their car for more money, if they can wait for someone to buy it. 

- More Add-ons, Engine swaps, addition of car lifting and lowering, splitters, and extra customization to allow people to create their own dream car easier. 

Now, even though i have written a whole essay above on improvements, those are simply my opinion and some are a little far-fetched, even outrageous. All in all, this is a wonderful game and i would highly reccomend you pick it up when it's on sale (which it is every month and a half or so) if you are interested in cars and auto mechanics.",1698119304,1698119304,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Dents

Car Wash

What is missing most for me is any level of multiplayer. I'd settle for being able to download someone else's saved lap on a track to just give me another car to look at while I'm driving.

I only recently bought 2018 when it went on sale on Steam, and I felt like after I had reached the point where I could afford to go to auctions and restore cars, all I was really doing was a lot unscrewing, purchasing and rescrewing to look at a car mod I'd downloaded.

I like the core experience of the game, but find myself wanting more. Can I compete against another garage (even if it's AI?). Can I advertise or upgrade the exterior to try to attract more customers? Can I hire people to do the mindless grunt work while I focus on running and expanding the business? How can you be a good garage if you don't answer 99% of the service calls? Why aren't I building relationships with my customers? Shouldn't I occasionally host or attend some kind of classic car auto show?

I see it as a type of puzzle game, trying to find new parts, and then trying to figure out where all the parts are meant to go. You can take jobs from customers, find old broken down cars that need a lot of work, or cars that need a few things done, then sell them, or keep them. You can take pictures of the cars you have worked on.It's very relaxing. The only thing that I would like, is when you look at the list of things that need doing on the car, you can have the option to add all of the parts to the shopping list from the parts needed list.

I'm getting eye strain headaches every day, but does that stop me? Of course not. I just finally reached a point of closing the game willingly after 51.4 hours; well worth full price, let alone the price I paid on sale (I got the main game and several of the expansions.). I probably should have expected this after Thief Simulator so captured my attention, but I never learn.

If you're at all interested in mechanics or understanding how engines work, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's not completely realistic, there are a lot more parts on real cars (and in real life there's this thing called transmission fluid that would need to be drained when opening the gearboxes), but if you only have a general idea of how engines are built, you will learn more about how complex they are and maybe understand more about the engineering behind them.

Although they do remove all the wiring and hoses from the cars. It would be nice if they included the major ones, like the radiator hoses. 

The shop customization is great, but the repair and salvage parts are lacking. For the repair, I wish they would let you break down the individual parts and replace minor things like wiring and orings, etc. Actually rebuild the part and not just play a mini game. Repair seems more of an after thought compared to the rest of the game. I also wish the warehouse was more integrated into the game. Right now it's just extra space. It would be nice if your computer/tablet contained a program that would show you your inventory.

They go really detailed with the engines, but not so much with the transmission or front/rear differentials. I don't have any DLCs yet, but I didn't see any notes on these being implemented. I saw the manual transmission was added with one of the DLCs.

It would also be helpful to have an app that would show the readouts of all the diagnostic. I know it'll flag the parts that are bad because of the checklist, but not the parts that don't meet the minimum standard. I would like to see the status of all the parts I checked, in a list,, versuses just looking at the part.

Buying parts is instantaneous. It would be kind of neat if they implemented a timing system. It takes x amount of hours for the part to arrive. This would delay the repair of the vehicle and then have your customers call and pesture as to why their car isn't done yet. Then you could put a chain link fence off to the side and store all the cars not repaired yet. That would give you a proper mechanic immersion. 

I know I out a lot of wants and nice to have ideas in the review, but it doesn't diminish the quality ofbthe game. It it is well done and very enjoyable to play.",1696782650,1696782650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can't properly diagnose what's wrong with the car without buying every tool, you can't buy every tool without money, you can't earn money if you don't finish a job, you can't finish a job because you don't have all the tools. Progression in this game is completely abysmal.

It's fun and engaging when a list is provided or when you can test drive the car or use tools and obd scanner to find out what's wrong. Jobs should be locked off until you have the tools to diagnose the problem.

EDIT: On inspect mode you can click and hold to inspect A FEW parts, but you still need the tools to get the whole picture

Story quests should be blocked until you have X amount of money to work on the car, without delving into the job you have no idea how much money you'll sink into it. It's easy to run out of money in the middle of a car fix and then having to take 20 fluid/filters jobs to buy the parts to keep working on the first job

Some of the story missions are interesting, it would be nice to get a little message of thanks when you finish a story job though. It would be much more immersive and it's nice to be thanked for doing a good job (I get really sucked into being the mechanic)

The only main things I have an issue with are below:

- I'm almost max level and getting parts from the junkyard to salvage is just not worth it.
I recently decided to go to the junkyard and pick up everything. I repaired what I could and salvaged the rest.
It took me nearly 2 hours. 
There needs to be an auto repair or auto salvage at higher levels. It's just not worth anyone spending enormous amounts of time on the mini-game to save a few credits.
Time is money after all.

- The above leads into the issue with the Warehouse. What's the point of having it if you can't use anything in there without it being in your inventory?
At the bare minimum, I'd like a little icon when installing a part, to show if you have one in stock in the back room. That way, I'd use it all the time. At the moment I'm lugging around 200+ parts that I repaired just so I know I have them.

- The Dyno doesn't do any explaining on how to use it. I've no idea how to tune a gearbox and I struggle with it. From what I've read elsewhere, other people struggle too. Great for people who know what they're doing. Not at all intuitive for people who don't, which means we just won't use it.

- If you have a race track, you need to fix the driving mechanics because they're incredibly clunky. I get it's not a racing sim and I respect that because the mechanics side is wildly fun, it's just a thought. Also races would be great if that's an area you would delve into in the future.

In summary, this is an excellent game that I can relax and play for hours on end. It just needs a couple of QoL tweaks to be perfect.

First of all, let me clarify that I absolutely despise this game. I hate it so much that I'm playing it right now as I write this review. My productivity? Gone. My social life? Non-existent. My self-control? Well, let's just say I have about as much self-control as a squirrel at an all-you-can-eat nut buffet.

I wake up in the morning and think to myself, ""Today is the day I'm going to quit 'Car Mechanic Sim...' I've got better things to do!"" But then, just as I'm about to hit that uninstall button, I suddenly realize there's a '73 Mustang waiting for me in the garage. It's like the game knows when I'm weak and vulnerable.

The worst part is, I now have this inexplicable urge to check out real-life car engines. I've started hanging out at auto repair shops, pretending to be knowledgeable about carburetors and camshafts, all because of this hocus-pocused app. 

I hate this so much, I want to quit it like cigarettes, but I can't. It's a game that has turned me into a grease monkey, a car enthusiast, and a procrastinator of epic proportions.",1696021617,1696021617,True,71,81,0.836089015007019043,0,True,False,False

enter game professional mode..
do a bunch of jobs for customers..
get around 50k
go to junk yard and find a jag type f, buy it..
do some more jobs get another 50k
restore the jag with around 750hp..
win every single race at the drag races..
millionaire..
now i have jay lettos garage..
now what? it would be sick if you guys added online drag racing or circuit racing or even pink slip racing then this would easily be game of the decade

I think it's certainly an advantage if you are car savvy, but not a huge one.  There are good tutorials and the game makes it pretty easy to learn what you'll need to know. 
I like the relaxed pace of the game.  You'll get all the time you need to completely tear down that engine, rebuild the suspension, do all the body work you want, and more.  Players take the roll of mechanic in their own, newly opened, garage - doing everything from oil changes to full transmission rebuilds.  The garage can be upgraded to offer new services like window tinting, detailing, diagnostics, and others - and there is a nice variety of awesome tools that make the job easier.
There is even more to do than repair customer's cars:  
Players can also visit junkyards, barns, and auctions to find their own cars to rebuild.  The cars can then be driven on test tracks / race tracks - and then there is even an option to keep them or sell them.  
Players can move through a story (or not) at their own pace, controls are simple to learn and consistent, and the cars and components are highly detailed without being unnecessarily complex.  There are so many different cars and parts that I consider this to be infinitely replayable.  I think this game is for you if you like working on machines, games that involve upgrading, slower paced games, or if taking things apart and putting them back together is interesting / cathartic / fun for you.",1694348008,1694348008,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

very cool game, very mechanics, much wow
games tutorial teaches 3 things and says ""draw the rest of the fucking owl""
from there it drops you quite literally in the middle of the desert without any further guidance
after 5 minutes of struggling with the UI you finally get to taking your first order, yay
then it gives you a checklist of things you need to do to fix the car, understandable
but heres where the baptism through fire begins
want to know where the oil filter is? maybe the fuel pump or air filter? too bad; you thought this was a mechanic simulator? its actually a scavenger hunt simulator
wasnt aware the requirements to play this game were being a real mechanic to know the layout of every engine bay on every model
finally figure out where that pesky oil filter is? sweet! now you gotta memorize the type of oil filter or check your inventory every 2 seconds to remember that exact part to order, find the part in the unorganized part catalog, and even then enjoy getting it wrong and having to go back to the part order 3 more times :)
an extra frustrating element is some of the tasks are literally uncompletable
order came in - replace window washing fluid, ok ez i can do this. nope, game literally didnt let me unscrew the cap
ive done it on 2 other cars but this one wont let you, does it tell you why? no
another order - checklist: tire... what about the tire? does it need to be balanced, maybe new tires altogether, youll never know hee hee but oh, if you want to put new tires on it you cant anyway so get bent
my final complaint is that you cannot get rid of a car unless you complete the tasks - so if the game bugs out and say... doesnt let you put a wheel back on for no reason - your garage is permanently blocked and you have to make a new save file
0/10 being a real mechanic would straight up be less frustrating

Some great DLCs in this version if you like the variety and realism of different brands.  Great attention to detail and the 'feel' and the sounds of the game are realistic enough to get some tunes going and just chill in the garage or look for bargains and projects in the barns and the scrap yard.  The drag racing DLC that features additional tuning options and performance parts is a great addition and adds another element to play style.

- A livery editor, like in Gran Turismo.

- An export functionality to send your cars in BeamNG.

- A way to drive the car right outside the garage. The map could be small. But the spirit of pulling a car out of the garage and drive it right there would be AWESOME. The auction sites, barns and junkyard should be accessible from that map.

With those two things, many guys out there would simply live in that game.

I've only just begun - and as a lover of sim games, I like this one's approach. That said, it feels like an AMAZING 1st step in what could be an amazing mechanic sim game. In fact, I am tempted to buy the DLC just for the fun of working on other vehicles that are more mainstream, but I am still reluctant based on this game missing a lot of details needed to truly be a full ""simulation"" of an auto shop. So, for now, I give this a 5 out of 10 stars (And will update as I get further in), I am glad I waited until it was on sale though - cause it still needs work, and unless the simulation incorporates more reality (like I recommend here) or depending on what the game already has, I am reluctant to tell you to go out and buy the DLCs, too. 

So, here are suggestions, I hope the programmers see this: First, the shop itself: It would be more ""sim"" if we were doing clean-up, getting it osha / hazard safety ready, and ""setting up"" our shop (and I know this is a from scratch shop - but everyone does some basics and improves over time and I'm here to play a sim game - which these days, sim games have lost some of their oomph, but this game's attention to detail on the repairs thus far is so good that it's a shame not to take it to the next level). Next: the operations: while there is some good detail given to the parts replacement: they need to change out their parts buying schema to be more like nexpart multiseller and show the dealer vs client cost (where different vendors may specialize in things like electrical, but multisellers are industry standard and the program should let you enter the car and part and find the vendors for you ... and a simple search online for Autofluent or Shopmonkey will show you how the software works). They need to use a diagnostic tool like Autel for odb reads, key fobs, code clearing, and tpms (etc - and you will see this being done on Youtube even, as this is industry standard now, and is a service in and of itself). I highly recommend they add a Motor or Mitchell1 brand / autofluent style interface for parts/labor costs, schematics, designs, etc. - because that's how mechanics find where parts are located and the steps required (really, every shop has this option because no one person can know everything about every car. And, discovery is time consuming and time is money. And, you can even go on some very reputable websites and find this type of info - so, as this game does cater to ""not real"" mechanics while having some level of reality that I think could be actually educational, adding this feature would be a game changer!! And - if you know a mechanic and mention mitchell1 or Motor or even nexpart- at least in America, they will immediately know what you're talking about). Using this type of in game parts buying interface, Players can also learn to look up cars by license / vin like they do in real life and find the differences in car stats from one model to another (which you can do with the NHTSA right now - for free, so that would be an easy add-in & vin's are either read off by the diagnostic tool or physically/visually). By using Motor brand or Mitchell1 (Motor is preferred these days) software with ""set"" per job labor rates (as is industry standard and should be part of any ""sim"" game), budgeting and even quotes for work could be added (as custom rates are rare and only for ""custom"" jobs in which players could challenge their times and lose money for going over), and this could be easily used to generate a metric of work vs time vs cost vs income (and players could compare themselves / their work to other players and that would be another awesome feature). This could even let players generate invoices and see their monthly accounting - and while that may sound like overkill on detail - once you do that once - you will love it and never go back because... you see how much money you're actually making!! Even hand tools should be *at least* shown for their per job use & ""consumed"" per repair with a 0.01 - 0.03 degrade per tool until 100% and then player has to buy new tools (most shops actually charge a shop tools fee as a % of a job to compensate for tool wear & tear, so this is real life stuff). We should be able to choose from a series of icons (like wrenches, gears, pistons, etc. - easily found using a google search or ai for auto shop iconery) and names and layout styles for the front of our shop to really customize it and make it ""ours"" (we could even have a sign up in the shop, too, showing our shop name and brand icon/logo, on the front door, the street sign out front, and as we build cars, print it on the side of our own custom cars and license plates and that would be ""branding"" and an awesome feature for fun (seriously - you could even let players choose from 1 - 6 colors to represent their ""shop"", hang a uniform with these colors / designs on the wall with the player's name embroidered on it so they get a sense of how they look, and incorporate all of this to really make the experience more ""customized"" per person and that would give a player a sense of personalized ownership in what they were doing - which is the point of owning a mechanic shop vs. being an off-the-shelf mechanic working for someone else). All of these elements are real-life mechanic shop elements that could seriously augment the quality of this as a simulation game. Goals could then be set -> amount of labor time per job is known vs type of job and type of car to estimate which jobs are the best to take on (Motor or even the Napa ProLink online gives that type of info for free) -> the in-game calendar time could be generated, and you could set goals to be achieved like a minimum net income per month by X month based on how many jobs you do per day (a 15 minute oil change vs. a 45 minute diagnostic and wiring job), or a larger goal like opening a second garage by X month, or earning enough money to add new lifts and tools to your current garage, etc. The Autel or other diagnostic tool could incorporate the real life key fob programming - another awesome that can throw this game over the top (and those services could be limited until a key fob is unlocked and the online mfg key programming class passed so that you can't offer that service for the added income until you've earned it). You could use nexpart to choose between parts dealers and get the best list / stock price for you... OR... for your customer (a balance that real life mechanics have to make - which sometimes is as simple as cost + 30%), and that changes how much business you get vs your competition. It's easy to look at Napa ProLink and Autozone Pro online - both free and both offer a lot of the same types of baseline job quoting info to draw from if the programmers don't want to access more serious levels of auto mechanic shop software to draw from. You could also be forced to deal with factory only parts and add new challenges to costs and parts acquisitions for ""custom"" jobs. You could add in scheduling and calendar appointments to force a mechanic to get backed up as a challenge (whereby, taking too long on a job starts losing value per hour on that job and could cost you money - and budgeting / scheduling is a real thing!!). This simulation should also estimate costs including the amount of fluids per job to know if you're pricing the job right. Mechanics is fun - but far more than just fixing a car. Anyway - if you like any of these ideas - comment on this and tell the programmers so we get their attention as I would LOVE to see this game taken to the next level... it's already so good and I can't wait to see what comes next.",1692721494,1692721494,True,0,0,0.464088410139083862,0,True,False,False

I had fun taking story orders and tinkering with the extra jobs that would come along. I was already pretty experienced with cars and their workings before, but this game definitely taught me a few things. I then bought my first classic car in the game and fixed it up, painstaking process overall with money and tediously going through everything but that's what it's really like. There's a few things I haven't really enjoyed about this game though, and some of them really annoy me.

Things I disliked:

The game feels very.. empty in some aspects. You build a car, it finally runs and you test it out.. but after you're kind of left wondering ""now what?"" You either do the same thing over with it which is go to the track or sell it for profit and start another one.

The interior designing is strongly lacking, I was expecting loads of customization options but all you can really do is add different seats or a steering wheel. You can't change bench seat colours and you can't colourize the dashboard or carpetting. (disregard if you can, but if it's possible I haven't figured it out yet.) Paint and bodywork is beautiful and satisfying.

The driving mechanics and overall feel of the cars is very boring. Starting it up for the first time is very underwhelming, the sounds aren't the best, and you can't really do anything in the car. It'd be cool if it had more of a ""My Summer Car"" feel where you have to adjust things and manually operate the handbrake, use the radio etc. Driving is a massive bummer in this game.

Inaccuracy with classic cars. I know that making interchangeable parts for each individual car would be very time consuming and unnecessary from a gameplay standpoint but it doesn't make any sense how a car from 1954 has an electric fuel pump in the tank along with a modern fusebox. 

The entire motor being unable to turn over due to A MISSING CLIP. First motor rebuild I did I forgot to place one little clip on the distributor and the car just simply wouldn't start as a whole. I had to look up the problem to figure this out because everything else was perfect.

Not really any interactive aspects that let you tune up the car such as adjusting the timing of your distributor or tuning the carburetor. You just kind of slap it together and if all the parts are good it just works. This is a really significant downfall to me in a game about car repair and restoration.

Other than that, I found this game to be quite entertaining. I enjoyed tinkering with the cars coming in and out of the shop, figuring out their problems and solving them. It can be pretty educational at times too, great way to learn more about the fundamentals of a car and what makes it tick. Don't let my review spook you from buying this, I genuinely enjoyed it and found it very entertaining, just lacking in aspects that you'd expect more from in a game focused on cars. I feel that if this game mashed together with My Summer Car, it'd be one of the best games out there. All I can say is try it for yourself, I genuinely enjoy this game but it just has small little things I don't like.

A major point of this game it seems to me is to be able to see ALL your cars. NOT just one at a time. (and that is terribly slow)  Version 2018 did a much better job at that. What is needed is a warehouse like structure to admire and wander around looking at all your cars, much like Jay Leno's setup. Also multiple engine stands would be great to display cool engines. These two ideas alone would make a great DLC and I for one would buy it immediately ! Does anyone else think this is a great idea?

I enjoy playing this game, but there are some serious accessibility issues.

Key rebinding is not properly supported. For example, you can't remind mouse click actions. And the game requires you to HOLD left mouse button A LOT. My right hand hurts after playing this game for a while.

Plus there is no keybinding support for controllers AT ALL.

Another issue I found playing this game is that the game is too bright but there is NO brightness setting in game. My eyes were hurting before I realized what the problem was. I had to use AMD settings to turn down brightness for this game.

I love the game itself but it is the first game in a very long time that makes me physically uncomfortable to play. (And I've been playing a lot of games, almost every evening.)

It's 2023 (well the game was made two years ago) and I don't understand why a game would be shipped without these rather standard settings.

There are also some QoL problems. You have to remember a lot of information and sometimes it takes many clicks to switch between screens in order to do something while needing to remember what you specifically wanted to do. I guess you could argue this is a simulation game but once you do it a hundred times you'd wish the game makes it easier to do those things.

Oh another things - you can't change settings unless you are in the garage. If you are on the race track or junkyard and you want to change settings - no you can't until you return to the garage.

I've noticed that when shopping for body parts, the vehicle is pictured in the menu.  That's a nice touch :-)  

Electronics/ignition parts are a totally separate menu when buying parts.  Interesting.

Things that need improvement:  The ability to inspect single parts.  Seems you can inspect a system as a whole, and get ONE look at what the parts condition is.  No way to go back and look again if you missed it. 

Also, I could swear that brake rotors and/or tires were more circular in CMS 2018.  Seems they have more defined edges this time.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I still can't change the review to positive on this game.  The DLC pool has more ""remastered"" DLC that new content.  This just shows how lazy the Devs have become.  With no true competition they just do what they want and people keep buying it.  The only thing that makes the game somewhat enjoyable is what the mods add.  To get the best mods you need to use a 3rd party launcher because like mentioned in my original review (below this update) the devs change the game structure to try and make mods more difficult to make much needed game play mods.




I wanted so badly to like this game.  I've tried to play it and I just can't get into.  Honestly there just isn't enough difference compared to the 2018 game.  Sure the new stuff is nice and the game looks good but its just more of the same overall.  Honestly I would have been happy if they would have just added the new stuff to the 2018 game as a paid DLC.  If you take the time to break down the new stuff most of it had similar mechanics in 2018.  All of the fluids act like oil.  The brake disc tool is a redressed balancer.

Car Mechanic Simulator 21 is a simulator that I have to say is still far from the real work of a car mechanic.  But since it is a game, it can somehow imitate the work.  Although in a very simplified and accelerated mode, but still... Thanks to this game, you can still learn something about this work (Names of parts, get a basic idea of ​​what is where and what all the cars have in them, and much, much more...).  But now to the simulator.  The simulator as such is interesting and if you are at least a little interested in the topic of cars, I think you won't be bored.  And even if you don't know what or how, the game is made so that even a person who doesn't know it can play it and have at least a little fun, and so from the beginning everything that needs to be changed is usually written and you can highlight it by pressing it to see where  It is.  The simulator starts with a tutorial that teaches you the basics such as changing the filters, changing the brakes, and this way you will gradually learn new and new things and how to repair/replace them. Later, when you are more experienced, it will no longer be a problem to replace the entire engine part by part or to replace the entire chassis. You can change almost anything in the game. From the engine to the body parts. The game has a system of improvements for points (quite similar to that in CMS 18), so the more you do on jobs, the more points you will have that you can spend on improving some ability (speed of tightening, speed of disassembly) but most importantly, you can open garage improvements  and add other assets such as a paint shop, a diagnostic track... Of course, this game is not all about completing tasks and being locked in a plot.  Maybe it looks like that at the beginning, but later when there is some money and some level, new places where you can do something will gradually open up (junkyard, auction network, speedway...) All these places are good for something.  At a junkyard, for example, you can get a car that can be yours quite cheaply, but the problem is that it is in a disastrous condition and it takes a lot of work and money to fix it.  But after renovation, these cars are usually sold with quite a large profit.  It depends on the type of car, etc... And if you have already made such a car, you can drive it to the speedway.  Or take the customer's car if it's driving and have it tested on the test track... It's up to you.  For those who bought the Drag dlc, they can even take their cars to drag races.

What i see negative in this game? The game receives a lot of paid dlcs, half of which are only remasters of old dlcs from CMS 18. Calculate the total amount for all dlcs, including Drag dlc and the latest tripledlc, so the amount is very high only for dlc for a game that will still get a sequel in a few years and the same thing again.

I hope I wrote the most important thing and that I helped someone.  I'm sorry for mistakes.  I'm writing this through a translator.  Bye!",1690336786,1690336786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, DO NOT get this game to learn how to repair your car. I was really hoping to be able to learn how to do an oil change on the 2014 Corolla, but there's a bunch of problems the developers need to solve before it becomes useful in that way.

1) There is no Toyota Corolla in the game. The game sometimes uses aliases for some manufacturers (presumably a legal issue), and there are a few Toyota-copy cars apparently,  but not a Corolla. There's dozens of old muscle cars in this game, but the modern selection is severely lacking.

2) There is no way you can just...pick a car and work on it, I think. You have to encounter them in the course of the game, and then if you want to progress through the game, you have to get rid of the car. There may be some workaround to this by...going to auctions? Finding them in barns? Something; it's not intuitive or easily accessed.

2.5) The auto-shop the player works in has a big mechanical jack in it. Want to learn where your car's jack goes, and where to place the blocks? You're out of luck.

3) The procedure for changing oil on a car is to get a big ol' thingy and move it under your car and press a button. I do not own this thing, and it seems like it is one of those things that only real mechanics have. My dad, on the other hand, has a pump, a hose, and a series of bottles he uses to change his oil. I'd like to learn and practice that.

There are some other process issues. While clicking and holding is okay for unscrewing a part, I once removed a bumper by clicking on it. I don't think removing a bumper is quite that simple. These oversimplifications may make the game smoother, but at the expense of the educational value of the game.

Finally...why am I forced to work in this junk environment? It's probably realistic for a mechanic that's just starting out, but again, if you want to learn how to work on your car, doing so in a grimy setting seems real unnecessary -- especially when the tutorial has a nice, clean space where you can see everything.

So, all in all, a well-made game for what it wants to be; that may not be what you want it to be, though, and lacks the features that would make the game really useful.",1688952313,1688952313,False,0,2,0.325510203838348389,0,True,False,False

there are a lot of really nice improvements to CMS 2021: the graphics and location design are much better than 2018's build, the addition of various new elements (fuse boxes, ECUs, fluid resevoirs) and everyday mechanic work (changing fluids) is nice, the new garage additions feel fitting and fun to mess with (car wash, brake lathe, outdoors areas, etc.) and the new auction house is a lot easier to use and somewhat more immersive than before.

but for the degree of grinding in both games (i have ~250 hours in CMS2018) to get upgrades, levels, new environments and the like, i feel there just isn't enough to work towards as a previous player of CMS2018. maybe if the controls were better optimized (i.e. middle mouse click & drag to orbit the camera instead of WASD), the UI was modernized, the grind reduced by maybe 10-15%, and maybe some more immersive mechanics (full 3d body repair, i.e. sanding, filling, repainting in full / wiring & dashboard deconstruction / even something simple like Power Wash Sim-style car washing, walking around and washing each part of the car using hitscanning) with something more than just a price tag and a cutscene. changes like that means a previous player like myself would get a bit more out of it.

again, if you've never played CMS, pick this up!! it's definitely the peak of the series as is, and with 2024/25 on the horizon, i'm excited for what devs have in store. but as a player who has been invested for 6 years, i just don't see enough of a jump between 2018 and 2021. take some extra time, maybe have a 4 or 5 year schedule, and use that time to advance each entry significantly past the previous ones. 

still love the series though. keep up the solid work, red dot!",1688846380,1688846380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts off tricky if you don't know the order of operations for the parts and what needs to be removed before what etc. But after I got enough money to rebuild an entire car part by part I was hooked. Then I went for 100% achievements. I thought rebuilding and selling 50 cars would be the toughest but it was actually hitting level 50. I finished all the quests and things that granted fast XP by level and since I was on easy, the last 10 levels were a grind.

- detailed assembling and disassembling 
- there are at least 2000 unique parts for each part of a car, e.g. spark plug, rod cap, fuel rails, etc.
- there are like 50 different cars that you can choose from and renovate 
- you can repair components
- you can race your car when its finished
- you can test your car with the test track and the dyno
- plenty more features

whats bad about this game
- some (only a few) things are tedious and take a very long time, such as upgrading components to be 3 stars with 100 components or more, which can take roughly an hour with 1000 components, since I have like 15000 components (sandbox) this can obviously take a huge amount of time
- some processes are very simplified, such as welding your car to repair the body. all you do is click on  the welder, move it and then click ok and the game does the rest, which is nice from a time efficiency point of view but its not very satisfying, unless you have a lot of rust on your car which is pretty satisfying. same applies to the car wash feature and the paintshop

There are no explanations of the different parts of the car and their functions (or why you need to ""balance"" tire and what it is). I was here to learn and just got dropped there with unclear objectives and partial ways to complete them.

For example, on the first order you need to repair the ""fuel pump"". I spent 30 min to find none. I found the ""fuel filter"" which is just dangling in the air, this piece is not connected to anything. I haven't found a fuel tank either, which I thought could lead to the fuel pump. I went around the car, but didnt find any entry to put fuel into the car. Guess the game doesnt go into that kind of details... 
I started dismantling the whole engine but the more I removed the less I saw this pump and the less I wanted to put it back together if by miracle it was in the depth of the machine. So I asked for a refund.
I finally asked Youtube to enlighten me and a video in german showed me where the fuel pump (and tank) was hiding. Not fun.

I guess it s good for people who already are into mechanics (seeing the good reviews) and can skip the dummies' steps, but for beginners it s just not possible to complete the first order with so few pointers and explanations. 

If it s easier and less frustrating to find the solution on Youtube, I dont see the point in playing the game.",1688414240,1688414240,False,0,1,0.451127827167510986,0,True,False,False

This one however is TOO BIG OF A GRIND. Every car has a ton of issues and most of the time is spent taking stuff a part and trying to find broken stuff. As a mechanic I can say this is not how things work. We listen for noises and get an idea of where the noise is and then isolate it that way. If I didn't do this I would spend all day on one car and make no money. 

Also almost every car requires you to drain and refill all the fluids. This again is not how things work. There is service life for fluids (except washer fluid). But in this game almost every car needs their brake fluid, power steering fluid, and coolant changed... Not to mention the stupid washer fluid requiring a drain and then fill. 

Also add an option like in Tank Mechanic Sim to add all missing parts to the cart

I feel like their is a lack of content so they just made all the story cars a PITA to extend the game play. I'm guessing all of the positive reviews are from those who like pointless grinds and have no mechanical experience.

My biggest regret was trying to give this game a fair chance after buying most of the DLC and wanting to like it and going out of the return window.",1688244939,1688244939,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeah it is cool to see an actual Ford or Dodge but it is very limited to the Engines and Car Models already in the base game with just different names. The engines all go together and come apart the same and that is not accurate nor creative. When I get done building a car from the latest DLC I feel as if I just paid for literal badges as nothing was different aside that. Sorry for the Rant but Greedy micro transactions seem to ruin any game I once enjoyed. The developers focus turns away from the base game and content and shifts to making easy money with cosmetics. Its absolutely ridiculous people buy into this scam over and over. Want to go trucking? Buy each state. Want to be a mechanic? Buy each brand. Imagine if Mario had charged by the level?

But it was a bit disheartening as someone with an automotive background to see how watered down some parts of it can be. It would be really cool to see more component models added so every car doesn't share the same handful of drivetrains, or that certain cars didn't have blatantly incorrect suspension setups, etc. 

Honestly a hardcore mode or something that really expands on the automotive experience would be really fun. After a while it sort of just turns into a repetetive ""point and click"" as youre doing pretty much the same process across all vehicles.

Please get this into your heads, that the FOV is way too low for many people!

I either just get them running or fully restore them. I get the most satisfaction out of restoring complete junk to or near their former glory. I mostly avoid the the car show room, except for getting achievements. what's the point?
Now, as for actually restoring the cars, there is some issues.  All the operations involved in a vehicle are absent; electronics, vacuum, air intake, exhaust, fluid delivery are all only represented by various parts.  The actual operation of said part, where and how it's connected,  is only assumed. You're supposed to know this already, I guess. Some parts aren't even connected to their counterpart. There's no hoses, no wiring harness, cables, just the assumption that they work (somehow). I guess the brake master cylinder works via bluetooth, connected to the 4 wheels.  

Some other peeves  about this game are lack of engine animation, your shop is dirty as hell, but thankfully we learned how to clean, finally. Customers? Shop employees? No, no other NPC's in which to interact . I should have my own show room, in place of the current rent a space storage.

I was new to everything car related and wanted to get a better understanding so that I can eventually start a project of my own, and was skeptical about whether this game would be accurate to the real thing, but after trying the demo I decided to buy it.

After playing the game for just 10 hours I could already pop the hood of my own car and point out pretty much everything and tell you what it was. Using the knowledge I used from this game alone I have already begun working on cars and hope to get an apprenticeship to become a mechanic in the future.

As an ardent fan of the franchise, I approached this installment with equal parts skepticism and excitement. And I am pleased to report that it did not disappoint! Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 has proven itself as a true successor to its predecessors, earning a solid four stars from this humble tech-priest.

First and foremost, the game's attention to detail is nothing short of commendable. From the engine bays to the interiors, every nook and cranny of the vehicles is meticulously recreated, allowing aspiring mechanics like myself to indulge in the intricacies of automotive engineering. The extensive range of car models available to tinker with is truly impressive, offering a delightful assortment of challenges for those seeking to test their mechanical prowess.

The gameplay mechanics of Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 are a testament to the developers' dedication. The intuitive interface and user-friendly controls make navigating through the various repair tasks a breeze. The addition of a comprehensive tutorial system ensures that even novices can gradually become adept grease monkeys, learning the ropes of the trade while enjoying the process. The satisfaction derived from troubleshooting and fixing complex issues is a unique thrill that the game captures flawlessly.

One aspect that truly sets Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 apart is its emphasis on authenticity. The game replicates the day-to-day challenges faced by real-world mechanics, incorporating a wide array of tools and equipment that accurately mirror those found in professional workshops. The inclusion of licensed parts and brand collaborations further enhances the immersion, creating an experience that is as close to reality as one can get without the grease-stained hands.

However, like any finely tuned machine, Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is not without a few occasional hiccups. While the game generally runs smoothly, there are instances of minor bugs and glitches that can momentarily interrupt the immersive experience. Additionally, the limited multiplayer options (Almost none) may leave some longing for more collaborative mechanics-based adventures. Nevertheless, these shortcomings are overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance.",1685557819,1687154100,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

If you had the same love-hate relationship I did with CMS 2018, it was probably for the annoying method of shopping for parts and storing inventory.

I'm glad to say that the devs have remedied this by making the shopping list infinitely better to use eliminating the need to store way more parts than the game is optimised for.

The mod support is terrific and the drag racing DLC really added a whole new level of engagement and motivation for tuning vehicles.

I do wish there was native wheel support - that seems like a hell of an omission. Pair that with some auto cross or casual race events and you'd have yourself an incredible game - would be a great idea for a DLC but maybe that's something we can look forward to in the next iteration along with some more involved wiring, vacuum lines and all the other clearly non-existent components in cars in this  universe

Amazing. Addicting. Fun. 

2 criticisms (Still a 5-Star game)...

First, the game doesn't include or mention anything about the difficulty of actually timing an engine you have just built. You don't just throw everything in the engine and then the car starts. Every step in the assembly process requires lining up dots and making sure different timing markers are in the right location/degree. Not a big deal but the game just acts like you throw the parts into an engine however you want and then the engine just starts. Timing engines is an art and is one of the most difficult parts of engine building/swapping.

Second, no torque wrenches or regard for the fact that different bolts can require vastly different torque numbers. I don't know. Maybe it'd be annoying to have to add a step and have to set a torque wrench for every type of bolt, but I just think they could have included it SOMEHOW. Even a quick animation showing a torque wrench or something. Idk. Just a thought. You don't just use an impact tighten things arbitrarily in cars. Some people do and then the next time something needs to be worked on, it breaks the part or the bolt is stripped. Torque values exist for a REASON.

All in all, still a 5-Star game. I love this game. I love the auction system. I love the freedom to make money however the hell you want in whatever way you're clever enough to think of. Realism is obviously very good 9/10. Just a couple missed opportunities (in my personal opinion).",1686182044,1686182044,True,73,0,0.854105472564697266,0,True,False,False

Been playing on my Lenovo Legion Y720 and it plays a little laggy, but it's still playable. I am looking forward to hopefully getting a Steam Deck so I can take this on the go. I highly recommend this game if you like relaxing simulation games.

I know next to nothing about cars, but this game has been a breath of fresh air to play. I completed it on the PS5 (got all trophies) but I still play it. The console versions don't have mods but so far some of the mods for the PC have had issues that haven't been addressed, like missing exhaust pipes and other issues, but they are very fun to find and strip down and put back together again.

Just a little suggestion if you buy the game. Use a controller. Using the mouse and keyboard is a horrible experience, at least for me. Since I play games mainly on my PS5, I suppose using the mouse and keyboard is just not intuitive for me.

If there are future versions of this game I would like to see more depth added to some areas. 
For Example
-Suspension (Strut/spring/coilovers/bags)
-Wheels (Spacers, camber, fitment)
-Electronics (Expand on multimeter use, don't make it automatic, don't make fault components so easy to find)
-Fluids (Don't allow turkey baster for all fluids, drain coolant like oil, don't ranger method brake fluid, add brake bleeding ,  and remove window washer fluid requirements (so dumb))
-Seized hardware (Don't make wd40 work every time. add more frustrating ways to fix stripped nuts and bolts)

Took me like 5 days.
The game has great detail in parts and a lot of them and the graphics are absolutely fine for that.
Some things are a bit simplified of course, as you don't want to click 1 million times for assembling a car.
But it's fun and addictive and you actually learn a thing or two about cars.
You won't be able to build one yourself, but at least know where and what the important stuff is.
Even after I reached the state, where I had money to burn, I still continued enjoying just repairing and tuning cars.
It's rewarding and also very chill.
My hand gets destroyed from all that mouse clicking when I play hours and hours per day,
so I actually play with controller now. That works much better for me and prevents carpal tunnel.

The game has some usability issues which never got resolved.
Like, the shopping of missing parts is not really streamlined. It's a lot of clicking.
The shopping list is not that flexible and the controls for it clash with the shop controls.
If you are not cautious, you accidetnally delete something from the list
when you actually just wanted to go back to shop overview.

Another minus is: The minigames for certain actions like scrapping or repairing is completely
non-related to the games mechanics. They are just a little skill game.
And upgrading parts is generally a tedious waste of time (in an already tedious game).

You will inevitably make mistakes during assebly and if you are as dumb as me,
you will have to disasseble a V8 motor down to it's motor block again, when you are not paying attention,
because you forgot to insert ONE new piston ring and didn't reach the necessary condition threshold because of it.
But you will learn through pain...
And some error messages due to missing parts, wrong parts, or incomplete engines,
or engines that won't start are too generic.
You have no idea as a new player what you need to do to fix it or why a damper would not want to
go in there.
Telling me, that a motor is ""not complete"" after re-assembling it for 30 minutes is not exactly helpful.
Although, after you figure these things out, it's manageable.
(I just say: Check those d*mn clips on your ignition distributor and the ones on your air filter case...)
So overall, I'm a bit late to the party with this game, but I already got it's moneys worth out of it.
The DLCs are mostly recommended, except maybe for the Drag Racing DLC, which is overpriced for what is does.
I got all, except the Hot Rod (no interest in those) and the Drag Race one.
But play the demo, before you decide to buy DLCs.

This is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review whether its early access or full release, now onto the review.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is a game all about fixing vehicles up. You can do jobs on AI vehicles or go to the junkyard & the auction to buy vehicles, fix them up & sell them. 

Vehicles: the vehicles in this game are awesome. The vanilla cars are from real cars but are not called their real names due to copyright issue but it doesn't hurt the game at all. The dlc vehicles are based on real cars with I think their real names as well. As I said these vehicles look amazing. 

Fixing: the base of the game is fixing the vehicles up for money & experience points. You can disassemble the vehicles & can ether fix the parts at workbenches or buy new. Some parts can be fixed & some have to be bought new. The only issue I encounter is some parts that can be fixed sometimes doesn't at the workbench. It feels like there is a limit to how many times you can repair parts before you have to buy new parts. 

Buying & Selling: you can sell old/new parts at any point. This also applies to the vehicles you buy, you can sell the vehicle at any point whether its at 10% fixed or 99% fixed. You can everything new except the cars. You can only buy new cars at the dealership but only have like 3 or 4 to buy.

Leveling UP: when leveling up in the game you can get a bigger garage, more lifts, more tools, cheaper prices & faster dissembling. Only issue is you continue to level up even after unlocking everything & nothing to spend the extra point on.

Coolest Feature: the coolest feature I like in the game is the shopping list system. In the previous game you couldn't add parts to a list to keep track but in this game you can add parts to buy to a list, go to the shop & click the part you cant to buy & i will pull up the part. 

Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is by far the best of the series & I hope we can get a CMS game where we work on old vintage cars from the past or even a game where its futuristic cars. Ether way CMS 2021 is a solid 9/10 score & i highly recommend you pick this game along with the previous versions as well.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to watch him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

With Power Wash Simulator becoming one of the best zen-like time sinks I've ever played in my life (when it's out of Early Access I will do a full review) and my past addiction to time management games like Diner Dash I can easily play this game for hours on end with tunes in the background cranking out cars. There's not really a story here, obviously, but you start out from scratch with the most basic tools and a small garage, but over time you can expand, make repairing faster, and fix up cars from the ground up even.

You start out with just the basics. One lift, slow examination, mounting, and screwing skills. You start with the first of 30 story repairs by doing tire changes, fluid flushes, and basic repairs. The great thing about CMS is slowly getting you familiar with how cars work and break down. I felt like the game was rocket science at first and quickly got frustrated. What's a rubber bushing?! Where are they all?! Then I realized that all the bushings are tied to the suspension. You eventually learn each section of every car and will start building engines from the ground up and then entire cars. After about three or four hours I was expanding my garage by adding car washes, another lift, spending XP to make my skills faster, and adding things like a welder to get rid of rust on bodies.

Things get easier and faster once you unlock diagnostic tools like an OBD scanner, multimeter, and fuel and engine pressure tests. In the beginning, you basically have to take everything apart and look for the completely rusted parts as those are the ones needing replacement. The beginning cars will tell you what's wrong so you get the hang of how the gameplay loop works. Later on, every part will be undiscovered and it's up to you to diagnose, visually examine (it's an actual diagnostic mode), and know-how to spot fully worn parts. Sometimes you can take a car on a test track to get a wider diagnosis of what's wrong, then there's the test path for brakes and suspension. Eventually, you'll get the hang of what diagnostics work for each condition of a car. If the car won't start then you should use your examination mode first, then your OBD scanner and multimeter and fix those parts. If the engine fires up but won't drive then you need to do the other tests. Sometimes non of the tests will tell you what's wrong and you have to do exploration diagnostics.

There are other elements like a spring puller for shocks, tire separator, and balancer, a brake disc lathe, and you can do a small minigame to repair parts that aren't completely destroyed, of course, once you unlock all these tools. You can even do headlamp adjustments and alignments. It's fun changing fluids, screwing in parts, and discovering new engine types with more pieces than before, but after you finish the story all that's left are random repairs (which are quicker than story missions) and visiting the junkyard and auction to rebuild cars and sell them for more money to turn around and buy more cars, but what's the appeal in that? Driving the cars on the track is really generic and boring, and the fun part of the game is the mechanic part. I don't want to collect cars really. Once I upgraded and bought all the expansions there wasn't anything left to do.

After about 20 hours I could build any car with my eyes closed, and this is my main concern with CMS. The individual car systems are limited in scope. Yes, there are many engine types, but they all go together basically the same just with different parts and varying sizes. It was fun to build an engine on the stand and lower it into the car. I had fun restoring several cars and repainting them or giving the car performance parts to stick on the dyno. However, if it's not for a repair I didn't feel any satisfaction. Once you rebuild a few cars you experience the most challenging part of the game. There were a few issues early on in which you can get stuck with no money if you start buying up too much. You need to grind repairs until you get around 30,000 credits and can rebuild and sell a simple car from the junkyard to give you your first serious payment.

The other issue is that everything is canned. All animations and movements and actions. This isn't Surgeon Simulator or Cooking simulator. There are no hands you control in real-time. When you click apart there's an outline of where it needs to go. You hold the mouse button down and the part appears and so do the screws. You hold the mouse down on all the screws and you move on to the next part. It's essentially like building Legos. The overall longevity outside of the story missions will determine how much you get out of these limited systems within the cars and various small mini-games. It becomes redundant and almost boring after so long when the entire reaches its peak early on.

What's here is a satisfying and fun simulator for at least 20-30 hours. You will want to grind the story missions, unlock everything, and experience everything at least once. Restoring cars from just the frame is fun, but I also would have liked more exterior customization. It's very limited to just doors, windows, hood, trunk, lights, mirrors, and that's it. There's also almost no satisfaction from just buying cars, restoring them, and keeping them to race on a dull track, or selling them for money that isn't really needed anymore once you unlock everything.",1684065134,1684065134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

well there a lot of pros and cons to this game but im just going to say if you like building cars or liked cms2018 then this is your game i like the mini games it takes rng out of the repair tables so that a pro. the only con i will say that i hate is the lack of how many cars you can find in the junkyard but that can be fixed so it a con that the devs or the player if they know how to mod game files for each car to add them to the junkyard or the barns but it does not increase you chance of finding them there. if you what to know if this game is good 16.4 of the 61.7 hours i have in game at the time i wrote this i got on launch so it good it's 1000% better then a call of duty title in how the devs hear us the community out and try to do the best they can do to do it i mean as someone who reported bugs in cms2018 at launch i have gotten to level 41 in cms2021 and have not seen a major bug so yea i recommend this game 100% also don't listen to the crazy's that say cms2021 is a carbon copy of cms2018 they are wrong that are mostly haters or want this game to be a free dlc upgrade to cms2018 that runs on a different version of the unity game engine so it would never work",1629035264,1683851276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a little more complex than it was in 2018, but it makes it so you actually have a bearing on how well something is repaired.  This game is a fun and simple time sink for those of us that just want to click things and 'vedge out'.  It's not a simulator. It's not going to teach you how to repair your car. It's just good mindless fun.
I haven't figure out everything yet, like i started the scrapping stuff but haven't gone back to it.  I like the upgrades and customization you can do to your garage space.
I have done any driving either, because I just didn't care for it back in 2018, I haven't bothered.
Really the only thing I don't like, so far, if I had to nitpick, would be the shopping list and store stuff.  I feel like it is not very intuitive and a bit clunky.  I do like that you can search fro parts right from your shopping list, but I'd like to have a way to check off the items I got without removing them from the list, as well as adjust the number of the item I need.  I'd also like the shop to set the sizes of stuff like tires and rims for me if I buy the item by search from the shopping list, or at least give me a spot where I can make a note of the size I need so I have it on the purchase screen.

These cars can even be driven around town or taken to the local race track to test their high end performance with very realistic emulation for how the vehicles would perform in the real world.

Driving the vehicles most certainly takes a back seat to the process of taking the vehicles apart, repairing what can be repaired, replacing what cannot, then reassembling the vehicle to its factory glory or even tuning it to be a superior version of its original design. While the vehicles in the base game are all fictitious (generally based on a real world car, or a mash-up of multiple real world vehicles), the parts you'll interact with in game are representative of the parts used in real world vehicles and will help the player come to an intermediate-to-advanced understanding of the inner workings of their vehicle.

It is this familiarity with vehicle mechanics that in my opinion elevates this game to higher education level of value. Unquestionably I will have my children play this (or the latest version of this game) when they are becoming old enough to drive. I can think of few more effective ways to help them understand the 2-ton death machines they'll be operating. Perhaps they'll even develop a love for the processes they learn in game and dedicate themselves to the craft. Even if they don't choose to be a mechanic, the game will offer them practice in operating a business with substantial initial investments before becoming profitable.

As a professional car technician for years, this really insults me.
It's not realistic at all.  Couple of examples:
- Head gaskets doesn't exist in this game. Neither do head bolts.
- All cars use the same brake pads, and all cars have disc brakes.
- Toothed timing belts doesn't have teeth.
- Engine hoses and wiring doesn't exist in this game.
- Changing fluids by sucking it out with a pump? That's called a scam.
- Parts can't be accessed from the underside and vice versa when they clearly can.
- Parts are bolted on with unrealistic oversized bolts, and with too few bolts. (i.e: power steering pump has one bolt)
- Car lift has only two positions; bottom or fully up. And not the recommended half position.
- Compression test can't be done if the engine doesn't start.
- Bolts inside the engine are rusted and can be loosened with some WD40.
- Pricing of parts doesn't make any sense. 
- You have to pay a fee if you spill oil on the floor instead of just cleaning it up.
- And a lot more stuff like this.

After playing this game for some hours, I found it to be boring, mundane and annoying to play because of all the small incorrections and monotonous nature of the game.
If you're a car mechanic, I highly recommend you to play something else. This is just annoying and cringe.

It would be more interesting if there were more garages or if there was more place to place cars in garage so you could more at the same time and more place to make more than a 1 engine

Achievements are soo boring and take soo long to make even tho after 30 hours i own everything and the only thing i can do is upgrade cars with painted engines.

And if there was an option after taking an item to note that there would show it in a normal store  and the other one*.

Being able to fit any engine into any cars would be nice too

Positives
-Lots of cars to work on
-Close to realistic mechanics
-premium parts for cars for higher end tuning
=lots of rim and tire choices

negatives
-light glare on engines and parts from 'sun light' above .  Would like the 'glare' or 'brightness' controls.
-game freezes randomly (having to save multiple times because when game freezes, have to restart game and all progress is lost).  This is the ONLY game that I have random freezing issues with.

I really love this game. The detail on the models is great, the graphics are alright, the gameplay is fun... It's a good game. However I have some major complaints:

1. Lack of engine options - some cars only have one or two engine options, I want more.

2. Horrible engine sounds - the engine sounds in the game are absolutely atrocious and are the same three reused for every engine. When I spend hours refurbishing a car, and decking out the engine, I want to hear the fruits of my labor, not some CopyRightFreeEngineSound.mp3 garbage.

3. Awful vehicle physics/handling - I understand the focus of this game is not the driving, but the driving mechanics feel like they belong in a mobile game, a little more effort would be great.

4. No steering wheel support.

5. The DLCs are often very bare bones and don't do much that a mod can't.

6. A lot more that I am forgetting right now.

Basically, it's a great game, if you love cars, it's worth it. However, there are a *lot* of problems. Your decision.",1681361515,1681361571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Educational value is basic. You will learn basic parts of cars and how they go together, but you will not learn how a combustion engine actually works. Or gearbox, Or turbo, or etc. The parts available are also quite simplified which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good thing is it keeps the game easy to approach but on the flip side once you are comfortable with it you kind want a bit more detail. In that regard 2021 is a small step forward from previous version as it adds a few things basic liquids and more electrical components. No wires or hoses which I would personally really like to see. Visually the game looks decent enough but will not win any realism awards. Broken parts are just rusty, there is no other indicator or different ways to break. ""Fixing"" things or doing assembly tasks are done via simple mini-games which is ok I guess but also could use little bit more complexity. Scrapping/repairing in particular are just endless clickety-click. You do that a lot though, so it needs to be very fast to do which is a tough equation to crack...fast task that isn't brainless?

Memes aside, there are some really easy quality of life additions devs can do to make the game WAY less painful. Even without taking away from the ""realism"" they're going for. 

1. Uncap the limit on the amount of parts you can buy at once. A limit cap of 50 is too low. In total to get the Trader achievement you need to buy like, 900 Rubber Bushings. (Not exaggerating) When you can only buy 50 at a time, it's annoying. 
2. Make it so you can type in the number of items you need in the ""Buy"" menu, instead of having to click the tiny little arrow to scroll one number at a time. If you need exactly 18 bushings for a car, it would be nice to just click and type ""18"".
3. Make an option for the window tinting mechanism to ""Tint All Except Windshield"". Tinting every window black, then having to go back in and clear the windshield for more money doesn't make sense. Doing each window individually is annoying as well. 
4. This one kind of takes away from the realism aspect I guess. But when you add a tire to your shopping list, it would be amazing if the dimensions of the tire were attached with it. You could even make it a skill you have to unlock or something. You're finished unlocking stations and skills WAY before you hit level 50 anyway. You could easily add more. 

Overall: You will absolutely not learn anything you can use irl from this sim. Aside from maybe learning the names of parts in an engine. Simulators in general are pretty cozy. This one doesn't fail to deliver that. Solid sim.",1681015108,1681015108,True,1,0,0.512820541858673096,0,True,False,False

It also just looks better, too. Now, there are mods that basically double the features and improve on the rest, but so far I didn't feel bored enough to spice my game up that way.

I've seen all the videos to increase your Experience score, but no body mentions using your engine diagnostic tools on every single car... Hint.

Cons:
- Not as many really nice cars like in CM 2018
- Auctions take for ever it seems just hitting the space bar to bid for what seems 20 minutes.
- Setting up a 3 Star car build will cost you a hole lot of money and hours of you time,
- I don't like the mini games to repair and recycle... at all.

If you like to work on cars, learn part names, rebuild cars from bottom up and never bust a knuckle, this game may be for you. If you like to take a test run and fly into a guard rail causing NO damage and maybe even flip the car, this game is possibly for you. If you wanna mix and match for fun, again, you may like this game. I like to try whatever comes to mind sometimes.. Go strange or modern... I still am not very good at gearbox ratios. *sigh* and the tires required to handle the gearbox and power. That, I'm still learning. But I did learn I'm a bit tired of bearings and push rods. lol There's SOOO many!

(image added to review 12 July 2022) I finally got a Lamborghini Diablo. I may or may not change the headlights :D I kinda like the look of them being different.

Update (7 April 2023) This game is still awesome. I've enjoyed restoring the vehicles. When I play, I think of my little brother (passed away before last Christmas). He loved working on cars, too. :D He just had tougher knuckles than I do. lol And was a tiny bit stronger than me. Okay, he was way stronger. Anyhow, this game is still fun to come back to and work on a car or 2.  Once you get the hang of it, your thoughts will flow as you work on cars, if you are like me. You'll start to think of times that involve cars, or parts or something else you're experiencing in the game. :) I'm recently working on the Typhoon car. I'm not sure if it was in one of the DLC I bought. I do buy them. Especially when they are on sale. (Summer is coming!) You can sort your wish list by DISCOUNT. Very helpful when the DLC go on sale.

I'll never, ever, ever regret buying this, nor the 2018 version. Both are great :D

It is very complex with many different parts to pay attention to, remember, and customize.

For me personally, it was too much to remember, learn, and pay attention to. I work on my car irl since I autocross, and wanted to use this game to learn a bit more. It's not quite detailed enough for that, while having a pretty complicated menu system that could probably be more intuitive if things were interactive instead of using the multiple circle menus with no labeling what each icon means until you hover over it. Very steep learning curve. 
I do appreciate the attention to detail, how each car seems quite correct in most ways to its original model, down to the suspension parts. I can tell people who love cars made this game, so hats off to you. I simply don't have the attention span for it XD
And for those who like it, enjoy. It seems pretty darn impressive, but by the end of the tutorial, I was pretty bored and a tad confused at how much there was to remember.

There are elements like part yards and barns where you may or may not find a car you want to work on but other then the cars........you have no worldy idea why you would look thorugh piles of 100s of parts. They missed huge opportunities to incorporate immersive simulation aspects into the game and instead filled those parts with elementary mini games and automation.

Main one is that there isn't enough in-game cars. We need a whole library of cars (not just 72 and the DLC add onS) but more, ranging from the early 1900s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc to now. So thousands of different models otherwise it does get repetitive and quite boring.

Graphics: More Detailed
Textures and lighting are way better, rust maps and reflections have increased resolution. Makes looking at the parts and cars more pleasing and realistic.

Audio: Better
The core sounds like mounting and screwing are the same as 2018. The engine sounds are much more realistic compared to the whiny and screechy 2018 engines. The V10s and V12s now sound like engines instead of dying cats.

Gameplay: Similar
The gameplay loop is very close to CMS 2018. The orders come in and are completed the same way. More variety from the new vehicles and engines added to this version. New features include the ability to randomly determine a certain number of parts' damage in different sections of the vehicle (engine, rear center suspension, unsprung suspension), and move vehicles to other locations regardless of installed suspension and wheels, such as from a lift to the garage entrances to the paintshop, but they will sit on bricks.

Progression: More Expensive
The examination tools that you start with in 2018 now have to be bought, albeit for low prices. The garage expansions and workbenches have to be bought, and in the case of the paintshop, have different tiers that include new features. Skill points are only used to decrease the amount of time spent examining, removing, placing, and screwing parts, with each rank needing 1+ what you used on the last rank. There are six skills that can be upgraded, and the total skill points needed to unlock them all is 126, 21 per tree. Luckily, the number of points gained per level up increases by one at levels 4, 7, and 10.

Shop Layout: More Realistic
The area around the shop has been fleshed out and given an environment. The dyno has been given its own building, and the paint shop and test path have their own building as well. All of the workbenches and the warehouse have been moved into their own room in the main garage. Number of lifts has been reduced from 3 to 2 unfortunately. Two new additions include a salvage bench and a car wash. Moving between the buildings does not cause lag or loading screens.

Auction: Much Improved
The auction system is much better, where 2018 had 6 cars per visit and they had to be bidded on in order. 2021 lets you choose between complete cars for more money and salvage cars with varying levels of damage and missing parts for cheap. They can be chosen in whatever order you want and have more variety with more cars per visit. Your Steam friends are also included as other bidders at auctions instead of generated names.

Part Repair: More Tedious
You have to play a minigame for every part, and level of repair is based on how well you do in the minigame. Makes reusing parts a pain.

Paintshop: More Choice
Paints have different options for finishes and choices for factory colors with more upgrades. Number of decals have been increased.

New Features:

Salvaging: Aggravating
Every part is given a star rating based on the number of times it has been upgraded. This works similar to the quality system in 2018, where some parts found are better. Performance parts get a power boost from upgrading, and engines without 3 star performance parts can't make the same horsepower numbers as typical store bought 2018 parts. Upgrades require ridiculous amounts of scrap when salvaged parts give 1-2-3 scrap based on how well you did in the minigame for each part salvaged. Around $10,000-$12,000 worth of junkyard parts will yield around 1,000 scrap. Only worth making extremely high horsepower engines.

Carburetor and ECU Tuning: Take It or Leave It
The tuning system is based on whether you install performance carburetors or a performance ECU. The higher the stage on the ECU, the more options you have to boost your performance. Tuning is affected by moving individual bars or circles and managing the dip in power that changing one setting causes. +1 on one bar causes -1 on the other bars and vice versa in the range of -2 to +2. Partly skill, partly RNG. If you take the time to get the maximum percent, with a stage 3 ECU, you can get a +10% to your total horsepower, but a stage 3 ECU costs $10,000.

Overall: 4.4 of 5
A very meditative gameplay loop and all in all, a great improvement to CMS 2018.",1679973098,1679973098,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Really enjoyable, very simple even if you don't know cars you can probably still play this game because it can hold your hand if you let it such as highlighting a part that needs to be replaced from the order sheet. I really like how closely realistic the game is without it being a pain in the butt to actually understand and enjoy. It's relaxing unlike in real life where you spend thousands of dollars to fix a vehicle to just find out the head gasket and piston ring is cracked that caused the oil and coolant to mix (Personal experience). Yes it can be repetitive but that's literally how cars are in real life but at least it's not super in depth where theres a wiring harness lets just thank God for that because this game probably would have worse reviews and not having to gap the spark plugs correctly or us special lubricants on XYZ.. If you're on the fence try the demo, if the game is on sale get it soon as you can I did before even trying the demo and I really enjoy it I just hate how the DLC's only add a handful of vehicles but at least there is a Steam Workshop! This is also the latest Car Mechanic Simulator at this very point and probably be the last or I could be wrong. Edit: Also not every car is in this game, that would be cool but just imagine having to do design thousands of cars even ones that are rare like the Ford Model T, at least they have the more popular and favorites in this game plus some filler lemon cars.",1679970154,1679970410,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

There is so much more added in. Details and parts that were missing before are added in. The additional testing options in the test path and the new areas of the car (fuse boxes and fluids) make it even more fun. Another complaint I recall people having in the older games was that there were no stuck bolts, but they even finally added that in.One of the best features is the grind..some people may not like it but I prefer to play these games in the hardest difficulty setting and in the previous games, it was way too easy to make money. This game makes the grind a lot harder which makes upgrades like discounts at the shop, significantly more useful. Saving up to buy something important or to build a nice car is really a treat. You really get a sense of accomplishment when you complete a project.Cons: There are a few.-You can no longer enter examination mode and individually inspect a part. Instead you stand outside the car and select a group/region and it auto inspects the area. I find that annoying. It saves time I suppose but it is frustrating if you forget which specific part you were intending to replace.-As with the previous titles, the sound effects and UI noises are truly great but the car engine sounds are pretty bad. I don't mind so much though since I don't care for the driving. I have actual racing sims for that.-I also miss the 2018 style garage. The one in this game isn't as nice to look at and I don't enjoy the layout as much. Not a big deal but still a con to me.Overall, I respect this developer so much now after having played all through this series and watching it evolve.

With eight years of experience under my belt, I thought I had seen it all. But boy was I wrong! The cars that people bring in for repairs these days are straight out of a scrap yard. But that's where the fun starts!

One memorable experience was when Anna Power came in with her old jalopy. The car was in such bad shape that I wasn't sure if it would ever run again. But, as they say, where there's smoke, there's fire! So, I got to work, starting with the exterior cleaning. I'm talking a full-on scrub, polish, and wax! Then, it was time to tackle the engine. After replacing the busted parts and tuning it up, it purred like a kitten.

But the fun didn't stop there! Anna wanted the interior of the car to sparkle too, so I gave it a thorough cleaning. The amount of gunk that came out of the seats was unbelievable. But after a few hours of scrubbing and cleaning, the interior was as good as new!

Finally, it was time to hand the car back to Anna. She was thrilled with the job I had done, and even left me her phone number in case I ever wanted to grab a drink.

The game is very light on the internal parts of a car. Don't expect to work on blower motors, center consoles,  or dashboards. Body work seems like an afterthought. Fenders and bumpers just pop right off! There's no work to remove them, no bolts, no grommets, nothing. They just slide right off! There are no cowlings. Wipers are displayed, but can't be changed or worked on. Wiper motors, wiper arms, wiper wiring, none of them are there. Indeed, there are no hoses and wires. The economy is very simple, so it is fairly easy to make money.

On the plus side, I have enjoyed playing the game. Also, I have learned a lot about engines and suspensions. The normal and easy levels show hints and ""ghost"" parts, to allow for non-mechanics (like myself) to know where parts can and should go. This greatly reduces frustration. Even with that, the first few cars I worked on, I was wondering where things were. I needed to replace a camshaft, and I had no idea what a camshaft was. It took me a little bit to find it. Then people started asking for ""tune ups."" To me, that meant adjusting the engine to idle and run smoother. In the game, that means buying parts from the Tune-Up shop!

Some of the cars are the same
Engines are the same
Parts are the same
And basically the whole game is the same lmao

The new features ive noticed were:
WD-40 to spray bolts that are rusted on
Having to refill more of the reservoirs or containers (brake servo, coolant and so on)
You now can press the throttle when inside the car (auction, barn? and the garage)
Wheel and headlight alignment
Ability to wash cars
Ability to add items to your shopping list that you can open while browsing the shops

I still had plenty fun, though, I appreciate the large variety of different engine designs implemented in the game, and overall scope of repairs the player does to cars. Highly detailed 3D models make disassembly and reassembly an great exercise in technical curiosity.
However, that's pretty much all there is to do. After 20 hours I feel like I've seen almost everything the game has to offer, all I could do now is to optimize my workflow further and make bank.
I found the career mode difficult at times, because in-game money is sometimes tight, and story missions do not tell you in advance how much money you're going to need to complete them. This, combined with a single save file, means it's relatively easy to get completely stuck by mistake, and recovering requires grinding boring cookie-cutter generative side missions. Some gameplay elements are never explained, e.g. the purpose of upgrades, which makes for fun exploration, but ends up being confusing at times, and I needed to read guides to learn which upgrades I need to do a particular type of repair.
Story missions are kinda weird, where the storyline description often does not match the damage on the car, but you're not getting this game to read customer stories.
Overall a fun experience. And if you happen know all about how OHV and OHC engines differ in terms of which parts are susceptible to most wear, you should enjoy this game a lot.",1676199371,1676199371,True,14,0,0.691277444362640381,0,True,False,False

There are some improvements but also some problems. First, lets cover improvements. Graphics are a step up from 2018, and as well as this, the repairs are a lot more in depth, with the addition of fluids besides oil, and yet more parts to keep track of. For people who like mental puzzles in video games, this is perfect. Plus, its accurate for people who are into cars. However, I have several problems. First, the game doesn't run that great on low-end hardware. I have a decent gaming laptop, with an i5-9300h, GTX 1650, and 24GB ram, and I can only run it on medium settings at 50~ fps. Second off, if you choose not to purchase dlc, the car roster is still fictional, which can annoy hardcore car guys like myself. Finally, although I like the complexity, its definitely not for everyone. Overall, I recommend the game, but I'll admit its not for everyone, and I'd only truly recommend it for people willing to put up with some of these issues.

TLDR; At first it was fun, after 40 hours, next game. Worth the price.

NO, because its UI is gets to be the ""design pain"" that you get on real cars trying to reach that one part... the developers don't play their own game, otherwise they would understand the frustrations of having to :

Paint parts one-by-one-by-one... not having small parts stack (got 20 rubber bearings 2 pages in the inventory, which you cannot go from 1 to 20 without having to go through all the other pages. 

Somethings are right click others are left click, some get the command wheel others don't, some click on picture some click on button... ugh of course there are the keyboard commands that kind of help.

Some cars don't list the engine they take, just a picture of one of two engines... and it only takes one.

The mini games are kinda cool for the first 5 minutes, but when you got 100s of parts to scrap, you start to not care. Not to mention it will take 1000s of parts to get a 3 star engine, and parts give 1-3 (some 4 or 5), if you play the mini game. You will upgrade your parts to 3 star once and never do it again.

Some things you put together before hand, which is cool (shocks, tires), but others you have to click multiple times when installing... suspension arms, pistons, etc...

I played one character for 40 hours, only got to level 17ish... and am really annoyed with the speed a which you mount parts and screws, sure you can speed them up - but still gets very old very quick.

The car designs are not really that different, there are maybe 3 types.

If you are asking yourself if this game will teach you anything about mechanics? It will teach you the parts of an engine, like looking at a picture - otherwise not much else to learn about cars

So 50/50, if you are a car builder or like clicking and holding A Lot!

The developers don't seem to care about creating new content or about all the suggestions the community make. They only care about remaster dlc's and selling them again.

If you have even a passive interest in working on cars - even if you don't do it in real life - this will be a good simulator for you.

Now, time to dig into the details.

First of all, the overall premise is pretty simple: you're a mechanic. You have a garage. You work on cars. What type of work you do, or how you do it, is entirely up to you. Just work in your garage and have fun tearing apart cars and fixing them.

You start out as a standard mechanic, taking on orders from customers. They'll send in their car with all its problems - bad breaks, or poor shifting, or noisy acceleration, or whatever the case may be. Early on, you're cash-poor and inexperienced, so it takes you quite a while to unscrew the bolts, and every little bit of change helps. As you gain experience, you ""level up"" and can increase your skills on a skill tree, and your progression is up to you - you can upgrade your bolt screwing speed, get discounts from the shop, increase your ability to diagnose things, etc. As you gain cash you can buy expansions for your garage, from extra car lifts to portable diagnostics tools to even a dyno. Keep grinding those customer car jobs!

As you begin to get a little bit of cash built up, you can begin to expand your activities into other fields, such as buying old junkers to restore to new, or even buying high-end cars so you can tune the heck out of them to increase their performance to frankly almost unrealistic levels. You'll find yourself doing all kinds of activities car-fixing/tuning related.

There is a bit of a rinse-repeat element to this game. Although there is plenty of variety, it IS basically the same thing - tear cars apart and put them back together. For people who are into this kind of game, in no way does that ""rinse/repeat"" element get in the way of having fun. I logged I don't even know how many hours in 2018, and have already logged 42 hours in this iteration.

For fans of 2018, I CAN say that there is a WORLD of new cars, parts, engine layouts, and overall options. There were plenty of parts in 2018, for sure, but I can now scroll through just page after page of JUST RIMS, let alone other parts. There are so many different parts now that the devs actually split the standard car parts into two different stores - mechanical parts and electrical parts. (For example, the spark plugs and ignition coils can no longer be found in the same store as, say, Idle Roller B's.) That says nothing about the tuning parts store, the interior parts store, and all the rest. If you were a fan of how many parts were in 2018, you're going to be in heaven in 2021. (Also thank GOD for all the different engine layouts in 2021. I was beginning to know the layouts in 2018 like the back of my hand.)

This version crushes a few of the old annoyances from 2018, and completely misses other annoyances. It's an overall improvement, but I wish a few of the old ""ugh""'s had been solved.

One such example of a miss is that ""omg I put the rubber bushing in the wrong spot"" issue. If you've played 2018, you KNOW what I'm talking about. Let's say you're fixing a car and the owner wants at least 50% or better parts put in on the repair. You find out that this rubber bushing over here in spot X is at 48%, but it's not listed as one of the problems. This rubber bushing over HERE, though, in THIS SPOT (spot Y) is at 7% and is listed as one of the problems. You buy a brand new one. You forget where the problem was and forget to ""highlight"" it and install the brand new one in spot X, and the 48% one in spot Y.... and the overview states you have not fixed the problem. You know, because the brand new one was not put in EXACTLY THE RIGHT SPOT. So now you get to tear back down and put the exact same rubber bushings (48% and 100%) in different spots, which magically solves the issue. UUUUUGH. Yes, that is still a thing.

There are some things that are no longer ""a thing,"" however. You remember how in 2018, you would have a bad part that had not yet been identified, and you would tear the entire engine down searching for that ONE STINKING PART that just could NOT be found? ...And then you'd find out it was ""Clip B"" on the air filter cover? You just stripped the entire engine down to the engine block and Clip B was the ""problem""!? Yeah, I haven't seen that so far in 42 hours of gameplay. If ""Clip B"" (or some other such tiny issue) is a problem, it's going to be part of a larger problem - such as the air filter or something.

Another thing I LOVE... is the new ""list search"" feature. You old 2018 fellows know the pain of creating your shopping list and buying. Make sure to make up your list in alphabetical order... then go through the entire part list, buying item after item, making sure to remember your spot. It can be QUITE tedious indeed. 2021 allows you to immediately search the store for items on your shopping list, making buying all of the parts a fairly painless process. And you can edit your list on the fly, as well - after you buy a part, delete it and move on to the next. Huge time saver!

Next is the fact that a lot of equipment interaction is no longer either simply a ""wait it out"" process or a random process. For example, to ""fix"" a part in 2018, you.... clicked the part at the work bench. Then there was a certain percentage chance that you'd fix the part or damage it further. Nothing other than random dumb luck. Once you upgraded enough the repair was pretty much certain, but still, at that point you're just clicking parts again and again.  CMS added little ""mini games"" for things such as this. Ok, so the mini games are kind of dumb and often give very little of a feel that you're actually doing anything... (For example, at the work bench, to fix a part, a little slider goes left and right really quickly, and you try to time it just right to land on the ""fix"" bar to fix it)... but it DOES break the monotony of click-click-click-click-click that all just depends on dumb luck. So while I could envision better, more relevant mini games, this is definitely a step in the right direction. (Some of them are a LITTLE more relevant, such as the ""alignment"" thing for headlights and wheels. Still not very complicated, but at least related to the task at hand.)

For the equipment that DOESN'T have a mini game, though, the waits aren't nearly as excruciatingly long - and you all from 2018 know what I'm talking about, with the spring compressor, tire changer, and wheel balancer. Yes, they do their jobs much more quickly.

I do like the addition of the brake lathe. I don't know how many brake discs I simply scrapped in 2018. It's nice to be able to re-use these  now :-)

There are other things such as the new ""scraps"" thing which I haven't made extensive use of yet. I'm sure I will at some point, but I've read it doesn't have a ton of impact for the effort, so who knows. I'll find out some other time.

ALSO, the driving handling is significantly better. I don't know if I was just doing something wrong in 2018, but I really didn't care for driving the cars much because it just felt so dumb compared with other driving simulators. 2021, I still get a ""weird"" feeling from the driving, but it's MUCH better, and I don't feel nearly so frustrated trying to control the vehicle.

Overall, this one is a solid ""yes."" I was on the fence for SO LONG, worrying that 2021 would only be a MARGINAL improvement upon 2018, but I was wrong. It's not the difference between night and day - it's still basically the same game with some great improvements - but I'm absolutely satisfied for having pulled the trigger. It IS the better of the two, ESPECIALLY given all the new parts and cars and sheer VARIETY of things to do, on top of an overall graphics improvement. If you're wondering if it's worth it to upgrade from 2018 to 2021, SOLID YES FROM ME",1675386741,1675386741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's the best in the series so far and has a decent gameplay loop. That being said, I'm not recommending it for people who own 2018. 

In 3 years, this studio has not managed to add more than a simple ""time click"" mini-game to the core gameplay. They straight up imported most of the cars from the previous game with only the most minor tweeks. The XP system is still far too grindy and the perk system is almost an exact copy from 2018. 

I really lost some respect for this company when I saw a main story job that was almost verbatim from a main story mission in 2018 with the same parts even needing to be fixed. Talk about directly importing content. 

Fans have even had to make Quality of Life mods just to make the warehouse system somewhat useful. And then we have the driving. You can get an achievement for finishing the track in less than 1m50s. I assume they chose that relaxed time because cars become undriveable with any decent engine and no one would be able to get the achievement otherwise.

I really hoped this game would be a good step for series but I can tell they have done almost nothing in 3 years besides release a dumb number of licensed DLC. If I could give the company some advice, I'd say stop spending money on license deals with car brands and let fans mod the car names in themselves. Instead, work on the gameplay loop and make cars feel more unique. Stop giving us the exact same suspension/brake/transmission parts in every job. Work on driving and get creative with the perk system instead of dumb .05 sec examination bonuses. Here's hoping the next game can actually be unique and inspired instead of a copy paste.",1675353505,1675353505,False,24,0,0.68227231502532959,1,True,False,False

Then you go to the barn/junkyard and pick up a new car to fix! Easy stuff. It can get complicated, but not enough to confuse you. The DLC may seem overwhelming, but im having fun without it for now.

The graphics are really nice and the level of details on the machines, parts and garage are really good. The game play in the beginning is captivating but after some time, when you catch the move it kind of becomes boring. They have added a little bit of fun with the drag racing patch but it would be nicer if they could add some more new features. 

Maybe improve a bit the physics of the cars and add a drifting map. now a new map, only a track on the speed track. Or some more way of modifying parts, some events,  some new real cars (even if i see that they are adding some from time to time).

This game improves on everything I felt 2018 was missing. IMO its one of the best simulators out there. It’s a very hard game to walk away from. Some tasks at times can be tedious (suspension replacement). Building engines and restoring cars is so much fun. I can’t wait to see how this game evolves over the years.
My suggestions/ideas for updates or the next game:

-I would like welding, repairing, washing and painting to be more user involved. This could add hours of gameplay. Grinding and welding frame/body parts would be so much more fun then just clicking one button. Prepping and priming a car for painting could be an entire process as well.

-Some kind of user manual for vehicles, nothing too in depth. Just something I can look through for model and trim types. I don’t like that have to click out of the game to see different trim options for a vehicle or what they are.

-A more in-depth photo mode, I take pictures of all my favorite builds. I would like to see an option where you can arrange a few vehicles and pose them.

-More options for parking your vehicles around your shop. I hate that I can’t see more of my favorite cars at a time.

- Every car in the game to be findable at the junk yard. Even if its crazy low odds (for instance .01% for a Lamborghini), but I think that would add nice little surprises and unanticipated excitement in the game when you go there. I just don’t like buying cars at auction, they are too clean. Every other junk pile has totaled Earthquake parts, but you can’t find the truck in the junk yard. The salon is just pointless IMO for this game at its current state.

I started with the 2018 version and when I started,I had hardly any idea to what the inner workings of an engine were. I hardly knew the name of any part of a car. This has been a very informative game, teaching me the basics of an engine and suspension. While I think this is already a great game, it has a lot of room for improvement. There are no coolant hoses, brake lines, fuel lines, any AC components, the only interior components are the steering wheel and the seats, you cant test drive the cars on the road as many mechanics do to troubleshoot problems, there is no hard-to-reach bolts, and hardly any electrical components.

In a later version I would love to see, possibly in the expert difficulty as a lot of this may be considered more advanced:
-Hoses, electric cables, and lines for the hydraulic systems
-Requirement to torque bolts in certain patterns when needed, maybe add broken bolts or leaks when done improperly
-make the tight-to-reach spaces, as a lot of cars have the awkward placing of certain bolts behind frames and right up against another component
-add additional tools, different sized sockets that need to be switched out when a bolt is a different size
-add more interior components, interior fuse boxes, allow interacting with the cabin air filter and the radio
-add the ability to change light bulbs in the headlights and taillights
-add gaskets and leaks, and add transmission fluid for more maintenance
Since we don't buy cars that need more time in the shop than on the road, I never really have the opportunity to get to work on cars, so I just want a game that gets as close to the real deal as possible. The stuff above would be really cool, but even without it, this is a great game and I highly recommend it if you have an interest in cars, especially if you were like me and knew nothing about them, but wanted to learn. It gives you the basic knowledge of how an engine is assembled.",1674626799,1674626799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1190000,131492126,76561198025581255,570,6,7388,0,6082,1675580675,"Jumping from 2015 to this was interesting.

There's certain parts of this that are strictly better: progression, the shop itself, the variety of vehicles, the varying locations. All of this is good. There's some new complexities in car tires which are functional, if rough, but much more clearly reflect actual reality.

Unfortunately some of these new systems really lack polish. Tires and rims added to the shopping list record their measurements from the car, but when you go to the actual purchase pages they don't auto-fill with these details and there's no way to access the shopping list to see this data. It's annoying having to find a place to jot down notes outside of the game for situations like this.

The official manufacturer DLC is also really odd in context. None of it is consistent with the fake lookalikes from the base game and their imaginary engines. For instance, despite a Nissan R34 lookalike with a fake RB engine being in the base game, the extremely common IRL RB engine swap isn't available for the Nissan S30 from the DLC. The same is also true of the lookalike Toyota Supra, whose IRL 1JZ & 2JZ engines are also popular swap options in many IRL vehicles. None of that real car culture carries over here. The same is also true of rotaries, from the Mazda DLC, which are also unavailable for swaps despite physically fitting into every vehicle in the game. The rotary engines are also arbitrarily missing common performance upgrades shared among other DLC vehicles, making these some of the slowest upgraded and tuned engines in the game. Notably, this is the opposite of how they perform and are utilized in real life.

The game also carries over some oddities from 2015 that it should have left behind. Chief among these are the original 2015 fake engines, which have not been significantly upgraded to improve their realism. Some of these look exceptionally out of place next to the actual masterpieces present in the Pagani and Porsche DLCs. The game also fails to understand the concept of a stud, mechanically, still only using the bolt attachment system from the base game. DLC engines which use studs have them oddly integrated, pre-built, into their individual components. Centerlock wheels from the DLCs are also completely misunderstood by the game, which treats them like standard multiple lug wheels with center hub caps. None of this is game breaking, but these are bad details to get wrong in a game about being a professional car mechanic.

The oddest design decisions come from the performance upgrades in the game. Supercharges and Turbocharges can't just be added to any vehicle or engine like they can IRL. They exist in the game, but only for completely separate engines that have to be entirely swapped to accommodate the performance bolt-on. These components also don't provide performance boosts by increasing effective engine displacement like in real life. Instead, they simply offer flat percentage-based increases of performance along with all the other ""performance"" components you can add to the vehicle. This leads to some very interesting situations that are the inverse of reality. Engines with more components like v12s get many more flat boosts than engines with single turbos. This causes huge engines to exceed 1000 HP without tuning and small turbo engines to struggle to improve performance versus their turbo-less counterparts. This is unintentionally hilarious for how poorly it reflects reality.

There's also some odd choices of what's available and not available for performance upgrades. If you asked most people with IRL performance mods what they did first to their car, aftermarket coil-overs would likely be high on the list. However, they aren't an option in this game. Meanwhile, performance power-steering pumps are readily available in the game's online shop for seemingly every car. I have no idea what a performance power steering pump even is, nor why it would positively influence horsepower. There's a lot of odd choices like this in the game. All clutches are single disc. Springs, retainers, and valves are all built into their heads. Wiring looms are completely omitted on new engines, but always partially included on engines with old-school distributors. In these cases, performance wire options which somehow influence horsepower are always available. Some turbo engines lack inter-coolers and some inter-cooler cars lack turbos. Kits to adapt carbureted engines to fuel injection and vice versa don't exist. Conversion of drum brakes to disc brakes are, likewise, not options even when parts to achieve this already exist in game. All cars also lack parking brakes, as either pads or shoes, and performance break pads are not an option even though performance rotors are. All of this makes the game come across as deeply silly at best, and oddly frustrating at its worst.

However, the oddest thing about the game is that it allows you to purchase, restore, upgrade, and tune vehicles with practically nothing to show for it. Fixed vehicles increase in value to net a profit, but tuning and painting vehicles do not further increase that profit. This would be fine if tuning and painting were their own rewards, but these mechanics are not particularly deep and there's not much to really do with the cars once you've gone through this. you can store the cars in an ""alley"" (effectively a storage unit), but you can't walk around the vehicles and experience them there. The game lacks online components for showing off builds to friends, and there's nothing equivalent to a car meet to showcase your skills and increase your visibility / business within the in-game car community. There is a drag strip and a race track, neither of which is directly indicated to the player, but the game's driving model is incredibly arcade-like for being a simulator. The two feel like very different kinds of experiences and I don't personally understand the cross-over enough to jump from one to the other. I'm here for casual car LEGOs, not high-octane racing action, and the game doesn't even attempt to hold your hand and guide you between one and the other. It's almost like it just threw all this at the wall in the hopes that something would stick. Maybe spending more time with the game will change my mind, but I can't say it currently makes a lot of sense as is.

Barn Finds, The Junkyard, and The Auction Houses are all fine mechanically but I wish they would learn some things from each other. Being able to walk around the auction lot, like you can in the other two settings, would be nice. Having variety to junkyard layouts, like the Barn Finds have, would also be great. It's weird how certain car parts are repairable and other ones arbitrarily aren't, but the mini-games that exist for dealing with these parts work well and are mechanically enjoyable, even if the premise behind them isn't rooted in reality. Speaking of reality, don't expect realistically simulated engine failures. Every part is rated on a 0 to 100% scale of how rusty it isn't, which is hilarious.

All of this is to say the game is good fun. It's silly, it misinterprets some things, and it's going to make some very technical people very frustrated, but it's mostly just good fun. There's no other game where you can place a 24/7 auto-repair shop on the side of Route 66 and have random people bring in their rusty Paganis for simple oil changes. It's a ridiculous and amazing rags to riches story starring you. It moves at your own pace, starting from a mechanic that can barely afford to change someone's oil and ending when you fill up your 5th mini-store-it with your private collection of rare Hyper-Cars and personally decide to call it quits. Make no mistake, there's nothing else quite like this. It's a unique game that does some lovely things, and it's a real breath of fresh air compared to a lot of what's out there. I hope the developers make some changes here, but what's present is still a fun time. Recommended.",1674603996,1674603996,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Overall the game is amazing with new features such as adding fluids, using decrease for the bolts and much more. Added mini games for like balancing out the tire and what not. Being able to go outside of the garage is a major plus as well consider in 18 u where unable to do that. The game is by far a 10 out of 10 for me and the graphics are excellent. However there are a few things that i wish they would have added. Like adding sand paper so that you can sand the car down. The reason this would have been amazing is because alot of the cars that you buy at the junkyard usually end up with alot of rust. That rust will not come off on it own there for there are certain things u may need to get the rust off of the car. That stuff would have been handy. The rust does come off on certain body parts that you can easily take off and replace with new parts but the main thing is the main body of the car. Once u take all of the parts off and u replace it with new parts u will sometimes still see rust on the main body of the car itself. That what would be nice to be able to take off. But beside that the game is by far way better the 18 and i cant wait for new excited updates to come in the near future.",1674592261,1674592261,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

After fvckload of dlc's and updates the game still looks just as raw as decomposed beef.
as much as game still can be fun for first 3 hours of playing it still seems to be poorly made.

It's embarassing that even small games such as My summer car are more immersive if it comes to building/stripping down cars

Instead you should buy:
-Drift 21
-Street legal racing redline which doesn't fvcking work is better anyways

It could really use Vulkan implementation plus FidelityFX, for some reason they refuse to implement it.
Most DLCs have too few cars, mostly less than 5, and even down to 2 cars, which is a missed opportunity.
I wish we could color match car parts to the car, but for some reason they don't believe in different materials painting the same color, which is very frustrating and ruins customization.
Some engines desperately need a revamp, they got carried over from previous versions of the game and look very bad in this version (such as the modern V8 not having camshaft caps, or the timing belts connection to a teethless shaft).
Price is good, both the base game and the DLCs, but is hard to understand why the developer is so stubborn on some very much requested features.
With the release of the Drag Racing DLC the game has improved a lot, but when the game is now centered around racing, having cars with missing performance parts it's a shame, and it shouldn't be so hard, just make a list of all standard parts that can have a performance counterpart and then add them, it's not like is hard, most of the times is the same parts but chrome.

It is getting better every time they release a new one and I'm sure it's only gonna keep on getting better.
There are only two major things I would add to the game that would make it infinitely times better.
First of those two things would be multiplayer. It would make it, in my opinion, from a great game to one of the best games out there. The thought alone of being able to play this with my brother is damn near breathtaking and I am genuinely sad that I can not.
The other thing that this game needs, again, in my opinion, is a much, much, much harder difficulty. Playing the game on any difficulty that is currently available is too easy, and gets too repetitive if you do it too much too fast. I am sure that in about 3 hours of play time I would be able to afford to buy a car, and after fixing it in about 30 minutes that I would be able to just start repeating that process, and 'beat' the game on that save file. So I highly recommend a difficulty that is much more like real life, because I doubt I would be able to afford a car in 3 hours in real life, starting from nothing.

TL:DR
Much needed multiplayer and much needed harder difficulty with a more real life economy.",1673725604,1673725604,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

There are lots of cars, and the repair/rebuild systems are fairly deep. Anyone can see my playtime, and it took me about that long to 100% achievement the game on normal, though you could surely do it faster. There are lots of ""story"" missions, lots of cars one can try to collect, a skill tree - though its more of a brick than a tree - and actual driving mechanics. Overall, worth the $25.

The ""meh"": A lot of the above could be cooler/more fun/more enjoyable than they are. There's plenty to do, but about 100 hours in you're doing much the same thing over and over. The Barn/Auctions/Junkyards are wonky sources of underpriced cars. Most of the cars have the same underlying ""builds"" even if they are completely different models or styles of car. For example, there is only one transmission set up that connects to multiple different gearboxes. The story missions don't have much story to them outside a page of text. The repair shop itself has a lot of character, but not much is done with it. 

The bad: Motion blur. The driving mechanics. If you expect to put any car together with the best parts and no more thought than that, you're gonna immediately roll it on the test track. Or maybe you're better at it than me. 

Overall, a decent game. I hope there's a 2023, or a 2024. My biggest hope is that they improve on the redundant parts of the game. Have fun.",1673236711,1673236711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole game play is way better than 2018 CMS by far! The game has so much potential like add more stuff to the car like hoses cables adding fuel like let's put that gas station to work!!  Also let us drive to junkyard, auctions, barn finds or just a small free roam map in general would be awesome!!

The car handling needs a little work in some places but overall not bad considering the game is a ""car mechanic sim"" not driving sim. 

The customer jobs are a fun way to burn an hour or so. For new players they can be challenging but progressively get more challenging, teaching you how to do stuff as you go. I love the garage customisation and progression as you unlock skill points to equip your shop with more tools like the restoration tools and welder.

If the game is missing anything, I'd say being able to display cars is one of them. You only get five spaces at the workshop for parking which is taken up by orders and barn finds, otherwise it's off site storage. Also when you spend tons of scrap making an awesome 3 Star car it kinda sucks as nobody will ever see it... I think multiplayer would be a fun addition as kicking back, working together on a car with some mates could be enjoyable.

Overall the game as a whole is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about cars and how they work. Getting money in this game is not extremely difficult and creating your own builds (engine swapping) is fun. Also the dyno and paint booth open possibilities for veterans keeping the game fresh.",1671189421,1671189421,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ideas for the next iteration.

It would be cool to have more options for engines and I would personally like to just start out with a lump sum of cash and just fix up and resell cars.  There’s not really an option for that.

It would also be cool to turn off the mini games.  They were fun at first, but became super tedious later on.

Ability to build cars and race against other players or have some kind of showcase where you could build cars and people could visit/drive your cars

 eventually the game will do that, however not being a gamer the amount of stuff i have to remember to operate the computer to do the screen task is excessive because some of the things done are automatic in life but the game has me going through each step and too many steps to remember if your not a gamer

The ""normal"" way of playing; taking orders and fixing customers issues is probably the worst way to make money, unless you choose the jobs with the most expensive parts.

I found it easy to navigate around the map and was disappointed the car salon did not offer a lot more choices.

Instead, you will be able to rebuild an entire engine within minutes. But there is still a great sense of achievement and satisfaction when you are looking at a shiny new car, where an hour ago was just a pile of rusty parts. Ah and yeah obviously car go vroom.
I'm still wondering how they are not getting sued for copying cars with minor differences and then just calling them e.g. FMWs.

The only thing you could knock it on is that you can only have 2 car hoists where as 2018 you could have 3 hoists. 9 hours in I can feel I will be getting my moneys worth with this game.. many more hours play left in it.

Still a couple of things I would like to see implemented... 

I would like to be able to drive my cars around my garage, Who does not want to leave a big skid in their driveway after building a supercharged monster.

I would like to be able to cruise the streets in my cars, drive to the POI's instead of just clicking map and clicking Auction then teleporting there.. would be much cooler to jump in ya Hot Rod and drive to the Junkyard or where ever.. or just go for a cruise.

Pro's - More cars om the basic game, the introduction of EV's to the franchise in the Electric Car DLC, the introduction of fluids to be changed other than just oil, the introduction of fuses, relays and ECU's, Got rid of the RNG repair game and replaced it with a mini game that means a 92% quality part won't be completely destroyed if you fail to repair it, the introduction of a car washing and detailing bay, better junkyard experience, more parts can be now be painted,  the range of performance parts has been expanded to more than just engine parts and gearboxes, etc...

Cons - Only 2 lifters in the garage instead of the 3 from the last game, car parking for owned cars is now just a row of garage doors instead of a multi-storey car parking facility and you cannot freely walk up and down the row of cars you own,",1637924641,1669290069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

It's been a really tough time trying to work out if i would recommend this game to someone or not and after a long time of thinking about it, i have to say i wouldn't. 

The game is just too much like 2018, There is really no major differences to warrant spending the full price on this game when you can just get basically the exact same game (with better DLC *Currently*) in the 2018 version. I love this game, don't get me wrong, as someone who loves cars, this is a great time waster/chill game to just chip away the time at, however, the actual *story* missions in the game get very repetitive (as they would when you can only sort, engine/drive-train/suspension/bodywork, there's only so many variants you can do i suppose!)

The biggest issue i have with the game is the totally pointless spreading out of all the points of the garage! i was so hyped to see we finally get paint-able mechanical parts! to then find out that instead of having my spray booth in my garage like 2018 (nice and convenient!!) i now have to leave the garage, go over the small road then through into the spray booth. the same is for the test path, car wash and dyno! the biggest pain in the hole though, is why does my garage not even have a work bench to begin with?? i have to pay to have a work bench in my garage AFTER i save up to get an extension to my garage first?? why can i have a bloody massive school bus in my garage but not a work bench?? and even when i do finally get a work bench, i have to leave my garage to go into a separate part of my garage to repair items! WHY WOULD I NOT HAVE A WORK BENCH NEAR MY RAMPS?!?! select to take your car into the garage onto the ramps and for some reason it puts you at the side of the ramp without the controls? this seems completely useless to me and just really annoying more than a big game issue.

Auctions!! 
These once again, although better set out, are still mostly the AI ensuring you will rarely get a good deal on a car. start an auction as many times as you like and don't bid and the price will normally be lucky to clear 50% of it's estimated value. start a bid and actually bid through for any car and i bet 8/10 times the bots will drive you up to market value and generally higher. super annoying again! Bidder 1 Coming in Outta No Where! 

PARTS UPGRAGES!!
This is by far the biggest con and the most annoying part of the game as i have found out playing more! you need scrap to upgrade parts via the upgrade bench, outside in a container, obviously! However what is massively annoying is the time it takes to actually fully upgrade everything and the sheer effort that needs to go into doing so!! i decided (for some stupid reason) to fully upgrade every part on my fully modified turbo'd Supa, and compare against an identical non upgraded fully modified turbo Supa to see if there was any real point to doing so. i started off with 7,500+ scrap, which i thought would have been more than enough to get me through the build, however it was no where near enough to get through the build! i hardly allowed me to upgrade the entire rear end! i then needed to keep trying to pick up parts, then trying to convert it to actual scrap, which is where the biggest issue lies! the value for scrap is so far out of wack it literally makes no sense and is totally unfair on the player. For instance, a piston ring or even a rod cap will on max scrap, allow you 3 scrap, but guess what? a massive front subframe or even some body panels, only offer 3 scrap!! how the hell can i get 3 scrap from tiny pieces yet massive ones i get the same amount?!!?! yeah you occasionally get engine blocks that offer 26 etc but again this is only if you land on 1 block out of the however many there is to land on and is totally not right in my opinion and drags out and totally makes it worthless to upgrade car parts as the time put into actually getting the items upgraded is not nearly worth the out come. 
UPGRADE TURBO SUPA HP GAIN 169+/-
NON-UPGRADED TURBO SUPA HP GAIN 145+/-
Not worth the time in my eyes and needs fixing!

so basically, i don't really rate the game more than 2018, i honestly feel they would have been better making a big update DLC for 2018 rather than making this a full game on it's own. maybe with more time and a lot of fine polishing, this might become the proper game it deserves to be!

Positives;
Paint-able Mechanical Parts
Better Repair System 
Better Race Track/Top Speed Track
Finally Added Upgraded Brake Discs! 
Better Paint options and a couple more modified parts.
Window Tinting! 
Tune Friendly ECUs!
Drag Racing!

Negatives; 
Stupid Spaced Out Buildings!!
No Real Increase in New Vehicles 
Story Mode Pretty Repetitive
Auctions Still all Over The Place

It is a complete upgrade with enhanced gameplay compared to its older selves. In addition to more options while in the shop, you've now got a property where multiple buildings and other ""garages"" can be made out into a paint shop, junk space, car wash, and more. There are more options for the test track and race track. The junkyard, barns, and dealerships all offer new and different ways to obtain more cars and parts.

The vanilla game you buy is excellent, but I must say, getting some of the paid DLC + community DLC makes this game shine a lot brighter. Across the board, every new car model you add to the game breathes extra life into nearly every facet of the game. Not only does it add new cars, but new parts, liveries, customizable options for other cars, a better variety mix when salvaging, junking, barn hunting, and more. If you buy this game, I implore you to at least check out the free DLC the modding community has to offer as a lot of it is pretty rad.

All-in-all, the ~66 hours I put into this game were great and I absolutely recommend it. I'm not really a car enthusiast and I know nothing about car work or mechanics. So, it's still a wonder how I came to like this series so much but it largely is due to the excellent work Red Dot Games has put into it.

---------------------------

To be more specific; I love the CMS series. But its kinda gotten stale. The same mechanics, not really a lot of new stuff, and I bet its just going to be another DLC queen. Its just starting to seem like a cash grab instead of a game. There could've been wayyyy cooler mechanics for the minigames instead of just ""Ooo will you click green or red who knows"". I really wish there was some kind of physical tool you could use to repair body panels and paint things your own way. It would be cool if you could cut out your own stencils to make your own liveries on cars. This game could've gone so many different ways than it did.

What I would have liked to have seen:

- As mentioned above, more in depth painting ability. Right now its pretty lack luster.

- The repair system and ""upgrade"" system make very little sense. There could've been so much more here if you just looked, tools to repair certain parts where you use the mouse to shave off rust and knock out dents with hammers. The tech tree could've accompanied this with those specific tools instead of just ""Hee hoo here's a repair table""

- The fact that you can chop shop cars with no repercussions is startling. The customer never ever comes back to check on their car? They just trust you'll take care of it forever? Come on now. The customers themselves could use work. They could be actual physical people who drop off their cars to you. Drive up and just leave it for ya to repair. You could've had ""Day/Night"" cycles where customer cars have a certain period you have to get them done by before the customer starts getting angry. Customers should also notice if you've changed their tires to be the absolute cheapest you could find. Its ridiculous the amount of things you can get away with.

The cars themselves seem just repeated every single game. There's a couple of new ones which is nice, but the engines are mostly the same, the mechanics for repairing the engines is mostly the same, and everything is just kinda bleh now. There's nothing NEW or EXCITING about CMS anymore.

ECU Tuning is matching bars together. Don't get to actually adjust the ECU. Same thing with carburetors. Can't change the timing, can't change the cam lobe size, can't adjust your lifters, can't adjust your suspension, can't adjust your camber/tow, can't adjust ANYTHING. Testing tools are useless (again). Easier to just take apart the car and find the part that's broke (Have to do it anyways so might as well).

However, what it lacks are some key things to keep the majority engaged beyond the honey moon phase of the simulation experience. Here are some of the things that can be done to elevate the experience.
1. I know this is not an easy fix by any means but it would be nice to have car specific parts rendered in. You will see time after time that cars (no matter the manufacturer or model) share the the same brake system, suspension, coolant, power steering, filters, and many many more identical components. This takes you completely out of being immersed and starts to get mundane after time. The great thing about being in mechanics is feeling like you have mastered a specific manufacturer or model due to your experience with it. This game doesn't make you feel that passion. I would start by at least creating unique parts by for each manufacturer so that high end cars get that feeling of being exotic.
2. Day to day cycling should be a thing here. The leveling progression should be complemented with an in game time clock or calendar cycle. To fix this when you accept a job you should be assigned a number of days to complete the job. Then you should need to review the vehicle and order parts, parts should not be instantly provided from shopping, the parts should come the  next day and some parts 2 to 3 days (unless you pay for rush shipping). The player should have to 'end the day' to proceed, kinda like life. Adding this challenge for the player of timing the part arrivals to meet the deadlines is huge. When your parts come in and you can finish the job it releases more space in your shop for the next job. I would also add a time clock slider and allow players to select their shift hours. The slider can control the ratio of ""in game"" time passage vs real time to scale a day/night cycle. You can then see how many 'hours' it took you in game to perform the repair, leverage that against the job earnings to make this feel more like a real shop. The better you get, the less time it takes you to do the tasks, the more tasks you can do per shift, the more profit you turn and the feeling of accomplishment will grow.  This adds more authenticity to the experience, makes the player feel rewarded and skilled, and negates the current feeling I get when playing ""that I'm fixing 1000 cars a day"" which isn't realistic by any means.  Also, have several procedural jobs the player can review so they can pick 2 or 3 at the start (progression to 5 or 6 dependent on shop slots that open as you upgrade) that they want to perform for that 'calendar day' and the flow of the game will feel much better. As they upgrade the shop the ability to perform more jobs would carry over providing the feeling of growth with purpose. If they select to many jobs and can't complete them in the day/night cycle time to meet the job deadlines, then they get bad customer reviews which impacts XP or restricts certain jobs until the player reaches 5 star rating level. To me this is the element that would push me most to desire playing the game. By challenging myself to reach higher shop production, profit and quality per day cycle.
3.  A minor improvement requested. Steering with keyboard control is terrible. There should be an option for controller support or a selection to change to mouse steering. I never understood why mouse steering isn't a thing, allow me to change to head movement with the mouse when holding right click and when i let go of the right click control the wheel again. Just in case i want to look around. If there is a way to fix this, please let me know. But right now testing or track running cars just isn't as enjoyable as it should be.

Anyway..these are a few big things that I wish the developers would considered changing. 

As i support simulation titles as a whole, and genuinely believe the future of our education system and OJT programs will rely heavily on virtual simulations for career development, I'm recommending this title in support of this developer and those like them.

It's quite a bit more simplistic than a real car but you can still learn a little bit about the main components, like what's the purpose of an inner & outer tie rod, etc.

I wished they had a few more simulator mini-games where you would use the pressure washer to clean the car yourself instead of just clicking one button and the whole thing is done.  I also wished they made you drive the car in/out of the garage, to the washing bay, etc.  Would be so much more immersive.

It's a great continuation/improvement over previous releases of Car Mechanic Simulator.  If you enjoyed the previous releases you will definitely enjoy this one.  Cheers!",1667758133,1667758133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Have a ""Mark All"" button for car parts that need replacing, to mark all parts at once rather than going thru each page, one item at a time....

2. Un-Mark the parts after they've been properly replaced.

3. Add the mark feature to body parts? Thought this was obvious...

4. Auto save WAY MORE OFTEN..... I bought a car at auction, replaced absolutely everything except the tires and the game crashed and I reverted all the way to before I bought the car at auction....  lost 1+ hours of progress.

5. For $300 you should be able to call in help to find a part that you may be struggling on.

6. Make the Engine Lift more intuitive and obvious. Took me forever to realize I could add it to the other engine lift in the repair room.

7. There should be a way to estimate the amount one will need to complete a repair (replacement parts etc) and how much of a reward it will give.",1667689984,1667690035,False,14,1,0.56680828332901001,0,True,False,False

The workshop also became less impressive.... i mean you cant even completely clean the garbage, and let me mention the fact that its actually smaller than the workshop in the cms18?

You inherit or purchase an older garage and start off taking vehicle maintenance and repair jobs.  You can perform some troubleshooting, vehicle inspection, and part replacement at first, then work your way up to a full-service vehicle restoration shop: Part and panel repair, car wash, detailing, window tinting, painting, wheel and headlight alignment, and dyno testing. You can purchase wrecks from the junkyard to rebuild, hit auctions to buy cars in various conditions, find old and forgotten vehicles in barns, or purchase them brand new if you so choose.  This game does the treatment of vehicle components and assembly well and the leveling system that lets you improve your abilities, add to your garage, and improve overall game play efficiency doesn't feel taxing -- but can be gamed if you pay attention. The spray booth can create some interesting paint colors and appearances and many of the cars come with liveries to add racing stripes, racing regalia, or even business logos.  

As a ""backyard mechanic"" I've found that I have one sticking complaint: I feel that some of the requirements are a bit too strict in regards to removal and installation of parts. For example, removing the wheel hub assembly, including potentially the attached braking components, is something that can be done IRL but not in this sim, and steering hub housings are required to be placed (read: Left dangling with nothing holding it in-place) before attaching the appropriate control arms. While this is a minor gripe, it can be a little immersion breaking.  Additionally, while the music included with the game isn't bad in any sense, the playlists are rather short and become repetitive. While you have the ability to add your own music and create your own playlists, this relies on having the music files stored on your PC or accessible via a cloud connection, meaning if you're using a music streaming service you will be turning it off instead of using the in-game radios for control.

Overall, I do like this game, as my 404 hours of game play can attest.  My minor gripes are just that: Minor.",1666300150,1666300150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games, I've put 25 hours into it so far and I've had it less than 3 days. It's not too difficult to level up but it is not easy either. You will have to grind a bit to make money and unlock tiers and also gain skill points. I did not purchase anything major till today, I got the first level garage expansion and paint shop but I waited till I had enough funds stacked and not be left penniless. You can't fix cars if you can't buy the parts. So yea, you have to be thinking ahead always. I like that part, being strategic is very important to growing and it is a business so you want to be successful. There are more pros but I'm not going to mention each one. The graphics are really good and the game runs quite well with no lag or nasty stutters. Your experience may not be the same as mine but it's not a really resource intensive game. I run on the max settings and have no problems whatsoever.
The CMS 2021 has a lot to offer in their workshop. Take a look around and see some really good creations.
The price is fair and I'd buy this game any day for the regular cost. If it were a few bucks more I'd say wait till it's on sale.
Now the Cons:
Quirky ways of moving around under the car or in the engine area, it should be simple to go from removal and installing of parts. It's not always so, I end up with my face inside of tires or motors just because it's how this game works. You can click through to each spot you want to move to next but it can get quite frustrating sometimes. I decided to just use ESC and move to the next location I want to get to on the vehicle. It's better than clicking around every car part till it gets you close to where you want to be. Honestly it is also less disorienting and I don't end up inside a car wheel.
Another con is that the pay is quite low starting out for most jobs. It should be adjusted so you're not getting an unrealistic amount for the work involved. Maybe the dev studio is not quite attuned to how much it really costs to have this work done. They don't take into account the cost of materials and labor. It just does not add up at all and I have noticed that sometimes you may barely make enough to cover the parts alone and you're getting basically nothing for your labor. That is a huge fail to me and it needs to be addressed. I'd really like to see that changed because it will cause you to struggle and you get hardly anything when selling off the old parts. Yet you have to sell the old parts to make something because scrapping them is only useful when you can afford to expand and buy work benches. The grind and struggle are real when you start out, but it should be more balanced.
This is the gist of my review of what I really like and things that could be better, the details hopefully convey the reasons why I hit on certain points mentioned. It's just my own opinion, I do like the game and I definitely will keep playing CMS 2021.

For anyone who has Intel Graphics and takes the chance of ""GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT Intel Integrated Graphics Cards"" and still purchases... I am here to tell you... it is true.  (Currently running: Intel Iris XE and MAX Graphics.)

If you go and apply all the Lowest Quality Settings, it is like a PowerPoint slide show and not smooth, but it is tolerable (29 hours played on Intel Graphics) if you don't crave high performance on every game you play.
If you have all the Highest Quality Settings, you have now gone to Warp speed and you can no longer do anything without major motion blur and massive frame rate drops... now it's unplayable. 

Just putting my two cents in for someone considering overlooking the graphics requirements.

Edit: We REALLY NEED a more regular Autosave, game's been freezing on me a lot lately and making me lose 30 minutes to an hour of progress. Would be great if we can add a time interval in the settings. Won't be editing this review until we get this feature.

In the meanwhile. I'd suggest buying Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 instead, in a sale. Never experienced any crashes or freezes in that game.

You can learn a lot about where parts are located, how you can change them etc. Ofcourse in a very simplified way.
There's a wide variety of car models with unique to the brand parts placement.

flaws:
The tutorial is not really nonproductive for a very new player of the CMS games.
A lot of struggle with blue parts farm.
The drag/speed track is not very keyboard+mouse friendly. If you tune up your car you will have hard time keeping it straight.
The shopping is kind of annoying to use. Would've been great if items from shopping list disappeared after you buy the part.
The warehouse is absolutely useless at the stage it is.

I bought that game because I didn't know a single thing about mechanic and thought it's be fund to venture through another fun sim.

I love this game... but...
If you are at all sensitive, you will get horrible motion sickness.... even after just one minute.
You can mitigate some motion sickness by playing at the lowest graphics settings to get the highest frames per second possible, but even then, the game causing motion sickness will severely limit your ability to play for any length of time
Many first person games do not cause motion sickness, and we know what causes motion sickness in the 21st century... and it is not the gamers' monitors or PC's, so don't gaslight us. This is entirely the responsibility of the developer.

By far my number one game played throughout 2022.  DLC expansions of remastered packs from the previous games in the franchise have been a blast with more still in the pipeline from Red Dot Games.  There is not enough praise on how CMS21 completely time sinks from painting all the individual parts, to part refurbishment, warehouse management and garage customisation.

Easy 10/10

☑ Detailed Engines from Inline-3 to V12's.
☑ Addictive once familiar with the mechanics.
☑ Fantastic mixed electro/dubstep soundtrack.
☑ Aesthetically pleasing bolt and part removal sounds.
☑ For newcomers: Hard to learn but easy to master.
☑ Story Jobs help you learn to diagnose & repair
☑ Infinite scraps, auctions and jobs available
☑ Steep XP & cash grind for the first 3-4 hours max.
☑ Gold bundle price (especially on sale) is a no brainer
☑ Very rare to zero bugs

I feel like my only gripe with the game is probably the scraping mechanic. For those who don't know or have the game there is a way to scrap parts that can't be repair to gain a Blue Currency to use to improve parts on cars. From what I noticed the improvement is mostly just for the bragging right to say all parts on my car has 3 stars because the amount of value it increase on the total value of the car is so small compared to how many parts you would have to scrap to get that.

The car gives an accurate representation of how a car is put together. I went from knowing nothing about cars to being able to go to my car and be able to understand alot of the parts. It was really cool to learn how the engine works, the suspension, brakes. It definitely takes some time to grind the levels and unlock everything but once you fully repair a car and get your credits its very satisfying. Now there are story orders and other orders. The story orders you have to take and usually have a good story behind them. 

I only have around 55 hours on this game but play it a ton its a very chill and relaxing game to play while still being very entertaining. All the cars you start with have fake names on them to avoid copyright but the DLC do have real cars. I dont recommend buying the DLC right away as there are plenty cars to start with. However once you do start playing the game I say go for the DLC cars that look the most exciting to you. I highly recommend this game!! Even if you have wanted to learn how cars work go for it.

Additionally in the steam workshop you can add more cars just by subscribing. However some do require DLC for certain parts.

It all happens naturally as you play the story.  Troubleshooting is fun.  Building cars from scratch is fun and rewarding to take out and test.  Picking cars is a surprising dopamine hit.  My biggest grips would be as you progress in the story almost all of the later ones are complete engine rebuilds.  While I dont mind rebuilding the engine occasionally,  having to take one completely apart to get a crank shaft for one story, then pistons and rings for another story just wears thing pretty quickly.  It feels like 7/10 story jobs Ive done have required the engine to be significantly disassembled.  

The 2nd issue I have is jobs have a minimum repair level a replaced part needs to be.  For examples sake lets say its 80%.  You only have to replace parts that are below 25%.  So the game requires you to specifically put the part above 80% in the bad parts spot.  You could have multiple similar parts of varying levels of wear, and they are fine and dont need to be replaced, but if you put one of them in the replacement part spot and it doesnt meet the replacement threshold its marked as incomplete.  Now this is fine on the car, where you can highlight the exact part that needs the replacement.  However when you take the engine out this feature does not work.  So your stuck memorizing exactly which parts need to be replaced with the new part or else youll be stuck rebuilding the engine all over again.   I eventually circumvented this by just buying all new parts for the engine when it was in question.  But that didnt really feel like a good resolution to my problem as a player.

Overall, good game I just feel like engine work could be a little better for player experience.",1661869383,1661869383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The steering is so sensitive its borderline uncontrollable as well.. So maybe you can just be a restore junky(My guilty pleasure), well... You can't even take your restored cars to auction..

Good things:
* Getting to take apart and reassemble various cars is the main draw here.
* You get to see a lot of different components (and different types of components) and learn how they work with the rest of the components.
* ""Story"" cars have amusing backstories.
* Generally pretty easy going. Has enough handicaps to allow you to easily repair most cars (as long as you can find all the broken parts).
* A good variety of cars, from modern to 50+ year old models, and lots of variety in the types/origins - Japanese, American, German/European; muscle, sports, standard passenger cars. Although real-life names aren't used (except in DLC and Workshop content), it's often clear where the inspiration comes from.

Bad things
* Some stuff is simplified for sure. For example, there is no implementation of things like brake lines. If brakes aren't working, you can just replace the discs, calipers, pads, ABS Pump, and ABS unit (name?). No transmission fluids; just oil, washer fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid.
* It seems like some of the translations/objectives are somewhat unclear. For example ,""paint with factory paint."" Does that just mean ONLY the default factory paint assigned when you go to the paint shop? Also, if the driver doesn't want their company/dad to know the car had to be repaired, why would painting it a slightly different color be acceptable?
* Any parts that are damaged just show up as rusty, and if you inspect them, you learn their ""condition"" percentage. Personally I would like a little more variety in this, as in real life, a new part that was damaged in a recent accident wouldn't just be completely rusted out. Maybe show bent or cracked parts? Idk - I'm not a car repair expert.
* Why is it that some kinds of parts just can't be repaired? It makes sense for something like Brake pads. But muffler components?
* Adding a lot of Workshop content makes the ""junkyard"" and ""barn"" unusable. If you download a pack with 30 different varieties of Ford Mustang, every other car/part you find could be some version of a Mustang, when you might be trying to find components from a different particular car model. would like to have an ""activate/deactivate content"" menu.",1661121596,1661121596,True,26,0,0.772053658962249756,0,True,False,False

 I feel like all cars of same model are identical, if you buy auction or barn car, they are always very consistently damaged all over. It missing a ""reason"" why it was parked/owner don't want it. IMHO something like modifiers should be added to the game, that tell a bit greater story than 3 stars almost identical to the others. 

lets say car could have tiny backstories, that gives some parts better or worse condition. Stuff like:

""hail damage"" (very  damaged body, but internally ok), ""cracked block"", ""wrong fluids"", ""pothole"" (one wheel missing or very damaged, with suspension around it), ""running without oil"", few types of crashes, flood damage, smoker driver, ""hidden damage/pearl"" (something that was ignored while auctioning, so car value is different than ""estimated"", and you can find it by examining), parts with stars already, etc. Pick 0-3 out of that list, and restore parts of the car, not whole thing each time. 
would make restorations much more interesting, and less repetitive. I am sure devs could find a way for it to be great. Hide some of the modifiers from us when we buy a car, and show some, and it will not get boring for a while. 

btw, auctions suck, they are to consistently knowing value of the car. Please modify their ranges so they stop bidding in 80-130% range of car value.

It feels very much like a console port. Designed to be played with a controller only.
Example radial menus, when you have a whole keyboard full of buttons available.
Specifically the two things you do the most is take parts off the car and put parts on the car. In order to change which of those two modes you are in you first have to access the radial menu and then find the selection to change mode and click on it. So much easier to do if you had a button to toggle between modes, preferably one you could remap to whatever you want. That is just one example.

If you don't even know how to change the coolant, or what an alternator is then I recommend getting this game ASAP. It will teach you all the BASICS about car maintenance and repair. It shows you where all the MAJOR components are for the Engine, Suspension, Drive train etc. but it won't include anything detailed such as wiring, electrical system or hoses. It's the perfect game for a hobbyist who wants to learn more about cars and has plenty of stuff to do to keep you entertained for a long time.

The Bad:

The game doesn't offer enough information about the components or what they do, for a truly learning experience it should have plenty of information of what each component is and how it works. Right now the game is on a limbo where is too basic in most areas but at the same time the lack of info can make it complicated for a beginner.

The DLC is bad, some of it like the Mazda and Lotus DLC only include 2 cars and that's it. I think the Nissan one is better though. 

Quite a bit of a grind when getting started, making money and XP is really hard at the beginning and it will take some time before you can do cool stuff like car restoration from the Junk yards and barns.

Overall, I recommend this game. It has a lot of stuff to do and it can teach you the basics, but it's still a long way from a proper mechanics game. I wish in the future there is a much complex (Closer to real life) engine bay with all the components even if there are less variety in cars.

On the Cons side:
I'd like to have more graphics options tho to turn off some effects.
Parking lot was downgraded sc. 2018, also devs took away one car lift from your garage =)

Honestly speaking, 2021 has less value for me compared to 2018 because you cannot even browse your cars collection lie it was done in 2018 on big parking where all your cars was shown.

There is a small community of modders that add content to the game such as new vehicles, but the people themselves are irreproachable, and not willing to even answer questions. You're on your own. There is a discord channel where everyone seems to congregate from the developers down to the common players. Good luck getting answers from anyone. It's a very unfriendly community.

On the bright side,  the graphics in the game are very photo realistic and the game play will eat every moment of your free time if you're into this type of game. As for a recommendation, to be honest, I'm torn.

Some things that should be intuitive have extra unnecessary steps, and many procedures are fundamentally wrong.

Some examples:
In order to pull engine heads, you must remove the camshafts (and every cap and bolt that entails). That's silly and isn't something any mechanic would do unless they were changing the camshafts.

All of the fluids besides oil are missing every other step of the process for each fluid. Brake fluid is syringed from the reservoir, but you don't drain or bleed the brakes at the wheels. Coolant is syringed from the reservoir, if there is one, otherwise it is syringed from the radiator fill cap. There is no bleeding step. Further, if there is no reservoir and you refill coolant at the radiator, you only need to fill it to roughly 3/4 full, or you can top it off as much as you like, and you are penalized for spilling fluids if you fill it until it overflows. Power steering fluid is also drained at the reservoir, but not the rack.

Occasionally there are cars that have serpentine belts and pulleys that get removed out of order. For example, the idlers before the belt, or idlers before the tensioner. There's some layouts where the alternator would be the tensioner, but you don't need to do anything at all to remove the belt.

Some cars have ignition wires, some just have coil packs and no wires, and of course there are no connections going between major components, so, no wiring harness, grounding wires, battery cables, brake lines, coolant hoses, throttle cables, fuel lines, etc...

Oil filters can typically only be removed with the car fully raised on the lift, even if the filter is obviously accessible from the hood.

The wheel bearing is removed before the hub, on all four corners. Typically you install these in the knuckle before the hub, or they're part of the hub assembly. Also, CV axles can be removed without disassembling any links at the knuckle, which is a dream fantasy lol. Typically you have to loosen the tie rod end, or a shock assembly, or an entire arm.

I've played like six hours but I'm sure to continue finding inaccuracies like these. It's a bit immersion breaking, and for some things inconvenient too. I would go on but I want to return to playing now, and that's why it's recommended.

edit:
Some things i would love to see in the future:

○ valvetrain components: valves, valve springs, porting, cylinder boring. Procedures like head decking and port polishing.
○ gaskets, and maybe even bolts in your inventory that must be restocked from a vendor. special large OEM bolts.
○ service manuals for cars instead of the guided linear path.
○ brake lines, coolant hoses, cables and wiring harnesses. Simple but realistic procedures for fluids and disconnect/reconnect.
○ special hand tools for parts that have multiple methods for disassembly. for example, ball joint pullers, pickle forks, BFH, your mom's purse.
○ make the minigames more engaging--the game for fluids should be avoiding spills, like those early web Flash games. Pulling an engine could include balancing it on the hoist. Placing the car on the lift, driving it in/out of the shop, all these things that are just radial menu clicks now could be much more immersive",1659311363,1659312391,True,94,4,0.891471505165100098,0,True,False,False

This game taught me so much about cars that I am still amazed each time I run it. It is very detailed and it's visible that people have spent a lot of hard work to deliver such detail and great gaming experience. If you imagine any car mechanic simulator, it has to be like this one.

However, one thing is quite funny: A lot of jobs you get are something like ""Please restore the original performance"", ""I think I heard some knocking sounds"" or ""I think it needs some attention"" and when you put it on the test track it sais that the engine doesn't even start. I take this as a forgivable joke, since the rest of the game is that amazing. Though, it's pretty funny and quite unrealistic for a simulator.

First of all: if you have played the 2018 version (as I have) you can safely give this one a miss.
It's the same game just more polished.  

There are things that seem to hint at good stuff, tuning and drag strips...but it's a big missed opportunity, if anything.

There are still a good number of things seemingly there just to mess with the player and slow your progress (eg putting you on the wrong side of the lift when you get a new car in).

The story missions dry up after a while, quite abruptly and seemingly in the middle of things: another missed opportunity ( could have used tasks to prepare cars for racing, tune them, etc )

But the biggest problem is the lack of challenge.

It's very easy, just slow, there's no problem making money (the best trick is still to get a wreck and just replace everything with all-new components) and fixing cars does not take anything but time.

You don't even need all the different tools to check what's wrong: it's clearly visible by its rust level.

No combination, no brain needed, just click-click-click.

The only way to create some semblance of a challenge is the hard mode; it'll hide a lot of information.  Still not the kind of challenge I expect from a computer game; you just need to learn where the bolts are.

I was really waiting for the game to bloom with the tuning, but alas; the story stopped and the only reason to tune cars is really for your own amusement.   Meh.",1659095450,1659095450,False,19,0,0.670949697494506836,0,True,False,False

Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

I am a long time fan of this series and I've been playing the games ever since CMS 2014 and I was having a blast and then 2015 came along and I had even more of a blast even though that game was a bit boring and lacking in content.

the real turning point in this series was CMS 2018, it introduced so much new stuff into the game. New cars, new parts, a repair table, tuning, dyno, more tools, more customization, more skills, the ability to buy used cars and flip them for a profit. It was great fun, and I was really excited for CMS 2021.

I picked it up on release and after 10 hours or so I realized this is exactly like CMS 2018 with a fresh coat of paint, some new cars and a few QOL improvements here and there. We've been waiting 3 years for this? Everything you can do in CMS 2018 you can do here, it's no different, except for some ""new"" mechanics.

And I say ""new"" because these mechanics are in CMS 2018 but were recycled and improved for this game. Overall, this game is really disappointing for old fans of the series, but, it's a great game on it's own for people who have never played CMS before.",1658935694,1658935694,True,89,1,0.882476687431335449,3,True,False,False

First of all, there is a lot of choice with vehicles.  Here’s a list of the Pro and Cons 

Pros
72 + Nissan + electric car dlcs
Scrap and upgrading parts
Paintable Parts
Fluids 
Salvage Auction
New Salon with a config a new vehicle
The use of DW-04 (WD-40) lube spray for stuck bolts
Workshop mods on release.

Cons
Missing Performance Parts that will not ever be seen since CMS 2018
Banning of DLL Mods. Which makes modding and making config harder to find in the game.
Restrictions on the workshop
lack of communication from Red Dot Games.

Again that's just me. A little more realism into the game would have been the perfect balance between game play and the ""high level of realism"" which the game developers have claimed.

This sort of game-breaking situation just isn't acceptable. Thank goodness I wasn't deeper into the game I guess. Here's the fuller story:

First, I ran low on money as I was completing a job. I tried to disable the cost to travel to other locations b/c I couldn't afford the fee for the junkyard. I changed the settings mid-game, and then when I tried to travel to the junkyard I got a black screen and the game would never load. I tried reverting the change, saving, going to the main screen, then changing the settings from there (rather than within my session), and still no dice.

Okay, I guess I'll take on additional jobs that are cheap to make some money so I can afford the expensive part for the previous job. I complete the repairs on this second job and try to finish the job by changing out the fluids. But the Drain Tool won't work b/c the game is in the middle of auto-saving. It stays mid-save and never completes. I give up and quit out, do some of the job over again, and this time try to manually save. Still no dice. At this point I just give up since I seemingly can't save the game any longer.

Also: Apparently there used to be a few cheat codes in the 2018 version so if you were like me and found yourself low on funds you could just cheat past it. It seems they removed this in the 2021 version.

The game is amazing. 
Some tips:
- be very carefull with Your balance in the beginning. Dont take story orders under 20k if You can. Or dont try to finish, take normal orders if Your balance going down to 10k
- barns are very good place to get cars, however you will have to very carefully mesaure, if you can upgrade the car
Later on:
- when you have your own projects. do always 4 times 100%, You can check in the car status page. plus headlights and wheels alignment, paint shop. also everything from tuning shop, what can you buy. this maximize the profit.
- buy high value cars on auctions, those makes the biggest profit
My usual workflow, to get literally everything out from the car, and go to the repair tables. This can save a lot of money.

Oh CMS, you have always had so much potential, yet you continue to refine the same formula. They've added some new minigames from 2018, but the core remains unchanged, and that's not necessarily bad. The minigames mostly boil down to click here to stop the ticker type games.. not really engaging.

If you enjoyed 2015/2018 this is more of the same with a bit more polish.  The cars are greatly detailed, and the components are accurate enough to teach folks a bit about what that doodad or thingymajig is called. There is more than enough to have fun in the base game, I'd only recommend the DLC's if you really enjoy that brand of vehicle, otherwise there is really not much point. The vehicle tuning system is unexplained, and really gives no guidance. The vehicle handling is terrible... so basically just like 2018. The story missions are completely irrelevant. It's just another job with a paragraph of flavor text. You never really get any depth or connections. It's really a missed opportunity imo.

That being said though, all in all It's a great way to click away some time if you enjoy feeling like you took a piece of junk and make it shiny and go vroom!

Some suggestions for improvement:
1. Give a Info button that will give basic information about parts and how they work to further educate folks.
2. Expert mode should allow you to fail a job by missing a part without warning you.
3. Add some tuning tools to the Dyno shop to allow you to tune without over-tuning to ridiculous. Maybe expert mode should allow for blowing out components if you really get crazy.
4. Create an actual story-line, maybe you get signed up to be a mechanic for a a race team, maybe you work with a Baja offroad team, maybe you work on Top Gear like show I don't know.. something more than ""I crashed my car fix it."" followed by ""Oh you did good here's my uncles car, fix it too.""
5. Improve the handling or get rid of it the track. It's kind of pointless in it's current state.

The game has a lot more potential.. after this 3rd release, please do more than make it shinier and clickier.",1657740329,1657758443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a professional mechanic for 6 years and a lifetime automotive enthusiast, I can say this game fully satisfies those interests. It takes all the aspects that I loved about being a mechanic and leaves out things I hated, while also adding in all the things I love about cars as a hobby. The cars and parts are detailed and accurate, but also simplified so as not to become totally unmanageable. The visuals are beautiful, and it's so rewarding to see the results of an old rust bucket being fully restored. 

I would say I'm 100% the target audience for a game like this, but I think a lot of people who wouldn't expect to like a game like this would actually find enjoyment out of it, and you don't need any prior automotive experience or education. The process is intuitive and systematic enough that anyone would be able to do the work / play the game. For those with no background knowledge, I think this would be a fun way to become familiar with how cars are put together.

To the team: 

Thank you very much for your efforts putting together such a great game!

That said, it's not without faults. It's not perfect. But no game is, and they've done such an awesome job on this it deserves the accolades I gave it. The fact that there's room to improve it just makes me excited for the future - upcoming DLCs and past that, the next versions.

The whole game is fantastic but I really have to give credit to the driving physics. I've read some other reviewers say they're not up-to-par but my opinion is that they're just perfect. I've been playing racing simulators since NASCAR Racing 2 all the way up to iRacing, and no, they're not iRacing-level realistic or detailed, but that's expected since the main focus is on building the cars, not driving them.

That said, the physics are still really good. They hit a perfect balance between difficult-realism and arcade-fun. I do laps and laps on the racetrack in my creations just for fun. One thing that is sorely missing is the ability to watch & save replays.

There are many things missing actually, but like I said, it just makes me excited for the future. The game as it stands is AAA.",1657410650,1657410650,True,1,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False

In real life I'm no mechanic, but I can replace a few parts and drain and change most of the fluids. I bought all the DLC and the game during this summer sale, I'll update this review as I play more and get used to the game:

[hr][/hr]

[b] 1 hour: [/b] I pop a car hood and everything is pretty easy to see at a glance. No tubing or wires blocking the view. The starting vehicles also seem to be very roomy under the hood, so you don't hassle with mis-clicks too often.

[hr][/hr]

[b] 7 hours: [/b] Mostly fixing suspension systems and brakes. Fixing up cars is fun and I'm excited to get back onto it to see how the other stuff is built.

[hr][/hr]

[b] 12 hours: [/b] [spoiler] Transmission and engine work is tossed into the mix on top of suspension and brakes. It's still fun but some parts of the gameplay begin to feel a tad tedious. The design of some cars internals are terribly laid out. It's probably accurate to the actual cars, but still a pain in the neck to work on. For example, having to remove large pipes to reach the oil cap is a design I never thought I'd see, and I hate it. Some cars also have the radiator/cooler so tightly against the engine that it becomes difficult to take off timing belts and pulleys. I have upgraded Bolt removal to Max level. [/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[b] 19 hours: [/b] [spoiler] Bought paint shop and a bunch of other stuff for a job that I couldn't finish for the life of me. Here is a tip from my learning experience: If your car isn't coming up as ""Painted"" after painting it, make sure you have all the body parts attached (including all windows and Mirrors), and repaint it. [/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[b] 23 hours: [/b] [spoiler] I'm getting a tad sick of taking off tires for everything and have decided to mostly work on engines now. Game tip 2: Steering Rack below engine can be an engine problem (I can't escape the tires D:). Additionally, my annoyance with removing tires and their bolts has now transferred over to engine Valves and Rockers. I'm hoping leveling my examination time will make that process faster...

This game takes Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 and gives it a ""new coat of paint"" to say the least, it updates Unity to LTS 2021, this gives better performance, newer features, security updates and reliability. However, this does not account for the developers lack of creativity and inconsistencies, why would a mechanic garage be placed in the middle of a desert with vehicles driving by semi-regularly, why do we have a relatively modern and up to date workshop in what seems like the middle of nowhere.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 does so many things wrong it makes me regret buying this game. When you're running the game at high graphics you have a filter over the game that makes it feel cartoony and unpleasant, most vehicle content and part content is slapped from Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 into Car Mechanic Simulator 2021, they made no effort in redesigning the license plates from Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 and just added them to Car Mechanic Simulator 2021, some of the beneficial additions they've made would be liquids like coolants and hydraulic fluids, electrical boxes and a very basic form of EUC's, they've added the ability for cars to be missing parts of their suspension and even missing wheels, which Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 didn't have and sorely needed, this is a genuine improvement but what's not an improvement is the removal of the third car lift, the duplication of body and part repair stations, why do I need more than one body and part repair station? Why move the engine crane to a separate room rather than have it on the same floor as the vehicles you're working on?

Even though I find the Campaign a useless feature, you can somewhat easily make yourself bankrupt in the campaign, which makes it basically useless if you're not good at business/finance simulators.

The games UI/UX is so inconsistent it hurts, and the most glaring question of all, what are you supposed to do when you've repaired all the cars you can get your hands on? Start over again, buy more DLC? This game is even worse when it comes to repetition, because they haven't solved it, they just think feeding us more base vehicles, parts to replace/repair and more DLC will satisfy use, they don't seem to care about listening to the fans even though they probably would disagree with me, but as a fan I know none of my concerns have been heard nor even taken into account, and I know other fans haven't had their concerns or voices heard either.

This game shouldn't exist, the time gone into developing this should've been put into Car Mechanic Simulator 2018, they're only making year incremental games to rake in more money and screw over current fans and new fans, I'm getting sick of the quality of games PlayWay S.A. is making themselves and getting companies/developers to make and even worse, I would recommend Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 over Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 any day, not only for the great community content that we currently have, but also due to the amount of DLC (Downloadable content) at our finger tips at a relatively cheap price (Average $7 AUD), the fact the game doesn't bog you down with too many decisions and options.

TL;DR: Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 with a ""new coat of paint"", ignoring fans, inconsistencies, a few more QoL features and performance fixes and less DLC than Car Mechanic Simulator 2018, save your money, do not buy.",1654931918,1656827894,False,9,0,0.550931453704833984,0,True,False,False

Since this game came bundled with another title I can now leave a better review of the game now that I have toured the new features and had some additional play time and I came away with this: Save your money.  

This game is not revolutionary compared to 2018 if anything its a light refresher, some graphical enhancements and few mini games added and the overall shop layout has been spread out but that about all there is.  All the same cars from the previous games, all the same DLC's for the most part and basically the same interface.

While I think its cool that the developers have streamlined this title with each new iteration, I don't feel like there is enough innovation to warrant the asking price, especially with all the same DLC's that must be bought all over again when they could have just been included.

There is still no interior customization beyond changing out seats and steering wheels.  There really isn't much customization period.  If you take away the performance parts that are mostly engine related, you're left with brakes and that's it.  Can't lower or jack up your rides, no lift kits, dash kits, body kits, etc.   I get bored easily and I find the core mechanic aspect to be very tedious and can get really boring as its literally one job after the next.  I used to really enjoy buying junkers to fix up and sell but most vehicles have very generic drivetrain's and as previously mentioned the only really wow factors are modded engine parts and brakes.  Paint and Livery is the same as previous installments.

So to sum it up, the mini-games are meh, I don't like the spread out shops, the car washing feature is pretty lame.  You could just buy CMS2018 and be just as happy unless you need to have every version.  Granted the game has improved substantially since it debuted in 2014 but the pace of game improvements slowed right down after CMS 2018 which makes CMS 2021 a poor value.",1629330556,1656619577,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can trim, paint, choose different body parts etc to make the car as you like it. You can also test drive the cars on a strip or a race track.

It's not as attentive to detail as promised, there are a number of fiddly annoying bits and pieces any real car enthusiast would routinely spend time cursing out as part of their work, yet this title seems to have overlooked it.

I don't get why they have copies of cars alongside paid DLC for licensed vehicles, that seems really an odd design... NFS  back in the 1990s had no such issue and you had the full gamut of licensed cars to choose from.

I do recommend it, but it's a specific niche this one...

Realizing I don't have the money to actually finish any of the contracts I've accepted, I start being even more selective on which ones to pick: Simple, Predictable, preferably with pricy components I can actually cover and with a payout bonus. In the meantime have to sell a couple of those components I found at the scrapyard.
Finally I fix that car for over 4000 credits, just enough to not have to worry about money as much, finish another couple of jobs and then finally finish the first, totaled car.

I have been so hesitant about picking this up. I wasn't sure if it would be worth it since I have 2018. Well, it was very worth the purchase! The new, far more interactive tools like the wheel balancer, and repair bench, to name two things, make the game feel more involved and enjoyable! For the most part, its close to the same as 2018, but its one of those things where, instead of redoing the whole game, and risking ruining it, they took what worked well, and built off of it more. New locations like the junkyard, and car auction make the game VERY enjoyable as well! I love going to the junkyard, finding cool cars, and rebuilding them for (most of the time) profit. 

There are a couple things I didn't like. The workshop contains items that you need DLC for most of. The thing I liked about 2018 was the fact that people made mods that would replace DLC cars, and the modded cars would just use base game engines. I only purchased two DLC's because of that. 

I also wish you could do more with the cars after building them. I usually buy junkyard cars and rebuild them, but when I am done, that's just it. It's still satisfying, but I just wish there was more!

The game is a bit of a grind. but I don't mind. This game is so amazing to play while watching YouTube or a stream. So yeah! If you enjoyed CMS 2018, and are on the fence about this, I would do it, I mean, I did. It was very much so worth it to me! I also got it on sale for $20, which again, I found to be worth it. 

I do plan to buy DLC once I get bored of the base game, but I don't see that happening too soon!

I just want to say quick too, I see a lot of people saying this game is ""extremely realistic"" and such. It really is not, however, it is a great start to learning about cars and parts! And this is an extremely fun game to just sit relax and enjoy if you like cars! But it is far from being extremely realistic!

There are many new features to like, including the new auction system which has a much more friendly sound when bidding rather than the harsh sound of previous.

The game play is much smoother, has lots of new repair features, and i love the painting options compared to before. The immersion of the game feels a lot more like a mechanic game and therefore this definitely gets the thumbs up!

New features in this game over CMS 2018

Car wash
Much better paint options
Much larger and extended repair work (body work, brake lathe etc)
Missing part locator
Extended catalogue of much more parts
Many more cars
Overall very smooth gameplay and quick loading times

The following are some bits which in my humble opinion could or should be added in the next update, for ease / convenience and also immersion. 

1. Inventory vs warehouse. = There should be a ""transfer all"" button when you want to empty your inventory into the warehouse and vice versa. I accumulated a HUGE amount of parts and it took forever trying to transfer pages upon pages of parts into the warehouse. You can easily sell off all your items but I wanted only to keep a few in my inventory and clear the rest out, however this took ages and my fingers were killing me after 400 or so pages later.....

2. Personal space / office. = In CMS 2018 you had an office which had desks etc and then a rest area upstairs. This game has neither as far as I can tell. There is a section next to the warehouse on the right with a door that says ""push"" but I cant access it.

3. Perhaps the biggest gripe and need for improvement is down to the handling of the cars, ESPECIALLY once you have managed to upgrade the power. With some cars, no matter how little the gains, the handling is all over the place, the car becomes un-driveable and therefore you cannot enjoy the experience. Not only does this take away the little bit of realism but it also kills any fun you were expecting. No matter what you do, put on slicks, better brakes etc you just cant get the power down without sliding all over the place.

Thats all I can think of at the minute. The above 2 items by no means take anything away from the game. Just something I would like to see in the game to complete the experience.

Overall worth buying if you like tinkering with cars!",1653786964,1655488921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

cons - these are minor gripes - you don't really get to deal with any of the electical wiring or any tubing for air filters or even any of the pipes for stuff like the power steering to power steering pump or bake pipes from the brake salve to caliper. these would have been nice little touches. 
anouther issue for me and its the main issue is the engine of a car turning of when you exit the vehicle. 
more ramps would have been nice if nothing else woulda been better if there was 3 ramps/lifts to match the external parking space

Another big gain would be to have a certain goal in the game to achieve a certain wealth to be able to buy another garage for instance.
