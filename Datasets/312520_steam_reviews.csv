the thing is, though, that why animals tend to be like that, is because as far as they know, everything could be deadly. and guess what? in rainworld, it's like this too. and you'll enjoy it, because even though you're pretty weak, you'll figure out stuff on your own and learn how to live (mostly through trial and error).",1709043934,1709043934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played this game for 120 hours before I was able to barf up this review. Yet again, I wish steam had a neutral review option. Will you like this game? I genuinely don't know. 
 
To summarize, Rain World is a game you will (probably) hate while you play, but love in hindsight. Rain World is the dark chocolate of games. Either you think it's bitter and gross, or you admire it for some unique sensation, through a deep understanding of an abstract concept that may or may not tangibly exist. 

And to get into detail...

First, Rain World is hard. Like really hard. You'd have more fun playing dark souls drunk than this game. This game will throw bullsh*t at you and laugh while it watches you die, and then mock you for fun when you respawn in your shelter for the 400th time. For any casual player, the gameplay of Rain World is abysmal. You will not like it, and I genuinely do not suggest you get it if you aren't willing to dedicate hours upon hours to this game with little progress. While this helplessness is arguably a core component of the player being just another middle-of-the-food-chain animal in their broken ecosystem, it's not fun for the average Joe, and this is a fact that any seasoned player should reasonably agree with.

Secondly, if you like a narrative that leads you on, you don't get that either. I praise the story later in this review, but if you are coming into this looking for a story to be told, you won't actually get one. You have to [i]find[/i] the story on your own by just happening along the right path - a path which tries especially hard to make you turn back with its absurd difficulty, and which the game provides no indication towards whatsoever. For some campaigns, the circumstances you have to satisfy to get the full and complete story are so specific that any other game would reserve those steps for an easter egg or secret bonus. In Rain World, that's just how the world works, that is the norm. You'd better have damn good intuition if you wanna get this done fully.

So onto the positive.

Rain world is (or at least, feels like) a technical marvel; it is the dream every aspiring new dev hopes to achieve, complexity made from simple and elegant parts. The amount of image based graphics in this game for characters is tiny, with most objects being composed out of primitive, rigid parts and shapes. The AI follow a simple set of archaic rules much like a simple animal in the real world would. It's hard to describe this game's artstyle and presentation. If you were around on the internet and did gaming in the early 2000s, do you remember when a popular artstyle of game menus or flash animations/art were made out of really cool mechanisms and machines? Rain World is just the embodiment of that artstyle as a professionally designed game. If you like micro-mechanisms dotting every part of the world, this [i]is[/i] that vibe. If you like abandoned infrastructure, this game is that vibe.

The storyline of Rain World is also super enticing, unlike any other I have seen in a game. The world is abandoned, but not for some mysterious reason. The reason is very well known, well documented, and very directly intentional. There is no mystery to why the world is as it is, yet somehow, there is something presented in this story much more interesting than any ""the world was abandoned"" mystery could ever hope to achieve. The story of this game is by far one of my favorites of all time, and for good reason. The way certain characters are depicted, the way they are developed, the way their motives are so unique and flavorful. I can't help but to empathize with each in their on distinct, special way. This game tells a wonderful story of a fascinating tragedy that you will never forget. ...If you can find it.

All around, I don't know what to think of this game. I like it. I like it enough to have contributed significantly to its modding community (even to the point of having my mod code recognized officially). But it's just so hostile to new players that I don't know if I would recommend it to someone looking to play. It's more of an ""eh"". By all means, try it if you are feeling up to it, you could like it a lot. But go in expecting a bit of a shock of bitter taste that you may or may not get used to.

Through and through I will ultimately give this game a +1, on a 51% yes to 49% no type ratio though. It's a hard decision to make.",1708881915,1708881915,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To that end, you need to orient yourself in a foreign ecosystem and survive whatever creatures live in the graveyard of a civilisation that used to rule the world. The screenshots speak for themselves, and is more or less what it says on the tin.

Why am I not recommending this game? There are a few issues, but I will address the biggest one first. The game is by design minimalistic and is intended to be enjoyed with minimum amount of prior information about how the game works or what it contains. This is actually the main reason why I decided to try this game. Exploring an ecosystem of an alien world with minimal guidance on what you are doing is, on its face, a genius video game concept.

There is a major issue that sets back the gameplay, though, and that is the issue of lives. Now, everyone who has played the game and is experienced in it will probably scratch their head. ""Lives? There are no lives in the game, what are you talking about?"" I will get to that in a moment.

The game is gruellingly difficult, which is fair, but if you have lives to contend with, this makes the game largely not fun to play. Whenever you die and you have not eaten a sufficient amount of food, you will lose a life. You will replenish a life if you eat a sufficient amount of food and go back to a safehouse to hibernate for the cycle (when the world floods). Cycles are very short. You have to go out of your safehouse, avoid dangerous predators who are plentiful, eat food, and then try to explore the next section of the world in search of a new safehouse that gets you closer towards whatever gets you out of the hellhole. This is annoying and obnoxious, and a few hours into the game I just called it quits as I was getting cornered in the same few spots over and over again, trying to conserve my lives.

Now, as I made clear, this is not actually how the game works. The game is minimalistic, and the very minimal tutorial at the beginning of the game does not explain that the karma system, which is what I described, is not actually a lives system. This very prominently-shown feature that flashes in your face at full screen whenever you die or hibernate is, in fact... for opening doors. That's it. It serves no other purpose. I found this out only when looking up the wiki.

Why did I think this is how it worked? There's every reason to think this:
[list]
    [*] The game is very difficult. It is tagged on Steam as ""Difficult."" One of the characters that you can play as in the game will permanently die if he dies even once.
    [*] Slugcats hibernate. What happens if a creature hibernates without sufficient food? They starve to death. This is a game of survival. The game is tagged as ""Survival"" on Steam.
    [*] It is extremely prominently featured whenever you die, and looks ominous.
[/list]

It would be both illogical and irrational to assume that if the counter goes to zero and you die, you don't permanently die. Yet it turns out that it is a completely minor feature that has zero impact until you hit a door, which requires you to have a certain amount of karma to open. I already knew it opened doors, but I assumed it was one of many secondary functions of this supposed lives system.

I was punished by the game for coming to a perfectly logical and rational conclusion, making my own experience with the game significantly worse. Once I realised this by looking up information on the wiki, I had zero desire to ever play the game again. This type of minimalistic game only makes sense if you don't trick your players for following common sense. This is why I don't recommend the game. If I knew the karma system was not a lives system, I would have just played the game the way you are supposed to: die a lot and experiment.

Other issues, although they weren't a complete dealbreaker for me, pertain to controls. The game uses, if you will, an alien control scheme that is unlike any other platformer. It is very clunky. I would have preferred if crouching was just a toggle like in other games, but instead it's the very finger-twisting up and down movement keys that toggle it. Never understood what the point of it was. Sometimes grabbing onto ledges and other parkour actions do not work as expected. I kind of started to get a feel for it before I quit playing, but it never felt right.

Lastly, the predator variety is kind of middling as soon as you finish the first section of the game, although I guess if I wasn't tricked into playing cautiously and embraced an aggressive approach, I would have gone through the world sections significantly faster. Still, there's a lot of predatory lizards and not enough of other creatures.

All in all, impressive game, but I do not like being tricked into playing the game wrong for applying sound reasoning and logic.",1708795345,1708847610,False,0,0,0,8,True,False,False

Never mind. I finally did it and I feel amazing.

In all seriousness though. This is not a game about progressing and becoming stronger. This game is brutal.
You are at the bottom of the food chain. The only thing lower than you are small bugs and mice. And it stays that way the whole game. Even as it gets harder and harder you stay the same. Instead you have to use knowledge through experimentation, success or failure and cunning and luck.
You can kill things higher up the food chain with these things. Or go through a pipe straight into open jaws because this game can be as fair as life itself. So patience is also a good thing to have playing this. Try to experience it and it's ecosystem, learn the feel of movement (because it is unusual and complex), not rush to reach the end. It's a survival game, not a beat each level game.
And I love it. Such a breath of fresh air. Really unique. But even in saying that. It's not for everyone.

pretty solid game tbh, decided to rewrite this review just to say it's good. i like the game, i don't play it as much as i used to but it's damn good if you like platforming and just trying to survive while everything tries to kill you lmao

If I were to describe its genre I guess I'd call it a survival platformer set in a long-abandoned, sort-of sci-fi world (that's my best attempt at it anyways)? But not survival like the many survival games with crafting and stuff that exist, it's survival in the sense that you're an animal pretty low on the food chain that's just trying not to get eaten while scrounging up enough food to hibernate before the rain comes again. I don't think a specific kind of genre really fits it fully anyways, as its game play is genuinely something I don't know if I've seen before.

Admittedly, that game play is something I think will alienate a lot of people if they go into the game completely blind. You're told pretty much nothing except the basic controls for movement (and oh God can the movement get complex) and picking up and throwing objects, the game expects you to experiment a bunch to figure out how things work yourself, which while it can be fun I also know a lot of people don't really like that level of vagueness. The game also *tries* to guide players on a specific route, but I really don't think the way the game does it does a good job at that, nevermind if a player can even figure out what's trying to guide them. I have seen several instances of people not knowing where they're supposed to be going or what they're supposed to be doing, and I have seen them wander into regions they really are not prepared for, and its something that happened to me at first too. 

Despite that though, I do think Rain World is a game people should not give up on as that vagueness can offer a very special kind of gaming experience when you figure out what x item does or just generally exploring the world. The game is also just fun in my opinion even when you know what everything does, and there are additional challenges within the game and community to complete, as well as lore to discover and theorize on (trust me, the lore is vague as fuck so theories are going to need to fill the gaps where information doesn't).

I would give you some reasons not to buy rain world, it is pretty challenging, but if you're looking at it on the steam page just get it. The learning curve might be steep but slug cat has a long way to go too and the difficulty only adds to the atmosphere the game creates. I waited for almost two years before I bought this game because I thought it looked a little silly at first but I have never been more satisfied with a game. It is such an incredible game with a stunning story line and it easily accomplishes some of the best atmosphere in any game I have ever played.

Your experience starts by being totally lost and helpless in a strange ecosystem. While traversing amazing regions, you will learn to counter your enemies and to differ between friend and foe. Every campaign is unique and will let you view the world differently, revealing the lore step by step. Patience and endurance are both traits you will need if accepting the challenge of trying to get through this.

This game is brutal-it's so goddamn unforgiving that scratching out your corneas with a hot, piercing needle would be less painful and in fact probably very pleasant. But this game is meant to be an immersive simulator, not a traditional game like most. I remember first playing this game and setting it down for months, unable to progress past Industrial Complex, but then the game started growing on me. Slowly, over months of spotted progress, I'd finally beat the game. After witnessing the ending, I knew this game was something special. There's so much beauty. Everywhere. Every single room of this game is breathtaking (besides filtration system) and the combat always keeps you on your toes. Dominating the ecosystem is something more rewarding than earning a diploma or having a family. 

Hopefully my beautiful use of yappanese is enough to explain my sheer love for this game. The game is brutal, but please, for the love of God, BUY IT. Even if you don't like it, just swallow the pill and trudge through it. The sheer gorgeousness in some rooms alone are more than worth it.

Imagine Sisyphus trying to roll the damned boulder up a hill. He keeps getting really close but the rock just rolls right back down. Now imagine that the boulder is your progress, and your - the player - are Sisyphus. 

This is a very roundabout way of pretty much saying that the game is  i n c r e d i b l y  d i f f i c u l t. 

It does however have a lot going for it, the main feature being its ecosystem simulation which creates very interesting gameplay that can vary greatly from attempt to attempt. The game also has a very in depth movement system and a highly exploration based gameplay loop.

The learning curve on the game is very steep as only the most basic of mechanics are taught to you and the rest are expected to be learned through tooltips or just through your own experimentation. 

The story of the game is excellent however it takes a while to understand it and find out the full lore of the game. 


Overall the game is best suited for those that can deal with a challenge and enjoy highly exploration based gameplay.",1707071870,1708479859,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Unfair enemy spawns and seemingly random behavior that makes no sense

Survival is simple; get food, sleep, don't die in the process. But the combat and movement of Rain World is deep and complex, having countless numbers of tech and nuance to it. Not all of it is told to you directly, but it is taught through experimentation with your surroundings and during moments of strife(or the 100+ page movement guide lol). The world is vast and complex, having many branching paths and connections, as well as many places to get lost. Combine this with its strange wildlife and you got the equivalent of an interactive alien ant farm. Every prominent area has unique identifying geometry and creatures, ensuring that exploration never gets old. The soundtrack is inviting and serves as an important game mechanic at times, adding to the intensity of encounters with layering and the mystique of discovering new areas. Progression is abnormal, as there is little to no permanent upgrades. This is a game with a heavy focus on skill and self-improvement as opposed to the average metroidvania that gradually makes you a demigod. The more you play this game, the better you will become.

The free Remix update also adds an abundance of toggle-able quality-of-life changes(visibility, hud settings, difficulty) to tailor your playthrough to your liking. Improvements such as uncapped framerates and fixes to common crashes add even more polish to this already slick game. [b]They even added helpful tutorial messages during gameplay with visuals to help relay useful hints. It's an amazing boon for new players![/b] There's even more that gets added if you get the Downpour DLC along with the base-game(practically becomes a sequel with double the base game's content, extra gamemodes, etc...), but it's not necessary if you're simply looking to play through once and be done(highly recommended if you find yourself wanting more).

It has beautiful art, amazing AI, and leaves a lot of questions about what this world really is. Despite this, I have noticed one very fatal flaw in this game. I'm a skill issue. I mean, it can pretty much be summarized that way. You can die in a LOT of B.S ways in this game, and by that, I don't mean to say ""oh I'm just bad"". See, you're pretty much living in an ecosystem. You're near the bottom of the food chain and you gotta survive. Wanna know something funny about nature? it's unfair. It's dangerous, and not something you can play around in. In that sense, this game is AMAZING at resembling an actual ecosystem, but it also leads to a *lot* of frustrating deaths that you couldn't really do much about. You require a lot of luck in this game, probably more so then you do actual skill. You can be the best player, but with bad enough luck, you could die. You could be really bad at avoiding the enemies and surviving, but with enough good luck, you don't even come close to death. Again, call me a skill issue, because that's fair enough, but this game has an incredibly high skill ceiling, and if you're not starting off skilled at games, you will probably have a very frustrating time throughout many parts of this game. Though, it's worth mentioning I came into this game with an idea that doesn't fit what the game actually is, and while the product I received didn't make me hate the game, I can't say just yet if it was worth the purchase. I compare the games difficulty to getting over it, personally. (For background knowledge, I have played that game as well)",1708263961,1708360028,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me preface this by saying this game is not for everyone. It's for a niche. If you are not a part of that niche, this game is disappointing. If you are a part of it, this is a very unique masterpiece of a game.

The gameplay is relatively straightforward. You wake up, eat food, try not to become food, find shelter, sleep, repeat. This sounds boring, but it isn't. If you don't know how to progress, just pull up the map and you can see where you haven't been yet, and go there. That's basically it. That's the gameplay. Repeat that until you find the end and you're done. There are no bossfights, no quests, no upgrades, nothing. That's it.

However, this game is still a masterpiece. A part of the fun of the game lies in trying to decipher all the characteristics and quirks of each and every plant and creature you see, all the while trying to stay alive.
That's the fun of the game: seeing every creature interact with the world. Every creature has predators, prey, weaknesses and abilities. There is an entire ecosystem in this game, with an entire food chain and fight-or-flight response built into every creature.

Every time you enter a room, there is a chance you get ambushed by a gang of lizards, but also a chance the entire room is devoid of life. All rooms in an area are active (creatures can move and act in them without interaction). This means you can enter a room and see a group of lizards fight one another.

Lizards for example, try to hunt you, but will fight other lizards over food and territory, but will run away when something higher up in the food chain arrives. There is even a reputation system built into these things. Even within the same species of lizards (yes, there are multiple species with different abilities and AI), there can be different personalities of lizards.

What also helps with this is the animation: nothing is rigid. Everything is fluid and dynamic, because every single animation is procedural: done by code. This really adds onto the feeling of a breathing world, but can also sometimes have some weird quirks (sometimes lizards just spin around eternally or have an epileptic attack for no reason).

All of this makes it immensely entertaining to just discover the AI of each creature. I beat the game, and have genuinely have a 101 page document with the behaviour and weaknesses I discovered of each creature I met (granted 79 of those pages are just screenshots I thought could be lore). I have spent a lot of time just lurking in a tunnel, trying to see what the new lizard does, or just see a creature hunt something you thought was higher up in the food chain.

The only thing that I despise about this game is a compliment to the developers: they managed to make me feel icky with so many creatures. The absolute horror I felt after trying to grab a pole only for it to be a mimic and suck me in, is insane. Hollow Knight deepnest is a Teletubbies episode compared to this game's ick. The animation and AI on some of these abominations is immaculately disgusting and I love it. (Take this entire paragraph with a grain of salt though, as I am not the bravest. At least 20% of the times I exited the game was because I felt too icky to touch my keyboard after having slimy amalgamations kill me)

Some people say this game is too hard, but that's not true in my opinion. Sure, you will die a lot, sometimes it will feel slightly unfair (like when a lizard dropkicks you and eats you), but every time you learn (except for the dropkicking lizard scenarios. Scenario is plural because it happened twice). The only time I thought the game was unfair was when the only way out of a room had multiple enemies, which only happened rarely.

IMO a good game, very much definitely worth the price.",1706456305,1708347974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the absolute best storytelling, AI, and art. just play it trust me

Rain World is the best dying simulator in the gaming industry. you are a Slugcat in a mysterious world after being separated from your family. your lost, confused, and hungry. you look for food and then find shelter, only to be greeted by fierce predators. it is your fate weather you survive or not.

The ecosystem and AI in Rain World is the smartest AI in any game, its like a real ecosystem playing out right in front of you. predators hunting prey, prey running or hiding, then you. the creatures sometimes make mistakes. like bumping into walls, falling, or missing their attacks. thats what makes the AI feel so alive. they also fight each other over food, which is what you are. if you get caught by a predator and ""die"", not all hope is lost. theres a chance another hungry predator will come over and fight over you. giving you the chance to escape alive.

 The story in Rain World is very confusing yet interesting. the games way of telling you the lore is very subtle but nice. you know nothing at first but as you progress through the map, you start to see what might have happened to this dying, broken world. even i dont know even close to all the lore but after playing 3 campaigns (2 in the downpour DLC) its so cool seeing it connect and it just keeps you hooked.

The movement system is very versatile yet unimportant at times. there are COUNTLESS movement techs and tricks. sliding, flipping, rolling, etc. these 3 i just listed are in my opinion the most important tricks to know for your survival. but if you looked into it from what i know there are 80+ movement tricks. its bonkers.

THE ART is so god damn incredible, just gonna say that.

(editing a day after cause i forgot) The music, the OST, whatever you wanna call it. is indescribably good. It fits the tone of the world so perfectly, weather in danger or not, it always keeps you on your toes. if you you went on the playlist for the entire OST on youtube or something, i guarantee you would find good songs to listen to. The OST for the Downpour DLC is just as good if not better as well. im not good at explaining how good things are so just take my word for it.

so Rain World in my opinion is a must play for those who like platformer games or not. this is 100% the best platformer game out there. if you play Rain World and are stuck dying or getting lost, please dont give up and give this masterpiece a chance. its so worth it in the end and it will give you a great time if you pull through.
btw buy the Downpour DLC :)))))

ok this game is deserving of an edit to my review

genuinely if i had to pick a favorite game ever, slowly over the years i think rain world has eclipsed the others in my list. as much as i love terraria (and in fact, have put more hours in by over double) and risk of rain 2, and despite how I'll never love playing rain world as much as i used to, i think I'm comfortable saying its my favorite game ever. 

what i mean by ""never love playing it as much as i used to"" is.. well, quite simple, yet quite complicated. in basic terms, rain world is a FANTASTIC game to get yourself lost in. to suck at this game, to overcome hardships, to discover the world, the lore, and even the music... its indescribable. the fact that i'll never get to do all that over again is.. depressing, to me; which is why i don't have more hours on this game. I've found that I've gotten too good at the game, I've explored everything, done just about everything I can do.

regardless of all that, this game will always, ALWAYS have a special place in my heart, and I personally don't see anything else taking the number one spot, at least for a long time. this game truly is a masterpiece, and I always recommend it to people who love a good challenge in their games, love RICH lore and worldbuilding, and adore those silly little wawas. 

I still will continue to play rain world, and i encourage you to, as well. don't look up any guides- this game is best played without them, despite how difficult and directionless it may seem; because that's part of the experience. it's understandable to not have the time to throw yourself at a wall over and over, and i get that. my recommendation for that is to find someone who can watch your progress, and trickle down little hints to keep you going. if you're a person that likes some kind of direction in a game, i think that's the best compromise.


i think I've said everything i needed to. editing my review was mostly a spur of the moment thing, because i felt like this game deserved more from how much it's affected me lol.

Almost every time I've played a game like this, I get frustrated with it at the very beginning, put it down, and eventually digest what the game asks of me before returning to what will soon be one of my favorite digital experiences. It's a game that gives you very little direction, even though you know there's things to ""beat,"" or complete. However, these objectives simply exist, regardless of whether or not you want to engage with them, with no pressure or real guidance to completing them. In fact, the main hurdle to completing them is even knowing they exist and then knowing how to even begin. Rain World is probably the most egregiously one of Those Games than any other.

Nearly every ""objective"" is a brutal survival challenge filled with arbitrary skill tests and sudden road blocks and the only reward is understanding more of the world, and even just barely that. You are being led on a wild goose chase from the get-go, which you can try to follow or quickly abandon because you couldn't figure out how to get past that platforming room, or you got scared by a vulture or lizard forcing you to take a detour that leads you to entirely new areas to get lost in. You will get lost a lot. Even when you do figure something out, you might mess up and do something that angers powers out of your league that either requires a restart (although you will always keep your map between game files) or extensive procedures only vaguely hinted at to recoup. The game does not make itself trust worthy and you may very well decide to ignore the directions it sends you in, and you will still stumble upon what you need to do to complete the game eventually if you keep wandering.

Because the point of the game is to get lost. There is no other real objective. Sure, there are things you can do that will help you learn the world, but like almost all of Those Games, there is no reward but knowledge that may help you find even more understanding. However, at the end of the day, you're just a slugcat. A random creature in a world built around adaptation to unfortunate and ill-fitting circumstances. If you just want to beat games, and want to do so efficiently from the start in order to get on to the next game, Rain World is probably not for you. Funnily enough, if you are good at the game and know exactly where you are going, you could probably beat it in 5-7 hours, give or take some moments of getting stuck, but if you play the game blind, it would probably take you 15-30 hours to get to your first ending depending on how much you like to explore and learn about the world.

Unfortunately, this all hinges on a reward that no one can really tell you anything about outside of ""it's cool."" The only thing I or anyone can say about what makes this game great is ""trust me on this"" without spoiling what makes the game great. My only advice is to lean into the atmosphere of the game as much as possible: get into the headspace of being a tiny but intelligent little nimble rodent in a huge, hostile world. That and try to follow the little yellow guide when it shows you little flashbacks if you want to move towards the ending. Lastly, it's okay to put the game down and pick it back up again. If you need a second to wonder about it, to be frustrated with it, to be deeply confused, take a second and digest. The entirety of Rain World will sit there, indifferent. Try to return to it, however, because gosh what a world that is!",1685723742,1707925369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

8/10 (A-tier)
A brutal yet super unique and interesting experience.

[h1]Details[/h1]
[list]
[*]A large world inhabited by many creatures with unique behaviors. They also interact with each other (even when you're not close-by) instead of only caring about you. It creates the impression of a real ecosystem which you're simply a tiny part of
[*]The creatures and environments are very interesting and creative. Their AI is also mostly very good
[*]Besides an initial cutscene and a short introduction to the controls / basic mechanics you don't get much information. Rain World is mostly about exploring and figuring things out on your own
[*]The game is very unforgiving and it can be frustrating when you die repeatedly trying to get out of a dangerous area. However, it feels somewhat nice how the game doesn't pull any punches. Your life in this game is just as expendable as that of all the other creatures. It feels raw and brutal in a good way. And while dying sucks it also doesn't really have any drastic or permanent consequences
[*]The achievements provide neat side goals. A whole bunch of them even grant you ingame benefits
[*]Having to constantly escape the rain and avoid the numerous dangers of the game's world keeps you on your toes most of the time. When there's nothing going on the game can actually be quite calming though
[*]The sound design and music is good. While it's pretty quiet most of the time I think that fits the game well
[*]The controls feel a bit clunky and are unintuitive at first but there are actually many advanced tricks at your disposal. Once you get familiar with the game the movement can be very satisfying (except when you want to grab an item but the game keeps making you grab the corpse next to it instead...)
[*]The interactions with ""enemies"" are quite fun. Every encounter is a question of: What will it do and how should I proceed? Dodge, escape, fight or sneak around? You have to make quick decisions based on the room layout, available tools and the creature AI. It's gonna take a lot of deaths to get good at this though, especially because the AI is rather hard to predict. But at the same time that's also what keeps it interesting
[*]I like the graphics a lot but I was bewildered by the strangely limited resolution options in the settings. Luckily there is a mod called ""Sharpener"" you can install that lets you upscale the game. It also allows you to play in borderless windowed mode!
[*]Funky lore that is not thrown at your face
[*]There is a decently-sized modding community making very cool stuff
[*]The DLC is very good, lifting the game up to a 9/10 for me

It's fine if you find the game difficult and unfair, but do try to see it as a passion project, where you are supposed to be a little part of the ecosystem and not a big hero of the day.

(DLC is strongly recommended. It made the game 3 times bigger!!! Maybe even more if you include challenges and expeditions.)

You see unfathomable horrors, crawl through pipes, and encounter giant birds that very few creatures will even stick around to encounter.

It's brutally difficult at first, and a lot of people claim it's a failure sim. 

The biggest difference (from someone who hasn't even beaten the game yet) is all the small details in this game.
There's a ton of video essays and lore dumps in the wiki that tell you how complex the ecosystem is, and you can tell just by playing this game for a few hours. The world feels alive, exploration is heavily encouraged, and learning is just another death away.

I can't recommend this game enough for anyone who has the spare 20$ to spend on a game they're interested in.

Don't spoil it for yourself, enjoy the game as slowly and easily as you prefer. I may have a relatively short playtime with this game, but it's a blast to play, whether I'm surviving for a long time or dying every few minutes, I'm always learning something new and getting better with the game.

There is nothing like the feeling of getting good at this game, it is wonderfully well made and if you're willing to put in the time and enjoy platforming and survival games this is the game for you! If you dislike grinding, failing ALOT, quote on quote ""gitting gud"" as I saw someone put it, or being set back on progress enough where it just ruins the game for you, this is not the game for you.

Exploring the world is somewhat interesting. There is a bit of architecture, some gates that require you to be there on a specific day. Seeing the interactions of the other life forms makes the place feel (creepily) alive. But that's all there seems to be to it. 

Because the world is so opaque, there is a little helper-hologram(?) to show you along, giving you at least some hint on what to do next. If you need something like that in a game - man, it's way to unclear what you are supposed to do!

If you evade the predators, you can have a nice sleep and do the same exploring again. Or get eaten or get washed away in the rain... ... and do the exploring again.

I don't feel like this game is ""too hard"". Difficulty is a measure of how much you struggle between where you are and where you want to be. And in this game, I have no idea where I want to be.

but yeah anyways this game blew me away once i figured out what i was doing. it's often given as an example of an ecosystem simulator, and while i don't know that it's quite that, you do certainly feel like a prey animal. so many things are hazardous, the world is vast, and you feel disempowered in a way that makes achieving anything (a passage, progress in an area, killing a dangerous enemy, etc) feel very rewarding. the world itself is beautiful, and every area has its own neat risk/reward feedback loop. except shaded citadel. fuck shaded citadel. also the ending and another moment in the middle of the game gave me chills, can't remember the last time a video game did that to me even once.

there are some drawbacks though, like how hard it is to get into. it's easy to get lost, also the lore is unfortunately kinda sparse for how interesting it is and for what it has to say. the way a lot of information is disseminated (especially without playing through the dlc) is via small, easily missed items scattered across the map that have to be brought allll the way back to one room at the far end of the world, one at a time. and for reference, you get a few fast travels from gameplay that are one use each, but there are more pearls than there are passages. speaking of the game world's size, it's very easy to get lost. when following the intended route of the original three campaigns, npcs will guide you, but they can be flippant about what they guide you towards or not show up sometimes.

still a really good game. if you're curious give it a shot.",1706772175,1706772175,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A bit hard to get into at first, especially if you struggle with difficult games.  You will die.  A lot.  You will play the exact same section over and over and over again until you get lucky and slip past the enemies and make it to the next shelter.  This game doesn't do much to tell you where to go, it only teaches you the bare minimum for survival through the tutorial section, and then you're on your own, in a brutal unforgiving environment where everything thinks you are a tasty snack.

However! If you can tough it out, and keep going, its SO rewarding! The lore is incredibly deep, the story is fulfilling, the characters are adorable and each of their campaigns is unique and interesting.  The modding scene is starting to take off with this as well, and there are many new regions, slugcats, and more to experience, adding hours to your gameplay! It took me about 150 hours to complete all of the main campaigns before dipping my toes into mods, and I can see already that I've got a few hundred hours to go just with story mode alone, and thats not even delving into expedition mode and arena, where there are new challenges and objectives to complete.

10/10 this is hands down my top game of all time, taking the crown from Hollow Knight.

For those of you just getting into it, I have one piece of advice: follow the little eyeball dude that's always watching you, that's your guide! Beyond that, have fun!

If you see a shadow in the background that resembles a bird, run.

If you see a lizard or centipede that looks red, run and pray it didn't see you.

The game itself is very cool, it´ll take a while to get into the gameplay loop and you´ll probalbly get very frustrated cause you´re gonna die a bunch but that´s ok! 
Remember that it´s alright to not get everything done on your first playthrough (or any of the others unless you want to do that), thanks to the nature of the game it´ll be completely fine to just start a new save file without too much of a change, since you´ll still remember the things you´ve learned in your previous attemps.

Alright so time to write an actual review:
Writing this section I own Downpour and have completed majority of the campaigns available (excluding Monk and (spoiler)[spoiler]???[/spoiler])
I recommend this game and if you buy it I highly recommend you see it through to the end of at least one of the campaigns, whether that be Monk or Survivor.
Sure, the game is difficult and no doubt will be extremely difficult at first (unless you have some sort of natural talent) but it feels rewarding to finally make it through a difficult cycle and make progress.
While in my opinion the game is really good, I do still think it might be a bit expensive, priced at $36.50 AUD I think its a good idea to wait until it goes on sale (this is my opinion though); The DLC is a different story considering its cheaper than the main game and contains much more content",1685780489,1706456705,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere and art direction of this game is phenomenal. Every aspect is beautifully designed and thought out. The visuals are breathtaking, i will often find myself stopping to take in the environments while the incredible soundtrack plays in the background.  And the actual game-play elements are so well done and I enjoy every second of it.

The game can be quite challenging for new players, but that's by design. Getting to explore and learn how the world works for yourself alongside how to survive in this new environment is part of the experience, so please don't let it put you off from giving it a try.
If the difficulty really IS giving you a hard time, there's no shame in looking up guides, tutorials, or installing mods to make the experience more enjoyable for you.

And speaking of, the modding community for this community is great. The steam workshop integration means you can easily find a variety of mods to customise your game experience to your liking or spice things up a bit (not that the game doesn't already have a TON of replayability ). I myself play with a number of mods to to tune my experience to get the most personal enjoyment out of it. Although, I would still love and enjoy the game to pieces without them.
And speaking of the replayability, the AI for this game is incredible, it's everything it needs to be and more. I know it's been said to death but it absolutely does feel like you're a part of a living breathing ecosystem while playing the game, and I love it so much. A truly immersive ecosystem sim like this with creatures that feel alive is something I've always wanted in a game, and Rain World more than delivers.
This game also boasts deep lore with an interesting story and characters, if you're willing do dig a bit for it. Again, no shame in looking up stuff for yourself if you can't or don't want to try and figure out how to unlock all the story and lore bits for yourself. But it's definitely worth looking into either way.

The game features 3 campaigns to choose from in the base-game, and 8 (technically 9) in total with the DLC (which I HIGHLY recommend getting if you purchase Rain World, it more than doubles the amount of content in the game and is absolutely worth it.) meaning there are plenty of different ways you can play the game and so many hours of content. The intended way of playing the campaigns is by unlocking them, but if there's one you really don't like or one you want to do immediately you can use mods to unlock them all (though i highly recommend doing it the intended way).
There's also a lot of content to be found in the other game modes and Co-op.

TLDR; Rain World is an incredible experience worth trying out. It can be tough for new players but I highly recommend giving it a go anyways, and if it's too challenging you can always install mods or look up guides. The game is more than worth the money.",1706356747,1706356747,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

OKAY SO I LEARNED SOMETHING
MODS, RIGHT? YEAH GOOD THINGS VERY COOL :D
If you wanna play this game but you get spooked from the buggy bugs or spindly spidors...
GET THE MOD ""Get That Thing Away From Me"" or something along those lines.
GET IT.
IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETELY BAN CERTAIN BUGGIES FROM THE WORLD!!
IT GREATLY HELPS OUT, SHADED CITADEL IS GREAT NOW!!

Slugcat is very fun and nimble, but also very delicious to lizards, so beware.
Scavengers suck and I hate them, never befriend them they are horrible creatures, stab them on sight [but then youll have a killparty after you]
SHADED CITADEL SUCKS NEVER GO TO IT ITS NOT WORTH IT THE SPIDORS ARE SO JANKY AND HORRIBLE AND I HATE THEM NEVER GO TO SHADED
rot is mean
you do not get your hand held which is nice but also i spent my first 5 hours in outskirts
squidcada are nice but also mean i hate but love them
its fun to smack things with pebbles and then run
orange lizards suck, dont even taste good
if you get any mods get the nootnootfly so the noodleflies go noot noot and the rock bonk [and the yippee backflips please you will not regret that one]

Unlike most games that say they dont hold your hand, rain world really means it. To the point where this game has one of, if not THE coolest 2d platforming movesets ive seen, yet it doesnt even tell you the basic moves of it.

The world is also not designed for you. Theres paths that lead to nowhere, obvious routes that lead to areas you're way too inexperienced to clear, and enemies that roam freely, making navigation at times actually impossible
Oh, and its also hard as nuts. You'll die a lot, and for most of your first playthrough, plenty of those deaths will not really be your fault.
This game has so much traditionally bad game design that it SHOULD NOT work, yet its one of my all time favorite games.

The art and atmosphere is some of the best ive seen from a post-appocalyptic world.
The moveset is so varied and diverse, once you learn it you have tools for every situation
The enemies are absolutely exelent, and their ai is phenomenal, really making battles feel like a struggle between two (or more) creatures who just want to survive
The way the world is built up, while not traditionally amazing, makes for some of the most fun exploring ive had in a game
And the ammount of content and hours you get from this game rivals even hollow knight, especially with the downpour expansion

Despite its flaws, rain world is a true hidden gem. If you can overlook, or especially if you manage to embrace all its weird quirks, youre going to have an unforgettable experience.

The first 10 or so hours were hell and I didn't really care what was going on, I wandered around with aimlessly for god knows how long and ended up exactly where I didn't need to be. 

This game, visually, is beautiful. The environment has an ungodly amount of detail not just in appearance but contextually within the world. Appearance wise, the game's world aesthetic hits a similar part of my brain that the environments in Dr. Seuss books do. The music is relaxing and PERFECTLY captures the environments they're used in. That said, for me at the very least, it isn't enough to make my opinion of it positive alone, not even close. No amount of art, either visual or audible could ever be enough to break down the sheer amount of disdain I had for this game.

The game itself, initially, guides you to a place that you don't really need to be and its storytelling is vague to the point that it SOMEHOW blurs the line between having a story and not having one at all.

At least, that's how it felt at first.

After hours upon AGONISING hours of playing a game I almost certainly hated. A game, mind you that's set in a world fully out to tear you a new one in the same ways over and over and over and over and over again. 
You reach a point where finally you're finally able to properly question the world you're in. 

You keep going upwards into the sky, climbing higher and higher, and as you do things about the world that had, up until then just been, ""Accept it, its a fictional world with its own rules."", start to give clues towards making sense of the whole situation. 
""Why is the whole world bombarded with rain so heavy that you can get crushed to death just standing in it for a few seconds?"" 
""I don't know really, but the inside of this monolithic structure I've been climbing for the past 3 hours starts producing the ungodly amounts of lightning right before it starts to rain.""

Then of course, proper answers are given, DIRECTLY, and it becomes painfully clear that there's a reason you've been hating playing this game, the game doesn't like you OR hate you.
To the rest of the world you might as well not exist, the player gets NO preferential treatment in any way, you could literally not exist and the world of the game would continue on without you.

And that's exactly why it's so tough, you have to use what little you can find around the world to survive in the same way you'd have to if you were dumped in the wild. The game won't help you, and if you want to progress you'll have to constantly be proving that your survival hasn't been a fluke, that those who chase you with the intent to eat you will in their own way have to prove they can continue to survive by either having to contend with your choice of fight or flight.

Gameplay wise this works incredibly well... IN THE LONG RUN. At the start you're still learning how to move, in a way you're no different to a toddler, trying to survive in a brand new world while not having a good understanding of what's happening, all you know is that you want food and to not die. 
In a way this contributes to how empty the first hours of the game can feel. Though the game does have a guide pointing you in A direction to go and helping you learn how the world works their help is 'limited' to say the least and while I could talk about the story reasons for that, I'd be getting off track.

For the most part you're on your own, wandering aimlessly and without reason or motivation beyond your own fluctuating curiosity. Travel, sleep, repeat.

Somewhat shockingly, once you eventually claw your way to where you need to be the aimlessness ends, you learn exactly what you need to do and on the travel you'll have gained ALL the skills you need to accomplish your goal.

Upon reaching the final goal you WILL have questions the primary of which will most likely be ""What was any of that?""

And that's where the Rainworld experience truly begins. When you beat the first campaign, which, yes there are multiple stories, you'll have everything you need to start properly taking in the game from that point on. The first campaign doesn't tell much, it has a start and an end and everything in the middle is a really long roundabout journey.
The rest of the campaigns are a different story, they have much more direct story telling with some elements only making sense (clear sense mind you) because you've seen the differences from other points in time.

I LOVE this game, I love it for the truly strange, beautiful and outright depressing story that trickles in drop by agonising drop. I love the gameplay and the difficulty of said gameplay and how every victory is my own. I  love the environments and ecosystems and how the creatures that inhabit them make logical sense in the context of the world. I love the music and how each song effortlessly brings me back to the events that transpired around them (Seriously, if I allowed myself to, I could shed tears listening to ""digital sundown"", Speaking of which DO NOT EAT THE TINY FLOATING GLOWING WHITE THINGS YOU WILL GENUINELY REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I AM NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY JOKING IF YOU DO THEN DROWN YOURSELF). 

One last thing. A big part of this game is the dying and retrying. I really hated that for the longest time. Then I just stopped hating it. I know saying ""It's just part of the experience."" Isn't what people who are tired of it don't want to hear but it literally doesn't bother me at all anymore, and it's not a desensitisation thing either, it's just that death is such a big part of this game that it changes from the traditional ""Ow I'm being punished for being bad at the game"" or ""I can't believe this! I'm just an unlucky person and this game is unforgiving."" to ""Crap there's a lot of enemies that way and running through didn't work. Can I do anything about that this time or do I need to find another way around this?"". Treat death differently to usual because the game does too.

TLDR: Rainworld is hard. There are reasons for everything. You are not important in the world and it treats you as such. The game and story is guaranteed to be really fun from at least the end of the first campaign onwards. DO NOT EAT THE GOD DAMN FLOATING WHITE THINGS I CANNOT IMPRESS UPON YOU HOW MUCH YOU WILL AS A PERSON REGRET DOING THAT SERIOUSLY DO NOT SAVE IF YOU DO THEY DON'T MAKE THE GAME HARDER THEY JUST MAKE YOU SADDER.",1706293616,1706295007,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Sometimes I go out and put a couple Scugs in a box and drive him to the nearest Scug Adoption Center just to adopt these Little Sclug Dancers. Then drive them home and give them little mini tacos and mini cupcakes. (From my understanding Scugs are that they are about half the size of a normal human [Human: 5'9""{1.753m} M | 5'4""{1.624m} || Slugcat: 2'9""{0.88m} M | 2'7""{0.823m} F]). After our meal, we'll go out side on a walk through the neighborhood introducing them as my birth children to confuse people, and when they ask about the mother I'll get all defensive and start progressively getting louder  and start crying as I say, ""Don't talk about their mother; she was AN ANGEL WHO WAS STRIPPED AWAY FROM THE WORLD EARLY!! WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ME ABOUT HER!!!"". Then go home and teach them how to play video games while I register them in my family roster and prepare to enroll them in the nearby Elementary School (or my Grandmother's Pre-school). Then I'll sue the state to allow me to add them to my family roster and if I win, good, but if I lose then I will MAKE a school from them, their kind, and even humans (because I believe in equality amongst beings [except in the context of a joke]).

Many of the reviews say the game is grueling and difficult, but it depends on your perspective. This isn't a metroidvania, a soulslike, or even a survival game; your only objective is to be a funny slugcat. Anything else you want to do -- exploration, finding specific places or NPCs, or ""completing"" the game -- are up to you. Funny slugcat is fragile, hungry, and dies a lot. But funny slugcat can also be sneaky, acrobatic, and lethally creative. The joy of this game is in improving piloting slugcat, experiencing the ever-changing world, and seeing a lot of weird and interesting sights. With time, you'll learn to turn the tables on the predators that hunt you... or maybe you'll get good at slipping past them by the skin of your teeth.

Edit after completing some slugcat playthroughs: I absolutely adore this game. Everything about it feels so right to me it clicks so well. While the game does frustrate me at times, it is wonderful. The world is so amazing, the creatures are so interesting, and the stories of the slugcats/ the overall world really hits me. I have currently finished the main endings for half the scugs and i just can't stop thinking about them. The art style is so great and when the music plays it reminds me to take in the world. The ai is extremely interactive and it really feels like you exist in an environment of living beings. It never stops being hair raising either, trying to make it to the next shelter before seeing the shadow of a vulture always makes me sprint to the safest spot. There are moments in this game that leave me in awe. There are moments where I can't help but laugh when a lizard bites me and as its carrying me to its den a vulture snatches it and flies away with both of us. There are moments in this game that scare me to death but making it out feels like the most rewarding thing out there.

Soooo interesting and imaginative once you begin to piece together the clues(and maybe read some things online). gameplay is very immersive especially with headphones. The soundtrack and ambiance is amazing. Gameplay can be demoralizing and discouraging and may be taken best in small doses but once you learn that half the game is hiding and watching and learning and dying and learning more before you die again, its okay to die a lot, you're supposed to be vulnerable, its kind of fun to get eaten, it gets the blood pumping anyway. The whole beginning feels less anxious once you learn to play more on the side of curiosity than caution, you can expect to always find more new things and discover stuff but its a losing battle to stress over staying alive all the time, especially in the beginning areas.

The game is quite unforgiving, I will say, but the amount of mods and Remix options available can make the game to your liking, whether it's just quality-of-life or things that better suit your playstyle. Sadly, co-op is paywalled behind DLC and local only (unless you use steam remote play), but is fun when connection is good enough. 
If you have a low frustration tolerance, or aren't into the ""survival"" aspect, I would not recommend this game to you. However, if you like platformers, survival-type games, navigating mazes, exploring environments, learning as you go, and unforgiving difficulty, this may be up your alley.",1706088252,1706088252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a blast with this game for about 20 hours. The most fun part of this experience is learning what you can do and practicing it. Exploring the first 8 or so zones of the game is also great. 

The bad part is when you start progressing into the late-game. The game is challenging and feeling like the underdog out thinking and out performing the AI and environment is super rewarding. But when you get to the leg the rest of the game is locked behind climbs where you will die at the same place more than 50 times. Too make it worse the game sends you there a second time after youve already got past it with sheer luck the first time. This ruins the whole experience since ive been stuck on this part for more than 16 hours total and i now quit the game and will not recommend it. Its so heart breaking to have a great experience like this ruined by bad level-design that is not consistent with the rest of the game. please fix the white lizard climb in the leg so i can recommend the game. This is the only awful part of the game. Except some of the movement quirks/bugs. 

If you want to love something then get extremely disappointed to the point of heart break this is the game for you.

EDIT: Finished the game. Feel the same way about it. Wish there was more to it. The expansion adds alot of stuff but i cant speak for that. I was missing small things throughout this massive living world. I saw these orange glowing food fungus that was growing close to green what looked like grass. So i figured maybe you could grow more by placing some of that fungus on the grass but nothing happened. Just something i wish was in the game.

Rain world has the most well crafted and in depth ecosystem i have ever seen in a video game, from the level design to the creatures that roam it, from the atmosphere and how insignificant you the player feel walking across this brutal and indifferent planet. Rain World is a masterclass on how to create worlds that feels immersive and alive.

Unfortunately all of that are locked behind a mountain of frustration and confusion that any player will have to overcome first.You the player arent given any instruction on on what to do or where to go, which wouldnt be a problem at all if you arent so brutally punished for your lack of understanding. It feels the game is making fun of you for being stupid while it itself doesnt give you much if any context on how the game operate,Rain World definitely breaks what you commonly expect from a video game and as much as i want to explore all its uniquely crafted world,the experience is just too frustrating and isnt rewarding enough for me.

As a videogame, Rain World falls very short and leave a lot to be desired.

Just beat the game. One of the best experiences of my life.
Also, if you're a new player, I highly recommend mapping out where you are gonna go because I initially went to the end game part of the game first which I couldn't  pass without an earlier part, and the overseer is pretty much useless and the rainworld map in the game is pretty hard to follow I recommend going on the wiki and mapping out where your going with the map on the other monitor.

A while ago, I made a review not recommending this game on the basis of its unfair difficulty and contradicting game design. That was when I had 28 hours in the game. At the time of writing, I now have 153. 
When I wrote my negative review, I was a weakling. A fool. A conglomeration of spite towards the unfair circumstances that this game would put you through. And had it not been for the semi-recent addition of the workshop, my review would've stayed that way, and my hours would've stayed at where they were. Thankfully, after tweaking the game's mechanics about a hundred times over utilizing about twenty different mods, I can safely say that I now enjoy this game and its features- while still retaining its difficult nature.
The sad fact was, I needed to get gud. As harsh of a game as it was, and how relatively low the skill ceiling was for some aspects of the combat system, by downloading workshop items that changed its most unfair features and enabling some of the ""remix"" options, it became a much easier game to learn and a much fairer experience to enjoy.
Now, instead of putting holes in my walls after losing 10+ minutes of progress to sheer luck, I can now put holes in my walls for me not being good enough to meet the challenge. 
I recommend this game with a catch: that people do the same as me and utilize the workshop in order to play it to the best extent and to enjoy what Rain World has to offer without the unnecessary impediments.
Oh, and FUCK the promo team, who have helped foster one of the CRINGIEST communities I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. They, the team, commissioned actual artists to promote their game by putting up several pictures of a main character in a catsuit, and then following up with some of the most god-awful vomit inducing furry bait that has turned a quaint, philosophically deep and niche game into ""OWO!!!! Me HAz Slugcatt~! Durrrrr durr durrrrrrrrr durrrrr!!!! Me am CUTE like main character animalll!!! durrrrrr!"" It's too bad I'm a nihilist, because if I weren't, I would pray to god for him to forever torture these fuck wits in the eternal oblivion of hellfire, so I don't get looked at weird when I recommend this game to other people.
I still will, anyway.

Chances are you'll hate this game. You'll hate it's movement, it's AI and pretty much everything else. But you should sleep on this feeling and give it some 10 hours and all of a sudden it turns into a 10/10 game and you love all those things you hated.

This game isn't a typical platformer. It isn't even a game made to be difficult. It is a mystery game, a detective of sorts. Your semi-permanent quest is to figure out what to do. And the answer to this question is so elusive you actually have no clue for pretty much the entirety of your first run. Honestly, it made me drop this game for a month. Because even Hollow Knight does give you some directions and this game seemingly gives none. It is only when I came back to complete it after this long break I figured out there were always clues. And the biggest clue you get is the experience of the past.

The first run you do is supposed to be really long. It is this way for a reason and you'll have to trust the devs and me on this one. Once you complete your first run you essentially learn all you need to experience the same thing again and see how much it changes. Before you do this, the game is about ""rain"" and after, it is about the ""world"". I'd say the experience you get is 5 hours of ""AAAAAAAHHH!!!"", 10 hours of ""does it work like this?"" and some 20 hours of ""Oh, I see now!"". That last part is so worth it.

The Downpour DLC has some nice additions to the base game that make it easier. Notable mentions are a few visual indicators for common things, random occasional hints and QoL tweaks. I wouldn't pick it up while you are still in ""AAAAAAAHHH!!!"" stage, but if you get over it the DLC will help you get through the ""does it work like this?"" faster. And of course it adds 5 new stories about new unique characters with various difficulty. Just make sure to not to look in ""Major Assists"" tab of Remix Options so that you don't spoil yourself anything. Those are mostly for some really hard things and it is honestly best to experience them as is before tweaking them to your liking.

The ""world"" is magnificent. The visuals, the music, the atmosphere... Solid 10/10. The lore is deep and almost consistent, 9/10. The gameplay is really good but with a few quirks you need to get used to, 9/10. All in all, this one is among the best games I've played but it may repel you at first. 10/10",1705710361,1705710361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This might also be the time where you encounter one of the many enemy's in the game.
All from lizards to giant mechanical vultures flying about looking for prey like you.
At this point, you may notice that this game is not forgiving. All the enemy spawns are random every time with a mind of its own. Every enemy think on their own and make their own strategy on how to survive. So you have to outsmart them by using movement, weapons and strategy.

For example, you can get taken by a lizard, and another lizard may attack the first one to steal the food (you). This gives an open window to run away while they are fighting. There are also apex predators like vultures, that wear masks. That if stolen, you can wear to scare off lizards. The game does this a lot, and there are just way too many creatures to bring up. You just have to explore and find out on your own by trial and error.

The story of rain world is probably one you must experience before you just search it up.
It's a really interesting story to say it at that. And is a big focus for a lot of people.

The only real problem I had while playing was the confusion on what to do next. It's not just me too, I've seen a lot of people saying the same thing at the start. I sadly had to search up where to go and used an online map to experience the game. I had a lot of fun playing the game like this, but it might not feel like you played the game as intended. There is a little creature that tells you where to go but it just takes me to some random direction and at the end if it I was all the way in some dark, claustrophobic, red, maze like tubes. And the way I took to get there was so hard at the time to get to that I just started over. Of course others may have a different experience, but this was my first time playing, and I went in blind to not spoil myself. So I had no clue on where to go.

All in all, I think this is one of if not the best games I've ever played. The gameplay unique fun and addicting almost as you want to go to the next shelter without being eaten or before it starts raining.

After getting completely tooled by maneuvering with Pebbles changing gravity on me last minute and refusing to provide warning prior to the moment of the shift as to when, dying this way somehow felt even worse than I had thought possible. My preparation was superior, my play was superior, and I died, so I don't see a reason to continue engaging in an activity where what is within my control is overwhelmingly outweighed by what is not. I am done with Five Pebbles, and you won't get a fond farewell.

Areas used to have an difficult yet balanced spirit at their heart, this has been transplanted and replaced with an artificial organism that feeds on my slugcat and the sanity leaking from my brain that can't take many more deaths without fatally wounding my ego. The game we enjoyed has trapped us all like this in a vicious cycle, and escaping it requires acceptance of the harshest reality we all scramble to explain away, that none of the countless straining efforts we put ourselves through here will ever amount to escaping the skill issue allegations.

If you're the type of person that likes suffering through the first 4 seasons of a show only for it to become tolerable later on, this may be for you, but I cannot state enough how disappointed I was with this game.

I'll get the positive things out of the way first. Rain world *does* have a very unique art style. A lot of the environments genuinely do look pleasing. The combination of industrial scrap and and alien wildlife is very pretty, and doesn't really compare to much else. However, the lack of antialiasing can make smooth or fluid things look jagged and pixelated, which is unpleasant.
All of the movement, both player and NPC, is physics based. While it can be very clunky and lead to frustrating deaths (more on that later) it is unique, and out side of the ""rage game"" niche -- which rain world arguably falls into -- is unseen in the industry. There's also a lot of movement tech that comes with basic player actions, but most of it is useless, not taught to the player, or both.
The creature AI is also fairly impressive for the most part. Enemies don't stay in place until they see the player, but wander around and look for food. They can get into fights with other creatures, can panic upon seeing the player, and sometimes flee if injured in combat. This does make interactions feel much more dynamic, but also largely unpredictable.

Now onto the negatives, which rain world has no shortage of. To start the map. The enviroment is similar to a metroidvania, extremely big and often loops back on itself. Despite all this space, most of it is useless, only containing enemies and rocks you can throw at them. No power-ups, no tools, no rewards except unlocking items in sandbox mode. Some paths actually lead you away from the game's linear progression, which obviously means getting lost is an inevitability. There is a map function, but despite the 2d geometry, the map is in 3d, with three different ""layers"" you can go between.  When exploring, there's no indication that this happens, until you check the map. This makes navigation exceedingly difficult, which can be frustrating when exploring, or at worst, outright lethal. This is because you have a time limit between saves, which if you exceed, you die. If you do not get back to a designated save point in time, rain will come and you will drown. This means general exploration is not only discouraged, but progress forward at times requires near flawless execution of difficult platforming and avoiding enemies. Even if you do complete this in time and make it to the next save point, food is a resource required to save. If you attempt to save without eating enough, not only will your game not be saved, but the food requirement for saving next time will be increased. Getting food is the only motivation to enter into the aforementioned ""side areas"", which are still largely optional, as food does spawn on the main path.
Of course, actually finding the way you're supposed to be heading is only a small part of the game. The platforming platforming is definitely part of it, and can feel frustrating when the movement is so clunky, but dealing with enemies can range from ""challenging"" to downright unfair. Enemy AI, as mentioned before, is complex and unpredictable, which makes fighting them even more challenging. Your only attacking option is to throw a maximum of two projectiles in a horizontal line. This can already be difficult to make work with how many walls and different vertical heights there are, but is only exacerbated by enemies erratic movements. For the most part, enemies can also tank far more damage than the player is capable of dealing, meaning players will have to find more objects to throw at their predator while they are being chased. Enemies can also play dead, and camp you out on the other side of doorways, which I shouldn't have to explain why either of those are frustrating. Even if you do manage to kill one, you aren't rewarded for it, unless playing on what's advertised by the game itself as the ""hardest"" difficulty. All of these issues are made ten times worse by the fact that every enemy in the game one-shots you. If you let them grab you, you *will* die. In my nearly thirty hours of playtime, I have not seen a single exception. This makes learning from your mistakes much harder, and while you could practice combat, in most scenarios its much easier to avoid them. This is the jump in the skill curve so large, its nearly vertical. Players get into the habit of avoiding enemies whenever possible, which can lead to frustrating deaths or roadblocks when one is in the way. Enemy location is largely random with a few exceptions, which to a player that hasn't practiced killing them (which is a behavior that is almost discouraged by the game itself) means that progress forward can feel like a matter of chance.
And of course, all of this challenge provides absolutely no reward. The story is paper thin and largely environmental, and the backgrounds are pretty but don't impact gameplay. The only thing you unlock through progression is more places to get killed. There is no satisfaction of a hard boss fight, no gauntlet you have to battle through, and a surprisingly low amount of platforming that is inherently difficult. So while subjective, satisfaction rarely comes into play. I found myself extremely disappointed when I managed to find my way forward, as I either wasn't sure if I was actually headed in the right direction, or I just happened to crawl through the right tunnel after hours of wandering. The ending, while abstract and beautiful, does not justify how long and arduous the steps to reach it were.

As much potential as it has, this is a game that is unfair, unfun, and unrewarding. If you are willing to sink hours into mastering it, you may be one of the few that develop sunk cost fallacy and manage to wrestle some enjoyment out of it, but for anyone with less commitment than that, I can't give it any more than a 2/10.",1670117860,1705604425,False,4,0,0.498280227184295654,1,True,False,False

After beating Survivor, I looked around at all the reviews, the lore videos, and even a few lets plays to try to understand why I felt drawn to the game despite it being a huge drag to play. I've seen many people call this game a failure simulator, an immersion sim, etc. Not a single one of them properly explained why they liked the game itself, despite knowing and talking about the huge amount of painful, cruel, repetition there is in it. It felt more like they were making excuses about the games bad points more than anything. 

I will not be holding back on spoilers regarding a majority of the games mechanics. I will leave the plot stuff to the side. But, if you are wondering, there is very little dialogue in this game. This game is more about the world than it is about specific character building. 

If you like torturing yourself, then you should absolutely play this game. With the DLC, there are 8 characters, each with somewhat different experiences and plot, many with different abilities and difficulty, most of which will torment you for probably hundreds of hours.
There is a lot this game does right. Beautiful backgrounds and colors, wonderful soundtrack that only plays rarely, which all help to immerse you in this cruel world, bizarre and interesting lore, a variety of enemies and monstrosities, different areas with their own maps, tons of little tricks you can learn by experimenting, and more! There is even a reputation system for all the creatures, you can befriend the or you can antagonize them. I heard if you try really hard, you can make an entire species run away from you at first sight. 
 
But onto my critique:
The fact is, the gameplay is not rewarding. 
Any complaints in this game are responded to with ""Skill Issue"", but I challenge that it isn't really about skill. It's about stubbornness. Knowing what threats will spawn where and how those threats behave, where to go in these huge sprawling maps that tie back into themselves (this is a big one) and knowing the hundred+ page google docs worth of movement skills that the game doesn't tell you are huge unfair advantages. You need to stubbornly repeat things over and over. But the problem is, that the core loop gets old quick, and then becomes a drag. 

Here is the basic gameplay loop:
You spend a huge amount of time repeating parts where there are no threats to get to the parts where there are threats, and the threats can all kill you in one hit. You can kill them (which yields you nothing but more enemies), hit them with a rock, avoid them, whatever it takes to get past them. Even then, they will chase you. You don't know where you are going, and you will waste a lot of effort going the wrong way, dying several times and repeating it from scratch, before realizing that you were going the wrong direction, and then having to do it all again. While you are traveling in the world, you can grab some food so you can actually save your progress if you find shelters. 
On an important note, there is a varying amount of time each life before the rain comes. And you need to be in a shelter before the rain comes.
The amount of shelters that let you save your progress are generally low, and if you end up going the wrong way you will have to backtrack through what you just did. Every time you rest, it is referred to as moving onto a new cycle. 

Every map has different combinations of enemies and threats that leads to you having to learn to handle something new, meaning that even though you are getting better, its offset by more dangerous/different enemies that you need to learn. 
The main problem is that they do not reward you with anything. You do not get stronger nor do you get any other abilities. This game is not a metroidvania, there are singularly correct answers as to where to go, and while on the Survivor Slugcat you can absolutely waste all your time and go anywhere you want to go, it gains you nothing to do so. 

Escaping the things that the fanbase would call ""Skill Issues"", I want to complain about Karma and the Hunter Slugcat.

Every time you gather enough food and sleep in a shelter, you gain a Karma, and every time you die, you lose a Karma. There are Flowers that allow you to avoid losing Karma on death once, which you will maybe see now and then. But on your first playthroughs, you will absolutely be at bottom karma from an excessive amount of dying. The starting range for Karma is 1-5.

Introducing Karma Gates: To go through one map to the next, you occasionally need to meet a requirement to even be allowed to move on. So, if after dying 30 times on one area, and you see a shelter behind a karma gate that requires a Karma of 4, you will need to spend your time feeding your slugcat, sleeping 3 times, and then doing that same run that you died on so many times already.
Karma Gates basically tell you ""Okay, you DID make it. Do it right this time though. Waste 30 minutes, and then make it to me without dying."" 
Which on Survivor is annoying but you can just grind your head infinitely until you complete the run. 
But on Hunter? You have 20 cycles to finish the whole game on Hunter. Even if you grind your head, you will game over and have to start from scratch. And for Hunter, there are no Karma saving flowers. If it were not for the Karma gates, you could theoretically speedrun huge chunks of the game by grinding your head at it (you have that timer I mentioned before about the rain), and 20 Cycles would be doable. But because of Karma, you will have to give up on run after run until you perfect it. 
Which is like the Karma gates, but on the scale of having to repeat the whole campaign. 

I suppose all this could also be considered a skill issue. But I do not consider most of those people skillful, just tryhards with a lot more time to kill than I do.

All this said, I liked the game. The lore videos slapped. The game has a charm to it. Still cannot recommend it.",1705452047,1705452047,False,97,29,0.591406047344207764,0,True,False,False

I went into this game expecting some Darkest Dungeon levels of RNG and difficulty, and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a lot easier--atleast in the earlier stages, than I expected. It is still quite a hard game especially if you're not used to the Live, Die, Learn, Repeat cycle that a lot of games seem to have embraced these days, and the game does rely on a lot of RNG, but I found that very little of it is blatantly unfair; given that Rain World is fundamentally a game about rolling with the punches the RNG never felt too insane either. 

Rain World is also just a lot of fun. The relatively tight platforming plus the emphasis on maneuverability and evasion against stronger enemies lead to a lot of fun moments of panic, thoughtfulness and split-second decisions, especially once you leave the starting areas and Rain World shows you what its truly capable of. I honestly can't put into words how cool it is to watch two animals fight while you try to sneak away and get food, or to see a ""Bird"" fly down and know that it will go after the biggest creature in the room (ie not you). The ecosystem of this game is really it's backbone.  

TL:DR Good game, buy if you're used to Live, Die, Learn, Repeat, not as difficult as advertised, RNG is (almost always) good and ok. Ecosystem and platforming is incredible and very cool. Lots of content

It is a incredibly fun platformer with survival elements in a living world that holds surprising depth to its game play. The AI is incredible and makes the world feel alive. It truly does create the sense this game is home to a living ecosystem. Every animal and living being in this game has their own life to live. They actively hunt, fight for territory, and explore regardless of whether you are there to see it or not. Some more intelligent creatures even remember how you treat them and communicate with you through body language and gestures that you might easily not notice your first play through. This all helps show you that you are not the center of the universe, you are just a part of it. In fact, rather than the hero that is here to save the day, you are near the bottom of food chain. This results in a lot of fun game play where you try to do everything in your power to stay alive while avoiding or fighting predators in a hostile environment and creates a lot of fun tension as you try to move through the world to advance the story. 

Rain World's difficulty helps communicate your low level on the food chain and reinforce its existential narrative focus and Buddhist pondering. Is life worth living when you are just one small piece of existence and it can be so difficult at times. If so, why? You're just a cute little slug cat that is just a part of nature trying to survive like everyone else. However, this doesn't mean you can't try to figure out what you need to truly flourish in life and achieve great accomplishments, or participate in things that transcend you. As you dig deeper and pay attention to your surroundings you will hear a very interesting story that essentially centers around the theme of Buddhism. It will be up to you how you respond to it and how much of the story you uncover and try to understand. 

However, if you like, you can just be clueless like any animal in our world likely is, survive, and bask in the amazement of the mysterious world around you. Rain World really does capture a feeling of awe and wonder very well at times and give you a feeling that there are much greater forces at play than yourself you can't even begin to understand. 

Overall, if you are up for a challenging but fun platformer where you play, in a complex, beautiful, and dynamic environment, a cute animal that is occasionally exposed to the philosophical ponderings of Buddhists, this is the game for you.",1705058642,1705058642,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After 1.5 hrs of playing I was even thinking about refunding, questioning myself if I even want to keep playing, but I stuck with it. I simply did not ""get"" the game yet.

You play as a small slugcat in a much bigger world and ecosystem. In this ecosystem you are nearly at the bottom of the food chain. The game is pretty unforgiving as you can often die in one hit or by falling into the void. Around every 10 minutes (it is slightly randomized) the downpour starts. The rain is so heavy and thick that it will crush or drown you. Until then you have to find a safe shelter and enough food to enter hibernation. This leads to a gameplay loop where you are looking for a shelter and food at nearly all times and when you forget about it you enter a panic state as you scramble to find something safe as the rain starts.

The game features not enemies and rather NPC-animals. They search for food to survive and may not be after you at all and may even be neutral. Occasionally you will find packs of lizards fighting or a feared enemy hiding from another more dangerous creature. All enemies act according to their senses. 
This is important: Learn how each animal ""sees""! Some may only react to fast movement or only hear sounds.

This way you slowly make your way through this world as you follow the small yellow overseer (Follow him, trust me. I kind of did not follow him and ended up in a sewer system that made my early 1.5 hours hell). 

At first the story may not be that clear and you don't know what it is about. It seems like you are just searching for your family, but it is much more than that. This only becomes really clear at the halfwaypoint of the game, but I won't spoil it now. Just let me tell you: This sequence was one of my favorite moments in video games in recent memory.

The world is set in the ruins of some ancient civilization, which went extinct. You will explore abandoned suburbs, overgrown factories, crumbling megastructures whose purpose you don't understand. It all is presented in an absolutely stunning way with gorgeous pixel art.

The music of the game is another absolute highlight. The calm tunes play fairly rarely and chime in randomly. The tracks greatly add to the atmosphere of this game's melancholic and lonely atmosphere, but also instills a sense of awe as you stumble through the ruins of a once great civilisation.

Rain World's main story (survivor) took me 15 hours to complete. The ending was confusing at first, but makes sense in hindsight. It's one of those endings where you think about the game for hours afterwards.

It is a game I can recommend to at least try out. Some may bounce off immediately and refund, but some of you may stick through with it and get used to the games platforming, its gameplayloop and most importantly: the frustration. Yes, the game often was really hard and frustrating, but I kept trying again and again and in the end I must say:

I think my issues with rainworld aren't really at the fault of the creators, but this game definitely isn't for everyone. I struggle when playing this game a lot, as one misclick of a key can send you flying off the edge of a cliff when you meant to grab onto a pole, and you then have to start over the cycle, sometimes very far from where you were. I often find myself very frustrated when playing and because of this i have to take frequent breaks. The game really doesnt give you any information about the world around you. In some ways I like that, and in others I hate it. I'm usually looking up the information that the game doesn't tell you. There is also only one save slot which I have issues with as i find myself stuck in certain areas sometimes and would like to be able to start a new game to practice new things i've learned.

Most of the time my reviews are made for the funnys with like 1 or 2 expesessions,but it would basiclly be a crime if i didn't write a review with meaning for rain world at this point.

Honestly i still don't know how i am goin to review this thing becasse it is honestly one of the most different video games you can find like,when you are reviewing a game you can at least say the genre like at least you can say that-Becasse if i had to tell some one the genre of rain world it would go some thing like this:""Rain world a survival,platformer,atmospheric, post-apocalytic (kinda),open world but not really,action,souls-like,metroidvania,survival horror (in some parts),exploration-""like no one cares about the genre-

Rain world is one of does games that you will hate at the start and slowy grow appreciation for,at the start the game will just throw you in  and bully you but that's what makes it special in my option.You aren't a hero,you aren't the main focous of the story,you aren't what the world and characters spin around ,you are just a creature at the botton of the food chain trying to survive as every thing else around you apart of the cycle that all living things suffer form.

Without goin in to ""da lore"" since that is a thing that makes the game special and if i said it i would complettly  ruin one of the best things about the video game,the envaroment story telling is just amizing if we count the DLC in to this review ,parts of the world will change depanding on what part of the time line that slugcat (character) takes place.This is like one of the most simple things you can do for story reassons but with today's video game's storys being outright told to the player becasse it as the easy way, not becasse there wasn't a other way around it,it's refreshing and unique when you really think about it.

One of the best parts of the game it's story and i can't talk about that becasse i don't want to do a oppise and spoil it and ruin it.

And i can go on about the AI,the DLC,the animation,the scavs,how it all works but it's 9 pm i need to go to bed so over all:

The game is for players that love to explore and experiment, but who are also willing to spend the time, willpower, and frustration to get better. Players that want a casual platformer will have their spirit broken inside of an hour or two. The game gives virtually no hand holding, wont apologize for the difficulty level, and won't even tell you how to win. You won't get any power ups, new abilities, experience points, level ups, or upgrades, and you start (and end) at the bottom of the food chain. Your reward for surviving this friendly nightmare is one of the best endings in video game history, a cool backstory, and the satisfaction of knowing that you can backflip-stab a giant lizard (about 30% of the time).

PROS: Huge world, fun ecosystem, lovely visual style and detail, emphasis on mastery, absolutely transcendental ending. Lots of replay value for lore hunters and completionists.

CONS: Floaty and sluggish (punz!) controls, occasional cheap deaths, ""RNG moments"", rage quits, awkward screen transitions, unhelpful map feature, wears out my patience if played more than an hour at a time. 

Notes: 

- It's not a reflexive twitch game, as videos would make it out to be. Most of the game is pretty chilled. i didn't feel i needed a sedative after playing it.

- Everything people say about the brutal difficult level is true... on ""easy"" mode. 

- I think the game overstays its welcome after a while. I felt i really just wanted to get to the next area. Not knowing where to go was frustrating. You need to really, truly LOVE exploration to like Rain World.

- The controls are really loose. Do not expect Mega Man or Celeste levels of precise platforming. Slugcat only does what i want about half the time. I feel like i'm ""negotiating"" with slugcat more than controlling slugcat.

- This is an exceptionally bad game for people with real claustrophobia. Most of the game is about shimmying through tiny pipes and cracks filled with water, in the dark, with things trying to eat you on both ends. But if you think that's cool, then it is cool.

- Despite the shortcomings, the many surreal experiences and the ending are worth struggling for. 

Tip: I recommend you skip playing as ""Monk"" (easy mode) and go straight to ""Survivor"" (Normal). Ironically, Survivor is probably easier and you get access to more of the lore.

I think i will have another go at it in the future, but i need to take the game in small doses for my personal sanity.

It has great atmosphere, very rewarding game play, a story that I believe is literally perfect, and contributes to at least half of my favorite songs of all time. Yet the game fails miserably at difficulty scaling and game design so bad I almost can't recommend it. 

The way I see it, this game is perfect aside from difficulty scaling and level design. To determine whether you will like this game we have to look at each of these and figure out if you're willing to deal with them to be able to enjoy the rest of what this game has to offer.

The first thing we will tackle is difficulty scaling. Usually when people think a game is too hard, it's not the difficulty in it of itself that's the problem, it's that the game is either unfair or doesn't scale the properly. The problem with rain world is the latter. With over 200 hours I can confidently say the game is not unfair. If you play perfect or near perfect you will never die. With this being said, you will die. You will die a lot. The reason for this is the knowledge necessary to play perfect will require you to die. For this reason, progress in this game is not only based on physical location, but also on what you have learned throughout the game. Getting to the next shelter can be less useful than learning what this creature does. However, this can be very frustrating if you haven't realized this yet, or simply don't enjoy this kind of game play loop. If you're willing to take the time necessary to learn the game, than this isn't really an issue, and can actually make the game more enjoyable.

Now for the real problem. Game design. Probably the most universally disliked aspect of rain world is the camera scroll. In most games, the camera will follow the player, keeping them in the center and able to see everything around them. Rain world does not do this. Instead, the game is divided into ""screens"", where you can only see the screen you are in at any given time. This leads to situations where you will die to something that was just off screen and you couldn't see. These situations are the only times where a death will be actually unfair. 

the next problem is... level design? I don't know exactly what to call it, but the problem is this: the game is non-linear. This in it of itself is not a problem. However, there is clearly a way that you should be going. You can go to the endgame within 3 hours of playtime. You can get effectively soft locked. Yes, it is better to restart than to try and get out. The game would be so much better with less non-linearity, at least between regions. There are simply areas of the game you don't want to be in at certain points of the play through. There is something meant to guide you, but it's directions are cryptic at best and illegible at worst. This is the games biggest flaw, and it can ruin the game if you go the wrong way.

The best way to explain it is this: if you can get through the bad design, you will love the game. I can guarantee you.",1682290215,1704674793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don´t understand anything, like, nothing. You start and already are pretty much on your on. A few tutorials, but that's it.
You are a slugcat.
Everything in this game is clunky, but In a good way. Not always, sometimes in a bad way.
Everything wants to eat you, or runs away so you don't eat them. Not always, sometimes estrange ""friendly"" interaction happens.
Everything is alive, even what shouldn't be. Not always, sometimes you kill them (or you die) (Or they kill themselves)
I don´t understand a single fkng thing in this game, which makes it a very interesting experience, such as finding out how something work, how to get somewhere, or how to kill something.
Yet, THERE IS ONE THING I GET: When I say ""Everything is alive"" I'm not talking about creatures, I'm talking about the environment. 

The whole game is alive, how everything interacts, how it really feels like what could be a real animal kingdom.
You see what seems to be ""intelligent"" creatures, creatures fighting between them, creatures hunting other creatures, creatures hunting you, creatures hiding, creatures creatures creatures creatures...

Rain World is an immersive simulator, that disguises itself as a metroidvania-style game, when in reality it's a science experiment by a curious developer. What Rain World excels at is being a digital world-building masterpiece, where you truly feel the influence of the environment and surroundings on the life of the slug cat, a creature at the bottom of the food chain. What it doesn't excel at, is being a fun video game. Rain World has difficult to master controls, proven by the 20+ page movement Google Docs document that is considered essential to play the game, but referenced nowhere on the Steam page. You find yourself spending more time backtracking to your previous location after an unfair and impossible to get out of death due to invisible enemies, or simply difficult to comprehend AI. 

The design of Rain World as a video game is poor. The design of Rain World as an immersive simulator is excellent. 

If that's something that interests you, and you desire to take part in the developer's walking simulator science experiment, and don't mind the frustration of unfair deaths and poor game design, Rain World might be for you.

It can be very difficult and sometimes feel unfair, also the fact that there is hardly any direction and it's very easy to get lost. But I think its a game that everyone should at least try playing. If you stick with it it can be incredibly rewarding. 

Learning the quirks of every enemy type like how to avoid them and their AI, exploring the giant beautiful world, learning how to improve your limited movement as you go along, it feels great.

Rain World does a really good job of creating an ecosystem that can go on and does go on without you. Enemies fight and kill each other without you interacting with them at all. It also does a good job of making you feel like the slugcat: lost and alone at least at the start and not on the top or bottom of the food chain. A skilled player can kill even some of Rain World's most dangerous enemies.
Then there's the world. It's massive, likely over 1000 rooms but that's just a guess. All of it is beautifully crafted with tons of small details everywhere. 
The music is incredible. idk what I can say about it besides that it's just incredible. 

All of this combined helps to make the game's atmosphere. Rain World creates a really good atmosphere. Also I did say there was hardly any direction but if you need some just follow where the yellow thing tells you to go. 






So should you get this game? Yes definitely, it is a really well built amazing game despite sometimes feeling a bit unfair and being very challenging I think its worth sticking with.

This game has some very good aspects to it. The difficulty is great for those who like challenges, the system makes you feel like you are prey (which I think is the goal), and there are lots of places to advance to. The music too, is excellent, and plays at the right moment, while silent in others to make the game have some tone while still feeling like the natural world, where it is quiet save for wildlife and environment. Further, the art style brings in retro well, but is still unique. Also much appreciated was the way that the screen did not follow the character. Other Metroidvanias, they tend to follow the thing you control and have limited fields of view because of this. Do not think Rain World would work if one could not have the whole scene because of the way enemies and such are. Having stated this, and hopefully shown that it is a good game still, there are some places where it feels unpolished and negative in its tutorial and guide system. Aside from a brief how-to at the start, the systems are not explained. Should be a way to understand how to combat enemies better, how to befriend neutral things better, and explore. The guide does an okay job showing where to go, but what stops new players from ignoring it is nothing, which can be very discouraging when lost in harder areas. On top of that, while I do not mind this because I like the challenge, there is a lot of dying involved. The timer to get to safety should be a little longer, at least at the start of the game so people can explore to get a feel better, in my view. Simply put, mechanics needed to be better explained and the goals need to be better highlighted. A further grievance, while not with the game but the community, is that this game is often compared to Hollow Knight. My only reason for playing. For those reading this review because they have been recommended it for that reason, these games are not comparable. While they are both listed as Metroidvanias, Hollow Knight had lots more combat, a way to advance through grinding things, and a narrative brought through other characters and lore. This also has as story, and is similarly difficult, but in a way where advancement is based on skill rather than progress by in-game abilities, and narrative is mostly done by way of cut-scenes. If here to replicate Hollow Knight, would not recommend. But, if you are up for a fun challenge, and looking to feel like you are in nature on a food chain, do play. It is an incredible and unique game with great development behind it, but its not for me as much as I may have wanted it to be.",1704451047,1704451047,False,1,0,0.491071432828903198,0,True,False,False

The creatures in this game feel less like obstacles, and more like creatures. They exist to exist. They look for food before the cycle ends and find shelter when it does, just like you do.

While the controls are weird and clunky at first, you could change your controls in the settings to something else that you're more comfortable with. And the clunkiness, thats just what you're gonna have to deal with and get used to because of how the movement is dynamic and physics based. But that clunkiness is definitely worth it.

Rainworld is, as advertised, a challenging ecosystem simulator that puts you in the middle to low end of the food chain, (depending on what class you pick,) and it really feels like it; but don't let that scare you off. The game's ambient soundtrack is more than enough to keep you level headed while playing, which you will want to be if you wish to outsmart, and in some cases even befriend or tame the other creatures.

My first impression of playing this game back a couple years ago has left me with indescribable feelings I've yet to gain from any game. That in and of itself is special. A connection unlike any other, spiritual maybe, as this game does deal with life and death; a creature torn from it's family early on and forced to survive until it finds it's purpose in a long and forgotten world flooded by relentless rain. Without spoiling, a greater goal awaited this creature, a goal that is beyond comprehension that makes everything else seem so pointless.

Rain World is truly a one of a kind game. The artistic style of the game is nothing short of amazing as well as the soundtrack, which both serve to support the intense immersion of the world. Everything that makes this game unique works so well to create a believable ecosystem that surpasses what can be labeled as a just a video game. It's quite uncanny how realistic the ecosystem found in this game can feel, almost like it's an entirely different being disconnected from lines of code pasted onto a screen. From the various creatures to the places you can explore you'll get lost in the world of this game; with it's fully living ecosystem and very intelligent AI it makes for an amazing yet difficult experience. 

There's the main story mode as well as an arena mode where you can play to your liking with friends and experiment with various creatures and weapons. While traversing through the world it can be difficult, unfair, and at times very random, even though it is a very difficult game for newcomers you end up finding other ways to conquer and get past challenges you face. There's multiple different 'slug cats' you can play as, all with different abilities and difficulty levels; so even if you're having a hard time surviving you can turn down the difficulty to your liking. If you're thinking about trying this game out I would definitely recommend it as it brings with it an unforgettable experience that I myself have never and will never forget.

This game is not for the impatient, nor for those looking for a quick play. It demands your time, quick reactions, as well as your sanity if you go the wrong route.
Rain World is also a very emotion-driven story about an old world slowly collapsing, where people are left to ponder their mistakes all around the idea that re-spawning is an actual story point in this world. If you are willing to go through an uphill battle on your very first playthorugh and make it out the other side, then the story that is given is worth it.

Although it may take you up to 100 hours to get accustomed to control the body of a slugcat, after you have internalised all the movement and fighting techniques and familiar with all the traits of different species, I believe that you will start to see the amazing part of this game. All these will make you a real slugcat and temporarily forget that you are actually not more than a human player, since the physics are so well simulated and the scenes so well designed. You will feel like a tiny component in an enormous ecosystem, thrilled by the mighty power of the downpour, the intricate interactions between species, and the shocking beauty of the art of environments. You will travel afar and have rich experiences. You will learn a different philosophy of life, time, and history. You will even start to reflect on your identity as a human being.

Play Rainworld, if you are not scared of the difficulty to survive as a weak small creature.

The game is being recommended to people with mindless meme drivel or implications that its just a simulator of playing as a cute and small creature in a big world. I've been asked by friends if the game even has an ending, because the way people talk about this game completely obscures what it actually is. 

Rain World is a stress-inducing journey through an abandoned civilization brimming with danger. This game combines somewhat precise platforming with unusual controls, aggressive and intelligent enemies with fairly one-dimensional combat abilities, and a massive interconnected world of infrequent checkpoints with a dynamic time limit. The game only tells you how to utilize those sparse checkpoints and offers occasional directional guidance. Otherwise, you are on your own. The odds are greatly stacked against you, and as such you will certainly die, over and over again. 
But as you explore the world further, become comfortable with the unique controls and the combat, get used to the time limit for each of your daily outings, you begin to feel immersed within the dynamic world the game offers. You will find yourself wondering about the history of this wrecked world you've been wandering through, or wondering what the function of each unique area was in the now abandoned civilization-- how the world all comes together in one big picture-- as I did in my first journey through Rain World. 
The feelings of discovery you will experience in Rain World are rarely matched in gaming, and I think that is truly something special. You will suffer as you explore the interconnected world, meeting new dangers around every corner, and that experience of the cruel indifference of nature becomes almost euphoric. It's quite rare to feel truly small and weak in a video game, yet Rain World perfectly captures that experience and something about it was really revelating for me. Despite the capabilities offered by the unique controls, your brain will be your greatest ally as your traverse Rain World. Whether it is outsmarting dangers, finding the best pathing through an area, or discovering a previously unknown mechanic to you, you will certainly experience that great feeling of overcoming the insurmountable.
That, I believe, is the experience Rain World seeks to induce in its players. Overcoming. Learning. Surviving. Against all of the odds stacked against you in a massive, cruel world.",1703848003,1703848003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoy that it doesn't feel punishing when I die or mess up. Makes it less disheartening to continue. The map itself is a maze of tunnels leading to other places. And you seriously have to keep track of that timer in the bottom corner. Otherwise, the rain will come without your knowing. It's such a cool concept to have every cycle on a timer.

No review, no let's play video, nothing can truly prepare you for this game. You either will love it or hate it. Just remember that steam refunds is a thing and that you can try this game on your own and decide if you like this game or not

Now that this off my chest lets talk about rainworld.

+ Slapping soundtrack
+ It's pixel art suits the game
+ True rainworlding experience

/ Can be difficult and frustrating for people

This is Rainworld.

You play as a slugcat. You were torn appart from your family and now you are alone.
This is Rainworld. Such a small creature in such big world... the first on the foodchain. You feel lost. You feel frustrated. You wonder what will you do with your life and if you will even survive.

And the gameplay shows.

There aren't many tutorials, it just goes through the basics. Slugcat feels at the beggining like a bag of potatoes that you are trying to stir like a car on a ice. The are is easier then other areas but still there is danger. You can die and the map feels large and scary. But you are going through.

Because this is Rainworld.

A world where every creature is stuck in a cycle. It's death is not definitive as it comes back again and again. People trying to find out how to get out of this circle creating things and entities that would find the definitive question.

And again.... the gameplay shows that.

The deaths while punishing are quick. There isn't too long sequence when you die, you just are dead, shows your karma going down. You wake up. You go again. You have to expect with this game that you will die and you will die a lot, but for me for example dying wasn't punishing it was fun. I learnt more, or I will choose a different route. Thanksto the fact that this game works like an ecosystem, the danger changes. There might be different lizards or they might me somewhere else making this game less stale.

And at the end you will find the characters, you will find the lore and go through various very interesting locations that will kick your ass but then you will learn how to love them. 

Its a true masterpiece. I love this game and didn't find a game that would get close to the experience I had with Rainworld.

I has three characters that are basically difficulty in the base game.

Monk is considered the easy mode by many, however I believe it is the good character for a tutorial. There is still many dangers ahead but the experience isn't as frustrating. You will learn layouts of the maps with Monk without the frustration of other slugcats. The true banana boy.

Survivor is the basic rainworld experience. The story doesn't change as much but it is good spike of difficulty as you continue through.

Hunter is the challenge mode. You have limited time to do your objective and the world is out to kill you. For me this was frustrating experience but some will like th achallenge.

If you want more. I highly recommend buying the DLC as it adds so much to the game as 5 more slugcat campaigns, expeditions and multiplayer.

Highly recommend.

You are playing a slugcat, very cute little creature living in the world that is rather cruel. The world is immersive from the moment you start the game washed up divided appart from your family unknowing about the area you are in.

The controls might be unituitive at first and you will struggle. Oh you will struggle so much that you will wonder if you ever even have known if you learnt how to jump, grab or use items, but the longer you play the more you master this game. The magic is that you won't lose the challenging part of it.

There are still danger noodles everywhere and even if you learn how to dodge or kill them you never know what they will do thank to the great Ai, dangerous at the best and..... funny at the worst. (Seriously blue spinny lizards are such mood) 

There is still a lot to learn, only the movement guide that you can find on the internet is over 50 pages long, but you don't need to learn all of those to play and finish this game (Even though it could help)

The pixelart has its charm, for some coudl appear ugly at first, but it has such beauty with background and areas that you will stand and try to take the view (if you aren't chased by even more danger noodled and danger noodle deluxe edition with added wings and maybe even the animal equivalent of a shooting gun) You will learn to love the tiny slugcat body and its tiny eyes.

The lore is there for those who want and the base game carries short and interesting story. 

I can't recommend this game enough. If you like to play games not to finish it or for the progress (Because you will die and you will die a lot)  and are playing games for rather challenging experience I would give this game a shot.

The ecosystem is incredibly complex and lively, and the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous. It is a very polarizing game though, since it's incredibly easy to get lost and find yourself victim to really unfair RNG. Rainworld doesn't necessarily reward your progress either, but it works much in favor of the story. You are, to put it simply, just a slugcat. You don't get any special abilities or armour or anything, but instead learn the ins and outs of the world. Alot of times, the game will kill you and it might be unfair, or you might get close enough to a shelter but get killed over and over. Each death can be a lesson, and over time you learn to live as a slugcat.

You play as a small weak omnivorous animal known as a slugcat, a spry critter that can easily worm it's way through passages and pipes! this is where your main advantages are in this game, most threats you wouldn't wanna face head on but more worm your way around. And your small size and lack of defenses means you do have a lot of threats.
Luckily for you not everyone is against you! You are guided by a mysterious but seemingly benevolent creature known as an Overseer, It's able to somehow manifest holograms which it uses to help you progress! I'd recommend to follow it if you can figure out what it's trying to tell you.
Another potential ally is a scavenger, which is a social species that you can gain the friendship of via gifts!
I don't really have much more i can say on this game, as i haven't managed to uncover any story, but the gameplay and having you fill a much lesser role than what most games would have you fill has lead this to be one of my favorite games I've played so far!",1703647474,1703647474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it bases a lot of things around random chance. like for example enemy placement.
so that means there is a lot of bs moments.
there is things to be learned but it mostly is RNG based.
the game looks very nice but it doesnt play very nice.
some controls feel off.
maybe its because i was using a ps4 controller.
but i do intend on finishing or at least playing this more some time in the future.


i got this on discount for like 15 bucks. normaly this would cost 25$. so yeah way to overprised for an indie game. and the DLC as well regarded. i thought this game would have more interesting and deep machanics but i was wrong. the most interesting thing slugcat could do where all the movement tricks (wich i thought where pretty cool).
also this game kinda scammed me. i thought this was a coop game and it is but only if you buy the expansion.(it shows up for some reason at the tags window wich is for the game but it doesnt say anything about it only being for the DLC)

Lemme tell you, this is the best game I have ever played. It has kept me entertained far longer than anything else besides maybe sonic mania or sonic mega collection +. The amount of replayability this has, especially with downpour (and of course the lovely mods, even if I have not played with them to their fullest extent due to incapability at this point in time), with expeditions being included and emphasized with that, is immense! Its not for everyone, especially with how hard it is to master the controls (I personally got use to them really fast), but it's difficulty is part of its charm.

I have completed the entire expedition challenges page, gotten at least one ending for all of the campaigns, obtained all but two colored pearls, and am only missing one Spearmaster broadcast. I plan on doing it all again several times after I 100% my primary save on xbox, just because I have enjoyed it so much. I have exclaimed that I hate this game many times in the few months I have played it, but it comes from a place of oxymoronic love.

I can't recommend this to most people, but if you can look at the game, know that it is blatantly unfair to the player, poorly designed, and overall a ""bad game"", if you can look at all those things and still have an interest in the world?
Go ahead, give it a try, its worth the 2 hour refund period at the very least.
Rain World was certainly an experience, I don't know if it was a good one, but I'm glad I took the time to play it.
Oh, if you have any friends who have played the game, do ask them for help whenever you get stuck, and don't be mean to the blue person, they just want a friend.

100 extra hours of pain and confusion. But I was strongly engaged the entire time.

rainworld gets a 10/10 on the breakable scale. i've managed to break the game multiple times without having a single idea how i broke it. please play this game if you love seeing such a great game be so fucking stupid

one time i clipped into a salamander's neck and got stuck there while it kept spinning around and trying to eat me,
i once had an imaginary spear on hunter's back that made no noise when being thrown nor did it noticably hit anything,
i've broken the pause screen controls image and gotten stuck in the floor many times. please help.
i once witnessed a raindeer, specifically the one i was riding at the time, get stuck under another raindeer for half the cycle, and then spontaneously fling itself across the map at full speed and somehow still manage to keep me alive and make it to subterranean. not sure i even had anything to do with it.
during my entire artificer campaign the dreams refused to work, i would not appear in them and would result in an infinitely playing raining screen. perfection. one time a vulture ate my pups while i was absent and then all the creatures froze before something that looked like it came from a horror game appeared in the corner of my screen just. staring at me.
my hunter ending screen displayed the same void swimming screen 5 times and only changing once and then proceeding to do the same thing as before. no nsh screen i guess. i played that entire campaign to see nsh. think that's some significant harrassment right there might i say.
one time i was playing riv and i regurgitated 5p's music pearl for whatever reason and had dropped my rarefaction cell to grab the music pearl but for some fucking reason when i grabbed the music pearl the cell just randomly evaporated. how what where

I don`t even know where to begin...well, at the start of course.
You get dropped into this lovingly made, detail rich world with just enough ""personal"" story to feel a connection to your character. Why the "".."" you may ask and thats bc there are 2 stories here to unravel. First the personal story for every character (DLC Downpour included) that is prette obvious and then there is THE story that ties all storys, all characters together into one big picture, don't believe me? Check on youtube if you want to get spoiled, this game that is at first glance just a really hard and sweet platformer has such a deep story that it`s 1h 30min as a lore video.
And here comes my only critique if you can call it that, you are so busy exploring and surviving this wonderful compley ecosystem that you WILL miss 90% of the story...I hate that reference but think of it as the story in dark souls, there is one, yeah, and its genius and complex yeah, but if you don`t actively search for it you will miss it. But thats not that big of a deal because of the Ecosystem in Rainworld. Everything has its place or rather...it..doesn`t? Yeah so Rainwordls AI and creatures don'r really care if youre there or not, you are not the main character to them, to those creature you are just a meal passing by and Rainworld does such a good job making you feel close to the bottom of the food chain. But even then you are given tools, weapons and such that CAN turn the favours in your way again. You are just one small cog in a much larger machinery, much larger then your charakter and even you can comprehend in the beginning. And don`t get me startet on Scavangers those cheeky bastards. Their AI is so complex they organize like a real tribe and will even try and ""communicate"" with you when you`re not hostile...but I've bin babbbling on here for far too long alredy, if you`re still here reading this thank thank you for your time and I hope you have a splendid time exploring this rainy world and discovering its secrets :D",1703077917,1703077917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Add to that you also lose progression whenever you die and you can see why only 27% of players got the first achievement (as of the time of writing this review at least).

The illusion of being part of an ecosystem also fell off as I started to notice that, most of the time, predators would be laser-focused on me as soon as I entered the screen.

Having completed all of the achievements and ran though the game multiple times, I can say that this game is awesome. While I know it is not everyone's cup of tea, being RNG-Based at times, and the difficulty because of it, it is its own little world- literally. Most everything isn't scripted (with some exceptions) and you can for the most part choose what you want to do. Want to go on a killing spree? Ok! Just be careful of what the consequences may bring. Want to tame the entire lizard population? Go for it! 
And because it isn't scripted, dying to strategically placed pole mimics, being eaten by a lizard for being in the wrong place in the wrong time, etc, you become a part of the world that this game has created. You are among some of the many creatures of this game that are just as wild as the creatures in real life can be.  

The story the game and it's DLC brings is very nice. I will not spoil it, but playing through each of the campaigns was a wild ride- and the story begins to unfold itself as you play, with even more hidden that you may not find at a first glance. 
I encourage those who have taken interest in this game, but have not gotten it, to please enjoy it as much as I do. It is difficult at times, and very frustrating when you keep dying over and over, but do not drop it because of that. You will see that as you get better, you will be able to get past most of the areas that once gave you so much trouble much easier than when you first stumble your way through.",1618608204,1702958496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes it is a challenge in the beginning but that's the fun of it, you have to progress and get better see how far you could really go in this world.

The art style is amazing and same for the gameplay and I have rarely seen much bugs.

What personally makes me love this game is it's basically an endless game of fun, there's expeditions after you get tired of the story. And the story is amazing full of lore and adventures.

So, my advice is you should try this game it's a really awesome game.

The AI here is truly amazing for something from a two-man team, with creatures moving about and interacting with the world and with each other in unscripted, procedurally-generated ways. The atmosphere is mesmerizing, and the game is full of mystery from the get-go. The world is surprisingly vast and you can sink a ton of hours into this if you want to. 

At first blush, the play control feels clunky and uncomfortable, but as you get used to it (and adapt to the fact that combat isn't really the focus here)  it feels mostly perfect. I do like using a couple mods, though, like the one where you can dual-wield. 

It is a difficult game (even with mods) with a lot more depth than you probably expect. 

I recommend going into this game as blind as you can, except for maybe looking up a tutorial on the play control mechanics. It's really fun to discover the many secrets of this game for yourself.

- wishes to experience an alien world in all its terror and glory through the eyes of essentially a newborn
- seeks to feel a sense of awe and wonder
- is fascinated by nature and cycles of life, death, and rebirth
- prefers the joy of discovery and mastery to linear objectives and story
- enjoys a game that is indifferent to your desire to be the hero character
- enjoys a limited control scheme that is difficult to master
- enjoys intense platforming experiences
- enjoys intense survival mechanics
- embraces failure
- is okay experiencing misfortune often
- is okay with unanswered questions
- is okay with games that have a timer running at all times
- is okay with looking at the wiki for answers to unanswered questions
- enjoys the payoff of a large time commitment
- does not have difficulty with anger management
- is not afraid or spiders, bugs, creepy crawlies, or the dark
- spends a lot of time with the thoughts in their head
- enjoys philosophy

Rainworld is a game that is difficult to recommend to people. Why? Because the best way to experience the game is also the most frustrating and nonsensical for the average gamer. Almost nothing is told to you about the game mechanincs, controls, or your objectives. Because of this I'm sure 95% of people who try the game quit shortly after starting it. However, for the rare persistent person who values discovery and mastery, the payoff is massive. If those two things are not a primary motivator in your gaming experience I think you will struggle to enjoy what is offered here.

Those who stick around will find a MASSIVE world full of bizarre alien flora, fauna, and vistas looking to be explored. This is the up-front draw of the game but pretty much everything here wants to eat you so surviving is a challenge. Rainworld wants you to experience loss and the inevitability of death. It wants you to realize that what you can do is limited to your place in the foodchain and the cycles of death and reincarnation. Much of the satisfaction of the game comes from overcoming the odds stacked against you as you slowly gain knowledge of your environment use it to live another day. In many ways Rainworld is the antithesis to modern gaming. Instead of drawing you in with shiny loot and power fantasies, it hides most of its best experiences behind hours of mistakes you will make in exploring the world and the gameplay. Later on as you get a grip on surviving you will begin to ask questions and want answers. They are difficult to find. Your final journey to get them is challenging but few game resolutions have had as much of an impact on me as this one.

If somehow I haven't scared you off and you are still wanting to give the game a try I'd recommend you play for an hour or so and get familiar with some of the ideas and concepts. Then go look at a movement and mechanics guide on steam or the wiki to help you understand some of the basics. Oh and also there are some great maps out there! I think this will improve your experience with the game immensely without spoiling any of the later discoveries down the road. I've played over 100 hours and I'm still constantly learning new tricks and tips that would've kept me from dying so many times. There's no shame in making things a bit easier on yourself so you can enjoy the rest of what it has to offer. 

I came into Rainworld originally expecting to play as a cute slugcat and appreciate the art. I didn't expect to find a game that attempted to recreate ecosystems, get me to ask existential questions, or rage quit for months at a time. If you're ready to commit to something like that, I wish you luck and hope you find it as fascinating as I have. 

p.s. - if you love the base game, the DLC  Dounpour is beyond worth it. So much content included and made primarily by fans of the game. It's incredible.",1702530705,1702530851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The controls are awful. Too many actions are bound to too few buttons. Picking up, eating, swallowing (separate from eating), vomiting up, swapping hands, and dropping are all on one button. When carrying something in each hand, it's hard to tell which one you're going to throw if you hit the throw button. Trying to grab on to the correct pole when jumping between multiple ones is very hard, and some of the poles are hungry creatures in disguise. Sometimes you can't tell if a jump is impossible to make or if you're just doing it wrong.

The map is too big, too visually similar, too painful to navigate. The progression system sucks. The only way to know where you're supposed to go is to stand around until a little yellow bug pops up and highlights the door that will take you in the right direction.

The living ecosystem stuff is impressive, except that all you can really do is just avoid every creature you see. And they spawn in different places each life, so sometimes your path is completely blocked with stuff that's not worth dealing with, while other times it's a walk in the park.

These qualities alone were enough to power me through my experience with the game. But when it comes to actually playing the game, the level of jank present in the game slams you in the face. In a game so heavily dependent on movement, you feel so out of control of your character and at times it feels like it's a roll of the dice as to whether you actually get to do what you intend. It's at such a level to where it sometimes feels like it's a ragebait game.

I like the art style, but it is virtually impossible to figure out where you're supposed to go, all you get is a symbol projected from a worm somewhere in the screen, which leads to looping around trying to find a shelter or your objective. The gameplay loop is literally just ""wake up, eat, avoid enemies, sleep before the rain"". That's it. The enemies are overpowered, even on the [b]easiest fucking difficulty[/b].

I am also kind of salty that I was baited into buying this game because ""they were gonna delist it due to unity shenanigans so better buy it now"". That is a shitty business tactic, especially considering Unity backpedaling their proposed changes.

Honestly, the reviews saying that Rain World is a ""streamer bait rage game disguised as an indie metroidvania"" are kind of true in my opinion.

All in all, wait for a sale if you want it, preferably at a 60% discount or higher.

However, as a whole, it asks too much of the player's mental strenght to withstand a fractal-shaped stochastic process of random bs that neither you nor the developer himself can possibly predict or even adapt to. And on top of that, you are on a timer.

Some of the frustrations I experienced are (but not limited to):
- NPC dying offscreen to a very specific hostile creature and its corpse - supposedly - phasing through the floor clogging the only practical way to get back to safety;
- falling down into a pit because some NPC popped out of the tunnel you just used, spazzing out the physics and launching you to your doom;
- hostile NPCs getting stuck on each other preventing you to go forward, potentially wasting an entire cycle.

I won't judge this game solely on these admittedly rare yet incredibly frustrating situations, because I don't want to take away from the spotlight the most perplexing aspect that affects the whole game: the camera.
Why does this game have fixed cameras? How am I supposed to be constantly aware of my surroundings?
I lost count how many times I jumped into some lizard's mouth who was just chilling in the transition from one fixed camera to the next or fell down from a platform in the same manner.
It doesn't come to a surprise that the most effective way to deal with mobs is just tunneling back and forth.

Despite all that I pushed through because this does feel like a really ambitious project and I congratulate the dev to manage to pull it off... but it's just not for me and I would recommend this game only to those with a pain threshold high enough to withstand competitive crotch kicking.

This makes the world truly feel alive on a level that no game has ever managed to achieve.

The story is also great, especially if you have the Downpour expansion, which i strongly urge you to get if you engoyed the game. You play as Slugcat, i little, slimy thing at the bottom of the food chain that wants nothing but to find their parents, though later on, you realise that you can serve a much greater puropse.

Be aware though that the game has a very minimal tutorial, so you have to figure out how to interact with the items and creatures yourself, though this further adds to the feeling of being small and and lonely.",1702123124,1702123124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Allow me to preface by saying that this game is INSANELY brutal. If you want to make the game slightly easier, I suggest getting mods like ""Struggle"" to make it slightly easier for your first time. Even then, the game is NOT for everyone. Death is a constant, and I advise anyone who has a short temper to not play Rain World. 

Rain World is a heavily chance-based game (not RNG). In a region, enemies will wander, going about activities as its species would. Each type of enemy has its own AI, and acts differently. Green Lizards are fairly dense, mindlessly chasing after prey, Pole Plants will lay dormant, awaiting foolish players, [spoiler] and the passive Void Worm will intently observe the Slugcat as it descends into the Void Sea. [/spoiler]


As the name of the game suggests, there is rain, and it is [i] deadly [/i]. each cycle's length is represented by a random number of small dots around your karma level (hold your map button to view). each dot represents 30 seconds, and once all of the dots disappear, the deadly rain comes, crushing you, should you not make it to a shelter. Survive a cycle and you'll be rewarded with a raise in your karma, allowing you to travel to different regions

Perfect summary: ""Despite all my rage""

This game gave me Ever hood vibes in terms of how its story works, which I won't explain here, in terms of game play the premise is simple and straightforward after 1-2 runs. You don't need to explore if you know where to go, saving you tons of time.

The game is difficult, primarily due to everything being able to instantly stun / kill you (with the former usually leading to your death anyway) and the fact that you as the player are essentially throwing needles at monsters. It does sell off the point on the positioning of the slug cats in the system though, with wit acting as their main advantage over other creatures. I found myself annoyed at a lot of situations, especially the white lizards. Though, I was more of a person that flees rather than attacked. The game is slightly easier if you face some foes head on rather than run.

I recall seeing a you tuber play this game a year or two ago, Saw the game but didn't put much notice to it, But it's picked up traction ever since its DLC which likely means that it has a very positive reception, DLC reviews would likely be kept on the DLC page though.

Anyway, the gameplay is ""unique,"" It's not something i've played before mechanic wise but it feels familar in a way, the enemies are varied and actually dangerous, forcing the player to employ specific tactics for each species. Some of them being outright unsettling (pole plant, monster weed, all of the spider enemies) and others are... things you wish never existed.

This initially felt like a rage game especially during the farm array and the higher areas of the game. but despite all that I still employed effort throughout the game in favour of curiousity, the main driving force of the game i'd say. If the game play is dis-interesting then curiosity is the only thing that keeps most people playing, which is fine. and it's even done well. the game gives you a silent introduction, and the game remains silent after that. Nobody will talk or say anything of worth excluding 2 NPCs which are far away from one-another and are also optional too. with this, the player is given nothing; with the whole unknown to explore, allowing them to pick up more information depending on how interested they are. 

The only question the game focuses on is ""when"" since all the characters have their own ""set times"" in which the world changes depending on who you play as. This makes the world feel alive.

I'd recommend the game to anyone who's looking for a little challenge and prefers a silent game. Similar to elden ring and other rage-esq games that farm off the rage of its players intentionally, the game can be very difficult especially for some rooms and classes, but this is all for the greater message; and its a good challenge that relies on knowledge, wit and sometimes just chance, just how a real life wild encounter would be. The prey must use wit against the brute of their predators. So despite all my rage, I still would consider the experience enjoyable. Rage doesn't always equal an issue with the game. The only real gripe I have is how the lack of proper communication was between the player and rain deer, a complaint that seems to be a common one by looking through feeds of other player experiences


Everhood, I initally disliked how it ended and felt like all my efforts were for nothing, but as I thought about it, it began to shine upon some curiousities that many people have and resolve everything with a simple statement;

""Don't overthink it, You live in a shadow to soon envelop the light, it's your choice in whether you wish to dig deeper or cease.""

This game gave me a similar message, though on a more confusing scale.

Also you play as slug cats, who doesn't want that?

But I really do NOT recommend this game.

It has no respect for your time. Enemy and item placements are randomized on every death, meaning that countless attempts  to save points are spent dying to unfair enemy placements/interactions until luck is suddenly on your side. 

I understand that this game wants you to feel small and powerless in this ecosystem, but unfair, unpredictable, and inconsistent gameplay is not the way to do so. In the end the game just makes you feel frustrated at uncontrollable RNG that, sure, reflects the oppressiveness of the ecosystem, but that could be achieved in much more thoughtful ways.

Rain World is ABRASIVE. It is frustrating and unfair and expects you to deal with it for hours on end. There is a lot to enjoy here, but its honestly not worth the struggle.

Those are great, but what makes this game special for me aren't just those things. For one, the theme of reincarnation is generally under-explored -- not only by games (surprising, considering how almost every game's fail state is death and the very next moment is you being alive again) but also by media in general. Reincarnation is a wonderful theme that lets allows us to think about some of the grand, difficult questions. What do we value once survival is out of the equation? Of course, in the real world, every living creature dies, so survival isn't really out of the equation. Does that change our answer? Regardless, what do we make of the inexorability of real, permanent death? These questions linger in the air -- the weighty backdrop of every screen in Rain World. The game, elegantly, doesn't need to lean on telling you this through text. On your journey, the omnipresent pixel-art decay around you hammers these themes home; there used to be civilization here, and now there is not. At your destination, you've made a choice.

The game's themes of reincarnation, I suppose because their origins in eastern philosophy, come packaged with ecological themes -- this world will happy exist without you. In one the best display of this that I've ever seen in a video game, creatures will treat you (and each other) with varying (and rational) degrees of hostility. Creatures will fight each other. You're not the only creature near the bottom of the food chain in this world and you can occasionally see another creature become prey. The fact that all of this is systems-driven, not scripted, is wonderful.

I'm convinced Rain World is a beautiful thing. I just wish younger me believed in himself enough to git gud instead of watching the endings on YouTube.",1701805379,1701805379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rain World is hard. You need to learn how to move almost from scratch cause the movement here is unique and has a lot of hidden elements that you can not even notice in your first playthough.
Not only a movement is unique, the graphics, the animations, the most complex ecosystem i've ever seen.
The game doesn't tell you anything and it's beauty lies within the exploration. You won't be guide by hand though this landscape and it's truly the Slugcat journeys alone. At first you'll be most likely feel defenseless, a prey in the world of predators but as you surviving you learn how to protect yourself, learn things about the local ecosystem, differences between species and more so on.
I can talk about Rain World for hours. It already has so much to offer you in the base game but there's the DLC that gives you twice as more, not even speaking of the community mods.

I love you rain world <3",1701564055,1701564055,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Does the game contain frustrating and unfair deaths that sometimes make you feel like you are playing a poorly designed game? It does. But somehow I still had an incredible time playing it and couldn't stop thinking about the game no matter what I was doing during my days. Maybe it's that I always felt like I was actually growing as a person while playing it. Just the fact that almost every area is worse than the previous one, or horrible in some new way I didn't know I hated, but that I somehow still always found a way to keep trying and keep going and overcoming all that the game threw at me... That meant something. I feel like I have gotten a new, fundamental understanding for what it means to obsess over how things would be better if something was different: Sometimes they are of course, but there will always be challenges in life, ideally you just choose which ones you like facing best. And that's a good thing; I had fun returning to this torturous game, even when I was scared. It gives you purpose and enables growth. I think the goal is to grow comfortable with your own personal challenge, understand that failure is never the end of things and to become present and at home in your struggles. Embrace them, they are your journey. They are your purpose.

yes, this is a positive review.
this game... is a work of art. there's absolutely breathtaking visuals to be found here, and it provides some of the best environmental design and storytelling I've ever seen. It's also just a treasure trove of creativity.

I refunded because it quickly became clear this is an extremely hardcore experience, on a genre (platformers) I frankly don't super enjoy. Just because -I- don't like it, doesn't mean I can't recognize how good of a game this is, and it doesn't really have much in terms of faults beyond personal taste or preferences on my end. this is, put simply, a great game that I don't like playing.

Creatures AI use the limits of their body to explore the world. While a normal game has a basic ""walk forward animation"" that plays while something moves in the forward direction, Rain World first has the something reach out with it's leg, and if it can contact a surface, then it's allowed to move.

If you like exhilarating chase games with a timer and puzzles, go for it. It will give you a great time.

I hope others risk a biscuit on this game, but keep a timer up to know when you hit 3 hours, because that's when you need to decide if playing another 60 hours, or 120, or 500 (for each of the DLC characters combined) is really worth your time and money.

It's a very interesting world to explore and it has been fun to pick up now and then to play through some cycles. The music while sparse is very on point and always adds to the atmosphere of the region. The regions themselves are very well thought out, so much visual storytelling going on. And I think the rain mechanic is particularly impressive and conveys so much raw power through such simple visual tricks.

So, exploring is fun. But don't get me wrong. The combat in this game is hot garbage and I'm glad I played on Monk first because I don't think I would've put up with it on Survivor (I did manage to go back and complete Survivor after completing two Monk campaigns). Enemies are fun to watch going about their habitat from a distance, but so much close encounters end up being, ""Whelp, I'm dead."" And progressing through regions on Survivor mode basically involves a bunch of sheer dumb luck with enemy placements. A well simulated ecosystem where you are one of the weakest organisms does not make a fun game experience. 

Also, I'm not sure how to get into a practical demonstration of how the game falls totally flat on guiding you on what to do next and explaining the lore in ways that visual storytelling could not achieve without spoiling anything. But let's just say, after playing for a few hours I had to consult the wiki to find out what was even going on and I have no doubt you will be consulting it, too. And the ending of the game is such a pretentious slog where the developers find it in themselves to effectively waste around 10-20 minutes of your time for what ends up feeling like, ""Errr...okay? That's it? You couldn't have communicated this ending any faster?""

I rarely ever play hard games because they tend to be hard because of sharp difficulty spikes and my lack of patience. that being said i LOVE this game, despite having difficulty spikes because the difficulty spikes are usually self imposed, and if it's to hard in one area you can pull through and stick to your current route or go another way around. there have been plenty of times in both the base game and the dlc where i got stuck just to realize that, yes you can distract predators and get away with just enough time to spare to reach a save point, or that there was a hidden path right next to me that completely avoids the thing that just killed me 50 times in a row without fail. i will say there is a story to the game and it's actually kind of hidden out of the way with you only getting a very small portion of it if you don't go out of your way to get it, and i should throw in a warning for people with the base game, if you care about lore DON'T loose or trade any colored pearls as they will NOT re-spawn unless you change that in the settings. despite how hard the game is i some how found myself playing hard mode and beating it. the Only other hard game I've loved as much as this in terms of combat and story is hollow knight.

if you want to play, I highly recommend you play it as blindly as possible for all 3 (or 8-9 with dlc) characters for the biggest impact, but if you have been spoiled like i was, don't worry you'll still love it despite the spoilers as there's so much more to the game than whats on the surface.",1701140735,1701140735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW, FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO THAT.

Rain world is a visually spectacular game with a deep, rich story and a beautiful world full of colorful and diverse creatures. These creatures are both to its benefit, and its downfall. For a player who has an immense amount of experience, the game quickly becomes ""mostly"" manageable. (I'll get more into why ""mostly"" has quotations later.) A new player will find themselves dying over and over and over again with seemingly little to no control over their own fate or outcomes. This is not a good first impression for anyone who seeks to play this game for any extended period, you don't want to give your player a horrible time or they may never come back. With initially awkward controls that are somewhat untraditional for a 2D platformer (not referring to button layout, moreso the controls overall) this will leave many players (myself included) with a sour taste in their mouth. This is the type of game to tell you almost nothing, and expect you to figure things out on your own. For some players, this is great! For players who either lack the time or patience to learn and get over the skill curve, this can quickly lead to refunding the game, or growing so frustrated they never play it again. I initially played when I was much younger, only returning due to my friend asking me to play it again. I had the typical beginner experience, many many deaths and wandering about aimlessly having no idea where I'm supposed to go.

And that's another problem- your only guide, the yellow overseer, can die. If it either dies or you don't realize its signals, you will wander aimlessly having no idea where your intended route is. Furthering this, even once you reach your destination, that's the end of your guidance. You're set loose with no help from the overseer, and magically expected to find your next destination on your own. It's not realistic to expect the player to find 5P without guidance, let alone wander aimlessly for hours. You essentially are required to use a guide and/or map if you are a brand new player, not only because of your extremely unclear objective, but because there is SO MUCH the game doesn't tell you.

A few examples of such mechanics the game says nothing about: slide spearing, rocks cause lizards to flip, vulture masks scare lizards, backflips, slides, slide pounces, rolling, roll chains, deer covet spore puffs, scavengers have a reputation system, lizards have a reputation system and can be tamed, the list goes on and on and on. Some of these you could naturally encounter just via playing the game normally, but some are extremely unrealistic to ever determine on your own. That's why it's so crucial to play with a guide, but that shouldn't ever be necessary.

Onto randomness. The AI in this game does exactly what it intends to do- simulate an ecosystem where every creature has its own thought processes and functions independently of one another, autonomous in behavior and seems almost ""realistic."" While this is extremely successful in its intent, this leaves a somewhat sour player experience given that the player exists at the bottom of said ecosystem, hunted by almost every creature in the game. This is why the new player experience is so punishing- literally everything is out to kill you. Even an experienced player can't win every situation, sometimes you are just guaranteed to die. Yet, despite this, nothing is consistent. Creatures can take any path they want on any given cycle, enemy spawns aren't even the same every cycle, nor are spear/rock spawns, etc. Everything is random and you could literally take the same path twice and encounter no enemies, then almost every single enemy in the region (and predictably, end up dying or being forced to retreat and finding an alternate route.) There are so many deaths that are entirely unpreventable. Scavenger spearing you from 3 screens away, KV coming out of nowhere and spearing you in about ~10 frames, a leviathan deciding to spawn when you thought you were safe, dropwigs camping the beginning of a screen, ANYTHING camping the beginning of a screen, etc etc etc. It's these kinds of deaths that even today, still plague me despite being a significantly more experienced player now. Given that these deaths are almost impossible to prevent, now apply that to a new player and imagine how frequently a new player will die given the simple unfairness of the game. This is by design, of course, you are the bottom of the food chain. I just don't agree that a player should be so helpless without dozens of hours in the game or watching countless guides just to become competent.

I've talked a lot of trash about the game, and I could go on, but I'll refrain for now. I want to address the positives.

I don't even know where to start, really. I love this game as much as I hate it. The story is so compelling and interesting, there's so much to dig into. This game is an absolute masterpiece in environmental storytelling, you can see the world decay around you between every campaign. Every individual character has their own unique endings and story, the creatures have so many unique and intriguing abilities that are fun to interact with if you're good enough to know how to play against them, there's just so much to love. Every room looks stunning and fulfills a purpose in its environment, the music is beautiful and atmospheric, slugcats are just so adorable, there's so much dialogue to uncover between 5P and Moon, I could gush about this game for hours and hours. With how vague the story is, there's much room for headcanons and personal beliefs, making every player's experience special. Personality modifiers ensure no two creatures are ever the same, and function similarly yet have individual preferences. Slugpups are both extremely burdensome, yet so cute that you want to take care of them anyway. Artificer is my favorite, her story is profound and her abilities are likely the most enjoyable thing in the entire game. That said, I'll leave my review here and create a TLDR:

Summary: Play Rain World if you have the time to invest to become a good player and research the game. It is generally unwise to attempt to play this game totally blind, you are better off reading guides or watching videos on where to go in the effort of saving time and not wandering about aimlessly, dying repeatedly to achieve nothing. This game will try your patience, you will hit your desk, you will probably yell at your screen. The game isn't fair, it doesn't want to be, but if you have the patience to take back control (as best you can) and put it in its place, then you can (mostly) do that. I truly love this game, but I cannot recommend it to someone unless they have both an unwavering sense of patience (due to the unfairness, and randomness of the game) and a great deal of time to invest to both uncover the story and become a better player.",1678286645,1700909273,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

with this hands-off approach, rain world allows a rewarding process of discovery...at first. Early in the game, I enjoyed learning the mechanics and unpacking the intricacies of the environment. Twenty hours in, however, the joy of discovery was long faded, replaced by boredom, frustration, and growing apathy. I kept feeling that I wasn't doing what the game wanted me to do - and I kept being right. when the advice for someone in the same situation to me is 'restart the game', there is a problem.

learning I had wasted several hours barking up the wrong tree entirely ruined my desire to experiment. on top of this, i managed to approach every in-game moment from the wrong direction, despite my best intentions, meaning when I eventually found the 'right' direction, all impact and tension was lost. getting things right might be rewarding for those for whom 'getting good' is its own reward, but getting things wrong is so punishing in terms of time and wasted effort, that I lost interest. I stopped having any sense of 'succeeding' - only 'failing to fail'. I googled for help, and got on the right track - but the damage was already done, and the game wasn't out of 'wrong directions' to blunder my way into. as my playtime passed thirty hours, then forty, then fifty, I became exhausted, and impatient for the game to end, and I wasn't able to enjoy the exploration I found.

as a result, my overall experience of rain world was miserable. rain world has a 'right direction' and a 'wrong direction' - which is a fatal flaw in a game about unguided exploration. rain world is a game best played with a veteran friend on-call or an internet tab open, to guide you away from the wrong direction. save yourself. look up a guide.",1700904567,1700904567,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I've played many games before that i mastered, but this game? im 10 hours in and still in the second area, and im loving and hating it and thats why this game is great. 

Controls: very standard controls, easy to remember but hard to actually use to their full potential, and by that i mean its hard to know every single sort of moment tech with just those few controls, it takes a while to figure them out and use them properly.

Difficulty: its rain world what do you expect? game is almost impossible to new players, and the reason critics don't like the game and say its bad is because they haven't beaten it lol

Map: i dont know theres a lot of areas, one areas called sky islands i believe and i explored all of it in like 3 hours, and it isnt very large so..... yeah.... big map!

Fun: the game really helps you see what its like to play a game like a Slugcat (scug) or basically any animal in a world it doesn't understand, you have no knowledge of it till you explore. there's almost no hints besides the little yellow robot (forgot his name) that helps you and the occasional tip screen, it throws you into a bleak dystopian of a world, really helping you know what its like for the slugcat. the trial and error part is great because once you get past the trial after 500 errors it feels amazing. oh, and watch out for the fake poles, they're not funny.

Story: The story is actually surprisingly good and quite easy to understand through just pictures, and explaining your backstory, but your main goal is to ""Ascend"" and get to beat the game by doing this. you'll know you're there when the screen starts being very very very very (you get the idea) very very wavy, or y'know you can just watch the world record speedrun on YouTube....

Overall: this game is amazing and stupendous, as well as heavily underrated. i recommend getting this game heavily as it takes a lot of time and if you need a new game to master, this is it. definitely not for the people prone to raging as uh.... the green lizards when you find them will kill you many... many... many times over. oh and we cant forget the worm grass! im not gonna try to spoil all the animals and storyline, instead of gonna be like Rain World and just give an overview and not explain things very well, so your intrigued to buy the game and figure it out. 

i rate it 15 slug cats out of 2 scavengers. 11/10 help i have an addiction.

sadly 2 hours refund window maybe not enough for some to finally get to the stage which they can truly enjoy this game.
but I still recommend anyone that took interest in the game to buy and try it anyway. if it isn't your taste you can just refund.
I myself still couldn't decide and like I said, 2 hours likely isn't enough. Dev should made demo stage or f2p limited version of some sort to allow people to try learning the game without time limit but rather a stage limit.

If you're willing to fail a lot... I said A LOT, and you have the time to do so, then continue reading.

This game is a simulated ecosystem, where you play as a rodent (commonly referred to by the community as a slugcat (or scug)) in the lower portion of the food web. You are not very important, and have limited abilities when it comes to fighting and movement. The beauty of this game comes in the form of its creature AI, which captures the primal stupidity of real biological creatures such as humans pretty well. The different creatures of this world are (almost) all very deep, and lucky for you, the game doesn't tell you any of it! You're left to figure everything out, which is one of the best and worst things about this game (but, not one of the worst in a bad way. I can't bother to explain too much because I wanna play it!). There's no issue about lengthy dialogue, cutscenes, and the like (not saying there's none of any of these, but none of it is a negative experience while playing the game. You'll have to figure out which of these is in the game).

The game has its issues, but I don't think they take away from the experience if you end up sticking with the game (which is one of the issues: you need to play the game and get decent at the unique bass mechanics before you start getting obsessive joy from it).
That's all. I could go on about the great things stored within, but not only would that spoil you, but it'd keep me from playing the game for more time than I have been resisting already by writing this review.",1700796198,1700796198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rain World is frustrating, agonizing, and sometimes, completely full of BS. You will often be left screaming at your screen, wondering how you were killed by something that wasn't even the frame yet. You will panic and cry out in pain, frustrated that you were just one second away from finding and entering a checkpoint. I know this is the case, because this was me. For my first few playthroughs, I contemplated giving up. The utter frustration at knowing that you on the near bottom of the food chain was almost too much. Despite this, I continued, because despite being angry and upset, I couldn't put the game down. Rain World feels like a game that can only really be enjoyed a second time through, completing the game. I am now a lot more confident in my gaming abilities because I now know what I am doing. Despite this, I do have some criticisms (SPOILERS)
Raindeer: The Raindeer is a deer which is required to beat the game. However, you have little to no way to control it, despite getting a spore-puff thing to control it. Honestly, it's the only part of the game that I actively dislike. 
Softlocking: Rain World measures progression through Karma Gates. Essentially, you have to survive each cycle to boost and maintain your Karma. This is then used to enter sealed gates. Here's the problem. There are certain areas where you will continuously die, and you will try to leave to go back and replenish your Karma, only to realize that you are locked in this difficult area with no way to leave. Sure, you can continue onward and brave the onslaught of tough creatures, but often times, you end up in a cycle. Another instance of soft-locking comes in the far east end of drainage. It's a one way jump, and jumping back will place you in one of the most difficult swimming areas in the entire game. Combine that will a-hole leeches, and it quickly wears you down. Even more experienced players I've seen online get frustrated with the leeches. 
Rain World is not easy, and you will be frustrated. I am glad I stuck with it, however, I can completely understand why others would not.",1700786328,1700786328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played monk for my first run through the hostile world this game revolves around, and despite the lower aggression of enemies, longer cycles, and easier region requirements, every shelter I reached felt like a massive milestone. In the beginning, the base controls are clunky and unpleasant to use, making exploration a slog, and every action something you have to think about for a solid second or two, which in most cases, will mean you've died before you can effectively react. ITS NOT A BUG, ITS A FEATURE!!!!!!! You're SUPPOSED to struggle. You're supposed to get frustrated and unreasonably angry! This game isn't fair but neither is nature. You learn to move and effectively defend yourself, along side your little character! The world is a simulation of nature, life around you goes on, it doesn't care about you or your story, the creatures are all just trying to survive like you are. After all my stumbling, falling, being eaten, drowned, electrocuted, and carried off, I found myself passing by shelters I'd normal dive into, finding more than enough to make friends with creatures that previously pestered me to no ends, and even traversing along side the beasts that would have gladly eaten me for dinner. This is a game of exploration, frustration, accomplishment, sadness, wonder, survival, and determination. I vividly remember how much I struggled, and I'm proud of how far Iv'e come.

no but seriously this game is definitely a fucking labour of love if i ever did see it, the artstyle is really unique in its own way you can literally marvel upon every background you see in each panel. the developer and adult swim as apart of the main game (NOT DOWNPOUR) really put all their effort into this game and it really shows. 

NOW. this game is REALLY FUCKING HARD!!! if you want to RIP OUT YOUR SPINAL CORD at some point in the future then maybe just maybe play one of the many funny dlc slugcats! either or, the game is still really fun in and of itself and it was a hell of a blast to play, i havent even finished like half of the optional stuffs and i have about 120 hours of playtime (as of writing the review.)

i cant stress enough how good this game is, THEY LITERALLY CANONICALLY TURNED ONE OF THE FUNNY IMPORTANT CHARACTERS INTO A CATBOY!!!!!! just play it, nominate it do whatever but id say it was worth ALL of the money i paid for this game. id also recommend getting downpour as it adds like allllot of goodies to the game and i like downpour it funny... also also they have uhm mod support and the modding community is actually really good at modding the game somehow, like adding a sunhat to your slugcat or giving you the ability to throw a bird at a big fish!!

But most of the time that's not the case, and there was some decision that would have allowed you to survive. A lot of skill in rain world is about smart preemptive decision making, and if you analyze your deaths for what you can improve on, you can learn the game.

Something I love about this game is that lots of interactions and the lore are more realistic than you would expect of a game. It really feels like this is a real world.

For most people, I would recommend playing with the rain world remix sort of built in mod, and the tips system enabled. It teaches you a lot of the fundamentals one at a time as you play, but even with that you still need to be compassionate and observant in order to have a smooth experience, and that's part of the appeal of the game.

Basically, this game isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for a game that challenges you to master its tricks rather than just stumbling through, I highly recommend it.",1700741160,1700741562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
312520,135576620,76561198334158924,0,25,10750,8,435,1708178443,"This is an edit of a previously very simple review. I want to preface this by saying that I rarely put the effort or braincells into writing a gramatically and structurally cohesive review like this. This game, however, has had so much heart and soul poured into it that I would feel terrible knowing that I did not fully articulate my thoughts about it. 

Rain World is everything I've ever wanted in a video game's graphics. Wonderful pixel-art, interesting creature designs that produce visually distinct and unique animals, even in the same species. Breathtaking vistas and graphical fidelity in even the smallest of details. Everything in Rain World's visuals comes toghether to create a cohesive and immersive whole. There is nothing that I would criticize in this aspect.

The AI of the creatures that inhabit Rain World's many regions is complex, but logical. While it has its quirks, you can expect the animals to act just like an animal would. Predators will hunt prey and prey will run from them. Neutral creatures will wander around, and more complex beings will react to how you treat them. When approached as a video game enemy or an obstacle, these creatures become utterly unpredictable and impossible to defeat or sneak by. When approached as wild animals, their behavior is absolutely logical and the player can distract or defeat them in a myriad of ways. 

The controls are obtuse, unintuitive and take a long time to learn. Would I criticize this, then? Absolutely not. The immense satisfaction you get from chaining toghether advanced movement is fully worth the time invested into learning the ins and outs of this game's control system. They open up a lot of different and innovative ways to traverse the environment and evade predators.

Items are similiar to the movement system: completely unexplained by the game. You are shown food, and told to eat it. That is one item. There are many more, and upon encountering them you are simply told to ""experiment"". And that is exactly what I did. The process of discovery is satisfying and fun. Items rarely have immediately apparent uses. Again, there is nothing I would criticize.

Rain World has no conventional systems for progress. Death is not an obstacle, but a certainty that will occur sooner or later. Death however, has little bearing on the actual gameplay. The player character has no levels, no skills to learn, no upgrades. While I often see this game described as a metroidvania, it is anything but. The progression through the game's regions is completely nonlinear and the player can choose to wander into any of them in any order and at any time they please. Their progress is limited only by their skill and knowledge of each area. Rain World does not punish the player for dying, as each time a death occurs the player is simply sent back a ""karma level"". These are needed to open gates to regions, but karma can be gained as quickly as it is lost. The rain itself is an ever-looming threat, but with planning and thought out routes, a player can complete the entire game without seeing the rain once. As the player learns and improves at the game, so does the main protagonist. The slugcat is not so much a player-controlled creature as it is an extension of the player, bearing all of their imperfections, but also all of their skills.

Now, for the story. I have never, in my many years of playing video games, found a piece of art that spoke to me on the same level as Rain World's story did. The little dialogue you are given is very well written, and conveys an incredibly powerful message. I cannot state the importance this message has had on me as a person, it is beautiful, thought-provoking, and effective. The narrative is tied directly into the world itself, and even the game's title is part of it. Everything, again, forms a cohesive whole, and again, I have no criticism towards any part of it.

Rain World is not a game, but rather an experience. I know this very statement gets thrown around a lot in the industry, but I fully mean it. Nothing I experienced while playing a video game has come close. Not to say the artistry in the works that are often brought up in the ""games as an artform"" argument is invalid or ineffective, Rain World simply offers a fusion of both art and interactive media, delivers on what it sets out to do, and what is most important in a video game: it's just fun to mess around in.

Is it for everyone? No. Will every player get the same level of enjoyment I get out of playing Rain World? Also no. But if you are a person willing to spend time and effort learning something new, using the knowledge you learned and then willing to wait for your reward, then I wholeheartedly recommend Rain World.

If I were to condense my feelings on it into one single sentence, I would only say this;

This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm doubtful anything similar will ever top it. If you're thinking about getting this game, note that the Downpour DLC is a must-have; the base game is great, but the DLC has more content than the game itself and is what makes it so phenomenal.

PROS:

Simplicity - Unlike most survival games, there's no inventory or crafting system. What you're carrying in your two hands is what you get. The only thing you have to manage is eating enough food between rain cycles so that you can hibernate. There's a lot of versatility and subtlety in using the items you collect, which you gradually pick up on as you play.

Enemy Design - The best thing about the game is the complex ecosystem, where enemies interact with the player and with each-other in simple yet complicated and unpredictable ways. Even the basic lizard enemy that you first encounter has a lot of depth to it's behavior; it will chase you, sure, but will often get distracted fighting with other lizards, giving you a much easier time sneaking by. There's too much to talk about here, but enemy AI has never been better in any other game.

Music - The music of Rain World is fantastic.

Story-Telling - Rain World has a unique and compelling plot, and does a better job with atmospheric story-telling than any other game I've played. This is increased a hundredfold by the Downpour DLC. 

Exploration - The Rain World map is absolutely gigantic; even after 80 hours of playing, there's still an entire area I've left practically unexplored.

CONS:

Difficulty - Rain World leaves the player to stumble around in the dark. Learning how to deal with all the hostile creatures takes a lot of patience, and dying can be extremely punishing. This isn't a bad thing for me personally, but I don't think this game is for everyone.

No Direction - Rain World gives the player very little instruction on where to go or how to progress, and you can spend hours exploring areas without feeling like you've gotten any farther in the game. This caused me to quit the game early on, eventually coming back to it and restarting. This isn't really a bad thing either, because it makes certain moments of the game much more powerful when you finally get to them, but if you're looking for a game to give you instruction on what to do, you won't find it playing Rain World.",1700668559,1700668559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You aren't necessarily at the top of the food chain in this world, and you certainly begin to feel that after the first twenty or so times you get eaten by something much larger than you.

This game has an rather large world to explore and a story to learn about if you look for it. Each playable character (save for Monk and Survivor mostly) are unique in their abilities and campaigns, allowing for unique experiences depending on the character you select.
There are also a handful of collectables placed around the world, giving an incentive to venture out into the far reaches of each region you come across. Finding these collectables allows you to access more items in the sandbox and arena modes the game features, where you can spawn in the various creatures and items in the game to play around with at your own pace. 
In the Downpour DLC, there are also custom-built challenges created for each playable character, along with an ""Expedition"" gamemode, which has you embark on short journeys in the game world while completing randomly generated challenges for points. 
All these sandbox gamemodes and the story mode itself give the game a great deal of replay value.

Something to keep in mind: Rain World is a challenging game. You will likely spend a lot of time getting lost and dying in the first few hours of gameplay as you learn of the game's systems and controls. 

If you can get past the harsh learning experience that is the first few hours, you are in for a truly special experience with a unique art style, an immersive interconnected open world, and a great soundtrack to boot.

Also it gives some creepy vibe that youre just a small animal trying to survive in a weird and hostile enviroment where anything and literally everything wants to kill you, similar to hollow knight but in hollow knight you can swing your weapon to hit anyone with bad intentions, this one NOT, you have only spears and rocks to throw against pretadors (cherrybombs too but thats endgame) basicly you are totally vulnerable without these, relying only at your skill at the game.
At first sight i felt like exploring some vast and misterious ambient just like hollow knight, but this one was different, i got lost often and just decided to wander around and ended restarting the game because i got to a point where i thought i couldn't return (that totally ruined my experience) but eventually i did finished it. My thoughts at the ending was a mix of amazement,happiness and total confusion (im talking about void sea trippy effect). After some time playing the game i really wanted to criticize it heavily because of the difficulty but its art and kinda charismatic protagonist(even tho i rage at him alot because of his lack of coordination) makes me reconsider it, BUT you will agree with me that seeing something precious that could easily be your pet getting bitten by a dropping from the sky cyan lizard or being shot by a king vulture in 2 seconds after it appears actually is enough to damage your sanity and well being.
The music is pretty much a alarming sense that tells you if you are in danger or not, even tho some sounds are awesome like floes and bio engineering for example.
The artwork is like hollow knight style but some backgrounds are even delightful to see, and it looks almost real.
Lore is scattered in pearls so you have to find them and bring to a robot at the edge of the world, pretty much okey but hollow knight lore is way better.
Gameplay is dark souls like but eventually you get over it.
Heres the only thing i didnt like in this game, Hunter mode.
I understand you want to challenge players but this is total insanity, You have around 20 cycles to do 2 quests that take you very far(not required to win) and remember that everything wants to kill survivor? this time nature itself found a way of producing mass weapons of destruction to go after you while you struggle to catch 30 seconds of peace. Everyone literally wants YOU dead, i mean, you can still befriend scavengers but they can't protect you much because you will be fighting literal warmachines (don't agree with me? try fighting a king vulture, or a red centipede, or even worse, red lizard)
after several frustrated hunter runs i decided to stop playing the game until downpour is released to avoid damaging my mental health.

After the Downpour update the game got 3x better and more interesting(new slugs,regions,creatures etc. And gets even better with mods) so i decided that it will now have the highest note ever!

Either way there are still some situations where deaths can be really unfair. As an example, some rooms are divided into multiple screens because of their size, and to switch screens you have to go close to the edge of one screen. The predator AI is constantly working, even off-screen, and sometimes it can happen that enemies attack you from another screen when near the edge of a screen, which will most likely result in your death. Adding camera scrolling would fix that issue. 


But if you have trouble, you can also play as the Monk (basically easy mode). But dying is part of the game, and I completed my first run as the Survivor. 


The predator AI is really well made. They can make mistakes just like the player and predict where the player could go once they move out of their sight. 
And scavengers have by far the best AI in the game, they can communicate with gestures and show emotions like fear. They have their own reputation system with the player. They even have different personalities. 


The art style of the game looks beautiful. The lore is interesting and creative. I really liked it. I also really liked the soundtrack. Every area (except subareas) gets its own Threat Song, which makes each area even more unique. And they even have multiple layers that increase when the threat increases. But the atmospheric songs are amazing as well. 


If you don't like difficult games, you shouldn't play Rain World because you will die a lot.

You can even get predators to chase after you, goading them by getting up in their space or positioning yourself in an easy to escape position (more or less... I've failed on more than one occasion).

Well sometimes, like many predators, they don't actually want to eat you just yet, but well, there is a big ambush predator in your way, and you don't want to be the one eaten.

I've seen negative reviews on this game saying that the enemies aren't staying on path and they are always somewhere different or maybe the controls are bad and who could possibly forget THIS GAME TELLS YOU NOTHING. All of this is true but, I think if you checked what you were getting into and you knew the goal of the game then it wouldn't be so bad. If you don't know this game is a game that simulates a living ecosystem in a dying world. You are not important because you are only a part of this ecosystem. This is why the creatures of Rain World can move even off screen and do (almost) whatever they want. This game also gives them the ability to control their own movements with procedural animation. Basically it makes them control their limbs and make the limbs move however they want so, that it pushes itself from point A to point B. This makes it even harder to predict your enemy. I'm no expert on this topic so if you want to actually know how this works watch a video about it. Your character is procedurally animated too so expect lots of cool movements based on how you move your arrow keys. The controls are difficult to get the hang of. This is because the creature you play as is learning how to live without family guidance. you will most likely get used to it and if you look back actually good at it. Once I got eaten by a blue lizard the actual easiest predator in the game. Now I killed a red lizard one of the most difficult lizard in the game. 






Finally lets talk about difficulty...



 Imagine the hardest game you have ever played
times it by 10 and then add a hint of impossible to escape moments.
Yes there is parts of the game that are not fair and unexpected, But is life fair?

You've worked so hard to get here-- was it worth it? Does that question even mean anything, considering here isn't anywhere special at all and an experience being worth anything is a ridiculous concept anyways?

The experience of Rain World is deeply allegorical. 

Sometimes a blow is too much, a failure too humiliating, that you make that judgement call. Its not worth it anymore. You try in vain for any glimpse of the goal that you assume is out there, but all you see is overcast skies and empty black tunnels. There is no guide, there are no rails, so for all you know the path you're treading leads nowhere at all.

Succeeding in Rain World requires you to realize a new perspective on the worth of experience.

- Poor platforming: crouch jumps will only work about half of the time, with no rhyme or reason.  Jumping between adjacent walls to go up - also only randomly effective.  And when trying to climb a ladder? This is the only game I've seen where the character gets hung up on the sides of the ladder!  Awful stuff.
- No scrolling: An unforgivable design choice in an unforgiving game.  This could prevent so many accidental deaths of walking into an enemy simply because it is one screen over.  
- Inconsistency: You won't die if you and an enemy are going through the same 'dashed line' pipe.  You will die if you are going through the same 'sideless' pipe.  Why? I don't know.

TLDR: game is very good but very hard (particularly to begin with)

Rain world has one of the most incredible and dynamic ecosystems in any game, the AI is simple code wise and yet unmatched (even with a couple of less favourable examples) in its overall interconnecting realism and complexity. the game really is an ecosystem on its own that you are just living in.

The combat is brilliantly handled, with the player being one effectively one shot to anything yet able to dish out some violence in return. This is an ecosystem and you are at the bottom of the food chain.

The DLC is massive and like a whole game with the amount of content it adds, definitely get that with the base game if you like rain world sounds.

The lore is fascinating and intricate although you will likely only see the surface in the average run.

The difficulty is a turn off for many people and if you struggle with hard games you may not like it. Although the feeling of reward when you do eventually learn the game  is amazing. People complain about the RNG which is somewhat fair but since its basically an ecosystem simulator on top of a game it should be expected, you cant anticipate what another animal should do so the game doesn't let you.

The art style if beautiful, sound/music is great and used sparingly keeping it fresh and maintaining the perfect atmosphere and level design is phenomenal (although not quite perfect) the stages are designed around parkour combat and exploration with easier but longer roots for less daring players and run around to avoid the ecosystem doing its thing and blocking your path from one way. 

Personally ive never had an issue with reindeer yet but from what ive heard and seen they are quite buggy but not as big a deal as people make them out to be.

Overall this game is a rewarding, skilful and unique; definitely give it a try. not necessary the right game for the plebs who struggle to play hard games.

     There are plenty of games out there that are fun. There are plenty that are visually breathtaking or challenge players’ skills. But it is only the very best ones that create their own entire experience. Rain World, is an excellent example of this. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it achieves this unique experience with a vast, interesting world, lots of mechanical depth, and an incredibly immersive atmosphere.

     In Rain World, the player plays as a ""slugcat,"" an aptly named creature that seems to resemble both a slug and a cat. The player jumps, crawls, hides, gathers food, and hunts in a vast, two dimensional world, exploring every unique corner of a diverse ecosystem on an alien planet, all while avoiding a frequent, deadly downpour. This world contains all sorts of odd, sometimes seemingly impossible creatures, which interact not only with the player but with each other inside of an elaborate, simulated ecosystem, in which the player is but a small part of. However, slugcats sit rather low on the food chain in this ecosystem, and often find themselves being hunted by terrifying, ravenous predators. The player must quickly learn to survive in this world by gathering enough food, avoiding predators, and most importantly, not getting caught in the rain.

	One of the things that makes Rain World unique is the natural way that it lets players learn. Instead of shoving wordy tutorial messages in the player’s face or starting out with lengthy and obnoxiously easy challenges, Rain World throws the player straight into the deep end of the pool, and leaves them to learn how to swim on their own. At the beginning of the game, it shows the player the basic controls and other fundamental mechanics of the game, but then immediately sets the player free to explore. The player will probably die countless times throughout their journey, but every time they do they can use that experience to survive the next time they are in a similar situation. While playing this game, the player really feels like they are learning to survive on their own in an unfamiliar world using tricks, exploits, and strategies that they come up with completely on their own. For example, after getting eaten by a ferocious lizard the first couple of times, the player might eventually notice that the lizards are not capable of climbing poles. They can then use this knowledge to easily stay well away from the jaws of the beast, and live for another day. This kind of process happens frequently across all kinds of different situations throughout the entire game.

	Another reason Rain World is so interesting is because of the incredibly in-depth ecosystem that it simulates. Every single creature the player encounters in this game has its own survival in mind, its own encounters with other creatures, and sometimes even a unique personality. Unlike other games where everything revolves around the player, the player is only a small part of this vast ecosystem. To demonstrate that the player is really not the main character of this universe, a lizard which has caught the player might get distracted by another lizard, which it decides to fight over territory with, losing interest in the player. Additionally, the game keeps track of and simulates all of the creatures in a wide area, allowing all kinds of interactions amongst the wildlife to happen constantly regardless of whether or not they are being observed by the player. This results in the player often walking into situations happening between other creatures that they aren’t even involved in, which helps make the world seem so much more lively. 

	The AI’s of the creatures in this game are also quite realistic. Lizards hunting for food will wander around, investigating small noises they hear, and give chase only when they spot something with their limited vision. Giant Vultures will swoop down upon unsuspecting prey, only to fly off frustrated when their prey hides out of reach. The most notable example of this game’s intricate AI systems are the Scavengers, which are monkey-like creatures that live in tribes across the map. Individual Scavengers have unique personalities, remember the player’s actions with a reputation system, demonstrate emotion, and even communicate with the player using body language.  These kinds of deep systems and mechanics not only breathe more life into the game, but also keep the game feeling fresh later on, since it gives the player more advanced systems to learn about and use to their advantage.

	One of the greatest things about Rain World is the incredible sense of atmosphere it creates. From the soft sound of dripping water after a fresh rain cycle to the faint chirping of small insects in the background to the distant whirring of ancient machines, there are so many small details in the world’s ambient sound design that makes players feel like they are really in the world themselves. There are also many visual elements, such as colorful rainbows, foggy landscapes in the background, or cascading shadows cast from clouds rolling by, that further contribute to allowing the player to become immersed in the world. 

	Adding to the atmosphere is the game’s music, or lack thereof. The player will spend much of their time accompanied by no music at all, creating a lonely and sometimes unsettling feeling. But, during key moments of the game, various types of songs do play, like the hollow, lonely song that plays when you first open the game, the percussive and suspenseful music that plays when in danger, or the ominous, ancient hymns that play at mysterious locations. Perhaps the most important aspect of the atmosphere, however, is the game’s story and the player’s journey itself. The game’s story is a tragic tale about the protagonist slugcat being separated from their family at a young age, losing all hope of returning, and searching for a new purpose. This story is reflected quite well in the game’s depressing, lonely, and desperate atmosphere.

	However, Rain World is certainly not flawless. One common criticism of the game is that controlling the slugcat feels rather “sluggish” and imprecise. While this may feel like the case at first, it really just takes some practice. After spending enough time learning and mastering the controls, it starts to make sense, and players are able to move more deliberately, with precision, and much more swiftly. Some people also don’t like the lack of guidance and the openness of the game, which admittedly does sometimes lead to new players winding up stuck in extremely difficult sections of the game they weren’t intended to be in yet. This is certainly an issue, but the game does use multiple methods that attempt to subtly steer the player back on track, so these cases are somewhat rare. Finally, the main issue that many people have with this game is with the sheer difficulty, and how cruel and punishing this game can sometimes be. When playing through the game for the first time, many players will find the game overly difficult and frustrating, not enjoying this type of extreme challenge at all. But this is simply just how the game is. While some are willing to push through the steep learning curve to experience the joy of mastering this game, most are, understandably, not.

	Despite its flaws, Rain World’s unique, immersive style of gameplay and story create not just a game, but an incredible, unique experience for some people, a journey which will be looked back upon fondly. However, its harsh and cruel nature will make it less than enjoyable for everyone else. So, while Rain World is certainly not a game for everyone, it is an incredible experience that is worth every minute of its time for those it does resonate with.",1699871588,1699871880,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I straight up don't recommend this game to you if you aren't planning to look things up or discuss the game with friends who know about it. The game has a tiny tutorial and complicated movement mechanics so feel free to look things up and DO NOT feel bad about it. The Rainworld Wiki is great for at least getting a basic idea of what locations to go next and what items do (and what controls to use them). 

If you play blind, you'll may get frustrated by how unfair the game is (it is unfair, the developers were more focused on simulating an ecosystem than making a balanced game) and you won't know where to go to progress, let alone how to use items like spore puffs or grappling worms.

Another thing: you can get mods and still get achievements, so you can play the game with all the QOL you want and not get punished (like SBCameraScroll if you want the camera to follow you). Alternatively, you can download Rotund World and become morbidly a beast.

When i first heard of this game, it was from a YT vid (thanks Skurry and Daszombes for showing me this) and it seemed fun so i bought it expecting to beat it in like a week max. I was immediately humbled since i couldn't even get past the first gate as monk, and stopped playing for like a month. Then i saw the YT vids again and i tried again. Since i watched the videos i knew what to do now, and made it about midway where i'm now. It was so much fun. Fighting lizards and avoiding DLLs usin grapple worms. And the mobs are so well programed that it really feels like watching real animals. Esspecialy the scavengers, i love them. Also the Iterators are so cool, really the lore of this game is only topped by FnaF lore, Hollow Knight lore. As for games, it's probably only topped by Hollow Knight, Celeste, Deltarune/Undertale and CS.

It'll be frustrating and you'll ragequit, but as long as you keep coming back, eventually the game will click. Maybe it'll happen after fifty hours, maybe after a hundred, maybe two hundred, but eventually it'll click. The game also has story-based achievements, and only 13% of users have the achievement you get for reaching the half-way point. That's because most people never reach that second stage. I went in blind as the reviews said, got frustrated and ragequit as they predicted, but frankly I don't have the time to spend dozens if not hundreds of hours just to figure out the basic mechanics through trial and error, so I went ahead and read some of the articles on the wiki. I'm glad I did. I went back to the game after reading the wiki, had a great time and beat it, and I want to do a second playthrough later.

The frustration that comes with playing Rain World is twofold. The first reason for it is mechanical. It's a tough platformer. You die constantly, and a lot of the deaths are to RNG. However the second and more important reason is that the game is deliberately obscure. It tells you (almost) nothing. It doesn't even tell you you have a [spoiler]health bar[/spoiler]. When you start a new game, it doesn't tell you that ""monk"" is [spoiler]easy mode[/spoiler] and ""surivor"" is [spoiler]normal[/spoiler]. It doesn't tell you what moves you can do or how many items are edible. I'm sure it's mind-blowing playing this game for dozens of hours and then realizing you have a [spoiler]slide move[/spoiler], but I'd rather be told this information up front. The game is hard enough without requiring you to guess basic mechanics.

Once you have the basic gameplay information, Rain World turns into something more like a conventional metroidvania. You can go anywhere and gain access to new areas by picking up helpful items. You can lose those items again, but you need to bring a light if you're going into a dark area, things like that, so some routes through the game world are impractical. It's not a typical metroidvania for sure, but once you actually understand the mechanics, the game turns out to be much less strange than it seems at first. You jump on platforms, you fend off enemies, pick up health. You go from point A to point B to C, then the credits roll. The game world simulates an ecology, which is neat, but from the player's perspective it's only the deliberate obscuring of the mechanics that prevents you from playing it like (mostly) any other tough platformer with realistic-ish physics.

If you already know you're one of those <13% of players who don't mind ragequitting, coming back, ragequitting, coming back, etc., for dozens or hundreds of hours before you get it, by all means try it blind. If you're more like me, I'd really recommend reading the wiki before you ragequit and uninstall. You don't have to read any story spoilers, they all have big warning labels on them. Just read the page on the controls and some basic stuff like how hibernation and feeding work. My own frustration (mostly) went away at that point. I still died all the time, but now I didn't mind so much because I understood why.

The game looks great. I kept thinking of the game Another World in terms of the esthetics. It sounds great too, all moody background noise and drones with some minimalist music here and there. The atmosphere in general is spot-on. The enemy designs are cool and otherworldly. The world-building is consistent and well-done. The game even makes you feel for the couple of NPCs you come across. I played with a PS4 controller, which worked fine most of the time, but I found it very difficult to get the timing down on extended sections of wall-jumping, so I had to switch over to keyboard for these parts. On keyboard it was no problem. You can switch back and forth seamlessly between controller and keyboard, so you don't have to commit when you start. I played on Proton, and it seemed to run really well.",1699203308,1699203308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can comfortably say that beating Rain World is one of my most prized accomplishments when it comes to gaming. Not only because it's very difficult in a refreshingly unique way - more on that later - but also because the [i]spiritual significance[/i] of the game, the ending in particular, left an ever-aching scar on my heart that refuses to heal even years later.

There's this general belief that game journalists suck at games; I don't want to get into that right now, but I honestly believe that Rain World simply blindsided a lot of its more mainstream reviewers with its unconventional control scheme and strange, dynamic difficulty. This isn't a 2D platformer. The slugcat cannot really jump like we're used to; instead, it has a handy set of other movement abilities, and learning them in spite of your instincts is required to get anywhere.

And this is on top of the other unusual design choices. The world is incredibly interconnected and if you're persistent enough, there's nothing really preventing you from doing stuff out of order and even skipping a lot of the game. No worries though - the chances of you doing that on accident are very low.

What really makes Rain World shine, however, is the way its difficulty works. Almost all hard games can be learned, and that's what you're expected to do. Learn the steps and execute the dance. But Rain World shuffles things up every time you die. Enemies appear in different locations. A route you took last time might be inaccessible this time around due to a bunch of lizards fighting for turf. Sure, you could try sneaking past. Or even fighting them. But as a general rule you're not a fighter; you have to use a mixture of trickery, stealth, being quick on your feet and occasional violence to get by.

In other words, you're squarely in the lower half of the food chain. Yes, there are creatures that are below you that you can hunt and consume, but most things want to make a snack of you instead. And they will. Oh yes, they will.

The most memorable and glorious moments of the game will be where you will have barely escaped with your life over and over again in a single cycle and miraculously managed to find shelter just before the rain came. And as you start to really understand the workings of the world and the abilities of your slugcat, moments such as those will come more and more often. That's its true power.

On top of all that, Rain World has a spiritual component - one that is not immediately clear, but as you keep playing, you'll begin the true significance of a lot of stuff. I don't think it's practical to completely unravel the plot by yourself due to the insane things you need to do to get some pieces of info, though; I had to consult the wiki to really understand. But it's fine - you'll still get a very satisfying and emotional experience if you go only with what you can find by yourself.

And above all else - it's a very, very unique game, even by indie standards. Difficult, yes. But possible to learn and to master. Complex. Obtuse, perhaps; but so incredibly satisfying. Not for everyone, for sure - and yet, I implore you to check it out. I'm incredibly grateful to the Universe that I did and refused to give up.

When playing Rain World, you are but a delicious, savory slug cat in an ecosystem where nearly everything is either predator or prey. Your rank in the food chain is laughably low, and the game makes sure you understand this very early on. The reason why most players drop Rain World after only a few hours is because the gameplay feels unrewarding, directionless and unreasonably punishing. Just like real life.
 
Being driven away by these factors early on is entirely understandable, as even those who are dead set on seeing the game through to the end will be forced to take things slow. Only through careful observation, methodical exploration and an ungodly amount of patience will you persevere in Rain World's oppressive ecosystem. There are no upgrades or special moves to unlock. Your only ally is the intricate knowledge of the game's systems that you will gain gradually, after many hours of trial and error. The Downpour DLC sort of flips this dynamic on its head in favor of a more conventionally fun gameplay loop fueled by the new characters' wacky abilities. But that doesn't mean the game becomes a cakewalk. In fact, with the downpour slug cats, so many new sources of danger come into play that they often outweigh the benefits of having character-specific attributes, making the experience somehow even more excruciatingly stressful. I love it.

So then, what does one get out of playing Rain World besides unspeakable levels of humbleness and a head full of gray hairs? The ultimate kind of immersion. Rain World is as close as one can get to truly FEELING like a helpless creature in the treacherous wilderness. This feeling is elevated even further by the game's absolutely gorgeous environments and soundtrack. All of these elements combined secure Rain World's place as one of, if not THE most jaw-droppingly atmospheric game ever created. And then there's the story.   

Each character has their own unique little plot line designed to get the player to care about them. Besides having their personal quest, every slug cat plays a role in the game's overarching story about a world left behind by an advanced civilization and its progressive decay. Environmental storytelling is a core aspect of Rain World and there are times when a mere glimpse of the scenery is enough to let the player know that things have taken a turn for the worse in-between different slug cats' playthroughs. Many such deeply affecting moments are present throughout all campaigns and, together with the pieces of lore scattered throughout the world in the form of data pearls, they make for an exceedingly compelling narrative.

The best way to experience Rain World is by going in as clueless as possible, although I don't blame anyone who turns to the wiki for help along their journey as I'm guilty of doing it myself. It's fine if you desperately need guidance and are unwilling to spend the next 3 hours trying to figure out where you're supposed to go, just note that the experience will have a much greater impact on you if you slowly figure stuff out for yourself.

In a nutshell, playing Rain World is like watching your favorite show while getting kicked in the nuts. The kicks just keep coming. One day you will have taken so many kicks to the nuts that you'll stop feeling your nuts. But you'll still be getting kicked in the nuts. And then eventually you'll come to realize that the kicks to the nuts serve to enhance the viewing experience. Every kick to the nuts will make you notice new subtleties and nuances of your favorite show that you had previously been unaware of even after hundreds of rewatches. You will never be able to watch it again without having 10 kicks administered to your nuts every second. It would all feel so bland in their absence.",1693157599,1698868443,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The beautifully crafted landscapes, the surprisingly in depth movement system, the music that I can't ever seem to get enough off and the unforgiving yet satisfying reward of dominating the food chain. It's great.

This game is by no means easy, it shows you the bare minimum at the start and pretty much expects you to learn everything about the ecosystem that you are now suddenly part of and you will undoubtedly become a lizards lunch a good amount of times. You will likely end up feeling very lost at the start too, you aren't given a clear objective of where to go apart from a Yellow Overseer following you around pointing out various things about the environment you are in which at times can seemingly make you go back from where you just came. Because of this you can quite easily end up in a very difficult area which is honestly something that could be improved slightly to dissuade inexperienced players or at least give an idea of what to expect before essentially soft locking themselves. If I was to give any advice to new players for a slightly more enjoyable experience, head up and right at the start of the game.

The creatures of Rain World are often brought up in discussion as the way everything interacts creates a world that feels very real. One experience with a certain creature may differ greatly from each individual making you uncertain if you can repeat the same strategy on it for an easy victory. For example the Green Lizards, you may find one that is very lazy almost making no attempt at catching you, simply biting the air in your general direction when you are close. On the flip side you may get one that doesn't seem to give up chase and lunges at you much more motivated to get it's next meal. You can never quite be sure. (Can't say the same for Reds, They want you dead.)

I would talk about the scavs but honestly they have such a complex system that I don't think I can even begin to explain how real they feel at times. (minus the questionable reaction times that will never feel fair.) All I will say about them is try not to give them a reason to kill you.

I could honestly go on about how much I love about this game for ages. It's one of the games that I plan to eventually 100% (not doing that achievement it's too mean) but if you read this along side the thousands of over reviews that have likely talked about what I have not and are still interested in getting this game, you absolutely should!

    It has 3 campaigns (9 with the Downpour DLC) that are chock full of 12+ colorful regions with stunning scenery and incredibly relaxing (at least, to me) music, along with wonderful (and sometimes scary!) creatures, ranging from the small, scared lantern mice, to the giant towering iterator superstructures that the game takes place in and around (yes, they're alive!). There is so much lore to discover along with a wonderfully advanced and diverse ecosystem!! 
    I could go on for HOURS about this game (and have), but i think it'd be best to discover all of the different mechanics and each of the creatures and their strange habits on your own!!

You control the unenviable after they are separated from their family and habitat by a rain storm, washing them through a labyrinth of still-functioning infrastructure that fights against the reclamation of nature.   
You don't know where you are, you don't know how to get back, and the strange yellow creature that greets you after you gain control gives you scarce, fleeting advice before you're eaten by a hissing green monster. 
... then you try again.  

The gameplay loop has you learning a deceptively simple three-button control scheme as you struggle to feed yourself, hibernate, and progress a mysterious counter that seems to gate your progress through the game; You'll quickly begin to appreciate that while survival for the regrettable slugcat is harsh, the world isn't about you- The meticulously detailed and foreign environments you traverse feature functional ecosystems that you are merely a conveniently sized snack for, not an explicit target. 

This is where the game can be polarizing. It's very old-school in it's design and is, as the kids say, ""Nintendo Hard"". It's design philosophy of tossing you into an alien world and leaving you to learn it's rules extends from the more advanced movement techniques to unclear UI elements. You do get a guide that will attempt to point you in the right direction, but they are driven by procedural behaviors and can be inconsistent at best. 
I do respect that some folks won't enjoy this game, but for anyone that is shying away at my previous description: Just wait a moment-

The difficulty is important. 

I won't tell you that you MUST play this game regardless of your personal tastes, but if you can pay out the patience the game demands, it will absolutely pay you back. 
Rain World is a game with a very carefully crafted narrative and intent to its environmental story-telling, with moments and revelations that still to this day give me chills and make me tear up a bit; And that's not including the Downpour DLC.  

If you still want the story without the difficulty, the game has always had mods and now includes official quality of life features to adjust it as you need.

If you want a classic styled cinematic platformer with a rich cast of creatures that simulate a fascinating ecosystem, absolutely, cannot recommend enough. 
If you want a deeply introspective and surprisingly philosophical story that thrives on your actual struggles as a player, this game will live in your head for decades to come. 

Oh and there's official co-op support. Just be sure to go through the effort of setting up Parsec (and maybe reWASD for sharing keyboard inputs) as my experience with Steam Remote Play is... inconsistent. 

For any of my friends I forced to play this game: I'm not sorry :)

Mods - easy to install. no issues.

Controls - bad. very bad. mods make them good though.

This is a good game.

It is the mods that make this game playable, but oh is it a fantastic game once you have them.


On Switch I would strongly NOT recommend the game. 
- Needs Pearlcat. This is Essential. (Radically changes the game into pure fun)
- Needs Similar
- Needs Wingcat
- Needs Outsider
- Needs Teleport to Regional Map Cell (forgot the name of this mod). This is essential. 
- Needs many of the player-made regions 
- Needs the ability to design your own cat . This is essential.
- Needs VERY MUCH keybinds. This is essential.. 
Without these the game is NOT worth the time to play it (in my opinion). With these
- This game on Switch has controls are deranged. That's being kind to it. Less kind things could be said and be equally as accurate or more so.",1698051119,1698489663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is so much content in this game that you never stop being surprised and entertained.  One thing I never hear anyone say about this game is just how absolutely terrifying it is.  Maybe it's just me being afraid of bugs, but every single thing in this game had me on the pause screen considering just alt+f4ing out of fear (especially the stupid spiders ahhhyerfgeayfeas8rg).  However, all that did was make the reward of making it through an area 100 times more rewarding.  I really feel like I got to truly face and overcome my fears.  If you are arachnophobic you might just never beat this game if you can't muster up the courage to unpause the game and fight those spiders.  If you like a challenge then buy this game for sure, it has hard to master platforming and hard to master combat, and once you get good at them you really start to feel like a badass.  The feeling of outmaneuvering multiple apex predators using nothing but a rock and a couple backflips is a rush.  The main gripe I had with the game was just how little direction it gives.  I understand that it is a part of the experience to figure things out, but there are so many times in the game that if I hadn't looked something up I would have never found out that it exists.  I'm sure that you can beat the game without looking anything up, especially if you aren't afraid of fully exploring the more scary areas of the game.  But if you played Hollow Knight and thought that it didn't have enough direction, just know that this game has even less.  But I still recommend it, amazing soundtrack and visuals, difficult and fun to learn gameplay, and a story that keeps me up at night just thinking about it.

In detail, the movement is quite good and the combat feels nice. Therefore, I am more referring to the player input as Rain World really struggles with that. I am coming from a keyboard which might mean this isn't a problem on gamepads but, whenever you need to interact with some kind of vertical platforming everything falls apart. 
I wanna start with the good things because it's important to understand why this major flaw nullifies every system and makes it impossible to enjoy the game. 

The environment, music and creatures are really well done. You wanna get lost in this world and explore it. I felt the strong urge to sink many hours into this game and all of its components work beautifully together to invoke that feeling. The little encouncters, how enemies and other bugs interact with each other and the soundscape are magnificent to create this dystopian place you survive in. Art design in particular is some of Rain World's strongest bits. Hence why it's so frustrating that it's impossible to stay immersed.

The problem really lies within how either the maps are designed or how controls are handeld. One of these systems kind of create this tragedy.

You see, a perfect example is when the environment slowly starts to shake, the rain is coming and the suspense start rising. You are jumping from platform to platform and the whole progress you made that day is almost finished. All you need to do is make your way back which you've prepared in advance by remembering the route and therefore you're certain that it's easy. But then you encounter a horizontal pipe leading to a smaller horizontal pipe above you inbetween two stones. One of those stones has a vertical pipe. You need to press spacebar to jump and then w to grab the pipe above you. Sadly when you do that your slugcat instantly gravitates towards the vertical pipe next to it and then grabs it. You then need to press space again to let go of it and reset the position a couple of times but by then the rain killed you already because it kept teleporting you again and again for like 10 times. Looking at you pipeyard.

Another instance is when you slept in a dead-end like the garbage wastes and need to do a climbing action on a rather tall wall. Spacebar is also the same input for crawling that last bit of a wall and the walljump which frustrates when you are trying to get over it and you don't have the space to do a backflip or throw-jump so your slugcat is just constantly walljumping until it works after the 5th or 6th try. 

Especially climbing pipes after a walljump is something that just works on a coinflip. Regardless of pressing w your slugcat refuses to grab it and falls into its death. 

Which leads me to the conclusion that the map design is either bad and shouldn't have these types of platforming sections or the controls on keyboard need a giant improvement. Because of this all of your immersion just goes down the drain, your day progress gets resetted and it stops sucking you into its world. 
I played for around 12 hours and tried again and again to love this game. And I actually like everything about it but this flaw makes it impossible to play the campaign when you regularly get stuck in situations mentioned above for minutes at a time until some creature just kills you or you fall into your death without even doing the input. 

The remix improvement were turned on and I have no problem with platforming in general. I suspect I need to say this because it's easy to blame the player but honestly I've tried many times. Celeste 100% wasn't a problem for me. Katana Zero's highest difficulty wasn't either a problem. And the simulation focus on Rain World is even something I enjoyed, the general platforming is good. Pouncing over cliffs and out-maneuvering enemies is fun especially with the combat. It isn't the game feel that I have a problem with which just makes it so frustrating because I like the game.

Hoping for a patch or a mod to appear because I still wanna finish it and give it more tries.

- the game looks and sounds good
- actually a good simulator
- the animation system is funny

- the lore is pretty nice and has great spiritual resonance
- nice community

Negatives:
- doesn't feel much like a designed game, extremely rough around the edges in general
- the skill curve is a messy rollercoaster
- the controls are not fun to use and take a long time to get used to
- ledges
- maneuvers that make traversal fun instead of painful are extremely obscure (it would be fine if it was fun already at the skill floor, but it's not)
- too much randomness in guidance makes it confusing instead of useful
- too much randomness in food and threats makes you artificially lose time or fail attempts to progress altogether
- while not too punishing in itself, way too much to allow for the necessary experimentation, and it's tiring to get back to the same point again
- possibility to get softlocked if you didn't figure out an optional mechanic by yourself earlier on
- requires a certain player action which makes little to no sense, as it amounts to giving up on trying to find the solution, to progress at some point

If a game doesn't make you secret blood, sweat, tears, plasma, and other vital body fluids are you even having fun?
This is the kind of game that will make you violently scream at your monitor and then punch a hole straight through it, and after your adrenaline rush is over you'll stand there like ""dang that was fun"".
You start the game looking for food, fearlessly facing off (running away from) predators, and finding cover from the rain. A few hours later you have converted to Buddhism and are now assisting a couple of supercomputers who want to do nothing more than to die.
I love all of the mechanics except for the swimming which can go die in a hole. The karma system and I should also probably just be friends. Other than that I love it.
The steps for this game are as follows:
1. Buy rainworld
2. Boot up that first file
3. Look at the cute slugcat uwu
4. Get killed by lizard
5. Its okay
6. die again
7. die (loop a couple times)

Definitely not for everyone as you do need to power through the first few hours until you gain a basic understanding of the mechanics, but once it ""clicks"" it should slowly evolve into an absolute joy to play.

The world and vast array of different regions to explore within it are all very distinct, and each of them is extremely fun to uncover and explore fully given how beautiful they look. It's totally worth it to slow down and just look around instead of speeding through every new location you find.
For me, the feelings that the graphics and style of Rain World induce in me are unlike any other game I've played in the past years. The game just has a certain type of beauty to it that I cant find in anything else.

The 2 soundtracks of Rain World combined easily add up to one of my favourite original video-game scores ever. In tandem with the aforementioned visuals, the game becomes a master of escapism. Nearly every track engorges and absorbs you in the world that you must forge your own path through, and immerses you in the animalistic nature of the various combat encounters.

As i opened with, the difficulty and non-traditional ways that the game functions may pose a challenge to anyone giving the game a try. Playing Rain World, you have to be prepared to be beat down and stomped on by the many difficulty spikes throughout a play-through. Combined with the somewhat harsh punishment for failure, it can seem extremely daunting for any new players- however, as long as you fail, there will always be some sort of lesson to be gained. Learning of a shortcut to sneak around a particularly hard obstacle, Understanding the tactics that your foes could employ to win a fight, becoming more comfortable with the movement of your player-character, everything helps. The game has no abilities, no extra lives, no way to just cheese your way out of anything. Knowledge is power; Experiment with your options.
(Side note, while seemingly simple at first, there is a surprisingly in-depth and complicated movement system to learn. Extremely rewarding if you put in a little bit of time to master it.)

As for the lore/story, there is only a handful of times that you have parts of the plot actually shown to you directly, as a lot of the lore is uncovered through collectable trinkets and such. This isn't to say the story of the game is bad however, there's an insane amount of information to find and learn about. Piecing everything together was extremely enjoyable for me, and if you like ruined, uncaring and mysterious worlds in any sort of media, i'm sure you'll enjoy it too.

For a conclusion, play this game if you want a refreshing, tough-as-nails world to explore while discovering what caused this planet to fall to ruin, all while being complemented by not only one of the best soundtracks a game has to offer, but also some of the most artistic, expressive and unique graphics you'll find in amongst a sea of low effort triple-A garbage and mediocrity.

I've played a fair few games, but this is my favourite ever.
This game is unfair, yes, we know that already. That should be made clear to you upon your first ten deaths to the same thing, because you don't get taught anything about how to move on. Such is the life of a slugcat, and you need to accept that if you want to make any progress.
You are alone.
There is nobody to help you.
There is nothing that will help you.
From start to finish, you play as a pitifully weak creature called Slugcat, and there are no upgrades, nothing to show for your progression... Except for your own skill. Like the slugcat, every cycle and every death comes with the knowledge to improve yourself. There are no powerups, no level ups, no stats. Just your sense, your understanding of the world, and your skill. 
In my opinion, there is no game out there more immersive and more intense than Rain World.

Ill start with the good stuff:

The visuals and overall atmosphere are really solid.
The few times the soundtrack gets to play always makes me stop whatever I was doing and listen.
Being dropped coldly into this ecosystem and finding your place in it is a completely unique concept that I have never seen being explored by other games. I also generally enjoyed its survival aspects.

However the game is often repetetive and frustrating.
I dont really get where the fun in the gameplay is supposed to be coming from:
The platforming is rather slow, unresponsive and clunky not to mention the claustrophobic leveldesign that at times completely removes that aspect from the game.

""Maybe its about exploration"" I thought. But the games systems dont reward or encourage exloration either: If you explore you die. Either becuase of unfamiliar terrain, enemies or because of the rains. Speeking of... do you remember the rain in BotW? How it would hinder you from climbing that mountain? Now imagine that but ten times worse. Why would there be a time limit for exploration? The rains either lead to you retreating back to your previous hibernation spot or to a miserable death somewhere on the way to the next one. I basically always chose the latter which ment I would explore the rain world bit by bit each time getting a little further. This wouldnt be to bad if it wasnt for the karma system, you see each time you die your karma level drops. And like I said you die a lot. But when your karma level is too low you cant get past the gates to the next area anymore which basically makes all your progress pointless and leads to you grinding your karma level back up again.

Ive played up to the Shaded Citadel the games third area and its giving me Tomb of the Giant vibes. To give an example as to why I think its poorly designed; the area is completely dark. The only way to see anything is by grabbing some glowing animal. However because of its weight, carrying it reduces your jump hight, causing some jumps to be unreasonably frustrating or straight up impossible. I saw that the monk class can see in the dark but I dont want to start from the beginning all over again. 
I dont know wether Im gonna push through and finish the game or if im gonna move on to something else. I can definetly imagine me competely changing my mind about this game if I get to see the end and ending up loving it but as of now this is my recomendation:

Is rain world a bad game? No. Is it a masterpiece? Hell no. Is it worth your time and money? Possibly, if youre really curious for it. Just dont set your hopes too high.",1698270654,1698270654,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   Also like TF2 multiplayer, every other creature in Rain World starts out being absurdly more powerful, capable, & harder to kill than you. Unless you can stack the odds in your favor, or learn to move like a ninja slug, you're going to die a lot before you ""git gud.""

   Personally, I recommend looking up the lore & some tutorials to help you understand what the hell is going on, & learn the basics of movement. As you master basics, learn the more advanced techniques. Personally, I've enjoyed the challenge of learning the movement, as I did in TF2 (RIP).

   Really fun, once you embrace the randomness, difficulty, & exploration. In this game more than many, ""Journey before Destination"" applies tremendously.

   If you don't like exploring, overcoming adversity, & developing your in-game movement (IRL Keyboard commando) skills, then this game might not be for you.

The controls (again, for me) feel smooth once you get the hang of them, and jumping around from pole to pole to move faster feels very rewarding. 

[ GOOD THINGS ]

- The predators and prey feel very expertly coded. I cant predict what they are gonna do next, and in most cases, I have to wildly flee myself before I get mauled.

- This game is not easy. I will mention this in the bad section aswell, but not giving the player the power of god, or a double jump, feels smart. If an overseer recommends I go somewhere that i cant reach, i will keep trying to get there, in various ways, if needed, because i know it is possible for me to get there. 

- The soundtrack, character design, and rain system feel flawless aswell. The game gives me a capacity to roam and be awake, but if you stay out too long, then you need to get moving to a shelter and NOW.

[ BAD THINGS ]

- This game is hard. You will not be fed the next area on a silver spoon, and grabbing fruit or grabbing batflies can be challenging. The rain can catch you. The lizards can. Any number of predatory animals or plants can reset you a cycle. But it isnt listlissly impossible hard, as most guides make it seem. Go at your own pace, run away from lizards instead of fighting them, if you want. This worlds only limit is time and skill.

Overall, I love this game, but you dont have to play if you dont want to. Just go at your own pace :]",1698193119,1698193119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI is also amazing, I often just messed around with some of the enemies to watch how they would react, very interesting and I'm considering getting the DLC for safari mode, so I can play around with the ai without risking my life.

In general, I highly recommend this game if you like platforming, as there is plenty of things the movement allows you to do and it makes combat feel very rewarding when you survive. The survival aspects mix well and I would not be surprised if this becomes one of my new favorite games.

Sometimes my cat can survive in water for super long, other times my guy is in water for 3 seconds and dies. No air meter, I don't know how long till I drown. Exploration is failure. The game often give you 2 branching paths as if it wants you to explore, problem is that one path can lead you to a shelter and the other way will,  waste your time and then it rains, you die in the rain, rinse repeat. More than a few times I enter a room but one of the enemies that can kill you in one hit will just site at a door/pipe, glitching out, rolling over it self or stuck in a pipe I need to go through, wasting time until it rains. Nothing is communicated through you. It's 100% trial and error. I was in the draining area and died to a school of fish. At no point in the game until then did it even hint that fish can kill me. It was only after I randomly wandered into a different area that I seen the fish glow red, which usually means they are dangerous. Problem is that not all enemies glow, some blend in with the background. Some only glow at certain times. The fish only glow near the surface, so when I encountered them for the first time in a mostly underwater area, I die. The game forces you to walk on egg shells and take your time observing and exploring to then kill you with rain. The game punishes you for activity exploring quickly by having enemies blend into to the background or spawn directly in front of the pipes you need to go in to progress and you just have to wait until they move. The game teaches that you can throw things at enemies but it serves nearly no purpose...... until it does. Trial and error isn't difficulty, trial and error isn't a game-play mechanic, it's lazy. Im not going to ram my head into a wall 50 times until I guess the correct answer. The games just give throws occasional new hazards and enemy at you and you either guess how to deal with it correctly the first time or die trying to figure out, or better yet, just trying random things out or go a different direction until it rains and kills you anyway. The whole hibernation thing only serves to extend the game, making it seem like a longer experience. Hibernation doesn't even do anything but gates some areas. Early in the game I ran between 3 or 4 rooms, eating, hibernating assume it would do something positive but it's just there to gate off some areas. Removal of the hibernation thing in favor of a regular checkpoint system (instead of shelter) would improve the game in my opinion.",1698005542,1698017253,False,2,0,0.469670236110687256,0,True,False,False

At first glance, Rain World seemed to me like just another cute little indie platformer. When I downloaded it, I did so along with Ori and Planet of Lana in an effort to stock up on 2D games I could play on a laptop. I was in for a rude awakening when I realized that this was a survival game in a harsh and brutal environment with complex and nuanced enemy design and an overwhelmingly large, scary, yet beautiful world.

The following is a detailed review of everything I thought the game did well and did poorly from the perspective of a completionist with all achievements and over 240 hours of gameplay. Since I absolutely adore this game, let’s get the negative points out of the way first.

[h3]What the game does wrong[/h3]

[b]The control scheme is god awful[/b]
The entire game is controlled with 2 buttons. Every action in the game is basically the jump button or the pick-up button or one of those combined with a directional input or with each other. This can lead to extremely frustrating situations where you’ll be fumbling around trying to pick up or drop or eat certain items but won’t be able to because all 3 of those actions are the same button. This is probably done to simplify the controls since the game is already very harsh in other regards and can be easily remedied with fan-made steam workshop mods.

[b]The randomness of the world can be frustrating at times[/b]
Rain World is a massive complex ecosystem where enemy encounters and behavior can depend on a multitude of factors. Spawns are fixed but how the game’s creatures decide what to do and where to go is very dynamic in nature. Although this is one of the most beautiful aspects of the game, it can also be the most frustrating. It’s fairly common to encounter situations where the events of a cycle will play out in the most unfortunate possible way. Predators can block exits and just sit there or block an access pipe, aerial threats will attack at the worst time imaginable, or a friendly creature that is absolutely necessary to progress will just refuse to cooperate, etc. This is, in my opinion, a small price to pay in exchange for the sheer excitement of the game’s dynamism but can still be infuriating sometimes.

[h3]What the game does right[/h3]

[b]Gorgeous visuals with a unique art style[/b]
This will ultimately come down to whether or not you’re a fan of pixel art, but if you are, then this game is nothing short of beautiful. Every area is visually appealing in its’ own way, with its’ own color pallete and theme. From industrial gutters, to abandoned underground train tracks, to a night-time metropolis, to a bridged complex overlooking a rainbow filled skyline. All dark and unsettling yet uniquely gorgeous.

[b]A massive and intricate world[/b]
Rain World’s map is overwhelmingly large. It is comprised of over a dozen regions, each with their own aesthetic and their own fauna and flora. Each region has tons of things to explore, enemies to encounter, and different paths to take. As you pour more and more hours into the game, you’ll get a feel for how all the areas connect to each other and how best to path your way through the world on the way to different goals or objectives. There are always multiple ways from A to B at any given moment and what path you take, or what regions you choose to trek through or avoid is entirely up to you.

[b]A dark and gritty atmosphere[/b]
The game has a unique way of inspiring a sense of dread which is represented in all manner of forms. You’re travelling through a long abandoned/forgotten industrial area, in a race against the rainfall with the constant threat of predators around every corner. The world you’re in is harsh and unforgiving and simply surviving while finding enough food to hibernate at the next shelter is a real challenge. It’s a unique thrill with the stress of avoiding hazards and evading predators juxtaposed with the sheer euphoria of finding food or a shelter in an unexplored area. Combine this weird dichotomy of emotions with a dark and dreadful world and then throw in a beautifully melancholic soundtrack and you get a unique atmosphere unlike any game I’ve played.

[b]A profoundly beautiful story under the surface[/b]
I won’t get into any story spoilers here but the game’s story is very deep and meaningful. The story isn’t presented to you up-front, but is always lying in the background waiting to be pieced together by dilligent players. The story also takes place over a timeline with each of the main and DLC characters contributing a small part to the greater picture.

[b]A living breathing ecosystem[/b]
The creatures in Rain World are vastly different from one another in their appearance and behavior. This can range from friendly to fearful to neutral to hyper-aggressive. Each creature has an optimal way to be dealt with, along with it’s place in the food chain and will behave according to a complex set of built-in relationships between them. A predator that wants to eat you may be scared off or killed by an even larger threat. A fight between two predators can provide an opportunity to slip past, which can sometimes even save you after being caught in the jaws of a predator. Some creatures have a reputation system with the player and will react to the player differently according to what their current standing with the player is. Certain predators can be fed to tame them, at which point they will follow you around and defend you (as long as you continue to feed them). Creatures will hunt, kill, and flee from each other and all these interactions are unfolding in the world constantly, even without the player’s presence. This furthers the sensation that this dauntingly massive and unforgiving world exists with or without you and you are only a small part of it.

[b]The best DLC I have ever seen offered for a game[/b]
Downpour more than doubles the amount of content the game offers for a fraction of the price. Downpour adds a whopping 5 playable characters that each have their own campaigns, unique mechanics, and new stories that take place at different points in the timeline which serve to fill in the gaps and paint a more complete picture of the events that take place. Each campaign also includes character exclusive regions and slightly altered areas based on the campaign’s placement in the timeline. One of the campaigns even features[spoiler]a complete ice age reskin of the entire world map + the collapse of one zone onto another.[/spoiler] Each of these characters and their campaigns could easily be their own DLC and I would happily buy them, but Downpour adds FIVE of them which is a gargantuan amount of extra content to an already content-rich game.

[u]TL;DR[/u]
I started Rain World expecting to play a cute little platformer and what I got instead was a brutally harsh yet thoroughly enjoyable survival game. It was a journey through a beautifully crafted world with a complex ecosystem and a profoundly deep story under the game’s surface. It offers an overwhelming amount of content to enjoy and only gets more gratifying the more hours you put into it.",1697976598,1697989298,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Fantastic ecosystem; game does a great job at making you feel helpless
Cons:
- Screen cutoffs in big, open areas that can often get you killed
- Really useful and life-saving movement tech left completely hidden from the player (without DLC)
- Can easily make new players feel stuck/lost (God forbid you go to Farm Arrays and not Drainage/Industrial in your first playthrough)
- Jungle Leeches (I will find the sick individual/s who designed these things)

This game will unapologetically beat the living hell out of every new player and piss on their unconscious bodies as they're down. But if you're persistent (and quite honestly insane enough) to keep trying and learn, you'll experience one of the most breathtaking and unique 2D exploration gaming experiences to date.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
I'll start off with what I would classify this game as, because it's a pretty unique experience. In short, it's an environmental survival and resource-management platformer sprinkled with a bit of rogue-lite in there. To be honestly with you, the closest game that I've played that I could compare it to is Noita for it's brutality and platforming, but that's about where the similarities end.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but it has an acquired taste. There will be b*llshit deaths that you can't control. There will be no-win situations. The phrase ""What the F*CK IS THAT??!?"" will be said countless times during your time in the brutal setting of Rain World. However, what this game excels at is creating a beautiful ecosystem to observe and realize that you are only a very small part of. Let's get into that more, shall we?

[h2]The Strengths[/h2]
The environment of this game is extremely well done, down to the smallest detail, and much of this is due to how enemies work. Not only are the level layout and aesthetics gorgeous and gritty, but the enemies feel at home there. Different factions of creatures are in specific places of the map, but can venture out, fighting other factions or even amongst themselves. Furthermore, the ""day"" cycle of the game (going to keep this spoiler free) determines what enemies are out, and let me tell you, when the day is ending, even your WORST enemies simply want to survive like you do. All of these tiny interactions of the AI are what make experiencing this game truly special, because no run through the same area will be same. Getting ambushed by a massive enemy swooping out of nowhere at the beginning of an area? Well, even though your expecting it on the next run it never comes. The enemies are not simply roadblocks for the player, they are a part of the world, just like the player.

Also, this game can be horribly terrifying, especially when you stumble across new enemies (which happens often). I cannot tell you how many times I have entered a new room, seen what sort of abomination lies with in only to turn tail and run immediately. If this game has one thing to saw, it is that you are not the main character, you are only a small yet integral part of the world you find yourself in...

Overall, this game is great, but only if you're OK with a few b*llshit moments here and there. Otherwise, learning the game and how it works is a joy, and I'm still finding interactions that I've never seen previously. Would recommend, and good luck, fellow slugcat!",1697676682,1697742445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you play this, I strongly suggest that you try to play it as blind as possible because discovering this gorgeous and enormous world is the best part about this game.
However the map is kind of non-linear to a fault because at some point, after discovering most of the game, I got stuck because I took the wrong entrance to one of the last area. So you know, do everything you can, don't hesitate to backtrack because I guarantee there are passages you missed the first time around but do spoil yourself eventually if you feel like you need to to go forward. I also wish the guide helped a little bit more. Like it will help you fuck around a LONG time before it reminds you that you're not at all going ""forward"" to an objective.

This is all I'm gonna say. The journey ahead will be hard but it will be so rewarding.

This is one of the best games I have ever played.
With a story and lore so intrinsically built into the world that the experience integrates the player into the world's ecosystem through sheer immersion.

Oh, and I guess it's pretty challenging as well.

I played the game for the longest while the same way I imagined a Slugcat would try and survive. I moved when food got low and avoided confrontation to the best of my ability since there was nearly no benefit to willingly engage something bigger than me in combat.

Yet despite all the difficulty at the beginning I could hunt titans by the end of my journey.

dying to a dropwig when the shelter is right in front of you.
falling off a cliff and having to restart the expedition just before you complete it.
endlessly dying in the same area over and over again.
finally gaining enough karma to go through a gate before losing it to dying to something stupid multiple times in a row.
and many more.

all of these things make me want to commit war crimes on puppies and gouge my eyes out with rage.... but in a good way you know. another way to think of it is like masturbating with a bad lube your đїC̄Ƙ is developing friction injuries but it still feels good so you keep on going.

To try and describe the feelings I have about this game is an essay within itself. Rain World is one of the most impactful, beautiful, frustrating, and down-right cruel games I have ever played in my life. 

This game has fundamentally changed the way I view the world, and not in a generic “Ahaha! I learned about Buddhism!” kind of way. It defies all nature, there is no world where Rain World is not frustrating, there will always be pain attached to this game. 

However despite that you always come back to Rain World, because it is unlike any other game. No Game displays such skill in enemy AI, movement, combat, art and more. It gives me this feeling of Super Smash Bros Melee, a game that beyond all reason should not be successful. A game that almost feels broken, unfinished, or fundamentally flawed, yet a game that surpasses and will continue to surpass all others like it. 

For most, flaws are not what they look for, they want perfection, but for people like you and I, Rain World’s flaws are what makes Rain World… Rain World. 

I love this game.

its beautiful, its just, beautiful, and I find it really goddamn fun
from the world to the characters and creatures in it, this game is fantastic, and I wish i could experience my first playthrough again for the first time, its good.

the MUSIC is SO GOOD, its beautiful and in some cases just really grOoVy 
and the slugcats.. I LOVE SLUGCATSSSSSSS

but seriously, this game is amazing, i dont care how HARD it is, or how much it makes me mad sometimes, or how unfair it can be, this game will always be a masterpiece to me, and i fucking love it, yes it has its problems, but nothing crazy, maybe just some slight annoyances

Very unique, challenging, punishing, rewarding, so much fun. Buy the DLC if you enjoyed playing the base game, it has more content than the base game and is really enjoyable and well made. Definitely worth the price unlike many AAA games.

The AI is top tier and really lively, the pixel art and environments are amazing. This game has a lot to say if you're into lore and philosophy, but if you're not you can just play it for fun and enjoy the ride. 

This game does not hold your hand at all and lets you make all the decisions. 

Some advice for beginners: This game is really hard at times, so if you're really struggling don't feel ashamed to play the ""easy"" mode and choose monk. In this game the easy mode is still pretty hard if you're new to the game and is really more comparable to the ""normal"" mode in any other game. I played monk for my first ever run and still found it difficult. If you find yourself getting lost and not knowing what to do, don't be afraid to look at the wiki or a guide.

There are so many points of frustration that need some quality of life attention, especially rerolling the mob spawns and grinding food for gates. I also think the second area (Drainage System) leaves an especially bad impression compared to the amount of freedom in the first area. Hitting credits ended up being more force than fun. If you are a fan of punishing platformers like Super Meat Boy or even Jump King and want a less breakneck pace, give this one a try. If you come in expecting an open-world exploration game where you survive by hunting your own food... you are like me, misled by some VERY loose definitions of those words.

but seriously. this game is freaking life changing. like basically if you like platformer games, story games, and games that make you want to rip your hair out at all, buy it. buy the main game and if you like it, the DLC makes it even better. it's like a whole new better game added onto the already unbeatable base game. the story is so intricate but at the same time simple to understand at least the basics. it's the kind that will make you think about it for years and in the most random situations. the characters lore, if you dig a bit deeper than surface level, is so incredibly detailed and the personalities, especially of some later game creatures, are so well put together it's honestly amazing. it immerses you almost instantly in a world where you aren't all powerful. you arent a god. it feels like life kinda. you are just a creature in an ecosystem. you can eat the other things, but they can eat you too. its a learning experience to survive. you will die. you will die so many times. dont give up i promise its worth it. (also no. dont go running with your one spear towards that lizard. if it doesnt care about you, just go around it. flight is better than fight in most situations with this game.) all the people who said it's too hard - honestly - just didnt try hard enough. im sorry but it's probably true. its very much a try, try again, and again and again and again. and again. and maybe one more time. like i have over 200 hours on this game at the time of writing this and i still havent been able to finish all the campaigns without cheats. its a horribly hard game but everything else it has from the story to the animation to the art makes up for it. and on the topic of animation, the animation feels REAL. like its an actual animal. even though its pixelated and 2D it still is one of the most immersive games that money can buy. and the art in game and in the community is amazing. like truly some of the best art you'll ever see. especially from the rain world community which is one of the most accepting, inclusive, talented, and loving communities you will ever see on the internet. i need to go to bed now so i need to wrap this up but. buy rain world. thank you for listening to my ted talk. i will expand it tomorrow.

Probably my favorite game of all time.
It has amazing environments, sound design, and beautiful art and music. 
The main campaigns have tear-jerking stories, and I love how the player is meant to infer and piece together the lore from the environment and what little information you are given. I also adore how the game doesn't hold your hand and emphasizes exploration and figuring things out yourself, i rarely had to pull up a wiki to figure stuff out, if at all.
Some things I personally would like to see improvement on:
Certain areas of the map being improved to remove invisible walls, I think it breaks the immersion. Maybe replacing them with some physical barrier that fits in with the environment.
Small fixes to creature spawns and AI softlocking you (notable example is the caramel lizard in farm arrays by the gate to outskirts, which could also be fixed by just making the shelter a little bit bigger.)
I also really appreciate the dev team's efforts to fix modding on Linux.
i really don't have much to complain about, most of the game is really well made and the current bugs and goofs are so minor.
I do realize the gameplay isn't for everyone, but if you love exploration and discovering things for yourself you will love this game, it also provides a great challenge.",1697038643,1697038643,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Through all the characters and epochs we witness the world decaying, as nothing actually mattered and is ready to meet the Void. At the same time we are reminded that the cycle is unending and will start anew.

This game is my favorite among indie titles and not without a reason. Many talk about its unprecedented natural habitat simulation and dynamic animations, fluidness of movement, steep learning curve, art style, story and lore. For me its all of these things combined into something almost flawless as an experience. It might be not the best gaming you will ever get, even though its really solid and fun soon as you dive head first and submerge yourself properly. But it is The Experience.

It only got better with Downpour. I cannot sing enough praises to the developers that worked of DLC that worked so much time on it by their lonesome. Videocult is also to be commended as they worked towards bringing DLC developers on board. Downpour introduced so much into story and contextualized many elements from the original game, at the same time largely expanding The Experience. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that the game might not be everyone's cup of tea, This review is purely subjective and comes from heart.

While you start the game not knowing much else other than the fact that you are a little creature and must find a way to survive, once you get further into the game you realize just how rich the world is! Everything feels alive in this game and no two runs are the same. Hell, even each cycle is completely different, even if you're in the same area! 

The replayability for this game is insane! Even more so if you have the DLC which I 100% do recommend if you enjoy the base game. While the game is already one that you can replay over and over, if you do find things getting a bit stale then look at the workshop! The modding community for this game is astounding and it seems that every day there is new mods to add and try out! From cosmetics to game aids to new fan made areas, enemies, or even completely new slug cats to play as with their own mechanics! You can also play with friends through remote play so only one of you need to own the game. 

I will warn you that the game can get incredibly frustrating at times- especially when you're newer to the game as there is a complete lack of hand holding. You will die *a lot*, but its just part of the game. If that doesn't stop you from turning away completely I really do suggest you try it out! 

This game is so incredibly beautiful. The music, art, story- everything is amazing! As far as I've seen there really is no game like this one. If you want a game that will challenge you or you love a game that has amazing lore or of course if you like just being a little creature then this is the game for you!!",1696775832,1696775832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw it years ago and didn't think much, but then I actually tried the game for myself and delved into the lore and MAN it is all I've been able to think about.
This has genuinely become one of my favourite games ever.

The gameplay is incredibly fun- unforgiving at times, yes, but I personally enjoy the challenge and unfairness. I especially liked messing around in expeditions once I figured them out! That and the movement tech!! It's so much fun to learn! :]
The music is GODLY. Very fun to have on in the background. If I could have some sort of physical copy of it I would.
The characters are so captivating and the story is SO GOD DAMN HEARTWRENCHING but OHH it is worth it. I love seeing everyone's theories-- I love how creative everything is.

This review doesn't have the greatest formatting but I thought to finally share my love for this game. I've bought it twice for myself and five times for friends- and I doubt I'll stop anytime soon!

I do not know what I am supposed to be doing or where I am supposed to be going. I shouldn't have to look up guides online to figure out where to go or what to do. Even after looking up a guide for how to fight these lizards, I still struggle. Either there are no visible weapons nearby, or I am in a tight corridor that does not allow movement. Not to mention, I don't even know how to throw in any direction other than left or right. Is that just me or is that an actual in game mechanic that forbids being able to throw in all directions? Again, I shouldn't be forced to look up a guide for every single thing in this game. I'm sure it's a good game if you can become good at it.

Mechanically, it's pretty amazing, I know for a fact I only know a tiny, tiny bit of the abilities of the slugcats, and intend on doing more runs to discover the secrets Rain World has to offer, both in terms of story, and mechanics.

An incredible experience I recommend, especially if you have a friend to do the adventure with. This game is hard. Very hard, and it's very punishing, however, the reward of survival through the challenges of the environments and fauna trying to devour you is great- though don't expect the game to actually reward you. It tricks you into feeling rewarded, which is arguably even better. 

This visually stunning, pixel-art style game makes you feel like you're part of its environment, not in control of it, and that's very rare.""

---- Edit:
I've played quite a bit more since I reviewed this game, and got to experience most scugs and the storyline tied to them. The story is amazing, and got me emotional multiple times. [spoiler]Rivulet and Saint[/spoiler] are my favourites.

I beat the Survivor Campaing, it took me around 27 hours, pretty fun experience overall and definitely worth experiencing. It is, along Zelda Botw, one of the best games about exploration out there.
[h2] Pros [/h2]
[b]Pretty fair unfair game for the most part[/b], the game doesnt expect you to have a high karma level after some difficulty mid game sections, which is nice, it also raise your karma level in a part where you need to be at maximum karma. It's a game where you will eventually beat it if you keep trying.
[b]Exploring is fun[/b], it's just plain fun, that's the main reason to play the game, the game never get repetitive because each region introduce enough things to keep the game fun.
[b]Gorgeous visuals.[/b] Everything from the locations to the enemies to the slugcats is so charming and memorable.
[b]Pretty memorable soundtrack.[/b] Thou, it's kinda hard to search for specific themes.
[h2] Cons [/h2]
[b]Extremely unreliable Overseer[/b], it was gone for most part of my mid/late game playthrough, I did Unfortunate Development twice because I missed the path to [Redacted]
[b]It doesn't bother to introduce more advanced techniques that make the game more fun.[/b] Just read the wiki of the game.
[b]Pretty simple story.[/b] It'll be hours and hours of basically no story at all, you can get extra lore using pearls, but that requieres a lot of effort and backtracking.
[b]I personally didn't like the last section of the game.[/b] It was hard to see where I could move and I was swimming in the void for 25 minutes. It was not hard or something, just disappointing.

well i bought the DLC with the game when i first got it knowing it was likely something i would like after i played a little bit of the game on a friend's console and i am glad i did
when i played this game for the first time it was like i when i played Mario for the first time when i was younger
in other worlds its nice to have a game that kicked my ass for a while before i learned how to play it and the ins and outs of its game mechanics and was still fun
to say its unlike anything else i have played is a bit of an understatement so here are my thoughts on it in detail

(Lore/Story) the story is pretty good i like the world building and the vibes this game gives me when playing though its areas 

(Controls) the movement is clunky but not in a bad way you kinda have to drag yourself though the world like the rodent you play as and there is a lot of neat tech and funky stuff you can do because of this it just takes a bit of getting used to it tho i have always used a controller when playing this game so idk what playing keyboard is like

(Gameplay) getting used to the movement and avoiding being eaten is very important if you cant do that you wont get anywhere in this game. other than that you eat food, wander, avoid the rain, find shelter and die a lot to name few of the things you will be doing while playing and the creature AI is really something else helps make this game feel alive and hungry for Slugcat meat 

(Graphics) i know quite a few people that don't understand the appeal of pixelated graphics if you are like these people and cant understand why this game is stunning and gives of the vibes it does then i feel bad for you 

(Music) the soundtrack is fantastic and really adds to the vibes love the threat music that plays when enemies are near you

(Issues) the only real issue i have with the game that i can think of off the top of my head is the way screen doesn't scroll in larger rooms rather once you get to the end of the screen and can move past it will transition to the next screen even with the threat music that can help you know where danger is the lack of screen scroll can still lead to a lot of deaths to off screen enemies that fall in to the screen from above or are waiting for you when the screen transitions while you move across the room

(recommending) even tho i had a great time with this game and still do i really don't know how to recommend the game to people because of how different it is maybe give it a try if it looks fun

(Community) while i haven't talked much with other players as of now the modded content that is being made is fantastic keep up the good work guys",1696236663,1696236663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Understand that this game is hard, and that it is MEANT to be hard. You will die. A lot. There is no avoiding it (unless you use cheats for godmode, in which case what's the point?)

This game's skill ceiling is off of the charts. Different levels of play look drastically different. The movement system is one of the most dynamic in any game ever, and it's ecosystem is well done. You aren't anyone special in this game. You aren't some chosen figure destined for greatness. You are most often just a member of the ecosystem, or OCCASIONALLY a messenger.

If you are a rage gamer, don't play the game. You will dislike it. This game requires MULTIPLE tries to understand how good it is, and if you aren't willing to put in that time or effort, don't play it, it's not for you. The only way you get ""stronger"" is EXCLUSIVELY by getting better at the game. Literal experience is your XP bar.

Not a metroidvania btw. It has a lot of elements of one, like the different region names and... well that's about it. This is not a metroidvania, as much as Mr Scug looks like Mr Hollow Knight.

[b] Animations [/b]
Rain World has a unique 2D animation system. The game doesn't use sprites or pre-rendered animations - the animations are run in real-time by code and react dynamically to the environment and world around you.

[b] Survival [/b]
You play as a slugcat, a small creature low on the food chain, and are thrown into this dangerous world to survive. You must learn to use the environment to survive; by finding food and shelter, using the local fauna to help traverse the world, or learning how to out-manoeuvre the local predators.

[b] Movement [/b]
There is a lot of advanced movement tech in this game. Heck, there's an 87 page long google doc detailing how to perform most of this tech. Strangely, you don't need to learn any of it. It's all just there to enhance replay value and speedrunning.

[b] Adventure [/b]
The game is best experienced blind, there are a lot of wonderful things to find in Rain World; but if you are struggling to progress or understand what to do it may be worth looking up advice.

[b] Co-op [/b]
With the Downpour DLC, you have access to local co-op (which can be accessed through remote play), and 5 new DLC campaigns all of which have unique characters and changes across the world. Some criticise the DLC for being more game-like and less immersive, but I never ran into this as a problem.

[b] Achievements [/b]
Getting 100% achievements was ... in some parts a frustrating experience. Some of the challenges in the arena were a bit annoying (although some of them were great!). Challenge 70, while cool, was very annoying forcing you to replay the slow and boring phases 1-3 to access the much more difficult phases 4-6.

after thinking about it for months, i think this qualifies as the second best game ive ever played (first being terraria). its worth the money just to try because if u manage to finish it (especially now with the DLC), its life changing

One will traverse a world of abject horrors, avoiding danger and crafting weapons (gun) that aid them in the most significant ways they can. 

Hunter Mode will kick your ass.

The story exists, though it may be hard to believe considering that one will likely not see nor understand the unfolding events. This can be helped through the fortunate created mods and cheats that can give for a significantly more forgiving environment, though one should try their skill in the milquetoast flavor to start. (Perhaps you are ""built different."") The DLC aptly dubbed ""Downpour"" adds a multitude of new business ventures for your more communist government to explore and experience. 5 of them, to be exact. 

As for those campaigns, the premise of each is simple. Respectable chef. Vaporeon. I Have No Mouth, But I Must Scream, An ecological and literal terrorist, and Spiritualistic Apocalypto Fuzzy turned Dr Manhattan.

Woe be unto thee who forgo the loss of funds this masterpiece will jerk from your damp, sweaty grasp. They do it from love. Though the loss of funds is quite significant, it is often lessened during select ""sales"" that allow the commonfolk to indulge in it's beauty, and thus so I cannot help but recommend her majesty ""Rain World"" to any who find her 'personality' the slightest bit interesting.

This game, a masterpiece.

""Do you see the same as me?
Beauty continuing to bloom even in a place long forgotten.

I did not have the will to depart, nor the desire.

Why did they always search for an escape, as if we were imprisoned?

What offering from the void could usurp the gift of life already given?

This moment, right here! It is where we are meant to be.""

Tips:
- Play blind. Don't look up anything! The game will surprise you endlessly.
- Enable the built-in REMIX mod with the absolutely necessary QOL changes.
- Use the map. The area's you've explored will stay visible after you die. There are dead ends. 
- Experiment with everything you find. Don't be scared to die, because dying isn't that bad (especially close to your last shelter).
- Pay attention to the tips in the loading screens. e.g. The physics based movement system is actually really awesome once you finally get used to it.
- Don't forget to finish the game all the way to the credits eventually",1675126689,1695586734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, here's my updated review.
I absolutely love and adore this game; however, I don't want people to be misinformed about what this game offers.

PROS:
--- Story ---
The story that takes place during the events of this game is very interesting, and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a new and abstract world. The story is separated into different campaigns, each taking place during a different time. The combined story can be woven together through the details experienced in each campaign.
Simply put, I would recommend this game for its interesting story alone. It also does an amazing job at environmental storytelling.
--- Characters ---
Without spoiling too much, every major character in this game is amazing, they all have their nuances and find their own niche within the community that adores this game. I cannot dive too much farther without spoiling the story.
MIXED:
--- Movement System ---
Surprisingly, the movement system is very fluid yet very punishing. Initially, the movement system was very frustrating to me, and I believe most people quit their first time as a result of their problems with the movement system (too finicky or responsive). The movement system can throw people off and often leads to many deaths when first starting out. However, with how the movement system works, it can be manipulated with a very high skill ceiling to make for some extremely fun gameplay.
CONS:
--- Combat ---
The combat could be considered 1-Dimensional, as it mostly consists of stabbing monsters with spears. However, the movement system can be used to make combat more interesting. In most scenarios though, combat remains consistently the same.
--- Some Gameplay Elements ---
Some campaigns (in Downpour) involve a quest-like delivery system, where the main goal of the campaign is to just deliver an item and then go to ""x"" location. This is mitigated by the amazing environments that you pass through; however, if you aren't interested in the ""environments/world,"" you might become bored by this gameplay loop.
Additionally, some things in this game are just too punishing and rage-inducing, such as a later-game area. This area is amazing to look at, yet has very odd game-design which can make you want to pull your own hair out. There's a few instances of odd game-design in other campaigns as well.
CONCLUSION:
For people looking for an interesting story and those who find themselves to be more artistic, I would definitely recommend this game. However, with some elements of the game, it can prove to be very frustrating and seemingly unfair. The game doesn't hold back, and veterans of this game will find that it is much fairer than it seems. It has a steep learning curve, but I find that pushing through and learning the game as Survivor or Monk (the first campaigns) will make the game much more enjoyable.",1660528039,1695425620,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The lore is rich, and, albeit confusing, extremely fun to toy with and think about. However, despite all these pros, I would like to preface this;

[b] Rain World IS NOT for everybody. [/b]

This game is as wonderful as it is difficult. I personally wouldn't have it any other way, however it still has its downsides and flaws associated with this extreme difficulty.

Rain World is:
☑ An extremely engaging platformer, that, when you master certain controls, is quite fun.
☑ A lore packed world, that can either leave you extremely confused, or allow for rather rich storytelling.
☑ An extremely difficult and RNG dependent game. One spout of bad luck and completely halt progress, and generally feel unfair. This is (supposedly) by design, which allows for a difficult challenge.
☑ A game that has decided to make me petrified of sounds scissors make, and rain.

Rain World is not:
☒ A metroidvania. You gain no significant boosts throughout the game, however it does reward exploration and curiousity. I feel the only exception to this would be two of the slugcats in Downpour.
☒ Perfectly designed. This game is covered with flaws, head to toe. While I love it dearly, I'd like to acknowledge some here.

Some Flaws with Rain World.
- The static screen-based camera can lead to some extremely unfair or downright impossible to avoid deaths. Yes, there is a mod to fix this issue, but I would like to bring it up here.
- Janky Controls, especially for a newer player. While they are purposely weird to simulate what it is like to be an animal lost in an unfamiliar world, they aren't exactly friendly to new players in some instances.
- Confusing and rather hard to navigate regions. While I love getting lost in some of Rain world's regions, this game has a severe lack of showing the player how to progress or where to go. For those who'd like a completely unguided playthrough, it can be rather difficult to even escape Outskirts.
- Some of the RNG related instances. Mostly in the form of where creatures will decide to perch whole cycle. This can be extremely frustrating and downright unfair in some instances.

Despite my negatively, I do hold this game extremely dearly, and would recommend it to anybody who'd like to give it a shot. However, just know this game may not be for everybody, and may not be for you. I do hope that if you do give this game a shot, try to enjoy it to the best of your abilities, for some of the experiences in this game will be some of the best.",1679318267,1695263267,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

   Deaths seem unfair and unexpected because of all the randomness in how creatures spawn and behave, but that also means that the same section of map can play completely differently each time. The controls seem extremely slow and clunky at first, but as you learn the different moves you can perform, it becomes fluid and cohesive. There is a lot of difficulty in the game that many people might not enjoy, but if you can get past all that, the game is really fun.
   Now, I'm gonna be honest and say I did use the Rain World wiki. quite a bit. 
   For the first 5 hours or so I did play without any help, but I got stuck and had no idea what to do. While I do recommend figuring stuff out first, don't be afraid to use the wiki. There's no use ruining your enjoyment of the game just to have a ""pure"" run of the game.
   Overall, it's really fun even though sometimes it makes you want to chuck your controller at the screen and never play it again.",1695262711,1695262711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]This game is not for everyone.[/b] The graphics are an absolutely stunning tribute to pixel art, but game play is quite frankly tedious. This game is a die, die and die again style game that I could see being frustrating for some people, but others who are used to those types of games (Hollow knight, Celeste, Dead cells, etc.) would see this game as awesome.

[b]My advice is to do what I'm doing now, and try playing it for an hour or so so you can see what the game is like, and get a refund if its not for you.[/b]

In the end, this game just wasn’t for me.
I’m still going to leave this as recommended, as I know some people will love this game, but for me, the learning curve in the controls were just too different from other platformers that I’ve played. In the end, I found that it was just frustrating to play, since I have several hundred of hours in games like Celeste and hollow knight.

This is a 8.5/10, and my third favorite game of all time, BUT: [h1]I'm going to actually tell you if you'll like this game or not, BECAUSE IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE[/h1] (no seriously), these are VERY important, and though the trailers and description make it somewhat clear I want to expand on it:

To enjoy this game you must be fine with these things:

- Dying A LOT, this is the major one. This game will kill you after 20 minutes of progression out of nowhere right next to a checkpoint and send you all the way back before you did it. This game is a type of difficulty you don't see a lot. I always play games on the hardest difficulties, and (at least in my opinion) very good at games, especially ones like Rain World at first glance. Rain World throws all the classic difficulty systems out the window though. Rain World's difficulty comes from addapting to new enviroments, learning enemy patterns, randomness, it's unforgiving nature, and survival (I.E. Finding food and not failing a janky parkour section).

- RNG, lots of RNG, ties in with last point.

- Getting lost and a ton of exploration, which is just as much of a con as much as it's a pro, it's just a preference. If you don't particularly like getting lost and exploring and all that jazz, go into the game for a bit, get past the first few areas, and if you dont like that aspect, use the Wiki maps, and you'll have a great time still.

(Added) - Purposefully jank mechanics. Rain World has one of the most jank and weird movement systems on purpose, and that can justifiably be frustrating to people. Even the combat is weird. You're mostly one shot to almost everything, and the combat involves finding spears, finding rocks, and throwing things at your enemies' weakpoints until they die. You don't get your spears back, you have to either find a new one or pull it back out of enemies, this is a type of combat I hadn't really seen before.

You have to be VERY patient and be willing to die A LOT if you want to beat this game, here are my recommendations:

(Scratch everything I put here previously): Play Survivor. The story makes more sense, and even though it may be frustrating at times, it's worth it. It's the type of game that makes the journey so hard that when you finally finish it, it's extremely liberating.

Don't play Hunter (hard mode) until you beat the game, it is not what you'd expect.

Other than that, this is my third or fourth favorite game of all time still deciding if it's better than Hollow Knight in my eyes (Update: It is after Downpour, though I have faith that Silksong will be better than Rain World), it's absolutely beautiful, the AI is jawdropping, the environments are fantastic, and even though I had no idea what was happening, the ending almost brought me to tears (mainly because of how god damn difficult it was getting there, and because the art was so damn good).



Absolutely fantastic game.

You have to learn the traits of each type of creature. In fact, each individual creature has it's own personality. You can befriend a predatory lizards by bringing them food, but be careful. If you manage to take the mask off a vulture, the lizards other mid-range predators will fear you, but the maskless vulture will chase you down. If you see the scavengers raising their spears, you know they don't trust you, and if you are too aggressive to them, them might send some members out to kill you.

Rain world puts you in a situation where you are a lost little dude with no idea what/where the hell they are, hungry stomach, a world that you don't understand, and all you have to survive is a pile of debris and your wits.

This game is hands down the most refreshing game I've played in a long time. I don't think there is or will be another experience that is as lively, brutal, adventurous, mysterious, and amazing as this game. Went into this game mostly blind and, though it took quite a bit of time to get through this way, it was worth the journey. The replayability of this game is also amazing since there's many things to uncover you might have missed, plenty of slug cats to play as, and a fairly lively workshop and content community. 

I'd highly recommend everyone give this a shot, and even if it's not for you, it's a beautiful game that is unlike anything I've ever played.

imagine if super meat boy had a maximum timer after wich you die no matter what, and every time you die you lose 20 minutes of progress, at many points in time that's how rainworld feels

the game is just counter intuitive, even when you're supposed to learn how to play with just watching, it's like they set rules and then made them not work 50% of the time

-this game requires patience to do most things, yet you can't take your time because you would either be being chased by a creature half of the time, or about to get killed by the ingame timer (wich is randomized each day, so you may just have to suck it up and waste another day idling before you have enough time to go trough) and if you instead try to rush, there will always be an enemy camping to the other side of the zone, wich you have to either waste time that you don't have to go trough, or risk it and do a 50/50 of dying and starting again or finally crossing

-this game wants you to learn, yet everything (item spawns, enemy spawns, enemy movement, and enemy AI) is randomized every day, you may get lucky and go trough a zone completelly unharmed, or have to deal with bad spawns, and waste another hour or so dying and respawning over and over, the game also punishes experimenting, since dying lowers you karma level, something crucial to go between each zone of the game

-the tools you have are there, but way too limited, you have 3 slots to hold stuff, in most zones one will be occupied to hold an item you need to traverse the zone, and if you are trying to discover the lore of the game so will be the 3rd one (wich mind you, discovering the lore involves an awfull ammount of backtracking) you may say this is expectable since one is doing a hard challenge put on themselves, but when i have to go trough three times the ammount of torture just to understand what's happening ingame i'd just skip the lore part and try to reach the ''ending'' of the game instead

besides that, you have the most useless map you could ever imagine, why would you divide it in three different parts? why would you make the player's experience harder in anything that isn't the main aspect of the game itself instead of what counts as one of their only tools? eventually i got so tired of dealing with it that i had to sink into the wiki (getting spoiled major things too, because lord forbbid you get to discover something yourself in the game about exploration without walking 10 hours) just to know where should i even go to begin with, the lack of context and the  minimal help of the overseer didn't get me too far last time (he's literally gone for half of the zones you traverse, cmon)

the game is just a slug (no pun intended, i love slugcats) and at more than one point it just feels sisyphean to jump from one savespot to another, i know that more than one will say this game IS meant to be hard and that im tilting madly, i know the game is fun but if there's no progress after four hours maybe others can enjoy it but i cannot

TLDR: sometimes, this feels like the complete opposite of a game with how it expects you to handle it

i have bought the base game and the downpour expansion, and i will probably keep playing it further until i get to finish it if possible, until then, my looks on the game are not good

and to whoever says skill issue, go back to your cbt session or whatever game you need to defend next",1694878967,1694878967,False,1,0,0.450468003749847412,2,True,False,False

Rain World is absolutely gorgeous and mechanically amazing but with how punishing and grindy at times (if you're bad, which you will be if you just installed the game) I could not absolutely bear to play it more than 2 cycles at a time and did not enjoy more than a handful of minutes of my total playtime.
If you like incredibly punishing games with simple but very deep mechanics that are satisfying to learn and master, with stunningly good NPC AI and complex, interesting lore, you'll love it, but if you're not a part of the small ammount of people that would realistically enjoy the game you will absolutely loathe your time with it.
I don't recommend it to the majority of people, but I can see and understand where its fans are coming from.

I promise I'm not one of those people that NEEDS constant stimulation or something exploding spectacularly on-screen every couple minutes, but the lack of any kind of positive feedback for exploring just wasn't much fun -- it felt like all I would ever find were more enemies.

With wheels it is a wheelchair[14] and when hung from above, a swing. A chair for more than one person is a couch, sofa, settee, or ""loveseat""; or a bench. A separate footrest for a chair is known as an ottoman, hassock or pouffe.

The chair is known for its antiquity and simplicity, although for many centuries it was an article of state and dignity rather than an article of ordinary use. ""The chair"" is still extensively used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings.

If you were drawn into the worlds of Ori and the Blind Forest, or Hollow Knight, you will definitely enjoy this one as well. To describe it in few words, it is dynamic and powerful in presentation. Very highly recommend.


At Length: This game hits a lot of marks, and while it does have some shortcomings, they're overshadowed by the things it does right.

What does it do right?

- Procedural animation. A technique full of technical challenges to implement, but done so fantastically in Rain World. Every creature in the game moves according to how it's able to, rather than a pre-set animation. Creatures can lunge, flap, lose their grip on surfaces, ect. This will also have an effect on your Slugcat's own movement.

- Environmental storytelling. Adventurous types will find plenty of ways to get lost, and along the way, see interesting sights and learn a little bit more about the world they inhabit. There are mysteries to uncover, but I won't spoil them here. 

- Music. James Primate and the rest of their team have created a soundtrack that not only supplements the environmental storytelling, but engages the player with the events on screen. The choice to make the music dynamic itself lends greatly to that effect. I often listen to the tracks while not playing. 

- Content rich DLC. Buy downpour with this game. It vastly expands the content of the original game in all aspects. More music, more areas to explore, more Slugcats, more lore. Do it. 

- Art and design. Rain World is a work of art in and of itself. There are places I needed to stop passing through and just soak in. There are moments when I felt overwhelmed. At some point I cried. In addition to evoking emotions though, I was also impressed by the range of designs of creatures and elements of the environment. Enjoy such classics like: bees that tie you down, and an insect half the size of a Toyota Corolla. 

- Skill and exploration are rewarded. The game is a journey, and not one just based on travel. You'll figure out what things means and how to use them, and it's a good feeling when you do. Knowledge and a practiced hand are king when it comes to survival. There's also cool little things to find throughout the world. Challenges and expedition mode add more levels of knowledge and skill testing.

- Local co-op. Not a feature I make use of personally, but I see the value it in for others. Support games that bring people together. Jolly cooperation makes cold nights in the shelters better for everyone. Online co-op is not an official feature, but one that's possible through Steam Remote Play. Since that's a direct connect feature, you might experience some lag when the person you're connecting to is far away. 

- Community. The Rain World community kicks ass. So many talented folks, kind folks, supportive folks. Some of those folks went on to put their love and hard work into the DLC. The community is active and positive. Join the Rain World discord, there you can talk about your journey through the game, see the art that's posted every day, discuss lore, why Saint is the best Slugcat, or talk about mods.

- Mods. In addition to an active community overall, there's also an active modding community. Turn a terrifying foe into a clown, add whole regions to your game, or find entirely new Slugcats with new looks and mechanics. Be sure to thank or support those good nerds that make the content. 

What does it not do right?

- The game is unfair. That's not me complaining, there are points where circumstances align to destroy your Slugcat in sudden and sometimes funny ways. But sometimes it's just out of your control. It's the nature of the game, being as dynamic as it is. This might be cause for frustration among some people, and unfortunately, it's not helped by what I'll mention in the next section. However, it's an important part of overall feel of the game. I'll let you discover why.

- Controls can be somewhat vague, and the immobile camera can cause lack of awareness beyond the edge of the screen. The controls for the game are simple, but there's a lot of different movements you can do. A series of buttons you press can mean something if you're standing on the ground, and something else when you are climbing a pipe. This usually isn't an issue until you're hanging over a pit. It's remedied with practice, calm input, or changing your settings. There are also audio cues that help with the camera issue. Additionally, quality of life mods exist for both of these issues.

To conclude: I cannot recommend this game enough. It's beautiful, there's cool game design elements to it, the story is evocative, the music invigorating. Creatures and places that firmly belong in our memory. A vast, mysterious, terrifying world to explore... and through it all, you. The humble Slugcat. Going WAWA and inconveniencing calculators. Only those folks who don't like platformers at all, or get incredibly frustrated easily, would I say your experience with the game could be hit or miss. But otherwise, buy it. Play it. Support it. Become Slugcat. Can you feel it? The spear in your little hands? Your body squirmshing through the pipe? The wag of your tail? The- no, get back... leave me... it's too late, I'm... the rains are coming... I must...  I... WAAAAAAAAAAA!

You can enter an area to find a fight already taking place, or a predator can grab you and be dragging you back to its den only for an apex predator to grab them and fly off with them. Everything is unscripted and happens organically, resulting in a world that feels unpredictable and truly alive.

-A very large and detailed world to explore, with tons of variation between areas and challenges that will test your abilities. The environment is absolutely gorgeous to look at feels overwhelmingly atmospheric at times. All of the areas have something to offer and are a joy to explore.

-A hauntingly beautiful narrative and rich lore in a fascinating world. This game has one of the most unique and interesting worlds I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It feels truly alien and unknowable.

-Replayability in the form of multiple campaigns (even more with the DLC) that take you through an altered version of the world as a different character at a different point in the timeline, with their own goals.

My child told me they have cancer and I said ""rain world reference"" and he immediately died. I got a severe drought warning on my phone and my children cried as I said ""rain world reference."" There will soon be a flood one day, and I know then, I just know, that my time will shine.

I tried to explain the lore to my children and one had an aneurysm, along with my fifth wife. The others have no recollection of that day, rain world reference included. 

I try to rid myself of this affliction, but the very act of ridding myself of the game draws me that much more into it, much like the ancients in their unending cycle of life and death. What a terrible fate I have found myself in, forever trapped in the cyclical nature of my own making, and forever alone in facing it. A drug that cannot be flushed out of the system. A system that acts like a drug. The game reflects on the unending of all things, and the madness that comes with the imprisonment of eternity. And I sit here, writing this, trapped in a hell of my own design, driven mad by the unending nature of my prison.

Despite all this, Rain World is still not a perfect game, some of your deaths might feel cheap and it's heavy reliance on rng may feel a bit bullshit at times, but as time goes on and you gain more experience, this will stop being an issue.

The atmosphere in this game is so good, You go from ancient civilizations, to abandoned cities, to beaches all of which are amazing. There is even an area where if you have not done something yet, you have to wander through nothing but darkness, where the only noise, and light is the enemies, making you use the enemies to navigate around.

Basically, it evokes morbid games like Limbo and INSIDE, but gives you the chance to fight back and thrive; But make no mistake: The instant deaths and opressing atmosphere are still there.

The sooner you know your starting place, the quicker you can challenge the ones above you in the food chain.

Usually in order for a 2d platformer to be fair, controls should be tight and it should be clear how you interact with objects. 
stuff such as the pipes that you have to crawl into, the items you throw, the branches you grapple, they're all a hat toss if what you want will even work. thrown objects can't be aimed and it's hard to tell if it's being thrown -x or +x. coming out of a pipe onto a grappled edge will sometimes just cause you to fall, needing to repeat an entire portion of the map. Multiple times. Pressing down in order to start a long jump will sometimes cause you to just walk off an edge instead. All this on top of having maybe 5 minutes between rain storms, having to collect 7 pieces of food with the horrible aiming (god forbid you think that the tiny dragonflies that light up and act like prey are prey), and being far away from a shelter trying to make the same jump 60 times because this time its chosing to grapple and climb onto the pipe you're trying to go into without your imput quickly made me decide to opt for a refund.

it captures the feeling of being part of a system and not on top.
Very RNG heavy witch I thing works well with the need to stay guarded for things as you won't know where things are at any time.

The failure gating isn't too too harsh since you can spend the next day cautiously gathering food building up your karma. 

A pensive slow game I think since you can't run through an area with getting to know it. Or You'll be ground to paste.

Far from the instant action, mindless shooter type games.

This ""game"" only has 90 pages of movement tech, a moving map where everyone evolves to specifically kill you. 
As well as rain.
I'm only 30 hours in; only just now getting to the last fluffy one with a long tongue. Now I have a panic attack when I even think of rain.
Also if you get this game. DLC makes the game 3x bigger, think of the base game as a demo. That's how big the dlc is. So for the cheap price of $40, (or $15 during sales) You can get 50 hours of game play that never goes stale.
Also this is trying to be as spoiler free as possible, because this is one of those games you need to go in with a fresh mind, and jump into it. Follow the yellow thing with an eye, and good luck. REMEMBER NO SPOILERS!

I do recommend the game if u WANT to play it, it is fab and the DLC is also super fun. The base game consists of three cats, one being easy mode (Monk), the base one (Survivor)  which i recommend playing unless u really have skill issue and then (i think) if u beat the game as either one u unlock one which is more speed run and survival based (Hunter). It took me personally 20h to beat Survivors campaign and it was really fun, i did resort to using a tutorial at some parts cause i felt mega stuck and i recommend u do the same if stuck but other than that just play the game, OR DONT PLAY IT AS U WANT! 
From there i tried the DLC adding 5 new slug cats with their own ""Powers"" quirks is if u will,
Gourmand, fat, can craft, can body slam enemies. Artificer, keeps getting hunted can EXPLODE!. Rivulet, super fast cat neat mobility but the RAIN comes sooner. Spearmaster, infinite spears, no mouth, eats with spears and Saint, Pacifist, long tongue and then God hood eventually.
I didnt beat all the campaigns yet but the one i did play are super fun loved them, i did however try all the slug cats and each one is unique (except Monk he is just easy mode) and great fun. The world is huge and the art style is stunning, really pretty and fun game.
Some downsides i do have to say is that the game can get u omega stuck and not soft lock but ur just lost u got no clue what u are doing, and thats normal i fixed that with a tutorial to get me back on track, and also the game is simply unfair sometimes lol and thats part of the charm but sometimes is SUCH bs.

Simply, only get the game if u are intrested and are willing to push through and play it otherwise dont bother cause u will not enjoy it. I do recommend the DLC but get it only after you have completed Survivors or Monks campaign. Very nice game.",1694285246,1694285246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the music and the art and the atmosphere are beautiful and the vibes are immaculate.
the ecosystem is complex and interesting and immersive and really feels alive.
the community is awesome and the dlc and mods add so much to the experience.
the story and worldbuilding is very interesting and it raises lots of questions, and the game will not give you the answers easily. you will not understand much at all on your first playthrough. it will take hundreds of hours of exploring every corner of this enormous world over many campaigns, and lots of curiosity and determination to piece together the story. (or look on the wiki if you just value your time)
the movement system is very complex but you must learn all of it on your own (or look up the nearly 100 page long document that documents it)

this game is an experience, but it is certainly not for everyone.
it is hard and extremely punishing. 
the tutorial teaches you only the bare minimum you need to survive and you have to work everything else out for yourself.
this game does not care for you. it does not value your time or your sanity. it will not forgive you for your mistakes. as one user has said, it does not hold your hand; it stomps on your fingers and watches them bleed. it is unfair. you will die. a lot. you will only progress through determination and strategy.
other than yellow, there is not much direction and you will often be lost.
as you progress through the game enemies will get stronger and more numerous and you will stay as weak as you started, so you must use the skills and experience you gained on your journey.
and all the challenge is worth it. the first time i reached the top of 'the wall' was the first time i have ever felt awe and when i finished the final campaign was the first time a game made me cry.
it was worth every moment.

Perhaps.

I’ll start with the details. The pixel art looks incredible. The sound design is great. It’s rare to see the full potential of procedural animation realized, but Rain World does it. Every part of this world looks and feels alive. The excellent AI of the game’s various inhabitants contributes to that as well.

The gameplay is a more complicated topic. That’s not a cop-out way of saying the game isn’t fun to play – it is. But it’s also infuriating. Death comes for you easily and often unfairly. It’s not a roguelike, but if you can’t stand roguelikes I would hesitate to recommend this game to you.

The controls are in a similar situation. They’re not bad, and there’s an incredible depth of skill that can be achieved with them – once you’re done exploring this game on your own, check out the wiki’s movement guides. I’ve come to enjoy the controls, but only after a great deal of frustration.

This frustration is a core part of Rain World. You could not tell the story that the developer is trying to tell, could not provide the profound experience that Rain World does, without this frustration.

All the same, I’d recommend to everyone that they enable the “Remix” plugin on the “Classic” preset immediately. The quality-of-life changes this gives are invaluable, and don’t diminish the experience in any way. The other options can be tried on a case-by-case basis.

The Downpour DLC is absolutely worth it, and enabling the “More Slugcats” plugin that it grants you access to right out of the gate will provide worthwhile additional content in all your playthroughs. You should start with Survivor, the white slugcat, regardless.

If you can stick with it through to the end, Rain World will absolutely be worth the time you put into it. 9/10.",1694110558,1694110558,True,94,0,0.886667013168334961,0,True,False,False

I really wish I could love this game, we have had lot of wonderful memories together. The art, the music, the memories~ 

But them I remember that every day it beats the piss out of me with its bare knuckles. 

Review at 22 hours in, still on my first run though this is normal from what I see. 

This isn't a hard because its challenging, though it has it's moments. what it is truly; is a creators vision not aligning with game design foundations. It's a GREAT vision, and although I've cut my life expectancy in half from the blood pressure, I love the good that's in this game. The issue stands that there are some serious game design faux pas embedded in the bones of this. Extreme punishment for failure, poor signposting (not talking about yellow), crucial mechanics are not explained. Crucify me if you like for this, but it's also a wiki game; just because something *can* be discovered in the game, doesn't mean it *will* be.

If the goal was to create an immersive experience around being a powerless part of nature; frustration is the enemy of immersion. There are ways to punish and reward the player for engaging with your creation that don't cause them to be frustrated and ""switch-off"". Instead, it chooses to ""reward"" you with an opportunity to experience the game for longer than 15 minutes without giving your head another contusion.

I will finish this game, and I plan to finish all the other stories as well; but it is a violently abusive relationship, and i can't in good conscience recommend anyone attempt to *play* this.

Watch an experienced play through, preferably without commentary. Or turn on all the remix mods to say ""fuck you"" to the devs for designing the default experience around the highest levels of play. 

I love this game for what it does right, great experience, great art, design, soundtrack. Terrible game play.

EDIT

I just completed the survivors story and, now I can only push my last point harder. This game would have been far more enjoyable had I not gone in blind. 

There were no answers in the core gameplay, you won't get your questions resolved. You have to extend your gameplay out across multiple characters or ludicrous fetch-quests, at which point the ""Big moments"" turn from being amazing spectacles and strong resolutions of a characters plot to:

[h1]This is a warning to those who plan to buy the game[/h1]


This game will absolutely[b] not hold your hand [/b]or[b] be kind to you [/b]

This game will [b]eat you alive[/b] and enjoy doing so.

It will feel [b]unfair and RNG based[/b], but that's how it is. It's supposed to feel RNG based, it's simulating an [b]environment[/b], not a planned layout.

Your movement will feel slippery and sluggish but you must remember; you're a [b]creature with faults[/b], not the [b]perfect war soldier[/b] or a [b]brave italian plumber[/b].

If you refuse to adapt or change your ways; [b]you will be punished accordingly by the environment[/b].

If you need to do research on the game before you buy and play, go ahead. Many argue you shouldn't, many argue you should; just pick your poison.


[b]I have too many friends (on my Steam List and IRL friends) who bought Rain World and:[/b]


[b]A) Stopped playing after the first hour or so[/b]


[b]B) Who asked me to play with/help them and learned nothing about how the game functions.[/b]
(Don't let this stop you from playing with friends though; if you like the feeling of having company, go ahead. What am I going to do, shut off your computer? Keep in mind though, the original experience was supposed to be played [b]Solo[/b])


If you truly are still planning to buy this game, watch gameplay of the first hour so you can determine if you should buy this game. Hell, if you have a friend(s) who likes the game (and has the DLC, since Co-Op is only featured [b]in the DLC[/b],) ask to remote play with them!

[b]A few key notes to keep in mind;[/b]

Demotivation is common and may occur often if you are not strong-willed and/or curious (those these traits may not be the sole reason why people are motivated to play the game.)

Keep your ears and eyes peeled. Listen for a change in the music.

If you do die, think of a way around your problems and don't suddenly blame the game for your fault; mistakes usually happen due to the player's lack of knowledge of game mechanics.",1671404020,1693940475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honest 9/10 if it wasn't for scav aimbot.

It's an unforgiving survival game where you will die, die, die, die again, die some more, and die even after you've put in 100+ hours. This isn't a possibility. It's a promise. You may wonder what the point of all this dying and struggle is. Why you're here, why you're trying so hard for seemingly no purpose. But the reason is this: whatever you want it to be.

Yes, there's a story. But the game isn't going to go out of its way to give it to you. You'll have much more fun if you go in with the attitude of a sandbox game, finding your own niche and enjoyment in the mechanics and game world. Whether it be killing wildlife, taming wildlife, exploring the many beautiful environments, scavenging for any scraps of lore you can find, learning all the movement tech... 
It's a beautiful and charming game. But it's not going to be for you if you can't find a reason to hit ""continue"" even after your tenth death in a row to same exact dumbass lizard.

If you're still reading and considering this game, here's a few spoiler-free tips to finding the story. :]
- Go as far RIGHT and UP as you possibly can. You can choose to go right first, or up first, but both paths will be unforgiving. The only difference is how many chances the game gets to punish you. 
- You'll probably find something important in you go straight right. It won't be helpful until you go as far up and right first. 
- Colored pearls have lore in them. 
- The little yellow eye-guy is only helpful for general directions, 'cause it sucks at giving you specific ones. Ignore it if you're lost.",1693392577,1693392577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rain World is tough, it's not for everyone nor does it hold your hand. This is by design and if you stick with it, you WILL be rewarded with a rich and emotional story.

It's a game about learning and surviving. You'll be dying a LOT, but especially in the first campaigns, The Survivor and The Monk, there is little consequences for it aside being stooped down a few levels of Karma.

But each new cycle you show up, you will have learned more and you will get better.

Don't forget, you are just a lost, young Slugcat after all. Survival has to be learned. If you give yourself the time and patience, you'll have an unforgettable adventure ahead.

The game also has an absolutely fantastic modding community. Thanks to mods like ""Dress my Slugcat"" I was able to play as my own characters, which was honestly a big bonus.
There is also ""Cutscene Slugcats"" that are vanilla cats reimagined to be closer to how their artwork looks and it's amazing.

It has lots of unusual decisions which may seem awful at the first glance, but the deeper you get into the game, the more you realize how absolutely brilliant is each of these moments at making it feel like a brutal and unforgiving ecosystem, which is exactly what devs aimed to do. The slugcat doesn't get any new abilities throughout the game, rather it is the player who learns to survive in this world by all means necessary, up to the point where it eventually becomes its new home. And that once again precisely represents the plot, where the player is just a little slugcat that is completely unaware of all the dangers in this new, cruel world, not understanding a single thing at first, and then learning more and more over the time, until it eventually doesn't even need to go back to its previous home anymore.

The artstyle in this game is beautiful, and despite the relatively simple graphics, it still looks amazing. [spoiler]I know the most popular example of the game's stunning graphics is the top of The Wall, but I would rather say the artstyle is at its peak during the entirety of Sky Islands, especially in that glowy rooms (you know the ones ig)[/spoiler]

The lore is great as well, though you will probably have to watch a few videos explaining it because the game itself doesn't really explain it, in fact trying to straight up hide it from the player. I won't talk about the lore much because I want everyone reading this to play the game without seeing any spoilers so they can enjoy (and suffer) it fully.

Overall, Rain World isn't for everyone, but if you approach it with the right mindset and have some patience for the first few hours, you're gonna have some of the best experience of your entire life. And also, the Downpour dlc fixed most of the moments that were straight up frustrating and unfair, so be sure to check it out.

originally, i got this game i think 3 years ago? but because of my old laptop the game was more laggy than i can handle, i only got the the second to last room in the first area leading to the next one. Now, however, i have a new laptop, more experience with platformer's, and the privilege to bond over the game with friends. I dove back in, full force, and dont regret it.
The art direction is amazing, the enemy ai feels natural (with a few exceptions but nothing major), and the story, god's the story is something you wont expect.

But i will be honest, at times you will hate the game, you will feel anger, despair, tension, and fear. You will gnash your teeth at the unfairness of it all and wonder if you should quit. But thats also the appeal. You are prey in a world of predators, the world is against you and rarely works with you. There will be ones who welcome you, but not for long. While the vanilla game has so much content, downpour adds even more. Enriches the game even further.

The DLC adds a lot of content, with many new characters with unique playstyles and stories, as well as new game modes which add tons of replayability. I somewhat dislike aspects of the DLC content, with Spearmaster's campaign having many text logs which I find annoying compared to the more natural storytelling of the base game. The Remix options I also find to be a bit too skewed towards lowering the difficulty through game and UI tweaks - there are 3 presets and I find even the ""Vanilla"" one to be a bit much IMHO, but that can be changed by adjusting the individual settings. I personally wouldn't recommend using the Remix options on a first playthrough. Modding support looks to be great, with Workshop support and a settings page in the main menu to adjust individual mod options.

The base game's main strength but also greatest weakness is it's obtuseness; you are left mostly on your own to find out what you need to do and how to get there. This results in a frustrating yet rewarding first playthrough. There are some areas (such as Farm Arrays), where a new player has no idea what they need to do to move forward, which can either ruin the experience (by them giving up or googling the solution) or be extremely satisfying when they solve it.

Along the way find various other creatures to feed on, fight, team up with, run from, etc. 
There are 8 different slugcats, each with their unique gimmick. They all also have a different story that happens at a different time. The world and locations are the same but seeing all the changes in the environment at a different point in the timeline is easily the best part of the game. Absolute peak environmental storytelling.


Your first run in this game will mostly just be like a rage game where you'll be dying alot until you master the platforming, the layout of the map and rng is in your favor. 
You need to really go out of your way to find actual lore. Your character will go through their own journey but it's not really related to the bigger picture.
But all the characters you unlock after that have a role to play and bring change to the world one way or another. Change which you can experience by the other characters that come afterward along the timeline. Its a very unique experience no other game come close to recreate.",1692575245,1692575245,True,1,0,0.52651512622833252,0,True,False,False

This game is brutal. Not just hard, a lot of the game is actively unfair. Enemies spawn in random locations, dying sets you further back than progressing pushes you forward, and it hides a lot of important information from you. But there's something refreshing about all that. The game doesn't want you to succeed, and it doesn't care if you fail. It doesn't feel like it's hostile, so much as... indifferent. Enemies will ignore you if something easier to catch is near them. They'll fight over resources, or just because. A lot of the game is observing enemy patterns. Almost like you're part of a broader ecosystem, which is a feeling I can't say a lot of other games have given me.

Instead of doing anything interesting when you die, the game takes away one level of karma, which has a max level of 5. All karma is used for is opening karma gates, and their sole existence is to stop the player's progression if they've died. Considering how easy it is to die to something off screen, it just makes the game feel so much more frustrating then it has any right to be. 

Fortunately, you can disable the karma requirement for gates in the remix menu, and I highly suggest you do should you decide to play this game. Aside from karma however, the game as mentioned before is pretty bs a lot of the time, enemies camping in locations you need to go to in order to progress is a common sight, and unless you have a nice even strip of ground you can basically forget about combat, as there is no aim assist or any aiming whatsoever outside of basic left/right.

In order to actually beat the game though, you have to do by far one of the worst platforming sequences I've ever had the displeasure of playing. Basically you're in a zero gravity area and have to jump between vines to vines avoiding these big spider things and any terrain with blue ""x""s. If you touch them, it's insta death, and there's no checkpoint for like 15 screens. Gravity randomly switches on and off, and even when you jump there's a chance all your momentum gets eaten. This part of the game really does just feel like it's padding for time, and I ended up not finishing it since it's just not fun to play. 

Oh and you remember that karma requirement disable option? Yeah it doesn't work on the ""Gate"" in the final area of the game, you have to unlock the extra 5 karma levels by doing this garbage platforming area. The worst part? The ending is a 20 minute room where all you do is hold down. No fast travel option either, so when you get to this point and realise you're not allowed through, get ready to have to go 5 hours to and from (each, not combined) to the zero gravity area, then back to the ending area.

Final verdict? Just watch a youtube video of the full game. The gameplay consists of mindlessly walking with the occasional avoiding of enemies, or sitting around waiting for an enemy camping a choke point to either go away or for it to kill you. Instead of wasting 32$ on this, you could instead buy Hollow Knight AND Terraria and get significantly more fun out of either of those games.",1598466765,1692335557,False,0,0,0.475764662027359009,0,True,False,False

This was due to a lack of knowledge. The game isn't complex, but it doesn't teach you in the way most games do. You have to learn, and my recommendation is to try to eat or experiment with everything you find. The movement system is very complex and I don't understand most of the tricks you can do, but basic things like backflips and dropping items is something the game will not teach you but you should work out how to do.

The world is large. Even larger with DLC. You may find you have spent a lot of time travelling for nothing, and you have to be ok with that; the game has no character based progression, so if you go somewhere not needed for the story you are wasting your time, except for that your knowledge of the map will grow. You may feel like you're softlocked in some cases, but that is almost definitely due to your inexperience in dealing with the situations you're presented with, and you will overcome it. Do not anger the noodle flies.

When you start the game, a gooberous creature will lead to towards something. Know that there is little there of direct benefit to you, so expect to have to turn back. But I would recommend following anyway.

The DLC triples what you get out of the game so I believe it is definitely worth it. 6 (well, actually 7) more campaigns. If you found your first playthrough painful, I think you'll find the next ones are much more enjoyable as you learn more and more about how to beat the challenges the game throws at you. Even though the game gets harder it'll feel easier. Vultures become much less scary when you realise how sluggish their attacks are :)",1692198929,1692198929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I adore the fact that the world of Rain World just does not care about you. You're but a creature that exists in this world, but if you did not - nothing much would change. The cycles would continue as they had, just without you.

The combat is lovely, it's very carnal and basic, but we're basic creatures, sometimes fighting other basic creatures. Despite this the combat is well done, it's nice to get into fights, it's nice trying to learn how a creature behaves to avoid it.

The controls are amazing as well. So many mechanics that you simply learn by doing or by discovering them accidentally. The game provides you with very little information, you have to learn the rest.

The base Remix for Quality of Life things has tips and tricks during loading screens. After playing around 30 hours without it, it felt really patronizing after I turned it on for it to tell me things that I had learned the ""hard way"". I would really suggest playing with the tips and tricks turned off at first, and if you feel frustrated playing the game, turn them on.

Even using online resources it is damn near impossible to navigate and to know whether you're making progress or if you are going in the wrong direction, leading to hours of backtracking. The game is criticised for its difficulty, but the real difficulty is knowing where to go. It's fair to be killed if you play poorly, but most of the game is just spent dying over and over again in the same difficult spots, ruining any chance for the game to be immersive. Would recommend as a cheaply made free game, would not recommend as a 50 dollar game after DLCs are purchased.

Edit: (Mild Ending Spoilers Ahead)
After completing the game I have changed my mind, the game is even worse than I thought. The ending is dragged on so much longer than it needs to be and is not well guided. I spent ten minutes swimming down (you are supposed to do at the ending) and gave up because I assumed that the ending of a game wouldn't have you hold down for ten minutes. I then swam back up only to realise 10 minutes later that that doesn't work either. I then swam back down 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes before finally making it to the swimming simulator 2 where I had to swim down another 10 minutes. Then the game ended abruptly with me having no idea what it was trying to convey in the ending cut scene other than some kind of happy ending. Needless to say I would strongly not recommend this game for it's poor design, lack of guidance, grind heavy aspects, and utterly insane price tag.",1690842552,1692129472,False,3,1,0.482300907373428345,0,True,False,False

Is it pretty? Yes.
Is the AI technically impressive? Absolutely.
Does the game punish every failure and mistake like an abusive parent beating their child with a belt for getting the wrong size wrench out of the toolbox. Yeah pretty much.

The wrench analogy is appropriate, because this game is RNG heavy so it's hard to know what the ""right"" thing to do is.

The ""Karma"" system as its called isn't some oopsy woopsy mistake, it completely ruins the game and should never have been added to begin with. Why does dying REVERT PROGRESSION? What game does that, why would any game do that? It's like they made crashing a game and losing 2 hours of progress because you forgot to save an official mechanic.

Oh you died? Guess you need to go an entire day gathering food and you better not die again or you backslide even further. 

There's a reason so many positive reviews need to frontload the ""This game isn't for everyone"" line. It's because the game is too opaque for most people, and that's a failure of the game, not a quirk. It doesn't even teach you about the karma system you have to fucking look that shit up so you'll be confused why you're losing progress at first to begin with.

To gain Karma you must hibernate successfully. This can take a good amount of time depending on how much you need to farm. HOWEVER dying makes you lose a Karma level.  So you could die faster than you gain since a lot of things are instant death, I get flustered at the loss, and fail even harder and now I have karma level 1 and the door I need to go through requires 5, ugh.

to make matters worse is if you have a busy life and need to quit midway, you lose karma, crash? lose karma. So, I'd recommend getting a mod that permanently fortifies your karma so you won't have to deal with this struggle and turn it off when you decide to do expeditions.

As infuriating and difficult as the game can be sometimes, the sheer amount of effort, style, and thought put into every enemy, creature, and environment makes up for it about as much as a million dollars would be as compensation for destroying your car. The story is vague, but made clear(ish) through environmental storytelling. I mean, I haven't felt this much wonder towards a game since I played Hollow Knight, especially after getting the (without going into spoilers) ""Ascension"" ending. I can easily understand why this game isn't for everyone, as only 9.8% (at the time of me writing this review) of all players have gotten the ""Ascension"" ending, but I can assure you that it was amazing for almost everyone who has. It's slow pace, and obscure mechanics, as well as unknown creature behaviors, can lead to feeling helpless, and at the bottom of the food chain. The largest struggle I had with the game was learning the mechanics and trying not to rage quite during situations like dying over 20 times in a single area. This game doesn't tell you much, but for every unique death, and biome explored, and every mechanic discovered, you learn. I could honestly gone on for a very long time about this game, but I will wrap it up with this....
If you love exploration, well thought out worlds, games with passion put into them, or just love a challenge, PLEASE play this game, and do it BLIND (I seriously can't stress this enough, don't look up stuff about it).

The less you know before playing, the better. Keep outside help, especially a wiki, to a minimum, as information is the crux of progression in this game. Don't stop yourself completely from seeking it, though, as the ""no-spoilers"" grift I'm going for is not completely inflexible.

With gorgeous pixel-art visuals inspired by graffiti, Rain World is filled with death and mystique, so going in with a fatally curious mindset is absolutely for the better. One of the game's standout choices is how far it goes to connect the player to their avatar—the game hands out nearly zero information beyond what the slugcat could believably know. The player's own abilities, in a similar fashion, are rudimentarily universal to a point where they can initially feel obtuse; it crams a lot into just three keys. Tutorialization is kept to a minimum, which can compound with alien systems like the movement and lead to death and frustration.
However, it is this that captured me and transformed the game into being about learning to survive and master a once-utterly alien ecosystem through your numerous deaths.

[Slight spoilers for game-play] [Slight story spoilers]
This is a pretty wordy review so TLDR dot-points are at the bottom.

[IMMERSIVE WORLD AND DIFFICULTY]:

A massive part of Rain World is how immersive it is. You're not supposed to feel like some kind of hero or protagonist that is all powerful, instead the game wants to feel like you are a small insignificant part of the ecosystem that desperately struggles to survive in a cruel unpredictable world that doesn't care if you exist or not. You are not the center of the universe, you just happen to exist in it.

Rain World's difficulty is abnormally high because this feeds into the theme of you being just a normal wild animal surviving in the wild. After all it wouldn't make sense for a normal member of a small omnivorous species to suddenly flip into an apex predator that can survive anything. In the real world nature is unfair, cruel, uncaring, unfeeling, and brutal thus the game imitates this to be as immersive as possible.

You play as a Slugcat which despite the name is more similar to a sewer rat with human level intelligence than anything else. Even though you are capable of throwing spears and rocks, you were not built for combat. The vast majority of hostile creatures in the game can one-shot you, so you're expected to use your brain to outsmart and narrowly escape from predators. Although every predator is capable of dying and you can use various weapons (spears, the grenades crafted by Scavengers, rocks, Jellyfish, etc) combat can be extremely difficult at  first, especially if you haven't mastered the controls.

There are some games that have worlds claiming to be harsh and claiming that you're a normal nobody whereas in the actual game-play you're an overpowered god among ants, which can feel quite jarring and take you out of the immersion. Whereas the game-play of Rain World is completely consistent with the lore which helps a lot with it's immersion.

Even though I sometimes find the game infuriating, a part of me loves the feeling of slowly mastering the game and eventually triumphing over obstacles that at first felt impossible.

[ART]:

Even though pixel art doesn't allow for hyper-realistic extreme detail for every single blade of grass and speck of dirt, the atmosphere, colour pallet, architecture, and lighting all come together to make an extremely beautiful experience that more than makes up for the lack of detail.

[AI BEHAVIOR]:

Every creature in this game has it's own unique AI that makes them feel like they're real animals. There's an element of randomness to their behavior that I feel has been perfectly balanced. 
In games with elements of randomness it's important to strike a good balance, if there wasn't any randomness at all then you would be able to perfectly predict everything long before it happens, and If there's way too much randomness then it would feel arbitrary and inconsistent. Rain World's creatures do have certain patterns in their behavior that you can use to make general plans, but there's still enough unpredictability to keep you on your toes. After all, in the real world animals tend to follow patterns of behavior but it's impossible to consistently predict everything an animal will do.

Every creature in every section of the map is constantly being simulated regardless of whether you're near them or not, thus making the game feel even more immersive since in the real world animals don't just stop moving or existing whenever you're far away from them. Again, you are not the main character, each creature has it's own life that doesn't revolve around you. 
You would think that this would impact the frame-rate but I use the lowest settings and am playing on an old laptop (I don't know the specs but it's definitely not a gaming laptop) and the frame-rate has remained consistently smooth at all times.

[CONTROLS]:

The limited number of keys used makes the controls seem easy at first but there is an extremely wide variety of hidden movement techniques, tricks, and combinations that the game doesn't tell you about (the loading screen sometimes tells you some things but I'm pretty sure it doesn't tell you everything).
Learning to master the controls is difficult and feels a bit clunky but thankfully there are online documents and YouTube videos explaining how to do a variety of things such as back-flips, chaining rolling, sliding, throwing spears vertically, climbing poles really fast, and much more.

[SETTING AND DIRECTION]:

I'm not going to give any spoilers about the endings, what the Echos are, what caused The Rains, the exact dialogue of ""Five Pebbles"" and the exact dialogue of ""Looks to the Moon"" but I will give an introduction and description of the setting.

This game is on a planet that is not earth and I'm pretty sure the game never mentions earth. You are a Slugcat, a small omnivorous animal that lives in packs and seem to canonically have an intelligence somewhat similar to primitive humans since they use spears to hunt Batflys, build nests, make drawings, understand instructions (they don't ever seem to talk or make noise so I don't know how they communicate with each other), and trade with a chimp-like species called Scavengers by giving them Pearls.
You were accidentally separated from your family during one of The Rains.

The setting is similar to the post-apocalyptic genre except it's set in what I assume is either hundreds or thousands of years after the extinction of a technologically advanced civilization of people called The Ancients. The world is filled with atmospheric areas that have crumbled ruins, rusted metal structures, un-powered machines, disconnected pipes, broken poles and deteriorated scaffolding.

Your main goal is to survive but you can also explore the environment and there are two ""characters"" you can interact with. They are ""Five Pebbles"" and ""Looks to the Moon"", I'm not sure if they technically count as cyborgs but they're both city-sized supercomputers at least partially made of living materials and genetically modified organisms. They talk to you, providing exposition about the lore, and giving you instructions on how you could get an ending.

The game is called Rain World because there is a cycle of brief clear weather you can survive in followed by a tsunami of extremely heavy rain so strong that it crushes you if you're directly under it and so abundant that it completely floods underground areas. You need to eat enough food to be able to hibernate inside of little mechanical safe-rooms that lock up tight when you hibernate while you wait for The Rains to end and the underground areas to drain. 

[TLDR dot-points]:
[[Things I love about Rain World]]:
- You're not some special main character with god-like power, you are just a weak part of nature which is strangely humbling and refreshing.
- It's extremely immersive and feels like a realistic and believable alien ecosystem that truly feels alive.
- Even though the game is very difficult, that makes it more immersive and I like the feeling of getting more skilled over time and finally succeeding.
- The art is beautiful and very atmospheric.
- The AI has a nice balance of randomness, it's not too predictable and not too wildly unpredictable.

[[Things I dislike about Rain World]]:
- If you want to master the controls like doing back-flips, chaining rolls, and throwing spears vertically you will probably need to look up a guide.
- The game doesn't hold your hand so without an online guide you'll probably end up aimlessly exploring all over the place if you want to progress the story.
- You can only store one item in your stomach at a time and you can only carry one spear at a time.

Not everyone will enjoy Rain World, but I love this game and would encourage you to give it a try.",1691585985,1691585985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- The story is so good. Deeply hopeless, but life continues on whether it's wanted or not. Past mistakes that caused great harm. A lot of hidden lore to find if you look for it and studiously bring it to be studied. And if you don't care about all that, haha funny scug do flip.
- Everything feels very natural, this world truly does feel like surviving as a small creature near the bottom of the food chain. Enemy AI is done quite well, with most creatures feeling unique and you develop strategies around them. Seeing them for the first time is a great terrifying experience. Sometimes they trip and fall or get stuck, sometimes they fight each other. You aren't the main character (well, you are, but man it almost never feels like it and in a really good way).
- Movement system is unique and a lot of fun to learn
- The world is absolutely beautiful, the style is completely on-point of this post-apocalyptic lonely world
- The game is super frustrating at times, which sounds like a con, but it makes learning so much more satisfying
- Heaps of content* (much more with DLC but the base game story is still great)
- Beautiful music. It's on YouTube if you're curious, but it also fits the style really well and is just a damn bop.
- More that I've missed, it's just such a good game. I could rant about it for hours. If you have the money and have bothered reading this far, absolutely get it.

Cons:
- Some controls are a little unintuitive (like holding down and tapping shift to drop something which unfortunately ends with a lot of items dropped when trying to grab something while sliding down a pole)
- Sometimes the game does feel unfair, just because you get unlucky with where the creatures are. It feels more natural, though, than having them all follow set paths.
- Occasional bugs like falling out of the map (irritating), lizards rarely failing to path and spinning (funny, can be excused as a lizard behaviour) and an asset or two on my scug's body not loading (was a tad distracting but I died before I started worrying), but nothing that ruins the experience.
- God DAMMIT RAIN DEER. HURRY UP (thankfully these fools are confined to only a few areas in the game).",1691396818,1691396818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros:[/b] A slow pace experience game that has a grand world and story behind it's rather simple mechanics. You play as a slugcat, trying to complete each one's objective in a metroid-vania like world. But the big seller is that the game makes you feel like prey. Everything that could possible kill, harm or eat you will, and it's your objective to get pass all these while trying to learn about the world, eat enough to survive, and find shelter before the rains fall. The game does a great job of making you feel vulnerable without being unreasonable. Sometimes the deaths may feel unfair, but that's just how nature is. Caution is needed when exploring, watching and learning how creature interact, hell even learning how to tame some creatures to help you are all optional yet major parts of the game. Sure you can ignore all the nuance in the mechanics, but then you can play lesser games for the cheap and small hit of dopamine. Mastering the systems, learning all you can, and engaging in fun and unique ways really make this game. The art is fantastic as well, and the blends of styles are really quite interesting. The subtle soundtrack is absolute fitting and refreshing, never once did I feel the sound or atmosphere has hurt by it which is a rare feat these days.
[b]Cons:[/b] It can be unforgiving and unfair cause it is trying to simulate a realistic nature with all the AI and coding going on. Rage quitting can happen after a long string of losing all the Karma you earned over and over from cheap kills. 
[b]Recommend to:[/b] Patient folks who like deep worlds and interesting mechanics and ideas. Fan of folks who like simulations and AI based actions instead of predictable and expected results.
[b]Overall:[/b] Again, Indie devs nail it. Rain World is a beautiful peace of art that really deserves more attention then it got.",1691305293,1691305293,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game is a master at making you feel like you belong in the ecosystem, and is very atmospheric, drawing you in.
The AI is great, animations are uncannily fluid, and the environments are well designed and look very good.
However, in a game that's all about exploring, it's pretty cruel and unforgiving, and makes you do things over and over again due to the one shot dying present in all aspects of the game.
It's an extremely frustrating and difficult experience, but when you do make progress, it feels absolutely amazing.

It just feels like I'm fighting the movement of the character more than the actual enemies of the game. Why does it have to be 'z,' 'x,' and 'shift' with the arrow keys instead of the regular 'wasd' with the space bar? It's just so weird, and it doesn't help that every enemy in the game has jacked out movement. It's like I have to deal with these agile creature whilst also slamming my keyboard into my desk because that's how unorthodox the controls are. I don't get it. 
Sad part is I love the concept of navigating a complex ecosystem and having to deal with these unique situation with a variety of animals. I love every aspect of this game except for the fucking controls. Why should any player care about the world they're exploring if the controls make everything so sluggish? I feel like I'm pulling teeth just trying to figure out how to perform a simple wall jump after leaping off of a stick. So frustrating. 
Also, side note: Why do people draw similarities between this and Outer Wilds? They're on completely different ends of the gaming spectrum. The main appeal of this game initially for me was because I had seen people say they two were similar when they are very clearly not.

i have spent at least half of a year or even more playing this dumb silly game and i still pick it over most games i have in my library from how much replayability it has. 

Something else to mention , all of the campaigns are amazing , though they do sometimes lack stuff like for example:
-considering monk&survivor have an intro cutscene , others don't and it's a missed opportunity.-

The Downpour DLC is really good too and it has at least double the size of content , that the vanilla game had. As for the new slugcats , they're all amazing in their own ways , some might not stick with you and some you might instantly fall in love with.

If i could , i would write a more unbiased review but since the day i bought this game , it still manages to surprise me , make me hate it , rip my hair off and have fun. 

For people who have friends !! i recommend you to try out CO-OP , yes it may be buggy at times and steam together play is wacky , but if you do manage to get it working , CO-OP makes the game 100x times more fun and even more silly. (P.S. you'll need you/your friends to have controllers to play co-op , one player can be on keyboard and every other person on controllers , its weird but i'm not the one who created this game) And finally , yes , the mods for this game are really fun too and i mostly use the DMS mod (""Dress My Slugcat"") because all the OC and not OC slugcat designs look beautiful. The community can be a little annoying but i just don't interact with it, i recommend you doing the same too if you're afraid of communities. 

As my for my final word or something ? 8/10 , has its flaws and has its pros , all in all , great game. ALSO PLEASE , DON'T PUT ON ANY MODS BEFORE PLAYING ALL THE CAMPAIGNS , IT *WILL* RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO PLAYING WITHOUT MODS , JUST COMPLETE THE GAME AND THEN PUT ON YOUR SILLY LITTLE MODS.

Jokes aside, the game is great fun. Very challenging and absolutely frustrating at times, but it always feels like you can pass whatever challenge you've run into. The graphics and music complement each other beautifully and the game looks fantastic overall. The story is pretty compelling and makes you invested in your little slugcat.
However, this game is hard, especially at the beginning. And when I say hard, i mean very hard. The movement is hard to get used to, the game doesn't really tell you how to progress, and you're constantly getting beaten up by everything you come across.

I think that actually encapsulates rain world in a nutshell, a completely hostile world that wont hold your hand nor tell you if youre doing anything wrong, in any case just follow the little yellow guy because it really does show you the right way though navigating around can still be extremely confusing as the map i think mightve been made the way it is to be almost unreadable as its extremely hard to route out long distance travel as its pretty zoomed in and not layed out flat.
Apart from taking a wrong turn, fucking around and finding out,  the game is also not exactly supposed to be the definition of fun all around but rather a mix of emotions: frustration, confusion, fear, fascination and more as the developers went above and beyond to make the most gigantic map ive ever seen in a game that never misses in quality as the background and art is incredibly beautiful and diverse really selling the setting at all times.
At 20 hours i barely even got to scrape all systems the game has to offer and the incredibly diverse moveset that slugcat comes equipped at all times (which is never explained at all so good luck finding out all this junk without the remix menu option ""loading menu tips"") but is not exactly needed to beat the game, you're left at the mercy of predators if you dont learn to fully utilize all these secret techniques or the fact that [spoiler]theres a reputation system in the game which means you can tame lizards and other animals and then become a non prey to them (how tf are you supposed to learn this, welp by being creative enough to think you could tame them i guess lol) [/spoiler].
If you find any idea of being dropped into a fully living world and living out the expirience of being a vulnerable defenseless little creature at the mercy of everything around you then give the game a try and dont be scared to reset the game if needed, took me like 4 resets though thankfully all your maps are saved from any past attempts.

It's an immersive sim first and a platformer second; the virtual ecosystem this game creates through procedural animation and complex animal AI interactions does not care in the slightest about the player, and that's why I love it so much. The horrifying affronts to God you'll witness on your journey think and act unpredictably, and that makes certain scenarios a little unfair and sometimes impassable without simply waiting a few minutes for them to screw off.

And the difficulty doesn't stop there! The developers have cleverly hidden literal pages of some of the cleanest movement tech I've ever seen behind WASD + 2 buttons, some of which is required to traverse a select few routes. But if you ask most people, they'll say it's clunky because none of it is ever explained.

On top of that, the lore of this game is delivered via you choking down one of 30 hidden rocks, travelling across the entire treacherous world I just mentioned *on foot* to its easternmost point, and vomiting up said rock so that a Muppet WALL-E thing can read it to you and tell you that the divine wisdom you worked so hard to acquire is a Buddhist liquor store receipt.
 
There are also 8 different campaigns that offer wildly different experiences and take place at different points in the timeline. Interestingly, the 6 campaigns you *don't* have the ability to play immediately offer relatively direct storytelling at their midpoints and endpoints. Meaning that the first impression most players get is almost fully devoid of details on this intriguing world outside of the aforementioned rock regurgitation fest most players will never actually go through with, rendering the first playthrough more of an extended tutorial about discovering how the game works, and how to survive.

I've joked a lot at the game's expense thus far, but I truly do love Rain World. The thing is, it really is a game driven by discovery. Sure, it's frustrating to not understand much of anything at first, but the feeling this game provides of eking out an understanding of a brutal, cryptic world is unique and potent. For that reason, I don't want to spoil any specifics, so just trust me when I say that you should at least give this game a few hours if it looks interesting to you.

DISCLAIMER: Even though I'm giving a thumbs up I am not recommending this game for everyone! This game WILL be frustrating for new players and there are going to be moments where you feel you need to step away.

Do you think games are getting stale, old or boring? does it feel like you're repeating the same game over and over? If you answered yes then you're probably itching for a new experience, right? Well guess what, you just found one of the most unique games I've ever played and probably ever will play! Rain World is a game about adapting to an unforgiving, harsh ecosystem and overcoming tremendous odds as a small inexperienced creature.

You may have been told to be especially careful of spoilers and if you're curious why, let me tell you. If you see something new it's never obvious what anything is gonna do, which can change how you interact and learn about that element which can have MAJOR effects later on. an example would be my interactions with a large number of pretty huge beasts blocking where I needed to go, which I assumed were dangerous during my first few encounters with them. My fear of them had me backtrack to try and find another way through which took actual hours.

There are also many, MANY complexities when it comes to how things in the world interact with YOU. There is a particular system in Rain World that will decide whether you will delve into an nigh unwinnable war and become a wandering badass, or end up with all the riches in the world. Even when things are decided by RNG though, you can always gain back control. Even when you have no food on an empty stomache and are surrounded with the deadliest creatures this game has to offer, you can still make a come back. I did in the very worst of circumstances.

Ultimately, it's a very challenging and often frustrating title, with the freshest elements a game can have in the modern day. I would recommend it for those bored with games or craving a new experience, but warn those who aren't as patient to be warry.",1691073380,1691073380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like everyone else I bought Rain World, was confused on what to do, was wondering why this funny white cat isn't properly moving the way I want it to, and got really lost on what my objective was. Then I quit the game and realized I couldn't refund the game because I've already played it for more then 2 hours. So then it sat in my steam library taunting me everyday when I saw it. After many months of Rain World collecting dust in my library I decided to sit down and actually try and finish the game, just so I didn't feel cursed by it anymore. The game took a while to click with me, but when it did it clicked. I was soon in love with this funny slimy creature, the movement, and the amazing art and backdrops. But the one thing that always made me wanna play the game more was the music and the mastering of the movement, [spoiler]there is a 87 page google document with the most complex things imaginable.[/spoiler] You can notice when you are learning how to control the slugcat and master the combat. Soon after the lizards don't become a fearful thing you are scared to get close to, they instead become a creature that is insanely fun to engage with. Scavengers become something you always wanna fight with instead of trying to become Chieftain. The music always slaps no matter what, from the calming shoreline, to the aggressive dynamic threat music when you are fighting for survival. All the music feels like a reward, a accomplishment that you over came to listen to and relax. I don't really wanna go into story details because that will ruin the experience of accomplishing the goals in the game, but I wanna tell you to keep playing and don't give up because the game doesn't tell you anything. Rain World is probably my favorite game ever made, because the game feels like its own ecosystem that continues even when you are not even playing. Rain World is a amazing little indie game, and I recommend if you purchase it you also get Downpour.

Let's start with the good: the enviroments are beautiful, and they're a very good representation of what pixel art can do when it's done right. Sound design is great, music too - though maybe less so, as sometimes it feels too intrusive. If the intention was to imitate minecraft's music system, it didn't land quite well. 

You have a lot of freedom to explore the world, to the point where you can visit endgame location before the ""intended"" next one, which I did. This caused me a great deal of confusion, as in not understanding why the game is smashing my head with a brick. Luckily, community was quite eager to point out that it was a common case of ""skill issue"", and eventually I managed to find the ""intended"" path by going to the left instead of right.

The physics based movement system feels great to play with, but it does get tiring after some time. Slugcat deciding to explore vents and shafts with their behind first seems amusing, but it does lead to some stress when encountering the enemies that decide not to do the same.

Speaking of the enemies, their AI tends to be very broken, but Rain Deer is the biggest offender there - one of the only creatures I actually know the name of, because I had to look up their extremely wonky behavior, to ensure that's somehow not an issue only for me. How delightful.

Lastly, audio has the nasty habit of ""deep-frying"" itself sometimes, requiring relaunch - sounds funny, until you experience it mid-cycle and have to either risk ear damage, play without an important source of information, or lose progress.

Not that it matters, as you'll lose progress either way, with game randomly deciding to eat parts of your savedata from most recent session. This is a great deal to me, especially considering how difficult and borderline trial-and-error it gets in some areas. I want to play it more, but as it stands it's sadly not possible, with it being a pretty common occurence.

Overall, I can definitely say that this is a very one-of-a-kind experience. With how unusual it is, it's likely you might be suprised how much you'll like it. I can't recommend it however, for reasons mentioned above. Developers deciding to release a DLC instead of improving the game has only ensured me this won't change.",1690674572,1690997838,False,2,0,0.482965916395187378,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Uses procedural generated movement to create both very funny moments, and when a lizard isn't spinning in circles for 5 minutes, makes for a very realistic movement system.
-A super diverse ecosystem, where everything feels real. A basic example of this is Batfiles to Slugs, Slugs to Lizards, Lizards to Vultures. But, depending on where you look, or what animal you are stuffing into the ecosystem, it all fits in.
-The animals think like real animals. Take Scavengers, who have complex emotions, signals, and even a loyalty system that, unless you don't pay attention, really make for a fun experience.
-There's always some level of stress in the form of the deadly rain showers, but it's that fun stress where you're planning ahead. It forces you to think.
-The pixel-like in-game graphics, combined with the vibrant art style of cut scenes creates a immersive experience you just aren't going to get in other games like this.
-The story is complicated, but not so complicated you're going to be smashing your head on your desk, which is a breather compared to most story-driven games (although I wouldn't exactly classify Rainworld as one).
-There's a DLC that gives you literally a game's worth of new content; new Skugs with different attributes, food requirements, stories, timelines, endings, and regions. It also expands upon the story of this dystopian world. If you like the stock game, definitely check out the DLC. (it's named ""Downpour"", for those of you who are interested.)

Cons:
-The procedural generation movement system can end up being terrible sometimes. Rain deer are an obvious example of this goofy jank, which really sucks as they're required to cross a certain biome.
-You're going to die a lot. This isn't really a problem when you're skilled, or are completely fine with trial and error systems, but if you're the perfectionist kind who will smash in your monitor when you die twice in a row, stay away.
-There's a very high skill ceiling. As mentioned in the last con, dying isn't exactly a problem once you're a skilled player, but it takes a LONG time to become said ""skiled player.""
-The game's pretty long. Between the deaths, story, skill ceilings, and creature spawns, most first playthroughs are lengthy. I haven't beat the game yet, but I haven't even got to the first major plot point in 3 hours, and there's still 2 more with like, 5 biomes between them each. Told you it was lengthy.

So, overall, if you're just a casual gamer, should you buy this? Yes! It's an awesome indie game that needs more attention despite how much it already has. However, maybe stray away from it if you are more of a perfectionist gamer.",1690917656,1690917656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The procedural animation used for the creatures and the detailed backgrounds go together really well. Another thing Rainworld does really well is exploration and difficulty. There’s no handholding in Rainworld, and I think that’s a refreshing take on the modern consumer-friendly game formula. Of course, making things really hard had its downsides, hence the not overwhelmingly positive reviews. Anyways, you should try it!!! Get it when it’s on sale or something.

I purchased this game after hearing about how difficult it was. I love difficult, challenging games, and most of the negative reviews here are complaints about the difficulty. There's more to it though. The game isn't difficult just because it's challenging; the difficulty mainly comes from bad gameplay design. Two specific examples -

Many portions of the map expand across multiple screens, but you can't see the other side until your character actually moves there. There's no scrolling or preview before your character moves to the next section, it's just an abrupt transition from one area to the next. This means there are no shortage of times where you move to the other side of the map and are instantly consumed by an enemy that you couldn't see previously. This is a terrible design that has been fixed in games like this long ago by just showing a small preview of the other side as your character approaches. It's incredible that the devs couldn't think of doing anything similar in a game where dying literally sets your progress back.

The other aspect I want point out is the ""karma"" and ""karmic gates"" system (what does ""karma"" have to do with being eaten by a lizard? The name alone makes no sense). You have to have a successful cycle in order to gain ""karma"" points, which are required for progression.... Why? What purpose does this serve? It wouldn't be too much of an issue if it weren't for the issue described above, and for the simple fact that there are MANY instances where your success is entirely reliant on the RNG enemy placement. There are no shortage of situations where you simply CANNOT escape death. A game containing both of these elements together makes no sense, and again, is just terrible game design.

I saw a comment about how the main developer was ""surprised"" by the mostly negative reviews on this.... Really? I can't fathom how detached from reality someone would have to be to not think that this niche-game is going to be praised by the world, even without the glaringly bad design decisions listed above. Such a shame as it clearly had so much promise.",1690824192,1690824192,False,3,1,0.458392113447189331,0,True,False,False

I really wanted to enjoy this, but after around 8 hours of banging my head into a wall only to be met with sheer disappointment at my destination, I relented, and decided to move on the the next game on my steam library.

I never though I that I would say these words, as someone that is generally against these two things, but I feel like I would have enjoyed this game significantly more if you were told explicitly where to go,or there was fast travel.  I spent my 8 hours of playtime trudging my way to the east side of the map, because I thought that was where I was supposed to go, and once I got there, I was met with an npc that I had no idea what to do with, and the prospect that if I wanted to go further in this game I would have to go all the way back through what I just did.

Part of my issue is that everything in this game is slow.  Movement is slow, climbing is slow, eating is slow, waiting for enemies to move is slow, regaining your karma is slow.  As an art piece and a novel concept, its an incredible experience for the first few hours.  But once you contend with the prospect of actually progressing, it becomes much more of a drag.

TLDR:
This game is beautiful and the atmosphere and combat is one of the coolest ideas I've ever experienced in a game; but once you contend with the the idea of slowly backtracking through punishingly difficult areas towards a destination that is either unfulfilling or the wrong destination entirely, it becomes way less fun as a video game.",1690767813,1690767813,False,11,1,0.541117966175079346,4,True,False,False

Pluses:
+ Physics - The game feels very smooth in its animations and movements. Looks and feels uniquely nice
+ AI (artificial intelligence) is great! - probably the best and most interesting AI I have ever seen in real-time games. Every enemy has its own specific AI (and abilities, that this AI manages). They interact with their environment and other creatures, they travel around the map just as you do, some even can be befriended. Even observing other creatures is often fun. Really cool!
+ Very atmospheric - both visuals and sounds work for creating a strong sense of a natural atmosphere, even despite the game being a 2d pixel art
+ Realistic wild nature simulation - all higher points work for this specific feeling of a realistic, gloomy wild world, where you have to be really careful in order to survive.

± Story - there are some world descriptions here and there, and there are some plot points, but mostly there is no story
± Difficult - the game is really difficult (and it rises as you get to later locations), and mistakes can be brutal. Often (though not always) you will die in a single hit. Get ready to retry from last checkpoint a lot. This is the main gameplay feature of the game, it wanted to be difficult, so this means the game is not for everyone and requires patience.
± May feel repetitive, due to its high difficulty. It's a minus because it gets boring - but it's also a plus because you can just close the game and continue it later))

- Advanced controls are hard - I couldn't stably repeat some tricks written in the wiki while playing on my controller joystick outside of danger (and practically never could do it when chased). On monk (easiest) difficulty It's not too crucial, but on hunter (the hardest one) you will definitely appreciate using some advanced movements for hunting. Not cool (though I might need to check mods for this).

All in all: feels like a Hollow knight + Don't starve mashed together with amazing physics and AI. Difficult, very atmospheric adventure game, that feels like a sandbox at times. Sometimes it feels really pleasant just to move slowly and observe (or tame) other creatures. It's hard to sit in this game for too long in a single go, but that is probably a good point)

The games pixelated post-apocalyptic, damp, overgrown setting is somehow both bleak and wondrous with a subtle electronic score that serves as a reminder that predators lurk around each corner.

This game is a simulated ecosystem where you have both the prey you hunt to survive and the predators trying to hunt you. The world learns from your actions and responds to how you interact with it. The challenge then is to explore, eat, and find safe shelter from the routine giga storm that will kill you if you remain exposed when it shows up - a genuinely tense experience as the rumbling begins and water starts consuming the world.

The gameplay however is stiff and clunky. Movement is key to survival as predators pursue you but aside from the long jump the rest of the game's many movement options are hidden and don't execute smoothly. Grabbing while falling, climbing vertical bars, wall jumps tied to an invisible stamina bar, and crawling up sheer edges are all unintuitive and frustrating to execute consistently, especially when it counts.

It takes trial and error to learn how the ecosystem works but that isn't enough. There's a knowledge gate very early on that you aren't taught how to pass. After 3 years I looked at a guide only to discover I was unknowingly trapped in the earliest areas because it doesn't tell you that a necessary interaction is even possible to perform. I thought the game was enigmatic, turns out it's just obtuse for no perceptible reason.

It's an impressively complex game set in an charming world that I still want to delve into deeper, but the dedication to hiding key info from the player makes it an intentionally impenetrable experience that disappointed me. High points for creativity, anxiety inducing gameplay, and rich atmosphere, but points off for going out of its way to impede progress.

I was on a new year's sleepover so i had to tame my monstrous hunger to buy it by re watching CURIOUS ARCHIVE's video over and over as well as looking for any other decent you tubers and that's how i found both the wiki and where to get the game: steam. Click on my account and you'll see i have done steam reviews before and i knew i could buy the game with my Christmas money!

And then i got the game...

At first i wasn't sure how i felt; this game is a very weird one to play, and at times frustrating! yet i couldn't help but love how the creature design, karma system, combat and PROCEDURALLY GENERATED ANIMATION BRO, made this game so immersive. And by the time i got mover my essential difficulties i soon knew what i was doing and began to truly enjoy myself.

So what are my thoughts after buying downpour (haven't finished it yet) and having completed a survivor run?

Well...

It was a great experience and although sometimes i cried, sometimes i (internally) sreamed in frustration! but there are so many amazing interactions, satisfying moments, awesome discoveries (AND THE ANIMATION). You'll find yourself in a dynamic ecosystem the is being simulated all around you (,yes the game simulates stuff even a long way away from you meaning you may bump into fights, hunts and creatures literally anywhere at any time) Learn to move and fight your way through one of the greatest games of all time! Tell me if you want to hear more from this review BTW!

P.S. I love lizards! they are so cool!

I'd consider this a Metroidvania - despite the very minimal hand-holding from the developers, it's impossible to navigate the world without running familiar paths that cross over themselves. While you don't often gain new abilities or powerups to move forward, you DO become more familiar with the limits of your slugcat and just how much you can push them.

Every time I open up this game I learn something new about it. It's effin' fantastic. My understanding of the game and knowledge of its mechanics continues to build on itself without being overwhelming or needlessly overcomplicated; you learn to BE the slugcat, not just move it around on-screen. sound design is impeccable. ost is atmospheric, gameplay-dynamic and immersive. I can recognize what creatures are around me just by listening. (I've played with and without sound, and while you don't NEED audio to survive, it's strongly recommended. Don't handicap your scug if you don't have to <3) The controls have a bit of a learning curve to them, but it's like learning to ride a bike; the more you move around, the easier and more natural it becomes, and the more sick tricks you can pull off.

I bought the game + DLC while it was on sale, but I did NOT hesitate to drop the full $40 a few days later to get it for a friend. Rain World has a complexity and level of detail and care poured into it that continues to amaze me and inspires ideas for games of my own. Never would've even considered rigged pixel animation as a viable option before playing this.

I still don't know why I'm here or if I'm going in the right direction but at least my only guide has abandoned me. Now I'm glowing, confused, and can suddenly see ghost worms all going in the same direction. Following these ghost worms, I come to a blackened and ruined area devoid of life besides some bioluminescent critters that scamper around. The ghost worms are no help now so I attempt to explore on my own. After a very frustrating while I eventually find my way to a place I'd been months ago, absolutely killing me inside.

Before I begin, let it be known that this game has a large cult following, and rightfully so. As such, any criticisms of the game are immediately attacked. I always leave comments on in my reviews; if you see someone dismissing my points without a good counter, or otherwise just being a fanboy, simply discredit them and move on. Not worth arguing with the die-hards of any subject.

Pros:
- Art style and atmosphere in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Each area is wholly unique, filled with wholly unique flora and fauna, and is NEVER boring. Just the desire to see what the next area looks like and what life it is home to forces me to march onward.
- Enemy variety is very high and literally every single creature is awesome. Even the annoying creatures that will have you cursing at the screen are a treat to look at and just as cool to try and avoid. Wildlife AI is stupid good in this game, it's honestly hard to describe how ""real"" their behaviors feel.
- Very demanding game in terms of skill required. (more on this later in the cons). In terms of pure gameplay, the game is usually very fair but asks a ton of attention from the player to make precise jumps, smart maneuvers, etc.
- The sense of exploration is generally fantastic, though I'll touch on this in the cons.
Overall, the Pros are: this is a visual treat to look at (the animations are procedurally generated and makes everything look amazing!), feels like you're traversing a living, breathing alien world in a way I've never seen before.

Neutral:
- Story is basically non-existent. Die-hards will tell you it's much deeper than it is. There's effectively no exposition, simply a few still-images that serve as cutscenes and show you a handful of emotions. The rest is lore you'd REALLY have to dig for to make any sense of. 
- Controls and movements for your character are surprisingly deep, but the game does not do practically anything to teach you how to do them. I've seen die-hards say that it's intentional and that ""part of the game is discovering the moveset"". That's dumb. fighting games have move lists so you KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. The game has a seriously cool amount of movement options that require precise timings or inputs and it explain nothing but how to jump and climb. People have made (literally) 20 page documents covering the depth of the movement system in this game; I could have used a few more tutorials on essential movement mechanics. People forget that this is a video game. I want to play it. Teach me how to play it. Teach me the rules of the game world, teach me how to maneuver, THEN you can let me figure out the mysteries of the world using those tools. 
- The game is simply too open ended. You will find countless threads on Steam and Reddit asking ""Where do I go?"", and it's not because everyone is dumb (though people are dumb, I know lol). The game is (barring Karma requirements) totally open. There is a little helper that shows some pictograms once in a while to help guide you through the first ""act"" of the game, but after that, you're on your own almost exclusively for the second act. There's a reason metroidvania games give you a general direction of where to go but don't show you how to get there. That's all you need to give the players some direction while still letting them explore the world. This game could have used that, just a bit bigger nudge, to get players going East instead of West after act 1, for example.


Cons:
I need to preface this by saying to the die-hard following: I agree that this game has a lot of amazing parts to it. Try to quell your insatiable desire to roast me alive for these criticisms.

- Outside of the normal controls and gameplay of platforming and combat, there are 3 main game mechanics that make up the gameplay loop; Rain, Karma, and Gates. None of these three mechanics are implemented well AT ALL.
- Rain is effectively a timer. You have a timer to go from one checkpoint to another, and you have to have collected enough food along the way to your next checkpoint to be able to ""hibernate"", which lets you save your game at that checkpoint. If the timer runs out and it starts to rain, you die. 
These timers, in some areas, are absolutely brutal as it requires practically zero mistakes on your way to the next checkpoint. This game, unlike most games, doesn't have consistent enemy spawns; the enemies kind of roam the map in a living eco-system. This by itself is totally awesome! However, it makes for a frustrating time when paired with a timer that kills you. Imagine all the long boss runs in the original Dark Souls, except you're on a timer that kills you if it runs out and the enemies are spawned almost randomly, making some of them directly block your path to the next boss/bonfire/etc. Eventually, that timer starts to annoy you.
- To make things worse, the Karma/Gate system comes into play. When you start the game, you have a total of 5 Karma points. Every time you die, you lose 1 point. Every time you hibernate at a checkpoint with enough food in your belly, you gain 1 point. Simple enough.
Karma points are like ""skill"" checks that allow you to pass through Gates (Gates being large doors that block off each zone from one another). Lets say you reach a Gate in a zone you've already explored and you're ready to move on to the next zone. If the gate requires 4 Karma, it will not open unless you have 4 Karma out of 5. 
The problem lies within the tedium of all 3 of these systems put together. It goes something like this:
- You die a LOT in this game because it is a very challenging game to learn and an even harder one to master. You inevitably will end up with 1-2 Karma from dying so often.
- You will finally make some progress and find the Gate to the next area, only to find that it requires a higher Karma count than you currently have. So, you head back to find food and rest at the same checkpoint form before so you can gain a Karma point.
- You are forced to sleep/hunt for food/repeat multiple times to build up the Karma needed to progress the game. Mind you, grabbing berries and bats is not hard, it is simply tedious after a while. It does not increase the challenge, just as farming for Blood Vials in Bloodborne didn't increase the challenge there.
- When you have enough Karma to open the gate, you must make it to the gate without dying, while collecting food to prepare yourself for the next checkpoint, and make it far enough in the next area to find the next checkpoint without dying. If you die before you find the next checkpoint, the gate will close, and you must repeat the hunt/sleep/repeat cycle again because when you died, your karma fell below the threshold.
- All the while you're repeating this same hunt/sleep/run to the gate/try to find next checkpoint cycle...you're on a timer. The clock is ticking and if it starts to rain, you're dead. Dead = hunt, sleep, hunt, run to gate, try to find checkpoint again.

It is beyond tedious. 

Outside of the die-hard fans, the general public agrees with me on all of these points, which is why in the ""Remix"" settings they added to the game, they allow you to turn off all 3 of those mechanics. It even warns you that it's ""not the intended way to play"" and all that, yet I find myself having a great time since I turned that crap off. The game is still immensely hard without a constant death timer and the tedium of grinding for Karma. 

I find myself day dreaming about playing this game because when it's good, it's SOOOO good, but I probably would have stopped playing had those core mechanics not been turned off. I wish developers would learn that tedium is NOT difficulty.
The rest of the game though is amazing and offers an incredible challenge, even with the rain timer and karma gates turned off.",1690422854,1690422854,True,2,0,0.525209128856658936,0,True,False,False

I love the feeling of this not being just a game that the main character rules, but instead an ecosystem that you're apart of. I have not finished it because it can be quite tough but, personally, I find that battle very rewarding and it makes me enjoy the game even more. Also, the music this game carries is incredible and every time I get to a new environment, it feels like the end of a huge journey. The scenery and design of this game is very gorgeous and I love the personality creatures can have. I'm definitely buying the soundtrack and have already bought the DLC because I know I'll love it.

However, as I said before, this game can be and will be challenging. Especially in the harder stages(?). The amount of times I've died has left me very frustrated but I've learnt that it's more part of the process rather than failing. You learn something new every death, you know? Sometimes luck is just not on your side and you have to give up, it happens. As for the price, I personally think it fits the game perfectly as you can get a LOT of hours and content out of this game but obviously it's a lot and I know not everyone is willing to waste that much on one game.

On a serious note though, this game is very unfair. You will die by seemingly random chance. Predators might just block your path. The game is bullshit, it's unfair, and difficult, but that's how nature simply is. You adapt, survive, and learn. Give this game a shot, try it blind, try to stick with it, if you don't like it, if you hate dying over and over due to complete bullshit, put it down, it's probably not for you. But if it clicks, if you push through the bullshit, if you get good, if you learn your place in this ecosystem, this game will be one of your favorite games of all time. You will understand all the creature's behavior, you will learn how to deal with each creature, you will learn the map, your place in the ecosystem, and it might be one of your favorite games of all time.",1690349233,1690349757,True,63,1,0.816932797431945801,0,True,False,False

Despite brief tutorial and cruel world,It has an amazing mechanic running the world.

Damn it.After toss this game for a period I finally DARE to play this.Though I Even completed Iron Soul mode from Hollow Knight,This game is still A PAIN IN THE ASS for me.So much to learn.So diverse the worlds present.And so ferocious and HARD enemies you are 'bout to encounter.With   ultimate pain and time you pay for it, this game simply uses peril and treasure moments reward you.

In a word ,This game is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly hard and more tenacious you are you will be rewarded more.

After beating five pebbles My hobby in the game is to watch that blue d1ckhead abomination consuming lizards and vultures in sandbox mode.

You'll either treat this game as a retarded abomination after die few death before refund time limit and never managed to leave even the first area,or You will be in deep love with this world as you move to the remote area where kick-ass things actually holds.

给明月送了DNA（去它的FP），重新走了朝圣路线。

瞎几把想的部分：
这个游戏每一次回味的过程中，我越发的喜爱它。
一般来说，游戏开发者需要在艺术性、真实性和可玩性上权衡。有时候我会想他们是怎么想的：
”我有一个超级牛逼的故事和一个完美的世界观设定；我们拥有最精美的像素艺术和最流畅的动作引擎（当然，有时候bug挺多的）；我们构建了一个动态的、危险的世界；我们允许玩家自己选择行进方向；我们设置了数量比教程提到的还要多10倍的小动作操作。“
“玩家测试的反馈如何？”
“我觉得挺好的。”
“于是，这款有着很少的新手教程，残忍的难度，潜在的死档可能性的游戏发售了”

评测出来后
“有很多人不喜欢它”
“哦？去它的，我相信玩下去的人不会畏惧我们设立的层层困难，并学会这个世界运作的机制，了解这个世界的历史。我们会为有技巧、毅力探索这个世界的玩家准备一份独一无二的礼物。”
“那么玩不下去的呢？”
“没关系，选择玩什么是他们的权利，发表好评差评也是他们的权利。我们随时欢迎他们回来，但是我们不会有任何妥协（Monk模式点了个赞，但也简单不到哪去），因为这是我们创造的世界。”
