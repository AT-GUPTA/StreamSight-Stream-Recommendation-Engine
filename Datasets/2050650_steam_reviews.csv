This has got to be one of the best remakes and games of the decade, and it absolutely met my expectations and was very fun. The original is still good, but they can co-exist. Since the original was where I got my name, I HAD to get it.

The good:

- You can move while aiming now.
- An exciting new parry mechanic that greatly overhauls the knife.
- Less QTEs.
- Lots of new content, such as bounties to get better gear or kill the time.
- Ranking system, differences in hardcore to make you get the game or replay it.
- Ashley is a lot more likable now. She actually HELPS you a few times, has a more likable personality and actually dresses like someone's who's a public figure or in cold weather.
- Luis is playable in the mercenaries and has a bigger role in the story!
- Krauser is no longer an ass pull and is explained in the intro.
- A button to auto sort inventory and autosaves.
- Probably the best mercenaries mode thus far.
- Ada has an expanded moveset in both separate ways and the mercenaries.
- More dialogue and all characters are even better.
- The game now has correct spanish, no longer using random latin american words or referring to Ada as a male (Spanish is a gendered language, unlike english).

[quote=Allie]
In 2022, Capcom revealed that they were going to release a Remake of RE4, news that left many people with a bittersweet taste (including me) and with a lot of lack of confidence due to the ""perfection"", the large number of ports it had and overvaluation of the original work from 2005 which made most of the fans think it was going to be a failure until one night on March 23, 2023 where CAPCOM released one of the most anticipated Remakes of this decade to the public, I had planned to do my analysis to this installment a week after playing it, but I decided not to do, to be able to wait for all its complete content to arrive and to be able to squeeze all this game, I haven't left it for a minute so much so I played all its ports (Including VR) and I dared to play the original version on my old Gamecube. Today, February 2024, almost a year after the game came out and with all its content already published and played, I would like to say my analysis of this great work after having played all its content.[/quote]


[h3]Entrance.[/h3]
I would like to start by saying that this time I will not classify it by categories because almost everyone already knows how perfect this Remake is, but.... even though it is a Remake, it has a very unique and quite marked identity, giving an aesthetic faithful to its old but polished and with new things mentioning aspects such as:

1. The visual improvement through color palettes (Looking much more natural, unlike the 2005 version that made it look so artificial and in a copy-paste of recycled textures).

2. Characters with a fairly rich and complex narrative that I had never seen in a Resident Evil (Not even in its previous Remakes) mentioning points such as:

[list]
[*]An Ashley who tries to find a way to improve herself.
[*]A Leon who suffers from PTSD, Depression, Hero Syndrome and with resentment for not having been what he wanted in [*]his life.
[*]A Luis who tries to find the path to redemption after everything he has committed.
[*]A Krauser hungry for power, anger, depression, envy and resentment towards Leon that led him down a bad path.
[*]A Ramon with a lot of depth and not a joke like in the original version, being a real villain.
[/list]

3. Follow the influence of RE2 Remake by rebooting its first works in a narrative and visual aspect, giving us a much more ""realistic"" and natural game, eliminating those that did not make sense, giving points such as:

[list]
[*]The part where you could choose if you could go with the Bella sisters or the Giants.
[*]The scene where you run away from the statue of Ramon Salazar.
[*]The lava scene.
[*]Bitorez Mendez's eye as a key.
[*]Cable cars in perfect working order and scanning doors in a rural town.
[*]The door of Bitorez's house with a digital puzzle and a meaningless scenario.
[/list]

4. Details that make this game look quite realistic (Not mention its excellent graphics engine).

[list]
[*]Really make a rural town in Spain giving the enemies a Castilian accent and not a mixed Hispanicamerican accent that was seen in the original version, the environment that faithfully complies with a Mediterranean biome, the texture of the Spanish pesetas that are the same to those in real life.
[*]Enemies that came in hordes and with improved AI where they usually plan ambushes, push themselves, dodging attacks, sudden movements, warning other enemies and can no longer be easily deceived by the player.
[*]Improved dismemberment (Although I can put as a negative point the lack of Gore and the lack of facial expressions when dying, which the RE2 Remake does have)

https://youtu.be/DOIoGiBYzWc?si=bFy-0QQTxjTZuOx1

[*]The resistance of edged weapons.
[*]Leon's expressions (Hurt, Tired, When he has stained clothes, etc.)
[*]An improved Hitbox, now any action the player does such as climbing a ladder, going through a door, passing through windows, hitting, etc., will not save them from any ranged blow or surprise attacks, giving us challenging gameplay.
[/list]


5. A much scarier atmosphere than its original version thanks to its graphics engine.

6. Quite polished, innovative and realistic but dynamic gameplay.

7. Open map system with more freedom.

8. A fairly faithful story but improved by making it more original.

[h3]Conclusion.[/h3]
In my personal opinion, Resident Evil 4 REMAKE is a game that not only surpassed its original version (and makes other examples of ""How to make Remakes""), it also changed the saga forever due to its rich narrative structure, its map system that makes this game quite open (I really feel the influence of Miyazaki's works on shortcuts), the secondary missions, the crafting system, a fairly unique gameplay, an OST that i personally far surpassed its original version, a technical section from another world and I would say quite advanced for this time, things that could influence the next future Remakes that CAPCOM will release; The only negative things I give to this game are its interface and poor optimization that it has on some PCs.

[i]Resident Evil 4 REMAKE became one of my favorite games in a short time and showed that works can improve things that are difficult to improve like masterpieces.....[/i]

This was a trip down the memory lane I desperately needed and wanted. It did all the right things RE2 remake did, and stomped RE3 remake (as expected).

The game looks amazing. The landscape, the surroundings, the details (such as valuables) - it's all perfectly fitted into a visual masterpiece.

The music and sound effects are on another level. Every time you end up in a tense situation, the music amplifies the emotions of panic and urgency, intensifying the overall authentic RE experience. Weapon sounds are spot on as well.

The story is legendary, and RE4 remake did it justice. I hate it when people remake the game and completely f up the story. It's simply not the case here. The recognizable story is there, and if you've played the original, you're sure to point a finger at a thing or two and go ""Hey, I remember that!""

Lastly, the shooting range mini games are sooooo good. I've spent literal hours trying to grind out the perfect result and get the charm I need. The charms actually have a huge impact on the gameplay, and the fact that there's a charm for movement speed buff related to the original game is an amazing detail.

The only thing I miss (not from the original game) are the puzzles. The RE2 remake nailed that, and I wanted more from the puzzle and backtracking aspect of RE4 remake. Don't get me wrong, there were puzzles in the game, but they were simply not on RE2 remake's level.

In addition, I'm so sad that there's virtually no replay value. If you play through the game carefully enough, find all the collectibles, and upgrade all the main weapons, there's not much left to do in new game + (except the RPG mayhem).

My overall impressions (RE4 + Separate Ways) equal to 9.6/10. Definitely do recommend to both those who have played the original game and those who are looking to fall in love with this franchise!",1708448956,1708448956,True,2,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The Resident Evil 4 remaster on PC is a resounding success, delivering an exceptional blend of nostalgia and contemporary gaming advancements. This remaster not only revitalizes one of the most beloved entries in the Resident Evil franchise but also sets a new benchmark for how to update a classic game for modern audiences, much like the Dead Space remake.

The graphical overhaul is nothing short of remarkable. The developers have meticulously updated textures, character models, and environments, making the game look stunning on modern PC hardware. Every location from the eerie village to the ominous castle has been reimagined with an incredible level of detail, bringing the world of Resident Evil 4 to life like never before. The lighting effects, in particular, add a new layer of atmosphere and tension, enhancing the game's iconic horror elements.

The remaster also boasts updated audio that significantly improves the immersion. The soundscape has been carefully crafted to enhance the sense of dread and suspense, with every gunshot, footstep, and growl of the enemies feeling more impactful. The voice acting and sound effects have been polished, ensuring that the audio quality matches the visual fidelity.

One of the most commendable aspects of the Resident Evil 4 remaster is how it respects the original gameplay while implementing subtle improvements that modernize the experience. The controls have been refined, offering a smoother and more intuitive gameplay experience that aligns with contemporary standards without compromising the game's original charm. The inventory system and UI have also received updates, making them more user-friendly while retaining the essence of the original design.

PC gamers, in particular, will appreciate the extensive customization options available. The game supports a wide range of resolutions, has an uncapped frame rate, and offers detailed graphical settings that allow players to tailor the experience to their preferences and hardware capabilities. These features ensure that the game not only looks and runs beautifully on a variety of systems but also remains accessible to a broad audience.

Meanwhile, Ada Wong has to perform her own secret mission, which is playable in the Separate Ways DLC.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Fight against a wide variety of enemies including cultists armed with axe, crossbow, chainsaw or shield, plaga parasites which erupt from cultists’ heads on death, mutant dogs, spiders, giant flying insects, living suits of armour, and huge bosses.

•	Wield several different weapons including knife, pistol, shotgun, SMG, sniper rifle, magnum, bolt thrower, and frag/flash grenades.

•	Find hidden treasures, sell them to the merchant, and buy upgrades to weapon damage, clip size, fire rate and reload speed.

•	There are some optional side quests which will reward you with extra treasures to trade with the merchant for special items, but they feel repetitive and out of place. (Mostly shoot some blue medals hanging in the environment, or kill some rats).

•	RE4 feels more like an action game instead of survival horror. Whilst you do have to manage limited ammunition, healing items, and inventory space, and your movement speed is quite slow, you’ll regularly have to fight against large groups of 15-20 enemies, usually in small rooms or areas with no way to retreat to a better tactical position. These sections don’t really feel like Resident Evil to me. (Although I suppose this is probably what the remakes of RE5 and 6 will be like too).

•	The most frustrating sections of gameplay also have the added complication of needing to protect Ashley, whose AI is really dumb. Absolutely no sense of self preservation whatsoever. Whilst I’m busy getting swarmed by cultists, Ashley will always get grabbed by the one guy who aggros on her, and even after I put myself at risk to shoot that guy, Ashley will just stay crouched on the ground waiting to get grabbed again. And of course, [spoiler]even though she gets kidnapped about five times during cutscenes and the story continues,[/spoiler] if she gets kidnapped during gameplay, its an instant game over.

•	Thankfully, the gameplay during Ada’s DLC campaign is closer to my preferred survival horror experience, so at least my playthrough finished on a more positive note.

•	The other significant addition for Ada is a grappling hook which she can use to reach some high ledges, allowing you to quickly evade some enemies. You can also pull yourself closer to stunned enemies to perform a melee attack, and the merchant sells a charm which allows the grapple to disarm shield wielding cultists.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	I didn’t like the original version of the story because there were far too many cringey lines of dialogue, and its comedic tone was totally out of place in a horror game. This reworked story’s darker and more serious tone is a massive improvement.

•	There are several interesting characters including Leon and Ada, Luis, the villains seem to have more depth and backstory, and even Ashley, despite my frustrations with her during gameplay, I did like her personality and interactions with Leon in cutscenes.

•	Voice acting is mostly good.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	At 24 hours for the main story, plus 7 hours for Separate Ways, RE4 is one of the longest Resident Evil games.

•	This is a rare 2023 release which has flawless technical performance. I had no problems with crashes, bugs or framerate.

•	Graphics are obviously a big improvement over the original version.

•	Controls are mostly rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard. My only complaint is the mouse scroll wheel only goes through 4 of the 8 weapon slots, which seem to be designed with a gamepad in mind.

•	I wish I could manually control when to use the flashlight instead of the game deciding when Leon would use it (which is less often than I would like).

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

While this remake of Resident Evil 4 is definitely better than the original version, I’d still rank it lower than several other games in the franchise because of its focus on action instead of survival horror. I was going to say wait for a sale but I noticed Capcom just reduced the default price anyway to an amount I’d consider good value.",1708386176,1708386201,True,17,0,0.657415211200714111,0,True,False,False

I played the shit out of the original RE4 and had it on both GameCube and PC. I've beaten it numerous times and almost had 5 stars in every Mercenaries level. When I fired up the game for the first time, it advised me if I played the 2005 release, then pick hardcore.

Do not pick hardcore.

Hardcore restricts your resources pretty hard. The village was a stiff challenge but manageable. By the time I got to the castle, I was getting completely depleted of ammo in every room that had enemies. I don't know what my actual accuracy stat was, but I know I wasn't missing THAT many shots. There are a lot of significant changes to the gameplay (none of which I'd consider bad), so there's a big learning curve. In fact, someone who's used to how the original works may actually find their habits are working against them in this game. Finding treasures wasn't a nice bonus--it was absolutely necessary because without upgrading my weapons very carefully and buying new weapons, I shudder to think how much harder it would've been.

Now is hardcore _unfair_? Hmm, I suppose not. But what it did was push me to my absolute limit and with some games when you up the difficulty enough, you start needing to play the meta game in order to progress. I found myself doing things like manipulating the distance at which enemies would aggro me, spending crafting resources in such a way that I could control what items would drop from a crate/vase/whatever. So yeah, I started to git gud, but I didn't like the experience it was giving me. I fired up a brand new game, which is fine because this maintains everything that made the original fun and THEN some, set it to the standard difficulty, and now I'm enjoying myself.

Is it too easy? Maybe. I have more than enough bullets to get the job done, and the last time I checked I have an abundant supply of grenades, far more than I would get in the original. However, if I fool around too much, I die. I haven't looked up the specifics of how each difficulty works, so I don't know what kinds of things, if any, the game is doing to adjust the difficulty on the fly, but I'll tell you this: it's FUN. It feels like RE4 again. So I like that the option to play the hardcore mode is in the game, but even if you're pretty familiar with the original, I wouldn't recommend this difficulty the first time through. You need to get acquainted with how the remake plays, unless you like your level of challenge to be SADISTIC.

Anyway, the original is a classic, and the remake captures the essence. Leon's ""Where's everybody going? Bingo?"" remains intact, preserving one of gaming's greatest title cards. Changes have been made for the better, such as Ashely's previously awkward dialogue to something more fitting. Additionally, the remake clarifies that Ashley's actions, like running away from Leon in the castle, are due to the plagas, addressing the original's ambiguity.

A possible flaw in this game is as I'm exploring areas for goodies, I feel like I'm often running in circles and checking the map too much. That might be a me thing, but I'm not so sure I agree with some of the changes to the layout of this game. In the original, I thought the game flowed really smoothly and I didn't have to check the map but a couple times--throughout the entire game. I won't pass judgement on it yet, but I'm not sure if I'm completely onboard with needing to backtrack in order to unlock drawers and chests.

You're not really playing this game for the story, especially if you've already beaten the original Resident Evil 4. However, you are gonna wanna play this game for the improved combat and gameplay systems. The enemies are more aggressive in harder difficulties than they were in the original, and (much to the chargin of speedrunners everywhere), the AI is a unpredictable with the attacks the enemies use, which means optimizing routes is more difficult, so you are incentivized to kill enemies most of the time rather than just down them or try for a single headshot into a kick.

Enemies also don't stagger as consistently compared to the original game (leaning into the more unpredicatble aspect of this game), so you need to be damn well sure that you're pumping enough lead into your intended target for them to stagger so you can get that melee kick. For some this is a negative, but I personally like it, since single shot-stagger-melee tactics were pretty OP in the original game and allowed you to trivialize hordes of enemies.

Anyway, the game's fun, go get it.

I will still recommend this game to people. Everyone seems to love it. I'm the 'odd man out' here. Plus, as I said, it's a very good game. It's not BAD at all. It just wasn't grabbing me like other titles in the series - my favorite being the RE1 and RE2 remakes. Those are my favorites of the RE series. Despite all the acclaim this RE4 remake gets, it's actually my second least favorite of the modern RE games (from RE7 to now). My least favorite would be RE8. Then RE4 remake.

Different strokes for different folks. I prefer the slower-paced, pure survival-horror focus of RE1 and RE2. These more action-focused RE titles don't really do it for me personally.

Whilst I appreciate that, at the time of writing I only have 2.6 hours of game time, I'll say that I'm a little disappointed in how much the game is deviating from the original. I don't understand why they've chopped and changed things that weren't broken. For instance, why is it the knife now has a health bar? Why are enemies re-aliving themselves so early in the game? And why is the laser removed and replaced with crosshairs? Also subtle changes have been made to the map and storyline but for no discernible gain. 

Is the game still good, great even? Yes. I just don't understand what was wrong with a re-skin of the old classic. For someone who never played the original RE4, you'll be none the wiser and therefore won't care and will be able to take the game purely at face value.

Game runs fine at 100fps and suddenly the frame drops to 30. This happens in totally random areas and even in closed spaces like every 2 minutes. And in some parts happens massive stutterings just as random as the frame drop. I have never seem any game behave this bad and random like this, unplayable for me. I don't know if it's denuvo or just bad optimization, but I hope they patch this somehow, because for now it is just terrible, which is sad cause the game really seems to be pretty incredible. But I guess in the end I shouldn't be surprised, another classic and common case of horrible PC port alongside this cancer they call denuvo.

Edit: after almost an year playing this game I'm giving a thumbs up for it cause the game is actually amazing, almost perfect. It is everything you could expect from a RE4 remake.

-Combat gameplay improvement.
-Graphics (RE Engine it's just awesome).

As someone who has played the original I can say that both are really good. The remake really managed to make the game feel similar yet completely different. Also, I'm really glad Luis got more screen time, I love that guy! 

Moving on to separate ways, I went in blind for this one, other then the main game (I watched a play trough on YouTube). The DLC was more then I expected, it isn't just a little side story with fun game play like it was in the original, it really is its separate adventure. I'm amazed! Can't go into much detail 'cause that would spoil the game a bit, eh? But trust me, its awesome!

Last but not least, The mercenaries DLC is also really fun! Especially after finishing the game. Luis is a character now unlike the original which I LOVE! And you're less racing against the clock, since killing enemies now grants you extra time. Love the change, the fact that i can walk and aim at the same time is also really nice (not just for the mercenaries, but also for the main story), makes the gameplay much smoother.

RE4R is definitely well made and it removed one of the most annoying parts that I was worried I'd have to contend with. QTEs... But they're gone! Rejoice! On top of that, there are other changes like save points, autosave, enemy types, added weapons, and others. Almost all good for a modern game now. The only PROBLEM I had was the voice lines of the Trader. He is much more talkative now and that isn't really my favorite thing. Still, I won't knock the game for that.

Overall great, escorting Ashley is much better as you don't have to manage her health or share healing items like the original. Knife parry system allows high level players to use their skill to avoid damage. Also reduced quick time events are a bonus (no more in cutscenes too, which is great}, far less button mashing, only a timed evade to dodge some attacks that can't be parried and a little button mashing to break free if your knife is broken or are held from behind. Knife durability system is only an issue if a knife isn't upgraded, so conserve your knife at the beginning of the game if you can.

While Capcom might be such a company, Resident Evil 4 Remake is no such game.

The game is attractive for those who have played the old title while keeps a very good level of game experience for those new to the game. Action is fine, puzzles are not too dump, story is elaborated, the screaming high-pitch Ashley is not there anymore, dialogues are so much mature, Luis's presence makes more sense, and Ada actually helps to the story, not just popping on and off to play some sarcasm with Leon.

I was a little upset that some cool parts of games were removed, just to wait and buy the DLC, Separate Ways, to see that those parts were cleverly has been put to compliment the story and overall game experience. There are still some parts of the original game removed, but nothing so big that makes the remake any shorter than the original.

Don't let my playtime fool you. I have 160 hours of in-game time count because I am a seafarer and I was playing it offline mode on a ship. Yeah, the WiFi on ships blocks a lot of stuff including Steam. 

Let me put it this way. I am a die hard fan of Original RE4 and thought no other RE games, not even a Remake would top that game-play experience that gave me as a child. And I was right so far. I finished the game for more than 3 dozen times across all the platform I could play it on. Completed all achievements on steam, 5 stars on all stages of all characters in mercenaries and loved every bits of it.

Before I played the Remake, I swore to every ounce of my body that I would not even like the remake for anything less than that. I would not lie to myself or anybody to pretend liking it for the money it cost or whatever the reason I can think of. If I don't like it I'd just outright say that I do not like it at all. No excuses. And to my surprise, that was exactly what I got. This game is so well made and so fun, it exceeds the expectations exceptionally well.

I tried the Demo first and I can see it was well made but not very impressed.Especially the rag-doll movement of Leon is kinda off for me. But then I bought the full game and started playing for real. After a while, I get the hang of movement and it bother me less. And everything feels like a true survival horror in real time. Especially since now every door does not need a loading screen to open, making the whole area of the map one big playground for Leon. Short keys for weapons means no need to open my inventory every time I want to switch my weapons. The flow of the game-play is just flawless and it makes me adapt to the obstacles and find tactics in real time. The game-play experience is off the charts. As a guy who loves game-play experience over graphics and storytelling aspects of any game, this is truly marvelous. A perfect example of ""Took the best and made it better"".

Stunning graphics and excellent character designs. Very well made.

Sound effects are excellent. Background music could have been better though.

As of now I have finished the game, completed 100% of the achievements. I love Original RE4 to the bone and as much as it saddens me, I will admit it.

While the story does lose a little since they are trying to move away from the campyness of the original and trying to be a more serious game it's still the same exact story though i do think that the antagonists needed more moments of taunting the player like it was in the original game, also ramon should have kept his hat as he now just looks like your crazy grandmother with his hair. though the problems i do have are the weird hit boxes and accuracy such as in 1 moment i was shooting a regenerator with the sniper and since i needed to save the ammo i would reload my save anytime i missed and i would have a free shot at it since it's in a tube i'd line up and shoot it but like 40% of the time i'd still miss 1 parasite out of the 2 i had lined up and 20% i'd miss both with the rest hitting both despite being in the exact same spot, which is a common problem because i felt like many of my missed head shots should have hit them and in the final boss i had many times it would grab me despite me not being where it looks like it could grab me and this happened against many enemies that clearly missed me but suddenly either yank my character back or turn to be aligned with my character one instance warping to be in front of my character only to warp back to where it was when i brake out as if the gab spot is larger that the character's size. i also feel as though for the weapons that only get that upgrade like the red9 and it's stock should just combine and upgrade the weapon like it did in re2. i felt like the bolt launcher was a terrible weapon, i understand it's for stealth but i feel like it does way to little damage to be of use, would require too much pesetas to be made useful and most fight locations are designed to fight hordes anyway so it never felt like it held much use. i hate permanent missables i can at least understand when going from map to map such as village to castle, but most permanent missables you only realize after you've missed them and have to decide if loading and potentially going through a section again is worth it, worse if you missed it in the ashley section as that was absolutely awful, or hope you remember it on another play though and i'm not the type to play a game after i beat it unless i absolutely love it and it's short enough and to me while i like this game it's not one of those. i thought we fixed this in re3? why does the knife have durability again? it should never have durability and i hate that you have to do the same stupid thing as re 2 remake to get the knife with infinite durability, oh but i almost forgot you have to upgrade it to have that which you only get halfway though the game so to have the knife the game should have had at the beginning it requires 1 and a half full play thoughts and a ton of pesetas. as i said on my re3 remake review i would hope their next resident evil remakes would be code: veronica then 1 and 0 TOGETHER or at least 0 being dlc to 1 remake like 3 remake should have stayed for 2 remake before they think of going to 5 and maybe 6, i feel like they would do a 5 remake but i have my doubt of 6 and i feel like they'd rather make a new 6 instead of remaking the original.",1707867296,1707867296,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We're getting much bigger and much more boom boom in here. Like its predecessors, there are not really any games of this size and quality being released nowadays. In an industry of 40 hour games, the RE games are a necessary 5-10 hour adventure that demand to be played. 

I enjoyed this game a lot, as it reminded me of playing Gears games when I was younger. Though not as machismo, the action just chugs along in such a refined manner that you just can't wait to roundhouse the next zombie yelling Spanish at me. 

BUT. With the advancement in pure sadistic entertainment, gone is the intricate masterful level design of RE2. I may have enjoyed this game more, but it is a notably different experience from RE2 (as it was back in 2005?). If RE2 is art, RE4 is the bombastic b-movie, which is just as valuable. Fuck anyone who reads this and think I'm trying to put the action movie down. Still, I don't mind being a snobby prick by pushing up my glasses and saying: ""yes, you should probably play RE2 over RE4 if you had to choose one because RE2 is probably more significant to the gaming canon than RE4 remake is."" There. I said it. 

BUT (again). This is a great game, and one of the most fun I played in 2023. Don't miss out.

   Krauser fight is absolute bs. His head crushing attack, to dodge it you need to duck, which is simple enough if it was consistent. I'd duck just as I see him pull his shoulder back and he'd still grab my head, and the knife even when fully upgraded usually still ends up breaking in durability. 
   I get Krauser is supposed to be mutated BUT HOLY F*** EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL, YOU STAB HIM IN THE FACE A HANDFUL OF TIMES AND HE DROPS.
    It doesnt need to be 30+ stabs just to have him enter a phase where he slams the entire bottom of the arena, when he can already sometimes cut you down as you're climbing a ladder. You can also try to wait for him to jump up, but if you're too close, Leon's stagger animation takes as long as it does for Krauser to be shielding up again, which again with the problem of no good counter, since the timing on the perfect parry is basically bot perfect, I also tried continuing after I died 10+ times cause I am willing to admit it's partly on my end, BUT HE'D STILL JUST TANK KNIFE AFTER KNIFE. idek how I beat the game on pro mode twice legitimately, he never gave me this much trouble before, but now it's just impossible and I'm done dealing with this games melee problems.

Do I recommend this game? Heck yes, and this may be the first RE I recommend at full price. This b*tch is meaty. I don’t have nostalgia glasses, never played before the remake, but I’ve played a few other REs and would have to rank this one 4th or 5th. 

I miss a few things from RE3R, the dodge first and foremost. The press B to evade system is terrible. The vendor from RE8 felt so much better, you could make huge leaps without collecting butt tons of stuff like RE4. In this game, collect all kinds of crap, and get to repair your knife and buy a spray can. 

Leon, is top tier character. My favorite to play as by far, he is the ultimate selfless guy, and he had become even more competent in this game. Graphics and performance, second to none. 

If you’re choosing between RE4R and RE8, get 8 on sale. Much more fun to play, better (more memorable bosses) and an overall tighter experience. Mendez don’t hold a candle to Lady D.

Before going into detail I should clarify that this is my perspective as someone new to the RE franchise and who never played the original. Everything I will say here is purely my opinion on the subject.

Visual: The visuals are stunning. The characters and monsters are really detailed and that along with the detailed environment helps us immerse into the game. When it comes to monster design, I think they nailed it, especially the design of the elite enemies and of the bosses. Not just are they extremely cool, some of them are really grotesque. While I would not consider this game as extremely terrifying , those grotesque designs, the music and the environment allow some of the encounters with those monsters to suspenseful and stressing.

Gameplay: I found the gameplay to be really fun. The amount of weapons we can get in the game (various handguns, shotguns, rifles, grenades, ect.), the knife mechanics and the map design (things we can explode on enemies, items scattered across the map and strategic positions) were enough to make the gameplay diverse and fun. It also made me have to worry about resource management and have to make strategies.
I found the game to be difficult (played on standard) but not in a frustrating way.

Story: While not the best story in the world, I found the story to be quite compelling. The main characters (Leon and Ashley) are really likeable and the side characters are also really endearing.  As for the villains, I think they lacked a lot on screentime, especially the Saddler. However, I don't think their lack of screentime discredits all of the story and its themes.

My only complaint is that you need a 3rd party utility (RE Framework) to make the game actually playable because the maximum field-of-view camera setting is ridiculously narrow causing motion sickness.

Instead of them trying to dial RE4 back down to a survival game they just went full action again which means that we're probably going to see an exact repeat of history where RE goes too full into action and requires another soft reboot like RE7. The combat can be somehow more awkward than the remakes before that actively suggest that you don't fight all the time while this game forces you into combat every other second while having strange inconsistencies that just sour the taste.

And that night, Raccoon City was wiped out, thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella. Somehow, I made it out. But too many others...weren't so lucky. I was ""asked"" later to join a top-secret government program. Not that I had a choice. The training, the punishing missions...nearly killed me, but at least they kept my mind off everything. If I could just forget what happened that night - the pain, even for a second? This time, it can be different. It has to.

- will call you a cheater, ban you, and take down your YouTube channel if you use mods in their single-player games.
- will add DRM to games to prevent modding, reduce performance, and break compatibility, that no one is asking for. But will let other games remain in an unplayable state, that was ruined by another stupid DRM that they used.
- will bait you to buy the Deluxe Edition for $70 then force you to pay an extra $10 for an asset flip DLC to complete the game, then release a full bundle for only $50 with no option to upgrade for base game owners.

It keeps the standard working formula. It's a RE game. Crazy. Shoot things. Loot things. Find out why virus. 
However, we all know the original story of RE4. Ashley, castle, ""Your right hand comes off?"" those beats. 
(Disclaimer they did rewrite most of Leon's dialogue so quips are to vary)
They made the place look great. Ok cool, check box for those guys.
Story is fantastic, and per usual there is a story difficulty. Check box for those guys.
The gameplay is still absolutely fantastic. Check box for everyone else.
The voice actors for RE4 did a fantastic job once again, this time it feels like it's a passion project rather than work. RE2 leon sounded like someone doing a good job. RE4 Leon sounds like he lives and breathes his work. 
To top it off, Mercenaries is back so you can get extra enjoyment from just doing this arcade game mode. 
BUT then they have Ada's DLC. Seperate Ways. Giving further explanation to your question of ""Where's Ada?"" 
Seperate ways adds some more mechanics and refreshes things, even if for the most part you're just running through the levels in a reverse/different order. Still wonderful to experience.

This is the top tier Resident Evil game money can buy in 2024. Also it has better ballistics (Ashley has no health bar and now she can get down frorm high grounds herself.) she has character development but still annoying af, and Hunnigan is the only black person in the whole game.

Mercaneries game mod is pretty fun, they added Luis as a playable character so that's new, and the mechanics combined with graphics, I can say that you have a quality time on your hands. 

I enjoyed Remake's Separate Ways more then the OG one because the story and story telling is better overall and with new mechanics, the only thing distinguish this dlc from a proper game is you can finish it in 2-3 hours easily.

The three things I like more in the OG is, the ambiance. When you enter the safe room or merchant's dock Serenity theme will play, but in the Remake it only plays when you buying something from the Merchant, basically it only plays when you open up the Merchant menu. And also the  wind, thunder and rain sounds are better overall in the OG. 
Secondly, I didn't like the new shooting range rewarding system. In the OG you get money as a reward, but in Remake it gives you coins and with that coins you get charms and they give you passive bonuses and that's not my cup of tea because they're cheap af when you sell them and they're not that effective. And lastly I like the treasures better in the OG cause I'm old school, OG has less customization, basic just combine it and sell it, but Remake there is too many options/combinations to do. At first it's confusing but you get used to it so it's not that bad if you like more options. So overall great game. 8.5/10

Cinematics are expertly crafted, drawing players deeper into the narrative with immersive storytelling and breathtaking set pieces.

From Leon's determined expression to the grotesque mutations of the game's monstrous foes, every character is rendered with striking realism, adding to the game's immersive experience.

Originally, K2 Inc and external companies Red Works and M-Two were supposed to be involved but after the reception Capcom actually listened and brought it back in house and beefed up the development staff. That alone wasn't enough to quell the fear.
Resident Evil 4 doesn't need a remake right? Sure it has some turds on it like QTE's and having to pause the game to pick up anything or swap weapons but the amazing VR version fixes that. What is there left to do? Cut 80 percent of the game for easy to make sewers?
What happened with RERE3 is sad, but if it had to fail for this game to succeed or to have saved it from the same outsourced fate then I'm shocked to say it was worth it.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956290736

Yes it sets a new bar for remaking a game but remake or not I'm saying it still would be incredible if it weren't one. The remake of RE4 might be one of the greatest games ever made, or at least the best one I have ever played.
I've seen horror, I've seen survival horror and I've seen action horror but I've never seen a game do all three so much and so well especially considering the humor. The original was a GOAT, and changed everything. You can't reinvent third person twice...right? Well don't be surprised if you see a parry in more games after this. Much like the original, what's been done and redone here is likely going to be aped for years to come and if they can even come close I for one welcome it. The original was an action game with a horror atmosphere and a nice briefcase, this remake feels more like a sequel to RE2/RE3/RERE2 than the original was both tonally and mechanically as it's now somewhere between survival horror and action horror and bridges the gap between the two PERFECTLY. It's like someone discovered the missing link.

This will be sacrilege for some but this outdoes the original and I know that's not something easily said or done. I find it's biggest flaw to be some technical complaints I'm going to list off quickly in regards to the REngine's always bad looking Screen Space Reflections, poor Ray Traced Reflections (No raytraced lighting) and brand new ugly hair strand setting you should leave off this is basically a perfect game. I thought the original was GOAT but personally it wasn't my favorite Resident Evil game. I think in terms of preference I was more of a REmake (which has some dated elements) guy or RERE2 type but this has become my favorite Resident Evil game bar none. You can see almost every lesson they've learned making since making Revelations1/2,7 the REREREmaster, RERE2, RERE3 and RE8 and that's incredible to behold in a world of cutting edge tech wasted on the innovation and renovation being reserved for weird business practices and monetization schemes in video games.
I only wish The Mercenaries mode in this game has coop and was more difficult.
If someone were to ask me my favorite game period it would probably be this one. Highly recommended, a must play.

My review for RERE3 can be seen here for comparison:

Resident Evil 4, in my opinion, is far from a horror game, but the survival theme of any Resident Evil game is still very much intact and wonderfully done. Inventory and resource management is tight at all times during the story.

Speaking of the story, I think it was pretty decent. One thing worth noting is that the characthers are quite well done, we can see some great improvement in people we meet, and the antagonists while not being amazing are still serviceable and definitely not boring. 

The combat has more depth into it compared to your average RE title as the game is focused a lot more on action. Overall I think it was fantastic, paired with the resource management and enemy variety, the combat was pretty fun at all times. Add the classic amazing Capcom puzzles and the in-game economy on top of that, and you get a near flawless gameplay I'd say.

In short, superb game. One of my favourites, ever.

It feels like I'm playing both the old game and a completely new one at the same time. My 4080 in 2k said I won't give you 160 fps, but enjoy the stunning visuals at 90-120, and that's it. Leon now feels alive, after intense battles, he breathes just like the player behind the monitor screen. At first, I was disappointed that there is no longer a storage where you can put ammo, but on ""hardcore"", I really felt the need for crafting in this game. The balance on hardcore difficulty forced me to use all types of weapons, and I almost always had the minimum for survival.

[i](The main game is so faithfully recreated that the island with the solders started to feel oppressive, and I got tired of the game after the first episode. In the original, I outright howled at this same place. But keep it up! Then the game picks up and throws in a couple of interesting moments.)[/i]

Resident Evil is always a series of playthroughs, but I've never had the strength to go through it again. But I'm very satisfied with my 25-hour playthrough and the ""B"" grade.

The hunger for survival horror seems to be satisfied for a few more months. A good game that unlocked both old memories and added new ones! This is truly how remake is should be.",1705723975,1707080683,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It's an awesome and faithful remake of the original, staying true to the overall design of the areas while changing and expanding them to make them feel fresh and expansive for exploratory purposes. It was fun seeing what was new and what was the same; no place ever felt like a slog to get through or like it was a copied and pasted directly from the old game. 

I played on Hardcore mode, so my experience might be skewed, but even though some encounters felt somewhat tedious and annoying, I really like how all of the ganados are actually a threat now and actually do seem to strategize with each other (which I remember being a ""selling point"" for the AI back with the old version). The Plagas enemies especially are no joke, and they all feel unique in how they approach you instead of just being another reskinned headburster that'll die in two shots anyway.

The gameplay is solid and fun overall, with each weapon having its uses and appeal. Combat feels quite dynamic, especially with the knife parry system (it's easy to get the hang of, don't worry- just have to remember it exists lol). I do, however, have issues with Leon's movement, which feels rather clunky and slow. I guess usually it's not that big of a problem, but especially during certain boss fights or intense encounters where you're suddenly swarmed with enemies, you really start feeling limited in your mobility. 

The story is pretty much the same at its core, though it has undergone some pretty obvious changes to go for a more serious and ""realistic"" tone. The majority of these changes are good, though. I love how they really honed in on and played up the religious cult nature of Los Iluminados, since in the original game that felt more like a hazy backdrop that was talked about but never really shown. The Plagas in [spoiler]Leon and Ashley's[/spoiler] bodies also comes across as a more urgent problem than in the original game, making the resolution to that particular arc much more satisfying instead of something that just happens along the way. Finally, Leon's still got some funny and cheesy one-liners throughout the game, but I really do miss the original dialogue from him and the other characters... and especially the banter between him and Ramon, which has been completely removed. The lack of old cheese is another one of my few ""issues"" with the game. It's technically not something that *really* impeded my enjoyment of the game, I just really miss it cuz of nostalgia and I do think the game feels a bit emptier without it.

(Also, if you're worried about the story or characters having undergone ""cHanGEs"" for the sake of a certain kind of unwanted messaging, don't be. There's absolutely none of that kind of garbage here.)

I remember playing the hell out of the original version on the Wii back when I was in middle school. Had to have played it at LEAST ten times, if not more.

Although I knew it was coming I had my doubts that it was even needed and I think internally Capcom feel the same way as they clearly think that Resident Evil (2005) is good enough for modern audiences as they have ported the game to every console since its release. Capcom are correct in this belief as the original resident evil 4 is not only one of the best games of its time but one of the greatest games ever made. If someone was to ask me what my top 10 games of all time where, I would struggle to name a large number of them but one thing I know for sure is that resident Evil 4 would be very close to the top.(In-case your curious my top 3 games are 3. Syberia, 2. Resident evil 4, 1. Silent Hill 2). In saying that RE4 is not a perfect game, Far from it in fact. The inability to move while aiming can be annoying, Having to pause the game to switch weapons kills the tension, The villains while memorable, Lack any real depth and characterisation and all their end goals just make them look like Saturday morning cartoon villains. The story is non existent and goes nowhere and the pacing of the game is all over the place and it completely collapses in the final act. Despite these flaws the game is a classic, A genre defining epic that for better and for worse will endure forever. So how do Capcom improve upon this? How do Capcom justify this games existence? Especially when the year before they charged us 60 pounds or 70 dollars for a glorified Resident Evil 4 Tech Demo. Surely they aren't going to just update the graphics, allow us to move while aiming and dynamic weapon switching and say job done. Right? 

When the Remake was finally announced my initial reaction was incredibly excited as I noticed one very interesting change straight away the change from a very sharp but simple looking brown leather jacket in the original to a black bomber jacket in the remake. Instantly I thought of the reference to the the RE 3.5 build which never saw the light of day. In case you don't know RE 4 went through many changes before its release one of them went on to become a brand new franchise called Devil May Cry and the other was going to take place on an air ship where Leon would have hallucinations of some very disturbing and macabre things and one of the hallucinations was a stalker enemy called the hook man. I don't know why it was scrapped. Maybe because it closely resembled another horror franchise that was around at the time. A certain horror franchise that Capcom seems absolutely terrified of even acknowledging its mere existence but that's a story for another day. So I thought about all the things that they could mix up and all the interesting ideas and themes they could incorporate from the years of experience they now had. The so called leaks came in telling us about about a Jester that lived in the sewers, Salazar s pet spider and the confirmation of a section with the hook man . It seemed like the community had a better imagination than Capcom because when the remake released there was none of that. I believe Capcom gave us the safest possible product. A game that they knew could never fail because its resident evil 4 and resident evil 4 is amazing , It takes no risks, it has no ambition and it is creatively bankrupt. If you wanted resident evil 4 with prettier graphics (which already look dated right now) be able to switch weapons in real time and allow you to move while aiming then your wish has been granted but I cant shake the feeling that if the changes are so small and I can play the original on the same platform for a fraction of the price. Why does this game even exist?

Visually the game is impressive on a surface level, its kinda like those really realistic paintings you see from a distance that look like photographs but when you get up close that's when it starts to fall apart as you see all the individual brushstrokes. There is a large number of reused assets that just screams laziness, blurry low res textures that stick out like a sore thumb and intense rain effects thrown in at every possible opportunity to mask these issues as much as possible. Also theirs too many reused character models which you can get away with in the castle and island sections as the enemies in these places usually wear robes or masks but in the village it just looks tacky as you see the same character models over and over again. sound design is fantastic and the animations are fluid and responsive. The guns feels good to use as-long as your using mouse and keyboard controls because its not fun playing this game with a controller. Stealth mechanics are added which wasn't necessarily needed but a welcome addition none the less. the parrying system is fantastic and adds a whole new dimension to how the knife can work in future RE games. 

Where the game fails is in its boss arenas which for the most part are completely unchanged and due to the cramped nature of these arenas and an inconsistent dodge mechanic combined with Leon's more realistic sluggish movement, Boss battle are tedious and frustrating. Even when they change them up it doesn't make them good as it seems to me at certain points in development even the developers asked themselves why does this game exist and they had to justify that answer by tacking on the laziest changes possible. like now Salazar can climb up walls and fire black goo at us and the iconic boss battle with the xenemorph like creature  that was full of tension in the original is absolutely devoid of tension or atmosphere in the remake because Leon wont shut up for 5 seconds. Its very difficult to be scared when you constantly hear smart ass one liners every 3 seconds and the dodge button is the same every time. This is another step backwards from the original as the QTEs in the original would sometimes change the buttons to press to keep you alert and on your toes. The villains are also a step backwards as they get the job done but they are not as memorable as the original and how is it possible that Salazar has less character development in this remake than he did in the original. To be fair some characters are fleshed out more in the separate ways DLC but that is blocked behind a paywall.

I suppose your wondering why im recommending this game despite all my criticism. The reason is because its still resident evil 4 and you cant go wrong with that. Maybe you'll get more out of this game than I did as its clear my opinion is not the general consensus and that's okay. Clearly Its me that's the problem, Not the game.

Masterpiece in my book. Thrilling game from the beginning all the way to the end, never a dull moment and always kept me on my toes.

(2 was missing the B-scenario stuff, felt like half a remake, 3 was just a terrible remake, Capcom doesn't care about RE3, look at Umbrella Chronicles!). Granted 2/3 were great games in their own right but as remakes.... meh.

So I went into this with ""ok, lets see what they screwed up or cut out..."" and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game was very close. It trimmed a bit of fat but the game was a very respectful remake. MORE OF THIS CAPCOM! also DLC was good, wish Capcom could go back to 2 and give us a true B-scenario for RE2.

Gameplay was solid, visuals were great and there was little to no retconning from the original. In fact they canonised a plot from Darkside Chronicles which was impressive. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT! Like RE1 remake where they keep it mostly the same but add to the lore.

It's kinda funny and sad that the worst thing about this game is Ada's voice acting. I don't advocate bullying her off the internet but facts are facts, it was an awful performance. Shame they didn't get the RE2 voice actor.",1706999750,1706999750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Movement is a huge upgrade except when you stun an enemy, it's like I can't run as fast as I would like to for following up with a CQC finish but other than that it's great. It seems relatively faithful but there does seem to be a certain amount of game content cut that seemingly made the original longer or perceptively different due to some environments being cut.

All in all this is a pretty great remake though. Like the other RE remakes some game-play time has been shaved off from content being cut but other than that the game is long enough and I'd say my first play-through was thoroughly enjoyable. I got a bit lazy with this one on the difficulty and played on assisted cause I just wanted to have a great time without a whole lot of stress like I have dealt with lately. 

I am glad I waited for this game to mature with updates. I had some texture pop in there but it was not too too bad. It ran really well on my setup and played spectacular on some really nice graphical settings. Everything was pretty good, gun-play, combat, environments, enemies, story, cut-scenes, graphics, etc, you get the idea. I don't even know why I am reviewing this, with the sheer stupid number  of overwhelmingly good reviews that already speak a lot for this game? I guess I thought I would just add a few coins to the stack. 

Is it re-playable? Yep, started a new game+ right after I beat it. This one is a good escape from reality when you need a vacation from crap life in the mundane working world and BS 
dealing with toxic stuff most people don't enjoy dealing with.

Should four-five year old even play that sort of games at all? No.
Did I understood anything, what was even going on? Also no.
But did I fell in love instantly at this video game series? Absolutely YES.
And been on that path these many years for now, but these days my faith has been tested in so many ways.

Don't get me wrong, there is some aspects, what I do love about of this game. Parrying, atmosphere, graphics, gameplay is more smooth in general, they also gave Luis his proper screen time and list goes on. But in the same time the gameplay is too ""confusing"", than it should be.

Let me explain..

So what I'm meaning with this, when the gameplay in general is more smooth and more in motion, so many different aspects may happen and affects in your game at the same time. When someone is grabbing you from front, there's already one guy throwing some axes at you. Or they do a 180 degree turn middle of a run (""Chainsaw Ganado"", I am looking at you right now). Or how they can grab you from behind something like half a meter afar (I ones tried counting, how many times I got grab like this in single ""Mercenaries"" game. I stopped counting after ""six""), that damn ""stun locking"" what enemies do to you, how enemies can calculate your moving pattern (and they know exactly, where and when to throw their weapon), enemy spawn location is terrible, how they may plan to throw dynamite at end of a ladder, when you are stepping on to them (and you cannot stop/interrupt this animation in midstream) and how dynamites do damage through a f*cking roof, but definitely my biggest problem is the input lag. 

Sometimes you need to press four-five times, before the main character even loads his gun. This will affect in every combat situation in the game, when you melee, reload, drop down, change weapons etc. Have completely lost count, how many times I have died, becaz Leon just won't parry (this happens in every difficulty level, so Professional's ""Perfect Parry"" is not behind all of this)...
My PC won't cause itself this problem, I won't have this kind of problem in any other games what I may play. It's only in this game.

So as a fan of the series, I would LOVE to like these remakes. But it's REALLY hard how bad they usually screw these remakes up (2&3, SO MUCH CUT CONTENT AHBJFIPHBIEFW), and like why on earth Ada is in this game at the first place? Like for seriously, everytime she talks, walks or even for the love of God THINKS, it gives the image, that even she herself don't want to be a part of this game. Everything she says is so monotone, that it seriously hurts to even watch her cutscenes (so just been skipping them). Have only played Ada's DLC campaign one's, and that's enough for me. Best 10€ what I had used :D

And I would want to meet that genius, who though of redoing Leon's one-liners. I maybe haven't heard the lamest lines in any other video game, that I've played so far (and this comes from a guy, who have played ""Duke Nukem Forever"").

So why I won't simply stop playing these games and focus on the originals instead?
Firstly, I paid SO MUCH money at the time of purchase. So I want to get as much as possible ""out"" from my gaming experience.
Secondly, mods.
Thirdly, achievements. I want to get all achievements in (most) every RE -games. But with this one I may just give up. I really don't like this game in general and how bs this is.

I am missing only six achievements with this game, but really have zero interest to even start the hole game at all.
So please, don't pay the full price. Just wait, when you can get it cheap at discount. You thank me later.

So I'll just gonna go and play the true RE4, with that I am at least having fun :D",1706300752,1706699047,False,5,1,0.511723518371582031,0,True,False,False

[h1]Overall: 10/10. Perfect.[/h1]

[b]Bravo CAPCOM. Nailed it. Best Remake just like Dead Space Remake. This game is a love letter to RE4 OG and fans.I cannot stop playing this game,  I loved the original but this holy hell Capcom went all out. RE4 is the best and the most beloved one in the Resident Evil game series. Also one of the greatest games ever made.[/b]

[olist][*][h2]Story:[/h2]10/10, obviously they made some changes to make the story make more sense but the pacing fire and they actually gave characters like Luis and Ashley more depth, also making us learn more about luis’ backstory with saddler and having more screentime where he would join leon in battle compared to the original where he would just stay mysterious/ disappear and Ashley making us absolutely adore her with the way she interacts with us throughout the story. She also does stuff to contribute to progressing in the game compared to the original Ashley where would get in the way and be annoying asf, she’s useful for once.

[*][h2]Graphics: [/h2]10/10 this game is so gorgeous, the environment and just everything is chefs kiss to the point it feels like you’re watching a movie, cutscenes and everything feels so cinematic and just clean. I am enjoying this game in 4k. 

[*][h2]Gameplay:[/h2] 10/10 it’s so fun using the parry mechanic against enemies followed by the iconic roundhouse kick. Since it’s new gen the controls are WAY better than the original to the point I’d play this and never get tired of it. The same weapons from the original like the TMP, red 9, broken butterfly, striker etc. all make their return and you can upgrade them with the money you loot along with some new weapons.

[*][h2]Soundtrack:[/h2] 10/10 I love that you can change the soundtrack to the original anytime. That's what I wanted.  I love the original soundtrack of serenity and save room so much. They keep both the original and remake soundtrack. So you can change whenever you want. The escape at the ending soundtrack was so epic from the Remake.  Thanks, Capcom. 

[*][h2]Boss: [/h2]10/10 Some bosses were cut out however but iconic ones like Del lago, el gigante, verdugo etc. are all here and playout the same way as the original but just more modern and they’re really not playing around, even the regular villagers are crazy doing combos by shoving or punching you into another villager that attacks you.

[*][h2]Side quests:[/h2] 10/10 the goat our merchant makes a return and he’s making us do quests so we can trade for other items, so you won’t just be going around collecting treasure you’ll also be hunting and completing side missions to earn even more money and upgrades.[/olist]

[i]The original is my favorite but this remake took the spot, definitely buy this game it’s so worth the wait and money, the nostalgia from both playing the original game and hearing all those rumors 3 years ago about an re4 remake hit so damn hard, we’re finally here. W game W devs.[/i]

[h3]Big Request to Capcom. Please give us Resident Evil 5 Remake after this. 
Thanks for your hard work and dedication.[/h3]",1680897545,1706661343,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I mean, it is good to see Leon return for another adventure in the series and the game itself is quite a playable action game. But the suspense and the horror magic of the earlier games is gone, and what you are left with is just a headshot shooter with a half dozen puzzles to work through.

The Chainsaw Demo was good, but that is as good as it gets. Once you have reached the village, things turn quite mechanical from that point onwards. I just felt I was turning up at these locations, shooting zombies before they got near me, finding door keys, and then on my way again.

Also, the story was weak. I got why the villages were zombified, from the earlier games, but I did not understand why I was encountering Plate Armour springing into life. Didn't make sense to me.

There is more story content supposedly in the DLC 'Separate Ways' but I don't feel inclined to follow it.

Kennedy, the game's protagonist, they are immersed in a chilling and mysterious atmosphere. The narrative introduces players to a sinister rural European village filled with a disturbing cult and monstrous creatures. The shift from zombies to more intelligent and aggressive foes adds a layer of tension and unpredictability to the gameplay. The game's controls are unexpectedly responsive and intuitive, allowing for a seamless experience during intense encounters. The addition of context-sensitive actions adds a strategic element to gameplay, requiring players to make split-second decisions that can determine their survival. The inventory system, where items are arranged in a briefcase, adds a layer of resource management, forcing players to prioritize and make tough choices. 
The arsenal of weapons available to players is diverse, and upgrading them by collecting currency from fallen foes adds a rewarding progression system. The merchant, a mysterious character who appears throughout the game, provides an opportunity for players to purchase and sell items, adding another layer of strategy and progression to the experience. the pacing of Resident Evil 4 remake is expertly crafted, with a balance of intense action sequences and moments of quiet exploration.
The original Resident Evil 4 is a timeless masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the survival horror genre. They really did their best to recreate this amazing game. Its gameplay, atmospheric design, and comically horrible one-liners continues to captivate players, solidifying its place as one of the greatest video games of all time. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer to survival horror, Resident Evil 4 remake is an essential experience that deserves a spot in any gamer's collection.

It's a 3rd person action game where you shoot, kick, and blow up everything in your path in amazing set piece after amazing set piece. The combat is extremely tight, enemies are threatening and aggressive, there's tons of treasure to find and weapons to upgrade, and the game is as easy or as hard as you want it to be with NG+ available across multiple playthroughs.

Do you need the DLC? No. In fact, skip it, it's stupid. I preordered so I could play it as quick as possible. (This does not include the Separate Ways DLC.)

Is it worth full price? Yes. If you get it on sale, even better. Just because the game can be beaten in less than 5 hours does not mean it's not good. There are achievements and rewards for rushing through the game for a quick clear time, but as someone who utterly demolished the original I still got 9 hours on my first Standard Difficulty playthrough. And fully completing this one still took me 70 hours.

For the returning RE4 enjoyers: This is what your brain remembers RE4 (2005) being. Yes, all the voice actors are different, and it threw me off for an hour or two. But it does not matter because everyone positively owns their character. Leon still has baller one liners, Ashley is an actual human woman now, the Merchant is even funnier than the original, Ada actually has range now, Krauser is a (much younger sounding) 80's action villain, Saddler is 100x better in his final moments, and Lois is still an average guy who is quite the ladies man.

The action has been dialed up to 11, every set piece worth keeping is there, the game is freaking LONGER somehow, and the attention to the little details in every aspect of the game is just above and beyond our current standard for remakes. This makes RE3 look like a fever dream, and I personally think this makes RE2 look like they were playing it way too safe. It's that good. If you liked the original and just want to enjoy that hit of when video games had more soul, this is a no-brainer. This is fan service in all the right ways.

Micro complaints:
- The laser sight not being available on more weapons is a crime. An unlockable that lets the attachment go all over the place would have been awesome.
- This whole stop-firing-and-wait-for-the-crosshair thing was a cute gimmick in the previous RE-releases, but I'm supremely over it. Please come up with something else, it is not fun. Just because I can ignore it does not mean it fails to detract from my shooting experience. ESPECIALLY if I see RE5 remade, come up with ANYTHING else, PLEASE.
- The unlockable cosmetics are 70% garbage. Masks and sunglasses? Really? Was your collectibles designer suffering from chronic migraines? Give our heroes some fun clothes to wear if you're gonna make silly cosmetics. Especially Ashley. The poor woman has been wearing armor since I unlocked it because it is a barren wasteland besides Leon the heavily-sunglassed. Give Ashley the cultist robe or something, c'mon!
- Collectible rewards across the board feel more like ticking a box at this point. Weapon skins or unlimited ammo like RE7 would have been fun. It just feels half-baked or like DLC bait. There is SO little of substance to  unlock it's surprising we get points and unlockables at all. Do more or just drop it entirely, I feel teased and unfinished.

To the avalanche of bizarre and cringe complaints I've seen:
- Shut up about Ashley's clothes. SHUT UP ABOUT ASHLEY'S CLOTHES. Her redesign is FINE you slobbering basement-dwellers. She is still STACKED for our pleasure. If you need panties that bad, go BUY SOME. I hope they release DLC that exclusively puts MORE clothes on her just to hurt you single-brain-cell-collective oxygen thieves.
- Shut up about the voice actors. SHUT UP ABOUT THE VOICE ACTORS. Everyone is wonderful and you're just crying because the world has changed. I know life is difficult but go cyberbully a politician or something. Y'know, complain about something RELEVANT. 
- I hope Lily Gao voices Ada for the rest of the series, just to spite the cartoonish anger against her having the audacity to voice a character. The remake is less campy overall, but it's still a silly game with even sillier dialogue.

I'm proud to say that the remake is absolutely a worthy successor to that legacy. 

[b]Plot[/b]
Many aspects of the games plot and progression have been tweaked and altered, removing all the QTE segments and many of the originals goofier moments [spoiler](giant Salazar mecha, anyone?)[/spoiler] and replacing them with more grounded action set-pieces. Even if you have the original game committed to memory, the remake will still have a lot of surprises in store for you. The result is that the game's pacing is vastly improved and the story is more in depth in some areas than the original. The best example of this being Leon and Ashley who are a bit more fleshed out as characters and their relationship more believable. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
For starters, while the original tended to lean more into the category of action, the Remake firmly brings things back into the realm of survival horror with a tone that is much darker and the Las Plagas cult portrayed as more brutal than the 2005 version. While the gameplay will feel instantly familiar to anyone who played the original, the remake's several upgrades and qol features elevate the experience. The addition of a quick-select for weapons was especially welcome, as was the ability to use your knife to parry most melee attacks and some ranged attacks. The limited crafting system that allows you to create new ammo as needed was also quite useful. 

[b]Vocal Performances[/b]
Sadly, this is the one area where I felt the remake was inferior to the original. While I had knee-jerk reactions to the likes of Leon, Ashley and Luis's new voice actors, I admit, they grew on me by the end of the game. However Ada, Salazar, Krauser, Saddler and a few others were pretty terrible across the board.

Don't make the same mistake I did, it's a trap. Do yourself a favor and just play on normal difficulty. Hardcore is an unbalanced mess that is in no way in relation with the original game. It feels nothing like the original. Enemies resist staggers, and are way too aggro compared to how sluggish as hell Leon is, while in the original you had much more snappy and responsive controls.

I've completed the original in Professional multiple times, and there's absolutely nothing about it that helps you be ""better prepared"" for Hardcore in the remake.

And guess what? You can't lower the difficulty if you're playing on Hardcore. So now I need to start a fresh new run which means I've just wasted 3 hours of my life. Thanks Capcom.

Aside from that, everything else about the game is great though. They just really need to fix this one stupid mistake that can absolutely destroy someone's first impression of the game. I'll absolutely change my review to a positive one if they do.

EDIT: nevermind. Just learned that Crapcom decided to incorporate an extra layer of DRM POST-LAUNCH that breaks compatibility with mods, cheats, etc. on top of a performance loss.

RE engine keeps impressing me with its optimization. The real high-note of this game is the action, it really nails the micro-management you have to do while in a fight against a horde of zombies. Just the boss fights that felt a bit lacking, being kind of basic sometimes. The game isn't as scary as it could have been, but it has some scary bits, i just feel like they could have been longer, mainly the Ashley's part. The devs could really have capitalized on the 'missing of action' while playing with her, not giving her a way to defend herself so quickly. The story is fine, nothing outstanding. I think they missed the opportunity for the main characters to talk about their story in non-relevant parts, who even is Leon and Ashley besides an agent and the president's daughter? Instead, we have them grunting or groaning 90% of the time they open their mouths.

Instead of traversing each area in a linear fashion like before, you now have opportunities to explore each sector at your own pace and even go back to previous areas in order to unlock treasures, access previously blocked rooms or fight new optional bosses. I'm not that fan of this backtracking and I also find it frustrating to go from one end of the region to another in hopes of finding that one missing kew or treasure and the devs seem to know this was frustrating as they let you buy treasure maps to make sure you don't miss out too late. Especially in harder difficulties where money and ammo are precious.

The only thing that I think tarnishes it just a bit is the overall design of the RE engine. The way you move and shoot is too slow, tactical, methodical, sluggish, weighty - whatever you wanna call it. It's too ""that"" for the action forward RE 4. They should have played with the physics and aiming, and the movement speed and agility. You can move much more freely in cutscenes but control like an old man. Sprucing all that up would have made the game damn near perfect, but as is, it's still a blast, albeit just the smallest bit incongruent with itself.

Besides that nitpick, the game really is awesome. Besides the occasional traversal stutter here and there, it runs pretty smooth and it designed pretty well. The story is entertaining and the locations are varied, taking you to distinct and different looking and feeling locations frequently. As a linear title, it's really one of the best in a long while. The journey feels epic and paced very well. Really feels like you run the gauntlet with Leon, and earned that escape.

Content wise the game is just... complete. Everything about it is designed to hit that feeling of satisfaction, a finely curated experience where the developers cared about your time and effort. Perhaps because it was from 2005, but games mostly don't feel like this anymore and besides a few refreshes, the original game is mostly preserved from what I can tell proving the game design from back then just really shines. No pointless fluff, no egregious hand holding ( the game is kinda tough) you cant just tape the joystick up and beat the game on easy. It takes advantage of the fact that games are freakin' interactive ffs, they require YOU. 

Another thing I should add is that the game definitely has some legs. I beat the story in 20ish hours first go around, and played it a couple more times to unlock some stuff. But then almost a year later, I got the DLC played that a few times, revisited the main campaign and got all the challenges through SEVERAL more runs. Those little goals and secrets make the game fun and dial up the replayabilty through the freaking roof. Other RE titles are not like this, there are attempts but some are thin story and content wise, or writing wise, or gameplay wise. Almost every encounter in this game feels iconic and just right, you know? Village felt more generic, 7 was interesting but it felt shallow, not as deep and content rich as 4. Perhaps a small budget? Its just a family and like 5 goo monsters. 2 was really cool, with awesome design and replayability, then 3 felt like a joke. Why so short? So truncated... 

Anyway, I hope they can really overhaul 5 cause there was some good bits in the original game. 6 was apparently terrible, so might as well fix that too huh?

But what I wanna know is... is there a freaking point to these stories? Are they going anywhere or are they just designed to go on forever? With this remake universe, they have a chance to tell a better overarching narrative. And WHERE TF is a remake for RE1? What a glaring omission, jeez.

[b] THANK YOU CAPCOM!! [/b]

I will play this game for as long as I can. I enjoyed it that much

- Fun: 10/10

- Story: Pretty good, of course not RE2 level, but RE4's focus is not the story, but mote so the gameplay!

- Replayability: Can't wait to start another playthrough with my Pinstripes costume. Many challanges and many unlockables e.g (Ashley armor costume)

- Ashley mechanics: GREAT. I was actually blown away by how good the mechanics are! Ashley is not an obstacle in the remake.

- Graphics: amazing. I turned off space reflections though. Best iteration of RE engine!

- Performance: ran very well on my mid-range GPU. I got ftame drops in one area in the entire game (courtyard) but 99% of the time i got fps drop free performance on high-max settings, I don't know the exact number though, bevause I capped my fps.

I am seriously blown away by the quality of this game. The voice acting, graphics, combat!! (New things like parrying) the guns, everything. This game is amazing. RE 2 Remake was top tier as well, but this one... this one is just perfect.

The remake brought a refresh of the best game from back of 2005 with better moves for Leon, movement, story, graphics, I mean so much is improved from the original game that it's mind blowing if you compare RE4R of to game cube or playstation 2 version of the game back in the day.

Unlike back in those days, in the current present I have an Super Ultra Wide Monitor, specially the Samsung OLED G9 95SC with a Intel 13900k, 64 gb of DDR5, and RTX 4080 Aorus Master. My experience with the game is a deep immersion that is truly amazing.  I ran this game on Custom with everything to the max without any preset. I will tell you I ran this game depending the level I get between 90-165 FPS. So don't be afraid to push your card to the max. It is worth it!

The same as most people who played this, I was very used to the original RE4. Meaning I had expectations and fears that this game would get content cuts just like RE3R. The moment I was in the starting village with the horde of Ganados, I felt so pleasantly challenged and surprised. Leon felt responsive and real. And the terror I felt when Dr Salvador entered the arena was exhilarating! The gun play felt right and the parry system made me switch my mindset constantly to not only think about my own attacks, but memorize the enemies attacks, too. Which was something you barely had to do in any of the Resident Evil Games. It made me so happy, and all that only in the first 15 minutes of the game! 

The rest of the game only got better. Every single character me and Leon met got met with different emotions. From protectiveness and care to caution and sharpness. Leon's closed off heart felt like it was bleeding with love and care for the people he cared about. And it showed with every character at some point, as much as he liked to hide it (To say I love Leon would be an understatement.)

Though there are obviously things that could be better about this game, I will ignore all of it and rate this game with my personal feelings towards it. Since it brought me so much glee.

The game is pretty repetitive: clear the area of enemies, solve how to open a path to next area, clear the area of enemies, solve how to open a path to next area, fight a boss, clear the area of enemies etc etc. There are little action (and sneaking) sections here and there, which breaks this loop occasionally, but they are not the strongest parts of the game. The mood of the game stays pretty much the same the whole time and it's all about action action action. It lacks interesting puzzles, villains or areas, scary parts or changes of pacing; basically the stuff that makes a good RE game for me. Ashley is annoyingly badly written character and other characters are not that much better. This being said, I like the action, there are fun mods around, and it's a fun game. It has it's moments, even tho i think it's a shallow story and repetitive action game. It didn't hit me like the better RE games, but I still recommend it.

With the release of 2 Remake, it set the bar really high for REmakes, so they decided to do 3 Remake which was under a different team but it did miss the mark with what a remake should be. 

So when 4 Remake was announced of course people were worried about cut content and that it wont be faithful to the source material but after it released with my own experience and by seen others as well, I'd say they have hit a home run with this remake, even I say it's equal or better than the REmake from years ago.

I do have a few nit picks but they are minor and that they don't ruin the experience. One of them is Ada's new voice actor, I feel like the performance is quite wooden and that it feels quite out of place, don't get me wrong she is trying her best, I feel like they could've brought back Jolene Anderson back to play as Ada but I don't mind as much. Edit I am more used to Lily Gao as Ada after putting so many hours in it and even in the Separate Ways DLC. Did she deserve the amount of hate no way but she did deserve some criticism but I feel like the more she practices and have a better direction to go in, I feel like she would be amazing but not everyone is perfect.

Another nit pick is that sometimes that the prompts have a bit of a delay and it kinda screws with me when I am in some tense situations, like when I am in low health and I just got hit trying to open my inventory is a bit slow when I am trying to heal but I have had that rarely but when it does it's a tiny bit annoying. Edit: I haven't had that happen to me anymore and I feel like they sorted that out in a patch ages ago.

Honestly this game is really amazing and the positives really outshine my nit picks and I always have so much fun when I play this game and I am already on my second play through out of so much to come. I am looking forward to see what they have planned for future DLC after they release the Mercenaries mode, hopefully separate ways and maybe something to with Krauser, but we will have to wait and find out. Edit: With the release of the free update to the Mercenaries mode to add Ada and Wesker as playable characters along with Leon's Pinstripe Outfit and Ada's Dress. Even adding the Docks as a stage that makes 4 as the same of how many stages in the OG but more Characters in the Remake but only 2 are just cosmetic than gameplay difference. They even added a hidden objective to get Leon's RPD outfit, which is to get S+ on every stage as every character. Well done

On the 20th September 2023 they released the long awaited Separate Ways DLC and they improved on the original one with more exploration, they incorporated the grapple hook into combat and into exploration which is an amazing new feature. In this version you actually start in the castle (before Leon is actually fighting the horde of Villagers in the Village section), and you save Luis getting executed by the cult and before you leave the main hall of the castle you actually fight a boss which is a great introduction to combat. I love how they expanded on this version while making Wesker more prominent in the story, even they added a cutscene of him hinting at a 5 remake. They also added the missing area's from the main story like the Laser Room, the cable car and even the IT boss fight which is a nice way to expand the story. Overall they knocked this DLC way out of the park.

So in conclusion I highly recommend this game to everyone who is either fan of Resident Evil or someone who wants to get into it and I would rate it like high nines or even a ten.

Note: With what Capcom is doing by adding DRM to their games is really fucking stupid but in my opinion leaving loads of negative reviews isn't going to do a whole bunch. I'd say go on twitter maybe go on their website and make a complaint there will do more than just steam. Will they lose me as a fan of Resident Evil no, Will I still buy their games yes, cause my love of the franchise doesn't make me want to stop playing their games cause I enjoy them so much. But at the end of the day I am only one man with different opinions.",1680181751,1705937210,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, this game is very good. It plays very well, it looks and sounds great. There is a load of side content as well. It is genuinely a great game.

The problem is, it is not THAT different from the original. What original RE4 achieved was a revolution. It feels pretty much like a modern game. The bar that RE4 has set is just so high, so that modern remake simply can't be as much of an improvement as RE2 Remake was to the original.

And then again, RE5 and RE6 were just a variation of RE4 formula with a focus on features that have become ubiquitous, like co-op and over the top storytelling.

Resident Evil 4 is phenomenal! 

The positives out weight the negatives for me but I do hope there will be a few updates to solve the optimization issues.

This game will stand the test of time and does the original Resident Evil 4 more justice and then some. Play the original Resident Evil 4 as well by the way. 

This game shows alot of growth from he previous Resident Evil 4.
 
Leon S. Kennedy going back into unknown territory, and horror in order to recover the U.S. President's daughter has never been more fun!

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+Great story
+Great gameplay.
+Great lighting. 
+Great animations.
+Great attention to details. 
+Smart and intuitive AI.
+Great guns.
+Great gore.
+Awesome martial arts and knife fighting.
+Good rpg elements involving the firearms, body armor, and knives.
+Has more random crit chance and stagger in order to make each play through unique.
+The more serious tone seems to fit the game's story more.
+The shooting range gacha is an interesting mechanic. 
+Weapons have a nice amount of reverb, bass, crunch, and impact.
+Mercenaries mode makes a return!!!
[h1]Summary of the pros:[/h1]
You are going to like the well rounded mechanics of the game in general. Every part of this game has something for someone. 

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-Could be better optimization.
-Some may or may not like the story due to the changes in the dialogue, the character's personalities, and or otherwise.
-Majority of the laser sights from the original game are not here in the Remake. But that was in order to implement a crit chance and stagger system that isn't as constant and more random and crosshair based. (I say crosshair based due to the crosshair having an effect on the crit chance and stagger chance). You may or may not like this.
[h1]Summary of the cons:[/h1]
The game is divisive in nature. The story, changes in tone, and gameplay mechanics are not for everyone. So you might be stricken with nostalgia for the original by the changes.

I really enjoy this game, it is presented with love and sincerity, many stories have been clarified and extended, some have been improved, such as the accents in OG. Leon's character is very interesting, his character development is extraordinary and makes sense, where someone who survived the outbreak and was betrayed makes him have trust issues, Ashley here is even more loved and loved, he no longer screams like a baby bird who can't. flying, he's got some interesting self-development too. from being timid at first, and slowly fighting the situation through dialogue with Leon.
Ada isalso cooler, Ada is still mysterious and can always attract the eyes of men.
Luis is increasingly loved here because of her motivation and relationship with Umbrela, and her sad death here makes us feel even more responsible for eliminating Krauser for Luis' sake.
Krauser, even though his voice is a bit strange, is still manlier and more manly with his new appearance.


The character designs are all without debate, they all look cool, I like all the graphic appearances presented, Leon looks a little more mature, Ada also like that too, Ashley is a little more mature with her model face. Luis appears like a female predator who is flirtatious and very cool, Ganado looks scary, Dr Salvador, who is much scarier and more intimidating than OG, also looks scary, and the wordless regenerator is extraordinary.

In terms of gameplay and atmosphere, the remake is awesome, I enjoyed it and you can tell that by the amount of time I spent in it. But let's not forget that there's the original that is supposed to be respected and one cannot but compare the remake with the OG.
That being said, my main complaint is that the game lost its charm. Capcom tried to make the plot look more serious. Like as if it's even possible to make a ""typical B-movie about a cult kidnapping the president's daughter and using a deadly virus to rule the world"" serious? Well, the main story line (surprise!) remained the same but all the characters now have poker faces and act respectively which gives you cognitive dissonance and the feeling that the game hasn't decided what it wants to be. Capcom nerfed the cutscenes, characters, chemistry between them, their charisma, the Ganados and, last but not least, the jokes to please the minorities who always get offended.

Pros:
- Intense action.
- Graphics, design.
- Ashely model's breasts physics.
- ¡Cogedlo!

Cons:
- No more those beautiful, insane Ganado voices, such a loss! The new Ganados are just mild. Some say that that's because the OG Ganados spoke a Mexican dialect which was wrong and (OMG!) could offend Spanish people. Well, if Russian speakers do not get offended when almost every film and game where there're Russian voice lines has ridiculous voice acting, and we just smile instead, then why are Spanish so sensitive?
- Krauser is no longer a Giga Chad (neither by voice, nor by actions), Louis is no longer a macho; Ada, though, may look more attractive but what her English voice actress did should be considered a crime. The OG Ashley WAS a scared kid, wheres the new Ashley is just a hot chick who PLAYS the victim. And lastly, Leon, who was a confident handsome enjoying his adventure and making jokes is now a slightly depressed man who's ""seen things"" and ""has got a job to do"".
- The antagonists lost their charisma completely (specifically, Salazar and Saddler).
- Most of the cutscenes and dialogues have been nerfed. All jokes and lines that would sound sexist nowadays have been removed. I understand that no big company has the balls to confront the SJWs and ""cancel culture"" and Capcom isn't an exception but this is really crossing the line; Capcom didn't even try to stand for what they once believed was right and what (surprise!) the target audience loves. Apparently, TA no longer matters as it will just tolerate everything.

Cons (applicable to Hardcore and first playthrough):
- Knives have been nurfed: from now on, they have durability and last for ~3 hits depending on the attack type.
- Bosses' weak spots still require knives (2-3), so if you don't have any - good luck to you.
- Melee has been nerfed: Leon is slow, no more 180 degree hits, no more QTE-dashes during boss or Novistador fights - they just hit you hard every time.
- Some areas seem to have respawning enemies, such as Novistadors.
- Only weapons and sprays can be stored in your storage.",1705723921,1705723921,False,8,1,0.514519631862640381,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 4 Remake was my first game in the Resident Evil franchise, and boy did this shit rock my socks off. Not only did this game introduce me to one of my new favorite video game franchises, but it’s also made its way into my top 3 videogames of all time and is my personal GotY for 2023.

[h2] Pros [/h2]

[list]
[*]Every weapon on the large list of ballistics is unique, useful and fun to use (aside from the Punisher, fuck the Punisher). No pistol, shotgun, SMG, Rifle, or Magnum will feel the same, but they’re all useful for certain play styles and situations.

[*]Ashley is fine as fuck. Wish I could smash.

[*]Upgrading those same weapons feels insanely fun to do. You can feel them get more and more powerful as you slowly upgrade them. It’ll have you doing multiple playthroughs just to get every single weapon upgraded to the max.

[*]Ashley is best RE bae.

[*]Enemies are expertly designed, and cause the game to never have a dull moment. There’s a ton of enemy variety, and almost every enemy requires a different strategy to take them down. Every now and then mini bosses are thrown into the mix to make you strategize even more. Bosses are amazing as well, with great designs, fun set pieces, and challenging but fun gameplay.

[*]Ashley is best videogame babe of all time.

[*]The new parrying system introduced to this Remake is perfect for how aggressive enemies can be and the durability system makes it super balanced. Something that’s easy to use, but hard to master.

[*]They gave Ashley a gigantic dump truck.

[*]This game might hold the best gameplay loop of all time. Pulling out the best weapon for the situation, using it to hit an enemies weak spot, causing them to stun, and then, if the coast is clear, running in to melee the enemy, causing the other enemies to fly back with your kick, is so fun and satisfying. They had to have put some type of drug that gets into your system through your eyeballs in this game cuz I’ve been severely addicted for the past 8 months.

[*]They gave Ashley enhanced ballistics.

[*]This game also might have the best inventory system of all time. Every item, weapon, and resource has its own size, which takes up part of the space in your attache case. Sometimes you’ll have to reorganize your items or discard them entirely to make space. It adds another layer of strategy to the game.

[*]I would do unspeakable things to and for Ashley.

[*]The improved treasure system is great too. It makes you think about what gems you’ll be utilizing with what treasures before selling them. Yet another layer of strategy that’s added.

[*]I want Ashley to hit me with her car.

[*]I’ve played through this game 35+ times and have put in around 400+ hours throughout all the different consoles I own it on. This game never gets old. There’s secret items to unlock by beating specific difficulties within a certain time limit. There’s secret skips to learn within the main game that’ll help you beat the game within that time limit. And even after unlocking and beating everything offered, the game is still so much fun that it’ll have you coming back for more.

[*]I've spent precisely 300 of those hours staring at Ashley.

[*]For an RE game, the writing here for the story is surprisingly great. Characters have depth and their own arcs. Previous games feel like they had an effect on certain characters, and events within this game hold emotional weight and cause characters to grow.

[*]Ashley is the best character of all time.

[*]The locations you run around in this game are super interesting, and are some of the best locations in gaming. The Village and Castle are settings in gaming that won’t be forgotten about anytime soon.

[*]I want Ashley to spoon feed me baby food.

[*]This game easily has the best sound design of all time. Every weapon has its own sound when being fired that echoes throughout the area that sounds amazing and makes the guns feel even better to use, and the sounds that play when a bullet comes into contact with an enemy is super satisfying to hear and is a great indicator that you’ve actually landed your shot.

[*]I want Ashley to sneeze into my mouth.

[*]This is the best Remake of all time. Gameplay has been improved. Bosses have been improved. Island is now fun. The story has been improved. The characters have been improved. Brand new weapons have been added. Brand new locations have been added. Brand new side missions have been added. The treasure system has been improved. The visuals have improved. The sound design has improved, etc. There is not a single thing that this Remake doesn’t improve on.

[*]I wish Ashley was real.

[*]The price for this game is amazing. Most games are $70 now, but this masterpiece costs $60, and is much better than most other triple A games that have the $70 price tag.

[*]I want Ashley to sit on my face.

Interesting plot, dramatic, cinematic action and thriller with convenient control - I played with xbox series x gamepad, interesting characters especially Leon and Ashley with good qualities. And action. The ""Separate Ways"" too, it's very good that they made it. But there are disadvantages that are repeated in Resident Evil - not taking damage fairly, the player reacts and the character is slow or the ballistics are too high. You can't dodge, only sometimes and the qte is too quickly, crooked, you can't push the enemy away or kick him, and you can't run away because you're too slow and take damage, you can only parry some attacks sometimes, when an enemy grabs you you take damage. That is, you cannot do basic actions and you are too slow. A real person moves faster. And so the battle feels very poor, stupid and not natural. And for half the game you have to break boxes and collect cartridges. Read the notes. This is very stupid. Stupid inventory, crafting, selling items, this is very off topic. There is NG+ but you will still collect cartridges, there is no opportunity, like in the Village, to purchase endless cartridges for earned points, there is no opportunity to enjoy the machine gun. The challenges are inadequate, it is impossible to open many skins and other bonuses. One very big disadvantage in this game is that when the enemy is close and you aim point-blank at him, the bullets don’t hit him, bullets fly past the target. This is one of the dumbest and most unrealistic moments in the game. The helicopter with Mike is buggy. He has various bugs, for example he shoots at Leon, this is his most repeated bug. When a killed zombie transforms, it is not affected by ammo, this is not an honest loss of ammo. Ashley doesn't run after Leon, she's stay, I replayed a lot of times because of this bug, especially on more difficult difficulty, and she's very slow, even more than Leon that very slow too. The alt tab thing doesn't work well. But recording good with nvidia. DLC with Ada is better than the base game. More dynamic, various with RE2 scenes, episodes but without the RE2 maze style, the meticulous game process, it's very good. Unfortunately RE series, it is a meticulous, very stupid inventory, I have already written about the rest. I especially want to repeat about the very high-quality control, downright narcotic, but at the same time very meticulous and unrealistic. But I should conclude the review by saying that, yes, the developers should have gone a little further so that on high difficulty the game would be realistic, and not stupid and meticulous but such a game is very rare, it is the best RE, I have completed it many times, although it came out recently, and I will play it many more times, a very valuable game, story and action, as well as a gaming achievement. There is a new game+, without which I would not have completed the game so many times, the routine of shopping and crafting gets boring. You can have fun with the endless rocket launcher and thereby renew interest. The game has a very high quality selection of characters, sound, physics, atmosphere, everything is very high quality and harmonious.

Despite that, it still has plenty on offer for new and old players.

The remake's gameplay is overall faster and smoother while still having subtle tank controls as to not deviate from the original's gameplay too much. I recommend playing on hardcore for your first playthrough unless you're new to action games in general, as it gives a sense of barely surviving by the skin of your teeth with each encounter.

This game is the sickest gaming experience in a decade. Absolute torture to play as is. I do not say this lightly. I've S-ranked RE2 Remake, RE3 Remake, Village, and 7, and played the likes of Zone of the Enders, Warframe, or even Doom without any trouble, but not this one. Not even dimenhydrinate will help you. If you've ever experienced motion sickness when playing a game and are not willing to mod this game to make it playable at any length of time, absolutely DO NOT buy this game. Even after modding, you will still feel really sick after an hour or so. Some low-IQ at CAPCOM decided to add camera motion delay that contradicts the motion of your character and controls. Leon jolts to a stop after running, but the camera does not. Leon stops. Camera still moves forward. Then camera stops, and jolt back to its relative same position behind Leon. 4 jolts in total per one stop. 5 minutes in and you WILL feel the nausea like you've never experienced.

Free-roaming boat sequence has really counter-intuitive controls, resulting in an even queasier sequence than on-foot sequence. I've decided mid-game that this game is not a game I will ever replay after finishing. It is horrifying and not the way a horror game should be.

This game is a good game. Don't get me wrong. Sections are condense without losing the original flavors in terms of action. BUT all options available in the game as suggested by the game are NOT enough to fix the motion sickness. The field of view option is not wide enough, resulting in these jolts to be IN-YO-FACE. I had to mod this game to make it playable at reasonable length of time and it requires field of view as wide as 150, which is not an option. Some can settle at 130, but not me, but none of these options ARE NOT available in conventional version. It caps at 110. Any more MUST be modded in only.

If you are not willing to mod this game to help with your motion sickness, this game IS NOT FOR YOU. STAY AWAY.

CAPCOM is going to add DRM to make it unmoddable. This game is UNPLAYABLE WITHOUT MOD.

DO. NOT. BUY. IF. YOU. ARE. MOTION. SICK.

First of all I had rather low expectations because I like resident evil zombie games and this is not a zombie game and I knew it. But I had to give it a try and turned out there were more things I didn't like about this game:
1) Backtracking is far inferior compared to re2 remake where you can search almost all the game areas  throughout whole playthrough. Here many areas are blocked out too soon without warning.
2) Lyon is doing everything kind of slow and heavy. Controls are really unresponsive (compared to recent re2 and re3 remakes) Lyon is turning too slow, reloading weapons too long (even with maxed out upgrades it seems so long) and just won't open inventory for a year after any stun.
3) It doesn't help that the game is more action oriented and these issues only make pacing undesirably slower. Moreover there are other things that slower the pace. For example bear traps are here for no reason. They don't really make the fights more intensive but rather make you move less (again slower pacing). And after fights are over I'd keep watching how Lyon pulls his leg out of bear traps (again slower pacing).
4) I don't like this outdated inventory design of a suitcase (generally everything they changed from re2 remake was for worse). Also it was inconvenient to use with mouse and keyboard because mouse takes away the cursor control if moved. So I was constantly putting my hand away from the mouse when using inventory.
5) Enemies are kind of annoying. They almost do no damage (I played on standard difficulty) but instead everything staggers you. So fights are mostly dodging and watching some stun animations. It worked cool in re2 remake because it was a zombie game and you weren't supposed to engage into massive battles. But re4 is more of an action oriented game but still they make you watch every hit, every catch and so on.

Overall I didn't like that the game felt slow and kind of annoying difficult because of some arguable game mechanics. But the game itself instead is kind of too easy (especially boss fights).

Among the things I liked are:
1) Puzzles are quite entertaining
2) Some enemies are cool. For example Verdugo (the guy you can freeze) and Regenerador. (constantly regenerating dudes) The parts where you face these enemies are the best parts of the game (maybe because they feel more like resident evil with zombies).

I personally would give this game 5-6 / 10 (didn't get resident evil like experience) but I think objectively the game is made very well and deserves 8-9 / 10.

I am not a game developer/publisher, but if I was, I wouldn't add trash software like DRM and Enigma to my game(s). Adding these is counterproductive to why they were created; to prevent piracy. Adding these actually incentivizes pirating games so people don't have to have these (sorta) shady programs on their device making the game perform worse.

I don't pirate games and WILL NEVER pirate games, but I suppose I can understand why some feel the need to do so.

Of course you don't ""own"" anything you buy; you are allowed access to it which can be revoked at anytime for any reason. The real owners are however allowed to change their product as they see fit. Be it sneaking in DRM, MTX, Anti-cheat, Always Online, etc into their game post-launch, as we have seen a couple of other titles do before.
And next up on this worryingly long ""anti-consumer actions done by games' company"" list, we have CAPCOM. Attempting to sneak in a DRM into 11 year old titles breaking mod compatibility with it, as well as introducing performance issues and stuttering as commented by other users.

Apparently there was a ""bug"" with the Enigma software and it has been withdrawn for now, however they threaten with bringing an optimized version back at a later unannounced date.
If you care at all about consumer freedom, you need to help the community with kicking up a shit-storm so that these ideas don't proliferate anymore than they already have. You paid for these single player experiences, why should they take away your right to play them the way you want to.

This review will not change to positive. It will be my personal reminder of that time CAPCOM tried this really stupid thing.

IMO, yes, quite easily better. but is it perfect as some reviews would say? no. its not perfect. i flt RE2's remake was far closer to the perfect mark than this game could ever be. that said, its still a good game with a fair bt of replay value in it with The Mercenaries and Separate Ways.  

The good? the graphics are obviously incredible, the weapons are pretty great and fun to upgrade and tinker with, and there are more weapons this time around. the story is the same corny mid 2000s one its always been, which isnt a bad thing by any means. its still far better than a lot of game stories written today, which really goes to show how bad the writing is these days. some elements from original were changed, but nothing was drastically changed.  voiceover work is well done, though i will admit i much prefer the original merchant voice over the new one who sounds like the same guy that played Kano in MK 11 with his fake cheesy Australian accent. 

The bad? while the controls certainly got a massive upgrade in being modernized, Leon still feels much too slow, dodge button prombts dont always register and you take a hit that never shouldve landed, and in Professional mode thats pretty much a death added that shouldnt have been due to clunky and unresponsive controls. the game is full of bullet sponges, and it really ruins the flow imo. this is painfully evident when you go into a major gun fight (house defense in the village for example) with 3 bullets, and each enemy takes about 10 bullets and most have the parasite pop out for another 10 bullets to drop. then the elites showup and its about 10 bullets to stagger another 10 to stagger again and possibly kill with another 10. with a maxed out red9(yes it returns) in proessional.

overall, is it overhyped? i dont think so, its a great game thats good fun with only a few drawbacks that imo majorly outshines the original.",1705290175,1705290175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Going into this after the fail that was RE Village I had low expectations but damn the game surprised me by being one of the best RE games ever! (and that coming from someone who liked but never favored the original RE4)

+ Does literally everything way better then the original (+ few sections that are like in the original)! Darker and scarier overall, has few pure action moments that fit great with the rest of the game that is very nicely balanced in action vs horror, personally wish it favored horror a bit but that just me! Has very little cut content that you won't even miss as the rest of the game was done so damn amazing (whether it was ""new"" stuff in old areas or old areas being redone so darn great!)
+ All boss fights are amazing and way better then in the original specially the Krauser and Ramon fights WOW!
+ Great puzzles!!
+ BIG PLUS! The game is long like really long in the best way! Would have loved it if it were longer ofc but its def one of the longest RE games to date (mby even the longest)
+ RE Engine = Amazing graphics
+ Amazing story & chars (mostly like the original with some great improvements)
+ Great difficulty (done as amazing as the RE2 Remake difficulty)! 1st playthrough on Hardcore feels perfect (def though which it should be)! Can't wait to start a new game on hardest difficulty!
+ Unlike RE Village this game has a lot of night time and dark sections (I was rly scared they would just put the whole game in sunlight, very well lit castle and ultra bright island which luckily they didn't do!)

Honestly game is so good I won't even say ""separate ways"" being paid dlc is a big con.

Top 3 RE games to date! Srsly I'd much rather have a new RE every 2-3 years with the Team behind the RE2/4 remakes and RE7 then have them coming out yearly meaning that some will be perfections and some will be horrible like RE Village (honestly RE Village is good but it could have been sooooo much better and longer I just start hating its wasted potential..)

RE Village ruined my trust and faith in RE games and is the main reason I never preordered or bought this at full price but RE4 RE def restored my faith and trust making me wish for a great RE9, Code Veronica & RE6 remakes (RE6 remake if done right could be the best game in the series, provided its campaigns in gameplay/horror are like the RE2/3/4 remakes)!

You should be aware that there is likely a huge negative PR storm coming your way and possibly offer Capcom advice on how to implement your product properly as you've angered a lot of people.

[h1]Vorgeschichte:[/h1]
Schon das Original habe ich geliebt, rauf und runter gespielt, so wie mehrmals durchgespielt. Ich hatte alles freigeschaltet, da mich das Game schon damals total fasziniert hat. Dementsprechend waren meine Erwartungen und auch Ängste dem Remake entgegen groß. Eines der größten Probleme bei den meisten Remakes ist es, die Nostalgie Gefühle von damals mit in das Remake einfließen zu lassen, die alten Schwächen zu verbessern und im besten Fall kein 1:1 Remake zu erschaffen und neue Dinge mit einzubinden.

Das RE2 Remake hat schon gezeigt, wie gut Capcom dies meistert. Das RE3 Remake hingegen hatte seine Probleme. Deshalb war ich mir nie hundertprozentig sicher, dass sie das RE4 hinbekommen. Die Aufgabe ist eine sehr große und ebenso schwierige, die Wahrscheinlichkeit, alles richtig für die Fans zu machen, sehr gering. 

[h1]Hat Capcom die Aufgabe erfüllt?[/h1]
Selten fällt es mir eine derartige Frage so eindeutig positiv zu bejahen! Von Minute eins an war ich in meine Vergangenheit zurück gereist und spielte das Original erneut durch. Bis auf die Eröffnungssequenz ist der Start sehr nah dem Original treu geblieben. Oder doch nicht? Der Ablauf ist sehr ähnlich, aber die Szenerie und Atmosphäre eine andere, dennoch die gleiche. Das wirkt sehr widersprüchlich, aber genau so fühlt es sich an. Um etwas genauer zu beschreiben: Die Atmosphäre wirkt moderner und etwas dunkler, so wie angespannter als im Original. Aber so hat es sich damals auch angefühlt. Wenn man heute das Original spielt, merkt man doch die Unterschiede zum Remake, aber im Kopf ist es gleich. Besser kann ich's nicht beschreiben, aber ich denke, wer beide Spiele gespielt hat, wird verstehen können, was ich meine. Das Gefühl der Nostalgie zieht sich durch das gesamte Spiel, an den 1:1 identisch gestalteten Schauplätzen, aber auch an den komplett neu gestalteten Bereichen

[h1]Die Story[/h1]
Hier hat Capcom einen neuen Ansatz gewählt, der mir sehr gut gefallen hat. Der Ton ist sehr viel ernster als im Original, dennoch wurde der Scharm von damals berücksichtigt und mit eingefangen. Die Charaktere sind im Grunde sehr ähnlich dem Original, nur wirken sie besser durchdacht. Mehr möchte ich nicht verraten und lass euch den Spaß.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Dieses Gameplay ist einfach göttlich. Es ist perfekt für das, was es sein soll. Es spielt sich genau wie das Original, nur modernisiert. Selten fühlt sich ein Remake so gut an. Alle Gameplay-Elemente von damals sind inbegriffen, viel Neues kam nicht hinzu. Das bedeutet, es ist fast das gleiche Gameplay wie vor 20 Jahren und es fühlt sich dennoch neu und frisch an. Du kannst nun Angriffe parieren, so wie ausweichen.Die Waffen haben ein saftiges Feedback. Der Nahkampf ist sehr ähnlich wie damals und es gibt zum Glück gar keine Quicktime-Events mehr. 

Die einzelnen Kapitel haben, genauso wie früher, ihre herausfordernden Momente. An manchen Stellen hat mich das Game positiv genervt, es ist halt wie damals, obwohl es neue Umgebungen sind. Capcom hat es geschafft, neu und alt perfekt miteinander zu verschmelzen und etwas Neu-Altes zu erschaffen. Ich kanns nicht anders beschrieben^^

[h1]Die Technik und Grafik[/h1]
Nun bei mir läuft das Spiel sehr smooth und fühlt sich sehr gut an. Hin und wieder waren kleine Lags, aber nur nach Zwischensequenzen oder nach einem Ladebildschirm. Die Grafik-Einstellungen sind bei mir maximiert und ich spiele mit Raytracing, so wie mit DLLS, bei einer Auflösung von QHD. Mein System schreibe ich unten hin.

Bis auf das Wasser, welches ich wirklich alles andere als schön finde, gefällt mir die Grafik sehr gut. Die Texturen sind scharf, die Kanten glatt und die Farben/ Lichteffekte sehr satt. Die Charaktere sind sehr liebevoll und detailreich gestaltet, ebenso die Level bzw. Spielwelt.

Die Sounds sind ebenfalls sehr schön. Sie wurden komplett neu erstellt, aber natürlich an dem Original orientiert. Die deutsche Synchro gefällt mir auch sehr gut. Jeder Sprecher macht seine Arbeit ordentlich und glaubwürdig. Die englische Synchro habe ich nicht gehört.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]
RE4 Remake ist perfekt! Und das sage ich eigentlich nie. Ich hatte schon lange nicht mehr so viel Spaß mit einem Triple A Game!

Just to be clear, the originals aren't perfect games, the games have been showing their age for many years, and are filled with their own weird or even outright bad development decisions being made, but at least it was original then.

BUT:

1/ It's RE 2R core gameplay, meaning you completely lose the surgical precision of the OG RE 4. And it felt very off for the first 2 hours of playing or so (when you know the original, that is). Your character is much heavier, has inertia, the aiming is much less accurate… I tend to think that what worked very well for RE 2R didn't have to be transfered that bluntly to RE 4. Especially when RE 4 is a game known precisely for its top-notch gameplay.

2/ Again, if you know the original, do not expect to be as struck as in 2005. It's pretty much the same situations and the same pace. There's nothing very original compared to the OG version, they didn't triple down on the first chainsaw guy in the village or something over-the-top like that, for example. Similarly, there is no ""Lisa Trevor moment"" if you know what I mean.
It's the same game, with environments that are MORE generic, a not-always-for-the-best altered gameplay and… amazing graphics (the character models are STUNNING).

All in all you lose the arcade feel of the original for a more classic modern shooter. Again, it's good but… it leaves a bit to be desired I guess. And yet, the foundations of the game are so solid, you can't really go wrong with this one.

This is one of the best remakes I've ever played. As a younger man, I could never get into the original because I didn't really care for the horror elements, grim aesthetic, scarce resources, or stiff controls. But after playing this, I now appreciate the horror, aesthetic, and resource management. I could've probably gotten over the controls back then, but now I don't have to because they feel very good in the remake. 

[h2]Story[/h2]

The story is quite good. The quality of writing isn't quite on the level of The Last of Us or God of War, but it sits neatly on a level with the Uncharted games. Likable characters, in a slightly over the top action movie with some tongue-in-cheek cheesy moments. The character interactions are great. I was very connected to Leon, Ashley, and one other character I won't mention to avoid spoilers. 

[h2]Graphics[/h2]

The visuals are stunning. They did a great job of preserving the feel of the original, while updating everything and making it feel very modern. Some of the set pieces are brilliantly beautiful, and all the models are detailed and full of personality. It's one of the better looking games from 2023. 

[h2]Audio[/h2]

Audio design is impeccable. The music is mostly subtle and atmospheric, but all the weapon sound effects, dialogue, and atmospheric effects are very immersive. 

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

The gunplay feels INCREDIBLY good. Hitting headshots with the scope or laser sight is fantastic. Combat arenas are very well designed, leaving you a lot of options to engage with. Exploration is rewarding, allowing you to upgrade your tools and discover secrets. Backtracking is minimal, and unlocking things with items you get later is easy given the well designed map. 

[h2]Technical[/h2]

This game doesn't take up too much harddrive space and it's very well optimized. I was getting a solid ~100 frames on the highest settings in 3440x1440 with my 8700k and RTX 3080

[h2]Overall[/h2]

I would highly recommend this game to anyone. The pacing is good, the game respects your time, and the campaign isn't too long. The world is gorgeous and immersive, and the gunplay feels amazing. I'm now playing through the other Resident Evil games. Consider me a fan.

Game itself is phenomenal, did the OG Justice, and I recommend the actual game itself, however, I do not recommend Capcom as a Company, as they just added DRM to a long list of their games new and old that destroys performance, tries to stop anyone from being able to enjoy community made mods and custom content (Which they have some of the most popular modding communities ever), and straight up  makes their games fully unplayable for a large number of people.

The Nintendo comparisons Capcom gets are stronger than ever, countless beloved series with very high quality games but some of the most egregious and disgusting anti consumer practices around.

Apparently they may be reversing this or something hastily, and claiming it was an accident ""oopsies"" style, but lets be serious, we all know they intended this, and would only be backtracking due to backlash and to try and pretend nothing happened, they will try this again later, which is why we need to make a statement and let them know what their community thinks of this decision they made and that it could very well be a massive blow to themselves that could potentially damage their reception and popularity and future sales.made and that it could very well be a massive blow to themselves that could potentially damage their reception and popularity and future sales.

First I'll cover everything that was done differently that I don't like and why the game designers probably did it:
1. The knife durability. The original game had no durability for the knife. On top of that the knife never took any inventory space and you never needed to repair or replace it. They added the durability system because you can now instantly kill any enemy using stealth with the knife, as well as parry attacks and thrown weapons. Without a durability system the knife would probably be overpowered and break the game.
2. Stealth. There was no stealth (not really) in the original game. Any game that adds it usually does so because it's cool even if it's unnecessary. And it's completely unnecessary in this game as it's just faster and easier to kill enemies with your guns. You might be able to save a little bit of ammo but it's not viable enough to make it noticeable.
3. Ammo crafting. This wasn't in the original game at all and seems like a carry over from RE 2. It sort of makes sense as you can choose which ammo to make as you need it but all it really ends up doing is sitting in your inventory taking up space... one slot for ten gunpowder, two slots for EACH small resource, and three slots for EACH large... So be prepared to stack trash in your inventory *just in case* you need specific ammo.
4. Weapon upgrades are more expensive and treasures are more proliferate. Why do this? To make running through each level to collect treasures take more time. This adds padding to the game play but doesn't offer anything of value. This becomes even more annoying if you add in the extra treasures DLC which is only there to pad Capcom's pockets.
5. Spinels as a second currency. An annoying way to pad the game more by forcing the player to complete challenges to earn specific items. One currency is enough.
6. Aiming now includes the ""wait for accuracy"" mechanic of RE 2 as well as having the gun sway from the original RE 4. The gun sway isn't as bad as the original, but it's still there.
What's good about the Remake?
1. The knife system for parrying and killing enemies was excellently done. I can't help but think that with a little fine tuning they could have done away with the durability and trash knives by making the knife less OP but still more useful than the original.
2. NO QTEs. Absolutely the best part of this is the fact that the QTEs are gone. I loved using the knife parry during fights instead of seeing an annoying button prompt over a cutscene.
3. The story and levels have been shuffled for a fresh take on the original game with plenty of surprises and more likable characters (Louis and Ashley).
Would I recommend it? Not really, no. Especially with the DRM changes coming down the pipe. It's a single player game (mostly) so adding DRM is ridiculous.
Do I think it deserves the ridiculous amount of praise that it got? No, not really.",1705092888,1705093011,False,9,0,0.504341840744018555,0,True,False,False

- 10-15 drop in FPS with stuttering
- Various virus and Malware flags showing up, this DRM is coming out of Moscow btw

Its not just Resident Evil but all capcom titles, and while there are lists out there that tell you what games have it capcom will sneakily slip it in without you knowing. so please do the right thing and just sail the seven seas cause as Gabe Newell put it ""piracy isn't a pricing problem, its a service problem"" and the service were receiving is less than poor given a pirated copy can run the game better than a legit copy.
And and D riders that comment trying to defend this then you better show some proof with your statement otherwise im not going to give you the time and day.

Below is my old review from when i played it and gave it a few weeks for the launch hype to die down

[h1]Old Recommended review[/h1]
Well I'm glad i held off on writing my review as quick reviews tend to only focus on their first impressions so with mine i wanted to dive into the whole picture of this Remake telling you why you should play this but to not get your hopes up or to be blinded by nostalgia.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
While you'd assume i'd say the game half-asses it compared to the original, that's not the case here. The Remake captures a lot of the original in terms of scenes and events while changing it up a bit to keep veteran players on their toes.

One of the biggest improvements to this would have to be the combat/encounters as enemies can easily swarm you if not at times outright spawn in behind you to give that feeling of being surrounded by a bunch of Spanish denizens out to kill you in the name of their lord and savior.

Being able to stealth kill a ganado or outright go full John Wick on a group of them just leaves you feeling a special type of satisfaction to be desired all the time. Parrying an enemy's attack while being low on health giving you that stroke of luck to survive feels great.

The new puzzles and even the extended Ashley section was nice to play through as it expanded a somewhat short section from the Original version and the village layout stayed the same while shuffling the rooms connecting to them to give a familiar yet different feeling. Moving on to the castle it does feel a bit more touched up from the original in terms of graphical quality as can be said about everything in this game.

I did like the improvement to Salazars boss fight both making him mobile and having him and Leon exchange their lines mid fight.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
I wont lie when i say that while the castle looks better in terms of looks it definitely took a fall from design as it's no longer a death trap filled fun house (at least for Salazar it was a fun house) and even the man of the castle Ramon Salazar and even all the main baddies of the game have minimal screen time, Salazar in the original would constantly taunt you over the radio with him and Leon exchanging lines back to one another in a cheesy fashion.

The game definitely feels a bit more linear than the original as it'll be like 5 chapters before you back track to a spot you missed something and while the original was linear in terms of progression there were moments where you could backtrack mainly for a merchant who while I like his quips he gives when you see him I feel there's never a moment  where i had to backtrack to him aside from finding a gem to socket into a treasure.

Separate Ways/Another Order was rumored but so far nothing has been shown for it or even hinted at it aside from a folder found in the games files and mystery achievements that the fanbase has tied to it being potential DLC.

Much like the other Remakes this game would fall into the challenge run type of game as thats the most you'll get out of replaying it aside from achievement hunters.

Another issue with at least the PC version is the lack of a VR mode for both this and RE:VIII as its exclusive to PS5 with no promise of it coming to PC much like 7 did. The only legit way to playing RE4 in VR is either buying a PS5 and PSVR2 AND the game, or buying a quest 2 and buying RE4VR.

Mercenaries mode felt too easy to get that S rank and the leader boards are crap as you'll spend hours just trying to get out of the 10,000 place mark and of course the lack of challenges as it literally only serves to be fan service with its own twist and having Luis added in as a playable character. Meanwhile RE4VR actually had challenge missions included in it's Mercenaries update and the same can be said for Mercenaries Additional Orders in Village. I'm not saying Mercenaries is outright bad but it is lacking those extra additions prior games added to theirs.

[spoiler]No U-3 (it) really throws things off as he would of made a good mid boss for the island shortly after Ashley is recaptured or at least before rescuing her making U-3 being the keyholder to the cell or something. though this is remedied by the fact this boss might reappear in the Separate ways DLC if that even comes.[/spoiler]

[h1]Concluding Thoughts[/h1]
I think this game should be played but not with rose tinted glasses as your love for the original will turn your experience with this into a sour one, it's okay to admire the changes as most people did at first and thats what the devs intended to do for players and it's to give them a fresh yet familiar experience.

Honestly if you're just getting into RE and you played the Remakes and not the original then none of these changes will probably bother you.
If you're one who fancied the original games and didn't like this from its changes then just take into consideration that the remakes are more like Re-imaginings of the story and applying the OG timeline to the Remake timeline will lead to inconsistencies.

So without further ado id say get this while its on sale unless you have the extra cash then by all means snag this up for your collection and if you already played this and not the UHD version then definitely check that out as well.",1690944041,1705071631,False,0,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

Just for releasing a game that doesn't have any major performance/technical issues, I'm already happy. 
But Capcom went and made an INCREDIBLE game. Already played over 50 hours (15h on first playtrough) and I don't see myself stopping until I get all challenges.
RE4 has great content, graphics and gameplay. 
Story is still not the best, just like the original, but it did expand a bit on it, via videos or readable in-game files.

While I'm more of a fan of true survival horror (like REmake), as far as action focused RE titles go, this is the best one by far. Zero regrets getting this on day one.

It's not a perfect game, and no game is, but it's a damn good one.

For the few things I can complain, that doesn't really outshine the good parts, no Assigment Ada/Separate Ways, Superultrawide has some issues (solved by using a cheat engine table to increase FOV) and, like many people, I also hated Ada new VA.

(But if you go to the actress social media to bully her for the performance you are a total loser)

What a game, what an adventure. It took me awhile to complete only due to life circumstances. However, I can say that with this being my very first dip into the Resident Evil franchise that it was an excellent one. I loved the combat system and how it flows, the difficulty is fair at standard and all the enemy types have unique weaknesses you can overcome with any weapons. Often I found myself relying on only handgun ammo and being thankful for only a handful more rounds. The game itself does a very good job of balancing tension, horror, and action in a way I've rarely felt in any other game. 

If you're looking for a good game to sink your teeth into that is challenging, fun, engaging, and spooky then this is the game for you. Although this game hinges around action, there are a couple of set piece moments in the game where the horror drips and you can feel tense throughout it.

It takes all the elements that made Resident Evil 4 iconic for a lot of us, and added a fresh coat of paint on top. 

I love how the game went from having a comedic vibe with its original release, only for it to become an immersive, deep storyline that keeps you entertained with its remake. The story [b]feels[/b] like an actual story - it feels like there's impact, it feels like there's depth, and it feels like there's consequences. Certain characters had more added to their stories, only adding to the cinematic feelings you get from this game's playthrough.

The graphics are beyond beautiful, and the addition of fun, interactive mechanics is a welcome addition that I didn't expect to see (as someone that didn't play any of the other remakes, apparently those mechanics are present there too!) but they only amplified the overall gameplay experience as someone that likes to have a lot of control over the actions I do ingame.

The only real downside (in my opinion) is the lack of QTEs (Quick Time Events) that were narrowed down to being able to parry enemy attacks and the occasional one-button dodge you have to perform. I was disappointed to see that I can't mash buttons ferociously to outrun a boulder! Is this really a downside? It depends on who you ask, but I can understand why this part of the game was left out for a more casual, laidback gameplay loop.

All in all? 10/10 remake. I highly, highly, highly recommend it to anyone that's looking to buy this game. Do it. You won't regret it, I sure as hell didn't. <3

Just about every area I wanted to revisit with the newer combat is present, and yet it manages to keep its own identity as well. The more serious tone works surprisingly well, and I love how Leon and Ashley talk to each other throughout the game this time.

There are a few things that are kinda dog ass though. The villains are really, really lame in this remake. They get no screen time and have little to no personality. There are side quests that get repetitive near the end as well. Did you like shooting those medallions for the Punisher in the OG? Well get ready to do that in every major area of the game.

And lastly, the music. And by that, I mean what fucking music? WHERE IS IT!? RE 4 (2005) has such an iconic atmospheric soundtrack and 90% of the remake is silence. What gives? I get it's more horror focused this time around, but y'know what, so's The Thing and I want to mainline that sexy synth beat straight into my arteries.

Oh, also Ada and Krauser's VA's are pretty bad. Yeah. 8/10.

+ The treasure hunt is better than in the original.
+ The village area is bigger than the original one.
+ Enemies feel more aggressive.
+ You can either sneak or go straight guns blazing  gives the game many different opportunities.
+ The story is deeper, but the characters are not as good as in the original.

Things I Hate.
- The game's shooting mechanics are the same as Re2 remake, which is a really bad move by Capcom because Re4 is a fast-paced action game.
- Enemies sometimes have strange magnet hands and grab you from far away.
- Leon moves slowly, sometimes it feels like the game's camera is confusing its own, especially with the mouse and keyboard.
- The characters and voice acting are terrible, except Luis is ok even though he looks like a drug addict.

In the end, the game was entertaining to go through with hardcore and new game Pro. But it's definitely not a game worth 70 euros. I give the game 6/10.
I feel like Capcom is going to get worse with these Resident Evil remake game mechanics. Weird but shitty Re3 Remake has better mechanics than this one.

Now that I've achieved that goal, I think maybe the real treasure was the experience I gained along the way.

I like the bigger inventory space compared to RE2RE, especially in that plot crucial items weren't counted in inventory. There are pretty good YouTube guides to getting good completion times, and I recommend watching several so you can pick and choose the best tactics for you.

It was an ambitious, horror-action B-movie that's pace never let up through over-the-top cut-scenes, memorable set pieces, and creative combat encounters. So when the remake was announced, I (like many others) was scratching my head as to how they could remake something that was already so playable.

I'm happy to report that they did it justice.

The tone is much less campy but retains much of the original spirit. It's still weird. The Merchant is still mysterious. Leon still cracks one-liners and does acrobatic roundhouse kicks. But the characters have more depth and clearer motivations. Luis specifically is a highlight.

The set pieces are just as memorable. It's missing a few boss fights, but the cuts feel like they were made with serious consideration. And for the encounters that do return, there's been a lot done that will subvert or surprise the people that played the original.

Most importantly, this game has the best combat in any video game I have ever played. Capcom has this game tuned where you feel like an action hero who's always on his last bullet. Movement is vastly improved from the original's statuesque combat system, and the enemies have been adjusted to account for it. Every weapon packs an appropriately satisfying wallop, and the upgrades and progression feel meaningful in a way that encourages experimentation and future playthroughs. I'm honestly just thinking about getting back to play more.

Importantly, the original is still widely available on literally any modern platform. So even if there are a few changes here and there that I didn't prefer, I could always go back. This is the only remake that I feel stands next to the original rather than attempt to bury it.

This is one I will come back to for years to come. Please please please play this game.",1704513353,1704858625,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The original RE4 was clearly the point in the series when RE games became more fast paced horror shooters and less slow paced survival horror games, until RE7 reversed that trend. Resident Evil 4 Remake is an action packed 3rd person horror shooter with great visuals and many very well polished set pieces. The story is silly and makes little sense, but that's to be expected. At least all the crazy characters keep things interesting.
From a purely gameplay focused point of view I actually would rate RE4 Remake below the other Remakes and also below RE7 and RE8. It's still a great game though, despite some gameplay flaws that become more obvious the further you progress. RE4 Remake constantly throws hordes of enemies at you and half of the time it feels like they respawn infinitely. Especially in the later chapters just running past the hordes seems to be the best tactic and while running past enemies and ignoring them was always part of classic survival horror it just feels unintentional and wrong in a game that is so combat focused. In my opinion they should have toned down the number of enemies a few notches and also the number of respawns so that strategically fighting them to clear an area feels rewarding and not like a chore. There are clearly chapters were it becomes more annoying then challenging (although this is a very hard game). Escorting Ashley through what feels like 70% of the game is also a flaw in my opinion. Protecting her can get annoying quickly because you cant really do much to keep her out of the close quarter action.
Overall its still a very good game and a must play for all RE fans and fans of 3rd person shooters in general.",1704730611,1704829656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately I cannt say I own this game on multiple consoles, but I have beaten it on ps4 and pc, and gotten every achievement except dlc, and I beaten it on professional. I have enjoyed this game thoroughly, and it is a masterpiece. I want to compare it to the original Resident evil 4 by itself, but that wouldn't be a good review. This remake is a 2023 video game, and it has to be compared not to only the game it is remaking, but whether it is good compared to the games it is released in its time. The point is to see whether the remake is jsutified according to the 80$ price tag in a sea of other games in its category. In this way, I would contend that Resident Evil 4 is a worthy nominator for 2023 game of the year.

Firstly, the game does update that old game design to a more modern sensibilities. This means you can walk and shoot and you can auto-sort your attache case, which are nice additions, but the game does far more with it's combat. It basically remakes that old game combat to more in line of what a expert actually plays like. If you play that old game long enough, you start to be more aggressive and tactful, and turn this horror game into an action game, but one that has tank controls.  It is like if you were playing Doom, but with tank controls. In the remake, you can move freely and enemies are more aggressive, allowing that play style to come more naturally.  The perfect mode that exemplifies this play style is mercenaries mode, which shows what this combat system can do. The story mode still restricts you, so it's not like doom in it's insane action. It's a better blend of horror and action then the original had, which is a rarity in today comapre to other video games. If you want to play Spiderman 2, you could jsut play Batman Arkham games for a similar experience. If you want to play Resident Evil 4, you have to play Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 is stillone of the few games that blends action and horror together in a enjoyable way. 

As for the story, it's phenomenal. In nine hours, the game narrates a darker, unsettling, depressing, and hopeful story that has gripped my heart many times throughout.  It's a simple story, about a knight sent by the king to save the princess, and you might think that I am writting about a different game, but no we are stilll talking about Resident Evil 4. The story has  wonderful symbollism throughout, where the story is a modern day representation of those tales of knights. You have Leon, who is a agent (knight) sent by the president (King) to save his daughter (princess), and his tale of killing the monsters (las plagas). I won't spoil anything, but you definately leave the story feeling good and uplifted by the act of Heroism that Leon displays many times, which I quite franckly miss. I think it's a rather crude and dark time we live in when we're inundated with dark depressing stories, like Last of Us, where the protagonist commit flat out evil, and we're supposed to pretend that it's a ""serious story about the frailty of man"" or some other nonsense like that. One could say that it's meant to be a much more serious reflection of character study, but since we live in such selfish and turbulent times, where women will kill their own children, or men abandone their children because of personal reason, at what point does it cease to be ""character study""and an opportunity to say for ourselves, ""Well i guess it's ok to kill  someone for whom I love"". How much of it is it just us trying to justify great moral evil to make us, ""deep and complex"".  I appreciate a story like Resident Evil 4 where I'm moved by the ""simple"" virtuous hero overcoming the  ""deep and complex"" evil S.O.B's. It's an uplifting story that refreshes my soul after playing it.

If your thinking of buying it, please do. It's a fantastic game.

I own it on VR and the remastered version on PS4 with the original crappy graphics. To me this was the most unapproachable game on all formats due to it's difficulty. I retired from playing it quite early on out of frustration. I'm a skilled veteran of gaming, but not on par with someone that enjoys challenging souls like games. I like to run and gun John Wick style and don't have the patience for stealth or timed attacks.  I was afraid the remake version would have the same punishing gameplay and was excited to see that I could lower the difficulty and actually have a good time with this version of the game. I honestly steered away from any idea of purchasing RE4 again because of my past experiences, I'm glad I caved in. I really thought I'd be refunding it. I know I'm still early in at chapter 4 but I'm having a blast and recommend this game for gamers that might be afraid of picking up this title due to it's challenging reputation. It's definitely approachable for less skilled players.

After RE3 Remake, when Capcom announced that they were doing a remake for RE4, I was so happy; but at the same time, was scared that it would follow the path of RE3.
But believe me, while playing this masterpiece you won't think of RE3 anymore, and in my opinion, it was close enough to what we needed.

From the start, you'll notice that some places are changed and almost unrecognizable, but after playing for a few minutes, that old RE 4 shows itself within this game, but with almost real-life graphics!

here we have Capcom making you ready for the changes that you'll see further into the game. while showing you that they tried their best to be faithful. surely that has its ups and downs, but I can live with that.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1] is almost perfect; at first, I was worried that enemies were unreliable on being stunned when you shoot them in the face since sometimes it takes more than two hits for them to get stunned. But at the end of the game, there I was, blasting through them like a bunch of predictable insects. Sure, Leon's walking is a little heavy, but it doesn't make it any less fluid.
The map is fantastic, this was the first Resident Evil game in that I used its map more than 100+ times in one playthrough, and I was using it for gathering treasures and doing requests for HOURS!

Gunplay was great for me with all of the guns except with TMP, that gun will never shoot where you tell it to shoot, and I only used it 2 or 3 times when I was out of ammo on other guns, or I was trying to kill some nasty dogs with Nemesis-like teeth.

[h1]The story[/h1] was expended much more, and there was so much to find out about the plaga and Los Iluminados, the Salazar family, and the betrayal of Ramon. 
also finding out why Ada wants the sample or why Wesker needs it.
We get more information about Major Krauser and his operation with Leon. and even get to know more about our Madridan officer Louis Sera.
I think they're changing the whole story of Operation Javier, but it doesn't sound bad though.

[h1]Graphics[/h1] are at the peak! I'm not sure if ReEngine can make it further in this matter from here on forward; the lighting is so cool, and you'll appreciate that when playing as Ashley.
There were some rainy moments in a section of the village that made my fps cry in its bed, but I can't call that non-optimized, because It was so beautiful and I was playing on Ultra 4K so I expected some fps drops.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2953192782

[h1]Ashley[/h1]is GREAT Now! She's no more a loud screaming machine that can't even climb down a ladder, but instead, you'll be amazed by the amount of help that she provides to Leon; I started to like her from the church encounter, there is more soul put into her and that was the best change they've made in the remake.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951472683

[h1]Cons[/h1]
Some boss fights were changed a lot and even built new from the ground up, like [spoiler]Salazar[/spoiler] and I didn't like that.
Fight with Krauser wasn't like old times and the area felt so empty; they even changed [spoiler] Krauser's mutated hand[/spoiler] and it was much uglier than the original.

Some areas were a little bit smaller than the original, which was odd.

Merchant's voice was a downside; it felt like he was trying to mimic or even mock the original voice actor; I don't exactly know why, but It felt like I was talking to the duke from ReVillage. But Then I remembered that Duke didn't talk this much; even if he did, I didn't care.
But the merchant...ooh boy, he is so talkative now, Shut up already! I am trying to choose something to buy, don't give me that repetitive dialogue every second; 
and his dialogue doesn't always mean something; for example, he sometimes says he got some rare things on sale but I the stranger couldn't find anything in his pockets.
Speaking of pockets, the only good and funny thing he said was that I couldn't put that Rocket launcher in my pocket.

[h1]Overall[/h1] the game feels so much like the old RE4, and in some cases even better; the action is like John Wick killing a bunch of farmers, but at some points, the Horror is Unbearable! w8 until you encounter and try to defeat the first two Regeneradors while looking for that Biosensor Scope.

The BIG undeniable flaw of RE4 Remake, which cannot be completely ignored, is simplifying or removing several challenging situations that were present or more engaging in the original version, especially from the island.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Some video games are so good, that everyone should experience them at least once. When Resident Evil 4 was released in 2005, it was considered as such. The remake of Resident Evil 4 is a good reminder of this fact too.
Experience this Masterpiece at all costs!

Okay...so re4 remake is fun.  Exploration is a big improvement here with more places to check out and is easier to traverse without getting lost, new weapons are simpler to find/unlock, and there are plenty of side quests that are simple and reward you with points that you can use for upgrades and other useful items. The mini games are a lot fun, and it's nice to have the carry case inventory back from the og re4, as well as puzzles that are pretty fun to solve to advance. However, the combat is very inconsistent with weapon aim and dodge/parry reactions, you're stuck in whatever animation your doing until it finishes so you can't open your menu to heal on the fly, and guarding Ashley this time around is lot more of a hassle than it was in the og re4 where you could at least have her hide instead of just simply following you from a little further back where she still gets hit or captured anyways. Also, for some reason, they thought it was good idea to not let players store ammo in the storage box at save points, which is extremely dumb since it forces you to skip out on certain weapons or go through the tedious process of selling and then re-purchasing weapons along with their upgrades over, and over again just to meet certain situations. I'd still recommend this game, but only to players who have the patience to put up the short comings of this title.  All-in-all, still a pretty solid game worth a play-through or two, but quickly proved to be less fun than the original in terms of gameplay. 6/10


UPDATE.  I changed my mind.  The sheer amount of ass-pulls in the later half of the game drops this down to a 4/10.   The re-generators being able to turn into iron maidens despite destroying all the parasites in their body is an ass-pull, enemies being able to teleport to where Ashley is, is yet again, another ass-pull.  The 'team puzzles' in the later half only serve to waste time, and is it really too much for a special-forces trained operative to have steady aim or reflexes when in combat situations?  After this bit, I can not recommend this game.  Instead, go play Balder's Gate 3 or hell, even Starfield is more fun since it doesn't punish you for trying to have fun or solve problems by thinking outside of the box.  I want to love this game, but the more I play, the more issues and lazy programming I run into.  This is easily the weakest remake in the Resident Evil franchise.



FINAL UPDATE:  Okay, changed my mind again.  After beating the game, I can say that while the lousy gunplay, being easily stun-locked, and the ass-pull with the regenerators, the good outweighs the bad here.  The game is ultimately a good experience.  All of the boss fights are pretty good and offer a good challenge, most of the puzzles are satisfying to solve, the weapons feel balanced in terms of stats, allowing for various play styles.  The game still forces you to play by certain rules here and there, but after getting past the Island Base Boss, the gameplay improves again.  Characters are well written, the cutscenes look fantastic, and the story has good flow and makes more sense this around instead of the goofy (but still fun) story we got in the OG RE4.  I can admit I was wrong about this being a weak remake, it's actually on par with re2 remake in terms of overall quality.  Still not as good gameplay wise as the OG RE4, but I can comfortably give this entry a solid 8/10.",1704160697,1704678947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've had some fun playing the game, but what really just sours the experience is the horrid combat and movement. Movement wasn't a huge issue in RE2 2019 as the game was rather slow paced. Bosses would sometimes be annoying, but that was about it. In RE3 2020 you had the dodge, which trivialized actually trying to space out enemies. But for anyone who's played REsis will know that the movement just doesn't work with faster paced action. The movement in that game was a genuine hindrance to the gameplay.

In this game the whole kinetic-based movement system just doesn't work. It takes away from the fun of the game. But on top of the wonky-ass movement, you'll also have to deal with the completely insane decision of introducing an even worse mechanic to the combat. Aiming inaccuracy.
I have no clue whose idea it was to put horrible inaccuracy into a SHOOTER of all things. The way focusing works in this game is a huge downgrade from previous games, like RE7 or RE2. Even in RE7 the way focusing your reticle worked was better than this game, but RE7 was also, once again, a way slower game. Some totally incompetent lead designer thought it would be a great idea to make focusing worse in RE4, a game that's a shooter through and through.
Combat just isn't fun in this game. I played it as a survival game and I had my fun with it, but playing this game for the combat is a no-go. If you want good combat play the OG, play RE5, hell play RE6 mercs. All of those games have not only genuinely great combat, but with the latter two you also have coop which can be a ton of fun. This game not having at least coop for mercs is a shame.
Oh, and Ashley's AI sucks. Instead of follow/wait, now you have tight/loose formation. You can't tell her to chill anymore. Even in the tight formation she will often fail to properly stick to your back. You can abuse checkpoints or stupid enemy AI to better deal with the new system, but yeah, it sucks.

Besides the combat there isn't too much to say. Some things suck, some things are okay, some things are so-so. Krauser and Ada's EN voices are pretty horrible, but most other characters' VAs are okay. Mike's a G.
By far my two biggest issues with modern Capcom games though is the reliance on slathering EVERYTHING in yellow paint and trying to nickel and dime the customer.
Do yourself a favor and look for the No Yellow Paint mod. Install that shit ASAP. It works perfectly with the main game and the DLC is only missing a couple of models which still have the ugly yellow paint smeared all over them.
Regarding the extra monetization in this game, it's bad. The game itself is 60 bucks, but all the P2W (it is P2W, don't try to argue) DLCs are a whopping 69 (nice) Euro.
Two weapons are locked behind DLC, a pair of sunglasses which protect you from your own flashbangs (I think some of the shades you unlock in-game also have that effect?), a treasure map which'll add extra treasure (100-200 grand worth of treasure to sell), and around two dozen exclusive upgrade tickets which you can use to massively gain power in the early and mid game by either using it on certain weapons to increase the damage by 1.5x of base, or by selling each ticket for a staggering 80k. Oh, and 2 attache cases and 2 charms, those are also paid.
The reason this game doesn't have a $5 Unlock All Bonus Shop Items DLC is likely due to that. Why charge people $5 for everything in the bonus shop if you can charge them 7-10 bucks for 3-5 tickets. I have no doubt in my mind some people bought a dozen or even more tickets, just so they can get S+ way easier or brainlessly go through the game on the lower difficulties. Speaking of, the game isn't very difficult. Even on HC, given you upgrade your guns and buy stuff, it'll be pretty much a cakewalk. The OG was pretty easy too, even on Pro, but still, I expected more from this game.

Just play the OG. You can pick it up for next to no money and the HD Project is a substantial upgrade from the original textures and models. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, unless you can get it for like below $15, including Sep. Ways, which now is $10 on its own. Assignment Ada btw is still missing, and will likely never be added.
This game is a lot better than RE3/RE8, but it's still way below of what Capcom once was capable of. They're going hard on nostalgia and established IPs and aren't afraid of milking them dry. They also don't care about selling literal P2W DLC. They've been doing it since RE7, with the mainline titles. But each time it gets worse.

If you were living in Japan and bought the Japanese version of the base game, you can't access the DLC whatsoever without buying the entire game all over again. The region lock can be bypassed via steam console for those who own the International version of the base game and are now buying the DLC in Japan, but the same method doesn't work vice versa, because somehow owning the international version of the DLC doesn't provide you with a license to download the Japanese version from the steam console. There are no workarounds other than to buy the base game again.

However, comparing it to Resident Evil 2, I feel the game has somewhat stagnated in certain aspects. For instance, Resident Evil 4 didn't scare me as much regarding the fear factor. In Resident Evil 2, the constant pursuit by Mr. X, forcing you to hide or keep moving, creates genuine tension. This element was less pronounced in Resident Evil 4. There were a couple of moments where an unexpected monster appearance gave me a slight scare, but it wasn't as intense as in the second game. In Resident Evil 2, the dark locations filled me with dread, always fearing something might suddenly appear. But in the fourth game, it felt like simply shooting down enemies.

Speaking of shooting, the weaponry in Resident Evil 4 is excellent, but a downside is the abundance of ammunition. In Resident Evil 2, as you might recall, we had to conserve ammo as it was scarce, and every bullet was precious. This scarcity applied to other resources and health kits as well. In Resident Evil 4, this is not the case; ammo and health kits are plentiful. You can even buy cases to increase the chance of finding more ammo and kits, which I personally didn't appreciate.

Regarding the final part of the story, I wasn't impressed with the boss fight. It was almost the same as in Resident Evil 2, where you had to target the eyes to defeat the boss. The boat escape felt too simplistic and lacked intensity compared to the second part. The boat seemed almost toy-like, and I didn't feel the hardcore challenge I experienced in Resident Evil 2. As for the plot, I think it could have been shortened, as the last 2-3 hours of gameplay felt repetitive and boring. The recurring theme of either Ashley disappearing or being attacked, requiring a rescue, was boring. However, overall, the plot is interesting, and the graphics are of a good standard. The game doesn't drastically stagnate, but it has minor issues. Overall, I think it's a good game and recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the Resident Evil series.",1704636165,1704636165,True,10,2,0.594668328762054443,0,True,False,False

in true resident evil fashion the camera angles, ambiance and design of the game put you in situations that are truly frightening, even as a horror fan who has been generally desensitized to horror games and movies. on another note,
people often remark that leon is bad with women, largely using his dialogue with ashley as an example, but to me it's quite obvious that he's rejecting her advances in as polite a way as he can think of. my little baby meow meow would NEVER take advantage of a vulnerable girl in a terrifying situation. plus he's so hot every man woman and zombie is already throwing themselves at him crazy style. leon is the kind of man people get into hijinks to impress but it would never work because he only has eyes for ada, who pretty much treats him like her little man servant BUT that's what he loves about her. 
TLDR; i will keep replaying this game indefinitely and it's my favorite title in the RE main series by far. when it came out in 2005 it changed the course of gaming and inspired many other like style games that are highly rated and very well loved, and the remaster not only brought in a new wave of gamers to experience and love this game now almost 20 years later, but it cements this title as a true masterpiece in gaming, not even just in the RE series. i truly believe if BG3 didn't come out in the same year it could have very well won GOTY.",1704634198,1704634305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the unaware, RE4 is about as close to action as you can get while still being a survival horror game. You're usually very low on supplies and the game loves to break the rules and throw new things at you for it's entire duration. If you played RE8, this is certainly much more frightening than that.
Compared to vanilla RE4, there's some light ""remixing"" of when certain things happen and some sections are totally replaced with new content. There's also a few key moments I was hoping would come back better, but instead they were removed or moved to the paid DLC. There's a boss fight later in the game that's been heavily reworked for the better, but there's also one later in the game that's totally gone, for example. Most of the Metal Gear-esque radio calls are also gone. Other than that this is still a very good take on the original game's content.
Both the remake and the original are 5 out of 5 games. But I will say that if you don't mind some dated graphics, I would still recommend the original version over this one. If you'd rather not go that route, this will do it for you, but it feels more like something for people who have already experienced OG RE4 and wanted some fresh paint on it. Maybe not a GOTY contender, but still well worth the money.

Genuine dont understand how people say that this is such a great game. It's so frustrating to the point where it's not even fun. Some of the enemies are stupidly overpowered. On a good day, it's an 8 for me. On a bad day, a 2. It does some things extremely well and great, but other things are just shit. Most of the encounters are just stupidly annoying. For example, why the hell are there so many regenerators. They are just a waste of resources and you get locked up with them. It's so stupid.

> The reviewers of this game need to cope better. The parrying mechanic is bullshit on higher difficulties, it is not a good mechanic.

> While the story is more serious, it is not better/remastered. The sections of where you speak with Salazar or Saddler are missing, instead we got poor one way jabs from Salazar in the Castle. The body movement and general movement in cut scenes are not what they should be and are kinda static. You do not even see Saddler until like the last chapter... Who ever wrote the dialogue for Ada in this needs to be demoted, Ada sounds so dead and boring in this compared to Resident Evil 2 and the original, she is like a different character all together.

> Enemy stunning is broken and random unlike in the original, on Normal it is not really noticeable but on higher difficulties you could shoot a standard Cultist or Villager with a shotgun and it will not always stun them. Enemies are such bullet sponges in this with no knockback on higher difficulties it is insane.

> Ashley's AI is terrible, I do not know why they did this. You cannot make her stay in place anymore, instead you can tell her to stay back which is a sure way to get her attacked or get stuck on something. Ashley has no health bar now either which is dumb since any hit will simply knock her down making you have to go pick her up. In the original when damaged her speed simply was slower like it would be for Leon when hurt or it would simply kill her which is a much nicer system. Ashley can not be used to attract enemies anymore either which was useful in some instances in the original now. Not to mention her staying close is not really close either, she is so annoying in this compared to the original.

> Missing Content from the original story: second El Gigante fight in the Village, the lava room in the castle, second Prisoner fight in the cage during the castle segment, lift segment in the Village, only two sections compared to three where you fight the Novisadors not to mention they are easy as shit in this compared to the original, no Bulldozing section on the Island, the ""It"" boss fight is missing entirely. Probably missing several but these are the ones at the top of my head. Sure there are new ones now but they are generally nothing more than two sections from the original combined into one or re imaging of one.

Overhaul though it is a solid game but it is no masterpiece like the original was. Probably give it an 8/10. I would wait for it to be on sale if not bought yet.",1704351240,1704351240,True,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

The combat is good.
The genera shift from action horror to pulpy action with a little horror left over on repeated playthroughs is awesome.
The achievements are actually fun for the most part and add value to playing through this more then once.
The mercenaries is good.
Its ability to very expertly recreate the most memorable parts of the original is great.

Its definitely worth it on sale, and, if the last year hasn't been as hard on you as it has been for everyone else, it is probably worth it full stop.

I leave you with two pieces of advice.

1. Keep your start of chapter saves on your first playthrough, this will save you a lot of time later with the minimal amount of spoilers. Don't stress over anything miss-able, just play the game naturally.

2. Don't worry about seemingly pay to win microtransactions. You don't need them. The ones that aren't pay 2 win are fun, but feel free to ignore the ones that seem like a 2 dollar donation for power.
The games difficulty system is.... Weird, and will just automatically compensate for a lot of the power these DLC items give anyhow. The extra resources will just set off the dynamic difficulty for mild power gains, which neutralizes itself anyhow.

The shotgun is fun and balanced though, but honestly, feel no pressure to buy any DLC.",1704146629,1704320078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Capcom's reimagining of Resident Evil 4 is a testament to the studio's commitment to both honoring the source material and incorporating contemporary gaming advancements.

Graphically, the Resident Evil 4 Remake is a stunning achievement. The environments, character models, and lighting effects have been overhauled to meet the expectations of today's high-definition standards. From the eerie villages to the decrepit castles, each location feels more immersive and detailed than ever before. The character redesigns maintain the spirit of the original while showcasing the power of current-gen hardware.

The gameplay retains the core elements that made Resident Evil 4 revolutionary in its time. The over-the-shoulder perspective, introduced in the original, is refined to offer a smoother and more responsive experience. The updated controls and aiming mechanics enhance the sense of control, providing a balance between accessibility for new players and familiarity for veterans. The tension and fear-inducing moments that characterize the Resident Evil series are still very much intact, and the pacing of the game remains as masterfully crafted as ever.

The audio design, a crucial element in the horror genre, continues to excel in the Remake. The chilling sounds of the villagers' mutterings and the distant howls of unseen creatures create a haunting atmosphere that keeps players on edge throughout their journey. The voice acting, while maintaining some of the original's quirks, fits well with the game's overall tone.

One of the highlights of Resident Evil 4 Remake is the improved enemy AI. The hostile villagers, with their relentless pursuit and unpredictable tactics, provide a formidable challenge. The intensity of encounters is heightened by the enhanced enemy animations and behaviors. The iconic ""chainsaw-wielding"" enemies, for example, are now more menacing than ever, ensuring that the fear of being overwhelmed is a constant companion.

While the Remake stays faithful to the original narrative, there are some missed opportunities to expand upon the story or delve deeper into the lore. Given the advancements in storytelling in modern gaming, a bit more narrative depth could have added an extra layer to the experience. However, the game's commitment to nostalgia might be seen as a deliberate choice rather than a flaw.

The Resident Evil 4 Remake also faces the challenge of living up to the expectations set by its predecessor. Some purists might argue that the original game already achieved perfection, and any attempt to remake it risks altering the magic that made it a classic. Balancing the need for innovation with the preservation of what made the original great is a delicate dance, and not every fan will be pleased with the outcome.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 4 Remake successfully resurrects a classic, bringing it into the modern era with visual and gameplay enhancements that captivate both longtime fans and a new generation of gamers. While it may not entirely replace the nostalgia of the original, it stands as a worthy homage to one of the greatest survival horror games of all time. Whether you're a returning fan or a newcomer to the world of Resident Evil, this Remake provides an intense and gripping journey into a nightmare that feels both familiar and refreshingly new.",1704295788,1704295788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Bad game stability, if you have a lot of saves it takes AGES to just launch the game.
3. Very sluggish controller aiming due to scuffed deadzones/acceleration
4. Leon is very slow and sluggish, compared to re2 remake.
5. Annoying arbitrary accuracy on weapons, that makes you miss perfectly aimed shots for almost no reason.
6. Ada's VA sounds like grandma at a grocery store. Absolutely dead delivery of lines. Very off-putting and unenjoyable to listen to.

Overall, this remake balances between new and old while still retaining that sweet combat/horror balance that the original was known for. For that reason, I think that the remake is better because it adds a very clean visual experience to really take in the horror and environment in the RE engine. This is not a perfect game, mainly due to missing campaigns and mercenaries characters, as well as some other bosses. Unlike many though, I think there is enough replayabilty in this game (challenges,S+, new game plus) to keep me occupied until the campaigns are added if they will be. The MAIN game is what I was looking for in the first place and I think the removal of some bosses actually allowed for better pacing between bosses.

Pros:
-cinematic story
-improved experience with Ashley 
-side quests
-RE engine quality 
-fun combat
-neat controls
-Nice HUD and menu
-Horror/action balance
-replay ability 

Cons:
-Heavily action focused at times
-Still some weird VA
-Missing bosses
-missing campaigns and mercenaries characters 
-felt less interest in story and horror compared to re2 remake",1701572086,1704276537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly please make ALL the buttons and triggers remappable. Not everyone is the same and the limited setups are not going to cut it.

As a left-handed user I like to have movement on the right stick. But there is no option for this.

So as a controller player i have to use a combination of the Xbox accessories app to switch the sticks plus my trigger mapping software for my Turtle Beach controller to put reload onto a rear paddle. This is not great. It's time-consuming and fiddly as I have to then switch those profiles game by game.

I'm also really struggling to aim and change direction at the start of this game - thing is, you can't turn using the movement stick. That is ALL assigned to the look stick. I believe this is ""tank"" control system. This is not the case in recent Resident Evil titles and it's quite the task to retrain your brain to get over this. And when the game is done of course I won't have that problem because the newer titles have changed that for the better.

That's a pity because there are some improvements over the original e.g stealth kills. So I'm still stuck at the start but hey I will get over it.

And hey Capcom, when you do allow sticks to be switched in your games how can you NOT allow the buttons to be remapped to the d-pad? Think about it. Try moving with the right stick and pressing a face button to do a 180 which is an important move if you want to survive at higher difficulty levels.

I don't understand how this got to 97% positive reviews. The main problem here is that RE4 was a more action oriented game than its predecessors. Capcom kept that aspect but added the movement of the RE2&3 remakes to the mix and it doesn't mesh well at all with the combat scenes. Having your character tumble, stumble and fumble for every action you take is okay if your game has a slower approach to combat, but in a faster title like this it becomes tiresome after 10 minutes.
Here's an example: A group of enemies approaches. You headshot one of them and get the opportunity to kick him, which also hits the surrounding enemies. A classic RE4 move. Oh, but Leon's gotta go ""ergh.."" because you brushed one of the enemies and now it's too late. You're surrounded by goons. You quickly remember the flashbang you picked up and equip it in order to at least escape the situation. Oh, but Leon's gotta put away his handgun first, then proceed to pull out the flash and only now can you even begin to try and aim the damn thing. 

The remake also suffers from a very low FoV which makes it hard to see where you're going, especially during the more intense scenes. The original didn't have a very high FoV either, but you could still navigate the levels comfortably, even in the more open environments. Again, low FoV can be used to create a tense atmosphere but only in slower, more methodical games.

The third issue I noticed (keep in mind, I've played for 70 minutes at this point lol) is a very small HUD. Admittedly, this was an issue for me in RE2 as well and it may be personal preference but the health bar should be legible even at a glance. The button prompts for context sensitive actions often go unnoticed because they're attached to the object you perform it on and not centralised at the bottom of the screen like in the original. Once again, if the game is more action oriented, the HUD can't pull too many atmospheric shenanigans, especially if you insist on keeping it as small as possible like Capcom did.

This will be the second game I'll refund on Steam and the first one I'll refund because I didn't like it. It isn't bad or buggy or unoptimized. In fact it runs great and looks phenomenal. But it's constantly fighting with itself, forcefully trying to keep the action of the original while adding the modern controls and animations that were made for slower paced games, where avoiding combat in the first place was incentivised. Add the small HUD and the low FoV and you get a game that ends up being frustrating to play for all the wrong reasons.",1704143361,1704143361,False,1,0,0.383892625570297241,0,True,False,False

When the original RE4 came out it set the bar way higher for what RE games should be. Many people criticized the game as it lacked zombies. I however grew to love the new 3rd person 3D gameplay over the still background gameplay of RE3. Throughout my childhood i completed the game 8 times as well as the bonus missions and unlocked all mercenaries and weapons. I was looking forward to playing this game once it was released only to be let down by many different changes. It really upsets me how 19 years later we managed to produce a poor game experience using way more advanced technology. I havent finished this game but here is the list of changes i did not appreciate.
1) no more laser on handgun or any other firearm
2) was not given the option to help the wolf at the start of  beginning of the game.
3) deleted the part where leon runs from a rolling boulder
4) when captured with luis were not allowed to break the guys neck like in the original game to free the characters
5) when you kill the giant fish the rope does not tangle on leons leg
6) when the first giant comes out hes not dragged out by many guys like in the original game the new entrance is very lame
7) leon does not throw a knife at Salazar when they first meet so they never throw the knife back for you to dodge

This is as far as ive got in the game im sure there will be many more deal breakers if i continue playing. im scared that if i make it to the krausser scene with the knife fight ill be dissapointed as well. Thats if im lucky enough to have that still be part of the game. i guess we will see.

If you're a fan of this franchise: play this game. Another solid addition to this franchise, and an excellent redo, as stated above.
If you've never played an RE game... the shooting method in these games isn't the greatest. it's quite awkward, to be honest. It's over the shoulder, and for the most part, you CANNOT shoot unless you are aiming, and you walk very slowly when aiming. This game doesn't believe in hip firing. There are quick time events, but they really aren't that bad and they make sense for the situation. For example: a monster grabs you, quickly press a particular button to get out of the grab by either stabbing it with your knife or button mashing a particular button to get out of the grip in time. They aren't the annoying QTE's that ruin a boss fight, for the most part. That said, dodging, getting out of the way of things: it's kind of clunky. You press the button to dodge, there is a minor delay, and you might get hit. You generally won't, but you might. Movement isn't always the smoothest. You're running to get out of the way of an attack, and you're slow, sluggish, don't move very quickly, even at full health, you're just always not that spry, and so you get hit. This is an issue with every RE game. Characters just do not move smoothly. That said, you really shouldn't die more than once or twice a level, with a handful of exceptions, and you really might find yourself not dying at all even on hardcore, especially once you get the hang of the controls. That all said, if you enjoy horror settings, if you enjoy stopping black and white evil people, if you enjoy shooters, you'll like this game. The thing you'll likely like the least is your companion, but she gets kidnapped so often it's really not that bad, even for the levels she is in. And, the controls really aren't that bad if you're accustomed to RE games, which you'll get accustomed to the controls merely by playing the game. Finally, if you're worried RE4 is too far into the franchise to start, don't be. I'm not kidding when I say i've played these games extremely out of order. i went 4, 5, some of 6, 7, 2, 1, village, 4 with the remaster, and soon i'll be playing 3. And in every game, I followed the story just fine despite how absolutely out of order i've played these games. They are their own ecosystem. Some of them might share the same setting, you might run into characters your character knows but you don't, but you won't ever feel lost in the story, at least no more than your character does. If you're character doesn't know what's going on, you won't either. When they figure it out, you should hopefully be paying attention so you can figure it out, too. That's been my experience. So, pick an RE game, go play.",1704094958,1704095398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game, however falls into the former category, with intuitive controls that the original didn't have (keep in mind the original used the very same control scheme as the first Resident Evil game for the PS1), as well as being more chilling than the original. It also really expanded the lore that was already lacking in the original, with characters now having connections to the events of earlier RE games. Finally, Ashley is more likeable than in the original.

That said, one gripe I have is that the game tries to combine the REmake2 ""stand-still-and-get-a-steady-shot"" mechanic with the shaking gun mechanic from the original, meaning that regardless of whether the crosshair is closed in, it will always not be a very accurate shot, also you could no longer command Ashley to stay put or hide her in certain objects, which can be painful at times, and the knife is finite like in REmake 2 & 3, so you really have to use it conservatively.

Six years later, in Resident Evil 4 (2005), Leon returns as an agent for the U.S. federal government, as part of a special anti-Umbrella Corporation task force assigned to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a sinister cult. In Resident Evil 6 (2012), he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and an adult Sherry.

Leon is the protagonist of several Resident Evil games, novelizations, and other game franchises, including Project X Zone and Dead by Daylight. Leon appears in the CG animated films and in the animated miniseries. In later games, such as the remakes of Resident Evil 2 (2019) and Resident Evil 4 (2023), his features were based on Romanian model Eduard Badaluta. Several actors have portrayed Leon, including Johann Urb and Avan Jogia in the live-action Resident Evil films. Video game publications list Leon among the most popular and iconic video game characters, and he ranks consistently as a fan favorite character of the franchise.",1704062278,1704062278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has everything right... Of course it's not perfect and the AI can be a bit frustrating at times. It's clear they could improve on it a bit.

In my personal opinion, some of the ""encounters"" were poorly made. The ""Twin-Garrador"" and ""Ramon"" fights are long and drawn out on the first playthrough. They aren't hard, but nothing about them screams satisfying upon defeating them.

Although, I want to mention the most crucial piece of evidence to why this game is amazing. Why I can play this game repeatedly and don't want to touch RE2... There is no Mr. X gimmick! I hate with a burning passion any game that invites me to explore than proceeds to say, ""hurry up!"" Not to mention this enemy being immortal.

In RE4R you have a singular scripted event where you are chased by a Mr. X like enemy, but it's extremely short. If anything my first time through I loved the chase and having to run while dodging enemies. Even in the second playthrough I found myself enjoying the encounter. Why, what's different? Not only is it shorter by a mile, but soon after you get to face this enemy as a boss. A boss that is killable!

Overall, RE4R does a brilliant job in using a Mr. X like character. It's not drawn out nor is it annoying. It's an enjoyable encounter every time.

In my opinion the ""Regenerators"" are the perfect Mr. X enemy. They are horrifying and extremely difficult to kill on a first playthrough. Of course once you get the right gear they are trivial, but for a first playthrough they do the job of instilling fear into the player perfectly. Even though I can kill them easily, there appearance is still terrifying! Where as Mr X is basically a meme. You don't want an enemy designed to be terrifying to become a joke and that is why RE2 and RE3 failed in my opinion. 

Side note for those who enjoy parrying in games. This has a bit of a funky one. You basically can just spam the space bar to parry without consequence. Also I found it to be really inconsistent at times. Where you'll have someone trying to grab you and you go to press space just as they are coming and yet you still get grabbed. Other times you successfully parry them. I whole heatedly see why people install a parry mod because after doing enough mercenaries I strongly feel annoyed at times with how the enemies can just grab you regardless. 

If you find that you agree with what I've said and enjoy a game that gives you the freedom you want to explore... pick up a copy of RE4R and you wont regret it. I thought at first my computer probably wont be able to handle it, but it runs smoother than you might expect.

- Jogabilidade esta melhor que no clássico, pela possibilidade de usar teclado/mouse. 
- Alguma armas sofreram modificações, mas no geral muito bem balanceado.  
- Historia se mantem praticamente idêntica, com algumas leves alterações, porém, mantém a essência e narrativa interessante do começo ao fim.  
-Gráficos lindos, cenários e Layouts das fases muito bem estruturados.
- Para mim algumas partes ficaram mais assustadoras que original. Porem no original tem coisas mais assustadoras, o que da um empate.  ( Uma das partes mais assustadoras esta na DLC)

(Additional side wish - > magazine + 1... finally.... why can't other games get it right)

It would be that:
Any future Resident Evil ""remakes"" and future installments of the series take any number of lessons presented in this game to heart - and run with it and have fun with it. RE: 8 ""sort-of"" felt like it tried to copy the formula from this one but fell a bit flat. RE4 after RE2 has to be one of my favorites in the series as they did such a great job with this remaster.
The story is compelling, (most of) the characters are compelling and likeable, the gameplay is enjoyable. (Though we'll leave out that it is a 3PS console game). And my god someone finally gets reloading and racking a gun right where so many games get it wrong. FINALLY!!
Sure Ashley sequences can be annoying and she can get in the way till you figure out how to capitalize on it. But overall the story and segments are done fairly well for a remaster and much of the game lives up to the original. Only a few bits seem to be reworked but nothing as bad as RE:3 was gutted.

The only turn off I have of this game, (other than Kaiser, trust me, you'll get it when you play it) is the wrenching of control from the player EVERYTIME you get hit by the slightest bit of anything. Something hits you, you either flounder about on the floor for a minute and a half or the game completely wrenches control from you to have you locked into watching an enemy pose so very proudly with hitting you in an over-exaggerated cutscene-esque display. I understand they want to penalize you for getting hit and / or making a mistake but it is simply annoying. Whilst other enemies simply stand around waiting for everything to finish playing out because it is a console game and we can't capitalize on follow ups due to limited capacity console gameplay mechanics.

I'm looking forward to the next few remakes if they follow suit.",1703737754,1703994586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I completed it on PS5 and now on PC, and I'm generally pleased with the revisions. In my opinion, the PC version is better than consoles. Some of the changes are extremely severe, such as when particular people die or how they are presented, and they alter the tone and impact of the plot. However, I agree that they stuck true to the original to a large extent, and they tried their best to keep the game appealing, enjoyable, and full of personality. I liked what they did with Ashley; in the original, she was annoying and seemed helpless, like a large burden who shrieked frequently, but her remake version appears more authentic, and her connection with Leon appears more natural as it develops throughout the game, with their confidence in each other growing stronger. Ashley is a fun companion in this game, and I believe she brings a lot of personality to the game, some of which was not even present in the original. The NG+ and professional prizes are good and give some incentive to retry the game. The combat is really incredible. Each scenario now has additional depth and player options. The counterattack system is fun to learn, and the ability to hide mechanics gives you even more ways to approach each combat. The gun noises are flawless, the new gore system is vicious, and the enemy AI is significantly more terrifying and hostile. The knife is also more intuitive and streamlined, allowing you to slash without initially equipping or stab when equipped. The finishers are also fantastic, reducing the need to swip each downed adversary like a fool. When you combine this with freshly added ragdoll physics, destructible environments, new weapons, charms, and an infinite knife, the replay value skyrockets. Also, knife durability is important for balancing and making decisions. The tale and characters are more developed and fleshed out than in the original. Leon has a slightly more dramatic history, but he retains his charisma, charm, and sense of humor. Luis is given significantly more screen time and speech than before, allowing him to form a bond with Leon and have a true character/redemption arc. They even added files to his narrative and history with Umbrella. Krauser has also significantly improved. His past with Leon is substantially explored in the remake, adding to the emotional stakes and sense of betrayal that Leon is feeling. Moreover, Ashley is also far more solid, capable, and relatable than she was previously. Her relationship with Leon developed more organically and convincingly throughout the game, and I felt like she had earned a lot of confidence and experience by the end. Many people are complaining about Ada, but I believe they are exaggerating. Each individual's own. It was fantastic to see some of the Separate Ways storylines included in the main campaign. The remake also includes a lot of mythology that focuses on the game's religious and occult elements. From my perspective, the game is frightening. The increased distinction between light and dark is a wonderful improvement. The enhanced lighting and gorgeous skyboxes add to the gothic/folkloric ambiance and make opponents appear considerably creepier when they appear from around corners or behind you. The terror has been substantially intensified, and the plagas are more horrific and can even grab onto enemies. New enemy varieties, such as the brutal and ""broken neck"" Ganados, are extremely aggressive and entertaining to combat. Conclusion, I hope that in the next remake, Resident Evil 5 Remake, they can give Albert Wesker a new ending and continuing using his personality because Resident Evil is about Albert Wesker.",1703888177,1703888413,True,82,0,0.820435225963592529,0,True,False,False

RE4 is kinda leaning toward the combat side but still has adequate amount of the puzzle solving and survival horror side which makes it more friendly for people who are looking for a more combat focus but also a bit of puzzle solving and survival horror game play. There is option to play it stealth or play it guns blazing. Knife combat is great and feels really good especially when you parry an enemy and than shoot another enemy on the side with your pistol, it looks really cool which I really enjoy. For people who never played RE4 or RE in general I recommend going into standard first once you cleared it once boot up the new game plus and play it again on hard or above. Veteran will say standard is too easy which is true but for people who never played RE before or are not used to the 3rd person game play(Ethan generation) it is perfect. And yes buy the game if you haven't especially during seasonal sales I got it 50% off which is a steal but it is definitely worth buying even with its full price to encourage CAPCOM to produce high quality game like this in the future.",1703878268,1703878268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the game itself, it is a better version of a videogame classic: Capcom know what they are doing with the remakes of his most cherised saga, and this one is no exception.

This on the other hand was a surprising improvement over Village, and a genuine improvement over the game it truly serves as a sequel to, Resident Evil 2 Remake.
Yes. I played the demo in march, I was surprised, and now playing the full deal makes me glad we got this.
Resident Evil 4 Remake is the best Resident Evil Remake since the first Remake (tho definitely not better than that): Everything from Remake 2 is improved on in one way or another, from the removal of the bothersome Dynamic Difficulty (a good system for consoles, not so much for PC), to more satisfying enemy encounters, and to the puzzles as well. Controls feel buttery smooth, and though the changes from Remake 2's scheme take time to get used to, once you do you'll be navigating the Spanish wilderness in no time.

As a horror game, Remake 4 is a triumph, taking the already pretty scary though cheesy original and amping it up to eleven by not only modernising the iconic Las Plagas Zombies, but deliberately going for a darker, serious, more intense tone. The feeling of dread and panic you had when fighting hordes of enemies in the original 4 is increased, as although you can move while shooting, the Las Plagas Zombies have taken a lesson in ferociousness and bloodthirst. On top of that, there are some genuinely solid scares involving new dream sequences with Leon face-to-face with Saddler, and a few surprises I'm yet to see for myself.

I never thought I'd see the day when a seemingly-redundant remake ends up ALMOST topping an already timeless original, but here we are. I think I'll be missing out the next main Resident Evil game and seeing which remake they do next, be it a grimdark interpretation of 5 that serves as the game they were going to make before Keiji Inafune's westaboo tendencies took over Capcom and it became a co-op third person shooter knock-off of Dead Rising, going back in time for Code Veronica, or even one of the spin-offs like Dead Aim or Outbreak.

I liked the original, but it wasn't perfect whatsoever due to unintuitive and dated controls, terribly annoying escort missions, and constant quick time events that made the game a chore to get through, especially in the later chapters. This game fixes almost all of my gripes with the original, and then some. Ashley feels like a real person now, Luis is fleshed out more earlier on and is given a clear motivation instead of just popping in and out of the story like before, and the tone is a lot more realistic and less goofy. (though I will admit I miss Salazar's goofiness, he only [spoiler]appears about 3 times before you kick his ass[/spoiler]) One issue I do have, however, is the movement. While it's certainly better than the original's tank controls, it feels a lot more sluggish than the original. In the OG version it felt like whenever you did something, the game immediately responded. This game is a lot more sluggish. Animations take longer than they should (and sometimes play when unnecessary) and it's easy to be jumped by a bunch of enemies that will just stun lock you while Leon is still picking up a stick or something. It's a control scheme that works well in a game like RE2, but not that well in an action oriented game like RE4. For those who played RE2 and are used to the movement in that game, the movement, even with the longer animations, is a lot snappier.

Overall I'd say that this game is a major improvement on the original, and while I'd still recommend anyone looking to play this version to play the original first, for those just now getting into the series from the other remakes, as well as those getting into the series for the first time with this game, it's an amazing game on it's own, and one that I'd recommend even to those who don't like horror.

Firstly I thought it was going to be scarier, more along the lines of RE2 and RE3 but it seems more like an action game rather than survival-horror. The other thing is the combat; compared to the other two previously mentioned, it seems like I can just run through an area with lots of enemies without having to fight at all, whereas the other two I have to fight my way through of fear of getting caught by the zombie that blocks my path. I haven't completed it yet so these are my first impressions, hopefully my mind will change as I continue through the story. I'm still giving this a positive review spite these downfalls.

Pros:
1- Price is worth it for the Content and Repeatability.
2- A Good Remake for the Original Re4 (The Cast - The story setting - The animation - lore explanation through well written not long to read files found in game).
3- Excellent PC Controls, Aim Sensitivity and Character Actions for Mouse and Keyboard. In addition, the game allows you to customize each key and action where it provides you with a primary input (which pops up on the screen) and a secondary input. for example i have reloading set to the key ""R"" and also on my mouse ""Mouse 2 Button.
4- Very good Variety of Difficulty Scaling, Either by selecting it from the menu on a new run or when the game scales it up based on how well a player is preforming.
5- Excellent PC Graphics with a variety of graphic settings to tune the performance with FSR2.0 or FSR1.0.
6- The Shooting Range Mini Game, The Side Quests, The Game Challenges and Mercenaries mode is an absolute blast.

Nice to Have (wish they were in the game):
1- Wish there were more costumes to unlock.
2- Wish there were more higher difficulty settings for new game plus runs since the weapons will become stronger and especially if the cat ears are unlocked that provides Infinity ammo for every gun.
3- Wish they would allow you to swap the Main Character during a new game plus run (play as Luis character model for example).

Cons:
1- There are some cut content section (E.G: the fire breathing dragon area in the castle, no assignment Ada).
2- While Separate ways DLC was a blast and worth the price, in the original Re4 it was a free mode unlockable once you have finished the main game.
3- While the game provide you the ability to parry an attack or Evade (when promoted ) the game does not provide an ability to Dodge Roll similar to RE6 when you are surrounded by enemy AI.
4- To get a charm for your case (which enhances some abilities such as running faster) is based on RNG and the set of these charms are Pre-determined for each play-through. if this was a looter RPG shooter i would understand. but this game is not.
5- While the game provides a field of view scaler, still the field of View is still too Narrow at some sections, the game needs much more wider field of view scaler.
6- While the Game is considered a fast paced game (Action Survival Horror), the over the shoulder view does not change from left to right or right to left to look at the other corner for incoming enemies similar to RE6.",1703803853,1703803853,True,0,0,0.487013012170791626,0,True,False,False

The locations you visit and the environment has also been changed as well for the better, even putting in brand new sequences that were never in the original and taking you to brand new areas.

The combat has been completely overhauled to allow for fluidity in fights, even just using the knife is extremely satisfying and an entirely viable option (assuming you can time your button presses correctly.) A lot of the issues and criticisms of the original have been fixed such as Krauser's introduction and presence in the game being unexplained. 

As for criticisms and bugs, I only ran into one on my playthrough where Ashley's pathing seemed to break and she almost phased in next to me, however this was a one of occurrence and never happened again.

The story finds Leon S Kennedy some years after the events of Raccoon City, having been recruited into a special ops unit designed to help handle sensitive matters. In this case his first big mission is to rescue the presidents daughter have she was kidnapped by an unknown party some where in Europe. If you've played the original then this should be familiar ground but at the same time the story provides more context and much more believable style of story telling that, while differs a little bit from the original, certainly adds to it as a whole. 

So if this remake has changed things how's the gameplay? Very much a more modern take while taking lessons learned from previous remakes. You essentially get the best of both worlds here. You still get to use melee, knife attacks and even the classic tetris like atmosphere of the attache case management all while combining modern standards like moving and shooting while aiming. Some things there were not present in the original are here now and they really help with the moment to moment combat and overall flow. 

As for the remake itself Capcom has hit it out of the park again. The developers here really went into a bit of a deep dive on the story and kept a lot of the iconic scenes and situations from the original present while providing a fresh take on them and the changes made work really well. The story and characters all strike a different tone from their original counterparts and the end result is a much more grittier take and less hey lets go rescue the girl like atmosphere. The changes range from entire redesigns of areas to more streamlining of levels with a much more better flow and less confusion than the original. They've also wisely removed the QTE events of the original which is quite a welcome change as they've focused more and actual game play and story telling rather than supplementing it in parts. Of course they've also heavily beefed up the overall graphics to the standards found in their previous remakes of RE2 and RE3. 

So should you buy it? As a whole I'd say yes but wait for a sale. The game certainly has much more content than the original does by a long shot and is arguably the definitive version of Resident Evil 4 thanks to the overhauls found throughout the game in general. If you've never played the original version then get this one same thing if you did. This is easily one of the best games 2023 had to offer.

The great part is that Capcom clearly understands the game-y nature of Resident Evil but these remakes have largely managed to balance the horror elements with the game elements. I liked RE3R, even when most didn't, because it too ironically suffered from the same issues as RE3R.

The mechanics of the original game are there, in all their glory, but it's more complicated. You can parry nearly every attack in this game with the knife. It's stupid and glorious and I love it. It feels like they cribbed a ton of notes from Kamiya's RE 3.5 ideas from way back when the original game was in its early stages of development too, which is also great. Capcom did not mess around with this game and it shows.

The bosses are compelling, the storytelling is fantastic and campy when it needs to be and serious when it needs to be as well. These characters feel like real people. Ashley's section is fantastic and still serves as a skill check for you as a player (can you move around enemies and avoid their attacks?) while at the same time showcasing how brave she's being.

The hype is real. It's just that good. I'm probably going to pump an inordinate amount of hours into this game, not because I love RE as a franchise, but because this game is such a love letter to the original RE4. You can see the TLC they gave this game, and how they made their characters human and real. I love campy Leon but I dig this portrayal of Leon just as much.

i also have re3 but dont want to play it for now... for a while. lol. because of my experience of re series.

Unfortunately, despite being remake, Capcom games (or most of the japanese games) still contain the logic of the 90s arcade system. But we are playing from pc, with a keyboard. Even if you aim at head of zombie, if you do not press specific button that appears at that specific moment, it can move faster from bullet, stab an axe in your neck and kill you instantly. You cannot move and act freely. its not like ""what you see and what you get"" lol. when you come in an ""action room"" you understand something is going on.  you need to die 1-2 times to understand what is the tactic(or mechanic) of that action room. and when fight starts even a missed bullet can change lots of things. Generally you discover everything with fighting. But its hard to find gunpowder. weapon upgrades are expensive. that could be normal ok. but also ammo crafting materials are very rare.
if you die in same spot over and over again, game asks to decrease the difficulty. but easy is too much ""easy"". 

So its pretty hard to try&fail process in RE games. You can see some special gun dlcs for Re games. You just dont want to struggle to play that game over again. And same thing for achv. you need to be a fanatic and dedicated to run that game 5-10 times because of its bulky gameplay. (or simply you can open a youtube video in another window and watch&play as a solution. which kills the fun.)

The worst thing to me: it crashes!
after 20~ hours, In the museum section, when I put on the last head of the statue, the game crashes in the cinematic. where control is given to Ashley. Even though I checked the files over and over again and turned the graphics down to low, it didn't help. im still searching to fix it...

I am always sceptical about remastered games, but this one is a fantastic iteration.

True to almost all of the most wonderful moments of the original game, the remastered version adds fantastic mechanical quality of life measures that add to the game without taking away from it's spirit. Our favorite medallion hunts, snakes in the crates, and attache managment are all there, and with cool new ways to play the game and see new little secrets and quirks to enjoy so it doesn't feel *too* nostalgic.

The maps have been expanded and made even more interesting without wiping away the nostalgic memories.
Extra lore has been added to make you feel even more attached to the old game.

And thankfully, Ashley - while still a bit of a damsel in distress - is no longer a shrill, sarcastic companion you secretly hate, but a reasonably independent partner that is just a little in over her head. It's nice to see a bit of a step forward in this respect.

let me explain, if you have played the original RE4 on every platform it's been released on like me, and loved every moment of playing that game, then you'll hate this game from a comparison, the VA's are worse, the dialogue is ""worse""(meaning that they took out 99% of what made the lines in the original so damn good), and the gameplay is completely different. BUT if you go into this game thinking of it as it's own thing, and not a remake of the original, then it's actually pretty damned good.

this game isn't ""the best thing since internal plumbing"" like some reviews would leave you to believe, there are some bullshit elements to the gameplay that leaves a bit of a sour taste, but overall it's not bad. the gun-play is fine, the movement is again fine, the enemies have some really dumb hitboxes sometimes, and none of the enemies that have a plaga pop out of their heads can be oneshot with anything OTHER than a rocket launcher(i know it's a really weird gripe but still it's true), like the plaga HAS to pop out of their head and THEN you can finally kill them. 
                 The boss fights are a bit, odd because they are all in extremely tight spaces, other than del lago that is, which makes the boss fights claustrophobic. also thay have made some ""special"" bosses that cannot be damaged by regular guns, they have to be damaged by something else, the main ones are the armored 'el gigante' you can shoot them with every bullet you have but they will not take damage. another ""boss"" that is very weird is the dark/black 'regenerator' they have 2 or MAYBE 3 stages(it's really hard to tell because you fight them in near pitch black areas), but they start out as a normal regenerator, and the same can be said for the iron maiden variant.

the dialogue, i swear to Christ this is the WORST part of this game, the dialogue and the VA's themselves nearly RUIN every single cutscene in the game, the VA's read their lines like it's their first time ever seeing the script, the lines seem like they were written by someone who has never heard a catchy one-liner in their life, yet they try really hard to write one-liners. I genuinely cannot think of a single line from this entire game, it's all completely forgettable within 2-3 minutes.

the graphics, they are pretty good, not great by any means but they are good.

all in all, if you managed to read that completely incoherent review, the game is great if you can find it on sale, it's a good 10 hour playthrough maybe more depending on how many of the cutscenes you can stand watching.",1703666876,1703666876,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

After Capcom threw the now legendary games RE7, RE2R, RE3R & RE8 (+ the DLC for the games) into our faces in just 4-5 years, the work they've done on all games is incredible and also it's super impressive to pull off. 
Resident Evil 4 Remake puts more fuel on the already insanely long Resident Evil train, giving it lots of high quality action & horror. 
The graphics are godlike (like the last 4 entries), the story is fantastic, the characters are incredibly designed and the length of the game is perfect.

All the cool mechanics from RE:3 like the utilisation of your knife are kept here, and the dodging has been turned into blocking. Here, however this actually plays well with the actual game, you will be swarmed by infected villagers a lot more than you were with zombies in the previous games, there is some special kinds of infected, they can use weapons like crossbows, torches and pitchforks which they can also throw at you. You will often fight in semi-open areas with a decent possibility of going in with stealth. The open spaces are not working against the game here thanks to the crazy amount of the infected that you will fight all at once as well as their mobility - you need to constantly be on the move, run and jump from place to place, barricade yourself in a house and once breached leave through a 2nd story window and sprinkle it with a superhero landing and some cheesy comment. Yes, the combat here feels fu****g amazing, and Capcom knows that very well, hence why they were so happy to give us Mercenary mode (arena shooter) which is a ton of fun. 
Seriously, usually open spaces work against these kind of games, but here it just works. There's a lot of enemies at once, rushing at you from all directions, grappling you so that someone else can stab you in the tummy, they throw things, the shoot things, they climb things, they release mini-bosses! There's always a lot of action, and the map works in its favour with all the swarms, but it doesn't just favour them, because like I said, it does allow for you to attempt stealth, which works very well, actually, but it also provides you with shortcuts, emergency exits (or threats) and barricades during combat.
First of all, the graphics look wonderful again, the gameplay feels amazing as usual, the campaign is actually really solid length here, I mentioned the additional arena gamemode, and now we also got a full on DLC with essentially more campaign, this time from the side of Mommy Wong, and the game once again encourages you to play through it multiple times, get better score and earn new rewards/unlockables/outfits, additionally there's now a trader system which enter wines very well with the exploration in here, given you can collect not only resources but also money and valuables which you can then combine and sell for more, along with doing some small side objectives, oh and even a fricking shooting range is here where you can compete for additional prices like perks to use in game. Seriously, this year Capcom truly just went with the intention of giving us FUN, like - what else could we possibly want in a game?
The further you are in the game the more difficult it gets with the enemies being visibly more prepared, but also you get a big variety of your weaponry and an upgrade system. We got some really welcome QOL changes that were not present in the original game, like the ability to send unwanted weapons from your EQ straight to your stash, but they managed to keep it balanced, disallowing you to leave ammunition behind. 
A big change from the original game is also the character of Ashley, which people naturally found annoying back in the day, but here she feels a lot more natural and a lot more likeable. They also made the interaction between her and Leon a lot less cringy and ""creepy"" - namely that last conversation they have at the end of the game.
Sadly, with all that great combat, animations, sounds, graphics and gore - for some reason the developers are just allergic to making the main protagonist gore-able, well - with a certain exception in the Separate Ways :) Still, I'd love for them to change their mind, but it doesn't hurt the game in any way, just a preference.
You can acquire some additional DLC's here that people have complained will make the game too easy, which I totally agree with - don't get the upgrade tickets out of the shop, you get more than enough to feel adequately powerful in your first playthrough if you're willing to do the bare minimum of exploring, and the second playthrough (you can decide to keep your weapons and upgrades from previous playthrough) will give you enough to make you literally kill a lot of the enemies with 1 or 2 shots.

If you liked any other RE game - just get this and enjoy yourself. I loved RE:2, and after RE:3 I was going to dodge this game but after I played the demo I just had to buy it, now I can't even return to RE:2 :P",1703602327,1703603451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am not trying to sound as if I have a hard-on for the original game. To me, the original game is just better in terms of what you get for what you pay, even though a lot of the mechanics of that game are horribly outdated. In the original game, you get so much more in terms of experience and storytelling. In the remake, most of the main story just feels like a copy/paste with extra steps. There are a lot of cool things here and a lot more bad things than I would like to admit. 

I'm only recommending this one because it really isn't that bad of a game (and I am willing to put my own personal feelings aside to tell anyone reading this that it is worth your time and money. The main story took me 12-16 hours to beat my first time, and I took as much time as I needed because I wanted to collect as much as I could and do all the side missions). For a remake (RE2:R had way more soul and replayability), the new mechanics introduced get repetitive fast which really sucks. The parry mechanic is nice but it really is the most inconsistent thing ever. Enemies can throw axes at you from 100ft away and always hit. In the original they would miss quite a lot, this made keeping your distance and moving around a great option to avoid these types of attacks. The grab mechanic from the enemies is still very present, but the enemies prefer to do that a lot more. This essentially forces you to use your knife and in turn spend more money to keep it repaired (wasn't even a thought in the base game, nothing had durability, and the knife was a great fallback. This makes the point of a trusty knife pointless as it breaks after 10-20 uses...). Stealth is a new mechanic they expanded on, but you don't have to sneak around to be effective at it. Stealth was also present in the last game, but you couldn't perform finishers, it was not as fleshed out in the original. Guess what the stealth forces you to do? Use your knife and waste it's durability! Let's talk about the grab mechanic that the enemies can do to you a little more. You escape from grabs with a button mash, and enemies can hold you down for others to do more damage to you. This feature was also present in the original making it nothing new here. There is an accessibility option that lets you turn it into a 'button hold' but you will lose more HP because it doesn't work as fast as the mashing, forcing you to use your knife. I quickly just turned this off and went back to button mashing, which totally makes this hold option useless as you'll just end up dying a lot more with it on. 

The story includes a lot of cut content that couldn't make it in the original game. This is really nice, however it really doesn't change much about how we remember the game, it's just fan service to me. This really could have been fleshed out a lot more in my eyes (remember watching Leon in the haunted mansion for the betas? Why wasn't there some sort of extra mode or part of the story that was like that in terms of cut content?). 

I cannot tell you how annoying it is to hear constant breathing from Ashley and Leon just because I decided to run literally 5ft up a hallway. Ashley isn't as annoying in this game because I do not have to babysit her as much. At the same time, she is also very annoying in many other ways because she just doesn't know when to shut up!

Capcom, charging $10 for Separate Ways is absolutely disappointing in every way I can imagine when it came free with the original game and so did Assignment Ada (which really doesn't exist at all). I preordered this game, and all I got were a few bonus weapons, some charms, filters, and costumes... That's awful man. If you are going for an S+ rank on Pro mode, you will not even use the weapons because they impact your final rank. Now keep in mind in the original game both extra modes offered unlocks to the main story (Separate Ways and Assignment Ada) which made it worth your time to play these modes! I do not own Separate Ways, so i cannot say for sure what you get when you beat that. What I have heard is it's just another fan service sort of deal, and looking at community screenshots and content for that DLC makes me feel gross because it is mostly P O R N... I will not support this kind of BS DLC behavior.

Get this game on sale, don't get the deluxe edition because you aren't missing out on anything there (unless you can get Separate Ways with it in some way). Or if you are feeling spicy, get the original game, and experience a more streamlined story and simple mechanics that still hold up.",1680295750,1703417980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a great example of a solid title, the core game holds itself up amazingly well alongside the updates made to it's graphics and overall feel. Super solid title in the first place only made better during the remake.

The only real problem with this game is that its difficulty doesn't hold up when you hit all headshots with 99% accuracy, and this trivializes the difficulty on PC as it was designed for console aim; and getting those headshots is extremely easy. The way the enemies move allowed for me to entirely rely on the sniper when backed into a corner or any other situation they clearly expected you to use a close range weapon. The only times I was ever in danger was during the cheap tricks the game pulls a few times, and when farming achievements related to boss fights.

The actual game itself, the gameplay, how it feels to control, shoot, enemy AI, inventory management, etc, feels nearly perfect for what I expect and want from a 3rd person RE game.
However as a remake, it fails in too many ways to ignore. The overall atmosphere, story, tone and memorable moments from the original have either been removed entirely or replaced with inferior interpretations of the original moments. While the original was a goofy B movie with genuinely great horror atmosphere and set pieces, this remake aims for a more down to earth and serious tone, which I believe to be a mistake and a critical misunderstanding of what the original game was going for.
Excellent game, bad remake.

It's a remake of the beginning and pinnacle of dumb, action focused Resident Evil games. Having played the original within the past year I can still say they're both great games even if one is now old enough to vote. Whether you played the original or not, this is a must play if it looks at all interesting to you. I'd also still highly recommend the original if you haven't played it ever or recently.

For some context of what I value in my Resident Evil games, here's my updated franchise rankings:
[olist]
[*]RE2
[*]RE1:Remake
[*]RE3
[*]RE0
[*]RE1
[*]RE:CV
[*]RE4
[*][b]RE4:Remake[/b]
[*]RE3:Remake
[*]RE2:Remake
[*]RE7
[*]RE8
[*]RE5
[*]RE6 (the only game I [b]DON'T[/b] recommend playing)
[/olist]

[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
[*]The remake manages to maintain the feeling of being overwhelmed and cornered in fights despite Leon now being able to move and shoot. The enemies are incredibly aggressive which makes the moment to moment gameplay a ton of fun.
[*]Ashley is an infinitely more likable character. The voice actress really did an amazing job with her.
[*]The game is fun enough that I plan on playing through it again soon despite just finishing it.
[/list]

[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
[*]Despite having a better personality, Ashley has a deathwish and can't wait in place unless you find a locker. She's also with you for more of the game which highlights her suicidal tendencies.
[*]There are two ways to dodge attacks beyond just walking out of the way, parry or dodge. Both of these can only be done on some attacks. Learning what you can or can't do is a bit of trial and error and some are much more intuitive than others. Some bigger attacks pop up a massive ""PARRY"" or ""DODGE"" prompt on the screen while others rely on you watching the bottom corner of your screen for a incredibly brief popup. It's small enough that I beat the entire game without knowing that you can parry arrows despite being shot by them more times than I can count.
[*]Stunning enemies from attacking certain body parts is now random compared to a well placed shot to the head or shin consistently causing the enemies to react in a certain way. This is now a nice to have that you can't rely on for offense/defensive strategy that I feel hurts the game. Maybe they did this since you already have a parry on your knife but I miss it dearly.
[*]Some Iconic fights and bosses are missing that I really liked.
[*]The charm system in incredibly underwhelming. I guess it's cool that I can heal more with just a green herb but I'm so bummed this is my payout for the shooting gallery.
[*]Do people like the gun powder system? I hate it. Just give me ammo so I use a variety of guns and don't just take the optimum path and horde magnum ammo like my brain will always force me to.
[*]I eventually hit a point where upgrades felt useless that I didn't feel in the original. Maybe it's because you never get an exclusive upgrade like making homes homing or making shotguns do max damage at any range or maybe it's the ammo problem from the last point. I'm not sure.
[/list]

[u]Mixed Feelings[/u]
[list]
[*]I will always have a strange relationship with Resident Evil 4. It's an objectively good game but it turned a franchise I adored into a new genre that was light on horror while being full of horrible plots and the dumbest action nonsense imaginable. RE4 2005 was turned up to 11 in every action and campy story beat. 2023 tries to dial it all back but not fully while also adding some more horror while cutting some really creepy sections. It's a weird mix of it being more grounded but still absurd. I kinda wish they went all one way or the other but I don't know how you send a one man to rescue the daughter of the president of the United States without knowing it's the dumbest plot ever.
[*]The one-off blue medallion quests now are one of many optional side missions you'll find in areas. I love the idea of this but the rewards just aren't worth the time spent after a while.
[*]The new knife functions are cool but I miss having a melee weapon I could count on as an offensive option without worrying about it breaking constantly.

He went from a rookie cop in well over his head to an incredibly boring and un-entertaining action guy in a mediocre action film-in-game-format.

It's just an over-the-shoulder shooter game with a pseudo-Resident Evil coat of paint. If you want the shooter part, there are better ones out there. If you want Resident Evil, go play the Resident Evil 1 or 2 remakes, or Resident Evil Zero.

If I had to give one bright spark for the game it's in the Separate Ways DLC. Ada Wong is extremely competent and, crucially, DOES NOT throw away her competence to favour Leon over what she's got going on. She's fond of Leon but barely tolerates him when he starts talking about messing with her mission. It's refreshing to see those priorities, and continues the established canon of Ada Wong having more going on than just seeing Leon.",1703287952,1703287952,False,1,2,0.403260082006454468,0,True,False,False

The ""modern"" Resident Evil series is my current favorite, hands down, but biases aside there is a clear consistency of quality in the series since Resident Evil 7 (I know, I know, 3R is the weakest but I still enjoyed it). Resident Evil 2 Remake was essentially a perfect remake, but somehow Resident Evil 4's Remake has one-upped the previous entry. It is the most approachable and accessible Resident Evil game, and I think it is the perfect entry to start off with if you are looking to try out the new era of this series. The combat is fast and rewarding, the characters and story have both been improved immensely, and it pays attention to its predecessor to frame the ways the modern iteration was crafted all while creating a very healthy dish of horror to boot. 

[h3] Mechanics [/h3]
This game is the most drastic of an overhaul compared to its original predecessor (among the remake series) but it's impressive how this was mostly achieved by the melee overhaul to the knife combat. Parrying is now a core mechanic to the gameplay and allows Leon to play incredibly aggressively, as it fits perfectly into the new faster-paced combat that FINALLY ditched the tank-controls. Each weapon feels different and equally rewarding to use, and the developers clearly made an active effort to craft the player's experience to be as enjoyable and gratifying the entire time through. I found myself finding a ""flow"" of sorts that rewarded a diverse and offensive style to the fighting, and this was all necessary since there the enemies are both plentiful and AGGRESSIVE. The good thing to this entry too, for those worried about the ""survival"" part of survival horror, is that you don't really ever need to manage ammo heavily; [b] just shoot the mf's, the game will give you enough ammo. [/b] Each boss fight and enemy encounter feels very dynamic but if you can learn the basic ""flow"" of the combat you can really take anything on; the game rewards your efforts and you feel your competency improving steadily which is challenged by progressively difficult encounters.

[h3] Characters/Story [/h3]
I personally think that the story and presentation of the remake series is much better than the main series (7 and Village), and the voice acting is the primary example of this. Leon and Ashley feel much more realistic while still exhibiting their classic personalities: Leon is still stoic and a badass but has a clear battle with his Resident Evil 2 PTSD. Ashley and Luis are both vastly improved and have added character development that makes you feel invested in their arcs. Ashley's growth over the game and her dialogue helps solidify the relationship with Leon as the two try to survive and the additional story beats given to Luis makes you understand his motivations much better. The story itself was very enjoyable, albeit still corny and camp, but at the same time the environments and enemies create an atmosphere of gothic body horror that grounds the experience in a secondary lense of seriousness and drama. Despite that, the game still nails the cinematic feel to its action and makes the pacing feel well rounded and urgent, something that the other remakes opted to keep slow and steady. 

To make a long fuckin story short, I put a whole bag of jelly beans up my a- I mean, the game is a 10 for me, and it felt entirely earned. This is another entry into a PHENOMENAL modern series, and whoever is running the dev team should be given attention they deserve. If you can pick it up, you will not regret it whatsoever. Shoutout to the director(s) and producers to this game and the new era of the series.

I first played the original with my friend on his big brothers game cube like 15 years ago so when I first heard that it was getting a remake I was both excited and nervous to see on how it would turn out and man oh man I was not disappointed at ALL!

I did get the original version on Steam and was meaning to play it just so I could relive the time when me and him were playing it at night and were trying to finish it but that all changed when this was announced and I'm glad I waited for it. First off, the game is just gorgeous. Dark, atmospheric, and gritty. It took me about 22 hours in beating the main storyline and then I started my second playthrough because now I wanted to reexperience it again and try to get all the achievements and try to complete the challenges that the game has to offer. I was never really a devout completionist to begin with but I am for the games that I love and RE 4, this remake and the original 2005 version, is defiantly a must play for all horror game fans.

I really don't need to tell you that for sure. While I did just focused on completing the main storyline and paid little attention to the side stuff until my second playthrough. The maps, the level design, the story, and the mechanics really are something that is worth playing and experiencing. The bosses and the enemies were wicked as hell especially when it’s night out and just when you thought you killed a villager by blowing it’s head off with a shotgun the Plaga Guadana would pop up and it will try to ♥♥♥♥ you up. The Plaga Mandibula on the zealots at the castle, and finally the Plaga Arana. These parasites gave me mad H.P. Lovecraft/H.R. Giger vibes and I love it. Fighting Salazar, Krauser, and Saddler was pretty epic. They weren’t difficult on normal difficulty but the way they looked in their monster form they looked cool as ♥♥♥♥. I just wished I had the balls in killing the Verdugo instead of running away to the elevator to escape it but I did on my second playthrough and he was one tough mf. Mendez was me and my friends favorite in fighting and me and him were creeped out by him. The first Garrador fight was nerve wrecking and fighting two of them at the same time along with zealots was also quite a challenge. Lastly, the Regenerators and the Iron Maiden was by far my most personal favorite in fighting. When that thing spikes up and comes at you ♥♥♥♥ me I got the chills seeing it again.

Now I’ll probably come back and write more for this review since I do want to replay the game again to have more time to give my honest thoughts about everything and mostly because the dlc Separate Ways just came out and I’m still in the process in trying to get all the achievements. With what I experienced so far. Not only is this one of the best remakes that I have ever played but it is one on my top 5 most favorite games to come out this year.

The gun play and combat mechanics feel amazing there are a ton of different weapons to choose from and each fill a different play style, tons of variety on how to tackle different encounters, stealth kills were really satisfying and helped with thinning out the hoards, overall a ton of variety in the combat.

The story was pretty good too, loved all the characters, Ashley is way more tolerable if not actually an awesome character in the remake, Luis is still an absolute chad, and the rest were pretty good too.

The graphics are amazing, RE Engine just does some amazing work with the photogrammetry, the environments are incredibly detailed and sharp. there is so much attention to detail in objects and characters and just in general Capcom packed some amazing detail into every part of this game. However the RT implementation was pretty lackluster, I honestly could not tell the difference between it on and off except for the FPS counter going down, not really a game breaking issue for me as I generally run games with RT off anyway but overall the graphics presentation is amazing 

Stability was really good the RE engine is extremely optimized on PC and i had a really stable experience with my frame rates and frame times, almost no stutters except when loading in new areas, and overall the performance was really good on both my systems (Desktop: 5800X3D, 32GBs RAM, RTX 4080, Laptop: Ryzen 5900HX, 16GBs RAM, RTX 3070 140W). I only experienced a small amount of bugs although non of them were game breaking. stuff like the dogs not spawning in on the second visit to the village on one of my playthgroughs or once I had a enemy fall through the floor but that was it.

The difficulty was challenging without feeling unfair, even the standard difficulty provided a decent challenge and it only went up from there but at no point did it ever feel like it was too difficult or unfair

The UI in RE Village was dogshit. They made it so much nicer and more intuitive in this game; who knew Japanese people could do it. Even the treasure mechanic where you put gems together and some combinations give more value is its own little mini-game. Great villains and bosses. Gorgeous environments.

It's not Resident Evil. It's the same rubbish as it was in 2005.

It's phenomenal. Literally the only gripe i could possibly have is that Ada's VA sounds a bit emotionless most of the time. Like a lack of feeling or something like that. It doesn't really matter anyway because everything, and i mean everything, everything else is built to perfection. Each of the Major Sections of the game are a blast to play through. People have said in the past that the island section the weakest area of the game, and while that may still kinda be the case (I think the island is fine but i can see why others aren't too much of a fan of it), It's still good in my opinion. Everything is just amazing. RE4R manages to stay faithful to the end while still improving and expanding areas, mechanics, while also adding a healthy bit of replayability on top. Gameplay is satisfying. Takes just a little bit of time to used to, but it is good, i promise. segments with Ashley are arguably more fun and less stressful, so that's a nice plus. The Merchant is still a dope and cool character all around, and the firing range is back and gives you tokens as rewards so you can get some nice charms (basically modifications to boost stats and all that, can equip up to 3 at a time).

The game's length is longer, for me at least. i'd say you'll definitely have to put in around 10-12 hours. Good chance you'll put in a lot more though, but it doesn't matter anyway because it just gives you more time to have fun with the game.

This game is a 10/10 and you could play it and have fun even if you haven't played the original RE4. If you do play this and like it, go ahead try out the original sometime.

The only couple of smaller negatives are the visuals, which are a slight downgrade from RE Village. The colors and lighting in HDR is a bit more muted here, than the few previous RE remakes (besides the increased complexity and vegetation detail). However, the overall art direction is excellent. Pushing the HDR brightness rather high, gives the visuals a more balanced look, as well as using a mod to remove the heavy-handed vignetting.

The other issue is the new voice actor for Ada, who is very underwhelming, unlike the woman that voiced Ada in RE2 Remake - she was great. You have this gorgeous character, but with an unattractive and dull voice now. It's jarring, and a disappointing slip in quality for such an important character - especially considering the original voice actor was dropped for BS reasons by Capcom.",1700579233,1703075027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Until one day i was scrolling through steam to find a game and I stumbled across this game, Resident evil 4. I looked at the reviews and heard that this was an overall fun story game. So like any other person I downloaded it. After playing the game for a few hours I became addicted and beat the game after 12 hours. Once I beat the game I couldn't stop smiling at the ending. The graphics of the whole game were amazing, the voice acting was incredible and every one did a great job, and the whole story was well written and thrilling. Once I beat the game, I then went on to beat the game 5 more times and had fun with every play through. I then soon downloaded the other games and too had fun beating the other ones and every time I beat one I could't stop smiling. Overall this game was worth every penny I used to pay for this game and I would personally recommend this game to any one who likes story games like; God of war, The last of us, or Silent hill.

For the most part, it significantly improves many aspects of the original game design. For example the combat, treasure system, exploration, weapon variety, story, and replayability, while also faithfully recreating and changing many beloved moments, resulting in a game that's one of the best in its genre.

 Leon is as cool as ever, carrying over a more mature version of his character from the remake of Resident Evil 2, with a great performance by the same actor who portrayed him in that game, Nick Apostolides. His performance manages to be just as cool as Paul Mercier, while also being a bit more serious. Leon now has more hand to hand combat moves & weapons training, plenty of great dialogue, great hair (especially if you have the Hair Strands setting maxed out), and his jacket now based off of the scrapped RE 3.5 design.

 There are still many things I prefer about the original, like it's unique tone, and I think it manages to create a more ethereal atmosphere through it's quirks, eerie music, and color palette, however for most people I think those things won't matter. 
 
The great thing about this remake is that it doesn't make the original game obsolete, and I can enjoy both for different reasons. There are things that I prefer about both games, but I think for most people who haven't played the OG, this is a great place to start.

Hats off to Capcom for managing to successfully remake one of the greatest games of all time, and somehow managing to improve on so many different aspects of it. 10/10",1702942674,1702942674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Making a remake of such a highly praised game must have been difficult, and yet, Capcom not only managed to keep true to the original, but they also managed to actually SURPASS the original in many ways. If you loved the original, you will likely love this too.

First of all, the gameplay itself feels much more modern and much more satisfying: say goodbye to tank controls, say hello to modern 3rd person controls. Leon can still kick and suplex enemies after they are staggered, but now he can also assassinate enemies by sneaking up behind them and he can parry enemy attacks with his knife.

Multiple characters got more development than they did in the original, making them feel more like real people rather than an archetypal caricature of their role. [spoiler]The writers also improved on making the effects of Las Plagas on Leon and Ashley more visible as the game goes on, which was sorely lacking from the original considering they were both infected. [/spoiler] While I will certainly miss specific campy lines from the og [spoiler]""Perfect, the big cheese,"" ""No thanks, bro."" ""Your right hand comes off?"" ""Got gum.""[/spoiler], they kept most of the lines and sprinkled them in where it makes sense. Not to mention, they added new hilariously cheesy lines, especially when Leon speaks, so it makes up for the loss overall. I think my favorite new line was when Leon said [spoiler] ""Guess your tapdancing days are over"" [/spoiler] That was one worry I had when seeing the trailers - will they make the game too serious? The core essence of RE4 consists of horror, action, and camp, not just horror. Luckily, they stick true to that essence, keeping and adding onto the campy undertones WHILE dialing up the horror and the action a bit.

The boss fights in this remake are God tier. Every encounter feels epic, courtesy of both the game design and the sound design. Even the more ""normal"" rooms are fraught with incredible tension - the devs leave the player with a lot of choice about how you want to approach things. While it can be fun to blast enemies into oblivion without any thought, I love thinking about strategies to clear a room without using too much ammo, and this game can reward that playstyle. One specific instance that stands out to me is [spoiler] how you could approach the double garrador room. Instead of shooting the adds or the bells right away, you can position ganado enemies in front of you when you make a sound so that the garradors would slash them up instead of you. [/spoiler] Super fun.

One minor downside is the voice acting for both Krauser and Ada - they fell a bit flat to me at first, but the voice acting really isn't as awful as some *cough* entitled fuckers *cough* say and their voices grew on me pretty fast.

Suffice it to say, I'll be playing through this multiple times. Capcom really knocked it out of the park with this remake by setting the bar for how remakes should be done. Hopefully we'll see more game remakes of this caliber in the future.",1679634464,1702930337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Less QTEs as seen from the Lake boss and Krauser fight. QoLs for Ashley is definitely welcomed. But as someone who has played the original multiple times and in multiple platforms i feel like the changes in combat, survival horror aspects and additional content just feels lacking. 

-------------
COMBAT
-------------
Combat still feels janky even with better and faster animations. Parry is amazing but feels lacking on its own. Fighting crowds feels like there needs to be a dodge mechanic in order for it to feel good, even the changes in boss fight mechanics could benefit from this instead of still relying on QTEs. Zombies feel like a downgrade compared to RE2 remake. I hardly felt the need to strategically hit the limbs for efficiency, instead, relied on blasting them on the head (this could also be a side effect of the storage changes).

--------------------------------------------
SURVIVAL HORROR ASPECTS
--------------------------------------------
Key survival horror aspects are still there, like inventory management, limited resources, etc. 

-- Health Recovery --
Herb abundance have been balanced compared to the RE2 remake's over abundance. 

-- Storage --
You can no longer store Herbs, throwables, and ammo in the typewriter storage. Forcing you to use everything that you have, making the newly added parry system almost useless since i can just *pew pew pew* my way through anything. Gone are the days where you hoard every single magnum bullet and use them all for the final boss. You will be missed. 

-- Crafting --
Ammo and throwables can now be crafted with Gunpowder and Resources. While this may be good in theory, it simply lacks in execution. Drop rates for the required items are so bad that at one point during the early game, I found myself low on handgun and shotgun ammo but a lot of rifle ammo, i had no SMG at this point and the only rifle i had was the first one available. 

-- Autosaves --
RE2 Remake had this and it was very generous, it was a welcomed change for those who play these games for the story without putting too much effort in combat. This feature is available for assisted and standard difficulties. The difference with RE2 remake and this is that in RE2 i felt that standard still had a few punishment regardless, RE4 however feels like there is NO punishment. There is too much autosave points. This might be due to the fact that there is an unlockable professional difficulty. No wonder Hardcore difficulty was selected by default. 

-- Enemy Drops --
TOO MUCH SMALL AMOUNT CURRENCY!!!!! Not even enough to buy you a weapon upgrade. It also feels the amount doesn't scale well.

---------------------------------
ADDITIONAL CONTENT
---------------------------------
-- Side quests --
Too tedious. You're forced to backtrack. Can track location of ""hidden"" objects on the map. I did enjoy ONE side quest, which was a fight against 2 mobs and a miniboss. Rewards are... mid TBH. And it doesn't add anything to the lore/story. I feel like this was a missed opportunity.

-- Shooting Range --
This is very much enjoyable.


In closing, this is not a bad game. If you haven't played the original Resident Evil 4, then I would 100% recommend this to you. But for someone who has played and enjoyed multiple RE titles multiple times including the remakes, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to you in full price. This feels closer to RE5 than to their, back to form RE2 Remake. I would even go as far to say this is one of those nostalgia bait games like RE3 Remake.

It trapped them into removing some of the iconic one liners, dulled down the silly toddler salazar into a boring redesign, and Saddler is barely present until near the end because his over the top comic villian personality and scenes from the original wouldn't fit the tone of the game.

Ada is terrible. My god she has the most boring voice acting and lines I've ever heard. Redesigned her dress too for no reason? 

Luis went from a mysterious interesting side character who needed more depth into an annoying crack head who wouldn't stfu for 5 mins. The mines were annoying to play. Especially the cart section. ITS TIPPING ITS TIPPING LEON WE ARE TIPPING x100. Seriously almost muted the audio in that section. They tried to make you care because he wanted redemption but then dies 2 mins later. Completely forgettable character and honestly if he wasn't in this game and leon just found the medicine in a cabinet I wouldn't even care. 

Krauser is more fleshed out and gets two great boss fights? Did this guy justice. 

Ashley is a huge improvement to the original. She has a brain, has better scenes with leon that feel natural, and you don't to waste healing on her. 

 Game is missing the iconic chainsaw decapitation also.

The new ost for this game takes away so much tension in boss fights. The creepy music in the original fit the tone way more than the over the top orchestral scores they replaced it with. It's like I went from fighting scary monsters to feeling like I'm playing final fantasy with guns.

I think guns need a little less sway. Makes the target ranges more annoying than they need to be.

[h1]Story:[/h1]

The Resident Evil 4 remake follows Leon S. Kennedy, a former police officer, as he investigates the mysterious disappearance of the US President's daughter in a remote village in Spain. Along the way, he discovers a sinister plot involving a parasitic virus and must fight his way through hordes of infected villagers and other grotesque monsters. It's the same story we know and love with it's own unique feel. 9/10

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

The improvements to the RE4 remake gameplay have made it even more thrilling and immersive than before. The new parry system allows players to counter enemy attacks, adding an extra layer of strategy to combat. Gunplay feels nice and fresh with a large arsenal of weapons to dish out the pain. 9/10

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]

The graphical update in the Resident Evil 4 remake is stunning. The updated character models are more detailed and realistic, with lifelike animations and expressions (Leon's hair still blows me away). The environments are also more immersive and detailed, creating a truly believable world. The lighting and particle effects add an extra level of atmosphere and tension, making the game feel even more intense. 10/10

[h1]Sound/Music:[/h1]

The sound design in the RE4 remake is exceptional. The game's soundtrack perfectly captures the tension and horror of the game, with haunting melodies and eerie sound effects. It's worth noting that some of the voice acting is off, with certain characters delivering their lines in a less convincing manner than others. 9/10

[h1]Difficulty/Replayablity:[/h1]

The RE4 remake is a average difficulty game, requiring players to think strategically and manage their resources carefully. The game's difficulty does ramp up as you progress, with increasingly challenging enemies and boss battles. Some of the bosses are honestly lacking compared to the original but overall I was still very happy. The new parry system makes the game more manageable and rewarding to play. You will be replaying this game a few times not only for fun but also to obtain a multitude of acheivements. 10/10

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

The Resident Evil 4 remake is an even more impressive and immersive survival-horror game than the predecessor. The updated graphics, parry system, and gameplay mechanics have all had a significant impact on the game's overall experience.

The depth in progression , weapons, inventory management everything is so well done. The level design , exploration , the enemy variety & complexity , puzzles everything was so varied and kept me engaged till the end. These are the perks of a linear level based game design which just cannot be matched in open worlds. The gameplay and difficulty felt perfectly balanced. Great job Capcom !!

Visually the game presents great atmosphere and mood fit for the setting. RE Engine shines perfectly optimized , controls flawlessly a treat to play. 

My main complaint are the dialogues and characters. I get it that this is supposed to be a 2000's action movie kind of feel. But lot of times i felt the dialogues were just characters telling one another's name, speaking very brief 1 or sentences , never felt like real characters talking to one another. If the characters actually ""talk"" lot of the plot points would have been better. In terms of level design the island levels in later part of game felt rushed with mostly similar looking blocky buildings and corridors, I just loved the Spanish village and those levels more.

It does not replace the original game, it sits adjacent to it, and you can pick either flavor, but this also means that there's really no reason not to just pick the original.

I miss some of Leon's cheesy one-liners and sad attempts at flirting, but it's still both unnerving and campy, so I'll take it. There are some interesting twists here and there but overall it remains fairly faithful to the original. I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out.

That being said, I can't deny that I absolutely HATE the way it feels to move Leon around. It almost seems like he's drunk and swaying from side to side. Honestly, give me back the tank-ish controls from the original, because, while those controls weren't the best either, I'd take them over whatever the hell it is that they thought they were doing with this remake. I understand you're supposed to feel kinda vulnerable in this genre, but if I can barely move around with any consistency, how am I supposed to defend myself against the endless hordes that move this one more from being ""survival"" horror to ""action"" horror. You have to be quick sometimes, and I just don't feel that I'm capable with what's in front of me.

Again, this is an AWESOME remake that does the original proud, but with every adventure, new or remade, there's going to be some gripes. It's literally impossible to avoid. Still giving this a thumbs WAAAAAYYYYY up.",1698894317,1702535148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fights feel unique and fresh every time you encounter one, which is a lot, but they know when to give you time to breathe and take in your surroundings.

It's probably the best ""horror-action-shooter"" experience i ever had. 

It looks phenomenal.
It sounds great.
And it feels just good. The movement and shooting both feel ""heavy"" and clunky but in a good way. Leon is carrying a lot of equipment so it makes sense that he isn't the fastest nor can he do instant perfect shots. This, combined with groups of different types of enemies, can make the game stressful at times. But that's something i expect from a game like this.

The original game is from 2005 so there won't be anything new story-wise for old RE players. But for me, as someone who is new to this franchise, i would say that the story isn't ground breaking but it keeps you engaged and the game does have interesting side characters. 

I bought it for the full price and i would say that it is still worth it. Especially since this genre does not have many high quality games like this. The closest to it would probably be the Dead Space 1 Remake.

RE4 remake is one of the best remakes ever made, hands down. It stands as a titan alongside REmake from 2002 and is a testament that even critically acclaimed, 'perfect' games can benefit from getting remade for modern audiences.  After RE2Rs lazy scenarios, and RE3R just being a lazy cash-grab in general, my initial impressions for this game weren't the most optimistic, but my God, what's here absolutely blows me away and has done so since I got it on PS4/PS5 in March and continues to impress me now I'm on PC.

• Optimisation is glorious, the RE engine continues CAPCOMs black magic that we saw with MT Framework. It ran great on my PS4, it ran amazing on my PS5, it ran insanely well on my RX 7800 XT PC.

• The visuals are superb, some of the best in the industry at the time of writing.

• Replay value is top notch, with a slew of unlocks, challenges and the ever-addicting ranking system to keep you coming back for more to improve your times and performance.

• Gunplay. This is some of the most satisfying shooting in any 3rd person shooter. It's no Max Payne 3, but it's close, and Leon going full John Wick Mode on Ganados never, ever gets old. 

• Music. A negative of RE2R and RE3R was the muted, at times nonexistent soundtrack. RE4R delivers in spades, with remixes of the classic 2005 OST and its own new, chilling and blood-pumping ensemble of tunes.

• Fully rebindable controls. This may not matter to some, but to me, this is the hallmark of a game which respects the player's desire to tailor the experience.

• There are moments which genuinely reward and respect the player's thinking, something most modern games shy away from out of fear of a player experimenting. A concrete wall blocks your path? You can either go through a scripted battle lasting 5 minutes, or hit the wall with two Heavy Grenades and watch it crumble as soon as the battle starts.  Know an enemy will ambush you? Throw a grenade before you trigger the cutscene and watch as the enemy blows up in the cutscene, allowing you to progress.  Don't like that barricade blocking your path but don't feel like slogging through the mines for some TNT? Whip out your rocket launcher and just blow it out the way.  Don't want to go all round the castle battlements to open shortcuts? Carefully aim your gun or a grenade through the grates and you can break switches and levers early, and the game will never once punish you for it.  If you can think of it, RE4 may very well let you do it, and at some points the game even accounts for this: I killed a duo boss fight 'early', and in the resulting cutscene of an ally coming to your aid, he expresses surprise and an awkward feeling of uselessness that you'd already taken out the boss without him.   CAPCOM respects your time, respects your choices, and it creates what's pretty close to a Sandbox-like game even though it's a linear TPS.  I just can't gush enough about the freedom this game gives you if you engage with its systems.

• Story. CAPCOM will never be Citizen Kane tier writers, but what's here is solid. Caricatures and empty vessels from the 2005 release are now full-fledged people, with superb vocal performances, enthralling backstories and incredible motion-capture. They somehow made escorting Ashley actually fun this time. 

• Length is perfect. This can either be a 16-20 hour experience for a blind completionist, or a 3 hour evening romp through your hundredth playthrough because you just want to try out a new weapon loadout, see new ways to take on a boss, or just to get more of that glorious gunplay which is at the forefront of the free downloadable Mercenaries mode, which is its best iteration since RE5's Mercenaries Reunion from 2010. 

• Minimal bugs. In my time on 3 different platforms, I've only encountered one bug where an enemy in the Water Hall part of the Castle had lost his pathing and ended up in the actual water below, but this didn't impede my progress at all. It made me laugh, actually.

There were vocal critics decrying 'cut content' when this game first released in March of this year, but without delving into spoiler territory, EVERY. SINGLE. BIT. that was 'cut' actually appears in the Separate Ways DLC, which also EXPANDS upon it all, and I highly recommend that DLC too, as it's one of the best we've ever gotten, so far removed from the short retread campaign in the 2005 version that it could easily have been sold as its own spinoff game.

A 10/10 doesn't do this justice. This is one of the best remakes ever made and one of the best games ever made, period.  In a year (2023) of absolute bangers, I still would've nominated this for GOTY. RE4R is CAPCOM at its very best, and I'll be buying RE5R on day one and hope this template is kept for all future RE titles.  I only wish RE3 Remake had been half as good as this, Jill Valentine deserved better.",1702510151,1702510595,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
The iconic survival horror masterpiece, Resident Evil 4, has been resurrected in stunning fashion with the release of the Resident Evil 4 Remake. Developed and published by Capcom, this remake breathes new life into the 2005 classic, bringing Leon Kennedy's harrowing journey to rescue the President's daughter to a new generation of gamers. Released on various platforms, including Steam, the Resident Evil 4 Remake offers a fresh perspective on a game that defined the survival horror genre.

Graphics and Visuals:
The visual overhaul in Resident Evil 4 Remake is nothing short of breathtaking. The environments, characters, and horrifying creatures have been meticulously redesigned with high-resolution textures, detailed models, and modern lighting effects. The eerie atmosphere of the original game is retained, but the updated graphics elevate the horror to new levels. From the haunting village in the opening scenes to the foreboding castle and beyond, every location feels both familiar and eerily unfamiliar in this visually stunning recreation.

Gameplay:
Resident Evil 4 Remake stays true to the core gameplay mechanics that made the original a groundbreaking title while introducing some refinements for a modern audience. The over-the-shoulder perspective, introduced in the original RE4, remains intact, offering a balance between tense, deliberate combat and heart-pounding action sequences. The controls are responsive, and the aiming feels more intuitive, ensuring that players can fully immerse themselves in the intense combat situations.

New features, such as improved enemy AI and additional areas to explore, add depth to the overall experience without straying too far from the source material. The classic inventory management system has been updated, streamlining the process while retaining the tension of resource scarcity that defines the survival horror genre.

Story and Atmosphere:
The gripping narrative of Resident Evil 4 remains largely unchanged in the Remake, but the updated visuals and voice acting contribute to a more immersive storytelling experience. Leon Kennedy's journey through a mysterious European village plagued by a sinister cult and parasitic organisms is as captivating as ever. The atmosphere is enhanced by the haunting soundtrack, ambient sounds, and the chilling encounters with grotesque creatures that lurk around every corner.

Attention to Detail:
The Resident Evil 4 Remake demonstrates a commitment to preserving the essence of the original game while paying meticulous attention to detail. Character animations, environmental storytelling, and subtle visual cues all contribute to a cohesive and immersive world. Die-hard fans of the original will appreciate the nods to iconic moments, while newcomers will discover a game that feels both timeless and contemporary.

Conclusion:
Resident Evil 4 Remake is a masterclass in how to modernize a classic without losing its soul. Capcom has succeeded in revitalizing one of the greatest survival horror games of all time, delivering an experience that pays homage to the original while offering a fresh and visually stunning take on the beloved classic. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, Resident Evil 4 Remake is a hauntingly beautiful journey that reaffirms the franchise's status as a powerhouse in the survival horror genre.

The basic game is excellent, good plot and narrative, good music and sound effects, good basic gameplay, excellent level design, lots of content... what's not to like, you might think...

All the above ingredients for an excellent AAA game are ruined by a large number of inconsistencies that annoy to no end:
[list]
[*] Abysmal stealth. There are a few areas that clearly expect stealth, others were stealth seems an option - but stealth mechanics are inconsistent and frustrating.
For some scenes, you definitely expect to be spotted - but you are not. And then others were one is spotted early on without clear reason why. The fact that you can only watch over the right shoulder and not switch to the left also makes some stealth movement cumbersome to near impossible.
[*] Bolts #1: This is an ammo scarcity game. As such, the bolt thrower with its recoverable ammo is key. However, recovering bolts is highly inconsistent.
Bolts will stick to walls/objects and should be recoverable - but some are not, even though they seem to be in range for collection. No clear rule recognizable. It can happen a lot in some areas, you find out at end of fight. If it happens, you typically need a reload.
[*] Bolts #2: Some shot bolts simply seem to vanish - not recoverable from defeated enemies, while many others are recoverable. It seems random. Reload needed if it happens to much.
[*] Bolts #3: Some enemies ""swallow"" most (but not all!) bolts (not recoverable). You only find that out at the end of the fight. Now you are left near completely out of bolts and you will have to reload.
[*] Bolts #4, general loot: The game uses ""zoned maps"" (activity of specific enemies limited to specific areas). Problem is that zone changes can be located in combat areas. Leaving one zone sends enemies of the other zone back - and often loot (including bolts) gets entirely lost this way. Reload needed.
[*] Sound effects are generally good - but volume/mixing of sound effects is all over the place. Some are by far to faint (including ones relevant for combat).
[*] Prompts to execute close-up finishers are sometimes not working. You move in close to a staggered enemy - and sometimes, the prompt to execute a finisher is not available - often meaning the stagger-timer will expire and you will get hurt significantly, instead.
[*] Storage inconsistency: I can place weapons and first-aid in storage - but no ammo, no health vials, no ingredients, no knifes.
This seems to be a gameplay design choice and thus doesn't rate under ""mess"" - but it is still weird and inconsistent.
[*] Bad design/presentation of weapon extra upgrade. 
Game tells you early on that you can sell weapons and you will get the near entire worth of invested upgrade costs back. 
Well, and then later there an extra (very expensive) upgrade option - for which you will find out the hard way that you do not get back. Inconsistent.
[/list]

The overall game is brilliant - but these inconsistencies really ruin the fun and replace it with annoyance and frustration.

What gets me is that the developers could have easily avoided or addressed most if not all of these issues. Most of these seem down to sloppy programming and careless design. And after all, this is a remake, not an entirely new creation.

Recommended if you are a blaze-of-glory, gun-and-be-done kind of player.
Not recommended if you are a player wanting to take their time and play through all content carefully and methodically.

As a complete newcomer, RE1 rocked, RE2 rocked, RE3 was decent but had some issues, and fortunately RE4 rocked as well. It is rather different from previous games and is the first entry where this series slowly started to transition to far more action-oriented entries. If you approach RE4 with the knowledge that it is more of a hybrid 'survival action/adventure 3rd person horror shooter,' I don't think you'll be disappointed at all though. I am gonna complain about a few things now because it seems they're completely ignored by everyone else:

Even though it's a GREAT game, RE4 doesn't maintain its survival horror-y-ness all the way through. It starts off great in the village and mostly stays great through the castle, with only a few things that feel out of place (Del Lago, El Gigante, and some other fight sequences). However, near the end of the castle though it starts to veer too much into action/adventure for my taste. It's a slow transition, but after a certain point the gameplay gets so action oriented that all tension and horror is gone with a few exceptions. The last few chapters almost felt like another game, especially the island with these punky infected soldier guys (?) and big boss fight setpieces. The game felt a little too long as well because of how the later chapters dragged on. There's not much story development beyond ""save Ashley and escape"" to keep these combat slogs engaging. It took me 20-22ish hours to beat and by the end I was just waiting for things to wrap up, something I didn't feel during 1/2.

I think all of this isn't much of an issue unless you've heard people build up RE4 as the absolute pinnacle of survival horror. I had slightly different expectations going into this because of the overwhelmingly positive discourse I heard over the years. It isn't as much of a problem though - all of its issues pale in comparison to how good the rest of the game is.

The story isn't anything groundbreaking (I don't think you can say that about any of the RE games) but you're really here for the gameplay and the characters. Even though I've been bitching about the gameplay, it is really fun. At the end of the day it is still a Resident Evil game and you're doing everything you expect from one. There are plenty of well-done sequences, decent fights, and fun weapons to use. There are some quality of life issues (can't unload weapons, can't store most items) but they don't get in the way of things that much.

I absolutely loved the main characters and was pretty invested in what happens to them for the whole campaign. Almost everyone in the game felt developed and well rounded with some great performances. Almost... Okay I don't know what the hell happened with Ada but compared to everyone else she sounded so flat, bored, and emotionless. Her voice actor seemed completely disinterested and everytime she showed up my immersion was broken.

As for the villains, RE4 does have some better ones in the series so far. That might not be saying much but ESPECIALLY Ramon was so memorable to me. Mendez wasn't bad and Krauser was at least a funny G.I. Joe action figure dude. The main bad guy Saddler was just lame and forgettable in this. He's barely in the game and when he is he just doesn't many an impression. Nearly all of the regular enemies were unique and impactful. The villagers worked well in their segments, the chainsaw guy and the chainsaw sisters were both properly scary, and I actually liked the cultists and freakish creatures in the castle, though they grew old after a bit. I would have completely written off most of the later sections as crappy if not for the Verdugo and the Regenerador segments.

On a more technical side, I've always been surprised how good looking these newer remakes have been ~and~ how well they run. I didn't have any performance issues or slowdowns running mostly high settings @ 1080p on an Nvidia 1080. Like the remakes for 2 and 3, this looks, sounds, and plays amazingly. I also hear it works well on the Steam Deck!

...

So Resident Evil 4 is great game in spite of its flaws, but it still was a turning point for the series. Afterwards it moved too far into action/adventure and wouldn't come back to its horror roots until 7. I wholeheartedly recommend RE4 though. My issues with its design are wholly outshone by everything else it did right.",1702271217,1702349910,True,3,0,0.460448950529098511,1,True,False,False

After 18... long... years. FINALLY, CAPCOM, has come back... with the best goddamn Remake i have ever seen, You want to play a real Remake after being slapped in the face by The Last of Us, and Dead Space, claiming to be from the ground up remakes, despite those games having ZERO mechanical changes that made a huge difference, Resident Evil 4 Remake is just as good as it was in 2005, if not EVEN BETTER, sure some people bitch and cry about Ashley being censored, her panties not being out there for the perverted players that just care about that, i mean her voice actress in 2005 was Cindy from Jimmy Neutron so what the fuck is wrong with people, whenever she spoke all i could think of was a children's cartoon so it just put me away from such thoughts, i just imagined Jimmy Neutron was actually the one saving her from danger (which completely ruins the seriousness of that version for me) and secondly, yeah some of the iconic lines from 2005 are missing, but can you really complain when literally EVERYTHING ELSE around the game is just fantastic? The mechanics for Gunplay? FANTASTIC! The Melee system for both knives and kicking, suplexing, stealth killing with knives? FANTASTIC! The Merchant? FANTASTIC! Treasure Hunting for another time 18 years later? FANTASTIC! Everything about this Remake is 100% fucking great and worth the $60 price tag, the deluxe is great if you are a Super Fan as well, If there are things i didn't like about this game, I cannot remember because it was heavily outweighed by all the good this Remake did. And i have to thank god that the Remakes for RE2 and (unfortunatly) RE3 did well because I believe without those, we would have NEVER seen a real Remake of this game. Even if Resident Evil 1 doesn't get a Remake with this New Engine, at least we can all say ""Hey, i was alive long enough to see a Remake for one of the G.O.A.T.'s of gaming"" Now if they can just do right by adding the other things that are indeed missing in the future for this game, i will be a happy man. And for those that are thinking ""You piece of shit, why would you want DLC for this game, i hate you, i hope you die."" How much money have you spent on your favorite titles, and allowed yourself to be cucked by that company watching your wallet get screwed? Exactly, so you can eat me.

Boss fights were some of the best in the series, simple but fun and scripted enough to not feel too chaotic.

The plot has been slightly rewritten, making it much more compelling and leaving obsolete the ridiculous campaign of the original game.

The gameplay is Superb, maintaining the best features of past remakes and adding some very welcome additions to an already great recipe

The Horror is superb, the atmosphere plus the gameplay create what is arguably one of the scariest, most terrifying games in the saga.

The soundtrack is Awesome, it adds to the atmosphere and the horror overall.

RE4 Remake makes RE4 actually good. While the 2004 original felt like a total betrayal to the franchise, being an innovative action shooter with a ridiculous plot and some sparks of brilliance that added to a complete but uneven package.

With that in mind, I was very eager to try the RE4 remake (RE4:Make from here on) and I was delighted with what I experienced. I have just completed my 2nd playthrough so I feel ready to comment.

It is not exaggeration to say that RE4:Make takes everything the original did well and pushes it a level further to give you an even more fun, engaging, and satisfying experience. I really liked the new and improved gunplay: the weapons feel more real and they are very satisfying to use, especially when you score a headshot on a Ganado that's been bothering you for ages. I liked that Ashley's new character looked, sounded, and acted more like a real person and less like an animé fan's impression of what the US President's daughter would look like as was the case in the original. However, the RE4:Make does somewhat tone down the corny, action-flick style elements of the original which helps to give the game a darker and more sinister atmosphere. This matches well with the darker tone that the other Resident Evil remakes have gone for. I also really like how Luis was more fleshed out as a character and we got to spend more time with him, whereas in the original he made a few minor appearances and then died fairly early on in Salazar's castle. 

There are a few things that were not improved or were worse than the original. I felt that some of the voice acting was a noticeable decrease in quality from that of the original. For example, Saddler with how he spoke and carried himself was far more imposing and intimidating in the original RE4 but in the remake, he does not carry the same gravitas when interacting with Leon. On that note, Saddler's appearances in the story are also significantly reduced, to where you only really interact with him in the final parts of the game which I considered a disappointment. I felt similarly about Krauser: his new character just does not have the same gravitas as the original, who I genuinely found threatening until I unlocked the Chicago Typewriter and Handcannon! Furthermore, I felt that Ada's new voice actress could have done better to match the quality of the original, as Ada genuinely sounds like she doesn't care about being there when she speaks and her character's emotions in the voice acting are flatter than a pancake. I do not know if the voice actress was told to do the lines in this way, in which case the fault would be with the writers, not with the actress. I know this point caused a lot of controversy during the game's pre-release and post-release but I must insist that it's a valid criticism and it is an area where the remake does worse than the original, rather than better. Thirdly, I really don't care for the 'small key' system where you need to find these single-use keys to access certain treasures and I felt it was a completely unnecessary feature that served to frustrate the gameplay experience rather than improve it.

Overall, if I had to give it a score out of 10, I would give RE4:Make an 8.5/10. Overall it is an improvement on the original game, though there were some features I did not care for. If you enjoyed the original RE4, I highly recommend you buy this remake and see what you think.",1702120452,1702120452,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A treat for fans of the original and a great modernization of the game that modernized games nearly 20 years ago

Pros:
-Looks great, feels great, sounds great
-QoL changes are mostly welcome 
-Countless rewarding moments for OG fans
-Most of the non-sensible plot events of the OG have been fixed without compromising the story
-Most of the characters feel more fleshed out and performances are top notch, especially from Ashley and Luis
-Pacing feels better than the OG during late game segments
-Still maintains camp where it counts

Cons
-Ada's VA is noticeably awkward. Not sure what kind of direction the VA was going for, but her lines always feel off compared to everyone else
-Hanging cage treasures are practically impossible to discover without opening your map every few minutes, leading to a necessary immersion breaking habit
-Sniping doesn't feel great, as there aren't additional sensitivity options for them and the smooth scope zoom is gone due to control changes
-Merchant/type writer menuing could use some additional QoL adjustments
1. Let me see tune-ups for weapons in storage
2. Let me compare weapons in the buy menu to each other
3. Reflect the exclusive damage perk on the actual weapon numbers 
-You can't spin fully spin attache case items upside down",1679890240,1702106782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The beginning cutscene is short, just a brief recap of Leon's career and the current mission then I'm about to explore the creepy forest path, kudos to Capcom as I hate games that give endless introductions. The third person view looks great, the movement is fluent, shooting and attacking are smooth and like other games, the first 2 chapters are the hardest as you lack weapons and ammo, but the rest are much easier. 

My biggest complaint is player should be given hints when Leon enters the village, the bell rang so late that I thought I missed out key items or had to do certain kills. I don't like the feeling of not knowing what's happening. 

You won't get lost, since most of the time there's only one way, and the way for rewards is obvious and mostly to gain coins. It's fun to explore, visuals are unparalleled but the puzzles are lame, a 5 years could work out 90% puzzles within seconds, it's like copying answers from a classmate sitting next to you, a disgrace to the original games. The shooting feels exciting, the sparks coming from the knife counter are visually satisfying.

Leon needs to protect Ashely during half of the time, the AI is okay - no stupid death nor way blocker, Ashley is defenseless and could be carried away but player has plenty of time to react before a game over. Speaking of gameover, Capcom seems to enjoy making Leon die many ways, the most brutal death might be cut in half from the crotch. Leon makes a boost for Ashly to reach higher places, but when there's a door right next to the wall yet they still do boost, it can't be more obvious something is about to happen. Capcom really can do better about giving surprises.

For characters, Leon is well voiced, yet Ada is a walking machine, a disaster. She can't sound more boring and I don't feel anything for her at all. It decreases the fun to a degree, as Ada rescued Leon so many times but within a dry, dead voice, made her so out of character. Louis and Ashley are good, but I found myself feeling little for Louis when  [spoiler]his moment came [/spoiler], not even after that Separate Way DLC.

But don't take me wrong, besides the downsides RE 4 is a game worth playing, spending the last bullet to take down the last enemy is satisfying, large map and boat driving. There's no jump scares, no walkers play dead on the floor waiting for a bait, the recent RE remakes are different from the originals and becoming a regular action game costumed to gain a bigger players base.

It's a good game I certainly recommend especially on discount, but I don't think it's good enough to be GoTY.

The original Resident Evil 4 from 2005 was already an excellent game, but the remake kicks things up a notch. It fleshes out characters more, adds general quality of life improvements, better gameplay, and it's difficulty is bumped up.

The remake of this game does NOT screw around. Let's use the opening car ride as an example. In the original 2005 game, Leon arrives during the day or afternoon, it's incredibly bright out. In the remake however? Leon arrives during the dead of night, and during your first enemy encounter, the remake throws you for a loop by introducing you to a new enemy type instead of the typical ganado like in the original.

The remake takes no prisoners, it's do or die. Enemies are faster, and far more powerful compared the original, and you will probably get your butt kicked quite a few times on a first playthrough. Smart use of your weapons, melee attacks and the parry mechanic will balance out the playing field, and you'll soon be feeling like an absolute unit yourself once you get into the swing of things.

This game is easily my favorite of all time. An incredible experience that I consider a must play. Amazing gameplay, excellent side content, awesome DLC. It has it all and it's ready to deliver.

This is a faithful remastering of the original game. I have yet to finish the Remaster.
But in every way that the game could be enhanced it has been enhanced, the controls especially.
But not to mention the Graphics are just beautiful like in all the other remasters so far.
They are on Par with the newer games, Biohazard and village.

Overall I honestly have no cons, the game is amazing. If I was to complain about one thing it would be how the character interacts with his weapons and other inventory. It is still as clunky as the original. But this by no means is a deal breaker. 

OVERALL if you are even thinking of buying this then do it ESPECIALLY if you have never played the original, you won't regret it. RE4 is also a great game to get into the franchise as it is very very loosely tied to the other stories. (that doesn't have a positive or negative affect on the game, it just is a fact)

This is a no-brainer. I have never before ""recommended"" a game that was so unanimously liked. Everybody plays the game, everybody completes the game.

A great superproduction as only the Japanese can do it, with a cheesy script about the Japanese idea of an US special agent, who goes to a Japanese idea of a Spanish village, to rescue the Japanese idea of the US President's daughter. Everything here is sacrificed in the name of having fun, and the game is so much fun it's hard to overstate it.

The quality of this remake is unbelievable in multiple aspects. When watching some of the scenery, one just wants to start clapping. This game and SF6 demonstrate the incredible power of the Re-Engine, and based on this I we can expect great things of Dragon's Dogma II.

One last thing: for some reason, Steam warns you of limiter PS5 controller compatibility. I'd say this game is [b]very[/b] compatible with the PS5 controller, including color changing with the health level.

The RE team made a game that is great for new comers and for the seasoned player. For the seasoned players, Resident Evil 4 remake (RE4:RE) tweaks the game mechanics just enough to make us learn new tricks. The dev team knew RE4 fans have played the original to death and know every trick in the book. The dev team managed to use that book against us in a thrilling and meaningful way. There are moments in the game that are genuinely creepy and scary. Moments that make us panic because something from the first game no longer works or is there. This is something I think has been lost over time as the original can seem less scary to more modern eyes and the reputation of the game has be around for so long. The original is perhaps more known its campy moments than its scary one. Those campy moments that are still in the game and do help bring some levity but ultimately take more of a back seat. This game plays things closer to the chest and more straight. Which was a brilliant move. This gives the remake its own identity. It's goal isn't to replace the original. There are very valid reasons to go back and play the original. But the remake is also offering an experience the first game can't offer. It's a joy to play and replay.

First of all, bad TAA implementation. Everything is so blurry and shimmers a lot.

Lastly, no DLSS upscaling. While there is actually a AMD FSR upscaling feature, Nvidia graphic cards literally is the most used graphic card for gaming and they didn't implement DLSS?

All of these issues 

I would gladly accept the these limitation on a smaller and cheaper indie games, but on a $60 AAA games? It's unacceptable.

Pro:
- The game is graphically amazing. Its very atmospheric, with high-quality animations as well. It ran very well on my decently good gaming laptop, which was a nice surprise.
- The combat is really cool. You can tell that the developers put lots of effort in the handling of the firearms, the melee attacks and the grenades. What I find most impressive is how the enemies act when closeby. You always feel like you were cornered, but somehow fought your way out, which is an amazing feeling.
- The enemy variety is excellent. Nearly all enemies have unique ways in which you have to approach them, which really helps with spicing up the combat. 
- There's a variety between combat, fun traversal and puzzles. 
- The companions you travel with are a lot of fun. You miss them when they are not there.
- The DLC is good. Separate Ways is worth the money.
- Bingo

Cons:
- Sometimes, especially during boss fights, you can press E to evade an attack. This will have a pop-up on the screen. However, sometimes you need to parry an attack or simply sprint out of the way. These counters won't really have a pop-up, which can make some boss fights feel like there's no counter to their attacks. I recommend just sprinting out of the way most of the time :)
- I was kinda disappointed that there was no ""chapter replay"" option after you've beaten the game. To get back to a specific chapter you must be lucky to have a save of that chapter, or you must play the game from the start again. I recommend saving at a different save-slot after every chapter.
- I felt kind-of punished for taking a long time to explore during my first playthrough. You get a score for the entire run at the end, and rewards are handed out for a higher score. This made me think to myself: ""If only I had played a bit faster I would've unlocked the funny hat."" Its not a big deal, but be aware of this.

The enemies hardly react to being shot and following a stun with a melee is counterproductive because of tiny hitboxes and enemies attacking before I was released from the animation - much fun, so great design. Playing on professional on the village battle section I wanted to cry - climbing up the stairs and finding shotgun I met HIM - one ordinary villager that I had to shoot 5 times in the head to get rid of - and he kept advancing! Fighting the enemies is a chore - it's a chance if you stun them and then you probably won't go for a kick, since melee is pathetic in this game. That is, if you manage to actually hit them with a bullet - game randomly decides if you miss or not, as it's realistic and exciting to loose your hard-earned resources through no fault of your own - what's not to love there? Unless you buy laser sight, then you magically don't miss, because. The game in general has this 0,5 second input lag, as movement also feels slowed and changing directions is clunky - Leon reacts to imputs with a noticeable delay and equipping an item from the attache case sometimes doesn't register at all. 
That's not to say the game is hard - quite the contrary, it's super easy - both resources and money is abound and the enemy AI prefer to stand around and stare at you, only when you're close do they get aggresive, which since in melee enemies recover sooner than you... But! There's a plenty of defensive options - ducking (doesn't work if they're next to you though) or parying, which is okay, but you parry everything with your knife - a punch, a knife, a pitchfork, a CHAINSAW, a tentacle from the boss. And timing is easy (if you remember 0,5 second input lag), if you know their wind up animations, resulting in boss battles being actually easier and more predictable (and satisfying) than casual skirmishes. Using the knife to throw the off the grabs trivializes getting grabbed, but don't worry all these cool perks have a limit - DURABILITY BAR. Really! Ultimately you're not tested on pure skill in combat, but on enemies' RNG and how often they decide to grab you. Balancing? You can upgrade it to being indestructible once you enter the castle. They knew it was a bad idea!  Once you enter the castle - you've probably gathered enough resouces to buy the exclusive upgrade to your handgun than makes the enemies go down in 2-3 bullets instead of 4-5, and they never get tougher! No more bullet sponges, yay. But oh, no, they knew it was too easy, so the added new type of plaga that is 15-bullet sponge! And a special type of enemy that makes all the ganados get these plagas! Yay!
The village sections, especially Chapters 1&2 are expanded, dragging on and on, castle starts ok, but shrinks quickly and the island is very brief. But don't worry there's backtracking galore, especially if want to find all the treasure (and you have to, to have any gun-fun) and these new side-quests that if not for the money involved in completing them, are a waste of time, since even if they introduce new enemy, they're just tankier version of the one you've fought many times already. But still you have to do them since the treasure is worth 3xless than in the original, but there's 3xmore of it. But guns (and knife upgrades) are even more expensive, so a whole lotta work for a whole lotta nothing, so engaging gameplay. 
And 2-3 guns is fine, 'cos you don't have the room to carry'em, all the precious crafting materials clog your inventory, that is not separate, but crammed in one place.  Don't worry, at the typewritter(!) you can deposit your guns, gun parts, and first aid sprays, but not granades, herbs or ammo. Because, right?
The pacing is all over the place. Or rather, there's no such a thing. There are set pieces. Rising tension, quiet moments - who cares? Definetely not the characters, as they joke and quip every 5 seconds dismissing any notion of a threat to their lives. And so do you! No fear whatsoever. Just a group of college kids sightseeing in Spain! 
The characters are unlikeable, the writing awful, and the word diarhhea that can't stop coming out of everyone's mouths is not only redundant and distracting - it's irritating! 
The rescuing the president's daughter part is the worst part, hands down. Ashley's behavoir is guided by the AI and the commands stay close/far hardly change anything at all. She runs around like crazy, sometimes enemies stubbornly ignore her, sometimes they ignore you and go straight for her to... Stand in a corner with her. No joke. They carry her to reach the wall and stare at it intensely, their back to you, opening them for takedown with the knife. It's a legit strat to let her get kidnapped. One instance I was with Ashley in the garden, all enemies defeated, I aimed at a perched crow... She proceeded to run around me, even straight in front of the gun! 
Yeah, she acted like a headless chicken. And the way she tries to squeeze through a dense group of enemies! If they're not programmed to grab her, she runs at them and ducks at them, everybody rubbing against each other. But in the scripted events or cutscenes they present her as helpful and competent! 
STOP RUNNING IN FRONT OF THE GUN, YOU DUMB @#$%^! 
Capcom couldn't come up with anything better than stop/follow from the OG, so they gave her chicken AI and a cute scripted scene, so she's better now, huh?
Like in RE8 Village. Enemies have a ZONE up to which they will chase you. If, you cross it, they go back to their spawning points. Wish they used their ""Castilian Spanish"" to warn if they're behind me like they used to. Audio cues have been reduced. There's as much soundtrack as there is atmosphere. Thank you for teaching me that truth, Capcom.
Novistadores look like turds and are overused. El Gigante got so big because he grew and ate a lot - the storytelling!
There's shooting range but rewards are random - why bother? 
Boss battles are either schematic or bs aoe attacks. Last boss has hives of Novostadores attacking the player. Tell me he would be a joke by himself without telling te he would be a joke by himself. 
Satus/health icon is too small, you can't tell how much ammo you have left, which impares your actions in combat. 
There's even more QTEs, with game straight up highlighting knife button when you can parry (cool, if only HUD was a little bigger) or flashing big DODGE prompt. 
The try-too-hard bland quips feel jarring in a game that tries so hard to prove that it's mature but forgets to be fun.
Why? Why do games need to be mature? Realistic? Why not immersive? Fun? Unforgettable? We've had Silent Hill 2! Why would we need to prove anybody that videogames are art?  
You basically endure shooting squirt guns as you meticulously save money to buy youself less tedious combat encounters.
Ultimately, the game was lost at its conception - they took the elements that worked, cut out the minor but vital details and added their own ""modernized"" ideas resulting in a soulless Frankenstein monster. 
And the wonderful DLCs. Oh, wonderful DLCs. The ones that for real money give you more than 1 extra costume for your characters? The ones that fix the fetch-quest backtracking galore economy? Those little gems that dropped right after all reviews were in prasing it to high heaven. 
I liked this game at first, has its moments (parying 3 arrows in a row while headshoting 2 other guys) but it became one big meme for me. Shooting is fun in every game, but when it doesn't do anything to the enemies, especially if the game decides I must miss now, why bother? And the migrane-inducing dialogue...
5/10 game. Not too bad, not too good. Average AAA. 
Terrifyingly forgettable (and some things you actually want to forget - looking at you Ashley).
Buy the original, it comes full package - The Mercenaries, Separate Ways, Assigment Ada, 2 extra costumes.

Some of the cons are quite significant. I would not blame people if they were enough to put them off. I was very nervous about playing this game, since the original is so dear to me. It's too different to be a replacement and the original was (mostly) brilliant. It doesn't come up to par overall, but it got far closer than I thought it would.

The bad:
- Content has been cut out for DLC
[spoiler]
- Saddler is hardly in the game now and he is more generic. Quite disappointing, considering how great he was in the original.
- Ada's voice actor is terrible (this can be modded, thankfully). Stilted, cold, no sense of seduction or mystery.
- Salazar is not quite as goofy or involved in a story perspective (his boss fight, however, is a big plus)
- The merchant's voice is not quite as good as the original
- Leon is not quite as much fun.  He still throws quips, but he's played far straighter in this game
[/spoiler]

Now, the good:
- Combat is expanded and significantly harder. Ammunition is scarce and your knife is not indestructible
- Generally feels more like a horror game
- If you are very familiar with the original, certain set piece changes will actively screw with you.
- The map has been changed in ways to make the world make more sense, while still retaining the original atmosphere.
[spoiler]
- Luis is far more involved in the story and game play this time
- Ashley develops more as a character, is more actively involved and even sees this development manifest in the game play itself
- Boss fights are improved across the board to varying degrees. The first encounter with Krauser is no longer a bunch of QTEs, Mendez is expanded, Salazar is drastically altered for the better and Saddler feels more imposing
- Though Leon is not as fun a character, the changes still make sense for the different tone of the game (and you can still suplex). His straighter character actually manifests nicely (ie: actually shooting at people in cut scenes, rather than standing there like a idiot).
- The music has been kicked up a bit and really adds to the tension, particularly for boss fights. Tunes like 'Serenity' are sadly absent, but I found myself searching the sound track on YouTube far more than I thought I would.
- A great example of these positive changes is exemplified in the cabin fight. The music, action, character interaction and the layout of the area really improve it. It was difficult in the original and is even harder here, but it is a definite highlight.
- Though the merchant has a different voice, he is still voiced well and has many more lines.

[list]
[*] Amazing Graphics
[*] Crisp Gameplay
[*] Awesome story
[*] Great blend of horror and action
[*] Difficulty feels perfect (at standard for me personally, but with the addition of an assisted or harder difficulty as well for those looking for such things)
[*] Crafting and inventory management are simple and effective 
[*] Best of the RE remakes so far, and possibly the best Resident Evil game I've played
[*] Seems easy to run compared to most modern titles (3440x1440 with a 2080 super and had consistent frame rates above 60 with higher graphical settings)
[/list]

[b] Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] Controls during intense combat encounters can feel a little clunky 
[/list]

This feels like my favorite of the Resident Evil games as a whole, the franchise has definitely been rejuvenated with these alongside RE 7 and 8 but this IMO has been the best so far. The RE engine continues to impress graphically, the game is absolutely stunning. Much more so than other current titles and yet somehow doesn't put the same strain on my system which is amazing. The gameplay itself is also the perfect blend of horror and action, merging the two without every crossing too much into the territory of the other. 

I can't say anything truly negative about the game, I mentioned during some of the more intense action moments the controls can feel a bit clunky but at a certain point that's splitting hairs. This game is incredible and quickly managed to make it to my top when it comes to some of the best of 2023 and possibly one of my all time favorites. I highly recommend this installment in the RE franchise and frankly all of the other remakes as well (along with 7 & 8). To sum it up the RE4 remake is an absolute must play.

I absolutely love what Capcom has been doing with the franchise as of late and I can't wait to see the next installments and remakes.",1701436777,1701436854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This RE4 (2023) is a remake. The original RE4 popularlized many 3rd person shooter conventions, from slower pacing to the camera angle. Some features were hits, others were misses, and some became commonplace to the detriment of all of us. I'll try to cover what was important from the first game, so we can identify what was preserved and lost in the remake.

Resident Evil 4 came out in 2005, as the last hope of third party support for the Nintendo Gamecube. This is relevant for two major reasons and one conspiracy theory reason. It was designed to be played with a controller, so the demands for precise aim were lower. It was designed to have a rumble pack, and features were added to attempt to add immersion with the controller. My conspiracy theory will be covered at the end.

The GCN controller (Gamecube Nintendo, GCN was the convention, God I'm old) was the most comfortable controller back in the day for people with small hands. If you had larger hands, it was still good. The pacing of the entire game was designed without keyboard and mouse in mind. The remake tries to split the difference, and somehow you need keyboard, mouse, and controller to get the best experience. The best-feeling way of playing the remake is with a controller, with rumble on, and some difficulty tweaks like aiming slowing down when over a target, or even a little autoaim. The remake also has more difficult modes that can only reasonably be played with a keyboard and mouse, like hardcore mode and the target gallery if you want to prioritize twitchy shooting.

The other controller-centric feature of RE4 (2005) was quick-time events (QTEs). Obviously QTEs are bad for humanity, but I think some QTEs actually helped build tension in the original. There are a number of times when Leon is doing something action-related in a cutscene, and either you needed to press a button combination to dodge a surprise danger or press a button repeatedly quickly enough to not fall and die. QTEs with keyboard and mouse don't feel the same, and RE4 (2023) leaves out several big QTE moments from the original. There is a setting to change QTEs to holding a button if you want to save your controller, or you can leave them on and break your controller faster. Either way, something feels lost.

Now the conspiracy theory. Releasing a Resident Evil game on a Nintendo console always seemed like a weird choice, but Capcom was the only company willing to deal with Nintendo's obnoxious hardware. This brings us to what was lost in the remake. The comedy. RE4 (2005) was a campy, funny, scary game in that order. In hindsight, I wonder if the whole comedic slant was to fit the Nintendo platform vibe of cute characters and feel-good games. Regardless of original intention, the conversations between 2005 snarky, emo Leon and pint-sized-Napoleon Salazar were some of the best low-end comedy I've seen in a game. Withiout spoiling too much, the most iconic line ended up being
Salazar: I'm going to send my Right Hand after you.
Leon: Your right hand comes off?
...and Salazar gets cranky and you can almost feel the studio audience laughing. That's what we lost with the remake. The only remnant is various achievements referencing funny dialogue, which is funny itself the first time or two, then just comes off as highlighting the new game missing things. As an aside, the dialogue between the protagonist characters is certainly IMPROVED from the original, and Luis' story arc feels rougher initially, but leaves a stronger lasting impression.

Overall, the RE4make preserves much of the gameplay with better graphics and is playable on more modern hardware. We lost most of the comedy bits, replacing fun interaction with the villains with bland/serious interactions. The controller/keyboard+mouse dynamic feels a little weird, and in a current era with fewer QTEs, QTEs are halfheartedly reproduced for a game that needs QTEs. As previously stated, 9/10 with no original ideas and a more serious tone than the original. It's good, but don't blame me if you play it once or twice then never again.",1701358018,1701358018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Ashleys are different - original was meek but chirpy, new one is fiercer but not as memorable.  Ada gets more airtime in the remake, but the voice - its like they used the worst take possible (ala talia al ghul in DKR).",1701252526,1701252526,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The fundamental flaw with this Remake is that the gameplay is less gun-focused and more knife/parry focused. Unless you want to engage in the knife-centric combat, it's better to just skip most combat encounters. Most bosses can be thwarted with a leveled up Bolt Action Rifle and/or Magnum. The S+ rank is rather easy to obtain on Pro if you just speed-run the game with those weapons and ignore most everything else.

I wanted to engage in some fun shooty-combat like the original offered, but there is so much emphasis on parrying attacks here, it reminds me a lot of RE6's Mercenaries where you would have to counter-attack most enemies in order to get more time. I was not a fan of that countering stuff there, and I am not a fan of it here. I much prefer RE5's Mercenaries as it was basically just more of RE4's gameplay with added melees and the guns were actually useful: they put down enemies and set them up for the wide variety of melee attacks. Here and in RE6, your guns are merely there to just get some chip damage in. It's more about countering.

In terms of positives, there are surface-level things done better:
- Being able to store weapons/parts (but only weapons/parts - it's a not a classic RE storage box; instead more of the Revelations kind)
- Being able to change costumes without having to start a new game.
- Being able to customize treasures for higher selling value
- The Merchant requests (albeit some are overused)
- Knife stabbing is quicker and similar to how Jill stabs in RE5
- The level design for the most part is better paced.
- Exploration is more rewarding with the vastly expanded treasure system.

Overall, it is this weird combo of the evade-enemies gameplay style from the pre-RE4 games, and the more action-focused style of RE4. It does not mix well.

Due to changes in game-play style, this game makes parts that were already chore-like in the original even more so. There are several pieces of fat from the original that should have been cut out, yet most of them return. I am quite frankly shocked that they even bothered to bring back as much of the Island segment as they did. 

As it stands now:
 - The melee system is nowhere near as consistent as the original's which was character-location-based, not camera-location-based.
 - The stealth has been done better in other TPS games as they have better feedback on how actually hidden you are.
- The aiming cross-hair bloom gets quite annoying, and adds more frustration to the combat. Shots will straight up miss when in point-blank range.
- The game states that Hardcore mode is for veterans of the original, but as someone who has played the original on Professional multiple times, I very much disagree. The gameplay style is simply not the same.
- The game's idea of difficulty is just making the enemies take longer to kill and more aggressive to compensate for the new mobility Leon has over the original. Unfortunately, they gimp Leon's mobility to stagger from anything. Simply being nudged by a ganado climbing over a window causes Leon to obnoxiously stagger.
- Ashley's AI commands are worse as there really isn't a huge difference between the two options. She either follows you, or follows you from afar. I don't know why they opted for the RE5 AI Command system, as it is clearly worse than what OG RE4 had (this is by far the biggest example of fixing something that wasn't broken.)
- QTEs are still present, just not in cutscenes, and are dedicated to Right-Stick clicking. And because of the camera-issue with melees, the same problem kinda exists with this although not as bad. 
- Target Practice was made into a grind for charms instead of just being guaranteed them after getting a certain score. Target Practice was already a boring side game in the original, and it should have just been cut. (or better yet, make a new mini-game that actually resembles the gun/melee-centric combat of the original). Not to mention, most charms are useless. Would have been really cool if some charms added electricity/fire/poison to your bullets or melees. Y'know, actual gameplay enhancements, and not just some minor stat increase that's barely noticeable.
- Music-wise, all the songs sound rather generic. The original's wasn't amazing either unless you like listening to eerie atmospheric sounds and drumbeats - [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vhPVZjWH0&t=6s]only one track really stood out[/url] and I don't think it is even in the Remake. If it is, it blended into all the others. The Save theme could be seen as another worth-while track, but it's got nothing on Code Veronica's.
- The story/dialogue isn't anything better than the original. It's about on par, but the voice acting is worse. Either unfitting voice actors, and/or just poor acting/direction/writing in general. If anything, the game is trying to have fun with itself, but it knows that it is copying something else, and it just isn't as good.

I can only recommend it if you download the following mods off of Nexus. These make the combat more enjoyable to participate in and more akin to the original game (as well as adding a bit of QoL enhancements that the Remake should have done).

- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/260]Item crafting multiplier[/url] (more bang for your buck)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/438]Unbreakable Knife[/url] (as it was in the original - gets rid of the dumb middle-man of having multiple knives in your inventory)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/372]Unbreakable Vest[/url] (as it was in the original)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/350]Perfect parrying all the time[/url] (Have to be facing/to-the-side-of the enemies though: a drawback to the parry system in general, and not all attacks are parry-able, which is dumb in my opinion)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/496]Dodge Roll[/url] (double click RS to leap away)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/407]Kick Open Doors/Melee anytime[/url] (set a hotkey to melee anytime - makes combo-ing enemies more fun)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/933]Del Lago in one hit[/url] (one of the bosses that did not need to return in the Remake or at the very least should have allowed the player to use more than harpoons; well, with this mod you can just kill this beast with one harpoon and be done with it)
- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/633]Start with Small Keys[/url] (less backtracking for just a single drawer, especially in the Castle)

As a remake of RE4, I expected a lot better.  I have no wish to play the Separate Ways DLC or really any future content for this game. 
On a different note: I'm glad Konami is not changing much about the gameplay for the upcoming MGS3 Remake because if Capcom's Remakes are anything to go by, you should not fix what wasn't broken, and the original RE4 had little to be fixed other than outdated graphics, some bloated segments, and semi-clunky controls.",1680096293,1701215525,False,42,11,0.480140984058380127,17,True,False,False

I still prefer the atmosphere of RE2 Remake, but I’m glad the horror in 4 is extended throughout the game and not just isolated to the regenerator sections. The original was almost exclusively relegated to action in my opinion. I love action, but compared to RE2, the fourth installment always marked the deviation from what I would call “Resident Evil.”

I’ve played RE4 from the Gamecube days all the way to the present on many different systems. It is a genuinely fun game. My two main complaints are not having VR function on computer and unfortunately Ada’s voice. I can understand timed exclusivity, but I’ve always thought limiting your game to a certain console has been a great way to miss out on sales. As for the voice, I really don’t like commenting negatively about someone’s performance without hearing them in other roles, but the VA for Ada in this game just doesn’t fit.

I wont try to specify too much due to spoilers but its hard to talk about so it'll actually be spoiled anyways so... Like in OG RE4 the Krauser fight I went in with a FULL STORAGE of ammo and spent it all (this is when I was younger) and Krauser would STILL live and win. But this version changed that and I depleted all my knives so I pulled my magnum out as a Hail Mary and Literally killed him in one clip. This was done after COUNTLESS HOURS of fighting him. IDK why in the world they did that but it bothered me in more ways than the traditional. ALSO I don't like that they cut out the U8 fight completely from the game. Yeah in the OG RE4 if you weren't smart with your ammo you would DEFINITELY suffer for it, but I don't think It was THAT HARD to make these kind of changes for the Remaster. Lastly, I prefer the OG RE4 way to unlock the Chicago Typewriter over this one it LITERALLY requires me to become a speed runner because I gotta beat the game under 3 hours or something wild like that and AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT when in OG RE4 all I had to do was beat the game, then beat Separate Ways then I can just buy it (for a humble Million dollars) but at the end of it all I don't have to replay the game 100 times because I have to make this RIDICULOUS ASS TIME just to unlock it and feel the nostalgia fully flow from all the time I played this growing up.

 And as for Separate Ways it was fun but it was also both educating and confusing playing her story like I didn't realize basically her story is going from the CASTLE originally, find Leon then basically make your way back to the castle 'following him' and doing whatever side thing in the meantime (from what I remember). Sheds a little light on it and makes the story seem a bit more dull in Adas aspect.

I absolutely enjoyed this reimagination of the classic RE4. Though I think it was a bit shame that some characters didnt have that much of a shine as in the original (fe. Osmund Saddler). Also I missed those PDA/cellphone (whatever) conversations. Player is now able to move while aiming down sights - that is countered by there being more enemies and them being much more aggresive. Also to me it seems that Leon is moving little bit more sluggish. Story is now taken more seriously, Ashley not being the anoying anime girl sorta being out of place. That can be taken as positive, but also negative - as the remake is missing some of the funny one-liners.

Resident Evil 4 is hands down one of the best remakes to ever be released. Capcom took what was an industry juggernaut back in the day, and made it even better. The gameplay and graphics are out of this world, and the story stays true to the original game while maintaining a wild, improved and deeper spin, especially with the release of the Separate Ways DLC. Speaking of the story, the combination of horror and humor is unmatched throughout any game of this genre. 

Whether you're someone who's a horror game enthusiast, Resident Evil franchise fan, or just looking for a new and fun game to play, I highly recommend this game.",1701155209,1701155239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are quite a few differences from the original. Some changes are improvements whilst others are downgrades. 

[h3]Combat[/h3] 
Combat is better than the original. It is more challenging and engaging compared to the original. The combat loop is great  
and, on higher difficulties, somewhat supplements the missing tension due to the lack of sound design. (More on that later) 

[h3]Story[/h3] 
The overall story follows the same outline as the original, but the tone is slightly darker. It's decent for a RE title. 
The cheesy/goofiness of the original has been mostly removed. Radio transmissions between Leon and the villains have  
been removed. The result is that villains lack most of the original's depth. Some of the older cheesy lines  
are still present. Some of the sillier portions of the original have been removed from the main game and added in part to  
the separate ways DLC. You really should pick up the DLC to get a richer experience. It's worth the price. 

[h3]Ashley[/h3] 
Ashley's characterization is done well. Over the course of the game there is real growth between Ashley and  
Leon. Some of the scripted interactions make her ""come to life"" in the first couple of playthroughs. She does seem to get  
in the way more than the original. I have blasted her on accident many a time. 

[h3]Cinematography[/h3] 
The cinematography is lacking compared to the original. Some of the added detail and storytelling devices that were used in the original cutscenes are missing in this version. 

[h3]Sound Design[/h3] 
The sound design is a real let down compared to the original, except for the shooting gallery song. That's a real banger. 
Quite a bit of the original tension is lost due to the quieter ambient/environment sound. The water hall room is a great example of this. Weapons sound great though! 

[h3]Voice Acting[/h3] 
Voice acting is alright. Except for Ada. You might want to install the ""Ada Wong Voice Replacement Mod"" to address this. 
Really. 
  
[h2]DLC[/h2] 
[h3]Mercenaries[/h3] 
The mercenaries game mode is fun. I prefer the original, but this version is fine. Much better than RE:Village 

[h3]Separate Ways[/h3] 
This DLC is alright. Although the fact that it was not included for free, like the original, sucks. Pricewise it's not too bad for what you get, especially if you like completing the game challenges. If you love the combat loop of the main game, you should pick this up as it supplies more of it. Ada’s voice is still an issue. You might want to wait until the voice mod for this DLC is released. Really.

(Spoilers)This remake has proved itself to not just be a re-skin with different enemies but a fresh experience for the RE community. The new (ish) story from start to finish had me engaged and strapped to my seat, not only did they remove pointless sections of the game like the random floating cage with the centar in it or the random bug areas that made no architectural sense but they improved the story to reflect onto the viewers in a way that just makes alot more sense. The scenery has improved alot and the building actually connect and look like they belong together, not just a simple dirt cave that suddenly leads to a high tech lab. Character development was 1000% better, Luizs death had meaning and you got to engage with him to a point where when he does die it impacts alot harder, id say the same with Krauser. The Gameplay and handling are 1000% better but that's to come with a 17 year difference.

I absolutely adore RE4R and the Separate Ways DLC. So much, that it's become very hard to choose between RE2R and RE4R as my favourite RE game of all time.

Leon, Ashley, Luis and Ada.. their stories are fleshed out so much more than in the original. I love the cheesiness of the original with all the banter between Leon and Salazar and Saddler, but I feel the modern take does the whole story more justice.

Moving Leon around with the modern movement and combat system works much better, the boss battles feel weightier (unless you use the infinite RPG) and the firing range is just pure joy!  Hitting the bonus round always feels so cool with the music kicking in!

There might be nitpicks, but they pale in comparison to what this game turned to be. I was expected a remake like RE3R but Capcom went above and beyond and gave this the RE2R treatment.

I unironically think that this is game of the year. Even if it is a remake and there are some other good games released this year.

Gameplay, plot, graphics, small QoL things starting from menu and inventory. Incredible replayability, especially if you want to beat all challenges. Even mercenaries free dlc is fun to play o/
When i started new game here, i had a feeling that RE2R is still the best, but i was fooled of its coziness in RPD. This part is a masterpiece. Very atmospheric, its hitting your different kind of emotions from the beginning and up until the end. This part broke my heart only because it ended. I wish there would be no RE5, so i could enjoy a little bit more of this chapter of RE lore. I was thinking that beating RE2/3 many times made me obsessed with RE series, but this game lvled up my addiction up to the next galaxy. 20 hours for first run, 80 overall and i didn't touch Separate ways yet.

[b]I highly recommend this game[/b], but it's better to play RE2R before (RE3R could be skipped imo).

While capcom has taken some creative liberties with their retelling of the story and toned down the weirder elements that gave the original such character, the gameplay and graphics are much improved. I liked the newly added stealth and melee elements and the combat flows very smoothly. The gore on enemies has carried over from the other remakes which is nice to see. The soundtrack is decent as well. 
With Ashley and Luis being the exceptions, the characters aren't as interesting as they used to be. Leon doesn't have his iconic early 2000s cocky cool guy attitude, Ada is boring and flat, Salazar's hair is ridiculous, Wesker is a control freak with anger issues instead of a cold and calculating mastermind, Krauser has a nasally voice, and Saddler sounds like a nord from Skyrim.

My experience with the original Resident Evil 4 game is limited; however, with my limited amount of game time in the original game, I actually prefer the remake. I'm aware that this might be an unpopular opinion, but to me this game essentially created a better experience. I'd highly recommend everyone to play this game because it is one of a kind, and it really shows that Resident Evil 4 despite being years old now still has a place in modern gaming.

Pros:
- Amazing visuals and graphics (if you have the specs for it)
- AMAZING controls
- Great storytelling
- Fun relationship dynamics
- Spectacular mechanics

Cons:
- Occasional pacing issues
- Raytracing causes crashes depending on GPU (has never happened prior to this game for me)
- Fuck the rain (AKA optimization in some portions of the game)

Addressing the pros, the graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. It really immerses you into the experience Leon deals with throughout the game, and during any setting the game looks amazing. The only semi-con I have is how demanding the game is; however, as PC components advance, the amount of specs used for modern games is going to increase so it wasn't unexpected. I've played this game between two PCs, one with a 3070Ti and one with a 1070. My 3070Ti can run the game basically at max settings while maintaining 100+ FPS which feels really great. My 1070 can run the game at the lowest settings while also maintaining 100+ FPS. Part of the appeal of this remake over the original for me was the different mechanics. Although I didn't mind standing still and shooting in the original, I could never get used to the camera control and aiming speeds, which made the overall game feel janky. THIS REMAKE FIXES ALL OF THAT. Not only can you shoot while moving, the camera motions and character movement are smooth as butter here. It really shows how a simple change in movement and controls can improve a game drastically. The story and relationship development in RE4 is amazing. The dynamic between Ashley and Leon feels very smooth and natural, and even dynamics between Leon and characters such as Luis feel fresh. Overall, the characters all feel real in the world of Resident Evil. 

For the cons, the game's pacing sometimes feels like it slows down going towards the castle portion of the game. I think my least favorite part of the entire game was the castle because after replaying it multiple times, it just gets tedious avoiding enemies or taking the time to kill them as they usually block the main pathway. Also compared to the other portions of the game, the castle for me didn't make me feel like I was progressing too much. The raytracing issue was a pretty widespread issue from what I saw online as simply enabling raytracing would cause crashes within a couple of minutes of gameplay. I'm 99% sure this is a spec issue as NVIDIA GPUs have considerably less VRAM than AMD; however, it's disappointing that NVIDIA's superior raytracing technology can't handle raytracing in this game. I would have loved to see the differences this setting would have enabled. Lastly, my biggest complaint is the performance during some portions of the game. I'll reference the gameplay that occurs when it's raining because this is when it's the most obvious. The rain just completely nukes my FPS down to 60-70 as soon as you go outside. Even my 3070Ti was struggling and I wish this part was optimized. Now there are settings that reduce the amount of rain which does help; however, even at the lowest setting for it, that's still a 40-50 FPS drop which feels significant as the game stutters during those moments. In fact, many parts of the game have these little stutters where FPS drops, and although they don't happen frequently enough to put me off, it does get annoying seeing my screen stutter even for seconds.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game!",1680930394,1701073697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So when the remake was announced, I was cautiously optimistic, especially after the horrendous RE3 '''remake'''. But my doubts were swiftly put to rest. This game is everything a remake should be. Redesigning and changing aspects of the game without straying far from the classic. Every location in the original is revamped and repurposed, and in my opinion, improved. Good replay value, especially with Mercenaries back. I loved what they did with the shooting gallery, too. As of this review, the only thing 'cut' from the game is the PRL-412. 

Nick Apostolides is a worthy Leon, and isn't trying hard to be like Paul Mercier's version. Krauser's connection to Leon feels genuine rather than the shoehorn it was in 2005. His boss fight is epic. Ashley's character is better, and thankfully not ruined by le woke developers. The only negative thing I have to say is how much I despise Ada's voice. Completely lackadaisical voice acting. Ada voice actress from RE2 Remake was really good. Why didn't they recast her?

If you're a fan of the original, you'll appreciate this remake, even if you think remaking this game was unnecessary.

I must say though that I miss the campy back and forth video calls between Leon and the villains, since it made their inevitable smack down all the sweeter (and set them up as more than cardboard cutout villains without character). Also the fact that while shooting the speaking tube when Ramon is talking is now possible (not just a cut-scene like in the original), Ramon doesn't care and just laughs. Considering he got so mad about it in the original that [spoiler] when Leon is dropped in the pit and survives, shooting the speaking tube to mess with Ramon in the cut-scene, Ramon sends Verdugo down to kill Leon (since it also let him know Leon survived the fall)[/spoiler].

[i]""Over here, stranger.""[/i]

This remake is a masterpiece! From the suspensful scary beginning to the action-packed craziness in the end. Definitely a GOTY in my book.

To start things of, I like this remake the most of the 3. I'm a huge fan of the more action-like approach. I wasn't very keen on all the puzzles and backtracking in RE2R and RE3R was just a bit short for my taste - but that's just a fact.

I haven't played the original RE4, so I'm gonna talk about the remake as a completely new game (to me).


[b]- Story -[/b]
Six years have passed since the biological disaster in Raccoon City. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the survivors, tracks the president's kidnapped daughter to a secluded European village, where there is something terribly wrong with the locals...

The story is very well paced. Your placed in Leon's shoes as you uncover the truth about what this strange place you're currently on is and what happened here... And of course there's Ashley.


[b]- Characters -[/b]

[i]""Where's everyone going? Bingo?""[/i]

All characters are very well written. They feel human, showing their emotions - telling jokes, acting frightened, having sincere dialogues between each other. And of course they are many great and badass one-liners!
Ashley and Luis went through a great upgrade from what I've seen from the original. To all those Ada haters, just get over it. Her voice is completely fine.


[b]- Gameplay -[/b]

[i]""Gun rhymes with fun for a reason, stranger!""[/i]

The gameplay is once again more action packed just like RE3R. Well except there's no slowmotion this time around. Gun play feels good and the best of all is the balance of every single weapon. Capcom managed to hit the nail right on the head. It just feels so good to switch the weapons around and really have fun with them... Yes even the TMP. Even though I'm personally a sucker for the Red9. The only inconvenience I can think of is there is no dodge button, but I get that the game would be too easy with a parry button AND a dodge button. It's just that it sometimes feels weird that running away from enemies is the only ""dodge"" movement you can do.

[u]Resident Evil 4 Remake is truly one of the best games I've ever played.[/u]


[hr][/hr]

[h2]Separate Ways[/h2]

I LOVED playing through this DLC. The way it ties parts of the main story together is just amazing. I already did multiple playthroughs as I really enjoy it. Another great thing about this exceptional remake!

The remake of this game has surpassed my expectations and stands as one of the finest games I've played to date. The game's visual innovations have breathed new life into the characters I must commend the developers for capturing the essence of the original while delivering a more epic experience, especially with Luis, who has truly exceeded the old benchmark.

However, there is one aspect that has garnered complaints from many players, and that is the portrayal of Ada Wong. While the voice actor did a commendable job, some found the delivery to be overly emotionless. Ada's character is known for her cold personality, but it would have been more effective to have subtle variations in her tone to bring out the depth and complexity of her character.

As for Ashley, well, I won't comment on her . But overall, the game is truly incredible. The changing maps and diverse atmospheres provide a sense of dynamism and keep the gameplay engaging. Beware of cunning enemies, especially when playing on the pro difficulty, as mastering parrying will be essential in tight corners or during intense chase sequences.

When it comes to equipment, I highly recommend focusing on upgrading your blade . In my personal opinion, the Red 9 pistol and the TMP as an SMG are worthy investments. Upgrading the TMP to its maximum capacity grants a 1.5x boost in power. Obtaining the Killer 7, and the cat ears will give you unlimited ammo, allowing you to complete achievements comfortably.",1684688912,1701020572,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It feels like you're playing the original game. But it's different enough so that it feels like a new experience. Eventhough you know how the story will play out, you still get thrown off here and there. This makes it feel as a new fresh experience.

I see no more reason to recommend other people to play the original RE4. The controls are dated and it doesn't bring really anything to the table that the new remake doesn't do better. RE2 and 3 I still recommend the originals as they're vastly different experience than the remakes. But for 4 this is not the case at all. 

Graphics and performance are as we are used to from RE2 and RE3 remake => no complaints and only praise.

After the lackluster, but still enjoyable, Resident Evil 3 remake, fans were scared when it came time for Capcom to remake Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 (2005) is often considered one of the best games ever released, so the expectation was quite high.

Having played both that one and this remake, I feel comfortable saying that:

Resident Evil 4 (2023) is even better than Resident Evil 4 (2005).

Yes, there are some changes. Yes, you might disagree with me. But there is no doubt in my mind that this remake is, overall, a more complete and polished game. If you liked the original, you'll love the remake. If you've never played the original, you'll also love this one. The RE Engine is beautiful, and with it, they managed to make an already good, tense game into an even better, more tense (and now actually scary) game.

It took me 18 hours to beat the main story (Normal difficulty), and that is coming from someone who's played both the original and all the other Resident Evil mainline games. If you buy this game for 60$, that's around 3.33$ per hour, on just the first playthrough. The value of this game is insane, DLC included (extra 10$).

⠀Full review:

⠀Pro:
⠀⠀- Breathtakingly beautiful graphics. I stopped many many times
⠀⠀⠀to enjoy the view and take tons of screenshots during my first
⠀⠀⠀playthrough.
⠀⠀- Great implementation of new sidequests. They are refreshing,
⠀⠀⠀quickly done and usually do not require any backtracking at all.
⠀⠀- Quicktime events are gone. I'm happy about this hange,
⠀⠀⠀because I usually am against OTE's and they don't really
⠀⠀⠀contribute to better gameplay. The only QTE I was missing is
⠀⠀⠀when Leon falls into the water during a certain fight in the
⠀⠀⠀original and tries to swim back tothe boat to stay alive.
⠀⠀- Strong emphasis on knife gameplay. This is the biggest
⠀⠀⠀changeto the original RE4 (2005), Capcom went high risk
⠀⠀⠀and high reward and guess what, they nailed it. Parry,
⠀⠀⠀perfect-parry, break out of grab, stealth kills, durability on main
⠀⠀⠀knives, consumable little knives, two different knife attacks.
⠀⠀⠀I love how the entire game is designed around this mechanic
⠀⠀⠀and it carries an even bigger impact on higher difficulties if
⠀⠀⠀you're not using special weapons, that is.
⠀⠀- Shooting Range. The shooting range is still in the game and
⠀⠀⠀as fun as it was in the original game. This is so freaking cool,
⠀⠀⠀it is insane, an absolute loveletter for RE4 fans (thx Capcom
⠀⠀⠀<3). We are facing pirates and sailors instead of Ashley and
⠀⠀⠀villagers this time around. I have to admit that during my
⠀⠀⠀playthrough of the game I had to change to mouse and
⠀⠀⠀keyboard to get S ranks, all skulls and 3 additional stars in all
⠀⠀⠀of them. It would have been impossible to get those stats with
⠀⠀⠀my PS5 dualsense controller. It was very well balanced for
⠀⠀⠀mouse and keyboard and very enjoyable. I don't know how I'd
⠀⠀⠀think about this when I was stuck on a console with a controller
⠀⠀⠀as my only input device and no options to use mouse and
⠀⠀⠀keyboard. It might have been a rather miserable experience
⠀⠀⠀since keep in mind, you are not just getting bottle cups and
⠀⠀⠀pesetas as rewards, you're getting game altering attachments
⠀⠀⠀for the main game. Attachments such as better healing, higher
⠀⠀⠀selling values, cheaper tuning and even +8% movement speed
⠀⠀⠀with the Striker attachments. So yeah, in my book the shooting
⠀⠀⠀range is a huge plus but I can understand people disliking it for
⠀⠀⠀being brutally difficult with controllers.
⠀⠀- Exceptional music delivery, always fits and strengthens the
⠀⠀⠀atmosphere the game is trying to deliver to the player.
⠀⠀- Ambient sound. Sound effects are easily distinguishable. I got
⠀⠀⠀15 out of 16 Clockwork Castellians during my first playthrough
⠀⠀⠀by just listening to the ambient noises. Amazing gun sounds,
⠀⠀⠀as someone who has heard many actual guns get fired in real
⠀⠀⠀life, oh boy, they've out-done themselves with this one.
⠀⠀⠀Directional audio is also amazing, you can hear snakes rattle
⠀⠀⠀or fish swim exactly where they are located during that time.
⠀⠀- Detailed and rich animations. Every encounter has great
⠀⠀⠀fluidity and is very responsive, which adds up to every second
⠀⠀⠀of fights being fun and not feeling repetitive or boring at all.
⠀⠀⠀The way enemies lose their arms, legs head and even get cut
⠀⠀⠀in half looks great.
⠀⠀- Convincing voice acting, believable conversations.
⠀⠀- The user interface is well thought out and has a modern, crisp
⠀⠀⠀look to it. The UI gives you all the information you need on a
⠀⠀⠀surface level but if you need more, you can deep dive to
⠀⠀⠀check for exact weapon stats and descriptions, for example.
⠀⠀⠀It is not overloaded at all. The attention and love they've shown
⠀⠀⠀to detail is fascinating. Or another minor thing, when you buy a
⠀⠀⠀weapon but have to re-arrange your inventory to make space
⠀⠀⠀for it, you just simply press the auto-sort button and the
⠀⠀⠀weapon moves from the side window directly into your
⠀⠀⠀inventory. Love it.
⠀⠀- More screentime for important characters.
⠀⠀- Vastly improved storytelling/narrative.
⠀⠀⠀(won't spoil anything here ofc)
⠀⠀⠀- One-liners and goofy humor. I'm glad they've kept this in the
⠀⠀⠀game. It is not over the top and doesn't appear neither too
⠀⠀⠀frequently nor too infrequently. Perfectly balanced if you ask me.

⠀Con:
⠀⠀- Dog's got bad AI, makes it not as impactful and
⠀⠀⠀fulfilling/challenging as it could have been. For example,
⠀⠀⠀villagers are faster, smarter, charge quickly towards you in
⠀⠀⠀Hardcore/Professional mode. Dogs are the same on all
⠀⠀⠀difficulties, just with a tiny bit more HP it seems.
⠀⠀- Missing a boss. I actually enjoyed this boss fight in the original
⠀⠀⠀game a lot and was wondering in what shape or form they
⠀⠀⠀could have changed this one to make it more enjoyable. It is a
⠀⠀⠀bummer, BUT it doesn't take too much from the overall
⠀⠀⠀presentation of the game.
⠀⠀- Awesome Remake but nevertheless, still just a Remake.

├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

⠀Final thoughts:

⠀⠀⠀RE4 (2005) came out 18 freaking years ago and was state
⠀⠀⠀of the art back then. The current version is state of the art in
⠀⠀⠀2023 and definitely not a cashgrab by Capcom. It totally
⠀⠀⠀deserves to ask for full price or for more if you purchase a
⠀⠀⠀deluxe edition to further support these Remakes. If you'd give
⠀⠀⠀me RE4 (2005) and the Remake today, somehow erase all my
⠀⠀⠀memory related to RE4 and tell me to play both for the first
⠀⠀⠀time and then judge which one is better, it would obviously be
⠀⠀⠀the Remake. It is not a perfect Remake, but it is definitely the
⠀⠀⠀better experience nowadays, by a lot. Nevertheless, I judge
⠀⠀⠀the games I have played for the time they are being released
⠀⠀⠀and never changing that score. RE4 (2005) remains to be,
⠀⠀⠀my 4th best gaming experience I have had in my entire life,
⠀⠀⠀with a score of 99%. The Remake is a masterpiece through
⠀⠀⠀and through with 96% but it has not impacted me as much
⠀⠀⠀as the original game.

⠀⠀⠀Thank you Capcom soooo much for delivering another
⠀⠀⠀remake worthy of being called a masterpiece after RE1
⠀⠀⠀Remake for the Gamecube and RE2 Remake in 2019.",1680869702,1700988172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

_________________________________________
This review is'nt for the weak who think dlc is required to buy! (IT'S A CHOICE)

I played the original to death and all over again!
What can I say about the remake!? It's a masterpiece and it far exceeded my expectations.
It mimics the original environment very faithfully and added some extra details, I really like how some parts were joined to other parts that were to small to be by their self.

Would I say it replaces the original!? NO (you cannot replace the charm the original had)
If you played the 2005 version back in the day then you will love the remake, or even playing the remake and
had never played the 2005 I would say you will love it if you are a true Resident Evil fan...

This revamped version still promises an abundance of laughter and absurdity to satisfy our delightfully dark souls.

the use of modern technology such as motion capture gives more life to our beloved characters from 18 years ago. each character’s modelled after real life actors, designed and animated to move like real people. realistic animations making character movement natural and fairly believable. leon’s character has got more depth in him. leon has got more personality to him now. the silliness of the original leon is still intact while depicting some wacky lines word for word from the original game while adding layers of solemness to him. I appreciate ashley’s new design, she embodies a 20 year old college student this time around and all around is a more amiable character. luis is much more charismatic now, he’s got more screen time this time around, he’s got more depth to his character and he makes every appearance worthwhile. luis’s additional screen time is a warm welcome and gives time to really flesh out his character allowing better utilisation of the character which is something the original struggled with. I prefer ada’s 2019 design over the current one but the character‘s still there.

the combat is satisfying and fulfilling. parrying is a key feature of the game and it’s done perfectly. it’s not completely exploitable as the “parry” icon’s barely noticeable along with the timing which can be a tad bit tricky while being ambushed. leon’s roundhouse kick feels like a cannon and I’m here for it. parrying can allow stunning enemies which can be followed by a melee attack, the roundhouse kick which never gets old. enemy variety is fair, all signature enemy types have been brought back better than ever with the addition of a new enemy type consisting of two variations. the removal of quick time events is a graceful addition to the remake, quick time events don’t click well with modern games. every weapon from the original game is practically here with the addition of new weapons such as the bolt thrower. the pistols serve their job, the shotguns feel heavy, the absurd rocket launcher’s here. around 14 hours of quality gameplay, I profoundly recommend this game.

edit: here after finishing separate ways. separate ways is as polished as the entirety of the base game. for the mere price of $10, we’re getting a new adventure that feels more complete than the 2020’s resident evil 3. separate ways gives more insight on the story of resident evil 4 from ada’s perspective which enhances the resident evil 4 experience as a whole and ties in every piece together. ada’s appearances could feel unjust at times for the base game, separate ways gives depth to ada’s character and shows her humane side rather than this bad-ass character that shows up when pleased. ada’s overall a very charismatic character to play as. separate ways allows you to utilise ada’s grapple gun to traverse huge heights or escape ganados while being overwhelmed. additionally, you can rip shields off enemies and do melee kicks from large distances via the grapple gun. all in all, remarkable add-on. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1679893707,1700940216,True,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

[u] TLDR [/u]
I've pre-ordered the deluxe edition, and played it from start to end. Did i regret it? Definitely not! RE4R is very faithful, and overhauls the story to be better than the original. It is not without its faults though, eventually the game likes to get a bit too combat heavy, but those situations are rare. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Resident Evil 4 Remake is similar to its original, shoot, run, collect items and see more of the RE4 world. If you haven't yet played the original, I'll explain it to you. RE4R has you shoot ""zombies"" in a third person perspective, all the while being careful of your ammo, health and weaponry. Nothing is unlimited in this world, sometimes you have to make choices and ensure you spend your money well.

[b] Story [/b]
Resident Evil 4 Remake is similar to the original Resident Evil 4. You are Leon Kennedy, years after the events of Resident Evil 2. You are no longer an inexperienced police officer, you are now a military man who knows how to shoot and survive. He gets tasked to finding the president's kidnapped daughter: Ashley Graham. Along the way, he uncovers a plot that could devastate the world.

[b] Graphics [/b]

Most settings were set to low - medium, and I've got to say, it ran well! With an average of 60 fps at 1080p, with it frequently dropping to around 30 or 40 on 1080, the game still looked beautiful. In short, be sure to have a modern specifications, as otherwise you might not be able to play this. 

[b] Sound [/b]
RE4R has some great sound. Guns sound like they should, the sounds of the enemies make it clear to me which is which, and I am able to tell where the enemy is coming from. One strange decision: 3D audio is related to your Windows settings. For me, that means the only choice I had was Windows Sonic, which has a very tinny sound. In short, sound is great, 3D sound isn't.

[b] Compared to previous instalments [/b]
I shall compare RE4R to two games. Resident Evil 2 Remake, and the original Resident Evil 4.
Compared to Resident Evil 2, graphics is vastly improved, however, that ""survival horror"" feeling has sadly disappeared. This isn't perse the fault of the game, but a fault of how the original Resident Evil 4 operated.
The original Resident Evil 4 was more action focused, and the horror was killed off due to it. Compared to the original, the Remake definitely surpasses it. 

[b] The Good [/b]
- Great gameplay
- Amazing knife system (Parry and combat)
- Great sound
- Great graphics
- Fast loading times (Even on a HDD)
- A great selection of voice cast

[b] The Mixed [/b]
- Performance is a bit iffy for non-modern systems.
- Too combat heavy in my opinion

[b] The Bad [/b]
- Different Ada voice actor who isn't as good as RE2R
- Loss of survival horror
- You can not return to previous areas between chapters

[b] Conclusion [/b]
Resident Evil 4 Remake's quality is wonderful, it sets the standard and I hope other AAA games follow to be atleast as good or better than this game. I do not regret spending 70 euro, and I hope you do not regret it either. If you're still doubting, there's a demo!
I rate this game a solid 8.5 out of 10.

Blow off an enemy’s head if you want them dead immediately; shoot their hands if you want them to drop their dynamite; or blast their legs while they’re running at you to stop them in their tracks. You can even shoot projectiles out of the air! 

Weapons are well thought out and tightly balanced. Each weapon type excels in different scenarios, as they vary in characteristics like stopping power, wince, break, and raw power. This isn’t a brainless run-and-gun as you’ll need to constantly think about which weapon to carry with you due to limited inventory space.

Overall, I’m still enjoying RE4R a lot even after completing two playthroughs. It has high replay value with its free Mercenaries DLC, challenging game modes and achievements. You can also unlock extra bonus content like new weapons and accessories that give you in-game perks. No two runs are the same despite having set pieces in the game; enemy AI is somewhat random and unpredictable, as their behaviour changes depending on what you do as a player.",1700929108,1700929108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 4 doesn't play like a lot of other games I've played, sometimes the winning strategy isn't to shoot, kill and blow up every enemy even if you have the option to, a lot of the time I'm running past or sneaking by enemies trying to get to a better location.  However, I think that was one of the things I enjoyed most about the game, you had so many options on how to deal with an encounter.  In addition, I loved just looking around the map trying to find every single piece of treasure, crafting material, and bullet.  In my opinion, Resident Evil 4 rewards exploration and is challenging to the player while still being fair.  

I have no previous experience with the resident evil series, but after completing Resident Evil 4 I can say that I will be looking forward to playing more Resident Evil in the future.",1700927737,1700927925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
