[h3]Engaging Story and Open World:[/h3]

The narrative, starting with a helpful tutorial academy, unfolds across open-world chapters divided into manageable segments. Players can tackle these sequentially or simultaneously, fostering a sense of freedom. Exploring these rich environments, with their captivating side quests and intriguing plot twists, is truly rewarding.

[h3]Minor Drawbacks:[/h3]

The lack of scaling difficulty within segments can be problematic. For instance, Chapter 1 recommends starting with the Peninsula, while the Docks, although technically accessible from the start, presents a more significant challenge. Additionally, the voice acting, primarily reserved for key characters, necessitates reading most dialogue boxes. While this encourages attentive reading, it can detract from the immersion. Finally, repeated playthroughs can feel repetitive unless players experiment with different approaches or take breaks to avoid burnout.

[h3]Dungeons & Dragons and Beyond:[/h3]

The game leverages the deep and intricate mechanics of the D&D system. Even though my experience is limited to casual play, I've been able to grasp the core mechanics and gameplay loop well.
Notably, it offers a powerful module creation tool, empowering players to craft their own adventures. Despite releasing in 2002, the visuals hold up remarkably well.

[h3]Multiplayer:[/h3]

The multiplayer experience, just as I remembered from childhood, is fantastic. Setting up lobbies and seamlessly connecting with friends across continents is a breeze. Our only problem involved losing a crucial key due to character saving issues, leading to a soft lock. Fortunately, the presence of a Dungeon Master (a player with administrative capabilities, including NPC control and dialogue, and enemy spawning) allowed us to recover and continue the adventure. This feature, responsibly used, can significantly enhance gameplay.

[h3]In Conclusion:[/h3]

For anyone captivated by fantasy, roleplaying, or medieval adventures, Neverwinter Nights is a must-play. It truly shines in its exceptional multiplayer mode, making it a fantastic choice for friends looking to embark on a shared journey.",1708989601,1708989601,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There's just not much meat on the bone here sadly. The areas are empty and bland, companions feel like little more than mechanical bystanders, and the story is serviceable but certainly nothing gripping either. 

But the big thing which killed the experience for me was the combat. It's just so straightforward and easy, that the game essentially plays itself. Tactics are barely required beyond setting up your character, and it all just felt a bit too auto-piloty for me. 

Neverwinter Nights sits in that awkward early-3D era bracket where it hasn't the chops of it's predecessors such as Baldur's Gate 2 (nowhere near in fact), but it's also very dated when compared to more recent games such as Dragon Age: Origins too.

Allow me to break it down with pros and cons.

Pros:
-Epic music by Jeremy Soule, also known for his work on the later Elder Scrolls games and Icewind Dale
-Even without extra DLC, there is quite a breadth of adventure to be found with the default campaigns and expansions alone
-Many class and race combinations can be mastered and each playthrough can be different each time a player goes through an adventure
-You can make your own adventure campaigns and even use them for multi-player campaigns if you're so inclined

Cons:
-The graphics were very ugly even for a game in 2002
-The engine and gameplay can come off as hopelessly dated and kind of janky to interact with
-Minor tweaks and graphical updates can't really mask how ugly some parts of the game can look
-Due to the nature of the Aurora engine, even modern computers may sometimes experience performance drops during certain parts of the game's campaigns
-There isn't as much depth in terms of choices as there could have been, with the player being essentially useless in preventing some particular events from happening
-Even with the largest UI text size enabled, on a 1080p display it's still possible to come across some small, pixelated or blurry text

Would I recommend Neverwinter Nights?
I would say yes, obviously, but I do feel like a bit more could have been done to truly bring it into the next generation of systems.
That doesn't diminish what's on offer, but it also doesn't give it much extra value.
The additional campaigns on offer for this new version of Neverwinter Nights, though?

At first, it was a fun way to pass 5 minutes while waiting for the campaign map to load after battles, but before long I was playing this and leaving the other, modern game in the background.

The story of the first module is pretty weak but easy to follow and even fun if you can just take joy in clearing out dungeons and really working hard to keep the story progressing. It's not good per-se but it's easy to follow and there are awesome successes and failures. Like a true, classic RPG, it's the diversions - the unexpected stops along the journey - that make the long road from lvl1 scrub to lvl 100 Mafia Boss so rewarding.

What actually feels good about this game is the ambiance. I noticed this walking through the streets of neverwinter. Instead of music there's a symphony of violence: the quivering voices of frightened people begging for their lives, screaming in fear or pain - the cacophony of large objects, including fellow human beings being beaten and tossed against the floor and off the walls - paired with the chunky-yet-aesthetic world design of the early 2000's at it's banal finest. I was completely immersed: the action on-screen was standard RPG stuff, point-and-klick, kill zombies - but the sounds of people being brutalized within their homes as I rushed through city streets I hadn't quite memorized: that's what stuck with me.

In my 40 hours I have only completed probably 25 - 30% of the main story, and as you may know, that is a very, very small fraction of the content available when you consider the base package comes with 3 sub-modules of very generous length, that most say are [i] much [/i] better than the main model I can reference.

its not the story or the writing or the music. that was all great. it was that they tried to make an RPG out of a Diablo clone with a ruleset that doesn't support either. the world is not interesting, the locations are mostly boring, and there is too much wasted time in back tracking and pointless mobs. 

if you get this game (on sale only) do yourself favor and enable the cheats to instantly deal with the hordes of pointless time wasting mobs and locked/trapped chests. it won't cost you any achievements. every unlock and trap costs 4 seconds each. every swarm of low level enemies is gonna cost a few minutes. your fingers and wrists will thank you. enable the cheats, instant kill the mobs and destroy all chests. there is no satisfaction in suffering through it legitimately, only regret at hours of wasted time. 

the DLC, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark, were actually decent and i would recommend you run through those at least once. you meet a kobold named Deekin in SoU and again in HotU and he's a blast to keep around.",1707010296,1707010296,False,3,1,0.457543671131134033,3,True,False,False

Single player campaign is not great, not terrible. Probably not worth it, as the graphics and the engine are obviously outdated. 
But the persistent worlds (multiplayer servers) are what you're actually buying this game for. Start with the most populated servers to get a feel of the game.

Grind is optional, what you're for is meaningful politics, trade, religious rivalries, Underdark vs Surface big stand-off, piracy on high seas, even romance (pg-13).

I wanted to go back and play a well done implementation of Table Top D&D into a video game - and to me this game was one of the best. You still get all the feels of turns and dice rolling, but blended nicely with instant feedback that video games are designed to give. It's not a replacement for TT D&D, it's different, and very well executed.

I have been lucky that I haven't encountered any issues with this installation either, it works flawlessly for me setup.

Whilst it would be nice to take more modern gaming concepts and put them in here (fully voice dialogue etc.) it doesn't take away from the game...you just have to do a bit of reading to get the full story :)

The game itself is very fun to play, it guides you through everything you need to understand and how to play as well leaving things up for discovery. Do you need to save scum in this game? nope! You can truly let the Dice be the Dice in this game which is great! (I think I honestly spent more time in BG3 loading screen than the game itself hah!)

If you're looking for a TT D&D style video game then this is the game for you. You can learn the concepts of D&D from the comfort of your chair and have fun making lots of different characters - and on this point, this to me is where this game shines. It allows you to Role Play very effectively. Want to be the healing who keeps other alive? Sure, grab a hireling and go forth! Want to be a sneaky thief? Sure, go ahead! The choices are really quite vast.

At first glance, it may be hard to understand why this game is so well regarded, especially when compared to Bioware's previous masterpieces of the Baldur's Gate Trilogy. The first thing you'll probably do is start the main campaign, and probably be bored out of your mind. Nothing's really compelling, the gameplay is kinda clunky, and you'll probably end up just turning the game off after an hour unless you're playing with some friends. This was exactly my first experience with the game... until I clicked that multiplayer button.

The real magic of Neverwinter Nights lies in one thing: user generated content. There's a TON. One look at the server browser and you'll see tons of populated servers, all with their own distinct, custom-built worlds, with a dedicated community in each. Seeing what's possible, you may decide to dig deeper, then find the Neverwinter Vault with hundreds of hours of content waiting to be consumed. Currently, I'm playing a complete remake of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, and thinking about trying out the Diablo remake after. That's how robust the editor can be. Hell, some of these are available from within the game with the new community modules tab, which have a select few featured modules ready to download and play with little hassle. Yes, a lot of these mods are janky, but some of the experiences you get from these dedicated fans can rival anything released in the modern day. 

At its core, Neverwinter Nights is a kinda janky platform for delivering RPG adventures within the dungeons and dragons ruleset, whether that be homebrew stories, tabletop conversion mods, full game remakes, or huge communities roleplaying in Ravenloft or The Forgotten Realms. No other RPG has come close to giving this level of freedom to the community, and I doubt we'll be seeing one any time soon.

What I liked:
- The story of the main campaign is classic but effective.
- The quests vary in quality but are generally enjoyable.
- Lots of build options
- Music by Jeremy Soul, which fits the atmosphere wonderfully well
- Legible 3D, even in the heart of the action
- The additional campaign offers the beginnings of a staging.
- Multiplayer
- The game offers a module development kit that allows players to create their own adventure.

It's the last 2 points in particular that make all the difference with Baldur Gate, and a particular effort has been made to improve the game's functionality.

The 2 campaigns last around 70h+, and you can clearly see its weaknesses over time. There's far too much mindless combat (it feels like a hack n' slash at times), and a lack of direction and more advanced art direction add to the feeling of repetition.

There are a few strange bugs in the remaster: a kind of character clipping, I became invincible in a trap room and I was able to save when I was dead. Reloading a savegame solves these problems.

This game is actually one of the best RPG ever made from the gameplay perspective, and even now it doesn't seem obsolete like some other games.
I might be a bit biased here, because I highly value the design when you are playing as single character, and I don't like when games force you to have party (and usually with ridiculously crippled characters in terms of stats). Because of this I never was able to enjoy Baldur's Gate series or even NwN2. Icewind Dale series is better at least, because there you can choose the number of characters and create all of them as you want, but that games still seem more primitive than this one, even if we talk about IwD2 (which is superior to IwD1).
I won't even compare NwN1 with any game of D&D of 2nd edition, NwN1 is FAR above them gameplay-wise. This game is about various builds and progression, I just like to level up my character and it feels nice, while in games of 2nd edition it's all about rolling a dice like 1000 times at character creation, but after that almost no progression at all (and did I tell already about crappy companions where you can't pick one even if there are dozens? Yeah...)
Another mind-blowing thing about NwN1 is the amount of modules, which are basically a different campaigns. Some of them are even able to let you level uo your character to the full potential. Even in original campaigns you can play for almost 100 hours, but with modules it is just a bottomless rabbit hole. Even though, replaying original modules is still nice, as for me, especially considering a healthy amount of autoleveling and randimized loot, so you can really find what you want for your build. And no matter if you are grinding a lot or not grinding at all, you still finish HotU at 28 lvl, because of dynamic XP gain, which is also nice, so you don't have to worry about grind.
As for builds, I can't even tell how many of them there are. Even if you are powergamer, you can create A LOT of different builds, but you don't have to do that. You can play for example halfling-fighter using scimitar/rapier as two-handed and still have a blast and some sort of unique experience, even though it could seem weaker than bigger races with large weapons. Caster classes are also very pleasant to play, some of spells are way less OP than they were in IwD2 (like Mordenkainen sword, etc.), but for example here divine casters (druids/clerics) are way more pleasant, because they have more spells overall, and especially higher level spells. Also, the entire character progression is way more thought-through than in IwD2, here is way more feats, the entire epic-character system, more classes (even though not so many races), and so on. NwN2 may seem more diverse in this matter, but I couldn't make myself replay it even once, because after the game gives me a couple of companions right away, I just want to vomit. While in NwN1 I replayed dozens of times and right now I still can think of how I will replay it in future.",1701600015,1701600291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NWN has three main campaigns and a handful of premium modules - some of which can be played with friends! All together, the singleplayer adventures can offer hundreds of hours of gameplay and if that's not enough for you, NWN has a large selection of community made adventures that can be easily added to your game, and from my experience, some community modules are of higher quality than the official campaigns.

Personally, I have a hard time staying invested in the singleplayer side of NWN. Where the game truly shines is in its persistent worlds - its multiplayer servers. As a big fan of tabletop D&D I was heavily drawn into the roleplaying servers of NWN and over the past three years this game has given me my greatest gaming experiences.

The game is dated, clearly visually but if the mechanics of the ""real time"" or ""pause before taking action"" game mechanics are appealing then this game will be enjoyed.
For those who think this is an ancient game, with many patches, and now a HD texture pack, this game's days are far from over.
However if you have bought Baldurs Gate 3, or played anything D&D wise, wince the Sierra titles, Eye of the Beholder, or the first Baldurs Gate games, this is not one to be missed.  While NWN2 is the sequel and much more slick, the original NWN has got more reliable engines for the multiplayer experience.

For those who only played the boxed editions, the Enhanced edition has improved the renderers, resolved many bugs as well as made the download of ""multiplayer"" server custom content seamless without manually requiring any additional overrides or haks.

For cosmetic lovers, the modifications to get that perfectly realistic weapon model you want also exists in the workshop.

Not all multiplayer worlds are considered equal, but there are worlds that fit every players needs.  Be they a ""run and gun PvP oriented and barely any roleplaying"", to worlds which are almost 20 years old now - with plot stretching back that far.

For those who haven't really seen what ""persistent world"" DM controlled environments are like, they are not the random or predictable spawns of a single player game, they are rich where the words and alliances of characters can swing the game world much like a long term pen and paper D&D Campaign.

Avoid the Main Campaign (Even tho i think it isnt that bad and worth playing atleast 1 Time)
Best start a new Char with the Module Cult of the Reptile God (my personal fav) and lead him from there on to further Adventures.

[h1]Is it Worth in 2022?[/h1]
Truth is that there is nothing else like it even 20 f* years after the release of this game. And I will tell you why: Because NWN is not a game, it’s a set tools for D&D Campaigns in a way that makes it unique and still valuable today. It still receives modules even today! So if you’re entering this realm now you should know that you SHOULD KNOW what to play and where to get the content that is worth it.

[h1]The Main Campaign is kind of bad[/h1]
The Wailing Death is a showcase of what NWN could do at the time, as if showing content creators what they could do with the tool and how things should work - I know it’s not an excuse to how bad designed it is, but I say this to highlight what it is. The focus is not the main content but the expansions.

If you’re a newcomer like me maybe you should play the prologue/tutorial to get a hang of the basics for noobs, but you should drop it as soon as you realize how bad it is - specially if you’re feeling that it’s preventing you to know the real stuff. Or maybe you shouldn’t even bother. 

You are being warned! xD

[h1]What about this showcase stuff and toolset thing?[/h1]

NWN is cRPG on it’s infancy regarding 3D modelling, however, besides this, is also a new era of the cRPG on software design, so the game was pretty ambitious for the time as it wanted to be something else than just a Baldurs Gate in 3D. NWN was made to be a set of tools for custom made campaigns and online gaming. So the game has a lot to offer and that can be overwhelming. So let’s go by topics:

[h1]Official Modules[/h1]

Divided into classic campaigns and extra contents - all included in the enhanced edition, all developed by Bioware.

1. Classic Campaigns: I suggest start NWN by playing the Shadows of Udrentide expansion. It’s ok and a good start on NWN. Hordes of the Underdark is a direct continuation of the story. Mini review on official campaigns are in the comments. Ignore The Wailing Death - as I said above!
2. Extras: I don’t have too much to tell now since I didn’t played it and focused my research on other contents. I’ll update the review once there is something to tell. Even so, I suggest to have a look at the Premium and Community Modules first.   

[h1]Premium Modules[/h1]
These are sold separately and it’s aimed to veterans since you start characters at high levels. These modules are developed by different studios, mostly Bioware and Ossian creations. I did a research on these ones and I will write a proper review on each steam page as I play, but I can say that you should take a look at ‘Darkness over Daggerford’ and ‘Tyrants of the Moonsea’ at least. People say that these modules are the truth successors of what it was done previously on Baldurs Gate. 

[h1]Community made campaigns[/h1] 
You have tons of modules at your disposal on the Community Modules side. Do your research because there is tons of good contents mixed together with dispensable stuff. There is a NWN vault, a website that rates contents and there is always Google to send you to Reddit discussions. Do not misjudge community created campaigns as inferior. Actually, there are some hidden gems and the hardcore players tend to praise some of these, such as:

1. Aielund Saga: I’ve played a bit. It’s promising but I need to go back to have a proper opinion.
2. Sword Flight: It’s divided into 5 chapters and each one is kind of a game by itself. The first one was released on 2008, the last one on 2018 and there is a new chapter coming on 2022. Yeah, like this! It’s for veterans as it requires deep knowledge of the systems. It’s focused on combat but it has tons of opportunity to roleplay and explore. This one is highly praised by the community. Do not leave NWN without giving it a try!
3. The Prophet: I don’t know, people talk about it and I thought that listing 3 is better than 2. Once I have more info I’ll update the review.

[h1]The numbers of characters in the party varies from module to module, so as the possibility of playing in coop or not[/h1]

You can have a party, but you will control only your character, giving small instructions to your companions such as ‘guard me’, ‘heal me’, ‘attack nearest’, etc. You actually can do more stuff such as tactics, equipment management, etc. You can also posses familiars and other things. It’s pretty deep. But you don’t have a party control like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Pillars and DA Origins - NWN 2 also. This is where NWN fails for me the most, but also gives it a different approach and since we have tons of party based RPG’s out there, I’m fine. That’s why, at least for me, NWN is not Baldurs Gate successor, it’s another thing.

Also, the quantity of henchmens you can have in your party will vary depending on which module you’re playing. The Wailing Death allows only 1 companion, giving you the option to extend your party only through abilities such as animal empathy, familiars and summons. Other modules allows you to play with more companions. You should check info before diving into a new module. Each module is like a different game, with different rules, setting, etc.

You can play the adventures in coop or not. Again, varies depending on modules rules. There are single player only focused, others allow coop for up to 4 players. Playing some modules in coop can be a lot of fun since the henchmens will be real people, but I didn’t tried yet. It’s not the best scenario for lore and role playing enthusiasts like me, but on more combat focused modules it should be real fun.

[h1]Some other things to say:[/h1]

1. You can create multiple characters, one to each campaign: You will be creating characters to play new stories. That is something I’d love to see on newer entries on the cRPG and RPG genre. 
2. AI is not so good: Be prepared to deal with a weird AI. But it works in the end.
4. NWN is based on D&D third edition and it’s aimed to be a computer version of the system. I think Bioware nailed on this one.
5. The game is showing it’s age, but is unique and has a lot to offer: Don’t judje the game by it’s visuals. NWN has a lot to offer even today.
6. Play on easy if you’re not familiar with NWN and D&D, maybe even if you do on your first run so you can get a hand of how things works before dialing up the difficulty. 

[h1]Online gaming[/h1] 

I can’t say too much about it since I didn’t tried it. But NWN has 2 other things that is so important to the game that I think it should be on this review.

1. You can play a custom adventure with a human DM. This is awesome and maybe it’s the more close to the real tabletop RPG a videogame can get.
2. You can play on servers like a MMO style. Didn’t tried it but looks like playing an actual MMO is better today. 

[h1]Conclusion: Why there is nothing like it until today?[/h1]

It’s worth it because there is nothing quite like it until today on the community modules thing. NWN is like opening a D&D book where you can play not only the premade stories, but also the infinite stories that can come out of it. 

Games like Divinity OS2 and NWN2 offers similar structure for community campaigns, however, people say that DO2 is too much effort to do anything there, so there is few options actually, like 10 campaigns if you’re lucky? As for NWN 2 side, it actually offers some decent options, but not as much as NWN1. I think it’s not appealing as NWN1 due to too much effort and a bit buggy things. Again, never tried to put a module myself, all I’m saying is thanks to research.

[code]PS: Since I’m still playing and exploring NWN, this is a review that I can come back and change things- and then give it a proper rate. I’ll reserve some comments spaces to talk about community modules I play down below!

I tried playing the OG campaign, even though I've heard it wasn't good. I actually enjoyed the plot and everything else, but the clunky UI, terrible companion Ai and graphics that are worse than even some old PS2 games simply ruined the experience for me.
I could live with graphics, I enjoy the atmosphere, I could get used to the clunky UI, but the reason I don't recommend is the worst companion AI I have ever seen in the videogames so far. The companions habitually stop following you, getting stuck in the place. They randomly attack doors instead of enemies, then when you're in trouble, they stand there and stare at you. Apparently, issuing an order, ANY order, breaks the companions to the point where they won't do anything else anymore, no matter what kind of fix you make. 
I tried playing some custom campaigns, like Aielund Saga and Prophet. This review is about the game only, and I won't get deeper into reviewing any campaigns, but it's enough to tell the OG campaign was much more enjoyable than any custom campaign, and that speak volumes.
While this game is still good for multiplayer content and the sheer creativity players can employ in creating their own stories, aside of that it brings little value to the table other than pure nostalgia value that will keep the players coming back, only to delete it twenty hours later due to game-breaking bugs, clunkiness and generally ugly 3D graphics.",1699099678,1699099678,False,1,0,0.480594277381896973,0,True,False,False

Fans of D&D will enjoy this. The game is based on a simplified system of 3.5e, and feels authentic to the experience. The first campaign is a bit of a drag to get through - I didn't complete it until I was 20 - but the expansions are excellent, and it's clear BioWare learns from their mistakes and makes changes accordingly. Unlike the Platinum edition CD I had when I was a kid, this version of the game comes with all sorts of extra adventures, and I think (I hope!) it also comes with the option to create your own games and run other players through them. As soon as I buy this game for all my friends, I'm going to try it out and see how well it works.
As much fun and as much as I love this game, it has its issues. The main campaign and two main expansions, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark, are nearly impossible - in my experience - to complete without playing a fighter type or a rogue. Especially SoU! The only two possible companions (at least at first) in SoU are a thief/cleric and a sorcerer, and to play most effectively you really need to be a fighter type or a rogue type with the other as your companion. Playing as anything else makes the game much more difficult. I've come across some changes in this version than in the game I played on the disc as a kid - just two UI changes that bother me a bit. You used to be able to push the camera around your character by pressing the mouse against the side of the screen. Maybe I'm the foolish one, but none of the settings I've changed have allowed that. And the pointer is a bit off. Rather than the index finger of the mouse pointing exactly to where you're clicking, it's slightly in the palm around the thumb, and it makes aiming clicks more frustrating. It does help that most functions in the game can be done multiple ways - pressing ESC to close windows instead of trying to snipe the X, using keybinds instead of carefully mousing over the little menu under your character - but it seems sloppy and could stand to be fixed.
Don't let my complaining deter you! Just be aware there are little foibles that might be irritating to deal with in an otherwise absorbing and exciting game. I've been playing this off-and-on for most of my life, and it's shaped me as a storyteller as well as inspiring me as a Dungeon Master.

It's hard to believe that Neverwinter Nights was done by the same company. Even though it should be a better game since it’s “newer”, there are so many things that have gone wrong. First, it has a different engine. This shouldn’t be a con per se, but everything seems to be made in a lazy manner: the exteriors look “minecrafty”, the interiors are empty with one or two chests waiting to be bashed or lock-picked. Now, I understand the engine is part of the tool to let players create their own worlds, but the way BioWare rendered their original campaign is pure, shoddy work. A commonplace you see in the original campaign: you are outside, you see a small shack with a flat roof, it looks like a shed. You enter and inside is a large house with several rooms with basically nothing inside, maybe a library case, a stairwell in disrepair you cannot climb up and a chest to be looted! Yeah!
Only if the story-telling was of the same quality as the previous games, but no, it’s as if they hired someone from elementary school to do the texts. There are no complex stories like in Baldur’s Gate, where you had an elaborate business case being forced upon western Faerun, clashing with a Bhaalspawn’s plans… or the goosebumps everytime you delve into what makes up the story of Planescape: Torment. Nothing to see here in Neverwinter. Just silly writing.
There is also very little choice of where to go next. You always start a chapter at a place from where you can decide to go either north, south, west or east, at the end of which you always get an item you need to progress to the next chapter (yes, you usually need to fetch four items, but sometimes one cardinal direction is left out, so the duration of you pain is shorter by one item).
The graphics are appalling, but I don't want to get into that… it's a 20-year old game, so no bashing here.
The UI is terrible as well... you have to click through several panels to cast a spell. Yes, you can quickslot them, but still… too much useless clutter.
The only time I started enjoying the game was the third campaign: Hordes of the Underdark. A lot of I criticise in Wailing Death and Shadows of Undrentide is addressed in some way. The drow city was made very well and I felt like in Ust Natha again… Sadly, Hordes of the Underdark makes up only a small, final portion of the game.

The Good & the Bad:
+ music and sounds are engaging and add to the atmosphere
+ the 3rd edition rules are better than the 2nd (highly subjective)
+ your choices finally move your alignment on each axis (lawful vs chaotic, good vs evil)

-	poor writing, silly dialogues
-	the graphics haven’t aged well
-	terrible UI
-	you don’t have a party of adventurers, just one “henchman”, which decreases the complexity of combat and interactions

This game is a classic and is stuck between Baldur's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic/Jade Empire in Bioware's timeline.
It doesn't have the hand-drawn charm of the first and still has that very early 3D aspect unlike the latter ones which looked a bit more beautiful/detailed and with less repetitive environments.

[b]This review is regarding the Single Player campaign aspect (Default, Shadows of Undrentide & Hordes of the Underdark).[/b]
It's really dated, with its old 3rd Edition rules, its somewhat bland story which is a collection of various side quests (and glorified fetch quests), its tedious dungeon delving and its sometimes bland/limited choices of henchmen that you can take with you.

It's a Bioware game from the early days and because the story and characters were much better in Baldur's Gate, the biggest danger is to play this thinking it's its spiritual sequel like I did 20 years ago which made me absolutely hate it.
I remember I forced myself to play through it and thinking how strange the rules were, how boring and repetitive it was.

I played the enhanced version and while I went in with rose tinted glasses, I still thought (especially near the end) how it was a slog. It's also much easier than Baldur's Gate and more like Knights of the Old Republic where the challenge is much lower. Bear in mind that instead of a party of 6, this time you can only have 1 henchman in the first two campaigns and 2 in the second add-on.
This limits a lot the ""party interactions"" and will make you focus on your role and the main NPCs of the story.

The story is okayish, classic fantasy, maybe the last bit becomes a bit too crazy (but it's normal because you are supposed to be Epic level 20+). Some side quests are nice, a lot are fetch quests or simply discovering various parts of the maps and encountering the enemy or the item needed back.
It's a bit better in the two add-ons but it's more like a classic Dungeons & Dragons module rather than an epic movie style adventure. 
I have to admit that the whole point of this game was that it was supposed to be a DM online tool so that people could get together and play modules/adventures created by other players. The main Single Player campaign was just supposed to be an example so it can't be judged too much.

The music is great but after 30 hours, it becomes very repetitive and annoying, the voice acting is done only for a few lines for some important NPCs, don't expect Mass Effect (yet).

The graphics of the game is the less appreciable part of the game. I'll admit that the environment are very repetitive, most NPCs look the same and the items are almost impossible to discern unless you get really used to it after 20 hours but again, compared to Baldur's Gate, it looks like a step back.

Regarding the enhancement, unlike the Baldur's Gate one (I keep mentioning it), the list is less impressive but you still get to play a bug free and plug 'n play version of this game. I had no crashes and just encountered some light bugs (basically strange loot items in some very specific and rare enemies' corpses).

Even if I keep sounding negative, why do I still recommend it? Only for historical reason. It's a classic D&D game, if you want a by-the-number, old 3rd edition simulator of D&D then it's perfect for you. 
If you are looking for a prequel of Jade Empire/Dragon Age/Knights of the Old Republic, then move along, you will find it very hard to enjoy and finish this game.

I personally prefer Neverwinter Nights 2 for advancing the formula, but the original does feel more consistent in its tone and writing. NWN2 is good but can be a bit awkward to get into - while this one feels much more like a classic RPG.

NWN is a great Dungeons and Dragons themed RPG with an excellent story and meaningful choices you can make as you progress the story and individual events. This makes it fun to play, fun to customize your character, and fun to see what will happen next in the story. At one point for example you can oversee a trial held by otherworldly beings for the souls of those who allowed a massacre to occur. You gather evidence and statements, including from a powerful demon if you figure out how to summon it properly without it killing you, and then can use this evidence and make a decision. 

Of course there also is plenty of combat and the like as well, and the D&D 3.0/3.5 edition rules don't translate the best to video game form, but it still is every enjoyable once you know what you are doing.",1692172908,1692172908,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beamdog has absolutely crushed it.  

And I absolutely would LOVE to see a NWN3, or just a totally updated NWN, with a full release (at full price) built on a new graphics engine.  Most of the scripting and internal code could be preserved.  

I mean, can you imagine the NWN toolset, module base, and PW experience we have now, largely unchanged (except where improved), except built in the new Unreal Engine???  

It would dominate fantasy RPGs for at least a decade.  BG3 is an awesome game, but it doesn't have the toolset to provide it the longevity.  Longevity is actually the last thing most companies want - they want a hit that leaves people hungry to throw money at a sequel.

Beamdog could make their money from not just the game itself, but DLC.  There are no shortage of content creators that would be happy to work with them and sell and update their modules for a small cut - in most cases it wouldn't be about the money - as long as they get a small nut and see their work in a professional game there are lots of creators that would flock to that and make some excellent modules, worlds, and resources.",1691478004,1691478080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is more than just a game, it is a framework upon which enthusiasts can create endless amounts of 3.5 edition rules D&D adventures. Despite the age of the game, it is supported to this day by the current developer, who just recently put out an update that included tons of bug fixes as well as many quality of life improvements. There is an incredibly robust mod community, and the graphics mods alone push this way beyond what you would expect for a game of this age. There are several servers which are still current, with tons of active users who will welcome you if you want to start a multiplayer experience with like-minded folks. If you want to play D&D on your computer, you have hit the mother lode.

But what about the actual *game* i.e. the campaign that comes with the game, you say? Well, it's fine. Perfectly serviceable, but nothing to set it apart from most other CRPGs. I was enjoying myself just fine EXCEPT....
The end of the game had a ridiculous difficulty spike that prevented me from finishing. Like, order of magnitude increase. I went from having to spam potions to keep myself and my allies alive to getting team wiped over and over just to kill a couple of mobs - and this was *after* dropping to the easiest difficulty. Finally, with two more boss fights to go, I had spent virtually all of my enormous stockpile of gold on potions and scrolls and I couldn't survive long enough to barely scratch my enemies. Add to that, my character kept getting the ""frightened"" status applied, which makes you completely helpless, *despite the fact that your character isn't supposed to get frightened at the easiest difficulty*. Like, at all. I had no option but to quit the game. Needless to say, this infuriated me and almost ruined the entire experience.

So there you have it, folks. Great *game*, but a lousy *game*, if you get what I'm saying. Your Mileage May Vary.",1691259356,1691259512,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The game is great and uses 3E D&D rules, and the world is Faerun, very detailed and linked to some famous books.
I love the soundtrack, the gameplay (especially that of arcane classes) and the story. HotU is the best of all the dlcs, very funny and high-power campaing.
I totally recommend it even to those who would like to play PnP D&D or Pathfinder, it's a great introduction to those games.
Sadly the EE doesn't offer very much aside from the better resolution.
There are some old bugs, stuttering and lag. Some new ones too (like a strange ""PC property"" item in a lot of mobs remains).

Overall a solid 8/10, can't wait to have NWN 2 too on Steam.

There isn't any issues with the update to the Enhanced Edition that I noticed and my only experience is with the base content and the Shadows of Undrentide content. I haven't touched any of the fan content that I've heard is really good such as the Aielund Saga.

I wanted to play through the original content as i usually like to do that before doing any fan stuff, but that probably ended up being a mistake.  In the 23 hours or so I've played, I did the first chapter of the original campaign and a lot of the first chapter of Shadows of undrentide.  The problem is that the core of the game is the same and I didn't really care for that (the story not being anything special to keep me going didn't help).

For starters, I don't really like how it's just you (and possibly a henchman).  I guess the idea is that this was meant for the fan made content with multiplayer?  Any additional help (henchman, animal companion, or summon) reduces XP gains by like 20% so if you take just a henchman (or animal companion or summon), you might end up 1 level behind a solo character and it gets worse as your group gets bigger.  I somewhat get it - the game does get easier with more characters so it's a balance thing, but boy does it also make things tedious. That means you just have one character to hold loot and with weight limits.. that can get rough even with bags of holding.  Sure you can teleport (at least easily in the base content with the stone of recall), but it got tedious after awhile. A full party to spread the junk around would've been nice. Even then, I started to wonder what exactly was I looting for?  As a Druid, I didn't really find anything I needed to buy anyway - I did all henchman quests and got their items which was better than what I found/could buy so I ended up with over 20,000 gold even when I just got only magical items... 

Of course, to get the loot, you had to deal with locks and traps.  You basically need someone (you or a henchman) to open the locks. Sure, you can bash the locks (such as I had to do as a Druid), but that took far longer than it was ever worth (oh you just spent 30 seconds - 1 minute to open a chest for... 5 gold pieces at most).  As far as I could tell, only Tomi (base game) could pick locks which leads to a second complaint.

None of the henchman (at least in the base game) were that good - except maybe Grimgnaw (the evil monk).  I tried them all with a focus on Daelen (the half orc fighter or whatever) and Grimngnaw) since I was a Druid and wanted a tank (could've and probably should've used the animal companion instead, but didn't want to lose more xp).  Most Companions just seemed very weak and... exceptionally stupid.  Like, wasting spells on the wrong foes stupid.  Of the bunch, Grimgnaw had good stats and was powerful, but even he had issues with the AI every so often - sometimes just ignoring enemies that were right there...  Also, as far as I can tell, you can only tell followers to follow or attack nearest.  There was no way to actually control them which would've been really nice for the times i open up a room full of enemies and my caster had to aggro them to get my stupid henchman to attack instead of sending the henchman in the room first.

Combat was just felt slow and tedious - though this might be because I played a Druid and really couldn't do anything beyond weak slings and Grease (which seemed really powerful) until I got Call of Lightning or whatever, but then you just get a few casts so you would have to rest to use it again.  There was no cost to resting (though finding a spot away from enemies to do so would get annoying) and was often faster to do that than try to fight where I did little damage in melee (unless shapeshifted) or little damage with a sling (which quickly became useless).

I honestly just ended up using console command to give myself 18 in all stats. which honestly helped somewhat as I got good carrying capacity and could do already in melee... but that doesn't help that the story wasn't overly appealing.

The camera also was bad and it felt like I was fighting that for good view as much as I was fighting enemies.  The sound wasn't good either - there's background noises to make the areas feel alive, but the noises just quickly got old for me.

I played and beat the original campaign when it came out.  I remember thinking was okay (better than Icewind Dale, but worse that Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment), but decided to try again.  Again, I can't recommend it if you want to play the official content - though I've heard the fan stuff can be good and maybe it'ls alright if that's what you want?",1688075951,1688075951,False,4,0,0.484037488698959351,0,True,False,False

The economy is made entirely by players crafting and trading with loot they find in dungeons. Everyone on the server is in character the whole time.

update June 5 '23:
Well, that didn't last long.  Something messed up the toolset editor when creating new armor, opening the color pallet messes up the selected appearance and the SOU official campaign has a game breaking bug at the first fight with the Drogan vs the kobolds, there is an invisible NPC in the center of the room that will not die, only shows up in the combat log.  I noticed this happen after the 87.X patch released.
On a side note, I don't use custom haks, never installed one.

It's a classic DnD RPG in the vein of Baldurs Gate and from the same studio. The main campaign is fine enough hack & slash affair with story that's just about enough to keep you hacking and slashing through it, but little more than that. Then why does everyone still keep playing this game? Why do I? Well, either for the custom content modules and their standalone stories or the online multiplayer.

I'm firmly in the single player module side of things and can confidently say that NWN has some of the best mods for any game ever made. Infamous modules like Dance With Rogues, Swordflight Series, Aielund Saga, Prophet, Sapphire Star, Beyond the Gate Ravenloft and many, many more are bound to keep you playing and entertained for hundreds of hours. It certainly doesn't hurt that some of these modules are better stories/content than most RPGs released today as full priced games. Good bang for the buck, I'd say.

The only major issues I see with the game are that it looks old, plays somewhat janky and is hard to get into as a new player. You really need to know your 3rd edition rules to enjoy this game properly and the game doesn't exactly guide you through most of it. If old looking games don't scare you and you're interested in trying out some of the community made content for it, I'd heartily recommend this game to just about anyone wanting to scratch that classic RPG itch.",1686609913,1686609913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Neverwinter Nights was released after Baldur's Gate series and it should be its spiritual successor. However, what made BG a good game is completely lacking in this game: character progression.

There is no party to speak of. Only generic AI controlled henchmen that could have been replaced by a broom and it would have had a more compelling backstory. First chapter, go to North, East, South and West parts in a city and acquire some artifact. Second chapter, go to North, East, South and West and acquire an object, but that time in a forest. After that I could no longer play this game.

Now, the combat and rules adaptations is great. So maybe there is a saving grace if you play multiplayer. But as a stand-alone cRPG, it is horrible.

I remember spending most my time playing fan made adventures which were immensely better than the actual game. Maybe as a platform, this game is recommended.But as a game, no.

Also, the graphics have no charm. The game suffered from a time you had enough power to render 3D models but not enough to make them good. It ended up falling into the uncanny valley.",1686498267,1686498267,False,2,0,0.482319056987762451,0,True,False,False

Hordes of the Underdark (One of the official expansions) is a wild trip to different planes to say the least! Neverwinter Nights is the best RPG I've ever played and go back to; only recently played it with friends, which made it even better! Rarely do I get invested in and think about character stories for time 'after' playing a game, but if you give it a chance and read what's going on in the world, you'll definitely get that payoff.

Some 20 years later I've enjoyed stumbling into playing it.

With CRPGS I prefer being able to learn a game's mechanics and engine as you progress through multiple unique campaigns. NWN:EE does this well by providing 3 studio made campaigns - a handful of shorter content and a community of player made campaigns and modules due to the studio releasing the tools to create your own.

The obvious shortfall here is that you are dealing with some dated graphics. I tried Solasta - thinking it's kind of a ""refreshed"" formula of being a recent CRPG with an open tool-set - but it hasn't quite clicked with me yet. I'm not sure if that's just because I prefer the 3rd edition D&D rule-set over 5th, or if it just needs 20 more years of the community pushing it to make it better.

NWN:EE is just going to be something I leave on the hard-drive and keep jumping into for a while. The IOS application also performs well - and I am guilty of owning and keeping that handy as well.

This game is a treasure for every Nerd out there along with Baulder's Gate or anything from late 90's to early 00's RPGs. These were the days of even if the popular kids rolled their eyes at you and the joint smoking rocker kids wrote you off as a poser, you were basically authentic in the eyes of chess club, book clubs and most after school programs including those who's weekend fun was stargazing, watching cartoons of your favorite comics or buying collectibles of your favorite anime was a thing. Nowadays, Neverwinter Nights is amongst the few existing classics there are any longer as the RPG scene is dominated by Bethesda, BioWare (though Bioware partly helped make this game), CD Projekt Red and Blizzard and in the east Square-Enix, outside of that there are only startups and indie studios who make RPGs the way they used to be made. Neverwinter Nights is campaign based and each campaign was the length of a single long Elder Scrolls main zone quest in an open world of a lot of narratives waiting to be explored, you usually can only explore one with this one but the side quests are simply a quick trot into zones swimming in foes where they act by dice rules hence why the combat is calculated and slow. I'm pretty sure someone if they tried could complete the game in less than a day along with the other campaigns, short as it may be it is still a nostalgic trip before games started focusing on a depressing reality like The Last of Us. The music is the early days or maybe of Jeremy Soule when fantasy RPG music was still in peak performance and likely he had to train others to make epic fantasy music for RPGs or even epic Sci-Fi music for RPG shooters (though that requires training in electronic music). Jeremy Soule I imagine was making music before Howard Shore made the soundtrack to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's a bit too bad that his last work was on Skyrim before some socio-political quagmire railroaded his career as it did with a lot of brilliant creators. Even for as simple as this game is it holds a special place in my Geriatric Millennial heart, it was one of the first RPGs besides Dungeon Siege I played and no I never started with tabletop, in fact my first tabletop experience was a game my bro-in-law made. I will not declare I feel old until 50 but when I do this game will merit an honorary place in my library as I'm sure it will with a lot of old school role players. It is owned by Wizards of the Coast and Atari and now Beamdog who preserved it even if we'll likely remember it as one of BioWare's first games before fame came knocking and they got too big to like and EA bought out and ruined them. Take heart this isn't wholly considered a BioWare game, it is at its heart a classic and a WotC game at that.",1682137757,1682830196,True,1,0,0.48540884256362915,1,True,False,False

The game falters a little bit if you're playing it by yourself, since the henchmen that you can hire as other party members are severely lacking. You can't directly control them, most of the official content only allows you to hire one (meaning you're probably choosing a rogue, unless you want to play one), and if there's a way to get the rogue henchmen to use thieves' tools, I've never figured it out. I would also recommend against playing the main campaign first, and playing Shadows of Undrentide as your first campaign, instead. It has pretty much the same level range as the original campaign, but it's significantly more fun and creative. It's not a bad idea to run through the prelude of the original campaign (also known as The Wailing Death), since you can level your character up to 3 and get some decent gear for them in less than an hour, then save that character and transfer them over to Shadows of Undrentide. It's not required, though as Chapter 1 of Undrentide is pretty well balanced.

Highly recommended if you intend to play this game with other people (even 1 other player is enough to drastically improve this game, imo), while a somewhat more tepid recommendation if you intend to play this game by yourself. If you're looking for a single-player DnD game, this one can scratch that itch, you just need to know what you're getting into regarding the henchman system, and DnD 3.0's many anachronistic design choices (e.g. Cantrips are not only much weaker than in 5e, but can only be cast a limited number of times per rest, and skill points are pretty tight since there's a lot of skills that you really want, like Tumble and Discipline to avoid special combat maneuvers that can ruin you if you're not careful, on top of whatever skills you need for your characters to feel like they're performing their jobs adequately).",1682250512,1682250512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the best part? You don't need any social skills, just a lot of Mountain Dew and Cheetos.

With violence so realistic, you'll swear ye can smell the blood and guts spilling from your enemies. Or maybe that's just the smell of your mom's cooking, who knows?

But what really sets Neverwinter Nights apart is the endless supply of Dungeons & Dragons campaigns you can make yourself. You can finally live out all those wild fantasies you had as a kid, like fighting dragons, or seducing the town mayor with your charming charisma.

And don't forget the nostalgia factor. Playing Neverwinter Nights is like being transported back to a simpler time, when all you had to worry about was whether or not you had enough dice to roll for damage.

So why bother with real-world success when you can be a hero in your own mind? Give Neverwinter Nights a try, and you'll be hooked faster than a halfling thief in a jewelry store.

Released by BioWare back in 2002, this classic RPG is a shining example of immersive storytelling, engaging gameplay, and a vibrant community that has continued to expand and enhance the game even after two decades.

One of the key factors that set Neverwinter Nights apart from other RPGs is its phenomenal expansion campaigns, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark. Both of these add-ons provide hours upon hours of additional gameplay, with new quests, characters, and locations that enrich the already fascinating world of Neverwinter. The expansions further extend the game's depth by introducing innovative gameplay mechanics, like prestige classes and epic-level content, allowing players to further develop their characters and face even greater challenges.

The community content for Neverwinter Nights is another aspect that keeps the game fresh and exciting. The Aurora Toolset, which comes with the game, allows players to create their own custom adventures and share them with others. This has led to an impressive array of fan-made modules, ranging from simple one-shot adventures to entire campaigns with complex narratives and world-building rivaling that of official content. The dedication and creativity of the Neverwinter Nights community have truly breathed life into the game, giving it a longevity that few other titles can boast.

Not only has the community provided countless hours of additional content, but they have also developed mods and patches that have enhanced and updated the game, keeping it compatible with modern systems and adding quality-of-life improvements. With a thriving online community, players can join multiplayer servers to explore fan-made worlds or team up with friends to tackle adventures together, creating a truly unique and shared experience.

In conclusion, Neverwinter Nights is a classic that remains relevant and engaging even after so many years. The rich expansion campaigns and the vast array of community content make this game a must-play for any RPG enthusiast. If you're looking for an immersive, story-driven adventure with an active and dedicated community, look no further than Neverwinter Nights.",1680646174,1680646174,True,5,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition is an absolute must-play for any RPG fan. This game was already a classic when it first came out, and now with the Enhanced Edition, it's even better than ever. The improvements to graphics and gameplay mechanics are noticeable, and the addition of new content and features only adds to the already impressive experience.

One of the things that sets Neverwinter Nights apart from other RPGs is the amount of control you have over your character. The level of customization available for character creation is unmatched, and the class system is deep and satisfying. There's something here for every type of RPG player, whether you prefer spellcasting, sword fighting, or sneaky tactics.

The story is also fantastic, taking you on a journey through the Forgotten Realms that will keep you hooked from start to finish. The game world is rich and immersive, with plenty of lore to uncover and secrets to discover. The voice acting is top-notch, and the music is memorable and atmospheric.

One of the great things about Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition is the fact that it includes all of the original game's expansions, as well as some new content. The enhanced graphics and updated user interface make the game more accessible than ever before, while still retaining the classic RPG feel.

Overall, I would highly recommend Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition to any RPG fan. It's a timeless classic that has only gotten better with age, and the Enhanced Edition brings it to a whole new level.

Toolset's still Windows only, but thankfully both Linux and Windows versions of the game can coexist in the same install directory, as the two versions are in separate folders and use the same assets, meaning with Protontricks you can use the toolset while actively using the Linux binary for actually playing the game.

The only sore spot left for us Linux users is that there's a NASTY memory leak, one that persists until rebooting your PC or running a command to clean out unused inodes.  Thankfully it isn't terribly fast, and by the time the memory leak reaches a breaking point at least a few hours have gone by.  Highly recommend not using any advanced graphical options on Linux outside of maybe for screenshots though; my admittedly limited testing suggests that advanced shaders drastically increase the memleak problem in the current build.

If you look in the Steam forum page entitled ""Linux memory leak"", you'll see that I've posted a shell script that at least allows you to continue using your PC after closing the game, without running out of RAM.  Feel free to use it to solve the memleak problem, until the game gets its last patch soon (tm) that will fix as many of them as they can without breaking scripting.

Regardless it's not a big deal for Windows users, as I haven't heard of Windows users suffering from the unused inodes memory leak problem.  It's exclusively a Linux problem, even with Proton; something about the way the Linux kernel is structured seems to REALLY dislike however they programmed NWN:EE, regardless of whether it's run natively or through Proton.  Haven't tested the admittedly stupid crazy idea of emulating the Android or Switch versions, but it'd be weird if they also had the bug when run on Linux, as that would indicate that something about the way the game is coded is inherently imcompatible with the Linux kernel, though not enough to stop it from functioning flawlessly outside of creeping RAM usage.

Also, FYI the PRC pack has fully switched to EE exclusively, meaning if you want new features in that modpack, you WILL need to switch from Diamond to EE.  Same goes for a lot of other new content packs, as they are aimed squarely at EE's enhanced graphical and scripting features.  There isn't much reason to keep on using Diamond Edition now, outside of the extremely rare edge case of something relying on the old binaries, like NWNCX.  Old reviews kept for archival.

EDIT: Turns out some of my complaints are a bit outdated.  Apparently fairly recently they've vastly improved stability, made the Premium Modules semi-unencrypted (still a total PITA to mod, but no longer completely impossible like what it once was) and patched (apparently Infinite Dungeons EE now actually works in multiplayer, or at least the PRC version does, as a dedicated server exists for ID PRC Edition), and have added some new QoL features that mod authors can use that aren't available in Diamond Edition.  Some of the complaints are still valid, e.g. no working Linux toolset, Workshop being absurdly badly designed to the point that you're better off getting content from Neverwinter Vault instead, focus being put on console and mobile versions instead of the only good version aka PC, etc., but I now can safely say that the game isn't quite the dumpster fire it was before.

It may still be thumbs down, but treat it more like a ""thumbs sideways"".  Still needs more work to actually be a 1:1 replacement for the old version (Linux toolkits, nwncx community patch functions fully implemented into the base game so that the PRC could actually have non-dialog based custom spellbooks for nonstandard classes, much better workshop implementation, better compatibility for extreme edge cases regarding scripting, etc.), but it's actually playable now.  Frankly I'd argue you're better off getting it on GOG though because then you also get NWN Diamond, meaning you have full compatibility with both NWN:EE modules and multiplayer, AND have access to nwncx-related stuff and a toolkit that works without bugs on Linux through wine.

Original review below, for archival purposes.

NWN is a classic game with an amazing community and is arguably the only D&D video game that actually can potentially mimic the tabletop game near perfectly thanks to multiplayer, a DM client, and one of the easiest to use toolkits in all of video gaming.

Sadly Beamdog can't program to save their life, and they somehow took version 1.69 and absolutely ruined it.  Here are their biggest failures:
1. Game is insanely unstable; I wondered if the original Diamond Edition was as unstable, so I installed that.  Turns out NWN:Diamond actually is much more stable.  Thanks to mods, too, most of the benefits of NWN:EE are backportable to NWN Diamond.
2. This may have been fixed by now, but a longstanding issue is that Infinite Dungeons, the only premium module really worth bothering with, only functions in singleplayer.  Trying to load it in multiplayer causes the poor saps trying to connect to your game to wind up with either an infinite loading screen or just a black screen.  Given how Beamdog took YEARS to finally release the 64 bit binary, which is still quite unstable AFAIK, the likelihood that this is fixed is pretty much zilch.  While I've never tested it, NWN Diamond shouldn't have this problem in its version of Infinite Dungeons.
3. On the note of Premium Modules, Beamdog promised they would unencrypt the Premium Modules eventually to open up modding opportunities.  As per usual with those chuckleheads, this promise never got done, meaning Infinite Dungeons is still stuck with just the base game content.
4. The Toolkit is still unusable on Linux, in that no toolkit binary exists for the platform.  No, Proton will not help you, since the Windows version is doubly unstable on Linux (noticing a trend here?).  Incidentally running Diamond Edition through Wine works flawlessly, and in fact the toolkit works perfectly there too.
5. They wasted an enormous amount of time porting the game to consoles and phones despite the game being driven by usermade content.  Their sole priority with the game is making craptons of cash off of nostalgic idiots.  At least Bioware during the NWN era actually cared about making the community happy...shame EA devoured them and spat out the bones a few years later.
6. Workshop support is incredibly half assed.  Each Workshop entry has its own folder, and theoretically at game launch they're all supposed to be visible to the game.  Sadly this isn't the case, as I've had nothing but problems getting all of the mods to load.  Some of them load, others don't, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why this happens.  The only foolproof solution is to copy the contents of the folder into your NWN user directory, which defeats the entire purpose of Workshop content.  Also, since everything's stored in its own folders, if workshop entries have the same files, this can literally balloon your install into the kind of levels AAA games these days push i.e. 50+GB.  On my Linux install, the Workshop entries ate up so much HDD space that I had mere kilobytes of free space left.  Removing the game freed up an enormous amount of HDD space.  Incidentally Diamond Edition could have rather large filesizes too, but at least there you had exactly one copy of each file, as opposed to potentially having 3 or more separate installs of the Community Expansion Pack because of idiotic workshop implementation.

All in all I can easily recommend NWN...but not Beamdog's crap they call ""Enhanced"".  I honestly am not sure where you can even get NWN Diamond Edition these days, as Beamdog has systemically purged all storefronts of the non-""enhanced"" D&D games.  Regardless, I'd stay away from their awful crap and find some other way of playing the game.",1576430659,1679032791,True,0,0,0.78769296407699585,1,True,False,False

This is a serviceable rerelease of a beloved classic. If you’re looking at this for nostalgia reasons, you’ll probably be very satisfied.

If you’re not considering this game for nostalgia reasons, I’d probably look elsewhere though. NWN has not aged well, with a clunky and unappealing UI, terrible pacing in the single player experience, no party mechanics, and no graphical improvements to speak of (aside from more resolution options). Really, it plays more like a lazy port than it does an ‘enhanced edition’, and feels inappropriately priced as a result.

There’s a lot to like here, though. This is a D&D video game, which is a big draw all by itself. The toolkit that comes with the game allows you to design your own adventures, and there are twenty years of fan-made modules to go through - though as with anything fan-made, quality varies in the extreme. Also, if you’re into online roleplaying communities (and all the drama and social politics that come with them), NWN has many, and a few of them are still trucking along in 2023. Clearly, there’s something here that a lot of people really love.

Ultimately, I can’t see myself recommending this to anybody but the most hardcore of RPG or D&D fans. I can think of ten RPGs off the top of my head that I’d recommend before this.

One choice the original campaign did well was that the recall location had a healer and a merchant available very close to the recall point and a way to get back to where you recalled from.

Make no mistake: there's a ton of content that you can enjoy out of the box and when you add the phenomenal additional campaigns available as DLC, like Darkness Over Daggerford, there's even more. But the main attraction here is the toolset, and the years and years worth of community-made content made with that toolset. As such this is definitely a game you'll want to buy on PC rather than consoles; the console versions are valiant attempts to translate the game engine into a more gamepad-friendly format, but can only really provide access to the official content. It would be like buying a console version of RPG Maker that only contained five or six pre-made games and barred access to the actual... RPG Maker.

Graphically this game hasn't aged all too well, although to be honest I find the early-2000s-ish PC graphics charming enough on their own. As an Enhanced Edition, this version of the game has all the bells and whistles, and the devs seem to have done a good job at updating it with better UI-scaling and so on without breaking compatibility with community content. This isn't like Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition; there's no forced-feeling new content in the main campaigns, no inferior comic-book-style animatic FMV replacements, nothing of that sort. It's a no-frills re-release of the Neverwinter Nights content and toolsets.

The most you'll get in the way of ""additional"" content is that a few more premium modules have been added as DLC, although this content isn't always strictly ""new."" Apart from the main three classic campaigns, none of the adventures here are even connected to each other narratively, so if you end up not liking this one or that one, it isn't even as if that has any potential to sour your enjoyment of the others.

The one kind of irritating aspect of Neverwinter Nights, which is more an issue in the main Wailing Death adventure than in later content, is that this engine has a really annoying way of handling NPC companions in single-player. The game was designed very much with multiplayer engagement in mind; the way the game handles ""henchmen"" in single-player is rudimentary. You aren't allowed many of them (the main campaign lets you take ONE companion along at a time, though later content increases the limit to two), and your control over them isn't quite as good as it would be in a game like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. So in single-player specifically, party balance can be tricky and campaigns that make heavy use of challenges geared toward specific classes can be a bit of a headache to deal with. Community content is usually pretty good at mitigating this, but it's definitely a pain to deal with in the official content.

But still. There's nothing else out there quite like Neverwinter Nights, and it really is worth dealing with the aging graphics and the occasionally irritating limitations of the toolset to experience what it has to offer. Neverwinter Nights is a gift that keeps on giving, and I'm thrilled that this version of it exists to keep that magic alive.",1675963816,1675963816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because it is so goddamn addictive. I played about 110 hours (not counting idle runtime) in 2 weeks now.

This is a classic Dungeons and Dragons Style RPG, meaning two things:
1) Choose your character and skills carefully. Depending on who you choose to be, you pretty much have to stay true to that playstyle if you wish to really become stronger over time.
2) Everything depends on (simulated) dice rolls. You can get lucky or have the worst numbers imaginable. Depending on this factor, fights can either be easy as pie, or you get killed in seconds because that one single ability roll did not work out the way it was supposed to.

It is a brilliant RPG with different campaigns, and you can theoretically spend thousands of hours here with all the extra campaigns the community has created over the years.

This game is dungeons and dragons, as you want to play it. Every server is handmade by Dungeon Masters for over 20 years, and some have changed all the rules. Made it their own. 
Have you ever wanted to customize your character, the race, the one, two or three classes, then go into game write a description of your character, then customize down to the right or left boot or shoulder plate and then make it pure black or rainbow, or just paint old rust and the green of the forest.

It's a great game to play if your looking to get ""into character"" and write your interaction with the community as you'd do on face to face on a table. Or if you want to get on discord with your friends and just grind out and try and experiment and build druid with spellcasting wisdom based, combined with the shapeshifting to a dragon for extra strenght and defense, combined with the wisdom based monk Armour class bonus, and stunning fist ...

Pros:
- Some new graphical options (DOF, AA)
- A better optimization for modern OSs
- The standard version of the game has a lot of campaigns.
- Working coop/multiplayer (well, sort of a working multiplayer). You can join via steam, you can host and invite friends via steam. The servers listing is there as well.

Cons:
- If you buy this game to play coop with your friend, make sure you live together and connect via lan.
Otherwise whoever will be joining the server will experience terrible lags due to a high ping.
This is terribly frustrating given the price of this Enhanced Edition. 
- There aren't much improvements to call this an Enhanced Edition. Just a few new graphical options... and that's it!

All in all, there is no sense in buying this game right now. You should only buy it if you are planning to play lan coop.
As for the internet coop, the servers may be too far away from your location so lags is the only thing you will enjoy.

To sum up, this relaunch of a famous rpg is failed from the very beginning.  What's the point in making an enhanced edition if it doesn't work properly?",1522486684,1674579582,False,76,2,0.711351692676544189,6,True,False,False

I actually enjoyed the Original Campaign, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark.  But know what you’re getting.  Low graphics. D&D miss mechanics… and some of the most horrible pathing and horrible Henchmen AI that you’ve seen.  No Baldur’s Gate (*I* am controlling the party) mechanism despite BG is a much older game (!).

The extra content (ex: Kingmaker, etc…) is a visual upgrade (as much as the engine can allow), but the “realistic” look impedes the atrocious path finding. So yeah, the rooms no longer look empty boxes with a bit of items as flair. But you’ll tear your hair out by how often you hear the KA-CLUM sound of [your character can’t go there] because of a nicely rendered and furnished room.

Community content is very hit and miss for me, mostly because I like to play with the same character(s) and many the online modules (and some official ones) strip your character back to L1 with no gear.

Thousands upon thousands of hours in worlds created from scratch are readily available. Additionally, the expansion pack Hordes of the Underdark is definitely one of the all-time best D&D video game campaigns. 

Only thing is that nothing about this edition is particularly enhanced; the promised graphical improvements still do not exist, 4 years after release. There is an early test for graphical overhauls available but it's frankly somehow even uglier than the original game, which was made in 2002. It's honestly almost impressive. Only thing they did was bring back online support and help it run in modern resolutions on modern machines, for the most part. Even then, game can still crash often.

Within the game itself are several official campaigns each dozens of hours long, and once you've exhausted the official stuff, or just when you get bored, there's a plethora of mods to be had. Tons of new classes, massively improved graphics, countless community modules each of astounding quality, and more. If I were you, from the get go I'd install the ""Neverwinter Nights HD Art Pack"" and the ""Reborn UI"" mods from the workshop to make the graphics go from passable to charmingly dated. Honestly, with so many community mods and modules, there's no reason to go beyond buying the base game, though I've heard Darkness Over Daggerford is good.

There is a small barrier to overcome in the game, however, in that the original campaign, The Wailing Death, is merely 'okay'. The tutorial is fine, it teaches you the basics and helps you set your preferences, but the opening experience has some stumbles. The story itself is fine, but the gameplay is slow, dull, and spread out. The way it scales difficulty, especially in Chapter 1, is annoying and forces you to complete about half of each quest at a time until you can level up enough to tackle the other half. These issues taper off as your character comes into their own and levels up, but the opening experience past the tutorial is somewhat subpar. Shadows of Undrentide, however, is a solid campaign, and its sequel, Hordes of the Underdark, is an exceptional and entertaining module that makes you feel like a high-level adventurer.

To sum it up: Neverwinter Nights is fun, it's a third of the price of an AAA and will last you at least 3x as long.",1669685841,1669685841,True,1,0,0.50102764368057251,0,True,False,False

To be honest, original campaign is boring while second expansion Hordes of the Underdark is good one. Why is this game is still popular after almost two decades after its release you might wonder. It's because of old BioWare who made toolset and shiped it with game which allowed community to make fanmade campaigns (modules) that exceeds quality of ""stock"" campaigns. I was surprised when Beamdog announced that Enhanced Edition will retain compatibility with community made content which you can check and download here (I hope that I don't break rules here):
https://neverwintervault.org

Beamdog will surely add more features for content creators and make game engine more optimised for current hardware but content made by community even today is the reason why I nominate this game for Labor of Love 2019 award.

P.S. If someone wonder why I have only 3.3h played on Steam its because I preffer GOG version.

EDIT 2020-11-25:
They've added some new things to graphics engine which increase GPU load but they also optimized grass so it will not reduce FPS too much. New reflections looks nice on armors but you can still switch back to classic ones.

EDIT 2021-11-24:
Beamddog remade models and they look much more detailed than original ones but some might not like them. It will probably be added with future updates but you can download it from Beamdog's websites.

A casual passerby might see this game and think, look at that trash can of an outdated game I could never play THAT! For most people, I am sure that's the case. But there are really two types of games, one is a spectacle meant to wow you but each time you play it it gets a little more tired, a little more played out. Then there is the other kind, like NWN, where it doesn't matter if the toons were bouncing potatoes and the buildings looked like a polygon, Its the systems and underlying mechanics that make it special. 

So what is player agency? That means the game should never tell me what kind of fun I'm allowed to have. This isn't about difficulty, its about choice and freedom to create a gameworld or campaign that I enjoy playing. Maybe you don't like starting at level one and, when you play DnD with friends, no one makes you. The same is true here, just pop on DM controls and you can give yourself anything you think is fair to start the campaign. I find special joy that they level up with you. Enter chapter 1 of wailing death at level 3, you get different monster composition and drops then coming in at level 10. This isn't just favorable to the player's personal experience, this is a gift to it. Want to make your own homebrew race or class, do it, why not, its DnD the point are there are no limits. 

Here's where further installments and games like Solasta got it wrong, A campaign in a tabletop setting is only as fun as the amount of options it gives the DM to work with, which is why some modules that are perhaps less popular, if used, get tweaked to high heaven to make them enjoyable. Solasta got some things right, saving your character for other modules, and the ability to level up from the menu to whatever level you want is instrumental in planning out 5e builds. But at its heart its a very streamlined experience, and lacking in its player agency, also moving to a more, perhaps, traditional combat system but one that seems unfair and too random to plan for. 

NWN is basically just a math equation that plays out graphically on screen, on the other hand, and it doesn't roll 19 3s on a D20 in a row either (True story, XC-uh, I mean Solasta) Its certifiably non-bogus. If my numbers add up my character more or less responds as he would in a tabletop game, he slaps HARD. If I have a stupid, unplanned build the game is going to make sure I know that in short order. When I'm trying a new build, sometimes I'll start over multiple times because I'll hit walls and readjust. Like you can't use expertise with the bow, well why is my int so high then, or Blackguard and Bard have Bull's strength that stack with eachother, weapon specialization from fighter is cool and all but....And you rework and you formulate because the game mechanically is deep enough that you can do those things. Compared to the other type of game I mentioned earlier where, you're getting these well rendered experiences, but behind the scenes there's nothing really there.

Onto the bad, For PC, there are obvious aging issues, like your character will inexplicably stop attacking in the middle of a fight or sometimes your guy will spawn through a door facing backward so when you click him forward he has to turn around and clips back through the door. There's entire skill chains, like parry, that don't even work properly and can be a land mine 12 levels and 20 hours into a campaign when you find out its not implemented properly and Beamdog didn't fix it, too busy adding unnecessary characters to baldur's gate I guess.  If you're trying to play crossplay its a freaking nightmare, Beamdog changed the starting area on the OC for the console version so I'm trying to help a friend and we got mad confused before we realized we were looking at two different maps, for no reason, I'm still pretty mad about it. Not to mention he can't join my gameworld on PC, but I can join his, and because he's a new player and our control schemes and menus are so radically different, its nearly impossible to help him figure out the game.

TLDR Verdict - I would say if you're one of those people that's gonna play it and then mealy mouth about how dated it is just buy something else, but if you're looking for a deep, rich, rpg experience with nearly unlimited potential and you've got some cells left in your brainpan and can still use your imagination, buy it.

The original campaign is alright. Not bad, but not great. Shadows of Undrentide is really good. Really fun. It has one of my favorite companions in gaming: Deekin Scalesinger. Hordes of the Underdark is easily the best of the three. More levels! More Deekin! More epic gear! Fun times all around!

If you really want to get the most out of this game, however, the modding community is where its at. Some highlights:

-Return to Ravenloft and its sequel, Ravenloft: Beyond the Gate.
-The Alazander trilogy, which includes seige of shadowdale, crimson tides of tethyr, and Tyrants of the moonsea. don't bother with the original of that third one, just get the dlc.
-Shadowlords, Dreamcatcher, and Demon
-The Aielund Saga
-Penultima and Penultima: Re-rolled

There's so many others I forgot to mention or still haven't played. If its not on the steam workshop, its on the NW Vault. Play this if you love either RPGs, D&D, or good stories.

For a game released back in 2002 that i'm playing mostly for the first time in 2002 - I can't help but feel it is really charming and that it holds up and is still worth playing today.

The visual fidelity is obviously fairly simple, but the game makes surprisingly good use of lighting effects and audio flourishes to make the game rather atmospheric. The writing, like most older Bioware games - is great, whist I see quite a common judgement online that the main campaign is supposedly not up to much, I personally don't share that view (though do acknowledge nostalgia has its hooks in me somewhat). It isn't anything groundbreaking I grant you - it isn't the Revan / Kotor story etc, but it's still very enjoyable and filled with interesting characters. 

A plague being the inciting incident is also somewhat timely given the recent global pandemic we've lived through, but the story progresses, you catch glimpses of villains pulling strings from the shadows, you track down a macguffin or four, slay the evil and save the kingdom. Throughout all these (fairly generic) plot beats you will engage in classic D&D(v3) character building, take interesting side quests - one particularly great where you must pass judgement on a small town which suffered horrors & tragedy that is waiting, disconnected from the flow of time, for someone worthy to assess the situation and pass judgement. You also have a small collection of hired henchmen, each with their own charming, amusing and worthwhile personal tales which reward you with both useful items and ways aiding you in your adventure in avenues you aren't yourself specialised in (thank you Mr. Thief for unlocking every box and door on the continent).

Good old NWN.. at least the price is acceptable even when it's not on sale now.

That's not even including all who are enslaved by them. The DMs of Ravenloft are known to interchange names as to hide the identities of their misdeeds.

The penalty for dying is loosing XP which can delevel a character. Which, this being D&D, is a dice roll.

Whole towns and countryside you can explore. Monsters roaming around. Quests to be had.

You actually feel like going on an adventure instead of a quicker theme park rides most AAA games feel like nowadays. I grew up with games like Fallout 3 and Mass Effect, which are some of my favorite games, but just taking time to immerse yourself and smell the roses feels like more of an afterthought compared to old school games such as this.

That being all said, this is not a casual/beginner friendly experience. The narrative it a lot less flashy, bare bones, and choice driven. The gameplay will kick your ass if you don't prepare yourself and have a decent idea what you are doing at first. I tried playing a Wizard, ignored/didn't know about any companions that could take a beating (the thief you get at first gets his butt kicked in easily), Do not be afraid to lookup a build or beginner's guide. Play it on easy even, I know I do that even for some other older games like this.

Also, most will even say it doesn't even get actually good till the last two expansions Shadows of the Undertide and Hordes of the UnderDark. About to play them myself, but I really am looking forward to them. Good news those two are part of the same character narrative, starting in SotU, and are separate from the main campaign.

Daring to push the limitations of scale and depth, building characters and stories much larger and deeper than had graced our screens in the ages before, Bioware summoned Neverwinter Nights like a celestial being from the pages of AD&D Edition 3.5 and brought them to life in a way that had never been done before. Now with the benefit of more advanced graphics and much faster networking speeds, the classic game returns like an ancient dragon once believed vanquished to put all the lands of fantasy in peril.

Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition is a delightful return to the glory days of CRPGs when developers and writers had to rely on engaging content, immersive stories, and often frustrating puzzles in order to create length instead of building enormous and largely uninteresting worlds full of busy work hidden behind greater than real life visuals. Hampered by the limits of storage media and pricey computing technology, the role playing epics of this era often contained libraries worth of text and lore to wade through, a feature that many current players find tedious and repellent.

Fortunately I happen to have been raised in an age where computers couldn't begin to compete with dice and paper RPGs, and so the often lengthy reads of this genre do not deter me. As such I get to enjoy the loving efforts of the writers who turned this genre of computer games into an adoring tribute to the role playing experience of our shared youths. The only difference between Neverwinter Nights and actually blowing the dust off your old 3rd Edition AD&D books is that a computer handles the often time consuming dice-rolling and arithmetic the game requires, and as such you can concentrate on immersing yourself in a world of delightful cliches and glorious epic tales where the world always hangs in the balance, the hero is inevitably the underdog, and the forces of evil hatch plots so contrived and far reaching that the most hackneyed comic book villain would roll their eyes at the sheer hubris of scheming on such a grand scale.

The Enhanced Edition of NN does an excellent job of porting what could only be called a grand classic of the genre and polishing what I remember to be notably underwhelming visuals. The early days of 3D games were often blocky and oddly coloured, and the technical limitations they had to navigate generally resulted in environments that felt like some twisted fever dream where you cringed at the horrifyingly distorted faces plastered awkwardly on strangely angled heads. With the benefit of modern rendering techniques this new edition manages to smooth out many of the rough edges of the visual experience and give it a less surreal appearance, allowing you to enjoy the content without having to suffer quite so acutely through a universe of pointy puppet people jerking about in that distinctly unnatural manner we remember both fondly and sadly.

With all the modules bundled in one handy package, including the Infinite Dungeons add-on that provides a bottomless supply of procedurally generated dungeons to conquer, this package will provide you with as much entertainment as you care to wring out of it. If you find yourself growing tired of the provided campaigns and somewhat weirdly arranged random dungeons, you have a toolset to work with that will allow you to craft your own adventures, and a grand selection of these player made stories are waiting for you to dive into if you're not so inclined to build your own.

In an experience very much like the tabletop adventures many who are drawn to the Neverwinter fandom know, the multiplayer mode will allow you to team up with other players and embark upon epic journeys to save fantasy lands aplenty from a range of perils as varied and diverse as the creators who bring them to life. The only thing missing is a bottle of soda spilled across a pile of graph paper and dice, causing a scramble of panicked players racing about the table to save a small fortune in merchandise from a fizzy puddle of creeping doom. That and the sound of dice clattering across the table as players pray for the Random Number Gods to bless them with that oft spoken of Natural 20 that they may strike that final critical blow and earn entry into the oral tradition of storytelling TTRPG players relish so much. Remember that time we were all down to less than 10HP and Tom rolled that perfect attack? EPIC! Neverwinter brings those moments to life on your screen, and enables you to share them with players from across the globe.

The most remarkable part of this game is the character creation system, with enough depth and complexity that an almost infinite spectrum of fantasy heroes and heels is possible. From swordplay to spellcraft, stealth to brute force, wizards and warriors, assassins and martial arts masters, holy men and demon worshippers. There's almost literally no limitation but those of your own imagination to the ways you can blend classes, races, stats, skills and gear to customize a hero of legends that is uniquely your own.

If you aren't put off by miles of flowery text, somewhat dated character models, and a frequently cumbersome user interface that results in periodic moments of painful tedium, most notably while selling off unwanted loot, then I implore you to dive into the experience that defined a generation of CRPGs, and influenced all those to follow. With the engine that later brought the Knights of the Old Republic to life the controls will be familiar to new players who missed this unforgettable gem, or those too young to remember the smoking crater this title left on the landscape of the CRPG genre.

Just remember to set aside sufficient time for the almost overwhelming volume of content this bundle provides. This is no mere flirtation with adventure, it's almost a career, one worthy of a dungeon delver bold enough to step into the realm of Bard song and legend that echos across generations.

Do you have what it takes? Will you test your mettle against hoards of goblins, orcs, zombies and dragons, and perhaps even demigods? Do you dare to imagine a world full of perils to terrify and treasures to delight? Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition might just be for you. There's only one way to find out....I'm saying you should have this in your Steam library. Stop reading and go play. Like now.

I have probably put over 10,000 hours into this game over the past 13 years of my life and only recently did I start playing multiplayer where this really shines)

A classic game of a DnD world using 3.5e mechanics. The game is what you make of it, the base game and DLC are all solid but the real gold is the multiplayer servers. I have tried many of the multiplayer servers and they all have their pros and cons. The custom content in the game (not from the workshop) ads tens of hundreds of classes/races/modules to the game to really make a world of your choosing with who you want to play with. Enhanced edition from Beam Dog who picked this game up and revitalized it really is amazing, with graphics that are much better than before, and better structure of multiplayer interfaces. UI changes and redundancies taken out of the game Beam Dog has really put time and effort into pushing this game into the modern era.

Does it look old? Yes it is a game created in 1991 but still has room to make beautifully customized character modules.

704450,120382947,76561198017926274,0,90,2958,0,1540,1660297225,"What a fantastic CRPG. I've always wanted to play it with other people however this game is very niché for today's standards, as either you play it because you're heavily nostalgic, or because you're into the way RPGs were done back in the late 90s and early 2000s. After many failed attempts to get others to play (and finish) it with me, I finally decided to start a singleplayer campaign and ho boy is it awesome.

The game is very well written, although in my honest opinion does have some pacing issues. The first chapter of the game takes place entirely in the city of Neverwinter, and when you're playing a fantasy RPG having to endure endless dirty streets, side alleys, interiors, sewers, etc. just doesn't feel as fun and engaging as it could be. So I do understand why such a little amount of players have gotten past the first chapter. But trust me when I say this: The game only really begins with the second chapter. For one you finally got a proper mystery to unravel, a bunch of villains that puppeteer everything from behind the scenes, many different areas with differing side stories and what feels like a lot more open world. While exploration was fun from the get go, it got a lot more fun then.

Gameplay wise it feels like a great mixture of what you might be used to with CRPG like Baldurs Gate, Pillars of Eternity or the Divinity games but with enough action mixed in (alá Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc.) for it to not feel like a game purely made for tacticians. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of tactic to be had, especially when you're playing with a party of multiple people, or decide to have companions with you. The space-button (which pauses the game and lets you breathe) can be your very best friend, and like in classic CRPG fashion you are almost always presented with multiple ways to tacke a specific problem and I would go as far as to call this game somewhat of an immersive sim.

For example: There's a place you have to get to, but when you get there you find a closed and locked door. Do you find the key and open it that way? Do you pick the lock? Do you just bash the entire door to pieces? Or maybe you look for a different way to enter wholly? There are some quests which only provide one solution (maebels grave for example, don't try to beat him up like I did, he'll just despawn and bug the quest beyond being able to complete it), but most of the time you get multiple choices with almost anything you do. Apart from that everything goes by DnD3.5 rules, so if you are somewhat familiar with the pen and paper RPG and don't expect complete and utter freedom (as every way has to be programmed into the game and the game can't just improvise like a dungeon master would) then you will feel right at home!

The soundtrack is bomb. Some ambient tracks give me the creeps just listening to them, the battle tracks sound heroic and brutal, and the background music never seems like a bad fit and always supports what's happening on screen. The sound design can be a little hit or miss, but honestly for a game as extensive as NWN this is no problem at all. Most sound effects come from Sound CD's that were around during that time, so you'll definitely hear some sounds you've already heard elsewhere, but they never really feel out of place despite that.

Some people complain about this version of the game being bugged, but I don't see any more bugs than I used to playing the Diamond Edition, if anything it feels like it runs more stable. It also looks a lot better than what I remember. Sure graphically you're not gonna be impressed by 2022's standards, but back then this game looked fantastic and in my honest opinion it still holds up today. Some of the art choices made in this game are just beautiful, whether it be the red and brown leaves slowly falling from the trees in the forest or god rays illuminating darker areas. This game used some graphical ""cheats"" that give it an amazing atmosphere even for today's standards.

All in all this game gets a full recommend from me. It's a shame not more people are playing it!",1660125638,1660125638,True,8,1,0.538800835609436035,0,True,False,False

Seems I'm done with this one. And I hope for good this time. I tried grinding through the main campaign for the nth time, in 20 years now, and I just cannot do it. I keep hearing that the expansions are better, and due to my OCD I feel I cannot just skip to those. Maybe I will just skip to those, some day. 

Unfortunately I'm just burned out on this game again. It's just a terrible rpg. As others have said, it's a good implementation of the mechanics of AD&D, but it's just a terrible game aside from that. More of a framework to maybe serve as an alternative to live-action role playing. But a good rpg it is just not. 

The story is as generic and boring as you can get. The writing also puts you to sleep. Even the way the UI is laid out, with the dialogue box relegated to a small window on the edge of the screen, kind of suggests that it's a side concern. I've tried multiple times to force myself to read through most of the dialogue, but my eyes just end up glazing over the text. I've never reached further than the end of chapter 2 (out of 4), and I hear it's pretty terrible throughout the whole thing.

The world and landscape is also terrible. Due to them prioritizing the modular aspect of their levels, the whole world ends up looking like boxes stitched together. It all looks very unnatural. And I don't know which is worse, the outside or the inside environments. But they all looks kind of the same. Blocky landscapes. Just terrible idea. It's shocking that CDPR managed to modify this engine into what they pulled off with the first Witcher. 

The gameplay, while it does offer a good implementation of AD&D for the most while, the way they structured turns and the impact this has on the flow of combat is terrible, especially if you're playing a rogue like I have. Probably amplified by the fact that I've chosen to play with hardcore d&d rules, it leads to most combat situations taking forever to end. Being a rogue I'm pretty proficient at dodging most attacks, but most enemies are also adept at dodging mine. So you waste a lot of time, just doing nothing, just watching your character, and the enemies he's fighting, dance around each other, taking turns for what feels like an eternity. Just awful. Midway through the whole of what I managed to play I just started playing youtube videos while playing the game. That's a really bad sign for a game. 

I can't believe I've been at this game since it was released, back with the original version, 20 years ago, and I still haven't managed to grind through it to at least check it off and be done with it. I feel I may never do that. Maybe I'll return to the expansions in the future. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just not meant to experience this one.

Some of the ""premium modules"" as they call the official campaigns are decent, but the quality of the game comes from user made campaigns using the toolset included in the game.

If you're new to these kinda games (never played baldurs gate, icewind dale, or modern crpgs using dnd or even pathfinder rulesets) maybe play the shitty campaign for the tutorial.

Otherwise:

Aielund Saga, what the developers WISHED the main campaign was
Prophet, if you love incredibly in depth narrative that will leave you thinking about it for years after you play it
Swordflight, if you are very familiar with the ruleset and know how to mostly powergame your character (gruelling gameplay, outstanding module that's considered THE best)

Definitely not a game for everyone. It's a game that has aged like fine wine in some aspects, but has aged like milk on other aspects that are quite hard to ignore.
I would recommend it if you are a very specific kind of player. If you are a casual gamer (no shame in that bro, we all play what we like) or like the ocasional rpg trying to buff as fast as possible, stay away from Neverwinter Nights. You will definitely not get past the middle of Chapter 1.

[u][b]UI & Accessibility[/b][/u]
I've played NWN Diamond Edition (old school) quite a lot and unfortunately I could not do so with my current PC setup because Diamond Edition simply does not support UHD and my resolution and even on the ""next best"" the UI looked so tiny that I could not read anything.

This version fixed all the resolution and UI issues and even expanded on accessibility and game controls. This is what I wanted for so long - how in the world did I miss this release?

[u][b]Cost To Content Ratio[/b][/u]
This is what gaming used to be 20 years ago. You pay less than amount of money you'd pay for a skin or some other cosmetics in a modern triple-A game [i](that's if you're lucky because most likely you can't buy it and need to play the cursed gatcha or lootbox game)[/i] and get at least 100 hours of content - full of engaging stories, characters and stellar game mechanics.

I daresay monetization and content wise the gaming industry did not progress for the past 20 years. On the contrary, it devolved into insanity and the respect for players and our wallets degraded into irrelevance. This game & release is that old school vibe, a fresh air in a room filled with decaying monetization zombies.

[u][b]Solo & Multiplayer - Best Of Both[/b][/u]
Some like original campaigns, some don't - but for every player you can find a community module that suits your interest. And there are a LOT, I repeat - a [b]LOT[/b] of the, created over the last two decades. You won't be left disappointed. 

And that's not all - some of the old ""shards"" (persistent worlds) are still  running and playing with your group is a blast. And with this release you don't need those old hacks for the game, it's all working out of the box. Marvelous!

[u][b]Old Graphics / Age[/b][/u]
Yep, there's no biting around the bush: the game is 20 years old by now. The graphics will be old no matter what. It predated Skyrim by almost a decade and even Skyrim needs several dozens of cosmetic mods to keep it up to the modern standards [i](having a setup of ~700 mods installed for my Skyrim and 3.000+ hours there I can say I'm somewhat above average when stating this)[/i]

You just have to look past what the graphics are. This is not a modern game, you should set your expectations clear. That being said - the release brings in some features to soften the blow somewhat and make it look smoother and prettier - but you still have to understand, those are just like cosmetics & buffs done under the proper light on a granny trying to pose for a pinup - so long as you don't look close by, it's passable.

Whether we were role playing on an online custom module (Thornhollow/The Three Kingdoms, whats up) or having a LAN party at someone's house, this game was constantly in our rotation. 

It's a pretty faithful representation of D&D 3.0. Not only in rules and how the turns work, but in terms of being able to have an actual DM. With this game, you can create a completely custom game from scratch, launch a server, and lord of the players that join; spawning characters/monsters and being able to control their dialogue and temperament. It's an amazing concept that has not been replicated since.

However, the game shows it's age in some areas, and can be a complete turn off for new/young players. The path-finding isn't very good if you go the clicky route, but you can always use WASD controls if that annoys you. The graphics are from a time where 3D games were going through growing pains graphically. Some of it looks beautiful, like the spell casting, and 3D weather effects. Some of it looks pretty rough though, especially the character models. If you have played Knights of the Old Republic or Dragon Age, this game is going to feel very familiar. So I do urge that new players think of this as a sort of spiritual prequel to those games if you're really on the fence.

This is a 10/10 game in my opinion, thanks to my rose colored nostalgia goggles; but this remake gets a 4/10 for the lack of anything new. Increased resolution, resurrected multiplayer servers, and a much uglier title menu. Yay.

The other official content falls within the range of OK to Pretty Good, but the REAL draw here is the Aurora Toolset and all the custom content that the NWN community has been making with it for the last twenty years. This includes several popular online PWs, which act as miniature MMOs, several sprawling multi-act campaigns, and other self-contained modules that let you create character builds quickly and easily. It is truly staggering how many quality, completely FREE, pieces of fan-made content are out there for this old-ass game. 

I put a LOT of time into this game back in the early 2000s, and its kind of sad to think about all of the creative content that was lost when the original Gamespy servers went down, but the fact that this game got an enhanced edition to act as a platform to keep the spirit of this game alive, even after so many years have passed, is nothing short of inspiring. 3.0 DND was definitely NOT the most elegant version of the system, but the somewhat loose interpretation of those rules in this game (the use of hot bars and the focus on a single character makes the game feel more like an older MMO than a faithful adaptation of the pen and paper rules or even other Bioware games like Baldur's Gate) gives NWN a unique feel that is user-friendly and still acts as a solid, if a bit unusual, representation of the rule set. 

That said, it's of hard to tell what Beamdog actually did to make this an ""enhanced"" edition, but in a way it's good that they are able to get it running so seamlessly without significantly altering the vision of the original product.

There were some frustrating parts in it where I felt there should have been more of a choice for some things, but all in all I did mostly enjoy my time playing it.

The gameplay is really outdated and can be quite frustrating in some parts, particularly controlling your companion. You have very little control over their behaviour and from my experience, they would constantly move and switch targets for no reason and getting many attack of opportunities against them.

If you can handle the jank of this old game however, it is a very fulfilling classic RPG. And it's very nice that the dev's for the enhanced edition are still updating it and adding new content despite it being over 20 years old.

In Dungeon Siege you can click (in the map) on an enemy on the other side of a valley full of twists and turns and watch as your PC navigates through the course and quickly dispatches the NPC with a uniquely enchanted weapon with more variety in design. 

On top of that the classes and abilities that would otherwise enhance the game are given little to any explanation. (What is a +1 Enchantment? you don't know? Go read on the internet, because the game won't explain it.) You can't switch classes easily, if at all; so if you want to persuade people with charisma AND pick locks you're out of luck.

Without a posse of friends to go with you, or to bring to life a story through roleplay, most of your time in NWN is spent watching your solo character plod around slowly, and exchange blows with mobs. While there's a fair bit of mechanics and dice rolling going on under the hood, for the player there really isn't much more to do than sit and watch it, reload button at the ready.

I think if you were going in to NWN with friends, the experience would be very different - you could build a balanced party and have a blast riffing off each other, but as a solo player you're limited in viable builds for a single player and when most of the game is simply mindlessly grinding through fields of mobs with old-fashioned AI, it's hard not to wonder why you're bothering.

I say that, because with multiplayer servers and the Aurora Toolset, I would argue this is the original MMORPG.

IN the past I was part of the City of Arabel servers.   Grand events happened that were never part of the design, they simply occured and game play carried on like it was part of the plan.  Modern MMOs just don't have the ability to grow and change based on player actions at this scale.  YOUR actions can make massive changes to the worlds your GMs put forth.

However, this game just really gives me the feeling of good old fashioned immersion and Role-playing I use to have back in the days playing in person table top D&D with my friends. I got the Complete Adventures bundle of this for just under $9 USD. I am so happy I pulled the trigger. I am running around really building up my half-elf cleric. I feel really invested din his development and learning how to play my role based on his abilities. My wife is playing as a human paladin, so she is the muscle and I am her support with the heals and blessings buffs. It was such an awesome feeling when she and I were surrounded by zombies and skeletal warriors to unleash my Turn Undead spell and watch them all fall to the ground in pieces. In the words of Rick Flair......WOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I wound up using the sale to by six copies and gift them to my grown up kids. We are all now playing on our private multiplayer server and other servers just enjoying true 3rd Edition D&D and role-playing without monthly fees, micro-transactions, griefers, trolls, or pay to win punks. It is a true breath of  old-school fresh air. The Workshop community is awesome and there are plenty of servers up. Do not deterred by the dated look of the graphics. They are good enough for you to quickly get used to and easily become lost in the awesome game play, story line, scripted dialogue and world of the Forgotten Realms. This really feels like a labor of love. I just wish I had known that they released this version back in 2018. It would have saved me hundreds of dollars in monthly fees, micro-transactions and other nonsense that these other games use to cover up the true lack of imagination and depth they suffer from.

I played through the first expansion twice while I haven't finished the second. I'd recommend skipping the base game and going straight to the expansion after running the initial section of the base game to get some understanding on how the mechanics work.

Two points I'd like to make are the following:

1. The ""persistent worlds"" servers are fantastic, you hop into either a high or a low pop server and start roleplaying out a character. It's a small scale MMO where you are expected to act out your character with dozens if not hundreds of other players. Running adventures, leveling, improvised writing, and if you are lucky, having the server owners run events for you. All built on the 3e rules. Nothing else out there is quite like it. An obvious contender is Arelith, the largest server, it really is a proper MMO with role-play elements, a good place to start since it's well documented.

2. Some of the modules from the NWN vault are actually some of the most engaging CRPGs out there. You can find full games freely available for download such as Aielund Saga (A masterpiece).

and..
it fails in that promise, you never see the modules you download.
HUUGE fail.
just another company taking advantage of DnD fans.

Edit:
So, have been experimenting and trying to get the modules and PWs to work.
My advice, (because access to the modules from the vault is priceless)
do not move files like alot of folk are advising.
i have found re-verifying files will fix alot of workshop problems.
and if it doesnt, move to another module.
you can download mods in the workshop (but thats the least playable chance), try first to find it in game with the curator system (couldnt get the neverwinter vault tool mod to work)
Seems there are multiple places the game saves modules,
and there are multiple places to load a new game as well.. go figure.
reloading steam/restarting comp helps too when you get the portrait bug (game crash).
oh, and also..
alot of mods do not run off the base game, check the beta listings to see a possible match.
'development' matches alot of them.
anyways, an evolved thumbs up.
so initially yes, i am not happy to see the module system broken like this.
but after being extremely donkey stubborn with the verifying of files, you can get modules to load.
so thats worth the price of the game of sale.

EDIT2: NOT WORTH THE PRICE OF THE GAME IF THE MODULE SYSTEM DOESNT WORK.

The graphics may not be a lot compared to some games now, but with a bit of time and effort with scripting, and you can even import and easily share your own 3D models, it is very extensible and is understated as a game. 

People at Beamdog used to work on this at BioWare, and it shows, and it's still supported in development.

Check out other places to find it cheaper, and there are a lot of player created modules beyond the single player ones included with the game (which I believe you get the original plus the two expansion packs you did have to pay for, shadows of undrentide and hordes of the underdark, or something).

The second plot (Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of Underdark) is about you being a student to a powerful trainer of adventurers, and going to to collect stolen relics, overcome your very master, become the Reaper, and ending up defeating Mephistopheles, after he tricked a Drow Queen into luring you, so he could make you trade places with him in Hell, which you must escape with the help of penitent souls, evil deals or sheer willpower.

It has 2 very decent, classic adventurer stories, that you could expect from 80s, 90s and 2Ks D&D scenes.
One about saving the communal in spite of individual loss, and another about growing up to challenge Evil, even when it is of a much higher order than your own mortal nature.

It is not very character heavy, neither in your main PC, nor in your party members, but it has enough good interactions with the vast majority of the characters designed in the game, good combat, deep character building, and a lot of philosophy (Is pain of self worthy of inflicting pain in others? Is there truth in every lie? Does a lie that kills one man and save hundreds of others, worth the death of a good natured innocent?).

I never really like BG much, as the characters you were given always were very poorly built, and that artificially made the content harder than it should be.
Much did I prefer the Icewind Dale series, and indeed Neverwinter Nights 1 (this game) due to allowing you to build efficient characters that actually can beat the game in multiple ways, while still giving a sense of achievement.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to ANYONE, that likes RPGs. It is an infinite game, with infinite adventures, great replayability, unforgettable characters and dungeons.

Playing now in it's enhanced version is amazing - the experience I wish I had been able to have 20 years ago. I've been playing the main quest on PC and hordes of the underdark on my phone (it's surprisingly good on android - and I normally hate full games on touchscreen) - looking forward to spending many more hours on this one - with the community and official modules you may well find that game that you never truly leave behind. 

Sure, its UI is a bit old and clunky, but as long as you're comfortable with dice rolls and DnD stats, there's *still* not much better than Neverwinter Nights. It's an absolute classic.

I played this game when it came out, and have nothing but fond memories of it, even as the system can feel dated in some of the ways more recent isometrics and RPGs have instituted quality of life changes (I'm looking at you fiddly inventory system). Reviewing NWN:EE is a bit tricky, since in many ways the game itself is a dated product from the early 2000's. The system of 3rd edition can be a bit awkward to learn at times if you are unfamiliar with it, and even being familiar with it there was plenty that I had to relearn after all these years. But if you are willing to take the time, or look around the variety of online forums on the game for help, NWN can be a fantastic time. One of the best things about this game as a platform, is that you can make a character and import them into new modules you want to play - you can take your one PC through any number of stories, encountering increasingly difficult foes and experience the ridiculous (and ridiculously fun) moments of epic level play. It's not a continuity of stories, so much as a continuity of character that is possible here, and that can be very satisfying in its own way. That said, what can really name NWN shine *is* the stories, and especialyl with NWN:EE, there is no shortage of those available! 

NWN was a fantastic translation of 3rd edition D&D, and while the original campaign can be a bit lack luster, NWN:EE is more than just the base game - it's the expansions, premium modules, and additional community content that has a wealth of wonderful adventures big and small.

I picked this up looking mainly to be able to play Darkness over Daggerford, a fantastic homage to the original Baldur's Gate game that I never knew about when I was younger and was only aware of the official instalments (core game and the two retail expansions). I loved every second in DoD, and went on to play through Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark almost immediately after. Having sunk nearly 80 hours into those three alone, this felt SO very worth it!

Originally, this game represented a marked departure from Bioware's previous RPGs: gone were the pre rendered 2d backgrounds and full party of well-developed characters, replaced by modular 3d enviroments and simple AI-controlled henchmen. 

The base campaign released with the game was mediocre at best, but the real draw was the powerful toolset that allowed the community to produce high quality modules (both for single-player and multiplayer) for many years to come.
Bioware themselves clearly became more familiar with their own new engine over time and managed to release two solid expansion packs (SoU and HotU) that are well worth a playthrough.

Nowadays the Enhanced Edition is arguably the best way to experience all of this: while obviously not a huge departure from the original, it nevertheless adds many welcome additions such as scalable UI, improved lighting (especially for interiors) and several gameplay tweaks (for instance, polymorphed druids now benefit from unarmed feats).
Moreover, the new online infrastructure (which also allows you to download the required custom content in-game without visiting third party websites) has revitalised the multiplayer scene after the old servers were shut down a while ago.

If you can get the base game with its first four DLC campaigns during one of the frequent sales I'd say it's great value for your money considering the wealth of content you gain access to. (I would advise against buying the ""Digital Deluxe"" edition though, the soundtracks are unnecessary and the ""Dark Dreams of Furiae"" module is just plain awful)",1624976137,1641772861,True,25,0,0.750303864479064941,0,True,False,False

Think about that for a moment, dozens of hours of your free time go to waste overnight, with no real explanation. Beamdog suggests removing your save files from the saves folder, which is a genius idea, but that also renders the entire point of using the load game option moot. You won't crash the client if there are no saves in your folder to crash it! So have fun making a new character every time you want to play, have fun being level 1 in every module with no character to load because you can't have saves in your saves folder, and have fun trying to go through the entire main storyline without ever turning off the game because when you do that poof! It's all corrupted and you have to start over again.

Addendum: There were no mods installed at the time of this review, the game was fully vanilla. I did a fresh install anyway and have made it a point to move my save files whenever I make a new character, and also whenever I decide to resume a game in progress. The extra tedium involved is a form of nostalgia in itself going back to when I was a child, but not necessarily the kind I was going for when I bought the game.

Hack and slash,beat em up as a monk,cast powerful damaging spells,be stealthy and fight like an assassin,shapeshift,necromancy,summon elementals,animal companions,have a familiar,and can even summon a giant demon.
If you are completely new to D&D though leveling can take a bit to understand.
You can mix classes together and pick skills and abilities.
Some skills and abilities go good together and some don't.
How you level really matters. Pick a skill say at level 5 and not much changed but say wait till your 10th and the skill also gave you extra bonuses.
There are lots of guides and many OP character builds out there.
If you are a wizard spells must be memorized.
Sorcerer's don't have to memorize.
Spells are limited based on intelligence.
If you run out you'll have to rest 24hrs to recover them.
This can make it lopsided for pure casters.
But so many mods out there you can definitely change a lot of this system.
Completely modular you can make your own campaigns with this.
Can even make persistent worlds which are like smaller scale mmo.
There's a steam workshop full of mods for this.
The game has been around a long while so there are even more mods and content on over the internet.

Already had the Diamond Edition, which I didn't touch for the last 10 years or so, so I was wondering if it's really worth getting the EE here on Steam. For the sale price I didn't really mind though, so I got it and told a few friends about it who are into this sort of stuff and also bought it. I had extensively played single player back in the day, and tried one or two persistent worlds, but for some reason, we never played simple modules Coop as a group with friends. We've now decided to try just that, and it's really a lot of fun, and a great option to spend an evening online with friends. 

The EE makes hooking up for multiplayer really easy, and everything works flawlessly. I host a game, and the others can simply join via server browser. Don't know if it was the same in the older editions, but I read that Beamdog improved multiplayer, and it really just works. Also saving and loading in a group works perfectly. The other players have to rejoin the server after a load, but it's a quick and easy process. Also their characters are stored within the savegame, which is great, and makes for easy consistency. A new EE feature which is very practical is to be able to give a player dungeon master privileges for a short time, to transport all players to the same spot (if sbd got lost or joins with a new char), or do the occasional level up, in case somebody missed a session. 

Also what's great is the curated content (community modules selected by Beamdog and made available to play through the main menu). First of all, it makes it very easy to get a session going, especially with friends who are not so technically inclined and can just download new modules with one mouseclick. Secondly it made me rediscover the Eye Of The Beholder modules, which I had come across back in the day already. Back then I found them difficult to get into, but now as multiplayer it makes for a fun old-school experience. 

All in all I am in love with NwN again. I used to think that it's such a great framework for old-school DnD CRPGs, but as most I was a bit disappointed with the actual content and playing experience. Now this changes a lot, after 20 years of added community content, and especially with the accessibility of Coop multiplayer, which is simply a lot of fun. I'm still also looking forward to check out a few single-player modules, and who knows, maybe even look for a persistent world again, this time to join as a group of friends.

Played many times single and multiplayer on its original release, Neverwinter Nights is Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 Edition Ruleset based Roleplaying game. With the enhanced editions, it made compatible, playable on modern machines but it doesn't end there. Engine is updated and using better graphics as much as the core code allows. So it still looks old and still may be unbearable for some people but if you are after ""roleplaying"" it's ok. 

Aside from nostalgia effect, game has 1 vanilla campaign with lots of cliches and expansions with more interesting storylines. Rules adaptation is quite good and that makes it quite replayable. 

NWN may still the most flexible RPG around when it comes to custom content and modding and that made it lifespan this long. 
Custom items? OK
Custom Class, Race, Feats? OK
Custom Campaigns? OK
Interconnected custom campaigns with fully online persistent worlds..OK. (wait ..what?) 

+++Setting: DND 3.5 , lots of feats and lots of imbalance going around. That's what a tabletop player loves. Making your own strange combo to throw the campaign off-balance. 

++(+)Gameplay: Interface is easy even with all the dice rolls going around. You can issue orders, pause the game, cancel so forth. Original campaigns are quite nice, think vanilla as a learning curve for non -dnd players.
Extra plus comes from modding / custom content. It takes a while to learn it but it may change your experience all together. Because it is rare to play as a Rakshasha or as a True Necromancer brownie LoL. 

+/-Graphics: Well this Game is OLD. Nothing Beamdog can do unless they remake it from scratch so, that's how it is. With the latest HD patch , it's using its engine to its limits i guess to atleast look a little LESS old :) 

+Technical: I play on Ultrawide, with Soundblaster ZXR and 16 thread CPU, Windows 10, not even the hint of these existed when the game first released still no bugs, no crashes. Works like charm.

As some already stated, this enhanced edition has so little in terms of enhancements. Servers are back so you can easily play it online again, what is not something appealing to people like myself, which prefer the amazing single player experience. The latest update brought some enhancements to the lightning system, a nice visual tweak that really “shines” when you consider the effect on the armor sets. For those of you playing on old hardware, reducing the number of lights rises considerably the frames per second. 

       As for the game itself, I can only comment about what I have played, and that was the whole main campaign and a big part of the Shadows of Undrentide expansion. The main campaign has a formula that repeats itself: a hub where lots of conversation happens and quests are given, then four locations to explore and solve the given quests. It is simple and works. The story is well presented and written (there are even academic papers about Neverwinter’s writing), even if sometimes it is nothing particularly exceptional. The soundtrack is amazing, some scores will stick with you forever. I could go on and on telling you about everything which, in my opinion, makes this game a masterpiece. A particular instance of its beauty is the fact that in Shadows of Undrentide you have some optional riddles to solve. “OK, that isn’t anything special!”, you would say. I have to agree. What makes that special, to me at least, is the fact that the third riddle can be solved easily with combinatorics. Being a math person, I can not do less than praise a game that brings math to the table. 

	So to end this review, here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
	No micro-transactions;
	No loot-boxes;
	No season or battle passes;
	Game is actually a finished product, not an early access one;
	No Hollywood celebrity;
	No pre-order;
	Great soundtrack;
	Amazing D&D implementation;
	Great story, specially so in the expansions;
	At least one instance where you can use mathematics;
	100% Bags of Holding;

Cons:
	A bit slow-paced;
	Steam achievements all with the same icon;
	Not much to justify the “Enhanced” part of the title;
        [update] The game has horrible memory leak problems. You'll be able to play smoothly for a wile 
        depending on how much RAM you have and the graphics quality.

I've brought in friends that, while they haven't been thrilled with the somewhat dated look of the game (I mean, again 20 years), have been blown away by the communities and the platform this game provides for storytelling and roleplay.

That  said the game system is still cool.

I like that the rules are nearly 100% correct tabletop D&D, made into something that runs like if it were a real-time RPG (though it actually is round-based like the original D&D.) What I mean is the game engine makes all the D&D dice rolls and calculations so fast that the game never slows down but  runs through like real-time. However if you want you can hit the pause button, effectively changing the game into round-based combat if you so feel.

This sets the game apart from modern MMRPGs insofar as those have much simplified rules and character-building systems compared to real D&D. NWN on the other hand retains the nearly unlimited versatility of the original. 

An absolutely great thing about the game is the dev-toolkit that comes with it (called NWtoolset). It allows you to build your own adventures, game modules or even persistent worlds, complete with a built-in script editor. Creating stuff with the toolset is easily as much fun as the game itself. Also it means that the player base has already created a huge amount of custom content, worlds and adventures for the game.

Some player-created persistent worlds are as rewarding to play on as any modern MMRGP.

[b]Pros[/b]:
 - Good mix of light and dark themes makes for a fun story.

 - It really feels like I'm back playing 3.5e with miniatures in my dorm at 2am.

 - Interesting, varied characters - particularly as more modern games have fewer evil party members, it's fun to have the entire spectrum of D&D's alignment system.

 - Characters develop and change in natural ways, particularly as the game progresses.

 - I can cast fireball.

 - Expansions well worthwhile. Unlike smaller, more cosmetic DLC, these expansion packs are their own campaigns and practically sequels.

 - Enough information to make a solid and fun character without a background in D&D.

[b]Cons[/b]:

 - Hard to ""go back"" - while Beamdog has done a good job updating resolutions and compatibility, older games had lower usability budgets. There will be mildly annoying elements (the ""?"" spell description, for example. Why not use a hovering pop up?)

 - Lots 'o reading. If you don't enjoy books, you won't enjoy this game. (You might also not read this review, soooo. . .)

 - Voice acting - While only introductory lines and cutscenes are voice acted, the actors are middling.

 - Henchmen could use a little more character growth in the base campaign.",1633213342,1633213342,True,20,0,0.698100745677947998,0,True,False,False

There is enough content in it's very first chapter to sustain many people, much less the rest of the original game.  On top of that it has multiple DLCs that add many more hours of game play.

With all the options, races, classes, feats, weapons, armours, items, spells, online and user created content, which you yourself can customize, it has infinite hours of enjoyment.  And they still to this day continue to update it.

I can not recommend the game enough.  If you are even remotely into RPGs this game is worth it.  If a D&D fan, simply no excuse not to have it.  Anyone else, I think you would still enjoy it.

When I started my first file I was really distracted by the graphics and the clunky UI. I almost gave up on the tutorial area.

About an hour in, something clicked in my brain. The next day, I couldn't stop thinking about playing and went back to the game. Since then, it's all been a glorious blur. This game is a masterpiece.

Of the two expansion campaigns, Hordes of the Underdark's campaign is a vast improvement on the original's. Shadows of Undrentide's campaign was good, but I have only ever played it once or twice. 

But the real lure of NWN is not the campaigns, but the custom content. With a vast amount of fan-made content, there is plenty of modules to try and lose oneself in. Once that is done, or you wish for something different, multiplayer is there to greet you. Whether it is to grind levels and try out that new crazy powerbuild or to stand around in a town square under a tree for literal hours on end roleplaying, there is something for everyone. It is this fact that has me coming back to NWN, even after all these years.

I bought the enhanced edition for 2 euro when it was on sale recently and you're given level 15 characters. I've been using one to sail through the game and I'm enjoying it although now it's a bit too easy.
It's the standard cheesy D&D fare. You're a hero, solve everyone's problems. The combat is the standard for this genre with pause-play combat. 

For a game this size I assume 22 hours isn't long enough to give a proper in depth review but I would recommend it if you're even half interested, at a reduced price, since it's old.

Edit after playing for a longer time: After playing for a much longer period I've really seen the appeal of this game. Once I finished the original campaign, now called, The Wailing Death, I played the even better expansions. Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark. Then moved onto custom content made by other players. There is a near infinite library of content to download and play for free. 

The multiplayer is also good with persistent worlds where you can create a character and role play them along with other players. I'm sure in it's hayday there were many more servers and players but there is still a selection to be had and the bigger servers have around 100 people at peak play times.

Further edit: I'm addicted to this game. I bought it back in December or January and have been playing it since. Exclusively. No other games new or old, hold or has held my attention for as long as this game. Which is probably attributed to the fact that it is as near to a tabletop Dungeons and Dragons game you are going to get in a digital format except one of those simulators or sites people play on. The difference is this is all done in text and doesn't need subscriptions to a service or any additional hardware like a microphone.

There really is no replacement for other people playing as the other characters. No developer can code for the RP and stories people come up with on the fly.

Firstly, NWN itself. 
While the Original campaign is flat and uninspired, the expansions are well worth playing, even now. On top of that the modding community has had a great many years to create content, from modules to massive amounts of additional content like equipment models, prestiege classes, new spells, races.Any part of the game that could be modded has been modded, and that is pretty much all of it. CEP (Community Expansion Pack) and PRC (Player Resourse Consortium) are the shining examples of content mods that bring a lot to the game. This means there are a lot of really good modules out there that make the official content look like kindergarten projects. 

Now the steam/enhanced version. 
This is garbage...1/10. No evidence of work on graphics. The best workshop modules are broken. It crashes frequently. Really...don't bother.

Your best option is to try to find a version of the  Diamond edition (Good Old Games provides one when you buy the enhanced game), then, visit the neverwinter vault website, check the top modules lists, and download those. While you are at it, if you are up for a bit of work, check out the CEP (1 & 2)...needed for many modules, and the PRC pack. PRC pack needs to be added to modules without it (includes program to do that), and to play the custom races or start custom base class from L1 you need a custom character creator. Also it doesn't tend to work well with CEP, but for non-CEP modules it really adds a tonne of fun!

In conclusion, its sad how badly the steam enhanced project has gone...looks like some idiot got the licence and thought ""its an old game, well just fiddle with it a bit and stick it on steam and make some free cash"". They didn't even bother to look at the way the game was structured to work with its file system. Massive fail :P


**        Keeping an eye on the game, have not given up on it ;)        **


UPDATES

1 - 5/02/2020
Played Wyvern Crown to just past the Joust. Game crashed twice in a row when trying to enter castle. 

Played Origonal NWN campaign. Made it part way through Chapter 1. Completed Blacklake with no trouble. Crashed shortly after entering peninsula district.

Graphics a little shinier perhaps, but still not really anything special. 

Workshop modules still have issues.

Still not really any better than NWN Diamond in my opinion.

2 - 21/04/2020
Started a character in xp1 SOU. Plan was elven fighter/rogue/wizard. 
Created character as fighter, the added some xp and tried to level some rogue and wizard. 
Rogue went ok as far as I could tell. Wizard didn't have access to selecting spells, or to any spell caster feats, such as combat casting, spell focus, spell penetration.

Completely reinstalled, deactivated ALL mods, tried to start new game using  OC1 Prelude, tried same process...same fail.

Graphics still not really standing out vs diamond version of game i still occasionally play. Some graphical features but not really enough to make up for breakages

Still big thumbs down I'm afraid...

3 - 27/07/2021
Latest check in on the game. It seems to finally be worthwhile.

Started OC1, Completed Peninsula district so far. No crashes. 
Graphics are better, marginally in terms of bling, but in terms of performance they are smooth and problem free.
I will keep running on oc1 and check back if anything notable either way pops up.

There is now support in game for third party modules. I consider third party content to be essential due to the amount of awesome work done by the nwn community over the years. Currently testing this and will check back when I have given it a look (has one of my favourite sagas, so excited to try this.)

CHANGING TO THUMBS UP. 
I consider the game now to be worth spending money on...will keep monitoring ;)

Did notice a little issue, not big as many people won't try to do this, but for those of us who like to use dev console to fiddle...we are a little restricted: Started a rogue. At Ch Level 2 took level of wizard. 
Had modded INT to 190. couldn't pick spells, had to use recommended button to get them (all of them of course). 
Upon opening spell book to select memorised spells, L1 memorisation squares didn't appear. 
After fiddling with int for a bit..taking L1 wiz a few times it turned out that int 130+ breaks wizard spell casting, while Int 120 does not. 
As I said, not a big issue (Int 100 still provides plenty of extra magical power for wizzy!! hahaha) but worth noting. ;)",1570452756,1627317722,True,0,0,0.660732924938201904,10,True,False,False

Overall I have actually found it to be pretty stable, and while there are not many graphical improvements, there have been a lot of improvements on the backend that allows for creators of custom content to do much more than they could before. Since this game from the start has essentially been about custom content creation first and the official content second, this is a net positive.

So, my recommendation is that if you love Neverwinter Nights and want to get into it again, or want to play through some of the newer content that people are making, or if you want to DM with your friends, then you should get this game. 

However, this is an evolutionary development, not a revolutionary one, so if you are looking for Neverwinter Nights Remastered, do not get this game, at least not for a few years. Currently it does not look like Beamdog are going to release any content in the near future that take advantage of the changes they have made to the game engine, and likely any remastering will be done by the community. So you will only be able to enjoy the remaster potential of this edition if you are making your own custom content. If you are making custom content though, or wish to find texture and model overrides, the place to look is on the vault, https://neverwintervault.org/, as most things have not been posted on the Steam Workshop.",1625183259,1626666595,True,0,0,0.472222238779067993,0,True,False,False

It looked like a LOT of fun, and I kept asking if I could play. Now, letting your eight year old play this game is *probably* a bad idea, and I would not recommend it, but my dad clearly did not heed those warnings future-me would give, and let me create a character in the original campaign. This, of course, would be a mistake... because now I play Dungeons & Dragons on the regular, and have played through all three official campaigns at LEAST once each.

It's been fourteen years since the first time I played Neverwinter Nights, and I still play it on the regular. I would say it's one of the best video games I've ever played. Maybe the graphics aren't the best, maybe they don't stand up to games like Dragon Age: Inquisition or whatever... and maybe the writing in the first campaign isn't too great... but this is an excellent game, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a D&D fix, a replacement for Dragon Age, or just a fun game that you can play with friends.

Now, don't let my, like, 87 hours on Steam playing this game fool you... I owned it BEFORE it was on Steam, and BEFORE there was an Enhanced Edition, and I've probably played 300+ hours of Neverwinter Nights total over those aforementioned fourteen years, so really, I'm like the best person to ask if this game is good. And... it is! Maybe eight year old me, and ten year old me, and thirteen year old me, and fifteen year old me didn't play it ""properly"" (which is to say, I ignored most side quests, I used ample cheats, I usually played a druid/shifter/weapons master with a bow... what a weird combo), but really, if you can't just mess around and have fun with a game, what ARE you doing?

You're allowed one NPC party member at any time, adding onto this Both that one party member and any summon/pet your class may let you have (which of course you can only have one of as well) cuts your XP gain down by a significant margin. 
And its not like its a technical limitation either, as dungeon siege was released early the same year as this. while having the ability to recruit a multitude of NPC's into your party (I should also add that you can acess their inventory in DS which you cant do here in NWN).

My partner is a low-IQ half orc who betas the shit out of everything. We make a good team.

Lady Pepperoni also has a real nice rack.

This is a 're-master' of a 20 year old game. For the first 3 hours of play-time, the controls and menus made me swear a lot. They have not really modernized those.

Use to it now though. 

Apart from a few quirks (nothing game breaking), online co-op works well.

20 hours in, the campaign is intriguing. It's a story about a plague that is ravishing your fair city. Quarantine is not working, everyone is arguing over how to fix the situation. Rich twats are hoarding resources. Timely.

This is a classic CRPG with a fresh coat of paint. It's a little more punishing than most modern RPGs (even on Normal difficulty). The writing is Bioware in it's prime. If you like that sort of thing, then you could do much worse. I look forward to the ~100 more hours of play-time I can expect to get out of this title.",1625110533,1625110533,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

This is rule set 3.5, maximum levels are 40 total.
Many sub sets,
Fighter, Ranger, Paladin tanks, for example
So, healer or caster you have more than 1 choice as well.
Plus subsets within those subsets, Clerics with Wizard spells, or extra undead turning, for example. With many more options.
The game has depth, replay ability, quasi-open world. You'll find yourself considering the best classes to play as a multi-class character. Paladin/Sorcerer, Rogue and almost anything else....the combos are many.
The real fun of this game is that as the hours melt away playing...you'll want to play it more.

I bought the game here so that if I ever lost or damaged my original, I will still have it.

ill be honest, if your looking for raw 3.5e dnd games, then this is it, like it or not, and there isnt much to say otherwise about it in all honesty. there is maybe only 1 other pure 3.5dnd vgame i can think of and its not close to this or neverwinter nights2 in terms of polish. this game has its problems but does what it needs to do for those who need/want to play it. the stories in it arent masterpieces which is a shame i guess but it doesnt matter much for most i would say, the people playing this game are people who want to play DND3.5 and not many others-and if you are one of the others, get ready to read numbers that are barely explained to you (i dont even know if this game has a in depth tutorial about 3.5 rules thinking about it lol, there might be and im just really dumb but i think there was only the essentially game controls tutorial area and thats it.) as its not very beginner friendly. (though its better than learning via 3.5 books LOL)

its really hard to say something about this game because the audience that will play it knows about it and those that dont and do buy it will 95% of the time not enjoy learning how to play it and then going though the not so fun starting story chapter of the game or get carried along into it as my friend did for me to get me into it, though i did have some starting knowledge of 3.5 so it wasnt that bad. i would say get it on sale if you still want to try it and dont have a friend dragging you into it, if 1.9h in you are out of the tutorial in the first chapter and are dead inside and dont understand any of the numbers of character building, then its a fair refund.",1624303049,1624303049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's rather disappointing that it took Beamdog 3 years to do this, but at least this game is readable now. Hope that the map and chat windows could improve soon.

Update 4/5/2021: The UI scaling issue has finally been solved, but the build isn't stable yet and it's still in development. You can find the build in Properties -> Beta. The map size is still inconsistent and will change depending on where your character is located, and the chatbox is still far too wide. It is possible to split the chat window and minimize the one on the right, although resizing the width of the chatbox is still not possible.

Please Beamdog, just redo the UI and be done with it. I can't stand to play your otherwise fantastic game because the UI is so horrendous that my eyes feel sore. I'm playing on a 1920x1080 screen, 1x is too small and 2x is too large, and we can't input any decimals for some reason. This has been a problem since release, and 3 years later you still haven't fixed it. Why not just allow us to resize every single UI element like MMORPGs? It fixes your UI-scaling problem completely, and yet after so many updates you've neglected basic accessibility elements and UI design. What's the point of playing your game if it's actively making me miserable? If someone knows a mod that solves this problem, please let me know.

NWN really provides a type of gameplay and pacing that I have yet to really find in more modern RPG titles. Its very strategic and decisive style of play stays true classic to DnD fashion. 

This isn't a fast-paced hack-and-slash game with high definition detail. It's more of an interface in which you are given just enough information and visual cues to piece together the scene around your character. If you're expecting high-end graphical quality, this isn't the game for you. If you like the idea of a DnD tabletop session autonomously visualized and operated for you to interact with, in a 3D environment, this may actually suit you.  

NWN:EE doesn't have a lot of difference to NWN: Diamond Edition. Graphic enhancements are minimal, and barely noticeable, aside from increased support for higher-resolution screens. My main motivation for getting NWN:EE although I still have DE, is more for the new multiplayer servers, and just overall easier installation. If you're able to track down servers in Diamond Edition fine, and have the fixes place to run it on a newer machine, then Enhanced Edition may be redundant for you. 

If you've never played before, and graphical quality isn't a top priority for you, then NWN: EE is a great way to quickly install the game and jump in.

Enhanced Edition is fully compatible with any modules designed for the original version, and that also includes the mobile Android version as well. I can pretty easily transfer my save data and modules (maps) between the game on my phone and the game on my PC with really no issues, so far at least.

Edit as of April 2021: It would appear the mobile versions are currently lagging behind, so newer modules made with the current PC toolset won't work on the mobile port. Hopefully this will get resolved with some future update to the mobile game.

The module/map editor is fairly robust and easily workable, using tile sets and built-in tools to make creation relatively simple. 

TL;DR: Get it if you don't have Diamond Edition already, like DnD, and you don't care about how shiny or pretty it is.",1545798767,1621559439,True,4,0,0.523613095283508301,0,True,False,False

Neverwinter Nights is famous and widely regarded an almost classic. The gameplay, story, dice rolls, stats, classes, etc. are direct game interpretations of the D&D board games, problem is they left you to be the Dungeon Master, almost that is. What I mean is the story is predetermined and has a path that cannot be changed, but a lot of your experience inside the quests will need your imagination to truly be appreciated. It is a simple main story, I remember the beginning much more than the ending, which normally it's not a good sign, I got invested in the beginning, the game pulled me in, but the more answers I got the less interested I was, it wasn't a bad experience, but can't say I was overjoyed at the end.
Most quest are simple quests, inside a non linear wide location with linear maps.
The biggest problem is the amount of traps and locked chests and doors, if you don't like a rogue class you will need the only rogue companion in the game and you can only choose one, this makes the others non viable which in turn makes the replayability almost non existent, with the exception of going through everything again but with a different class.

I did so many playthroughs, spent so many hours trying and failing to make custom campaigns in the Aurora Toolset, and it's probably one of the games I can give the most credit to to making me want to make my own fantasy game worlds.

Sure, the original vanilla campaign may be kinda boring at times, but the two expansions that came out after it - or with it if you got the Diamond Edition like I had - are downright masterpieces that are well written, fun and offer so many opportunities for any kind of character you create to shine in unique ways. My personal favorite was definitely Shadows of Undrentide, especially for introducing literally the best character ever written in any game ever: ma boi Deekin.

The game kind of plays almost like a hybrid real-time and turn based RPG with some randomness involved, because it's literally trying to emulate DnD rules: you have dice rolls done between ""turns"" that determine your ability to hit, how much damage you deal, etc, and you can affect these chances through your stats. You have a ton of hotkeys to work with and you can queue up actions, so it really does play in a unique way that I don't think I've ever seen done since. Since it's DnD rules, it really is one of the truest forms of RPG you can get in a video game. Those stats seriously matter.

And yeah, the aforementioned Aurora Toolset the game came with means that there's basically infinite fanmade content for you to play through thanks to the Steam Workshop and older sites, and I'm sure there are still some people playing online to this day on custom campaigns and such. I never really played online - maybe someday - but the amount you get here for just $20 as a singleplayer game is insane.

This game was Bioware and Obsidian at their finest, and it's sad that we may never see a game of this calibre ever again from either of them. This is a true classic that you should have in your library if you like RPGs, and the game being as old as it is means it should run like a dream for most PCs these days.

Though the years haven't been friendly to this game graphically, you can have a look in the workshop to patch things up a bit (well, in this case quite a lot compared to the vanilla graphics), so that your eyes don't start to tear everytime you look at the screen.
Played it for years when it came out 2002.
OC: Storyline isn't really great, but for me the main thing is leveling my character,
SoU: Better Story, BUT - ended OC lvl 15 (Ranger, Fighter classes level slower for the first 8 character levels),
ended SoU lvl 17 - measly 2 levels more! It feels a bit odd...
HoU: Nice Story (in my humble opinion), it's the culmination of things as it should be. Here you'll find out your characters mettle.
The character leveling paths and options may be a bit overwheelming if you are a new player (or haven't played any D&D games yet), but the more rewarding when things turn out nicely!

-Game installs and runs easily on Linux, no extra steps necessary
-I never witnessed any bugs (though others have said there are many)
-Smooth gameplay, no graphical or control hiccups. Looks and sounds as well as you would expect NWN to look and sound on modern hardware.
-All expansions and premium modules included
-Server browser is working, and servers are somewhat populated

CONS:
-There are wonderful enhancements for online play in general, but few enhancements to graphics.
-There is no new content in terms of portraits, music, spells, etc. No new modules or playable content either. Anything new is sold separately for $3-10 each.

NOT TESTED:
-I only played an hour or so of the campaign. I've only tested one PW so far.
-I didn't test any mods, community packages, .haks, etc. Strictly vanilla.
-I didn't test the worldbuilder.
-I didn't test any of the content available in the bundle

SYNOPSIS:
As far as porting the game to Steam, making it functional on modern hardware, and reviving the server browser goes, they did an excellent job. There are significant improvements relevant to modders and hardcore PWers added, but I like many others purchased the game under the assumption that ""all-new enhanced features"" included improved graphics. The developers claim to be working on future graphical enhancements, but the list I've seen seems pretty ambitious, and this is NOT an early access title. This is a finished product, and has been for almost a year. In general the game doesn't feel like something you should pay for if you still have your old CD keys.

TL;DR:
NWN:EE offers an NWN client which is stable and multiplayer-compatible. Beyond that, there isn't much new being offered. I would only recommend buying this game when it goes on sale for $10 or so.",1551325702,1618694849,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

***NOTE*** that save files and such for this game save in your user's Documents directory in Windows 10. Anti-virus solutions, even Windows Defender, might try to restrict the game's access to this folder. This can cause your save games to be deleted! Set up exclusions for the nwmain.exe process as well as the Documents\Neverwinter Nights directory. I lost a few hours of progress this way and learned the hard way.

TL:DR version of this review: This is BioWare's best game ever, and this and its sequel went farther than every other RPG in its attempt to become the ultimate RPG that ""has it all"" and its only real weaknesses are bugs (for which it is tolerable, much better than NWN 2) and inefficient UI. This and its sequel have an unparalleled amount of content, this has more role-playing than every other BioWare game and BioWare's best writing is to be found in expansions for this game like Hordes of the Underdark. Enhanced Edition has nice fixes and improvements including multiplatform support and 64-bit, as well as new expansions, but it introduces some bugs as well.

So, regarding Enhanced Edition. No UI changes. Simplified sound options, but with my Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium HD this game sounds like it's using EAX 3 like the original. It has retained mod compatibility with mods for the original games, but many of the old mod tools do not work for this one.

For those unfamiliar with Neverwinter Nights, this game and its sequel are the ultimate high fantasy RPGs, the ones that objectively went farther than any other to ""do it all."" They have the most character build diversity, most equipment, highest amount of creatures, and have the most thorough and faithful D&D rule implementation of any video game by far. 7 playable races, 11 base classes, 12 prestige classes, hundreds of feats, hundreds of spells, though less of all of these things than the sequel. About 40 different types of melee weapons alone with many individual weapons for each, with actual unique skins or even models. 

In these respects, the only RPGs not outright humiliated by Neverwinter Nights in this regard are its sequel, The Temple of Elemental Evil, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, and to a lesser extent Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. Every other high fantasy RPG is not even 1/4 of Neverwinter Nights from an objective point of view (amount of content).

This game also includes hundreds of hours of campaigns. You have the original campaign which is in the 40 hour range, Shadows of Undrentide expansion which combines with Hordes of the Underdark expansion to make an epic gargantuan level 1-40 campaign, and 7 premium modules and a few ""other modules."" Many of these expansions/modules offer unique narrative techniques and gameplay elements, and explore different parts of Faerun or different worlds entirely with different cultures and architectures/environments, far surpassing most RPGs in this regard as well. 

Some of these campaigns are also the absolute best things BioWare has ever written, surpassing KOTOR and Dragon Age: Origins and the garbage they put out today needless to say. This is BioWare's most ambitious and best executed RPG ever.

Then there's the multiplayer, which has a Dungeon Master client and unlimited ways to play it. Persistent worlds, co-op campaigns, PvP arenas, whatever you want. Neverwinter Nights is also one of the most moddable RPGs of all time, and I've had no issues using NWNCQ, PRC, CEP, and some other mods, as well as editing scripts from the original game and compiling them for Enhanced Edition for use with Enhanced Edition.

Role-playing potential is infinite with the ability to make your own adventures and play them in multiplayer with a Dungeon Master, and in single player with all the skills. The original campaign is unimpressive, but the expansions are the best campaigns BioWare has ever created. You can actually role-play in this game unlike in modern RPGs, this does not seem like a BioWare game at all if all you've played are Mass Effect and Dragon Age. You can be as evil and sadistic as you want, as passive as you want, and most of the campaigns (maybe even all, I forget) have full PvP enabled so you can attack anyone or target anyone. 

If you have Diamond Edition, then you don't really need this. If you don't have the original then I suppose you should go ahead and get this version.

Lastly, I highly recommend using PRC mod (NOT from Steam Workshop though) and checking out custom modules of course. My top module recommendations are Swordflight, The Aielund Saga despite its flaws, The Accursed Tower, Prophet series, Crimson Tides of Tethyr, Sands of Fate, A Dance with Rogues if you like kinky stuff, Lords of Darkness, Shadowlords+Dreamcatcher+Demon, and I recommend installing PRC into all of them except for Prophet series (which breaks).",1546966395,1616632814,True,31,1,0.709490120410919189,1,True,False,False

That said, I'm very nostalgic about it, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

TL;DR, this is a computer version of Dungeons and Dragons. If you're a fan of tabletop RPGs, you'll probably love this game. Skip the original campaign though, it's pretty terrible.

So what's good about this game? It oozes with character. The music (by Jeremy Soule) is unforgettable, and the artwork is gorgeous. It feels like somebody took an adventure path straight off the pages of Dungeon magazine and slapped it onto your computer screen. If you like, or are at least nostalgic for, classic DnD, then you will probably really like this game.

The original campaign, however, is awful. It's long (will take a good 20 hours to complete), but the story is pretty by-the-numbers and stereotypical, meaning you don't get invested enough in the game to enjoy those 20 hours. I won't spoil anything, but there are obvious plot twists. People with obvious bad-guy voices are obvious bad guys, even when they pretend to be good guys. There are no moral gray areas, just ""stab the evil guy with the meanie voice to save the world"". This can be charming in some games, but here for some reason it comes off as droll.

The game originally came with two expansions, each with their own campaign; ""Shadows of Undrentide"", and ""Hordes of the Underdark"".

Shadows of Undrentide is simply phenomenal. The story, unlike in the original campaign, constantly keeps you interested. You're faced with moral gray areas, such as having to help one overpowered villain out in order to defeat another. Everything has depth to it, rather than being a factory-made, by-the-numbers ""DnD story"". The music and artwork, which were already good in the original campaign, only serve to make the environment even more life-like. The game will take you on a journey, and by the end of it you'll feel a little different than you did before.

Hordes of the Underdark is also incredible, but in a different way. The game takes you beyond level 20, to 30 and even beyond. For those of you who saw that section in the Dungeon Master's Guide about levels beyond 20th and were fascinated, this campaign is for you. However, unlike in many epic-level campaigns, the challenge and scope of your adventure scales along with you. I won't give spoilers, but you end up doing the kinds of things a practical demi-god would do, all while still feeling a sense of challenge. And did I mention each campaign has it's own music? Again, wonderfully written by Jeremy Soule. The story, as with Shadows of Undrentide, really hooks you in, but this time it seems to revel in it's campyness, with cartoonish villains in wildly dramatic situations (the Valsharess literally looks like she just popped off the cover of a Dragon Magazine from the early 90s). The campyness, unlike in the original campaign, gives it charm. It's just plain fun.

But there are bad things about this game, and you should know about them.

Firstly, the class system is rather unbalanced. Clerics are completely overpowered, as a single feat gives you access to heavy armor, and buff spells let you punch far above your weight. Monks at higher levels are immune to practically anything and can kick any monster unlucky enough to be in just the wrong dungeon room into a bloody pulp. Druids are basically as OP as clerics, as they also get an animal companion and, unlike in the actual tabletop RPG, can wear heavy armor with only a single feat. Sorcerers and wizards, on the other hand, are rather under-powered. This is because, unless you're doing multiplayer, you don't have any companions besides the 1 (2 in Hordes of the Underdark) henchmen the game gives you. This means once you cast your 2 magic missile spells, you are basically useless in combat. That, and your hit die is d4. For those of you who don't know, this means you have so few hit points that somebody could breath on you wrong and you die, even at level 15. Overall, there is no real reason to play a classic fighter or rogue except for roleplay purposes. Some classes (especially cleric) are so overpowered it's a handicap not to play as one.

As I said, the henchmen AI is pretty bad. Sometimes they get stuck on a rock, and by the time you notice you're knee-deep in brown bears. It's easily fixed by going back to the location and spamming V-E-E (the command hotkeys for 'come here'), but it's still irritating to backtrack all the way across the map. There is a command system which is easily learned, and even comes with colorful and entertaining voice acting, but you will often only find yourself using V-E-E (come here) and V-W-E (attack). Especially the former, because the AI constantly seems to break. The game came from the late 90s, so some forgiveness is in order, but it will hurt your gameplay experience.

Just like with classes, some henchmen are clearly superior to others. Daelan Red-Tiger (the half-orc barbarian) is honestly the best fighter henchman in the original campaign. Tommy Undergallows is not only an awesome rogue, he is one of the most colorful characters in the entire game, and has since become an icon of Neverwinter Nights, second only to Deekin (sweet, lovable Deekin). But beyond this, he also unlocks chests and disables traps for you, which saves you a lot of time and headache.

I'm going to digress for a moment here. The traditional DnD party consists of 4 people. As someone who has played many games with far fewer, I can tell you that having less means less classes to cover all your bases. Doing without a rogue, or a cleric, or God-forbid a fighter will really hurt your party.

The problem is, you only get 1 companion, 2 in Hordes of the Underdark. That means you end up thinking ""man, I wish I had Tommy Undergallows instead of this meaty half-orc"" or ""God, if only this little halfling could swing a double-axe"" a lot. They tried to patch this up by having the henchmen multiclass in Shadows of Undrentide and giving you a whole extra companion in Hordes of the Underdark, but even then you'll still be inconvenienced at times.

Oh, did I mention there are other campaigns besides the two expansions? The vanilla game comes with even more premium modules, and there are others you can buy as DLC. I haven't played much of Darkness over Daggerford, but the little I have played was an amazing experience that was well-worth my money. That, and they often give you even more companions in these premium modules, so that's less of an issue there.

I think the final problem to mention is the actual gameplay itself. The combat system consists of ""click on this person and watch as you swing your weapon at them every 2-5 seconds while invisible dice rolls happen"". In the real tabletop game, at least you have the suspense and excitement of a die roll. Here, you get nothing but walls of text in the bottom of the screen should you choose to read them (and they go by so quickly you often can't even do that). If you're like me, and you love designing characters' stats and seeing them play out in a combat, then this will not be a problem for you. That said, the lack of visual feedback other than some somewhat entertaining and satisfying animations for 1998 playing out may be an issue for you.

I'll wrap up by summarizing what this game gets very right; atmosphere. It does an amazing job of transporting you into a fantasy world, with phenominal voice acting, unforgettable music, and stunning artwork. The stories are also gripping (if you forget about the original campaign), and help to suck you right into the world of Forgotten Realms. If you're a fan of tabletop RPGs, I strongly recommend this game.

But if you aren't, I don't think you'll like it. I ran out of characters, damn.",1615755886,1615755886,True,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

I bought this copy as a backup to my original Platinum-DVD collection (I have over 2500 hours on the non-steam version).  Great RPG that is made all the better by a monstrously open and adaptable development platform.  Sure, the story leaves something to be desired and really pales in comparison to Baldur's Gate 2, but with all the mods, DLC and self-created content, you certainly make up for quality with a mind-boggling amount of ""pretty good quantity"".  The game runs on toasters now and has co-op/singleplayer elements but can also be played in PvP.  There are a myriad of MMO and PvP servers online to choose from.  This makes NWN a never-ending pandora's box of DnD entertainment.  With the exception of really dated graphics and a buggy execution by Beamdog, this game is a gem.  

I have 6,000 hours in L4D 2 but in between the better part of a hundred completed campaigns, thousands of hours in MMO/PVP servers and utold *days* modding the platform, I can honestly affirm that NWN still holds the title for my most played gaming title, likely exceeding 7,000.  This game has ""mega-value"" written all over it.  A flawed reproduction of a masterpiece.  Recommended.

Neverwinter Nights has a large focus on the single player character instead of the more common team/party based play in tabletop inspired CRPGs. While you can take a henchman(or two depending on which campaign you're playing) you cant directly control them and have no(or little in the expansion campaigns) control over how they level up. 

So if you're looking for a story light, dungeon crawl heavy, RPG with a focus on controlling just the protagonist and don't mind the graphical and UI jank that comes from playing an almost 20 year old game Neverwinter Nights might just be for you!

-REVIEW-
So at this point in my life, I'm basically reliving all of these CRPGs that I played so many years ago, way back when they were older and less mod-able. I remember these games being rather difficult to understand, and yet I still checked them out anyway, simply because of the big, bright, beautiful worlds they offered. The Baldur's Gate saga and Icewind Dale were harder games back then, and yet I still beat them and had fun doing it. With the enhanced editions, my older self saw games that were outdated despite their enhancements and had a better understanding of their flaws, yet I still had a blast with them and could easily see why.

Now we move on to Neverwinter Nights, a game with a campaign and two expansions molded into one with an enhanced edition of its own. Like the other games, I played these quite a bit and enjoyed them in my younger years. I actually got into tabletop real quickly with these, as the latest edition in my college days was 3.5, just a quick jump from 3.0. It was quite a different game, but it was fun back then, at least before I got so blasted analytical.

Now? Yeah, not so much. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret my purchase of this game(overall) and I'm stoked to see devs and community members still showing love with persistent world multiplayer servers and even new single player modules(Dark Dreams of Furiae and Tyrants of the Moonsea being the newest), but holy cow, have I been disillusioned: I actually made an effort to do every sidequest possible and get to know my companions better, and even then the only thing I find about this game superior to the IE bunch is the ruleset, and even then Icewind Dale 2 did that better.

How times have changed, eh?

Now to be fair, there are gameplay elements I do like, such as being able to customize your toolbar at the bottom of the screen with whatever actions you want: weapons, spells, skills, etc. I like being able to examine characters for interesting background tidbits. I like being able to select feats, improve skills and use them in numerous situations, and even bolster my attributes! I just like how easier to digest 3.0 is(no bass-ackwards THAC0, for example). Being able to do all this extra stuff just adds more fun to the game, and accessing it isn't too difficult(radial menus FTW) even if the extra setup needed does add some tedium(gotta set all those spells and items in the toolbar, yippee). Plus, the combat isn't half bad at all(the traps are a pain, though). The difficulty scales nicely in every game, and there is some decent amount of strategy to it. Admittedly, the classes aren't too well balanced in this game(play as a sorcerer in OC, seriously, watch how high your CHA can go), but the gaps aren't quite as bad as in the 2nd edition titles.

So there is a lot to like about this game. What do I NOT like?

First, I hate the OC. Everything about it. The story is so haphazardly slapped together it just doesn't feel like fun at all. I mean, it has an interesting premise for sure, and you can do some fun things like slay dragons, but geez the plot is just terrible. It's like they took three story ideas that, separated enough, could be their own fun campaigns, but just smushed everything together, making the game feel that much more like a lazy, RNG laden version of Diablo 2. It's sad because some of the sidequests have interesting ideas, but the farther you go on, the more padded out everything is. Even the characters aren't interesting! Every important person in the plot is so thoroughly one-note, I barely evoke any emotion from them at all.

Speaking of characters...the companions. Freaking yawn. I'll admit, I did enjoy learning about their backstories as I leveled(some more than others), but these diversions are all the same: walls of text you just read through, without really being able to do any quests with them. Hell, the only ""quests"" are scavenger hunts for some item they really need in exchange for some nice equipment. The achievements say it all: you're not really making any friendships with them, only buying them.

Speaking of companions...WHY THE DUCK AM I STUCK WITH ONE HENCHMAN AT A TIME?! And why...WHY do I have to either talk with them or clamor through some menu to get them to DO things? I mean, remember the Infinity games, where you had, I don't know, A WHOLE PARTY? And you could FULLY CONTROL everyone? Is it any wonder why games like Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, and Pathfinder: Kingmaker are built the way they are? It's D&D 101, folks!

All these issues are especially frustrating with the OC since the expansions, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark, do EVERYTHING so much better. Both games have better crafted plots, more interesting characters and companions, tighter writing and backstories...not to mention they're more challenging gameplay-wise. Sure, there are still party limitations, but it baffles me to this day why the OC, the LONGEST story, couldn't get any of this nice stuff. Of course, even the expansions aren't perfect, with Underdark having a few aggravating AI bugs with a couple companions, mainly due to horse features being added with recent modules.

So one has to wonder: why was the game built this way? I got my answer pretty quick in my college days: multiplayer. I didn't do it a whole lot, but I found multiplayer to be pretty darn fun, and I still do here and there, even though the gameplay limits irk me. Way back when, there was a site where players could schedule in-game D&D sessions, like a tabletop but with the game, which was such an amazing idea. That site no longer exists, but there are tons of persistent worlds that get lots of traffic, and I am amazed at how the worldbuilders adjust the game's rules to make things more fun and worthwhile to earn.

Building worlds so easily is no doubt due to graphics that are easy to work with, which is good, because in terms of actual looks, this game has aged like milk. Sure, there are some nice bits of eye candy, like snazzy armor pieces and magical effects, but even then this game looks terrible. Character models that just OOZE polygons, simplistic terrains and indoor elements that just get recycled in single player over and over again...like I said, the expansions do it better, but even then, most of the game is quite the eyesore.

In terms of sound, well, the game is okay. Voice acting is a bit of a divide for me; the main plot npcs across all three games all do a really nice job overall; some performances are hammed up a bit too much, but I can live with them. Your character also gets to choose from their own soundsets, which are just...laughable. Not BAD, but definitely not all that great, like they tried way too hard to nail the cliche sound on a lot of them. The music is also okay at best. There's a lot of tunes to be heard epic and ambient alike, but they just don't have that beauty and power that other CRPGs, hell, other GAMES carry.

Like I said, I had fun revisiting these games, and I do believe anyone really interested in 3.0 D&D will have a fun time. Just be prepared with a bucket of salt in hand, because this game just hasn't aged as well as any of the other old CRPGs out there, and unlike the IE titles, the ""enhanced"" edition didn't enhance squat; even the AI pathfinding still sucks. It's not a terrible title, but playing this game with an older perspective has truly brought out the winter of my discontent.

A lot of people I've spoken with about the game enjoy the main story that comes with NWNs, I personally feel that main story sucks. However, the toolset is amazing! It's very simple to use, it's well done for live-DMing (which is what interested me in the first place) and the community has created a ton of content, much of which is amazing and well worth the money of buying this game and the time to play it.

The best feature in this game, IMO, is the DM-ing tool, and Multiplayer server-ability. Game servers can host hundreds of players, and people and communities have setup gaming servers that stay up nearly 24/7, just like MMOs. They call them Persistent World Servers, and they're the main thing I love about this game and recommend it for.

The community that plays in Persistent World Servers are the best I've seen for online roleplaying, and are generally very polite.

This game ticked off a lot of MMO companies, because it basically allows anyone to create their own MMO with ease.

If you like roleplaying, especially tabletop roleplaying, and you want a CRPG to fill that role for you, I highly recommend this game for you.

THE GOOD
Great Toolset
Great Community!

THE BAD
For some, they might feel it's a bit pricey, and you may want to get it on sale.
It's real-time, not pause & play nor turn-based.
 - The one thing I wish they'd have done differently.

THE UGLY
Some might feel the graphics are ugly.
The main adventure that comes with the game makes no sense to me, and while others have expressed enjoying it, I feel it's ugly.

If you're not a roleplayer looking to play it multiplayer with other roleplayers on persistent world servers, you might want to pass on this one and get a newer CRPG.

But, I know of no other CRPG that allows you to host hundreds of players at once, like this one does. I think most only allow up to four players at a time..?",1610140388,1610140388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, its a classic for a reason. CRPG at its finest. 
Being a D&D player IRL, i recognize a lot of aspects from the rulebooks in the game. Which isnt surprising, since this game is pretty much D&D imported straigth to computer.
The story is great so far (just made it to chapter 2), though the writing shows its age (not that im complaining, its a breath of fresh air from modern RPG’s more complex storywriting). The graphics are what you’d expect from an older game, though you can beautify it through the steam workshop. Audio is great! Music is great! 
Gameplay is smooth and it flows well. Going through a lord's estate, defeating his guards and looting his valuables isnt a chore. The combat is fun and intuitive, you dont have to do more than click the enemy and watch the battle. You can, however. I havent looked into it, but you can make the battles as advanced as you want. Personally, i prefer my characters use their abilities as they see fit.
Companions/henchmen are.. well, they're mediocre without mods. I thought having a cleric henchman would be a big plus, and though she's helped me a lot, she dosnt do much more than any other companions. I've yet to have a burglar, but im guessing they'd be much more usefull since they can open locked doors and containers. Apparently spellcasters are a big waste since their spellcasting AI is dumb and they're super squishy.

The steam stuff means you can easily mod your game or play coop with friends. Achievements are nice too.

I tried playing the second game a long time ago, never got into it. This one is much better in my opinion!

It actually happened to be the first “realtime with pause” cRPG that I got to play on my own PC, with me getting the other classics a few months afterwards, after I dropped the first attempted playthrough because I got bored. It was only after thoroughly enjoying the Baldur’s Gate games that I’ve decided to give NWN a chance and in the end did get some enjoyment out of it. The two expansions that followed, Shadows of Undrentide and especially Hordes of the Underdark, were far more enjoyable, yet I couldn’t help but feel that NWN core mechanics and controls were simply less interesting then what BioWare did with Infinity Engine and would do with KOTOR and later titles. So, the last time I’ve actually properly tried replaying NWN was in 2006, if my save files are to be believed. And even then, I didn’t get to the end, getting bored again.

This replay, using the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition in its latest (as of my writing this, the game is constantly updated) version, fared a bit better. Though, my opinion on the original game hasn’t changed much.

While a lot of the concepts in NWN are similar to what BioWare did in previous and later RPG titles with realtime with pause combat, what was always extremely different is the fact that (at least in singleplayer campaigns) your player character was almost completely alone. It wasn’t about gathering a party to venture forth – you could have one “henchman” per player (and per team, if you were playing coop, at least in some patches) but otherwise it was a solo or coop affair. To the point, where it’s very hard to avoid seeing NWN as a “slow Diablo with D&D rules”, rather than a follow up to Baldur’s Gate as some people expected. Now, this always depends on what campaign you’re playing and one of the biggest selling points of NWN was it’s ability to host more or less proper D&D sessions with a DM and a party, but as a single-player game with its official story, it was pretty much just that – a tedious and boring action RPG.

That original campaign is as agonizing to go through as it used to be in 2002. I’ve never tried Anthem, but apart from that, this remains the least interesting thing BioWare has ever produced. Yet, in many ways, it started a “formula” of sorts that would be reused time and time again in future BioWare productions. There’s an ancient civilization that threatens the world, there’s a betrayer who might have a relatable backstory and get a chance of redemption at the end, and each story bit/chapter has a hub and multiple options in terms of in what order you can explore things. In fact, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, a title that was in development at the same time and released just a year later, would reuse the main plot almost verbatim, but in a far more interesting way.

Though, it’s not just the plot that get frustrating. By Act 3 (of 4) the game seemingly extends itself just for the sake of it. Already too long and full of optional dungeons and quests that aren’t really that interesting or deep, it adds 10 more hours of uninteresting stuff, made more frustrating due to how incompetent your partners are. With pathfinding being as bad as it is, it’s not helping that your partner might forget what they were doing. Especially if you can’t lockpick and disarm traps yourself and run around with Tomi, since by the end the game locks and traps every single chest you find just for the sake of it – most of them contain nothing of value. Not that there aren’t cool quests or moments in the original campaign, but ultimately it’s simply not worth the time.

Shadows of Undrentide is a welcome change of tone and pace. It starts on a much smaller scale and with a new character (story-wise, you can import your existing one, but I would advise against it). Instead of going for some crazy epic stuff from the beginning, it starts slow, fighting kobolds and gnolls, trying to outsmart some tougher enemies instead of doing everything with brute force, adding moments where your alignment is influenced by your choices, even smaller ones, and making every location actually unique in some way. And the story and characters, while not fantastic, are intriguing and different enough to get you hooked. It eventually works its way into becoming an epic adventure by the end, which ends up feeling deserved.

It does have annoying moments and the final third of the expansion is considerably weaker and more annoying then what comes before, but it’s a really fun campaign which tries to be inventive, even if sometimes it’s to the detriment.

For the longest time I’ve considered Hordes of the Underdark, the second expansion, to be the main reason to even bother with the original NWN. And while now, after replaying it, I must say that my memories of it were more positive than the actual experience of playing it is, it’s still the most interesting piece of content released for the game. A direct sequel to the previous expansion, it starts at a relatively high level and by the end gets into ridiculously epic levels, while somehow managing to stay interesting and not devolve into mindless action and grinding.

Big part of that lies in just how different each of its 3 chapters are. It starts as a high level dungeon crawling adventure, not unlike something from Icewind Dale. Then transitions into something almost straight from Baldur’s Gate II. And ends the story with heavy Planescape: Torment flavor. It is a bit too ego-boosting, with everyone constantly talking about how cool your character is. And it does try to fit a really huge epic story with big character development arcs into a relatively short campaign, ending up awkward at times. Still, it is genuinely engaging and fun and a far cry from the terrible boredom of the original campaign.

That said, there are some serious issues with the expansion that become more evident the closer to the end it is. Second chapter has a serious bug that can render all magic items unusable forever in one optional area, something that might be exclusive to just this re-release. And the last chapter is just too full of concepts and mechanics that the poor engine simply couldn’t handle, so you’re always running the risk of getting locked out of completing the game, because of some action you did or some important character getting stuck inside a wall. All that said, if there’s one reason to play NWN, it’s this expansion.

And if you do decide to replay the game, Enhanced Edition is a great way to do it. When it was originally launched, there was hardly a good reason to get it, as the Diamond Edition, already available at GOG at the time, wasn’t that much worse and tended to be less buggy. But after several years of updates, the Enhanced Edition started to look and feel superior to what the game originally was and in addition added lots of the “premium modules” (paid story campaigns that were DLCs before the concept of DLCs) that almost got lost to time. While I’ve not played those yet (I might revisit the game just for those at some point), some of them get more praise than any of the main expansions. Plus, if you are interested in the multiplayer aspect of the game, it’s far easier to do it in this edition than with the old one.

Should you play Neverwinter Nights? If you’re really into D&D RPGs (and 3rd edition) with realtime with pause combat and either more interested in the multiplayer aspect of the title or willing to ignore the dreadfully boring main campaign and enjoy the expansions and premium modules, this could be a good time. It can be… trying at times, if you play singleplayer, and the campaigns are pretty long, especially if you do the side quests. And I would recommend Baldur’s Gate, Jade Empire, KOTOR or Dragon Age over this any day. But there might be something for you to enjoy in this one.",1609520060,1609520060,True,2,0,0.512245118618011475,0,True,False,False

After all these years I said I have to play and finish it, especially when I saw there's this EE available.
Everything felt very familiar, the story elements came back and I quickly surpassed the point I've reached before and moved on from Chapter 1 of the original game. I found out that the game is really dull, you just have to talk to all the characters with a name and they'll point you in the direction of a quest, you go there, finish it and get your reward. Very linear, very dull. On top of this the game has many glitches, like a character being stuck in the middle of environment, or the henchmen just acting bad (they die really often anyway). After level 7 I was pretty much unbeatable and I played a Fighter and picked up a few Rogue levels just to make my life easier with locks and traps. So as I said, unbeatable just point and click and pretty much kill everything.
The game with so much potential yet it is extremely not challenging, and quite frankly boring. No wonder I never finished it before.

So... Long story short, I reached the end of a very boring storyline that was predictable anyways, and after finishing the game they didn't even bother with a decent Epilogue. :( So whatever happened with Aribeth, Nasher, and the others? Why did no one congratulate me and praise me for saving them all??

OK, so I decide to move on and start the first expansion Shadows of Undrentide. Well after being disappointed with the original this was even worse. The curse of the old RPGs. :( They always make a lousy expansion. :( The maps are empty, vast landscapes with very few NPCs, very boring quests, and pretty much nothing else. Right from the start I hoped to finish this one as quickly as possible. And to make things worse, you know I figured I should pick up my old character who was 17th level Fighter/Rogue/Champion of Torm. But this is a low level scenario! WHAT! Why did you let me play this character then? This was beyond boring, I would kill everything in just one or two strikes at most. What a disappointment but I really did not want to start a new character, especially when I saw just how boring this is.

Once SoU was done I had to wrap up the game and play Hordes of the Underdark. Though a little bit better, this expansion also suffers from the lack of quality content. There are some interesting characters, but the overall plot and story is not very imaginative. Here you actually meet the companions from the original and can have them accompany you for some time. It was a little bit better than SoU but still I just rushed through it as it did not capture my attention.

Bottom line, this game did not age well. It might have been something back in the day because it kinda changed RPG games a little bit and introduced something that will influence the future of the genre, but today it does not hold up and may be skipped by all means. I would not say that this game is a classic and must be played, which is not the case with its predecessors that are an absolute must for every RPG fan out there.",1609287607,1609287607,False,10,1,0.536464154720306396,0,True,False,False

The Game is an old one so do not expect state of the art graphics from this one and the original single player campaign is not the best, it is too long and can get repetitive, though the story of Aribeth was a good starting place they bloated the adventure out with similar quests that just have different enemies.

The Shadows over Undretide and Hoards of the Underdark campaigns are superior though and there are a myriad Premium Modules and Community Content Modules available for this game that again are far superior to the Original Campaign.

The other huge plus for this game and the reason why I would personally recommend it are for the persistent worlds that are available. Especially for any who are familiar with the Table Top variants of the D&D game (I am old school First Edition AD&D player and I enjoy this take on the 3.5 edition Rules of D&D).

Some of these persistent worlds have dedicated DM's and are lovingly created using material from D&D Table Top sources like the Forgotten Realms, which the three single player campaigns are set in and others have used older sources such as Gygax's The World of Greyhawk setting and yet others use J.R.R. Tolkiens Middle Earth.

Created my own server called The Crimson River or TCR for short, had 20+ players round the clock back in the day, was a lot of fun. 

After updating my old server module to EE I re-hosting my old server but it sits there empty around the clock, there just doesn't seem to be as many players online anymore which is sad because hosting your own server now feels kinda pointless. Because most players will stick to one server. so can't really get a player base. 

Beamdog should really try getting more people to join the community maybe have a sale to try and get more people to buy the game. 

I 100% recommend the base game. Multiplayer is where the true aspect of this game shines best.

If you're a fan of Forgotten Realms, D&D or RPGs - this is a must-have for your library.

In short, you get it for the multiplayer. Think of a game known for its modding and custom content, like Warcraft 3 or Skyrim, and you'll have a pretty good idea of why people have continued playing this game and its older incarnations for two decades. I've easily spent 4000 hours in Diamond Edition before getting this on Steam.

You could join a server like Arelith, Ravenloft or Anemoi and play it like an MMO. Or you could play through an adventure in co-op. Or you can hop on the DM client, and run a campaign for your friends. You could just want to play on your own too. I've spent a solid 500 hours in a tabletop style campaign with friends, custom built and DMed by a friend from Neverwinter Connections, and there are a few people in it that own this game just to play in it.

This is a game where you'll get your money's worth, many times over. No DLC needed at all for enjoying the full multiplayer experience, definitely pick it up if it's on sale.

As for how Beamdog has handled NWN EE, I'd give them two thumbs up. It was a bumpy start, with EE being less stable than the old Diamond Edition - but that has long since been resolved. Not only did Enhanced Edition restore the server list, they've also added other features like auto-downloading custom content when you join a server. The updates to the game are gradual but show a great deal of consideration to the needs of the community.

10/10 updated game, well done to the Beamdog devs.",1537464007,1607607356,True,3,0,0.566929101943969727,2,True,False,False

It is, of course, perfectly playable. However, the EE doesn't change the core of the game, so there's plenty of age left apparent in its design.

Strange and sudden difficulty spikes plague the entire experience. The rhythm of combat seems geared towards mimicking the Saturday morning cartoon tendency to throw a hundred faceless mooks and one story-relevant challenger at the hero. This means most fights end in only a couple of attacks with minimal damage, eliminating any reason to prepare for them, and others end just as quickly in the enemy's favor without so much as a dramatic entrance as warning. These out-of-nowhere challenges do nothing to teach the ins and outs of the combat system, they only teach a respect for the auto-save key.

That said, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the story of the original Neverwinter Nights campaign. Sure, every story beat was foreshadowed just shy of stating it outright and the player's contribution largely amounts to a streak of impossible luck that is only ever commented on as some epic personal feat. And, because of that 'find a needle in a world of haystacks' nature of the main quest, it's hard to know what needs to be kept and what should be discarded. But the characters, their struggles, and the unfolding mystery of the enemy you face are compelling enough outside of the player's sometimes absurd involvement. 

Henchmen, the characters you'll spend the most time with, add as much value as they do highlight how roughly the game is put together. Keeping them alive was always a struggle due to an unrealistic and uncooperative AI. The game doled out no punishment for them meeting their untimely end, but the dialogue I got after my first companion resurrection was dark enough to make it my last. Likewise, the personal journeys of the various henchmen during our quest kept me hooked and hoping to learn more about the characters despite each of them erroneously talking like they'd been traveling with me the whole time. Since you're only allowed one henchmen at a time, it'd be impossible for all of them to be right and you're left with the choice to ignore this inconsistency or ignore all but one character during a playthrough.

A pair of connected expansion stories follow up the original campaign to save Neverwinter and these adventures represent another give and take in the henchmen interactablity department. The personal quests are gone in this installment, but now your companions stop you to comment on plot points and even banter with each other. The larger story of this adventure is now more about improbably surviving due to being some kind of chosen one than MacGiffin hunting, but that makes about as much sense as finding multiple 'hidden for thousands of years relics' in retrospect. Hordes of the Underdark, the second of the two modules, actually brings back most of the original campaign's characters and despite playing a different character this time around, (they'll tell you about the Hero of Neverwinter even if you if you imported your previous character) it feels like a fitting epilogue to that story.

As I've noticed in writing this review, story is what matters most in Neverwinter Nights, at least to me. Whether it's the one the game tries to tell you or the one you end up creating yourself, all those quirks of the gameplay disappear into the background in the midst of it. I won't remember how much of the long dungeon crawls were mindless and how much had me pulling out my hair. But I will remember desperately fighting to keep Linu La'neral alive while we helped the people that needed it and my overconfident, misbehaving badger friend, Basil.",1607475329,1607475329,True,25,0,0.717150211334228516,0,True,False,False

I still have the original game Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2 CD collection from back when they came out.
Its got ok main campain story, good DLC stories, official game mods and player made mods to play.
So what about about Neverwinter Nights:Enhanced Edition?
Its great but I wouldn't call it exactly Enhanced Edition.

What Neverwinter Nights:Enhanced Edition brings is exactly the same exp as the original game with all the patches and updates that makes it run on modern PC.
This time around graphics are sharper and cleaner. You can scale resolution to what you want but that is it. All the other things are the same as before.

So lower your expectation on the word ""enhanced"" and you will be fine.

I to would like to see this game to be remaked with more modern graphics but this is still better than nothing. :)

Now for those who are asking them self if they should get Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition or Neverwinter Nights 2 let me give you my personal opinion.
For me when it comes to gameplay (builds, combat, mods) first game wins.
When it comes to better graphics second game wins.

You can still do this easily.  While mostly the steam workshop subscribe system works. I have found some that are not listed or may error.  And this can be frustrating for a lot of people and turn them off.  I have included my version of [b] Instructions [/b] below which may help.

Also I highly recommend ""The Aielund Saga Act 1-IV"" it is really something very special and an exceptional playthrough.

[h1] instructions for mod installation [/h1]

[olist]
[*] Go to [url=neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-i-nature-abhors-vacuum] NWN vault  and you can search for anything you want.


[*] Click on the ""Module"" you might like and download the files under “attachment” heading towards the bottom of the page 

[*] [b] Important [/b] - look at the ""required projects"" list directly below the ""attachments"".  These are additional flies you need to have the overall module work.  These will need to be installed also.

Tip - I do each in order and one at a time. Go slow and make sure you don't miss any.

[*] [b] Important [/b] -  When clicking to the other “required projects” make sure you scroll down and look again for any additional ""required projects"" that may be needed.  This has caught me out. 

[*] Now for the installing part.   I first unzip (one at a time) each project to a folder on the desktop. I do this a sometimes unzipping directly to your directly creats a sub-fold that can mess with the operation.   Open the folder and have a look at the various file endings.  For example: .mod, .erf, .mov etc. Do some sorting if you wish to group together. 

[*] In a new a explorer window navigate to your NWN folder on your at Steam\steamapps\common\Neverwinter Nights OR you can right click on your game in steam and select manage/browse local files that will open an explorer window.

[*] Select the “data” folder.  When you open this you will see the various folders labeled same or similar as the downloaded file endings.  E.g. .mod, .erf, .mov etc

[*] Copy the specific files over from your desktop to the corresponding folder.  Place the  .mod file in the .mod folder etc.  You do not need to do this in any specific order and if you have sorted them you can just do a bulk copy.  

[*]  If you having trouble and have file ending that does not match with any folder name.  Use the search bar in the “data” window and type in the ending.  E.g. type .hak  It will find some results.  Then just right click any matching file found, and select “open file location”. You will find “.hak”goes in the “hk”folder.  There are instructions on the forum of the NVN vault but if you use this process you can do it for anything.

[*] Once you have copied over all the various files into the right location start the game, select “new” then “other modules” and select the name of the module you wish to play e.g. “The Aielund Saga Act 1”

[*]  [b] Important [/b] - If for whatever reason you cannot find the module, you may not have the .mod file in the .mod folder or it's been unzipped into a sub-folder in that location.  If you find the module but you get an error when you start it means you have missed a ""required project""file (or copied one to the wrong location)

[*]  [b] Important [/b]– to determine which file you are missing, when you first installed NWN windows (or steam) creates a “Neverwinter Nights” folder in your “My Documents” folder on your C: drive. Navigate to this and select the “logs” folder

[*] Within the logs folder there will be a .txt log file.  Open this, scroll right down to the bottom and it will tell you the name of the file which is missing (e.g. couldn’t load ""xyz"").  You can then go back to your downloads or the NVN vault and find it and install as per the process above.

This is my first ever review so bear with me.

This game is a great RPG with rich story telling and amazing gameplay.
It was a little bit of figuring out how everything worked but i have played Baldur's Gate 1 and the DLC Siege of Dragonspear so it was not too hard to get in.
Some interface things a clungy but it does not bother me at all. (i actually kind of like it)

If you dont mind graphics from 2002, love RPG and prefer good gameplay, this game is for you.
(This game is still being updated after 18 years and has a very active community)

There are multiple modules that are very praised (some not so)
The multiplayer is still active but i have never try'd it yet.
Currently i have been playing for 54 hours and im still in Chapter 2 of the main game and there are 7 more premium modules available.

The modding community is also very active and they even create their own modules you can play.

Overall if you want content within a game, you like D&D and RPG's

There are cons:
- Graphics (for the newskool people born after the year 2000)
- Some cluncy mechanics 
- Not high speed action gameplay

8/10 and i hope they will ever make a next gen game like this :) (or something new like this)",1605043108,1605043108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've also used material for classes and the XP chart in real games, as well as looked at how some spells and abilities would look like for when running game sessions.

I was ecstatic to have seen it become available through steam, because I couldn't find my old disks and might even have a hard time getting my CD Keys to work through BioWare due to I'm not sure if it was linked to an old e-mail or my current one.

Yes, the graphics are a little dated, but it doesn't diminish the replay factor, since you have 40 levels to play with, and many classes and many combinations to make and try out. Yes, the story is still the same on any play through, but at least there are a bunch of modules and tools to allow you to make your own as well.

So, in the end, if you like D&D and/or RPGs, then this is a good value for you. It has tons of hours of play, many character types and thus change of play styles, whether you are a Shifter not staying in your form, but using different races or even creature types to fight as, or a mighty wizard flinging spells about (needing places to rest to restore your spells, or are you a Paladin in heavy armor smiting evil... It is left up to you to try... and that's where the fun really is.

Hint: IF you don't like using console commands to ""cheat"", start up a new character in Hordes of Undrintide, get a level 15 character, get the items from the inn (some light magical weapons and/or armor +1 to +3 range), and then save character, load up in the base game.

I got it as a freebee when I bought another game here on Steam, but I owned and played it back in the day when it first came out and was the cutting edge of CRPG.
I will say - I still enjoy it. But it demonstrates an interesting fact, namely that 3D games don't age as well as 2D games do. I mean, maybe the current generation of 3D games is still going to look nice 15 years from now, but if you compare the graphics of NN with an even older 2D game such as, say, Baldurs Gate today, BG comes out as a clear winner. Strange, given that in it's day, NN was amazing and nobody would have picked BG over it!
But aside from the dated graphics, it's still a very enjoyable game. The story still is interesting and captivating. Sadly, even though I hardly remember anything about it, I do remember a major plot point later in the story. Ack, brain, you really don't know what to remember and what to forget, do you?
I always found it a little sad that they limited your party to only one companion at a time, and managing the inventory can be a little tedious at times, but all in all gameplay still is interesting, and one can see just how much it influenced later Bioware games from Star Wars KOTOR to DragonAge.
Anyways, I don't think anyone is going to ditch their latest Witcher3 playthrough for this one, but if you have nothing better to do it's still worthwile and fun.

Let`s start with positives:

- Sweet quests: it`s a total pleasure to kill a bitchy farmer`s daughter and catch a change of alignment (absolutely worth it!). Or to burn bodies in chaos of plague and all of a sudden get an achievment. Or to pass a quest of being a judge for Lathander who placed a hella lot of slaads in a prison tower just to have fun I guess. All in all I had quite a lot of good memories after this, thank you very much.

- Nice PARRRRTNER (you can use only one, though). My favourite was a halfling named Tomi Undergallows, who died a thousand deaths - and yeah, every eefing time he dies you can just tp to the temple with your tp rock and take him away from there with full hp, like a damn kid taken from a kindergarten!

- BARD is definitely the best class! (you are useless unless you cast yourself a stinky wolf or foul bear; sometimes you can heal, but potions are always better! sometimes you can deal some damage, but rods are always better! sometimes and most of the times you just eefing sing). Also my chara`s name was Bobby Stinkballs, that made some dialogs sound more alive.

And now let`s talk about some disadvantages:

- This game is absolutely exhausting and long, even with some good moments it`s really hard to make yourself finish it. I`m not sure if the achievements were added later to the game (and many users just played the game but never had a chance to get them) or it`s really so bad, but only 2% of players have an honourable deed of killing Morag and accomplishing the final quest.

- Until you get some protection from fear, it`s the most powerful weapon in this game. You, your halfling, your wolf, your bear and your balls get a permanent state of fear until you just die (dragons are really scary!)

- Sometimes either your mates or your enemies can`t find their way in three blocks of surface and they just bag and stare at you standing motionless. It`s more or less okay, when an ancient red dragon behaves like this and gets killed, but when your stupid halfling fails you for the 100th time, it starts bothering you.

- Some mobs are stronger than a damn dragon, but they will give you only 17 xp, because F U, brave adventurer!

- You are always aware of some possibility of sex. Still even being a bard with 24 charisma doesn`t help you to get a fair woman. Once there`s a chance to make love with an old gnome and once you can hire a whore. But you are always in a kind of a sexual tention.

In conclusion, I must aware you, that after playing this game for all this time my boyfriend got some mental disease, and somewhy he isn`t even willing to play dlcs. the game is good, but absolutely worst of everything I could ever advise to anyone.

A lot of the earlier bugs seem to have been worked out with updates, and the very dated graphics have been improved a smidge. Be advised though, it's still a very dated game.

Thank you for the response, I know you folks at Beamdog mean well. I do appreciate the position of Beamdog with respect to development - I simply gave an honest review. 

My well wishes with Axis and Allies Online are sincere, I hope it does well for the company - I personally don't want a repeat of GPG - I hope you can appreciate my position.",1597944502,1602311029,False,2,0,0.493589729070663452,0,True,False,False

Originally developed by the once actually decent BioWare and published by Atari, Neverwinter Nights was a game with so much replayability that I have only stopped playing it for short intervals in 18 years. It's been installed on every PC I've ever owned, including my old family PC as a child. Over the years I watched it stagnate, fail to work on new hardware, or crash 24/7. A notebook laptop I had for university handled the game so badly that it crashed on startup. For the passed couple years I've used the GoG edition of the game exclusively for designing my own modules using the Toolset and rarely played the game at all unless it was to test those modules, as on my current setup the game just looked like a walking disaster - crashing all over the place, terrible resolution (my monitor is the 2560 x 1600 variety), I couldn't get the high resolution textures to load correctly, it was just a mess. 

Then Beamdog released this thing and all that feels like a bad dream now - well, mostly. The Enhanced Edition has several problems of its own and if it was up to me, this review would be neutral rather than positive or negative. 

Quite a few of the other reviews say that if you already own the GoG edition, you don't need to bother with this one. Honestly I think I'll be one of the few who will disagree. The modern resolution upgrade is more than enough to invest in this version if that kind of thing matters to you, although in some places the UI in-game can be a little small as Beamdog didn't do much to change that to make it fit modern resolutions. There's mods on the Workshop that help with this though, by increasing text size or making the windows transparent or different colours so the things on them are easier to see. 

There's a couple quality of life changes such as now being able to see through obstacles and buildings when looking at your character from a side angle, allowing you to still see what's happening even if a building is in the way. 

Also, if you have any characters you're fond of from previous editions of the game, you can keep their files, because they'll work on this edition if you stick them in the proper folder. Same thing for overrides, haks and modules - it's all backwards compatible.

The original campaign, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark are as delightful as they have always been, and it's been a joy to play through them again. They are also the most stable of the content within the game (you'll see what I mean).

Kingmaker, ShadowGuard and Witches' Wake are the three original Premium Modules that you could buy during the game's original release several thousand years ago and you can get them now too. Being Premium Modules, they've always been a little funky, but it feels more obvious now. I've had numerous bugs with each one, some of which stop progression. 

Infinite Dungeons, Pirates of the Sword Coast and Darkness over Daggerford I can't comment on yet as I haven't played them - will add them as I do.

Wyvern Crown of Cormyr was my favourite Premium Module as a kid, I remember wanting it so badly that I begged my dad to get me it. I remember it was one of the first online transactions that I ever took part in, lmao. It hasn't aged well unfortunately, and my game is currently hard crashing every time I try to enter Hawklin Castle, so I can't progress with the story. I have a ticket open with Beamdog as I type this, so here's hoping it's on my end and not the game's.

EDIT OCTOBER 2020: Since writing this review I managed to resolve my issue with Wyvern Crown myself. However, customer service at Beamdog handled my problems terribly. They simply told me ""It's fixed now"" and set my ticket to resolved when it was not in fact fixed, and it took me months to resolve the issue in my own time, my own way - something I REALLY could have used help with as I am not, in fact, a game dev. Whatever though. A couple points down from me and I hope I never have to interact with the company again.

Tyrants of the Moonsea seems to be their latest Premium Module. From what I understand, it was an original Premium module that was cancelled, and Beamdog took up the mantle of finishing it. I really enjoyed the pacing and story of this one, but am yet to finish it, as this module ALSO crashes periodically and one time I lost five hours of work because autosave just full on stopped working and I still haven't forgiven it enough to try it again. Also your party members are kind of shoehorned in, not really allowing you to develop a connection with them, which is a huge turnoff for me.

I don't do multiplayer, so I can't comment on that either, but from what I've read; sometimes it works beautifully and other times it's raining disconnects. 

~~ A couple pointers ~~

- If you're a DM who plans to use the Toolset and also has an nVidia graphics card, turn off Threaded Optimization in the GeForce Control Panel to avoid crashing upon loading an area. You don't seem to have to do this for the game itself, just the Toolset. 

- If the character customization options the game gives you are too limited for what you want, grab Customize Character Override HAK (CCOH) from the Workshop. Alternatively, the Leto program lets you edit your character’s file directly and change literally anything you want, from stats to model appearance to portraits to spells. (Don’t use these online at all unless you have permission from a server owner to do so. I literally just use them for RP purposes, as some of my characters are creatures that aren’t normally playable in the game.)

-Another DM one – if you plan to use the Toolset often, you’re going to get bored of vanilla assets fast. Download CEP (Community Expansion Pack) from the Workshop, it’s got SO much stuff in it to help make your building experience a little more fresh.

-Yet another builder one, sorry :P If you’re completely new to scripting with the Toolset, Lilac Soul’s Script Generator V2.3 is the perfect tool to help you out. I’ve been using it religiously for years as I was once a complete novice to code. It won’t do absolutely everything for you, but it can help you move a module along if you were stuck on something you couldn’t figure out how to script, and it’s good for learning the process as well. 

-Advanced Combat Animations Pack V4 – Override Edition is vital to my playthroughs now. Gives your characters a new lease of life by changing their fighting posture and attack animations.

I think that's basically it, sorry for the wall of text but this game is very close to my heart and I felt the need to do as much wordsmithing as I could manage. Whether you buy this edition or perhaps the GoG Diamond Edition, enjoy this game all the same - I wish all the time I could go back and experience it all for the first time.

I spent so many years playing this game and it feels as much alive today as it did back in the day. 

If your interested in game design, the toolset is imo, still THEE best toolset designed for a game. Its so, so easy to use and within a few minutes, you've finished designing your area, plus an hour or two and your finished. Being able to just drag your mouse and place entire floors, walls, ceilings or whatever, is such a powerful and splendid feeling as opposed to dragging in individual walls, floors and ceilings, rotating them and snapping them in exactly the right place. Scripting is now extremely easy with Lilac's scripting generator. Almost everything about the toolset is easy to use.

The graphics though dated, still are convincing and have a somewhat solid, hardcore feeling to them. The OC despite being quite a long haul, still invites me back for further plays, indeed do all of the modules and campaigns.

If a NWN2:EE came along, I'd get it, but only if the toolset was drastically changed towards a more NWN1 styled.

Much of this game is as I remember it from 2002.  I don't play it for the graphics or the fluid movement around objects; I play it for the nostalgia.

If your original play through of this game as a positive experience, I would suggest buying this Steam copy so that you might relive those days.  

I would caution you, as the potential buyer:
This game crashes often.  To combat the sudden game-ending crashes, quick save often.  I bound ""Quick Save"" to my ""Q"" button and I mashed that button frequently.  One final caution: avoid the lower pit under the beholder nest.  It bugged my character and wiped all magical items clean even after completing the area.

To read the NEW info, skip to >>> Present State <<<

Old D&D player from the 70's .... I have played every D&D game there is/was.

I was over the Moon excited in 2002, when NWN came out! To create your own D&D campaigns, dungeons, in 3D!!! Sold!

I have used the Aurora Toolset for years. 

As old as this game is, the community has remained strong and vibrant over these many years.

>>> Present State <<<

When Steam picked this up, I was very excited! I figured they would stream line the multiplayer > server process.... they did!

I figured they would add great updates and enhancements .... they did!

I had to tear my mega mod into it's micro components, and re-import all the bits, into the new toolset... but once I finished that, I have had no issues at all with creating things!

I am impressed with the possibilities of the in-game DM option! Something that the community has been calling for, for ever!

If you are a D&D player, serious D&D player, this is a MUST have!

If you are used to Diablo, or other hack & slash arcade games, this might not be your thing.

If you are a builder, creator or DM.... and you can handle a little scripting (There are tons of resources available BTW) then there is NOTHING out there that even comes close to this! 

Even though it shows only 180 hours for me, I am just getting started with the new NWN EE! 

I know I have easily put in thousands of hours with the Aurora Toolset over the years.

NOTE: as per mods go, this is the list of eleven I use and ORDER of install........

01) NWM Facelift, it's a compilation of all re-textures from the ground up except for toons and sky. 
02) Real Skies lite, cause its missing and this one looks gorgeous.
03) New Rain, because sure why not.
04) Customize Character Override, a MUST mode to customize EVERYTHING gear wise ect.
05) Advanced Combat Override, its just neat and combos Customize Character.
06) Gunner's Body Rebuild, it's not all that but better then the OG, IMO.
07) Issig_Kurairyu's-HANDS, no more block hands, actual fingers now YaY.
08) Ravenloft POTM Blood Overide, it changes blood splatter to sprayish instead of poodle.
09) Explosion VFX Override, more action packet looking, explosions/spells look more real.
10) Project Reforge, weapon enhancer, and boy are there many, but this one just hits the spot, the wepon style blends so great with the game, and it changes EVERY wepon in the game too, from your weapon to the henchmen weapons and even NPC's get this change so it makes it a natural feel as tho it was vanilla.
11) High Res Potions, OMG its like looking at gems and diamonds in your inventory, just look's amazing.

I have a lot of nostalgia for this game. I used to play when it quite a bit when it was already relatively old (2007) and I as first getting into DnD on the table. The graphics are not great, but the gameplay is solid if you have an understanding of 1e/2e rules for DnD. Without that the game can be kind of confusing since not a lot is explained well, but I think you can read through the manual if you look at the game files. The real value of this game is in the stories that you play through. Rather than have a marker on the map saying ""go here"" you have to read what NPCs are saying and look for other clues. It's usually pretty straightforward, but it's far more immersive to get instructions like that IMO.

Neverwinter Nights was one of my first game that defined my gaming experience in childhood. Back then I hardly understood the game's mechanics but was captivated by this world. And the world of NWN, in combination with the game's pacing, has a peculiar charm to it. This atmosphere can't be confused with any other. I find it grim and contemplative with a bit of dark fantasy lure.

[b]The very core[/b]

It's a story driven classic rpg. The biggest trick is to strategically customize your character according to what you want them to become. And to help with this and make the process more engaging, come wide customization options, including prestige classes. It's up to a player to choose whether to become top-notch in one profession or invest experience in other classes, which poses some risks but can lead to creation of extraordinary and potentially powerful combinations.

[b]Main activities[/b]

The gameplay is quite simplistic. You just click on the enemy and watch your character fight, occasionally using abilities and drinking potions. Then you explore the world and open containers, [i]a lot of[/i] containers, manage your equipment and inventory, talk to npc and watch your character fight again. 

[b]Old, but very much playable[/b]

The aged graphics, where npcs look like they are made of square elements, is compensated by visually engaging and immersive locations. Forgotten Realms Universe partially represented in the game feels alive and appealing, with lore and storytelling creating a believable world.

As for the game's strongest aspects, it's lots of variations in building up your character, decent story, featuring time-proven classical fantasy themes. And of course, the great voice over of the iconic and the most memorable character of the game—Aribeth.

NWN is a nostalgic game that brings up memories for many people, but it’s also worth playing to finally get on the subject and experience this classic game.

The bad thing is the glitchs are pretty terrible. I almost think they are worse in the enhanced edition over the platinum.  

I had made a cleric but when I got to the beggers nest a good chunk of the zombies became immortal. I think the exp rate was a bit messed up or might be because my cleric had high wisdom. Can't remember if Wisdom effects exp like it did in planescape.  But I was lvl 7 and my henchman could not even hurt the zombies but they could hurt us. My fighter made it into chapter 2 but the glitchs he faced also got worse. Tho the first act was somewhat fine. Doors disappeared and he got stuck lucky after total shut down of game and reload fixed that. There was also some door switchs in the prison area that should work but din't my guys keep running into the side but did not activate. In act 2 all the cult guys just vanished as did some other quest givers. Checked multiple guides but none of the characters in the guides or cult locations seemed to be the same.  The henchman and summons seem pretty bad. They tend to just stand there and often don't attack or take 4 or 5 rounds to make a move. I hope they remake this game and fix the glitchs would be far more enjoyable. 

I still have a fun time playing it mind you the only thing I wish they remade the class Pale master. The class itself is just.....goofy. Mind you it does give great defence. The offence is just terrible tho. I think there is only one decent build out there and thats the uhh think death lord build? Might be dread lord. But either way the class setup is just dumb. OH lets have a wizard turn into a tank. Give it a crap touch attack wackload of AC and some crap undead summons. Tho the demo lich might be good but most of the lower lvl summons seem crap. That's the other issue with the game.  Some class's get super over powered which is fun but other class's.....I don't think anyone likes the ranger. Other then a cross class maybe. I think summons could have been done better. With having more summons out or feats to boost their strength. 

This is just the base game I have not added any mods or anything. Anyway I know it seems I was hating on the game but I swear I do love it after all this is the 3rd time I bought it lol I can't find my cds anymore seen on steam and was like ohhh.

The game is appropriately large in scale as you start of as a brand new adventurer and then work your way up to fighting dragons and demigods across 4 chapters, each with their own unique environments, characters, and engaging stories that are interesting to go through. After the main campaign there's also two DLC campaigns (Hoards of the Underdark is my favorite one) as well as user made content which i've never tried but probably ranges from horrible to pretty good like most user made content.

My biggest warning of the game is that it's quite hard; these are older D&D rules so for people used to 5e rules these might feel restrictive with less options, and by the 3rd chapter of the game enemies do so much damage that you need to have a ton or armor and resistances to survive which means stealthy rogues and mages are probably going to get their shit kicked in.

Overall I recommend the game because it's fun to experience even if you can't always finish it so if you're a fan of older RPG's the game will definitely scratch that itch.

I even had one instance when my Rogue would not disarm a trap. They never said it was too complex they just stand their. But my favorite is if you attack a boss and get wiped.

It's not, and going into it expecting it to be like BioWare's first major RPG is going to seriously undermine your enjoyment of this game. The combat systems are very different, BG based off of 2e rules and being more luck-based, NWN based off of 3.5e rules and being more skills-based. NWN's combat is also slightly slower paced than BG's, and it provides a wider range of spells and abilities, which you can use to greater strategic effect. Movement is a bit on the lumbering side and feels much more awkward than it does in BG, but it's not so bad that it severely hampers gameplay, and is perfectly manageable once you get used to it.

The story is also pretty good, at least for most of the included (and downloadable) campaigns. Granted, the vanilla campaign isn't anything special, but ""Shadows of Undrentide"" and ""Hordes of the Underdark"" are both fantastic and more than make up for that. ""Shadowguard"" is also pretty good, and ""Darkness Over Daggerford"" is excellent. And while I haven't played ""Kingmaker"" yet, I've heard good things about that one as well. 

While certainly not perfect, ""Neverwinter Nights"" is still one of my favorite games and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes a good fantasy RPG.

It has the feel of baldurs gate and its predecessors. Interesting progression, involved building of character, options to truly engaged in the setting.

But then something weird happens, I log in one day and my wizard is invisible ( I cant even see my character, items etc, even unable to summon familiar.) Perhaps this is an issue with the server, but after googling and looking for fixes asking dms there is no fix so far. Even logging into the game causes it to crash with this character. This made the game unplayable. This was only an issue with certain characters. Why play if you cant see your avatar?

1) the path finding is really bad causing your character to flail around when trying to get around a corner.

2) the collision detection is over sensitive, Every nook and corner you'll get caught on. It makes navigating to be a nightmare in close quarters. 

3)combat feels weird and you never know if you're actually attacking. Also targeting will cause you to move and make any other enemies have opportunities of attack most of the time.

4)spellcasting is the worst, and is why people hate 2nd edition of DnD. at low levels you have 1, a single use of a spell until you rest again. And the includes cantrips; so once you use the MAIN POINT OF A CLASS in this first 2 enemies of a dungeon and get mobbed and die it's a little frustrating to say the least.

5)ranged attacks are almost impossible to aim! if your target moves you start moving straight to them to
melee range, then you just get squished trying to get out of there. 

6)the tutorial is pretty much just text boxes. Not much help spewing a 3 paragraph at me telling me keystrokes.

I got this game cause one of my friends liked it and wanted to play it with me, but I just ended up hating the game cause I started with a wizard.

First things first, there is no new content here, Enhanced Edition is a shiny new coat of paint that is betrayed by the grime underneath constantly showing its face. There's only a small handfull of servers worth playing on, while many are broken, buggy messes. Meanwhile NWN classic has dozens upon dozens of servers available with decades of content. Engine quirks are still rampant, oddities abound, 15 year old bugs are still not fixed, and almost nothing has been done to address these issues. 

If I wasn't forced to buy this product I never would have. Unfortunately Beamdog disabled the ability of classic clients to connect to 'Enhanced' servers in early alpha, and if the server you're on has switched, you either abandon all you've done and are doing there or pony up some cash. While all Single Player content is backwards and front-wards compatible, on-line, mysteriously, is not, despite being that way for a short time in the early alpha.

The single player content works, exactly the same as it did before, but now you get bloom and ambient occlusion and depth of field.

Sound, at the moment, is a total crap shoot. Audio mixing is totally broken, resulting in menu's transitioning from overwhelmingly loud to silent, footsteps going from inaudible to deafening, and fires doing the same. I thought it was simply me, but after looking around I have learned that Beamdog just ruined the stereo/surround mixing at some point in the process and have not fixed it. If you wear headphones, expect sounds to the right of your character and camera perspective to be coming from the left speaker, or mixed to be 'behind' you despite being in the front, and sometimes randomly working ok. It's quite unusual to have someone remaining stationary in front of you casting buff spells, and having each individual spell sounding like it's coming from a different place.

Do not buy unless you're forced to. The amount of content added by EE is less then what you get in a free update from more traditional game developers.

Edited to correct a mention of 'beta' to 'alpha,' and to correct some personal bias. Edited again once the sound issue I was having was a NWN:EE issue and not my own doing.

As a fan of the game when it first came out, it did not age well. You can't put blame on the graphics..it is an old game.
The problem is that it is not optimized for new computers unless you turn off all or most of the ""enhanced"" features.
I have read about people having the same over heating problems for a game that can run on a tablet.

The game play is rather dull where combat is concerned. You point click and watch. If you are going to do this get Baldurs Gate as it is better suited for auto combat.

There are also problems with getting workshop content to show up in the aurora tool set. The aurora tool set is probably the number one selling point as it helps create a virtual D&D experience.

A classic game that should be left back in time, nothing really feels updated, even with the new features.

It's made a few strides forward in terms of updates that fix or update functionalities compared to Diamond Edition, but some older bugs have reared their heads at the same time. For long time players of online servers or Persistent Worlds, EE is somewhere around a seven forward, three steps back deal. It's overall an improvement, adding things that the server development community has wanted for a very long time, but there's still a lot left to be desired. Updates continue to come out at an occasional pace and for anyone seriously interested in playing or developing an online server, I'd recommend checking the large amount of changelogs that Beamdog has published to get an idea for what's different and what's improved.

For people who solely want to enjoy NWN as a single player RPG, you won't as much of a reason to grab Enhanced Edition if you can get access to, or already have, Diamond Edition. There's a few interesting changes for the single player experience and overall performance, but not enough for the pricetag.

TL;DR, don't bother if you're only interested in the single player, go find a copy of Diamond Edition on the cheap. For people interested in playing online, EE has mostly been a positive improvement to many servers and has also seen roughly a doubling of populations on the most popular servers, for good and for bad.

HOWEVER: The 3D graphics scheme doesn't cut it - I know back in the day it was a milestone, like going to the Moon - the next logical step in graphics after isometric Baldur's Gate so on (and other games like WoW would take up this kind of 3D graphics and actually succeed). So, now we can see that the even older Baldur's Gate etc. had better graphics, and that their older isometric graphics are what Neverwinter Nights desperately needs to be totally great (as opposed to half great). It's half great because the mechanics with all their wonderful nuance honed in decades of D&D playing are there! - but the quaint charm of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale - those older titles by the same company - are missing. If you could take the game mechanics and put them in Baldur's Gate, then the game would be perfect; and if you used present-day isometric graphics as in Pillars of Eternity, then the game would blow all RPGs out of the water... a money-maker and all-time classic waiting to be created.

Initial review: Updates to the Mac OS in the past several years have made playing Neverwinter Nights with Wine impossible. However, as of March 27th this is no longer the case. That's pretty good because at last I can satisfy my curiousity! I've done the character creation several times, and it is all certifiably old school. The game mechanics are 3e. What I want now is ACHIEVEMENTS.

Update: Oh! THERE ARE NOW ACHIEVEMENTS!!!

2nd Update: Why do all the achievements have the same image/icon? That needs to be remedied (which I'm sure it will, so I'm waiting lol).

3rd UPDATE: It's now possible (again) to play the original Neverwinter Nights thro' WINE on a Mac. I get the impression that the original non-enhanced plays more smoothly than the Enhanced Edition. A way to fix this is to uncheck all the video buffer rate options.

CONCLUSION...

Well, here's something I don't want to say. The game is called the ""Enhanced Edition,"" but I feel the proper term would be ""Steam Edition."" Enhanced would mean the graphics would run streamlined and fast - super fast because the game is old... but the graphics are still clunky, and often even clunkiER. Obviously you don't play the game for the graphics - which is to say  a LOT for how AWESOME the game mechanics are. Take a look at D&D Players Manual for Editions 3 or 3.5 - get into that, and then play...

...If you're a Dungeon Master into coding and design, you can use this game engine to design your own multiplayer modules. However the RPG designer is hidden or missing, or ""un-enhanced"". It was already loopy in the original - and needs to be unlooped rather than hidden. Otherwise it's a resource lost in time, or known only to the initiated. But for those in the know, it makes Neverwinter Nights not primarily a game, but a computerized system to help people play 3rd edition. You can think of the modules that come with the game as examples and tours of what can be done.

...Which means:

...just like Nietzsche said of the human race - that what's great about it is not that it's a goal that has been achieved, but that it is a bridge to achieving a worthwhile goal. Since originally NWN came out (almost 2 decades ago), there have been many computer RPGs. Yet the very fact that NWN would make a comeback indicates the goal of a GREAT COMPUTER RPG has not yet been quite accomplished - all attempts have been seriously flawed. This is one of the least flawed CRPGs. Where others may succeed graphically, Neverwinter Nights is one of the few, likely the ONLY, CRPG to succeed with near flawlessness with the game mechanics. That's due to 1) D&D 3rd edition rocks, and 2) NWN sincerely and authentically has D&D 3rd Edition rules... NWN seems coded around the rules, instead of the rules being made up ad hoc to simplify the coding.

Neverwinter Nights is one of the top 10 CRPGS that exist. It's the one with perfect game mechanics. Pillars of Eternity is the one with perfect graphics. Put the two together - someone! - and make yourself a heap of gold... PLEASE! There are hordes of fans waiting.",1522256250,1592320123,True,2,0,0.453140586614608765,0,True,False,False

My advice still stands. Unless you want to play on certain MP server which requires enhanced edition, do not buy.

Beamdog promised a new renderer, and failed to deliver it, what's more on more than one occasion they introduced bugs that didn't exist before. (stuff like dispel difficulty of wands, characters not showing heads, etc). Framebuffer effects do not really look good, performance is worse compared to diamond edition, and performance did not improve.They also managed to break HoTU at some point, and I'm not sure if it was fixed.

While there are some improvements, like ability to download content automatically instead of hunting for hacks, I have no faith in current developer's ability to tackle technical issues.

As a result, if you have nostalgia, your best choice is Diamond Edition and original Neverwinter Nights, which is not currently available on steam.  And not enhanced edition.

[b]Original Review: (86 hours playtime):[/b]

Well. 

Long story short:

[b]Unless you want to play on arelith,  [i]DO NOT BUY.[/i][/b]

One GOOD thing about this version is that it starts MUCH faster than the original. Goes to the menu in split second.

However, there are issues:

[list]
[*]Audio is busted. Stereo effect doesn't work properly, the game frequently loses track of which direction the camera faces, and you can end up with reverse stereo, muffled sounds, etc. It is quite bad and fairly disorienting.
[*]Performance is horrible. The framerate can drop as low as 1/8th or 1/10th of the original. Basically, the game can't handle transparent surfaces now, and in area with a lot of glowy stuff you could get [b]TEN[/b] fps where you were previously getting sixty.  TEN. On hardware that can handle witcher 3, with all the framebuffer effects disabled. This is nonsense.
[*]Some colors for armor are messed up and do not look like the original did.
[*]There are no noteworthy visual improvements. Framebuffer effects do not do anything useful. Well, ambient occlusion does some subtle shadows, but nothing spectacular... but anything else is nonsense.
[*]UI scaling is haphazard. Basically, they just increase buttons by a fixed factor. Meaning in FullHD you'll still most likely will want to have the original tiny UI.

When coming into this enhanced edition of a classic game, that I kind of grew up with, don't expect intense party management. When playing this game, expect an adventure focused more on YOU as a hero, and your rise to face classic monsters or villains of all kinds. 

As usual, we have the classic Dungeons and Dragons elements from Baldur's Gate and other games. Feats, skills, and intensely satisfying character progression. It will keep you hooked and chasing that next piece of legendary loot, or that powerful feat that will make you transform into a revered hero. 

The biggest problem, however, is that there are many elements of Neverwinter Nights that are copy/paste. Caves, dungeons, towns, cities, and more tend to look identical but with different layouts. There's a lot of elements that are designed, on purpose, for easy community customization. Hence custom modules, AKA campaigns. However, this also means there ARE custom weapons, armor, monsters, textures, objects, and more. The performance is also god awful. Beamdog is currently working on a better rendering engine, but this game WILL run poorly even on a powerful PC. So be warned! This problem occurs worst in the premium modules such as Tyrants of the Moonsea.

Neverwinter Nights also has an odd difficulty curve, although it made me feel powerful on multiple occasions. Enemies are either too easy, and go down with little effort, or are way too difficult. There are enemies that the game will claim are ""Effortless"" challenge rating, but will kick your butt, which is just strange. But I suppose there is nothing wrong with having fodder to test how mighty you are. The copy/paste elements are also just not that bad, I wanted to keep playing and wanted to keep experiencing new stories, delving into mysterious dungeons even if many of them looked the same but with different layouts. New campaigns add new things, so check them out if the original campaign grows too stale, although I was able to play through it just fine and it was delightful. There are some issues here and there with this enhanced edition of the classic game, but you can't go wrong with this wonderful roleplaying experience!

Beamdog's Enhanced Edition fixes that problem and it runs quite nicely.  I'd highly recommend the game for anyone wanting to take an extended trip down memory lane or anyone who wants to experience what D&D games were like back in the day without the antiquated mechanics of the Gold Box games or the hassle of trying to put together a Win9x environment. If you go in expecting the game to be anything other than what it is/was, you will be deeply disappointed. But if you expect it to be a classic game that runs well in a modern environment, you will be pleasantly surprised at how well they have handled that. 

While Beamdog has tidied up many aspects, it is essentially the same game that ran on Bioware's old Aurora engine, so expect blocky graphics, limited voicing, heaps of D&D tropes, and all the rest of the baggage that goes along with a game from 2003. Some of the old annoyances are still there (pathfinding is still not great, for example), and a few new ones have been introduced (volume level adjustments will be needed), but it is nothing game-breaking and has been a real blast from the past as far as I am concerned. All of the premium modules are included, so it is basically what used to be the Diamond Edition, and there are scads of player-created stuff out there because the toolkit (one of the most versatile ones ever done) has also been updated. Check out the ""Module a Day"" thread on the discussion board for some really good suggestions. (EDIT: the Neverwinter Vault moved from IGN's servers to its own domain, so can be found at neverwintervault.org.)

At the time I am writing this, I have 34 hours sunk into it and have just moved into Chapter 2 of the original campaign. There are so many things to do that this will not be a game that moves along quickly. It is based on the AD&D 3rd Ed. rule set, so there might be a bit of learning curve for some/most players, especially if they are coming out of any of Beamdog's other remasters (Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, etc.) that were based on the 2nd Ed. rule set, or if they are not familiar with AD&D  conventions.

However the story is actually really cool and as it's based off of 3rd Edition of D&D it's a great to be exposed to a tabletop game in video game format, especially for younger generations who may not have a large enough attention span to sit and do the math every single time you roll an attack or cast a spell, at the very least it worked for me and now that I'm much older I play D&D (3.5). 

If anyone is looking for a change in pace picking up this game and playing through it really gives you a wonderful experience, the adventure is so much fun and as long as you can laugh at the silly graphics and still enjoy your time while taking just a few moments to understand how to play and make a character then this is definitely worth playing.

Original review:
Seems pretty cool. I am enjoying playing the newer content, and have completed several of the modules. I liked them, except for the seemingly aimless wandering in Godfell and Godfell: Baator. I enjoy at least a hint of a quest in my games! I think these worlds might be more fun as a multi-player game with a DM creating some additional quests. In Land of Thuul, I did eventually find the old king, but the Druid Grandmaster remains unfound. >:)

I experienced some inconsistencies with the NPC AI mod. In the Land of Thuul, my mage's pixie familiar only gave me plain boxes. And when I finally got to where I could hire a henchman, I couldn't open his inventory at all. Poor dude ended up overburdened by the weight of all his duplicated gear, as he got another copy every time I went up a level. I bought him some neat stuff, but couldn't put it on him. Weirdly, I could ask him to give me his stuff, but I couldn't give him any back. Ah well. He only died a lot. ;-) He also lacked the ability to identify his own gear, and could therefore not wear the really cool stuff he had. (If I ID'd it, I couldn't get it back on him.) I played an assassin in Baator, so I had no familiar, but the AI modification worked great with the NPC helpers.

I've sampled some of the other modules, and I was able to use the Pretty Good Character mod, but only when making a new character. I tried to reenter after I ran through Thuul, but the game crashed EVERY TIME. <sigh> I only tried 20 or 30 times, so I suppose it's possible it might have eventually worked, but...
Lastly, I am seriously unamused that I have to run this game through Steam. I have a lively PC, lovingly named ""Grandma's Gamer"" due to the higher end video card, extra memory, and terabyte hard drive. When I try to play during what I assume are peak times (evenings here on the US East Coast) and weekends, the game seriously bogs gown. Loading times are doubled or tripled, transitions between areas lag, spell effects are also laggy, etc. If I wasn't used to how it played before, I might not notice it so much. 

BTW, this is how I begin a new game with an existing character or load a saved game: pull up program, click on load game or new game w/ existing character. Wander off and do something for 5 minutes, read a chapter in a book, whatever. Come back, find my character/saved game, click it, wander back off for a bit/read another chapter while I wait for it to load... Just loading a game is an ordeal spanning at least 10 minutes of boring torture. Oh, and if I try to rush it? The whole game crashes and I get to start all over again. Yay. The only good news is that I finally learned how to tell the difference between the ""thinking about it"" and ""ready for you to click"" screens. I can only assume that this delay is because I have to go through Steam to play. Before I got the Enhanced Edition, it was MUCH faster.

So, final analysis? I'd say 8 out of 10 Fireballs. Colors, spell (& other) effects, gear & content are a lot of fun. When it works, it is awesome.  When it doesn't work, it sucks. But with some patience, I've figured a way around many of the glitchy parts. I got mine on sale. I don't think I would pay the full price, but the sale price was very nice. Keep up the good work, I think you developers are doing a good job. Looking forward to more content! Also, anyone know how to play without linking to the Internet?

If you're expecting massive improvements upon the original you might be somewhat sad to know that this title doesn't offer that (yet). However, it is a classic, still best in the genre with a studio actively maintaining it for modern platforms. 'nuf said. Want more?

What makes this title special is the modding. The game comes with an editor that allows you to fully customize everything from weapons to story telling. Mods range from LOTR to Starwars and people host all sorts of servers for almost any type of experience.

Just like the original the Linux client works nicely, I have heard of different experiences using the editor in Wine, but for me it works OK.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that some times has passed since the rerelease of this game and Beamdog have delivered loads of positive changes to the engine.

This game is like having a favorite fantasy collection of short stories in which new chapters are endlessly produced, at no extra charge.

Sure, the interface is a bit clunky, harkening back to the days when 3D gaming was in its teen years of learning what it was capable of, but it's completely playable and becomes second nature, even for an old fogey like me.

The simplicity, yet complexity (depending how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go) is a work of art. You can play it as simply as you want or spend days and weeks theorycrafting the perfect character, with hundreds and hundreds of adventures to entertain or challenge them.

The adventures themselves range from professional to amateur, massive trilogies to simple dungeon crawlers, storycentric adventures to nonstop warzones.

Basically, you just can't go wrong with this title. One game, one price, and you get an adventure that never ends. Create all new characters for each, or import/export characters at will to carry on your own adventure within them.

I still have the game disk with Bioware's logo on it, even if I don't have a disk drive to run it on.  By the time I stopped using Xfire, I'd logged 300+ hours on it playing NWN.  It catalyzed a discovery of, and eventual addiction to, Dungeons and Dragons and Elder Scrolls.

This is an example of a studio in its prime.  With the technical limitations of that time period, they were able to tell a detailed story that you could lose yourself in, with rich backgrounds and deep characters.  It laid the foundation for later titles such as The Witcher and Dragon Age. 

All that gushing aside:
- The control system could be better, to the point that it toes the line between ""just off"" and ""janky"".
- The graphics haven't aged well.  
- The main characters are voiced but the rest of it is entirely text which, if you're not 100% immersed in the game, will become hard to read after a while.
- It's looking to celebrate its 2nd decade of being a thing, don't expect the online playerbase to be active.

I’m actually one of the few people who think Neverwinter Nights 2(at least the official campaigns) was a lot better its predecessor. It is, of course, because I played NWN2 before 1 as I was very busy during 2002-2007 and never got down to playing many new games. It may also be because I played NWN2 after the SoZ expansion, which remedied most of its poor camera mode issues. And of course, MOTB has one of the best RPG stories ever written and a truly breathtaking atmosphere.

Still, that doesn’t mean NWN 1 is bad after all these years. In fact, playing through it for hours recently, I think I understand why more people prefer NWN1 over 2. Originally released in early 2000’s, the story is rather weak and the ‘henchman’ system is extremely poor and hampers your strategy as you can’t fine-control him/her. It reminds me of the mercenary system in Diablo 2 and there’s no excuse for that in a non-ARPG.

But the biggest strength of NWN1 is its almost unlimited supply of user-created modules. I was playing NWN1 campaign a few days ago and thinking how I didn’t like any of the characters- or lack thereof-, but playing some of the modules I downloaded from NWvault, I noticed that NWN1 doesn’t inherently have to be hack&slash. There are lots of recommendations for fan-created NWN1 modules online, and they are all highly enjoyable, much more so than the OC, so I feel comfortable recommending this game to all roleplaying game fans who like immersion into the storyline.

Back when NWN originally released in 2002, my wife and I were first in line. We played the heck out of it for years, eventually teaming up with fellow enthusiasts and creating an entire world on a persistent server, with several DMs catering to a sizable group of regular players.  Naturally, the Toolset was a key component for us to be able to create cities, towns, wilderness, dungeons, and scripts to make it all run. 

At the behest of a few of those former teammates, I finally bought the NWNEE, and played a quick session. It ran smoothly, and despite its aged graphics, it was a lot of fun. Naturally the experience gave me the itch to build some areas, so today I tried to load up the Toolset.

But...there is no Toolset for Mac users. Which led me to the discovery that there is no DM Client for Mac users either.

That being said what brings the score down from what would have been a 9 or a ten is that I ran into several bugs and glitches. Several times I ran into a bug where my character would disappear and i would be fighting while fighting invisibly, and there were several smaller graphical hiccups. I also ran into a bug at the very beginning where it wasn't allowed to use full-screen mode and i had to alter the settings file in my documents to manually set it into full-screen.

In Conclusion 7.5/10
Solid old school RPG, but with minor bugs and glitches that might require work around's.

This game is, by no means, perfect but I still enjoy it. It's a much simpler, hack-and-slashy brother of classics like Baldur's Gate which is something I just needed for the days I'm too tired to throw myself into a huge plot or too tactical gameplay.
Neverwinter Nights is just a perfect game when you simply wanna relax while still having a competent RPG experience. Just remember that the graphics have aged a lot, as did the AI of your mercenaries and summons.

After 100% the game I have some new observations:
1) I dislike that there are achievements that are ONLY for  high level wizards and sorcerers. Makes me feel like they are privileged. It forced me to play as a wizard even though I like druids and clerics way more. They (and tons of other classes) however do not get any exclusive achievements at all. Also getting all the ""baby achievements"" was a drag. 
2) The ""Shadows of Undertide"" and ""Hordes of Underdark"" content tends to be  a mixed bag. There are cool things, like elite classes, epic skills, spells etc. However, there are also some pretty silly ""puzzles"", like the Mimic one. It dragged way too long to lure that fellow where he should be. Also there seem to be way more quests which only character with specific skills can fully complete, like the kobolds in the kitchen.
3)  I had to kill Mephistopheles on hardcore two times because the ""hardcore"" achievement did not pop at first. Not really too difficult once find the right way (acid), but still.

Still a fun game.",1583272041,1586082595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

5 nights ago I decided to search the Steam store on a whim, just to see if it was available. It was, and it was also on sale. My sleep schedule is now majorly messed up but I have never progressed this far in the game, ever. I just exited for a bit to write this review and then I'm going back in. 

Graphics-wise, the characters are a bit blocky but obvs v high-tech for that time, and honestly everything still looks and moves smoothly, and it's aged really well. I still have to run my cursor over every stone to check that it's not a loot bag I might have missed. Is that a pro or con, I'll leave that to you to decide.

Pros:
-All-in-one package - original game and all the expansions 
-Old-school RP - you are not forced to play a hero, you can play like a villain or an indiffirent vvanker, its up to you.
-Decent story and lore, with a great immersion into the world of D&D/Faerun
-Mods and coop player-run servers

Cons:
-Didn't age well - combat/class system far inferior to NWN2, same can be said for companion system. Some level designs would be a nightmare for new generation players. 
-Stupid unavoidable puzzles
-Some lore things and characters are very unnatural logic-wise, Villains behave too cartoonish and unrealistic (especially in HoTU). But well - D&D have always been this way.
-Graphics are better than original game thats for sure, but not much better. Just slightly better textures - and thats pretty much it.
-Not much branching, mostly linear progression - you have control over [i]how[/i] you will solve issues, not [i]what[/i] issues will you solve (with a few minor exceptions).

The new server listing from Beamdog allows for seamless joining of servers, no more sifting for direct connections or .hak packs to manually put in your directory, everything will be found and is automatically able to be downloaded in-game. There are guides everywhere for anyone who wants to use a picture they made/found as a portrait for their character, and almost every server you join will be a completely new world to explore, hand-tailored by the Owner and DM group. Of course since everything is made by the community you can't expect it without its bugs, but people are very understanding and generally will help you out, it's the player input that helps identify them to be fixed. Altogether it makes for a really great experience, just be wary that like D&D a lot of the servers you join will be designed for a party to complete, so you may find it difficult to venture on your own, this is where you get to roleplay with other characters (Honestly the best part in my opinion) and go out on harrowing adventures, or you can just have a little fun as you watch and participate in conversation with unique people. As all games with multiplayer content there is bound to be trolls, luckily the DMs generally dislike them as much as you do so if they notice a troll in the act (I don't suggest calling for a DM about little events but if it is generally rule-breaking it is opportune to let them know) they'll promptly handle it. It is a good idea to read up on how a server is before joining so you can find the niche that fits you best, some servers are more forgiving than others, some servers have more players, and some servers use custom assets and rules. All in all a great purchase if you like classic RPGs, and is diverse enough to fit those who like roleplay and those who like combat respectively. The campaign is good for those who are learning the controls (they can be a bit sloppy feeling at first) and has a very good story to it. Definitely worth the purchase and stands to the test of time right up with the original.",1585475024,1585475024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 The ""magic of NWN"" was always ability to create your own adventures, realms, and PWs ( persistent worlds.)  , and be able to actually role-play with others multiplayer wise. 

 Single-player is NOT a RPG , period. 

 While EE fixes the old broken means of seeing servers online, you buy this garbage wich is 100% incompatible with the Diamond version, which is still far superior because it has no bugs, no constant breaking updates, works for and souly on computer ( you console and mobile players , sorry ...) , so theres no cross over buggy mess. 

 The toolset crashes all the time. It is NOT fixed.  
Without the toolset, the game is utter garbage ... flat out a waste of time and money.

I will update this review as time goes by but for now I have only played the original campaign.
Neverwinter Nights Original Campaign: Fun experience but the story is cut and dry, basically a tech demo for the Aurora engine and a stepping stone on what this engine is capable of. Still golden soundrack and fun dungeons. Act 2 finally picked up the pace of the story with expansive colors and vibrant hub world. 
8/10 but I had to change this to 7/10 because of Act 3 which is the same thing as Act 2 but worse, more tedious search for objects which are defended by horrific enemies that can wreck a party in seconds and the more than 1 henchman system is not introduced here so if you didnt pick a Tanking class then you might have to restart the whole experience. Indeed move on to the other modules and expansions which are way more fun

Pirates of the Sword Coast: Absolutely brilliant, the game design is improved compared to main campaign and the story is better. The vibe is fantastic and I really would say this is one of the best DND experiences with a mate. New features include the booty system and survival element in the opening. 10/10 would oil bomb the boss again.",1583438010,1584273277,True,5,1,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

Would I recommend it as a straight game? Well... maybe. I fully admit I have never played it properly - Beamdog have updated the graphics and brought it to Steam but they've kept the console commands in there; you can still find the old cheats somewhere on the internet. I still find it immensely fun to rock around with a level 40 character smashing zombies and demons in the face, so it's a good time for that. However I am progressing through the story in normal difficulty, albeit at a slower pace. As I level (and try out uber-levelled characters) I find myself feeling like I have made many mistakes in my character build, which makes me want to start again - as it's based around an older version of Dungeons & Dragons, it's easy to get the wrong synergy if you have most recent memories of 5e.

I have played since it released in 2002.  This is my 3rd copy, Original and Diamond.  I have still never managed to get far in the single player story.  I have spent 1000s of hours on player made servers having a blast.  I bought this copy to test it against gogs & have a copy for a friend.  Both versions have advantages, but I wouldn't mind doing some achievements here, so I might try single player again.  I just always get caught up playing online because *real people* are what make D&D so captivating.  

I have encountered all of the most kind and hateful sides of humanity here.  I have been a drow elf who was racially targeted and with time I became a helpful druid (before I read about Drizzt btw) hero to the overworld.  I have RPed a drow bent on wiping out the overworld.  Most of these Player Made worlds are very intricate and well done, some being almost 20 years old now, constantly cared for by dedicated player communities.  
There are servers to grind XP, PvP, RP, etc.  Short of going and finding a brilliant group to RP with, NwN is the next best thing.  When we started there was no way to talk, so it was all typing.  Now you can find groups that play on Dischord, keeping each zone as a separate chat room.  There is some brilliant stuff going on here, still. 

The soundtrack is genius.  Jeremy (& Julian) Soule deserves to be regarded with the greats, like  Howard, Williams, and Uemastu.  You might know his work from SKYRIM.  If you enjoy that, here are many more songs in that style.  The soundtrack alone is worth your time and money.  I enjoy writing & painting to Soule's music.  This is one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.

The editor is fun and very satisfying.  I prefer NwN2 here, but this is still excellent as a mod / campaign creation tool, for digital or analogue games.  The system teaches one a lot about 3e, but also teaches how to do conversation flow for quests, how to balance items, monster levels, etc.  

After such a long stay of popularity in the Cult Classic section of gaming, Neverwinter Nights has proved itself in the test of time.  You are not getting a failure here that will run out of players in 6 months.  This game has lasted 17 years or so.  These players are dedicated to the 3e rules system and this is the best way to play it.  'Every skill check is automatic', might be the best argument to play this if you love 3e, as it speeds up the game to almost real-time.  We still bow and talk RP on most servers before PvP, but in arena mods it's all players stats and click for your life.  IF you like TOp-down, oldschool graphics RPGs where the guts of the mechanics makeup for the pretty effects, this is for you.  A real thinking-person's game.  Neverwinter Nights will go down in history, while most of the games we play will be long forgotten.

[b]Summary: [/b]Neverwinter Nights was a great game, and really solidified bringing the concept of Tabletop RPGs to the world of gaming. That said, I would struggle to say Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition has actually enhanced much of import. Widescreen and Mod Support are welcome additions, but why is the performance so freaking awful? This is a 20 year old game! My RTX 2060 Super should not be pushing out 20 FPS on this. And the original Diamond Edition didn't have this problem.

For the uninitiated, Neverwinter Nights is a top-down real time tactical RPG set in the Forgotten Realms universe of Dungeons and Dragons. Like in Dungeons and Dragons, you create a character sheet, and play one of several campaigns and modules that come included. Stats, Classes, Feats, Spells, etc. etc., all of the RPG classic tropes you might come to expect. Rather than turn-based combat, NWN opts for a pseudo-real-time system in combat: rolls, moves, and actions are queued up behind the scenes, and executed at timed intervals to give the feeling of real-time combat, but combat can still be paused the queued actions can be changed at will of future turns.

I pumped a ton of hours into this game, and I would consider them well spent. If you like RPGs, this is truly one of the greats. This comes highly recommended. The original campaign is pretty underwhelming, and contains a B movie plot involving your typical Bioware Precursor Race™ and contains very little of the good writing of later modules and expansion packs. Honestly, you could probably just start with Shadows of Undrenide, and skip the main campaign altogether, and lose very little in the way of story.

What does the Enhanced Edition add? Well, beyond just making it accessible on Steam, it adds a few new features, and I'll break those down on whether or not these are good changes or not:

* [b]Improved Display[/b]: UI elements are designed to scale properly with Widescreen, HD, and 4K displays. The original game already did this to some extent, but the enhanced edition improves on this somewhat, especially with the text: Text did NOT scale with resolution changes in the retail release of the game.
* [b]Advanced Graphics Options[/b]: You'll probably turn most of these off, as they don't function particularly well. Vibrance and DoF, specifically, just make the entire game look janky, although YMMV.
* [b]Backwards Compatibility:[/b] Meh. It's still the same game, so all the old stuff still works. At least that makes it better than Warcraft III: Reforged.
* [b]Steam Feature Support[/b]: Workshop makes installing mods super easy. I hate Steam Cloud, and I didn't try the multiplayer, mostly because I remember it sucking in the original game. Maybe they fixed it, Idk.
* [b]Restored Multiplayer[/b]: Meh. See above.
* [b]Cancelled Modules restored[/b]: The DLC available for purchase here were modules under development that were cancelled, or never completed for various reasons. Tyrants of Moonsea, Darkness Over Daggerford, Infinite Dungeons, Kingmaker, and practically everything else on that list is seeing the light of day for the first time ever. Your mileage may vary on the quality of those modules, but a few of them are worth checking out, at least.

Some cons though:
* As mentioned before, there are some serious performance issues that were not at all present in the original game. Intel Processors are especially susceptible. Some crashing will occur, so remember to save.
* Everything clunky about the original game was preserved for posterity. It's still an old game, with old design paradigms.
* Since the cinematics now use WEBM format rather than BINK, any older modules that have cinematics will absolutely refuse to work unless you find a way to convert it. (I haven't.)

Anywho, I still obviously recommend it. I loved playing it, despite it's problems. However, if you've already got Diamond Edition already installed on your computer and it works great, this purchase may not be an added value for you. It's more of a touch-up than a remaster.",1581226337,1581226337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't do reviews, but I am absolutely stunned by how poor this remaster is. The graphics and general presentation, for a remaster, are nothing short of pathetic (lack of UI options, sludgy camera/movement, etc). I got stuck in a bookcase having not saved 30 mins in, meaning a restart. When NWN first came out it looked poor in comparison to the far older Baldur's Gate II, both graphics and gameplay. Today it's embarrassing. Beamdog had the IP and structure to make a great remaster, instead they added a few resolutions, some compatibility fixes and a £30 price tag. At a far lower price, as a DM toolset maybe it's ok, as a singleplayer game it's a joke. 

Yes I'm sure it isn't easy. But if you can't do something, don't do it. This EE is lazy, through and through. 
-Order savegames by most recent first? Can't be bothered. 
-Pathfinding? What's pathfinding?
-On killing an enemy, how about they stand still, seemingly fine for a few seconds, then fall over? Check. 
-Immersion-breaking, idiotic henchman AI? Who cares, why not.
-Barren, soulless, identical interiors, right angles and rectangles? Maybe nobody will notice. 

It's just utter, utter laziness.

If I was playing a 20y old game I would forgive the flaws, because with a bit of your own imagination and a forced nostalgic lens there's a 6/10 gameplay RPG to be enjoyed. However the fact this is a recent remaster is ridiculous. This should be freeware, at a push I would give a qualified recommendation if the whole lot was under £5 at full price. I'm going to trudge through it now I have it but if you have literally anything else even remotely tempting in your library then play that (you can see from steam achievement % that this is what people actually do. It would appear 19 in 20 owners of the game have never played it).

This is unplayable do not purchase this trash.

Update: now that the crashing issue is solved there game will delete your saved games when you try to save over the older file. In addition the game will randomly decide to murder everyone in the party at the lowest difficulty setting.

Way to screw up a game, developers. I can't get a refund for this game, but the random deaths are more frequent than Dark Souls. The only difference is Dark Souls is fair, this game isn't.

Update: the game is currently again unplayable as frame crashes into the single digits before a pop up displays saying the ""game crashed hard."" Do not buy this game. You are wasting your money.

Update as of December 2019: The graphics update has left the game in a completely unplayable state. They fixed the game crashes and the corrupted saves.

Played it on a potato laptop and the experience is still amazing.

AI in the two expansions is horrible at best, it was the worst in HOTU since they would randomly stop attacking or never bother attacking at all despite ordering them to. Played a cleric in OC and the melee ai is responsive enough, it was capable of carrying me through the game when my damage is lacking, they functioned okay at best since it always attacks when ordered to albeit there will be delays in before the command is fulfilled, this can be compensated with the monk companion's haste so he can react quickly between understanding the command and speeding towards the enemies.

Probably played NWN around 5 times. One of my favorite mid generation CRPG's on the D&D 3.5 (at the time) rule sets. Nothing has come close even in modern Dungeons & Dragons games to being true to the rule sets. I would argue that NWN 2 tried but changed a little and the no longer available Sword Coast Legends. That was more of an ARPG with pause Mechanics to simulate a CRPG system, but it did try to incorporate the 5E rules as best as it could. I loved this game a lot and Beamdog polished it up quite a bit for modern systems, better resolution even though everything is dated model wise, it still looks beautiful. My favorite expansion is Hordes of the Underdark with that Possessed talking Sword with the soul of a wizard that insults everything you fight.

If you want something thats a true Classic RPG, this would that game. As long as you dont mind dated aesthetics.

This review is with regards to the Original Campaign only. 

I returned to NWN this year with fond memories. This was the ""real"" game I had ever played on PC, and it made me fall in love with the RPG genre. I remembered battling dragons and liches in the fight to save Neverwinter, and loving every minute.

Now, having stepped through the Enhanced Edition over a decade later, I find that the game is perhaps not quite as good as I once remembered, though certainly still playable. Though many reviewers may complain of the story, I did not find this to be a particular problem; instead, what frustrated me was how repetitive the game is. In each of the four main Acts, you are tasked with recovered 3-4 items in order to save Neverwinter, each in its own area north, south, east or west of your main location. This quickly grew tiresome, and unfortunately by Act 3 I found myself wanting the game to end. This is my main complaint. Other annoyances include the inability to control your companions inventory (my companion ended up stunned or frightened for the majority of a number of encounters, which could have been solved through itemisation), and the excessive amount of locks to be picked and traps to be disarmed. It just got tiresome.

With the negatives out of the way, the best parts of the game are the classic D&D mechanics, a strong sense of purpose in terms of pursuing the main plotline, and reward for good itemisation and skill selection. For example, cycling through Brawlers', Archers' and Swordsmans' Belts in encounters based on damage type can make the difference between victory and defeat. I definitely found myself enjoying the game for the majority of my playthrough.

With regards to the EE remake, the graphics are the same but the game did run fairly flawlessly on my modern machine, including at 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution. I had minor bugs with inventory item selection in some shops as well as problems with enemies being invisible and untargetable after returning via the Stone of Recall.

Overall I recommend this game if you are looking for a classic D&D adventure with a good dose of nostalgia. Modern players used to more polished games such as Pillars of Eternity and Dragon Age may find this game to be lacking.",1577767194,1577767194,True,2,0,0.527384281158447266,0,True,False,False

Considering the price and time that has passed since the initial release, I expected the game to be fixed completely - the not so ideal pathfinding, the AI, and some minor bugs. Sadly I got disappointed.

Some bugs are still persistent, 16 years after the original release in 2003. Pathfinding still could use a lot of work, AI doesn't seem to be improved at all. What really suprised me is that there are NEW bugs I haven't encountered before, 16 years ago. Deekin, my favorite ever NPC, keeps disappearing every time a chapter changed in both of the expansions. So far haven't resolved that and it really drains completely my desire to play the game further.

I've wasted a significant portion of my life playing on this game for a good reason; the storytelling experience when you can play on a server crafted, and wholly run, by other people who value storytelling, work creatively, and genuinely enjoy each others' company, is not to be replaced by any other game currently on the market.  I don't expect this to be replicated subsequently.  I don't expect any game will ever achieve this level of customization, or the wholehearted effort from so many people who have come together to make it what it is.

I remember reading about it in a magazine when it came out; about how it had operable DM tools, and how you could tell your own story, play your own character - even modify the scripts in the code.  They released the toolset and they let it fly.

I started using it when I was 12, and although I've never become proficient at scripting, I still use it on a regular basis to make custom maps and other resources for modules.

If you're a first-time player, my advice is to take the campaign as an extended tutorial for the toolset and multiplayer. The expansions are the superior experience in terms of both narrative and gameplay. After you've gotten used to those, go looking for a community server. There are still tons around, and they offer excellent content. Even if that isn't your thing, go look at a few servers anyway. Some are well over 15 years old, and are literal pieces of gaming history that deserve to be appreciated simply for the hours of effort that went into designing them.

Words cannot express how pissed off this makes me, because I didn't have a save from the previous chapter and flat out lost access to Deekin, the kobold bard and best companion from any game ever made. My desire to even finish the expansion is completely gone.

There's also a bugged achievement. 

If you buy this game you'll likely enjoy it, but if you don't buy it it also serves them right for not fixing such a major issue that's nearing being two decades old in the new enhanced edition.

Edit: The reply to this review from a developer is absolutely nothing but damage control. There's nothing support can do when the problems are hard coded errors in the scripting of the game. I even reported the bugged achievement (confirmed to be bugged by someone else who dug into the scripting of the game) and support just asked me if I tried restarting the game, lol. 

Anyway, after writing the above review I bit the bullet and restarted the last expansion with debug mode enabled so I could just 1 shot everything under my cursor and breeze through the game until reaching the last chapter so I could finish the game with Deekin. That said I'll write the review NWN should have, but the thumbs down will remain since Beamdog can't be bothered to fix such old bugs.

This game is very fun. Lots of people complain about it not aging well but what do they expect from a game that's 16 years old? My biggest complaint is that your ability to control your companions is very limited compared to games like Baldur's Gate, but the options for your own character are just as fleshed out as in any other D&D based game, perhaps even more so considering all the prestige classes that are available. The main campaign is okay, but the two following expansions is where the stories really get good.

Shadows of Undrentide takes place in the snowy north, a desert and heavily features kobolds and Netherese ruins. Deekin, one of the kobolds from said tribe is fed up with the whole being evil and nasty image they have and wants to be a bard who goes on heroic adventures with the ultimate goal of helping kobolds become as accepted in society as gnomes and halflings. Simply put Deekin is what makes this game absolutely amazing for me. You get to have a little kobold, fully voiced, following you around as a companion while singing as a bard and always interjecting with really funny, no filter comments about what's going on.

Deekin is no doubt the comic relief companion, but it seems like the writers really wanted him to be the one you take along with you because as far as character development goes he's 100x above and beyond everyone else. Hell, this little guy has more personality than pretty much anyone else in the entire game. He's also absolutely freaking adorable and unless you're a heartless monster you're going to want to just give him a big hug every time he says something cute.

The third expansion, Hoards of the Underdark, is by far the best of the story lines. The coolest part? Deekin returns as a companion (in fact he's the one and only companion who actually remembers you and has any continuity between expansions). The story starts out in a rather annoying dungeon full of traps but quickly moves onto the Underdark and finally ends in one of the circles of Hell. There's loads of Drow, Beholders, Illithids (Tentacle-Heads as Deekin calls them) and more types of demons than you can shake a stick at to cut a path through.

The third chapter which takes place on the plane of Cania in the Hells is especially well done. If you enjoyed Planescape: Torment you're going to have a blast here. It almost felt like an extension of Planescape with similar types of characters, extensive (quality) dialog and even the same type of slang being used by NPCs.

There's a lot to enjoy about Neverwinter Nights, but if you buy it MAKE SURE YOU READ UP ON LOSING COMPANIONS AT THE START OF CHAPTER 3 OF HOARDS OF THE UNDERDARK!!! And make sure you always take Deekin along with you!",1576118251,1576468232,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

While more of a platform than a game originally, it achieves what games like Sword Coast Legends failed to do.
By providing a robust toolset to the community, it allowed modders, designers and DMs to hand-craft their own campaigns, episodes and adventures for the entire player base to consume at will, while providing a dearth of singleplayer content which, while arguably mediocre compared to its contemporaries, is still very entertaining and provides a clear understanding of what the entire toolset is capable of providing to a dedicated developer.

The Enhanced Edition provides all of the content from the base game, as well as some crucial updates for modern systems that keep the engine and toolset breathing over 16 years later, as well as some more modern 'Premium Modules', extra, expansive content for playing in single and multiplayer without going searching the internet for community-made campaigns. There's hundreds of hours of content in this package, and most of it is wonderful.
The original campaign is inarguably the weakest of the lot, but still worth playing despite showing its age. The other modules, however, are more daring and creative than most of the 'AAA' RPGs you've seen before or since.

While a graphical update is supposedly in the works in the long term, Neverwinter Nights was never as much about visuals as it was allowing your imagination to fill in the gaps. Such an update would be greatly appreciated and would probably bring new blood into the community, but is ultimately not required for the game to shine as a platform for D&D players; the gameplay, mechanics and party adventuring is the core of the experience, and all of that is stronger for having been updated to work in the modern day. Any improvements to the UI in the future will utterly transform the game on a mechanical level in terms of intuitive control and readability, no mean feat considering the original release suffered quite heavily from a complicated interface with unintuitive interactions on first view.

I've heard comments that Beamdog is supposedly 'cash-grabbing' with this re-release, but from what I've seen so far nothing could be further from the truth. The CEO of Beamdog, Trent Oster, was the producer and project director on the original release; this is absolutely a labour of love. Heavy work appears to be going into re-writing the rendering engine in order to accommodate the new visuals that are in the works, and considering the game is receiving fixes and updates over 15 years after its original release, I couldn't be happier with the work Beamdog are doing to keep one of the greatest RPG platforms alive. You're getting a hell of a package already at the price it's selling for; any updates to visuals, improvements to the engine or extra modules are just the gold-standard icing on an already magnificent cake.

If you've played it before, you probably already own it. If you haven't, you should.

My first (re)playthrough was with a male rogue. I thought I'd be doing tons of looting (which I did) and rogues would be good at that kind of thing (no). The moment I saw Knock and Find Traps spells in action, I regretted going rogue. In the end all it did was dodge good and had the 'use magic device' (~use any gear) skill, so completing the main campaign and SoU on easy wasn't too hard. Boots of Haste were a godsend. I vaguely remember from years ago that the monk was by far the easiest class, if you're interested in cakewalks.

By far the most interesting class though is wizard. You get to learn ALL the spells, extra quests, dialogue options, whathaveyou. I did a main campaign replay + HotU (those 2 will blow your mind repeatedly) on hardcore with a female one. My buffed summons did most of the fighting. I used the infinite dryad spawn point for ~15k cheat experience. Talk about a grind. Fortunately I could rew up Cheat Engine to x66 or something. The boring bit with casters is the constant resting to reload your spells.

All in all the Beamdog remake is a great opportunity for some childhood reminiscing. I remember buying a pirated copy on 3 CDs from a classmate in 2002 for 100 Estonian kroons (money that doesn't exist anymore). I'd like to see anyone beat that level of nostalgia.

Excellent implementation (if a bit incomplete) of the v3 D&D rules, but a bit overpowered in some cases (looking at you, clerics). If you're a fan of newer games, you'll probably struggle with the idiosyncrasies of the camera and movement.

Pros:
1 - Great story and replay value, especially with the sheer number of class combinations possible. Every time you play it can be a new experience with a different class, prestige class, and henchman.
2 - Editor to make your own modules and workshop content.
3 - Living world with multiplayer ""worlds"" you can join with dozens of other players to complete content (optional)

1 - Dated interface features and functionality

What makes NWN 1 so special is that you do not only have a fairly easy to control and play RPG, but you also have simple and straightforward tools that allow you to create your own mods. While the Aurora Toolset takes a bit to master, it is incredible what manner of content you are capable of creating once you master it. 

The downside is that, at the time of writing, NWN:EE suffers from some instability issues. An old game, that still needs some optimization, it is one of the best RPGs in terms of moddability. 

Oh, and the game, of course, supports the option of having Dungeon Masters, to not just play with your friends, but also DM for them, whether in the base campaign, or in your own or downloaded campaign.

So if you do not have the diamond edition (stay away if you do) this game is great. It will lead you through one of the best stories written in D&D, the story of a hero that surpasses their mentor and becomes instrumental to their salvation or damnation. 
Be warned this game is based on an absolute ruleset that governs the battle mechanics. though this is not a hard game making a powerful character sheet is one of its biggest allures and the main reason for its replay-ability.

I'd originally seen this game being played by my friend waaay back in elementary school. I thought it looked sooo cool, I'd really wanted to play it, but was unable to get it. Fast forward to my adulthood and I'm finally playing it, and OHHH LAWWWDDY!!! 

It was worth the wait honestly...I love it! I've only started doing the first campaign and cant wait to see the other content. 


Been binging this game since I bought it.
It's like a 3D version of Baldur's Gate, with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic mixed in. 

I only wish Neverwinter Nights 2 was on Steam! I had to buy it on GOG then add it to my steam, which STEAM IS SO POOPY THEY WONT EVEN SHOW MY SCREENSHOTS ON M THE STEAM ACTIVITY FEED UGH. 

Gameplay is great. 
Combat is good, really feels like a 3D BG/Kotor mix. 
Interesting story, I love the lore, and how everything in the Forgotten Realms universe connects, mentioning Baldur's Gate locations and characters etc. It's so delciiously immersive! Very Nerdgasmic. 

Controls a little different from most games, but whence getting the hang of it, you'll play with no issue. 

The writing is quite good. Dialogue is immersive and funny.
I've gotten some good chuckles and hearty laughs. The male gnome prostitute in the brothel made me fucking LOL. 

You can play the campaigns Online with friends, it's really sick!  
My friend and I are playing coop, both as Elf Mages, my char is Reganous Halfelven, a Conjurer and my friend is a Necromancer.  It's a blast so far!

Solo playing as a Half orc barbarian,Reganous Halforcen, using a Halberd, had recently remade my char, now dual wielding!! Having a blast.

There are mods directly supported by the creators, Beamdog, on the Workshop, so go grab those new weapon texture mods and other goodies, like the Companion AI/inventory mod.


The game is really quite fun, I highly recommend it!


Coming back to edit my review: 
From much binging of this game I've racked up several hundred hours, it's just that good! After doing the campaigns solo and co-op with friends,  I began playing persistent world multiplayer servers. 
 Unfortunately, most servers are mandatory Role Play, which I am not an RPer, but there are some which I found that are non-rp mandatory servers. 
The Starwars, A Dawn of Heroes, Winters LOTR Enhanced servers are really great, and spent much playtime on. 

I'd love for this game to get a remake with a fresh modern engine that would allow smoother, non-laggy, clunky issues to occur.  I think it would  be incredible with modern standards added to this already great game.

Edited review again: I've nominated this game for the steam awards!",1561759840,1574881761,True,16,2,0.637599587440490723,0,True,False,False

The game has the ability to let administrators on their servers work as a Dungeon Master, or DM, which gives them the ability to place tileset items, make enemies, and tell stories their way, just like the tabletop counterpart. There's even systems for rolling dice for checks when needed, and some automation to it as well if leveraged in the module, which can all be produced by the end user in the included toolset.

A) That is for the ""Enhanced Edition"" as the old game wasn't ON steam.
B) If you look at my GOG page where I had already bought the original Diamond Version of the game a long time ago, I have over 336 hours on it. That was BEFORE the Enchanced Edition by Beamdog came out.
C) I played this game a LOT as a kid (although I admittedly never bothered to count the hours, but I'll be generous and say that I played it for roughly the same length of time that I have played the Steam Version, no way that is even close to true it was inevitably WAY more but again, I'll be generous and round it down to there.)

SO, just to be clear, despite what my Steam Page says, I have ACTUALLY played this game for somewhere in the realm of 516+ Hours (90+90+336=516) so I have SOME measure of experience with which to talk about the game, and do have some legitimate grounds with which to compare and contrast this version of the game vs the Diamond ""Original"" on GOG, or the much older and much more... Original... Platinum Edition box from when this game was still new-""er"" roughly 18 years ago.

With that out of the way

The first thing to understand about this game should you seek to play it, is that if you are a veteran of RPG's looking for a challenge, this game will NOT meet you, it is piss easy and should be played on the highest possible difficulties at all times. This is partially due to how Neverwinter Nights handles difficulty.
They don't.
Well, that isn't fair, they DO but they do it in the laziest way it can be done, enemy health and damage gets tripled. This was perfectly serviceable back in the days when this game was still fresh but I feel an opportunity was missed for Beamdog to actually do something with the difficulty slider by updating enemy AI instead of merely updating the graphics to a slightly higher resolution, I am not a game developer so I don't know how realistic my expectations were I fully admit, but it DOES feel like they could have done more to bring some much needed challenge into the ""Enhanced"" portion of this Edition.
However there ARE a few other reasons to up the difficulty that is wholly unrelated to challenge and its something that has always bothered me a bit about the game.
The higher you crank the difficulty, the more the game mechanics start functioning like DND. On Normal Difficulty. NORMAL. DIFFICULTY. Enemies CANNOT Crit you AND do 50% LESS damage than intended, there is no Friendly Fire (So mages can Spam Fireball all damn day and never worry about hitting his meatshields) and all spells with an ""Instant Death"" effect or anything of the like AUTOMATICALLY fail when used against The Player. In addition Stuns, Dazes, and Paralyzes that DO hit the player have their duration reduced to 1/4th, and ""fear"" effects ONLY reduces a player's attack bonus and saving throws by 2, which admittedly, IS what the first stage of fear (shaken) does in the tabletop game, but not what it does to literally everything else affected by fear in THIS game.
That is the biggest reason that I recommend Cranking the Difficulty Slider ALL THE WAY UP for Veterans of CRPG's and RPGs in general: ""Normal"" Difficulty STILL massively handicaps your enemies by straight up EXEMPTING The Player from some of the most integral mechanics of the game. This is on top of AI that to this day STILL cannot outsmart a TI-82 Calculator with a switchblade stuck through its center. Make no mistake, Enemy AI is a joke, they never have a plan outside of ""Me melee, me run at you, me hit till you die"" or ""Me caster, me spend the first 12 rounds doing nothing but self buffing, me spam fireball"" unless its a fairy, then it gets even worse as those bastards are geniuses ""Me Fairy, me go invisible, me cast Entangle until your processor melts""
I'm not joking, you probably think I am, I'm not, Fairies do NOTHING except spam entangle at the same space the player is standing in, and these shitheels always attack in packs of 5-8. and with 8 fairies all invisible and casting entangle EVERY. SINGLE. ROUND. even on modern computers the Frame Rate WILL start to chug after the 14th casting. So if you have an older computer, kill those bastards quickly because I would not be surprised if they cause a crash. I haven't crashed because my PC is actually pretty damn good, but even it has chugged when stuck fighting these Nightmarish Processor Hunter-Killers from hell. They're a boring chore and not dangerous in the slightest, they just threaten to fuck up your computer by making things get really busy, really fast.

I had to vent about those things for a minute because they've only ever felt like they're in the game to annoy the shit out of you instead of being actually dangerous, which I guess is true to canon but some canonical aspects of Faerun just are not worth it guys.
So that shits still not fixed from the original game.
For those of you who don't care if the game is a cakewalk or not and just want a good story, well there is actually a reason for you guys to consider upping the difficulty as well.
Loot Drops and EXP
They're directly tied to your difficulty setting and the game never bothers to tell you this in any way. I only know this because I repeatedly tested it. Even the slider itself doesn't mention it. The higher your difficulty setting is, the more EXP and Better Quality of items you get at the end of each fight is. The better the chance you pull something useful out of a chest instead of another stack of 20 gold pieces. This testing is how on the highest possible difficulty I was able to pull an item with an Auto-Haste effect (Boots of Speed) out of a box in Chapter 2 of the Original Campaign (When such items usually do not appear until chapter 3 at the earliest) and immediately break what little balance there was in the game over my knee.
So even people who LIKE feeling overpowered may wish to play on the HIGHEST, POSSIBLE, DIFFICULTY. Because the game only really makes non-scripted treasure drops worth a damn on that difficulty.
That's right, it takes playing on what is supposed to be the hardest mode to make the shit you pull out of a chest get filed under something other than ""Health Potions"" and ""Vendor Trash""
I'm not saying ALL drops are useful, but I AM saying only on this difficulty do SOME of the NON-SCRIPTED drops start being good. You also get 1.5X more EXP so you level faster to compensate for increased enemy damage, not that this honestly matters when the game is already so damn easy. But it does matter in the sense that you can actually become overpowered FASTER than you otherwise would on a lower setting.

So now that I've spent 30 minutes ranting about bad AI and the Difficulty Slider allow me to get into whats GOOD with the game. After all, there is a reason why this game has taken over 500 hours of my life over the years. I could probably write a guide for the entire game for each class when we get right down to it. I only complain, because there are a lot of problems with the game I think the update had a chance to fix but chose not to, which is disappointing. So in the context of this review, consider me a praiser by exception and that what I do NOT mention is perfectly fine, and what I DO mention in a positive connotation is VERY well done and possibly the best bits of the game. But I'm running out of room because apparently there is a character limit on reviews so to sum up the GOOD bits

+The Story* (Except the original campaign)
+The almost endless creativity with character building
+Very Intuitive Core Gameplay Loop
+Dialogue is well done in *most* cases
One last negative though

So here it is.  I bought this game in the original box set years ago.  I was excited to find it again on Steam and bought it right away.  Its still as good as I remember it and I'm having a blast running through the story with multiple character builds.  I haven't had a chance to play any of the premium modules yet, but I'm excited about trying them out too.

Couple of minor setbacks, but I was able to figure them out.  For example: During graphic intense scenes with lots of action happening at once, the screen has a tendency to freeze and get choppy (and this is regardless of your video card).  The solution is to open the task manager and reset the priority of the nwn.main or nwn.exe to at least ""above average"".  Once I did that I found the majority of issues I was experiencing were solved.

I am hoping that Steam is able to resolve whatever happened with Bioware and offer NWN 2 through steam again, because I very much want to buy it here too.

Anyways, great game.  Story is a bit comic-bookish at the beginning, but game-play and run-through is still as I remember.

After playing Baldur's Gate + ToSC and Baldur's Gate II + ToB i was so excited to play this back in the day. I was very disappointed.
Now, with the Enhanced Edition, nothing's really changed, it's the same game aside from some graphics and optimisaitons.
A very limited game compared to the other forgotten realms games i've played BG1&2, Planescape, Icewind Dale. 
This enhanced edition is nice and everything, but it's still just a 1 character d&d 'adventure', which frankly, isn't very interesting so far. I'll admit i haven't gotten very far, i'm only on the 3rd district of the starting city, but i just can't find the will to play. I'm bored.

I'm sure that the online part of this is really good for people who have friends who want to play a D&D campaign together, and i have no doubt the Dungeon Master stuff is really good, but that's just not my thing.

After the truly epic stories of BG, Planescape, and the wonderful group combat of all the other games i mention here, bimbling about on 1 character with some random (really really really useless) ...tool.. to back me up that i can't even control is just a massive let-down, the writing is pretty basic as well. Conversation choices aren't much to interest either.

I imagine all the love for the game comes from people who got involved with the ""mmo-lite"" persistent worlds and DMing their own stories, cos i can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would love this game for the single player. 

I'm going to keep trying with it, maybe it gets better, maybe it engages me at some point. 
But really the 3d world gimmick is nowhere near as detailed or vibrant as the original Baldur's Gate 2d artistry, and it doesn't make up for much in the game in my opinion.

Apart from multiplayer support, the main advantage the EE has over the original is that it works well out of the box. Even in compatibility mode, the original can be a bit difficult on new systems. Modding is also more straightforward with the EE, although not all old mods seem to be compatible.

The post processing like sharpen and bloom make a big difference. I loaded up the original to compare and the EE looks much prettier although we're still talking about a game from 16 years ago.

The only issue I've run into is some odd frame rate drops in specific areas, but it seems Beamdog are working on this for the next patch. The UI Scaling could use some work as well. I'm playing at 1080p on a laptop, and the two interface options are either difficult to read or big and blurry.

I've wanted to and almost did order an old copy online, but part of me just didn't feel like paying 20 bucks for an old game. When I saw the ""Enhanced Edition"" on sale for about 7 bucks, I knew I had to finally give it a shot! I even sold a bunch of Steam cards and used them to buy some of the extra DLC add-ons.

However, I want this review to be for the base game and the stuff that comes with, so let's focus on that. Neverwinter Nights is an old-school CRPG in the vein of Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment. It takes place in the Neverwinter setting of Dungeons & Dragons and thrusts you into the role of a custom adventurer. The main story of the game is pretty bland, but I think most people know this already.

The main story is bare bones and basic and the entire first act consists of you running around a town and engaging in weird side-missions in order to capture a bunch of escaped monsters. Pretty dry stuff, if you ask me. It gets a little more complex and interesting later on, but I feel it's not really worth trudging through. What is worth trudging through is the additional content! You have three plug-ins and two full-on expansion packs, all of which have better stories and scenarios than the main quest.

The gameplay itself is pretty basic. You equip different weapons and armor, cast spells, and frequently pause your game to strategize. It's nothing too new or revolutionary, but it gets the job done. On top of the gameplay itself, you are showered in tons of options for both races and classes. In many ways, it feels like a MMO!

That's a good segway into the main appeal of this game: The online component. Neverwinter Nights was designed with being a smaller-scale MMO in mind, which allows for the player to create their own servers with their own game rules. Neverwinter Nights was one of the first games to encourage wide-scale mods and fan-made content, long before Bethesda ever did so with Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

Going online and joining all these random servers is probably some of the most fun I've ever had in an MMO. I met tons of people and even found some rare items online. Best of all, when I imported my online character into a single-player campaign I KEPT A BUNCH OF OP RARE ITEMS! NICE! Honestly, the online was immensely fun and made the game for me.

Now, I've gushed a lot about the game, but it's got problems. The graphics are rather bad and haven't aged well at all, being mostly unchanged since release. This doesn't bother me too much, since I'm used to most old RPGs from the time looking like garbage. It gives off an ""early World of Warcraft"" feel, and I dig it.

There's also the fact that the game doesn't bundle in all of the previously released plugins with the game. I get Darkness Over Daggerford and Tyrants of the Moonsea not being in there, but should all the other expansions not be included with the main release? These were plugins that have been available for a long time now and it's kind of unfair to sell them back to the player.

Also, there's a bit of a learning curve for people who are new to these kinds of RPGs. If you just pick any class/race combo and expect to be successful with it, then you're gonna have a bad time. There are also parts of the game that have not aged, especially some of the dialogue and voice-acting.

That being said, Neverwinter Nights has a magical charm to it. It's a game that evokes this strong sense of nostalgia, even if I never grew up playing it. I've only put 27 hours into this game so far, but I hope to get back into it soon and give it more of a shot. Just be warned that what you're getting is not a massive open-world action RPG like Skyrim or Fallout 4, but rather an old-school RPG adventure that's been updated to run better on modern computers. It's dated, somewhat janky, and lacking in a good main quest, but it gets the job done.",1571088407,1571088407,True,4,0,0.532115161418914795,0,True,False,False

Neverwinter Nights, I still have my CDs somewhere and the manuals and all that from when I bought this game like 20 years ago or whatever, and I've always thought of it as a very classic RPG with all the flexibility of the D&D system in a rather pretty package. I like the look of this game and all the effects and lighting still look okay. Obviously, the models are a bit lacking but all the textures look good to me.

I can't actually tell what they added with this version of the game, however. The store page claims something like, 1080p GUI and such? That's weird, because the original game seemed to handle 1080p just fine. Shaders? I didn't notice any. Game looks the same it always did to me. Maybe the added a sharpness filter? I have really no idea. In addition, I can safely say that the original game still works on Windows 7, and since I don't intend to upgrade to Windows 10, I've no need of this 'enhanced edition'. I at least appreciate the Linux port, I guess.

Anyway, the asking price of like $30 for this game just seems a bit much... I bought the diamond edition years back on GOG, and not only is that technically DRM free so you can play it LAN if you've got some friends willing to play the game, it's cheaper too. So that's my advice, go buy that one.

I don't really regret buying this game since it IS convenient to just have it here in my Steam library which is the platform I use most prominently, but still, I guess I'm just not too impressed with this version of Neverwinter Nights.",1570632702,1570632702,False,25,2,0.654761552810668945,0,True,False,False

This has resolved my problems with the game. I've now been able to play for at least an hour straight....

So for the new review: If you're anything like me, and you played this back in the day and you have fond memories of doing so. Then I'm sure you'll enjoy playing this again for the nostalgia. Gameplay wise, i guess the interface is as quirky as I remember it,  the camera management kind of works, the graphics is of course dated but that is to be expected. As with amost all old-school RPG it means the inventory management is awful. Also, if you are not familiar with older RPGs you maybe a little bit overwhelmed with all the special game mechanics.

That said, I would recommend this if you like this kind of games!

The online communities are; however, absolutely fantastic. There's servers with 100+ players online at a time, and a sea of well-written, well-considered characters running about telling stories. Many of the under the hood changes made by the Enhanced Edition are really only beginning to be taken advantage of in online communities.

I've poured 1000's of hours into it and my last session was just a week ago. I still play it despite its age! If you missed out on this wonderful game, let me cue you in on why it's managed to hold my interest for so long.

The game is based on a modified D&D 3.5 ruleset. If you don't know what that means, it doesn't matter. The important bit is that there is a complex, awesome system behind leveling your character. You can actually spend hours designing a character that gets the best of two worlds, while sacrificing other facets.

While having that ruleset is cool, the original developers of Neverwinter Nights only went so far with it. They did a wonderful job, but it takes true fans, and a lot of time, to push that envelope even further. This is where Neverwinter Nights truly shines. It has an editor that allows people to make custom content. This means new classes, new abilities, new gameplay mechanics, and new enemies that utilize all of the aforementioned things. There are tons of mods that use the base game mechanics, but there is also a fair amount of mods that will expand upon them much, much further or change them competely.

So, it is my recommendation that if you plan on playing this game, then do not focus on the main campaign that comes with it. It is fun, and I've played it a couple times through, but the ultimate satisfaction, and especially for hardcore gamers that want a real challenge, is to play custom mods made by the community. I'd even go as far to say that skipping the Bioware-made campaigns altogether is the best way to play this game, even for a newcomer. Instead, you should go into multiplayer, and either play a custom mod with friends, or find a server with an interesting mod for you to play on.

The game has been around for ages, and the amount of mods that have piled, even ones that are cooperative and/or MMO-style, is astounding. Just find ""The Neverwinter Vault"" on Google to see. Mods such as Soul Shaker can provide a group of cooperatively playing buddies an entirely new take on the base games' systems. Demon is a super interesting singleplayer mod that has a trading card battle game built right into it. Persistent worlds (i.e. servers hosted in MMO-style) such as the one hosted and actively updated by the Higher Grounds team (Google ""Higher Grounds NWN"") take the game and expand upon it so much that it becomes hard to design a party that can conquer the immense difficulty that they have set forth.

I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys playing RPGs with friends, and while the casual MMORPG player may not be satisfied with it due to its lacking graphics, hard-to-master mechanics, and general clunkiness (due to age), I think it is an RPG that some such players will get a huge amount of entertainment off of.


EDIT: Please note that the aforementioned Higher Grounds server isn't using Neverwinter Nights Enhanced and so you cannot connect to it at the time of writing (they plan to switch). Additionally, there seems to be a consensus that the enhanced edition should be marked early access until it is feature-complete and bug-free. For these reasons, it might be better to buy the Diamond edition off of the GOG website.",1522176738,1566567354,True,37,1,0.669254004955291748,1,True,False,False

Aribeth COULD do something about it, she's really high up there in the government and she does nothing. Then she spends the next chapters crying about her poor Fen, for no reason I could understand.

I thought that maybe I would have changed my mind from having played during its original release.  Sadly - my mind has not changed.

The single player mode is terrible.  

- Character creation is a mess.  Making literally the same character in Icewind Dale 2 takes less than half the time.

- The UI is clunky, accessing skills though the ""wheel"" pop up in game is slow and frustrating to navigate.

- Tedious training area at the start, where the major difficulty at all is getting the UI to behave itself.

- Porn movie quality writing form the start.  I was waiting for the credits to show it had been written by the masterful Max Hardcore rather than anyone involved in Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale.

- Being able to only have one, completely straight-jacketed companion who is led by laughably bad AI not only distracts from the feeling of a grand adventure, but its also infuriating when they're either running off on their own dying or leaving you to fend for yourself.  

- The system of only really having one full-fledged character hurts some classes badly and significantly encourages others.  This is exasperated by the fact your companion is little more than a guest NPC who has little to no personality, no reason to be there and ultimately doesn't really give you the experience of any real synergy between you and them in combat.  Left field comparison would be when you had Natalya with you in the N64 game, ""Goldeneye"" and how infuriating that was.

And then there are the bugs and crashes.  Because they're still there, many, many years later.

- Random slow downs
- Freezing and sudden program closures
- Scripting errors that sometimes mean NPCs just... stand there... and do nothing when they should be taking part in a cut scene.  Or worse, when you're fighting.
- Awful collision detection when you're walking around.  Also - your character is apparently made of glue and likes to stick to things like corners.

This all makes me sad, because honestly - Beamdog have done an excellent job on Baldurs Gate I&II and Icewind Dale I.  I even thoroughly enjoy Siege of Dragonspear.

Given the last update to toolset, I'm changing this review to positive. Although i still can't justify spending $20 for the lack of features, even now, given the fact that they are still actively updating things and improving user experience has changed my stance on the developers as a whole. I think that for anyone returning to the series, this might be a reasonable purchase for you if you feel like returning for some nostalgia.

THAT BEING SAID.

Don't let phrasing fool you. This is an *enhanced edition*, not any sort of remake, remaster, or overhaul. A number of bug fixes have been made, and the game has been updated for modern systems.

This is why I give this product a negative review, if you have a dedicated server with a static IP, you're good and set, you can join the multiple RP servers out there. BUT if you want to host a game to play a module or a campaign with friends? Good luck!
Direct connect and UDP hole punching has failed - is what you'll see for no reason the devs can explain.

NWN 1 is one of the best RPGs of all time. It still has a very active and vibrant community 17 years on. 

EE added some nice features, particularly graphical and quality of life multiplayer server support (which I find excellent) and is apparently still backwards compatible with everything including save games (which I can't test). 

In terms of the bad reputation RE crashes, I did have a large number of crashes playing through the Aielund Saga (a popular user made series of 6 single player modules, which is available for free), it was still playable but I would save my game very often. 

I had concerns playing multiplayer with the amount it crashed during Aielund, however I'm playing through the World of Greyhawk persistent world right now (which I have found a very challenging but rewarding environment) and it is super stable. I'm sure I've clocked up about 100 hours on that server now (wow!), and there was only one crash. Loading times are super fast. 

My conclusion is the crashes have something to do with the module design but I'm not 100% sure of this.

I'd definitely get NWN EE if its on sale. If its not on sale you have a lot of choices RE games. This would still not be a bad choice if you can't wait to get into it.

Aielund, Sword flight, Aribeth's Redemption, Sands of Fate) and persistent worlds before you make a decision to buy DLC, the fan made content is completely free and simply amazing.

The official bioware compaigns (OC, SoU and HoTU) only go up to level 28, only taking advantage of maybe half to two thirds the features possible with the tools available to them (spells like Epic Warding and Dragon Shape are usually taken pretty late in the epic levels), and the fan made content right now is probably the best way to access this content.",1562542551,1563179085,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just want to point out (mostly to naysayers):

THIS IS NOT AN RPG.

This is an RPG SIMULATOR.

It was designed to create and play AD&D modules.  The modules presented (NWN and 
subsequent content) were created and polished to show how much could be done. The
only reason it is still popular is because it's possible to go in with virtually no programming
experience and create something you can play without grinding out LUA or similar
scripting language routines.  Yet it also allows expansion to the nth degree by dedicated
enthusiasts (within the scope of the engine)

The enhanced version basically makes it bearable to play on modern machines, fixes the
server problems for hosting and improves the tool set for building modules.  

I agree with most naysayers in that:

1. The UI is archaic - though not unusable.
2. The included stories are too convoluted for the abilities of the infinity engine.
3. The graphics are never going to be anything but dated.
4. The D&D system as presented is limited.

So in the end, if you want to play a computer RPG, you should probably go
play WoW, PoE, Skyrim, or the like. 

If you want to play a game that feels more like a table top game, this is it.
It's a limited multiplayer Baldur's Gate mixed with some Goldbox games with
an option to create additional content.  This last is being the most important.

Yes, people are saying this game is outdated but it really has not been surpassed in many areas. One of which is the ability to have multiple characters that you can pick up and play at any time, then transfer those same characters to other modules and worlds. So, you could play the main campaign complete it and then transfer your character to a whole new adventure, you don’t even have to complete it just save that same character and there. There is also so many custom modules out there that it is just amazing. If only more games had this level of customisation!
You may think I am just being nostalgic, a dismissive argument made against anyone who prefers something old over something new, though this is not the case as I started playing this game back in 2009.

Still after 100+ hours into this game on GoG, I haven't discovered everything and there are still premium modules from Bioware I haven't even touched yet + there are community modules that are even larger and better made than the original expansions or premium modules. It is crazy. Even this first month, people have already submitted enough modules in the Steam Workshop that if you want to play the good ones + premium modules + expansions + the base games, you could easily put 300-400-1000? hours into this game. And those are hours and hours of quality storytelling, not some run & fetch quests! 

This game is not easy, nor it is very difficult. It is also based on a lesser used d&d ruleset: the 3.0 version. If you don't know these rules, the game can become difficult, since it may be that you don't know what you're doing. The 3.0 ruleset was a shortlived ruleset was updated into the extremely well known 3.5 ruleset, which currently lives on today in Pathfinder and Starfinder. The 3.0 ruleset has different skills, classes' special abilities and level-based unlocks are different then in the 3.5. It's not a huge difference. But the wizard familiars and spell specialisation is completely different. 

The skillset in neverwinter nights is not really any version of d&d. Since 3.0 and NWN was developed simultaneously, Bioware altered some skills and made them more efficient for a computergame. Such as swimming and climbing, also roleplay-skills are not added, f.e. reading lips (which doesn't excist in 3.5) or Inuit (which is  the survival check in later d&d versions),...  Riding was added in the latest patch nwn received back in the day. So don't bother levelling the riding skill when you are playing the main game, since you won't find any mounts.

CHARACTER CREATION

The fun thing about this game, maybe the most fun thing, is character progression. 3.0 and 3.5 are still the most technical crunchy D&D versions were you really could customize your character in any way possible. Character creation and levelling is not for the faint of heart. Without knowledge of the original RPG it can become quite difficult. Especially in the beginning. 

When building your char you can also chose to use the recommended button. And it can be a wise choice, except when chosing a class in character creation. That is the only moment where you shouldn't use the recommendation button. It will choose for fighter, I think, and that is the most boring class to play in this game. Otherwise, if you have chosen a different class and want to use the recommendation button afterwards, it will chose the most common options and the ones easiest to use for beginners. It also keeps in mind your previous choices. So if you have chosen to be a wizard, the recomendation button will know.

The cool thing is, that the prestige classes are also included in this game. After a certain criteria is fulfilled in your character build, this will be after leveling up a couple of times, you can choose to multiclass into a prestige class. For example you can become an epic shapeshifter druid, or a red dragon disciple. You will develop wings and dragonfire breath and have dragonskinn armor as spells. Pretty cool.

COMBAT

Combat is for some people very confusing. The game doesn't really explain what's going on behind the scenes, I think in the boxed version of the game it was explained in the manual, but it's not explained ingame. So for people who don't know D&D, which is rare, since 5.0 is extremely popular, I'm going to explain combat in D&D in short. Keep in mind, this game is a real-time turnbased game, so every character will do an action when it is his turn.

At the start of combat, all combatants who engage into combat will receive an initiative number. They will roll this randomly with a 20 sided die + their initiative modifier, which consists of their dexterty + bonusses from feats. The highest number can act first in combat. Then when everybody has received their turn, the first one can do a move action and a normal action. Or do a double move action. This game is realtime turnbased, so this you won't notice at first. But say, you are first in the initiative round. You have a speed of 30 feet (human) and you run 60 feet toward the enemy. The enemy can run 30 feet towards you and then still hit you first even when he is later in the combat initiative. So keep in mind, sometimes it is better to let the enemy run towards you.

To hit someone you have to roll for attack. This is d20 + BAB (basse attack bonus, a number according to class & level) + the attack modifier of your weapon + feats + bonuses. The attack modifier of your weapon can be your strenght or dexterity modifier. Finesse feat and ranged weapons use the dexterity modifier. So keep this in mind while building your character. So you generate this number, how high does it have to be? It has to be the same or higher than the AC of the enemy you want to hit. 

AC? Armor class. AC is the following formula: 10 + Armor + shield + dodge (feat / spells) + natural armors bonus (feats / spells) + deflection (feat / spells) + dexterity (up to a maximum number according to the armor you are wearing).

You have hit the enemy, how much damage? Then you roll the die roll specified to a weapon. Lets say a greater longsword does 1d8 damage. So this can be a number between 1 (!!!) and 8. So even after all this, it can still be for nothing. But after a while you will find better weapons that can do extra damage, for example a greater longsword +1. This will do 1d8+1 damage.

Spells have their own specified rules. Just read the spell description to understand them.

In D&D you can do many extra actions in combat. The only one I know of that is included in NWN is the bonus action known as the attack of opportunity. A Bonus action is an action you can do only one time per round. So after the last one in the initiative order has done his turn, you regain a bonus action. So, when an enemy runs away from you OR passes you, then you get a free instant attack. This will be notified to the player above his head with the text: ""attack of opportunity"". This is a normal attack.

STORY and GRAPHICS

The storytelling in this game is the traditional oldschool text-based conversations, the most important onces are voice-acted. Which is pretty cool. The presentation is for some people not pretty. It is one of the first real 3D isometric games and it doesn't look very good. Even the enhanced edition doesn't really look good, BUT they are still working on it. To be honest, I downloaded some community made modules just to test a few things, and even the old ones look better than the official modules.

The official modules, most of them or even all (?), are set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. Which is the most popular roleplaying setting since the eighties. Back then, it was not the main D&D setting, that was Greyhawk, but it was the most build and thought-out setting out there. And you will notice it while playing this game, this setting is HUGE and the community can create endless new stories in this setting. It is awesome.

ENHANCED EDITION?

The enhanced edition is not finished yet. So expect more changes in the future. Do I recommend it now? Well I recommend it to anyone who just wants a easy experience: steam cloud-saves, easy to instal community mods and modules, easy multiplayer and optimalisation for modern pc's. With the GOG version I haven't really bothered with searching for modules and back in 2002-2004 I didn't have an internet connection at home so I missed a huge part of the game.

I think with the enhanced edition, this can become a very nice new feel to an very oldschool RPG experience. With easy to install workshop creations from steam. This game has endless possibilities, and the fanbase is enormous. Even now the content released is enough for hundreds of hours of gameplay, even without replaying the game once.

1. The graphics were revolutionary for it's time and will work on even low powered gaming machines and yet provide wonderful 3D detail of the landscapes and buildings.
2. The story line and choices you get to make are extremely flexible and provide many opportunities for replay
3. The skills and special skills are excellent and provide great flexibility in choosing one or multiple skills to make you an asset in battle
4. Battle is fast paced and it requires that you become accustomed to shortcut keys and making strategic decisions to win. Remember to pause the battle to help you make the decisions can mean life or death, win or defeat. 
5. D&D rules, if you are a nerd, who doesn't love D&D inspired gaming although sometimes the math can really screw you over in battle.

To be honest, at the time of this review was initially written (2018) , nothing has been ""enhanced"" ever really. No new campaign, no new textures. This new version guarantees that you will be able to play multiplayer and the textures will look ok in 1920 resolution and beyond, but the same way they did on your CRT monitor back then.

This game is a piece of my adolescence. I am no hardcore D&D player, but I think I played this game around 2002 to 2008. It was that good.

Dear BeamDog , if you can read this , please make a 40-80 hour campaign. A campaign where we can reach up to level cap. An awesome dukeout with a boss. 

As a simple man , It still looks and feels the same. I'm not expecting witcher3 or skyrim graphics , but all of the patches are multiplayer oriented. so please, give us a campaign. I dont mind paying $40-$50 bucks for it as DLC. Using your own words ""The engine is already there"".

You can play the campaigns with friends, though I don't know if there's a cap on how many.
The servers are back, so you can play online once more. (There are quite a few well populated ones, as well.)

Compared to classic NWN Diamond Edition:
Overall less stability,
Increased lag during game-play. 
Premium Modules are no longer included, they are now DLC. (But are also portable, if you still own a copy of NWN:DE)
Tilesets have noticeably better aesthetics.
Editor has mild give-and-take improvements to functionality.

What's with them Character Portrait DLCs tho? $2.50/£2.09 to put a JPEG in a folder, like, for reals? Sure, nice artwork, but I think using them as a portrait for a fictional character in a non-profit game may also be considered fair use if someone liked them enough to side-step the pay-gate. 
Still, more money means a better game, I suppose.

Honestly, somewhat frustrating to play due to the stability and frame rate issues, it worked fine in 2002 but seems to be struggling a bit more now. Still one of my favourite games, and I'm still glad to own a copy on steam (I have so many discs! most of which are scratched due to reckless youth and shortsightedness).
Beamdog is partially owned by a co-founder of Bioware, and so I have absolute faith in their ability to do this game the justice it deserves eventually, but at the moment - I'd recommend buying it, perhaps on sale, and waiting for the updates to reconcile the innovations before playing, lest save lots, save often and remember to breathe - or risk bursting into TYRs, punching a paladin and screaming 'CYRIC TAKE YOU!' in the middle of the night.

SO, with that, I will say this one simple thing: JOIN UP! If you like roleplay, JOIN!

Pros

- Roleplay
- DnD style
- retro graphics
- great music
- Moddable
- Amazing community (mature, fun roleplay, friendly)
- Great mechanics (very different, pretty complex at times, includes automated DnD dice rolling)


Cons

- Small Community
- Dated graphics
- Kind of hard to understand
- Can be grindy, if you're lazy and don't like to work for your pay
- Story can be boring alone (get friends!)

Long term player I helped create a lot of the lore in the game for the elven race. I was first leader of the elf city Myon. I took a decade break and decided to come back and see how arelith was doing. 

I found much of lore gone and several of the cities destroyed or changed so drastically I barely recognized them. The server has changed hands while I was absent and it seems the new runners have added a lot of automation like a voting system. The system allows players to vote for leaders in each city. This sounded like a great idea when I first heard about it. However under closer inspection I found voting system is badly abused. The largest group of players has created alt characters for each city  and ensures they always hold the role of leader in each city.

I noticed this in practice as the cities are all but abandoned until election day each month then the army of alts logs on to vote for one of the buddies in the alt army as leader. They will log in alternate character in each city and use this tactic to control everything. Due to the pure automation of the system no amount of conflict will change the leadership roles only buying more NWN keys and out voting them is the only recourse.I found this very silly for a server that prided itself on role playing to allow such a system to completely circumvent all role playing and award the people with the most accounts authority.",1558313099,1558313163,False,10,6,0.243074283003807068,0,True,False,False

So I saw kikoskia do a let's play of this game, and thought it looked fun. I did not play it when it first came out, I only recently started playing it. I didn't go out of my way to get it, but recently it was on sale for 6 dollars and I said why not? It is a dnd based game, so everything is done by rolls. I would say the story isn't as good as baldur's gate, but its alright, and there are some nice ui improvements. I won't review the game itself as such much more than that since such reviews are widely available. Its fun, if you like dnd rpgs then you will probably like this game.

The biggest issue I had is that frequently, maybe every half an hour to an hour, the game would get really bogged down and ""lag."" And I am talking about single player offline, not online. Especially when spells were cast that had enduring graphics, especially the japanese porn/horror ground tentacle stuff. The game wouldn't freeze (except 1 or 2 times out of 50) It would just get really slow and unresponsive. Though waiting ten seconds would let the command go through. Winning a fight in that state wasn't usually possible, so I would either save or since I frequently make saves just revert to the previous one after closing the application and restarting it. On a restart it would usually work fine. That suggests it isn't my hardware settings, I have a nividia geforce 1050 and that should be more than enough to run a 15 year old game. The game just gets in a funk, and you have to restart it. Then it works fine for a while. This is probably related to the unplayability talked about in other  reviews. However, I viewed this more as an inconvenience since the game did play with this adjustment. That said, beamdog is trying to sell this product as compatible with modern systems and they should first and foremost make sure issues like this aren't present. Still, it was an inconvenience and for 6 dollars its not a problem for me. I wouldn't spend 20 given this issue, but for 6 I will live it.

I have had a lot of fun playing a rogue sorcerer. Rogue because dnd has a real hard*&on for traps and locked chests. Having some rogue levels lets you navigate that and also lets you pick someone other than the thief (tomi undergallows) as your henchman. I used those levels to up lockpick, spot trap, disable trap, and tumble. Tumble especially is useful as a sorcerer because you don't ever want to be in melee, and avoiding opportunity attacks is super useful for when you are running away like a little ...... For the rogue levels, I also chose feats focusing on heavy crossbows for the same reason. Even if you love tomi, one level of rogue is super worth it for the sneak attack feat. Since the mooks were usually fighting daelian the fighter and my fairy dragon familiar, that is an automatic sneak attack. Usually between 15-25 damage per hit. Since I was using a heavy crossbow the threat level was high, and the bad ai would temporarily move to attack me giving both the previous opportunity attacks. By the end of the first chapter you can easily afford elemental bolts which boost the damage even more. Fine Goodmane is quite the damage dealer even for physical combat. Rogue and sorcerer are quite a nice combo if you have a fighter/cleric/monk front line.  

If the game is on sale, its worth it. Full price isn't worth it unless they fix the stability issues.",1555691085,1555691137,True,6,1,0.558383703231811523,0,True,False,False

I bought the platinum version back in the day and after about three months my discs stopped working. I put it down and never picked it up again. And then I discovered Steam!

This game is obviously not new, and obviously the graphics leave a little to be desired.
But, it's D&D that you can play by yourself! If your an anti social RPG nut like me, this is a great thing.

If you can get passed the ""lego"" graphics in 2019, and a sometimes awkward control scheme, then this is a great way to lose hours (or days) questing, looting, and immersing yourself in the Forgotten Realms.

Multi player is fun, but the online community is basically a ghost town compared to what it was fifteen years ago. Not surprised, considering the game is fifteen years old.

The game is objectively non-functional for many people. Of small a group who all picked up it up we all eventually got it running. Once. After quitting the game after playing for a short while nobody can get it to run and we're running out of time to troubleshoot in order to still get a refund so we've given up.

For me personally:

On launching after the issues started I first was having the game just not render sections of the screen once a game save was loaded. This made the game unplayable as this included around 50% of the total area. Some fiddling around revealed the whole game was effectively rendering way off center once the save file loaded (menus were fine) and at a reduced resolution compared to what the settings menu claimed.

The obvious thing to try was restarting the system, reset settings and try again like previously. Didn't help. Next step is to unplug extra monitors etc and see if they were messing with it. This made it worse somehow as now the game simply renders a black screen and plays sound as though everything is fine. Reinstalling did not fix the issue either so I'm guessing that the forcing the game to work once was a fluke and it is generally just not something that will work reliably.

It's a shame as there's a decent game here, especially for those like myself who heard great things about the game but never picked it up in the past. You'll likely never see that game through this version as the 'enhanced' edition is plagued with bugs/issues that stop you very early on. For those looking for similar games that work pretty well, some more recent games to go look at are Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity. Preferred 1 over 2 for the latter personally.

I first played this game back in the Windows XP days. The game was super fun, the servers were a blast, and the modding via the included Aurora Toolset was AWESOME. I absolutely LOVED making my own game modules for my friends and I to play. Many good times were had in those days. 

Fast forward to today, with modern hardware, and no more Windows XP. Beamdog has graciously taken this game and made it run on modern hardware and OS's (Windows, Linux, Mac). The servers are back, and this Enhanced Edition comes with the toolset so we can still make our own games. Yay! 

This game is absolutely still worth buying today, even if you still own the original game CDs (as I do). It all plays just like it did back in the day. I can't tell that I'm not using WinXP on then-current hardware. And this is even more impressive, since I'm playing this on Linux (Mint 19.1). The OS and hardware support is *flawless*. It was plug & play, nothing to mess with, no errors, no frame drops, no weirdness. Of course, Steam games are supposed to be this easy, it's the whole point. But sometimes things don't go well in the porting process to Linux, so it's always nice when something Just Works. And this game does.

The only bummer about this game is that unfortunately the Aurora Toolset is still not Linux-compatible. In trying to find a way to run it in Linux, I have found that the reason it can't be ported is that Bioware originally wrote it in C++. In order for Beamdog to make it run in Linux, they would have to basically re-write the entire thing from scratch (their words, on their website & forums), and being a small team, this is prohibitively difficult. So they aren't going to do it. So, any Linux users who want to make mods and DM their own games, you will still need Windows for that part. I'm sorry.  :-(  But hey, the game itself is native and you can still play the servers in Linux, so it's still a win in my book.

10/10 would buy again!

A nostalgia trip of great proportions.
And Beamdog does not fail to deliver.

Just being able to play online is worth the asking price alone. But they took my old game refreshed it, make it work seamlessly on my system and brought back my childhood.

I have the original CD's. I have GOG's version and I also have Beamdog's version. And out of the 3 Beamdog's version runs the best.
A few quality of life improvement, steam workshop support. And slowly the community is moving here contributes to a great buy.

Now you might say, but only 24 hours played. That is nothing. And you would be correct. But I am not young anymore I don't have as much time to play as I used to. But in a few years, the hours will add up.

According to GOG, I have 216 hours played.
And according to Xfire (does not exist anymore), I had over 4000 hours (give or take a few hundred) in the original CD's.

I know for some full price is a hard bargain. But do know this game + all its DLC goes on sale quite often.
During winter sale I got it + all DLC for 70% off.

I highly recommend this game. There are not many turn-based RPGs and none released after Neverwinter Nights 1 has been good enough.

This remains- with expansions and a few modules bundled- the same game it was in 2002, and a stepping stone in the evolution of the isometric RPG. 

This will put some people off- to them, I would recommend skipping the original game and heading straight for the expansions and modules, as they incorporate more modern touches while not changing the overall feel of the game. 

The main benefit, to me, is the convenience of having a readily accessible version of the game without the need for CD keys or even taking the CD's out of the aforementioned boxes.

Don't waste your money on this overpriced mess of a game. Even if you played it before and want a bit of a nostalgia trip, don't buy it, because the port sucks, it somehow managed to still have crashing issues and further technical problems, even in the short time I tried it.

That being said, this enhanced edition is hardly enhanced... the game was ugly when it was released and it still is very much so - though not much they could've done bar from a complete rework on the game engine.

Apart from the obvious horrible polygon models, I've encountered some annoyances:
- Main character drops his attack command every now and then, while enemies are whacking away at you, requiring you to reissue the command
- Companions follow instructions very loosely - for example setting the cleric companion to heal you at 75%/50%/25% hp might make her heal you under the instructed percentage or she might just keep power attacking enemies, stay very close to me might mean couple of screens away so you need to stop [strike]drop and roll[/strike] and wait her to catch up/issue a follow me command
- Fighting on doorways might cause involved parties to think their enemies are out of LOS, meaning everyone stops fighting
- You can't directly control companions and their actions or movements, meaning they will become a pokemon master with floor traps and they will try to catch em all (though Beamdog has made a query if the playerbase would like to be able to control companions directly so it might get implemented at some point)
- Sometimes you are allowed to rest on the dungeon while you can't see enemies anywhere, sometimes not

Though those are really minor things in my mind compared to what you'll get.
- The game is still wonderful rendition 3rd edition D&D rules
- Incredible amount of user made mods, story modules etc
- Good dungeon master tools to run campaigns online

Definitely recommending the game. Though if you are split up between Beamdog's enhanced editions for single player game, I would recommend getting the Bhaal saga instead of this.

The user interface problems are completely unacceptable at this point (the inability to click on inventory items or even the ground at times), the poor frame rates when zooming out, and the bland looking text during interactions.

7/10

Positives
- Very in depth DnD ruleset that lends itself well for the most part to a role playing game
- Huge variance in playstyle based on what class you choose
- Many different enemy types though the most interesting are rare
- Good but not great story for the original campaign
- HUGE amount of downloadable, player made content available
- two expansions included, however they are a seperate story from the OC, meaning a new character is made.
- Hordes of the Underdark containing huge dungeons and using some of the latest level abilities in DnD. Is chalk full of character
- Shadows of the Undrentide I found to be somewhat lacking in comparison to both Hordes of the Underdark and the original campaign but none the less was still a fun adventure
- Enourmously charming character in Deekin the bard kobold

Negatives
- Very repetitive environments 
- Structure of the OC is also repetitive (glorified fetch quests)
- Limiting party structure in comparison to similar DnD games 
- Combat can feel random and unfair in the early levels

Additional Comments

- Runs well but framerate drop can occur when encountering a rare specific type of creature in game
- Cannot emphasize the amount of content received from this purchase enough

Which could be easily remedied by closing the game and restarting it which takes no time at all. Although a big problem is the inventory and companion A.I. The items in your inventory will randomly freeze and the cursor will stop working when trying to move or sell them to a vendor, even during combat the items can freeze in place and refuse to be moved. The only solution I found to that is keeping items off the first and second tab of the inventory. Companions often freeze in place instead of helping you in the fight, which never happened in the original realease of the game. This game works, though just not very well. I definitely won't be opening again until all these problems are patched properly.

Followers would usually get out of your way with the point and click style of movement but I find myself using the manual keyboard movement to walk through followers quite often in this release. I don't ever want to use ""tank controls"" in this game.
There seems to be way more slowdown/FPS dips compared to the original release despite the meager visual enhancements.

Still one of my favorite games despite the minimal enhancements Beamdog has put on top of it.",1546833103,1546833206,True,6,0,0.562965810298919678,0,True,False,False

You have done  poor job at improving NWN.  I played the first offering when it came out, the very first time.  If an enhancement is all you have to offer, then the gamesystem is not worth it.

It seems that many of the Titlesets, Placeables with numerous others have been lost, once seen in the NWN Vault of Hasbro.  The Wizards of the West Coast nearly ruined the following of NWN with NWN II.  I stopped playing because of their efforts.

I had several Independent Modules, online and always hundreds of players, all telling me they loved my Modules.  I gave them Story but disallowed most PVP Play.   Some Players do not like PVP because they came to PLAY and ENJOY the Gameplay. I banned those whom attacked other PLAYERS.  I had AREAs to put them, after being Warned not to ATTACK other PLAYERS.  Many of these were RUDE, ARROGANT and STUPID Males whom used disrespectful Languge toward me.  I am a Woam but I am not a Female Dog... if you know what I mean by that.

Since my return to Playing, I have encountred oo many ""Crashes"" while I play.  This is very discouraging and must be addressed.  The program won't even load my New EPIC MODULES, being created now.  I do not make PLAYERS start with New Characters, but use any they have developed, for their Playing enjoyment.

My work as a Motion Picture Screenwriter and Director keeps me busy but during the off months, I play as a single player, in the Privacy of my Home Office.  My newest Company is EEG and we are developing improvements in MODULE BUILDING.  A far greater diversity of all elements with Dragon Rider characters, Transportation systems, the ABILITY to Swim and many other elements not seen, in NWN before.  Greater Items and New, more verital Tilesets.  It is a lot of work and I do not care about PROFIT.  It is the Playing of the Game not Profit.  Maybe that is what is wrong in the Gaming World and I refuse to be a PROFITEER, at the expanse of those not as Financialy secure as I am.  I relx with my Game Playing, not to COMPETE for useless accolades and a Reputation.  The Fun is in Playing not competing.  Those whom want PVP are provided with ARENAs to Fight each others.  Non-PVP Players become SPECTATORS but can not be attacked.  It is the act of Voureism and if that is what others seek, then so be it.

I suggest you work on the Crashes first, before you lose your following and do another worthless effort at making NWN better?  It is just a suggestion, only.

Lastly, I have tried to download certain TILESETS and never found those available.  Solve problems not just write about it.  

Thank you.

704450,48099208,76561198194289627,0,50,4162,0,3154,1610488395,"i bought this edition of the game after first getting the Android version on sale for a single buck. The game intrigued me but the controls on Android were too wonky/unreliable, so i got the Steam version on sale (and the two are savegame-compatible, so i didn't lose any progress).

Wow. 50-odd hours into this i'm just now starting chapter 4 (of 5), and there's easily another 50+ hours in the supplied DLC content, not counting any 3rd-party modules available separately. My older PC can't handle the fullly-decked-out graphics detail, so it has to be dialed back to ""fast"" mode, as opposed to ""detailed"" mode, but the game is still completely enjoyable. i've come to prefer this game's single-character format over the party-based format of the Baldur's Gate series.

Cons:
- Flaky pathfinding, especially for henchpersons (who sometimes get caught on the edge of a doorway).
- Particularly annoying is when a henchperson or a docile deer(!) blocks the way when trying to move through a door. In such cases possible to force them to move out of the way by using the keyboard for movement, but the mouse-based movement doesn't do the job.
- Braindead henchpersons who keep getting killed by running off halfway across the map to fight everyone and everything themselves, despite being explicitely told to ""stay close"". Though i needed a henchperson to open chests for me early-game, i eventually abandoned them in Chapter 3 because babysitting them gets annoying as hell.
- ... that's really about it.

Pros:
- Runs flawlessly on Linux. Not a single crash or similar weirdness.
- There's lots and lots to do, much of it optional, so the player can more or less pick their own pace. (i went through most, but not all, of the side-quests.)
- An in-game command console allows you to ""cheat"" all you want, giving yourself XP, gold, individual items (if you can find a list of the item IDs), respect the character, or even making the PC invincible (because the Baalor Lord fatally sucked me through an Implosion spell 3 times in a row without that).
- The replay value, in the form of various character builds, is obviously high.

Multiplayer? yes, and full servers to boot, many years later.  This steam release makes it even better-easier to connect.
Singleplayer? Yes. I like the original stories, and you have many player built stories to boot!
RPG? This is the classic, turn based actions game, fluid so you don't feel the pain like ""Divinity"" has.  In single player you can pause like Divinity, or just let it rock and roll.
Story? Yes, I enjoy all the stories, and plenty of ""Modded"" Player made stories to boot.
MOD Tools? YES. Build your own adventure to share with us or your friends.
Hack and Slash? Up to you, you can build your own, log in to an MMO style server, or play how you want, or download an adventure. Ultimate Freedom.
DnD? You probably already own this....lol.
Recreate any game?  You can build any RPG with the tools, KOTOR, etc....Your own world that you can host!
Dungeon Master? YES. You can lead anyone through your special epic campain that you want. Your imagination is the limit?
Deep Character building?  Oh hell yes. Make yourself a trial arena and test your builds at any level.  I am actually addicted to Char building and testing.  Metagaming if you will.
Pets? Yep, your summons are awsome in this game.
Workshop? Yep. Nuff Said.

Everything is awsome about this game, except the following.
Graphics? Suck, but I don't care about it.  Good nuff for me.
Weird bugs? Yep.  I get weird graphical anomalies all the time.
UI?  Slow, but I can deal with the dated UI stuff.

I own several copies of the game, even on GOG.  But I am excited for this version, because of workshop support, access to premium modules that I haven't played yet or for a while, and easy server connections.  Just DO IT and log in to a multiplayer server and enjoy the greatest game of all time.  :)
Edit1:I had a bit of trouble with the .tlk files (CEP).  But some servers were just fine.  I LOVE the workshop support, and hope this is fixed soon. Some multiplayer servers work just fine.

I am a bit of a fanboy when it comes to this game, so please take this with a grain of salt.  The ease of access is outstanding on multiplayer servers thus far.

That said, this game is fantastic. It does something I've never seen since, which is give almost complete creative freedom to anyone willing to put in the work. The toolkit and modabillity of this game make it perfect for dedicated players to create fantastic content. If you want to play the singleplayer, the main campain is a little long and boring, but it's a great example of how a campain works. The other modules and community created modules are lots of fun though, so singleplayer is still a decent option.

But where this really shines is the multiplayer experience! If you love role playing, if you love playing Dnd with friends then this is the game for you. Get on to one of the many persistent world role play servers and have a blast meeting characters and making friends and going on adventures. If you don't like role play, then this game may not be for you, but there are still lots of great mutiplayer worlds that are more like traditional MMO's. So if you love RP, then buy it and get on Ravenloft or Arelith and have a great time!

That said, there are issues. The game crashes regularly which can be a real pain. It is an old game, so it doesn't look fantastic. You pretty much have to stick to DnD 3E rules, but I must say it would be sweet if you could mod it to play other games.

Pros:
+The character customisation is pretty good, the best I've seen in games like this.
+The character sheet and dice mentioned for weapons and the like is very accurate to D&D.
+Artwork/graphics of the game is what I'd imagine an official D&D video game would look like.

Cons:
-The camera is impossible to control i.e. you wanted it to face towards an enemy, screw you the camera says while orientated the opposite way.
-There is no way of knowing when your character is going to miss nor how much damage you'll do, like in D&D.

There are a handful of things that could've been included to make the game better, make it cater more to the game it's based on: have initiative rolls for every encounter then make it so the player(s) can see the order, have an overlay for dice rolls, and have a hotkey that lets you turn the camera the way your character is facing.

I am still playing the game, but it is extremely annoying and I have hundreds of crash logs now in my folder due to restarting the game over and over again. You can find many other people complaining about this on google and asking for a fix, but there has not been any updates on this since start of 2018. Looks like it is here to stay.

So in short, beware if you are playing it with a Mac. Might ruin your day.
Very disappointed that this was not fixed before they released it.

I did play (although not very long) when it was originally released 15 or so years ago and it was fun playing it again. The character model graphics haven't aged well but that is a minor quibble to how addictive this game can be once you get the basics down-packed. The tutorial at the begining does a good job of explaining things (although if you have played any CRPG or even an MMO such as WoW) you'll catch on the basics pretty quick. The combat and movement will feel somewhat sluggish for newcomers and the wealth of text (you'll start seeing books you can read early on) can overwhelm. But there is no denying the amount of content that draws you in. Multiplayer has worked well so far at least for coop without a hitch.

Some items to note so far: 
- You can buy the base game now and that is subtracted should you upgrade to the deluxe editon on steam
- Press and hold down the tab key in every room to highlight any objects that can be interacted with (very useful).
- If you played alot of MMOs like I have, driving camera mode works best.
- You and a friend will both need to have the premium module to play together in it (at least from my experience).

I quite enjoyed playing Darkness Over Daggerford all the way through as well as Pirates of the Sword Coast. And I have faith that Beamdog will improve the enhanced edition over time.

If you can get past the dated graphics and enjoy D&D or CRPGS, you should have a blast with this game. I’m about to go back to my second play through of Shadows of Undertide with my Halfling rogue/fighter. He has been getting full of himself and leaning towards evil since defeating the main protagonist of Daggerford. He just murdered a self proclaimed prophet and is shunned by the mayor of a small town. He has severed magical heads with evil powers, a skull looking tribal helmet and two +1 kukris.

For new age fps gamers, games like these take some time to get hooked, they have a slower build than games like COD, give it a few hours, but the long term reward and satisfaction is much greater. Get into the city and make some progress, give it a chance, and you may just find a gem of a game and a new genre you love.

This all comes together in a pretty neat package, giving both new and returning players a D&D CRPG with a lot of depth, plenty of action and some solid story telling bits, something that has become quite rare in recent years.

I originally recommended against this game due to what I consider very questionable remastering quality, but I am changing the thumbwards direction after seeing developers Beamdog and community modders take steps to fix a crippling issue with certain effects causing framerate drops to the unplayable.  It isn't a proper fix exactly, but now with a mod you can disable certain effects that are killer on the framerate and have more enjoyable sessions.

Its not a perfect remaster, I still think the interface is janky and should have more options for sizing and better positioning on modern gaming resolutions.  Visually, I had hoped there were more coming with this re-release than just some post processing effects.  And well, it is still the oldie NWN experience which is sometimes quite fiddly in general.

But it is Neverwinter Nights.  It runs fine for me now, and it is a breeze to play it online thanks to it using Steam now, which I absolutely appreciate.

It's not a pretty game.  That much should be evident from the screenshots.  It really wasn't even all that pretty by 2002 standards when it released, either.  The main campaign's story isn't that great and really not all that worth playing.

So why should you buy it?

For me personally, I prefer to play it on a persistent world RP server - in my case, one called Narfell.  It's essentially an ongoing, drop-in, drop-out character-driven D&D campaign that's been ongoing with a rotating cast of dozens of DM's and hundreds (if not thousands) of player characters since just after the game released.  This is the better part of twenty years worth of highly developed backstory and work put in by players on both sides of the DM/PC divide.  Stories that react dynamically based on specific actions taken by players, in ways that just could not be hard coded into a system without a human playing DM on the other side.

What Neverwinter Nights offers is something no other game does: truly emergent gameplay, tailored specifically to player actions and player choices.  You do need people to play DM to achieve this, and people willing to put dev work into running a successful NWN PW, but there really isn't anything that compares to it when you have those things.

At it's core, what I love is that this is a game of collaborative storytelling.  Other games may have come close, but I can't think of any that have succeeded so completely as this one does.  It has its shortcomings, but it's been my favorite game for half my life and I don't see that changing any time soon.  It's absolutely worth the price of admission.

edit: I think it's also important to note that Beamdog is actively developing this game and continuing to make it better than it was before.  Which considering how great I think it already was, is definitely worth noting.",1522554905,1542838690,True,5,0,0.598765432834625244,0,True,False,False

   Well you have to buy the main game first so I did and I dont regret it. For those who say theres not much diff from original, there are alot of improvements the main being I can run in 1920x1080, doing that with original game causes the center of the screen to appear to the right.

    Secondly the depth of field option is great and the game runs very smoothly. For you modders and CEP fans,
    I ran Endless Nights 4 CEP 2.0 last night and it worked perfectly! (note the hak folder in enhanced edition is now
    simply hk, and you will have to create a tlk folder as this version doesnt have one.)

    So I highly recommend the Enhanced Version as I port from my laptop to a 32"" HD screen, Thanks steam for making my old goto game live again ;)

P.S. For you folks having Crashes and Graphics issues try updating your Direct X drivers as original was running DX 9.0c....Just update your Direct X drivers.

Just one more thing, I havent been able to find the ""Slayerduck_Override"" pack which adds hands, bowstrings etc.. alot of great enhancements to the game via the overrides folder. Slayerduck where r you bro?

I've purchased several games that were made later with all the bells and whistles - but it's always fallen short of NWN.  I can't praise these games enough.

All that said, multi-player is where the game is at.  My advice is to learn how the game works on single-player, then find a persistent server as fast as you can.  No matter how good the single-player campaign is, it can't compare to real players.  Apples and oranges.

why could a game as Neverwinter reached so high a number. For ages, i been playing MMO, in most cases i searched for games that could immerse me in a universe, where i could kinda ""disappear"" for a little while and play a game for pure enjoyment. Elder Scrolls Online, Wow, Eve Online never did give me this ""immersive"" experience i was looking for.

Now i installed Neverwinter Night, and had not even 5 minuttes play in a solo campgain, what i did instead was, log in Multiplayer, and connect to a server that has been around for 12 years.. 12 years!!! This server has sooo much content, that its in comparison to sooo many games this day, has done everything correct.

Now the server is a Roleplaying Server, so what you find there are Players playing a character, and roleplaying that character to the fullest extend, speak, talk, fight PvE or even PvP.

Crafting system that divides in 6 categories, some of them cross over, so you need to speak with other characters, to complete your own crafting. Crafting is: Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Alchemy, Herbalism, Art Crafting and Tailoring. A character through out its level up, gains 2 crafting points per level, and those can either be spent in one crafting, or several crafting, you could be a Jack of all trades, master at none, or specialize your self, so you can make the greatest of the equipment in the game.

XP in game: Writs/Quest are in the game, for players to join up and fight the PvE, to gain a good boost to XP, half of the xp you get instant, the other half is in a XP pool, now here comes the genius part, because of an XP pool, you will earn XP from that pool every 6 min active on the server, giving you time to actually talk with other players, or what ever you want.

Exploration: Chest, dungeons, buried treasures, hidden areas, there are SO many areas, that in my time of the 1800 hours, (in which i DID take time to do alot of RP aswell), i have still not seen every corner of the Server / Arelith Isle as its called.

PvP: Now all PvP, must be made with enough time, so the player you want to engage, has to know that you will attack him soon. This is mostly done my using a ingame mechanic ""Turning youself hostile toward another"" Or by simply talking to the person, for an example. ""You are a Drow, what are you doing here? *Reaches for the weapon*"" This is an clear indication that you are soon to go into PvP. The Server has what we call a Surface, where all Dwarfs, Halflings, Humans and Elves live"". But there is ALSO a quite LARGE area called ""The Underdark"" where Duergar, Gnoll, Goblin, Kobold and Drows can be played as a character. This gives the server a Natural all good PvP experience.

Active DMs: Active dms.. the list is long.. there are several DMs that make stories, or answer question that you seek, and they are observing the Server to make sure, that everyone is having a good time. Active Forum, active Homepage, Wikipedia with tons of information.

Own a House, own a shop, the things you find you can sell, with a ingame selling system, that transfers earned gold directly to your bank. Become even a Mayor of a settlement. This was one of those experiences i had with the game, being part of a community in a settlement. 

After Level 30, what then?
Sacrefice your character, give him a reason to leave the isle, and have a chance to get a Reward. When reaching level 26+ you have optimize the best chance there is to receive a reward, where you are allowed to become a Race that is restricted by a Reward, or even with talk with DMs (after earn the biggest reward there is) you can ASK for a specific race to play, and the matter will be taken up with the current DMs.

The server added content for 12 years, i joined the server about 8 months ago, it has by FAR been the game i played and invested my most time. And this game is competing against: Xcom2, Stellaris, Total Warhammer 1+2, Fallout, Skyrim and so on.

If you seek a game you can immerse your self into, and RP with other players.. this.. might be the game for you.!!

Thank you all for reading this, somewhat long review.

No real changes to the game as well, graphic wise some nicer lighting and textures and if it was only a lack of cosmetic features I could forgive this with the new DLC and the resurrection of the multiplayer but to keep losing my progress is soul destroying and I wish I had saved my money and just played my copy of the diamond edition that I have on GOG, which has no issues!!

So this is more or less a re-re-release. First, we had original NWN back in 2002. Then, at some point, GOG released NWN Diamond. Now we have this. Compared to other releases, online multiplayer in this one actually works as intended out of the box (the original used now-defunct GameSpy service for online server discovery). So there's that. Aside from that, still good old NWN I remember.

If you never played NWN, get this, it's really good. Start off on Shadows of Undrentide though, not on the main campaign (you can come back to it later if you want). And there are a lot of great user-created adventures for this game too, so it'll provide you with many days of fun, provided you can get over early-2000's graphics and at times clunky controls (neither of which are all that bad, but YMMV).

I also have to mention this thing called ""Persistent Worlds"", which is basically like a toy version of MMO before MMO was mainstream (well, okay, Ultima Online was earlier, and NWN servers don't really do the ""massive"" thing, but you get the idea).

If you already own either the original release, NWN Diamond, or both, you still might want to get this for the online multiplayer. ""Enhanced"" graphics options are somewhat pointless, and UI scaling is buggy in my experience, so I don't recommend getting this release for those.

So,

Pros:
+ A modern classic D&D CRPG, a must-have for any collector.
+ Two expansions are great fun to play through (with an occasional unwarranted difficulty spike).
+ A lot of high-quality user-created content.
+ Decent co-op multiplayer (I've played quite a bit with my buddies back in the day and it was tremendous fun).
+ Online multiplayer functionality works as intended for the first time since what feels like forever.

Neutrals:
* Main campaign is slow and dragged-out, less fun to play then the expansions. It's fine for what it is though.
* New graphics filters (bloom, hi-contrast, etc) are rather pointless.

Cons:
- UI scaling is buggy (but YMMV).
- Clunky UI by modern standards.
- Early-2000's 3D graphics. Very blocky. Much low-res.

They did an amazing job with their previous work and when I heard they were making an enhanced version for Neverwinter Nights I was extremely happy. Unfortunatly, my experience with this game has been nothing but frustrating. 

Now when I bought this game, I didnt really expect anything to be ""enhanced"". My previous experience with Beamdog, especially with Baldur's Gate, is that their projects tend to be ongoing for a couple years after release in terms of bringing in enhanced components that really makes their editions shine. Buying a Beamdog game is basically joining them in an adventure on its own in seeing an old game shine in present time. My expectations for purchasing their Neverwinter Nights edition were super low and though I own the orginal game already, I just wanted a version where I didnt have to continue managing three or four cds, not having to google patches, and I wanted a game that was super easy to mod via the steam workshop. In terms of those, Beamdog fullfilled all those criteria.

However, the reason why I can't recommend this game to anyone in its current state is because as of now, the game is unplayable. When I first purchased the game, it ran fine but crashed every five minutes. This seems to be common with other players after researching the issue. After an annoying first week I decided to just uninstall and wait for their next major patch update hoping the crash issues would be resolved. Unfortunatly upon reinstalling the game after the first patch release, the game will no longer load. I can get into the game itself but it now crashes for me everytime I try to start a new campaign. It's been months now and the issues still haven't been resolved. I'll update this review once I can actually play the game but until then it's going to just patiently wait in my steam library.",1535024178,1535024178,False,23,0,0.636196911334991455,0,True,False,False

Instead what you're buying here is the ability to have complete and total multiplayer support once more, a few bug fixes, a few enhanced graphics for things like spells, an enhanced UI, the ability to run at high-end resolutions without it getting choppy and a few other game fixes.

The primary benefit of this game is not any of this, however, but instead is the complete and total support for all previous NWN fan-made modifications, toolset, scripting, and everything else. Just with the original, the true strength of this release comes with the fan support, buying this gives you a superior game you no longer have to jump through hoops to experience running properly, with access to hundreds upon hundreds of hours of free bonus content that varies from custom items to entire custom campaigns.

I've played this game since its release in 2002, and I still played the standard diamond edition from GOG until last year. Now, I'm playing this as well, and even making video series using it as a fantastic storytelling medium. The amount of creative freedom it offers players, is truly fantastic.

I had the GOG Diamond Edition installed when I picked up the Enhanced Edition hoping to see noticeable improvements since I was running the game on Arch Linux through WINE. The most appealing aspect of the purchase was better UI scaling, fewer random crashes, and modest scaling for higher resolution monitors. I was disappointed on every front.

DISCLAIMER: I purchased the game on release and this might not reflect the current state of the game.

    • Comparing the working Diamond Edition in WINE, the emulated version of the game was no more difficult to install via PlayOnLinux than the EE. Really, the only thing I can think of why the port would have been necessary was the hit or miss that was installing the Diamond Edition on OS X.
    • No Toolset for Linux! And considering what the toolset was built with, it is unlikely there will ever be a port of it for Linux or Mac. So I am stuck running the Aurora Toolset in WINE anyway.
    • UI scaling doesn’t/didn’t work on Linux. I used some buggy fan made stuff with the Diamond Edition and had a better experience.
    • Shader changes made the game look even more dated on a higher resolution monitor. I don’t know how, but they managed it.
    • DLC mania. OK, I can understand this one, but it would have been nice if they had actually shipped it with some EE modules (even community ones that they put their own resources into improving).
    • Steam Workshop integration is cool, but it doesn’t do nearly enough to integrate the old NWN Vault. Within the first hour I was already looking at the old NWN Vault. So what is the point?

SUMMARY

I wanted to love this game. I gave Beamdog the benefit of the doubt and in a couple years I might purchase NWN:EE again. But it was such a disappointment and the first game I have ever returned on Steam.

Content: they didnt bother finishing anything that was cut, they didnt bother to finish off the side quests and companion quests in hoards of the underdark, they sure as heck didnt even add in an update to the current rules, heck they didnt even take the already premade content from the vualt like CEP pack or anything to help least give the base game just something new to work with. heck even if they just took the exptended spell hak wich added in more spells for all archan classes would of least been something.

Graphics: it was there mian point and what they did was add bunch of options for HD minitors, no real improvment no real additions and heck no new animations, agian haks had long since made bunch of content for new animations, infact for the old nwn you can get a POV hak and just play the game eldar scrolls style, so i think the old ones still winning.

Bugs/glitchs: see when beamdog did buldergate and few others good reason existed they fixed lot of bugs helped the game run on something other than Win98/XP. but here they haveing to release more patchs becouse they released the game in buggy state, been watching folk scream specialy a few server devs at this, becouse it means more work on the server also there bugs messing up there own code. Its semi stable now but mmm.

Online play: honestly the main thing of the game and i cant say anything bad on it, connects to existing servers that are up and allows folks to host there own games with friends without to much fuss, just becarfull with what server you want to get invested in.


whill be giveing it a thumbs up becouse yeah am going to be playing it roughly 7 hours every weekend on the servers.

Some have crazy name policies, and force delete your characters... 

There's a lot of worlds out there that are free to enter.  Newly on the EE, a Ravenloft world, a Greyhawk world. As well as at least one LOTR's, at least one strange Forgetten Realms Netheril time line/realm.  So I do suggest picking it up.

Buy for single player and play on dedicated servers run with static IPs, but don't expect it to work right if you host a game online yourself at the moment.

TL:DR - Even if you enjoyed NWN in it's original format, YMMV - But only because of bugs that can be fixed and issues or removed features that can be re-added.

The Good:
*Rules parity has been improved, so it closer matches 3.X PnP rules.

*Balance changes that actually MAKE SENSE.

*Some of the most important stuff that required custom server scripting frameworks is now built-into the engine, and alterable via server options. This ranges from making movement untoggle combat modes (Something I think is stupid) to having a hard cap on what might be either total or per item bonuses of key types.

*Server overhead is WAY reduced with fewer players online. This is a great feature for server owners.

*Countless issues that affected multiplayer and caused problems for servers and server owners are fixed.

*Counterspelling is finally not buggy enough that servers end up having to find ways to disable it or punish it's misuse.

*The shadow bug is fixed, and with it a memory leak that caused a crash that I'm sure most people who played the original have experienced. A lot.

*Many minor annoyances in the game fixed. A truckload in fact.

*Crashes and bugs are less frequent by far.

*Modder-Centric features backported from NWN2, such as haks loading before both chargen and overrides

*Huge amount of scripting engine improvements

*New per-area featuresets, many of which are shown in demo modules

*Good steam integration with the UI overlay and friends list.

---

The ""Meh"":
*The premium modules are finally able to be bought again. This is more good than meh, but it's not something everyone will find important.

*Three of the Five postprocess filters actually look nice (Sharpen, Vibrance and SSAO), but the other two look horrible in NWN (Thankfully, these can be replaced via the override folder too!)

*UI scales better, but not perfectly- Some of the UI in places like the main menu are cut off at 1920*1080

---

The Bad
*Workshop content does not load properly in the game, at least where overrides are concerned (and possibly haks). Certain things seem to be prone to breaking.

*The server category filters are missing from the server browser- This means that every server is shown at once.
PVP Arenas are thus right alongside RP servers with no PVP, tech support servers, and people playing modules
with small groups of friends or even just testing to see if certain modules even work in multiplayer are all in the same huge group of servers, meaning that if you want to find something it's a massive headache.

*No indication as to if workshop content other than modules has even been installed. No download notifications either, unlike every other steam game I own with workshop access for mods.

---
The Ugly:
This: https://support.baldursgate.com/issues/36424

---

Would be better if:
*The issues listed in ""The Bad"" and ""The Ugly"" are fixed.

*A way to look at the workshop folder used by the game were implemented as a right click library menu option in steam.

*more postprocess filters were added, like a ""cel shading"" or ""cartoon"" filter. (Originally I wanted Sharpen as a filter, but that has since been added)

*Texture mipmapping tweaks could be applied in-game

*texture filtering could be upgraded in-game to 16x without using graphics card driver options.

*more sound options were added that used the new OpenAL Software sounds in exciting ways.

*servers could autodownload steam workshop content packs to people joining them without the necessary content, complete with a message saying ""The following content pack was added to your subscriptions by the server automatically: ______"" This feature was in NWN2 in a certain way, by means of the servers providing autodownloader links that would cause NWN2 to download the necessary files themselves; it would be very useful for NWN:EE

*As much of the hardcoded feats and abilities as possible were converted to use nwscript instead, so as to allow easy replacement for servers (Again, this is something that NWN2 had).

*A ""Mature Content"" filter tag and ""No Mature Content"" filter were added to the server browser- This would help filter out servers that have content unfriendly to minors, or have overtly sexual or grotesque themes (Without removing them from being accessed entirely). The community would probably self-moderate this well enough with those tools and this implimentation to make this not-so-minor-friendly game at least somewhat more friendly to people under 18 (Like I was when I first owned the original).",1522817861,1532235035,True,5,0,0.564604341983795166,0,True,False,False

The main kicker for the Enhanced Edition is the revival of the multiplayer system, which includes support for custom modules and all that jazz.

The base game is, well, not very enhanced, so I can't recommend this for a nostalgia playthrough (and honestly as the campaigns are solo-character, that's not really what D&D was made and balanced for). Quite lazy and/or nonexistent updates on the graphics and UI part sort of left me with a sour feeling, this felt like an early access version of what should have been the actual EE. Having played some of the campaign, there are still quite easily encountered bugs and other unpolished stuff like audio balancing.

Neverwinter NIghts was my first experience with the D&D world and I had LITERALLY NO CLUE as to what the hell I was doing when I played this game. I sprinted through all of the campaigns not even paying attention to the story, and half the time not knowing what was even going on. Then I fell into the endless heaven that was online play. Back in 2002 there were a ton of servers that you could access! From hardcore RP PvE to insane level 40 PvP your choices were basically limitless. There was where I fell in love with this game, and what made me really start to understand what D&D was as a whole.

Fast forward 16 years and this game...this f****** game is still the great and amazing game that I experienced way back in 2002. Are things really ""ENHANCED"" a bit yeah, but it still retains the majority of what made it so incredible back then. Everything from the insanely unbalanced classes and skills all the way to the smalles of bugs and glitches. I love it! It's like stepping back into my childhood and staying up until 6am battling dragons, and beholders. The online server list has trimmed down significantly in these past 16 years. Most if not all servers are dedicated to heavy RP PvE. Would love to see some of my favorites PvP servers (almost all of which I have forgotten the names to, but would recognize) comeback.

This being said I have encountered one really BIG AND I MEAN BIG bug. At some point, I don't know how it happened I lost the ability to use edge screen camera rotation. Luckily I was maybe 20mins into the campaign when this happened to me. I searched and searched and searched for an answer to why this was happening and I couldn't find a thing. I eventually hit a brick wall and ended up having to uninstall the game, hunt down the game folder and wipe every trace of Neverwinter Nights off my PC. I then reinstalled and everything was back to normal.

The 3d sound in this game though is horrible and there is no way to make it 2d without everything being almost muted (some reason it removes most sound effects and lowers the volume and doesn't let you fix this). The way the 3d sound works is it is based off your camera so if you are listening to a conversation from an NPC and your camera is looking at them from one side you will only hear that NPC from one ear which is just horrible. The reason I have so many hours in this one is because of the Multiplayer. Sadly I will randomly get disconnected from any multiplayer server every few hours.

Yeah I would recommend this game to my friends, and I will tell you why, not by breaking down what the game is - but my reasons for buying it AGAIN. Beamdog isn't providing us with a new game and it's pretty obvious that they weren't trying to sell you a new game anyway so I'm not sure why some people are judging this purchase based off that.

Here are why I bought this:

-It runs on windows 10 without me attaching a bunch of 3rd party tools to trick the engine into thinking i'm using a 15 year old graphics card.
-it has multiplayer support, I also.. do not need to fiddle with 3rd party tools or with the game's built in configuration to enable this, it works out of the box and with my steam friends
-its on steam, yeah I could've gotten it on GOG but my steam account is 100x more secure and it's just better for me organization-wise.
-minor engine improvements, if anyone has ever fiddled with old engines on new systems, it's a royal PITA I don't think most of us enjoy doing any of that nonsense, given what the price is, it's pretty worth it to not have to do any of that.


As for the game itself it's just Neverwinter Nights, there's really nothing more to say. The post-processing effects are a nice touch but I don't really care, either you turn them on or off, not going to write a paragraph bitching about how fuzzy the depth of field is like it somehow detracts from the game or my recommendation, that's just weird.

I'll say the same for the scaling too, yeah it's a little odd but I don't use it, the default size is perfectly fine, if anything I would only enlarge specific items on the interface like the minimap, portrait and the compass but that still doesn't count as a negative in my book, it's a game from 2002 getting support back that's worth the $20.

If you're a millennial I would suggest you stay away from this game, has a lot of simple math. 2 + 2 doesn't equat to chai latte, it equates to 4.. so you probably died. gg.",1530978422,1530978422,True,38,30,0.52787017822265625,0,True,False,False

I first played Neverwinter Nights around 2004. At that point, I had only played the single player portion. It wasn't until 2007 when I played on my first multiplayer server and truly had my mind blown. It's so strange how a game (especially an RPG) that has a generally forgettable single player experience is one of my favorite games. This is, in large part, due to the multiplayer community and the extremely flexible toolkit that comes with the game. It is like no game I have ever played. Even 14 years later, I can still find excitement in the multiplayer (and even some of the single player) experiences.

As for some not-so-good points… there are a couple of strange things about this game’s price and content. For a game that’s over a decade and a half old, why on earth are all of the premium modules not bundled in with the base game? Especially for the $20 price? Also, $3 for several character portraits? I can’t help but feel disappointed that Beamdog is really nickel and diming this. 

On top of that, calling it an “enhanced edition” may lead many to believe it received a lot more enhancements than it did. NWN largely looks and plays exactly like it did all those years ago.

I think this is the 4th or 5th time I've bought this game, and I've never regretted it. Neverwinter Nights is a phenomenal adaptation of D&D's 3rd Edition ruleset, even flawed as it is.
I think a lot of people are disappointed with the Enhanced Edition because it isn't ""Enhanced"" enough for them, but the game's migration to Steam is the most important part of it. Steam integration means the game is easier to play than ever, especially multiplayer. Mods are added with a single click, and Beamdog has done a lot of work to make sure that old mods are still compatible with the Enhanced Edition version. Some of the most popular mods of NWN history are now available in the Community Workshop, and more coming as the game's dedicated fanbase continues to treat the game with the love they have since the game's release more than a decade ago.
[h1]This Game Is Old and Imperfect[/h1]
Neverwinter Nights has not aged the best, but it has a certain charm that the passage of time fails to dispel. The story is adequate, and holds up well enough. The depth of character customization and mechanics is there, but the simplified 3E system leaves a lot out of the mix that I know people would love to see. A lot of the more popular Prestige Classes aren't in the game, for example, and the PRC that added them isn't currently on the Workshop, but is supposedly being worked on for the EE. Someday.
[h1]Enhanced Edition Exclusives[/h1]
The Enhanced Edition (Deluxe) brings with it more than just a tweaked engine and Steam integration. You also get procedurally generated infinite dungeons to play through with your friends, a number of fantastic premium modules (Darkness over Daggerford has been greatly enhanced with things like new music and voiceovers), and some less important stuff like new portraits. The best part of this is probably the Infinite Dungeons add-on, which is great to play with friends. Or would be if I had any.
[h1]Should You Buy?[/h1]
Ask yourself the following questions:
- Do I mind outdated graphics?
- Do I hate single player RPG's with good stories?
- Do I hate D&D?
- Do I have no friends?

If you answered no to at least the first two, you should get the game. If you answered no to all of them, consider getting the Deluxe edition.",1530220314,1530220314,True,14,3,0.600370883941650391,0,True,False,False

The game itself is the best RPG of my life. According to howlongtobeat, the OC is 50+ hours long and the HoTU expansion is almost 30 hours of epic campaign. With multiplayer and custom modules, the game can last countless hours.

Don't expect 100% DnD rules. For example, Arcane Archer on this game can only imbue fire(and there are a lot of fire resistant/immune enemies) compared to PnP who can imbue other elements, you can only be a Red Dragon Disciple, some spells works differently than PnP, others are missing but despite this flaws, the game is pretty good, very immersive and deep experience.

Here is a little gameplay(non enhanced edition) of neverwinter nights 1. The enhanced edition have better graphics,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZa9MDbH4Zk

If the game is soo good, why i don't know if i can recommend? Because the ""Enhanced edition"" version of this game lacks most things that the community asked. For example, allowing custom spellbooks to have custom classes on the game, making conjuration a viable specialization by unnerfing conjuration and making conjuration like PnP, addicting new classes and spells like others ""enhanced edition"" games received, etc. Also, some bugs that wasn't on the non enhanced edition was present on this edition. I lost a save since on this save, i was unable to rest, don't matter how much time it takes.  And i wasen't able to isntall PRC on this ""Enhanced edition"".

The game is 9.5/10(10/10 if followed 100% the PnP rules), but the ""Enhanced Edition"" is not that ""Enhanced"". 
Beamdog did a amazing job with Baldur's Gate and Icewind dale, with this enhanced edition, i hoppe that will become better. Other good thing. Linux support. I don't need PlayOnLinux + Wine to run NWN.",1530053007,1530053007,True,5,0,0.512744426727294922,0,True,False,False

=Intro=

I am a massive DND nerd and have enjoyed the re-releases of classics like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. Finally, we get Neverwinter Nights and...it's awesome but not without serious issues.

=Gamplay= 

The main campaigns follow a standard pulpy DND story, of wizards, dragons, demons and elves. The major difference is that rather than controlling a party, you have one character with 1-2 ai 'companions'. 

The standard campaign is still solid, but it's bland story and underwhelming design falls short of the glory of Baldur's Gate. The additional campaigns are a mixed bag, with Hordes of the Underdark being the only really strong entry. 

The main weakness that stood out to me was the ai of the companions, who you have extremely limited control over - constantly getting stuck on scenery, not following correctly, rushing in to attack anything they see unless you order them to be passive.

Of course, the reason the game is so famous is it's amazing toolset, allowing players to make their own content fairly easily and this remains the biggest selling point of the package, especially with the incredible additional user content available to download elsewhere.

=Graphics=

This game has not aged well, like so many early 3D titles. The additional effects and polish in the remaster are reasonable, but the major problem is that something seems broken in terms of optimization - outdoor areas chug along at abysmal framerates even on a powerful system.  

=Story=

Well told fantasy pulp. The main campaign is very meh, but the additional campaigns fare better. 

=Value=

There is a lot of game here for the price, and endless possibilities available via user created content or making your own.

=Overall=

+ A faithful re-release of a well loved game.
+ Toolset is amazing.
+ Endless content to play.

- Performance issues and bugs detract from the experience.
- Classic campaign does not hold up well.
- Companion AI is still awful.
- Not as high a quality 'remaster' as previous titles.

Well, they seem to have released a new DLC called ""Darkness Over Daggerford"".
I have no issue with them selling new DLC (other than that said module is free in the internet).
The issue is that they added that DLC to the deluxe edition and I don't have access to it, NOT ONLY THAT, but now in the store page, it appears I don't own the deluxe edition. It says ""Buy Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Digital Deluxe""
""Complete your collection"".
As If I never bought the deluxe edition (and as I showed you, I bought it the day it was released). It appears as If I bought the DLC one by one and never bought the last 2.

That's shady.
It is NOT ok to release DLC outside of season passes or deluxe editions, those exist for people that want the complete game.
It's SPECIALLY not ok to release new DLC INSIDE deluxe editions and season passes and remove that from previous buyers.
There is not a deluxe edition 1.0 and deluxe edition 2.0 in the store is there?
There is not a season pass 1 and season pass 2 in the store, is there?
There's not a DLC pack 1 and DLC pack 2, is there?
I paid for the deluxe edition. I should get what is inside the deluxe edition.

Or at least KEEP the deluxe edition.
FACT: I was told I would get all DLC. 
FACT: I did not.
FACT: I bought the deluxe edition.
FACT: It says in the store page I didn't.

OF COURSE I didn't expect anything to be added to the deluxe edition, or for that matter, If anything was added to it, I would expect to receive it since I BOUGHT THE DELUXE EDITION!!!!

Let's use an example:
If you go to the store pga in Arma 3 you'll see a couple of DLC packs.
They are numbered.
If you buy the DLC pack 1 but not others, it's natural they'll make stuff for DLC pack 2 (or 3 or wahtever) and you WONT get it.
HOWEVER, you WOULD expect to get anything added to DLC pack 1, wouldn't you?
AND CERTAINLY, you wouldn't expect that if they added something to it, they would change your status from having DLC pack 1, to not having it.
That's shady

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, I expect to KEEP the deluxe edition status, SINCE I BOUGHT THAT!!!!

Beamdog is a developer famous for exploiting nostalgia, exploiting fans from other companies nad being greedy.

Don't make the mistake I made and buy this game.

Just go to a reseller and get the old Diamond Edition. It still works well in modern systems, it's cheaper and you won't get scammed.


EDIT: I want to also add that if you're looking for model or texture enhancements, they are NOT here. They were promised and some (like 2) have been added to the workshop on release day.

After the latest patch game is finally playable on Linux. I had to alt+enter to enable fullscreen, so it wasn't automatically, but at least it is possible now. Kudos! Changing status to recommended.

Original review:

I don't want to give a negative review. I played the original and all the expansions (and a number of community-created modules), and I love this game to bits. Just the thought of being able to return to this game again after many years fills me with a sense of giddy anticipation. 

But as of today (31 March), the linux version just renders in a tiny window in the center of the screen, with no way that I can find to scale it up to a playable size. It is simply unplayable in this state. I have high hopes that it will be fixed shortly, and the moment it is I will change this review to reflect that fact.

Out of all 13 BioWare RPGs in existence, this one is BY FAR my least favorite. Mass Effect Andromeda puts this dumpster fire to shame. Its horrible graphics style from the early 2000s have aged MUCH worse than Dragon Age Origins and the engine has wretched pathfinding, even worse than the Infinity Engine. This is a pretty standard BioWare story, and by that I mean basically every CRPG and BioWare game out there has writing at least as good as this, but this game also has abyssmal gameplay. You can only control one character, and your henchman is entirely AI controlled. You can give them commands, but those commands won't stop your henchman from...

1. Getting stuck in the middle of an open room for no good reason
2. following you into a storage room and standing in the doorway locking you in there for eternity until you decide to give up and go play a good game, or just reload. (Because for some reason you can't give movement commands.)
3. Standing behind you asking ""should I attack?"" while 17 Ogres are sodomizing you. (especially frustrating when your henchman is meant to be the tank and you are a wizard with less hit points and armor class than your level)
4. Forcing you to have to tell him to ""follow me"" every time a fight ends, and command him to ""attack"" every time a fight begins. 

And believe me when I tell you that issuing those commands is not as simple as hitting a hotkey. Another thing about this game is how horrible the UI is, forcing you to pour through several interfaces just to find the type of command or action you want. There is a hotbar, but it's mapped to the function keys and you can't set your own hotkeys, like you could in the Baldur's Gate series. It seems like they just wanted to make the UI worse than their previous games on purpose, just to make Baldur's Gate 2 look good. Well they succeeded!

And after all that struggle, I made it (hopefully) close to the end of chapter 2, I have explored about 20 different dungeon/cave levels and have poured through all available areas in chapter 2, but still have no conceivable way to proceed through the game. (pretty sure it's a glitch, I'm supposed to find evidence for the bad guys location, and I have, but they keep telling me I haven't found enough evidence, even though I have found 4 letters and I was specifically told at the beginning of chapter 2 that I only need to find 2.) 

But the bottom line is that there are two big reasons I do not recommend this game. One is Baldur's Gate 2, the other is Neverwinter Nights 2. You should play either of those titles if you want something very similar to the Neverwinter Nights CRPG experience, except with...
1. A much better graphical design that has rich texture detail and generates a realistic image, instead of squre trees and triangular shaped people.
2. Vastly superior mechanics with an incredibly friendly and simple, customizable UI that allows you to do whatever you want with it. 
3. Party based combat that lets you control a full party, plan and customize their builds, and position the support, tanks, utilities and DPS where you need to in each fight, instead of bashing your head against an army of monsters while your AI controlled henchman watches and laughs.
4. A vastly better story that rivals the best novels and TV shows because of how much more complex the plot is and how many more characters there are, and how much more developed they are.
5. An infinitely superior villain. 
6. Much more immersive quests with much more creative and artistic environment design.

The one thing to say about Neverwinter Nights is that it has possibly the best soundtrack of any video-game in history, but the problem is, Neverwinter Nights 2 has all of the same soundtracks added alongside some new ones that are just as good, so Neverwinter Nights 2 is nothing but better in every way, especially the soundtrack.

I suppose the DM tool is the reason to play this game, but as a singleplayer experience, especially by BioWare's 2000s standards, this game is quite lame.

The EE does a lot of fixing on the inside (this old game needed it) but not much of a facelift (at the time of this posting). I would like to see something to update the looks but it doesn't ruin it for me. I've only had the game crash once - that places it miles ahead of my GOG copy of the game (that copy is a pre-enhance edition).

The campaign is okay but a little boring. The two expansions for it however are much more polished and enjoyable. Hordes of the Underdark being in the Top 10 of my favorite adventures CRPG.

I'm playing a paladin and took Tomi.  I've told him to stay far away and only use missile weapons.  Nearly half of all fights he somehow manages to stay close enough that he is always getting meleed by the mobs.  If there's any kind of obstruction to his line of sight, he walks around the corner until he's right next to me even though he could stop well before me and still maintain line of sight.  Unbelievably, if we're fighting multiple enemies, he'll ALWAYS switch to another one if I start attacking the one he's attacking.  Also, even though I told him to stick with missile weapons, he does so even if he's surrounded which means attack of opportunity one after another.
I remember playing back in the day (years ago with Diamond Edition) and installing some of the more popular addons.  One of them (PRC?) VASTLY improved the interactions with henchmen.
-Control their inventory
-Give detailed tactical instructions like, stay far back, if you're engaged in melee move out of the area, if you're surrounded or stuck switch to a melee weapon
For me, it made the game go from nearly unplayable to a masterpiece.
I'm playing addon free this go round because I'd really like to complete the game as is, but the henchmen AI makes me want to punch a halfling.

I'd also forgotten how awful some of the scaling is.

+ The client runs under Linux and OS/X now.
+ Comes with expansions and premium modules included.

Bad:
- The toolset is Windows-only, doesn't look like this is going to change anytime soon.
- Feels like an early access version of an ""enhanced"" NWN - not much has changed so far.

Neutral:
- The developer promised to extend support for modding. That's great, but for now it's mostly just promises.

I have just updated to the current development version and am pleased to say the full screen problem on Linux is solved. I'm now very much enjoying playing this timeless classic again natively on my Linux desktop for the first time and highly recommend it!

Edit update: The latest patch has improved things. The UI isn't tiny anymore and it does launch into ""full screen"" now. Kudos to the dev team for being responsive.  However it's still not right so my rating for the moment stays the same. The Desktop is still in the foreground with the game playing full size but in the background to other destop elements such as the task bar (both on XFCE and GNOME). The desktop task bar still overlays the game ui. The game needs to either run in it's own xserver or it needs to be set to a realtime priority over the main desktop xwindow. Currenly I can work around this by building an xwindows sessions with no taskbars. Not ideal.

[original review]
It's not that I don't recommend it but rather I don't recommend it yet. Simply put - as a linux user it feels like I'm alpha testing the product. You simply cannot play the game effectively on linux with 1920 X 1080 resolution (a common resolution schema). The ui won't go into full screen mode even when hard coding the ini file to make it do so. As a result the destop borders overlay functionally required UI elements like the task bar. Additionally the UI is scaled to be tiny at that resolution and this does not adjust (though it is meant to). With my admittedly poorish eyesight I can't read the dialogue. 

I have the original version of the game and it is awesome - a classic and largely responsible for hooking me into the genre. So I 100% support Beamdog in their efforts to release it as an updated linux available game. However unless, like me, you want to support them in this effort, I suggest waiting before you buy - until they iron out the UI issues.

So I played this on its initial release back in 2002.  I had just graduated highschool.

Here's what I like:

- Mounted combat, pretty much anywhere (even indoors/dungeons), with a Paladin (by way of the Summon Mount spell), in the original campaign.  The mechanics here seem to suggest that this is better to do with a two-handed weapon, because it appears that being mounted takes away my Paladin's ability to gain bonuses from his shield.  But yeah, I went to the Prison district in the first chapter, went into the prison, mounted up, and fought everyone from horseback.  If you're not mounted, the Paladin's mount seems to function similar to a Ranger's animal companion.  I like this.

What I don't like:

- You get 1 henchman at a time in the original compaign.  This feels dated.  You have no direct control over your henchman without using some kind of mod.  You can't give them things to hold.  This is a bummer because in the Wyvern Crown DLC, you can fully kit out your henchman and manipulate their gear as you see fit.  I'd much have preferred 2 henchmen (as a Paladin, if I want locks and traps handled, I am stuck with just Tomi, forever).

- They didn't include feats from Neverwinter Nights 2.  This seems like a trivial thing to do, for me, an unskilled consumer that has no experience writing game code.  So the feats from vanilla are still the same feats you've got now.  I liked the feat options in NWN2 much better (Monkey Grip anyone?).

- They didn't touch the graphics, at all, for 3d models.  This sounds harder to do.  But yes, the models of buildings and animals and characters and trees are all the same as they were in 2002.  I have not noticed any retouching of spell effects.  The 3d character models in this game look far worse than the 2d sprites from Baldur's Gate.  I would have been happier if they would have redone them.

Do I reccomend this?  Yes, I do.  Enjoy your trip through an RPG classic.  But don't expect a drastically altered experience.  This is a worse Enhanced Edition than they did for Baldur's Gate.

Or, well, what I've seen of it. I've played through the tutorial, all was seemingly well, and then I clicked the door to leave... and it crashed. The farthest I've been is to the Hall of Justice directly after the tutorial dungeon.

It is incredibly disheartening and frustrating to be so excited for a game because you missed out on it when it orriginally released just to be able to play it for ""4 hours"" when most of that time was dedicated to building and reading about character backgrounds.

The game is a bit dated in terms of graphics, yes, but not so much that it is a turn off. It feels more like a classic RPG that laid the foundations for what RPG's are now. I also think the writing is spot on between ""there's way too much text here"" and ""I don't understand what I'm supposed to do, give me more text!"". Great balance there. If there was anything in terms of controls that are the most confusing, I would probably say that it feels almost as though the camera and movement is inverted. Not vertically, but horizontally.

It's turn-based, but very smooth (and really, you could play it as if it wasn't turn-based), and the story is extremely deep.  Again, *for those who have never played* keep in mind that this is a totally different game mechanic than most of what you're used to - go slow.  Don't rush from thing to thing.  Read everything, and make notes to yourself.  This game is oldschool enough that you can still benefit from having a paper notepad at your elbow for keeping yourself organized.  The in-game journal is _just_ enough to keep you on track, but without your own paper notes, you might find yourself messed up.  There are _tons_ of side-quests that only open up if you talk to ALL the characters, sometimes repeatedly, and sometimes you have to level up to progress in some of the individual NPC story lines (and side-quests).  These are usually VERY lucrative.  The game is highly varied based on your character choices, too.  A lot more than any other game I've played.  They're not just superficial differences, either - whole story lines are only available to certain character combinations.  

*FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED BEFORE*
This edition of the game is very polished and smooth, and they've addressed some of the old bugs from the old days.  However, there are still some challenges when it comes to the graphics engine - for some reason, the game hammers my video card harder than it should.  In addition, on my Linux machine, it doesn't handle full-screen correctly (which might actually explain the video card abuse).  Changing resolutions simply changes the size of the borderless window that it plays in - and it doesn't position that window properly, either.

First, read the next two points, then make a decision and GO BUY.

1.  CHECK YOUR EXPECTATIONS jeebus.  This isn't a 2017 remake of NWN, but more of an update to make NWN less Diablo 1 like.  Have you tried playing Diablo 1 recently?  Grainy, impossible to see, etc.  They didn't update the graphics or models here but alot is IMPROVED.  If I could have played the game this way when I first bought it it would have fullfilled my hopes and dreams.

2.  Having purchased the Gog version, and the original, expansions, diamond edition pre-Gog I can tell you I immediately could tell how much CLEANER and more pleasant it was to play this version.  Yes, you can't make out facial features (do you have any idea the amount of work needed to do that?) and yes, everything is still all angles.  But it's just so, so, so much better.  Just the fact that the text uses high res fonts and the quickbar is clean helps game play immensely.


I imagine that if you're a younger millenial (I'm on the older millenial side) or gen Z you may have exceedingly unrealistic expectations of this because of the world you've grown up in.  To be fair, Beamdog didn't do a good job setting expectations (they were too vague), so they should shoulder some blame, but once you reset your expectations you'll really enjoy this.

If anyone from Beamdog reads this I hope they keep working on this cuz I really appreciate it!!!  And, contact me if you ever need help with managing expectations >.>

I played the original game religiously from its release until WoW's release. Never touched the single player - Only played on an RP server called Anphillia. Been playing on the Anphillia server on this version, and it hits all those good good nostalgia notes. 

Apart from the nostalgia aspect, the game itself is fine. Nothing has really been ""enhanced,"" except for the resolution and the fact that it has working multiplayer. The graphics haven't really been updated at all - they might've improved the particles and lighting, but the models are as chunky as ever. Missing some modern comforts for things like inventory management and chat. Overall it's been awesome to have Anphillia back, but I'm not sure the single player would make the game worthwhile.

I'm playing with MacBook Pro with intel graphical card. But I don't think this is the problem. I used to play the GOG version in wine and it runs effortlessly with resolution of 2560*1080. However, with this ""enhanced"" edition, the FPS struggles at about 20 and the fan howling. But I can't see any noticeable difference between this two editions. What causes such degeneracy in performance?
And there are some intolerable bugs. Whenever I played for about an hour or two, then loading the game. Boom! 4fps! Have to restart the game to fix this. It happens EVERYTIME! Thank you for reminding me I have played for too long.
The only ""enhancement"" I see in this version for now is the 2x scaled blurry UI. Well, it indeed is easier to look. But I was expecting a UI enhancement like the Infinity Engine EE series. Recall the first release of BGEE, it didn't make much change to the utilities of the original UI but make it high resolution and fit better to large screen. All the other changes are delivered with future updates. I read the discussions in the forum and understand that you have a lot of ideas on improving the UI, but I really think you should start from small things like you did with BGEE, high resolution and better fitting on screen first. You can add all your fancy features in later updates but not put it in the icebox and simply show us this stupid zig-zag thing.
I think the quality of this game is far from formal releasing at the current state. It is not a beta and I'm not interested in testing compatibilities and bugs for you.

Extra functions and graphic updates would be great and given you can sort out HAKs etc through the workshop is improvement. I wont talk about the toolset, my knowledge wouldn't do it justice, this is about the game as a player.

One key thing is -  it revitallises the NWN community, making servers available easily once more.

I have been on a few getting back into it. I thought I was being nostalgic for that old school RP - nope - people (both players and creators) have been creating masterpieces and players on these small servers are fun and interesting. DM involvement is there, and even when you're on the sidelines, it makes a difference to the entire player base mentality and encourages people to RP and maintain immersion.

For online RP not using a tabletop simulator such as roll 20 et al, this is the best experience I know of out there. Consistently well curated and encouraging creativity from both the DMs and the players - exactly what RP is about.

UPDATE: The premium modules are included, 3 of them.

But anyway, that does not smaller the fun value, I played the orginal disc version of nwn with both disc based addons multiple times and I could enjoy it over and over again. It was only much much later, that I found out, there were purchaseable premium modules.

The game offers a little bit of everything for everyone. The campaigns themselves range from the basic to the truly spectacular.

Everyone should take a look at it with this Enhanced Edition
The price is worth it i gues.. ofc if you want it cheaper you can buy the standard diamond edition for probably less than half of it yet the enhanced has easier multiplayer, buggfixes, compability fixes aswell as a more stable build.
Not that many features got added, its backwards compatible with old savegames and mods though so there is a shit ton of adventure modules for those that dont like the wonderful story of Neverwinter or already know it all

You cant play MP with the older versions due to version and added content
So you either play Diamond edition or Enhanced. If all friends still play diamond it might be worth still playing diamond. New players will likely grab the enhanced edition over the diamond. The danger of splitting a community sadly exists with this - but once the enhanced edition is fully completed some ppl might mod Diamond to a way they can play together on mp as they were able to in the betabuilds  (and besides i think every loyal fan that played this for ages can drop 20$ once in a while on a remake like this)

Second, I'd like to respectfully dispel a fairly common sentiment, particularly among those who are singleplayer oriented(of which I am included): the game is neither unplayable nor buggy. And I've also read some negative reviews that mentioned that the graphics weren't upgraded, which is true, but I would argue it doesn't really matter: the graphics arn't abhorrent and possess the early 2000s charm that will strike most with a sense of nostalgia. I do not deny though that the graphics could be improved, I'm just saying its not a reason to not recommend the game. As for the bugs, as of the time of writing this review the game literally came out a week ago and all bugs I have encountered thus far have been mild and not game-ruining. There is ample time for patches to solve these problems.

Now, as for why this review is positive it did what it set out to do: it brought back Neverwinter Nights and while its true that you can just get Neverwinter Diamond Edition for cheaper simply purchasing it on Steam is easier: I do have NWN Diamond Edition(and have recently played through the campaign and the expansions :), the original campaign is my favorite but I also really like the first chapters of Undrentide and Underdark) and let me tell you its a pain to get it to run on a contemporary set up atleast for me. Not only that but since it is being developed again we can expect further improvements as time moves forward in contrast to the original which hasn't been updated in many years(not complaining, the game had a long and healthy life-span). If you played NWN or NWN 2 as a kid or young adult then this is a clear purchase. If you like RPGs, particularly older ones, or are a fan of the D&D universe then this is also a very good purchase. 

However, most important about this ""Enhanced Edition"" is one thing and one thing only: the Steam Workshop. It essentially makes oppurtunities for adventure limitless and ensures that the game will have a more or less thriving community that is constantly generating new content. The potential is massive and the game is sufficiently malleable. Also important is the Multiplayer: D&D and its derivative games are meant to be played in groups and though I almost exclusively played Singleplayer back in the glory days of Neverwinter I am nonetheless excited to see what comes of the growing multiplayer community especially considering I have recently started to play tabletop D&D with my friends.

So if you are a fan of RPGs, an Ex-NWN player or are looking for an evolving multiplayer scene then this game would fit you well.

If you are none of the above, consider the cost and examine the game to see if you'd enjoy it: its an interesting game with adventure at its core where you can create your own person with his or her own unique abilities specially tailored to your preferences. You complete quests and guide your character's development whether it be by choosing new, unique traits, learning new spells or deciding to gain a level in a new class. The learning curve is moderate but conquerable and the game is admittedly flawed in presentation, although the latter will likely be changed in future patches.

I sincerely hope that this game will be refined and we can see a new renaissance for one of the most memorable games of all time :), the potential is massive.",1522869228,1522869228,True,4,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the game looks exactly the same to the Diamond Edition. Graphics were hardly improved, and I would go as far as to say, it's gotten worse. I noticed that whenever you zoom in closer to your character, the surrounding becomes really blurry. The previous iteration's surroundings remained crisp and clear. It makes the game look unfinished or unprofessional.
In addition, there's been numerous problems with EE that were not seen in the older version such as constant crashes and lag problems. This is a huge problem when you're trying to fight mobs and can't even tell whether you're taking damage or not. It makes rearranging your inventory a nightmare, and there's a ton of rubberbanding, making quick travel between locations near impossible. In terms of the crashes, through some testing, it seems like it targets Intel graphics cards. It makes multiplayer unplayable, which, for the most part, is the biggest concern for the community.
I still have hopes that these issues will be streamlined sooner rather than later but until then, this is my conclusion:
-There has been little to no graphical improvement when compared to Diamond Edition
-The multiplayer scene is spotty/impossible to play, with constant crashes and lag.
-You're really playing for the ability to either play the single player campaign [which you can find most of it at half this price with Diamond Edition] or to play on the multiplayer servers, migrated and new.

If you have NEVER played Neverwinter Nights, Welcome! This game was released in 2002, and is probably the best implementation of 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons into a videogame that I've seen. It may not hold up graphically to most newer games, but the story and level of detail in the maps is wonderful. 

If you played the original, like I did, it's funcitonally the same game. But if you didn't buy it on GoG, you won't have to do the mess to make it work on current computers, and it's notably more stable than the original. 
The biggest change for you will be that you don't have to deal with GameSpy anymore for Multiplayer (!!!) and even went as far as to implement steam multiplayer and workshops support so it's even easier to get into the modded servers. Additionally, if the support is anything like what Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2 got, I think we're safe for a good while, there's no risk of them useing this as a pump-and-dump.

If you are a content creator, They've updated the Aurora Toolset. Unfortunately, I have little experience with this, so I can't say a whole lot here, but I'll update this review if this changes,


The most important thing to take home here is this:

- Do you want to play something that is DnD, but in a video game?
- Do you not mind playing something with dated graphics?

Yes, it is easy enough to pick up the original on GOG for less, but you'll have to tinker with multi-player to get it working.  If it all boils down to price, go with GOG.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for a product where multi-player and resolution settings immediately work, I recommend purchasing this title on Steam. 

Beamdog met its release date, and I'm sure there will be more enhancements.  I don't mind spending the extra money for the DLC knowing I'm not paying for abandonware.  Yes, the game still shows its age for now, and likely always will to some degree.  However, it was a game I truly enjoyed years ago, and unlike the GOG version, I didn't have to tweak any .ini files just to get things working .

If you enjoyed the original, and the price does not seem too high for you, it is worth picking up.  Time will tell how successful it becomes, but more is almost certainly coming from Beamdog in regards to enhancements.  Nonetheless, if you are holding high expectations, and are on a strict budget, either go with GOG, or wait and see what transpires with the new Steam version.

In regards to some of the negative reviews, one must keep in mind that it is a slow and arduous task to enhance a game while ensuring backward compatibility.  That is even more the case with so much preexisting community content.  Current improvements over the GOG Diamond version are limited, and whether or not it is worth the expense at this point is subjective.  

If you view it as an investment are and patient for future enhancements, you are more likely to be pleased.  However, if you are seeking immediate gratification, there is a higher probability of disappointment.  Yes, additional graphical enhancements could have been possible upon launch, but not without risk of breaking code dependencies.

As you read reviews, consider the above and you will see a rather consistent pattern regarding those who are satisfied versus those who are not.  Though I was personally hoping for a few additional enhancements at launch, I've really enjoyed being able to get the game up and running without effort.

The original Neverwinter Nights came out back in 2002, and this is just an ""enhanced"" version of it.  But it's only $20, as opposed to the $60 I paid back in 2002.  And while you COULD obtain a copy of the original Neverwinter Nights, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't.

Firstly, the original Neverwinter Nights is no longer supported by the developers (who were Bioware, and the publisher was Atari).  This version is a newly enhanced version by Beamdog, and they've made some changes that are welcome.  First and foremost is support for widescreen resolutions.  Secondly is better shaders for lighting and shadows.  They've also updated some of the textures and models.  But the biggest one is the reason I enjoy NWN: multiplayer support!

See, years ago Atari / Bioware took down the master servers for Neverwinter Nights.  It was technically possible to play online, but you had to use direct connections and every server had to make their own login system to accomodate the fact that there was no copy/cd-key authentication to automatically determine that stuff for the server.  It wasn't a real game breaker by any means, but it was a major inconvenience and for a lot of servers it meant that it was now much harder to get new players, because there was no central source for people to just click on and play.

NWN:EE has 100% backward compatibility support (at least, they say it does anyway) for the original NWN's modules, so you can take your old addons, pop them into NWN:EE and away you go.  I've put thousands of hours into NWN, but now finally NWN is available on Steam, so you can load up, hit the multiplayer button, and go find yourself a server to play on.  I can see myself putting a lot more time into NWN now that it's back and running on a central server.

One word of warning is that the premium content modules are optional, and right now there are no mods/user addons that make use of anything relating to them.  So only get them if you're interested in the singleplayer stuff they bring, or if you're looking to play them online with other people who also have said addons.  There's no drop-in support for people who don't have those modules.

I was at first afraid that the game would cost $40 or even $60 (as certain other companies *ahemSquareahem* do) for a remaster, but thankfully Beamdog decided that $20 made a lot more sense.  See you online sometime maybe!",1522648536,1522648536,True,4,0,0.492032617330551147,0,True,False,False

Q: If I already have NWN, what am I buying here?
A:

- A working server browser
- Enhanced modding tools
- Steam workshop support (goodbye and good riddance 2002-style modding)
- Minor graphical improvements
- If you pay a little extra, the ""premium modules"" that haven't been available to buy for many years

Q: How's NWN the game?
A:

- The multiplayer experience has always been about 99% of the value of NWN. None of the built-in SP campaigns are that good, and frankly it's just not a strong SP game, because you control one character and it's designed around being a real-time experience, rather than turn-based.

- NWN is basically RPG Maker for D&D, it has extremely powerful out-of-the-box modding tools, which have been made even more powerful by a die-hard faithful community.

- Every NWN server is like its own miniature MMO community, with its own mods, balance changes, theme, and flavor. Almost no servers play 100% vanilla. You can play on action-oriented server where everything is streamlined for you to constantly be in high fantasy combat, or a gritty server, where roleplaying is required, and you may spend hours gathering the mats for leather armor. Everything in-between those two extremes exists.

It's difficult to talk about balance in multiplayer, because the game is very different from server to server, ultimately catering to all tastes.

- It's a very faithful 3.0 (not 3.5) D&D adaptation. Most of what you can say about 3.0, for good or ill, also applies to NWN, though a lot's been streamlined to better serve the needs of an action-oriented video game. I could talk about balance here, but the exact balance is entirely up to the server you play on. If you know 3E well it's easy to get into, if you don't, there's a significant learning curve and a lot of complicated rules interactions, some of which differ from tabletop.

- What I described may not sound very accessible. I'll admit, I have rose-tinted glasses, and when I'm playing I'm using a lot of knowledge about the inner workings of the game that it took me a long time to accumulate. All of the time I spent learning was fun, though.

Q: If I'm just learning, what should I play? What's a ""safe"" class to learn?
A:

Very easy to learn the ropes on Fighter or Barbarian. Many servers put work into making straight fighting classes more attractive options for players, too (whereas casters usually reign supreme in tabletop).

Q: Any bugs?
A:

A few, some new, most old.

- Currently certain spells cause a framerate drop. That's new.

- Whirlwind Attack has always been bugged, in that it can break your ability to make normal attacks.

There are other longstanding engine bugs that I can't recall, off the top of my head, but few are as serious as the Whirlwind bug.

Back in 2003 when the game first came out, I was simply looking for another game to quench my insatiable thirst for another action RPG after Diablo 2. I had no idea what it was, and with my very limited understanding of english at the time of purchase, all I really had to go by with the box art. Needless to say, I was rather disappointed. So much reading, so little hacking and slashing. 

Fast forward a few years later, a friend pokes me on IRC and asks if I have NWN. And sure I do. He then introduces me to a Danish RP server(My native language) and shows me the ropes. All the Do's and Don'ts of Roleplay. I never looked back since. When WoW came out, the server I used to play on died out and it took several years before my eventual return. My English language had since then improved a whole lot, thanks to WoW, and I was happy to endulge in a new adventure on one of the packed RP servers that was, and still IS running with a healthy player pool. This game has the capacity to be one of the most amazing RP experiences any PC game has to offer, due to the amazing Aurora toolset that makes you able to create an entire world as you see fit. With carefully handcrafted NPC's, stats, loot, triggers, events and most importantly; the ability to log onto your server as a DM and create real-time events on the spot for people to enjoy. 

Spawn a horde of zombies to invade a town where people are RP'ing, or a dragon, or whatever you can think of. Help a player out with his own event, by adding atmospheric lighting, smoke, monsters and sound effects. You can think of it? Then it can most likely be done.

The singler-player part of the game is nothing extraordinary. It's a solid oldschool RPG, with a pretty straight forward story. Nothing great, but it does the job. I'd suggest anyone to buy this game, if they are even the slightest bit interested in role playing though. And with this new enhanced edition and the support of the steam workshop, I am totally looking forward to seeing new, as well as old amazing mods for this brilliant game.

There is something for everyone, my personal focus of interest is the Badlands server (Guild based PVP, with quality PVE dungeons and bosses, endless character builds, really interesting weapons, regular events both pvp and pve, and I could go on forever haha)

Anyway this is literally the best 20 Euro you can spend, there are servers for everyone (cooperative PVE, RP, single play content etc etc). For the cost of one night out you get a game that has captivated its community for 2 decades without fail.

Old players will enjoy it. No doubt. It's NWN. 

I expected a little more. Still, I trust Beamdog will keep bringing further improvements. They've shown to be capable to do so and are listening to the community feedback and ideas (You don't see many companies doing that. +1 for Beamdog).

I don't feel disappointed with my NWN:EE experience, but I expected to see the game beeing more attractive for new players. In my opinion, the game in its current state is relying heavily on nostalgia and is not attractive enough for a whole new generation of players, potential modders and content creators, who help increase the lifespan of the game and community size. 

NWN didn't age well. Improvements such as compatibility fixes, bug fixes, multiplayer via Steam, workshop compatibility (+2 for Beamdog), and many other features are surely great, but unfortunately it might still drive away many new players while it's tied to its 2000ish looks.

Don't get me wrong, though. NWN wasn't about graphics back then. Won't be now. 
NWN is about player freedom, vast amounts of community content, and it's probably the best D&D adaptation you will ever see. However, you must draw the line somewhere. Many key elements (characters and monsters models for example) need to be upgraded to something ""time-proof"" if this is to become a modern-day NWN game looking to attract new players and build a strong community again.

Old NWN players don't need to read positive reviews to be convinced to buy. They know what they are buying and what NWN is.
Newcomers might be disappointed with it in its current state. I'll say it again: NWN is not about graphics, but you must draw the line somewhere.

Back in the mid nineties, it was a part of the goldbox set, an online adventure where people could form societies, guilds, and play a digitized version of dungeons and dragons with each other.  It was grand and intoxicating in its brilliance (For the time.).

After Bioware's Infinity Engine ran its course, the company began work on this game I'm reviewing.  A game where the focus and main draw was the building of virtual worlds.  A thing that had occupied the realm of the professional game designer and serious hobbyist running an Ultima Online Shard or MUD.  Now, any joe blow could host a game that could house dozens of players at a time, seeing their vision in full spectrum and blocky polygons on their computer screen.

For most players, the dream was enough to buy in.  And what you got with Neverwinter Nights 2002 or 2018, is a huge amount of adventures in various settings, whatever their creator dreams up.  Some are phenomenal, many are just plain good.  Most are probably forgettable garbage.  But what remains after all of these adventures run their course, is the promise of more.

Now comes the renewal of Neverwinter Nights, and the bringing of the game into a new generation of computers and pcs (Although the old version works just fine on many set-ups.  Your mileage may vary.).  You can make all the half-informed accusations toward Beamdog for saying that this game is just a copy paste from 2002, or that they barely did anything.  Whatever.

Even if all that were true, what you're getting here, what the Neverwinter Nights community is getting here, is a chance at a new lease on it's lifecycle.  The power of Steam, the Beamdog Network, and the Workshop to make it even more accessible to everybody.

If you never liked Neverwinter Nights or the style of play it brings (Kinda RTS styled in the way it handles, and slow at the beginning.), you likely won't find this worth a buy.  I'd suggest people who already own the original and already have a server they enjoy, to stick with their current version, at least until the prognosis for this iteration is certain to be good.

If you're a diehard Neverwinter Nights player, I don't think you can go wrong here.  For better or worse, this new Enhanced Version, for all its faults or merits, is the future of the game.",1522530107,1522530107,True,9,0,0.557686567306518555,0,True,False,False

What they basically did is made the game to run on bigger resolutions. That’s it! The textures are bad and the UI, videos and intros do not scale to the modern resolutions! I run everything at full in terms of graphics and I got some stuttering with a i7 4790K, GeForce GTX 1080, 32GB of RAM and SSD drives only!

I only lasted 15 minutes before I requested for a refund…  Deeply disappointed as I was expecting an Enhanced Edition, but I got a bad high resolution support patch!

HOWEVER! This is a lukewarm recommendation at best, bordering on a Thumbs Down due to a very annoying  and potentially game-breaking issue.

If you, like several million other people, use Avast Free Antivirus or Avast Premium, you will have trouble with the game's saving. Upon doing so, either quicksave or manual saving, the game will crash and all your progress is immediately lost. The only workaround is to add several potentially vulnerable exceptions to your antivirus (free version) or entirely shut off the antivirus (premium).

This kind of thing should not be necessary in a legally purchased game, no matter how old. It is also the only game I've ever experienced this sort of thing with. Because of this, I urge anyone to consider if it is an annoyance they can live with before investing in the game. Given how fast you can die from a trap or an unfortunate critical hit, it may sour the experience entirely for many people. Not to mention users of other antivirus versions such as AVG also have similar issues.

A lesser problem is that the UI and all game windows seem to resize themselves whenever the game is closed or a saved game is loaded. Not game-breaking, but a little bit annoying considering how little control you have over the UI overall apart from resizing.

With all that said, the game is still incredibly fun and a reminder of simpler, better times in the world of RPG's. (As well as a grim reminder of just how far Bioware has fallen from grace in every possible regard).

The UI scaling is absolute garbage. Sure, it can ""scale"" up, but it covers the ENTIRE screen. I can't play at 1080p because the only two options for the UI are far too small and stupidly gigantic and blurry as all hell. When I say blurry, I mean BLURRY. What they call scaling really means upping the percentage scale size of the images from the original instead of a higher resolution. For example, the portrait is bigger in the higher scaling option, but your character's face is blurry and not detailed. The quick bar is bigger (way too big), but the border and the images are blurry and jagged. 

The second issue, which by itself does not warrant a bad review, are the graphics. I have played thousands of hours into Diamond and the only difference I can tell between the two is the depth of field effect. Nobody asked for DOF. It makes an already aged game look even older.  Honestly, I expected god rays, better ambient occlusion, anything. Other than the DOF, there is hardly a difference. 

Third. I was disappointed that the sound and music did not get an overhaul. This was copied and pasted from the original with the exception of the main menu song. You will still experience static in certain areas and the sound in general is dated and lacks the crispness of other modern games.

All in all, Neverwinter Nights is a classic, but you are better off just buying the Diamond edition from GOG for 10 bucks and downloading a couple of graphic overhaul mods. What Beamdog did was absolutely shameful and they are screwing people out of money.

NWN1 was born out of a failed attempt on Bioware's part to create an mmorpg. It's technically a remake of an old mmorpg released back in the 90s. Development changed gears toward becoming a singleplayer rpg late into development, which resulted in the singleplayer campaign being very rushed. When the game released back in 2002, it wasn't very good. It was seen as a generic rpg that wasn't much compared to the likes of Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment. What Bioware did next though was a stroke of genius.

The game was structured around being a very complete tabletop D&D replacement. The game includes a very faithful recreation of D&D 3.0's rules. Its multiplayer allows you to team up or face off against players, including allowing you to play as a DM. And it included a toolset that let you create your own adventures.

This last point is why the game is any good today. After it's failure in 2002. The game exploded due to the toolset. There have been hundreds of fan adventures released for the game since then. Ranging from massive 30+ hour campaigns, recreations of classic D&D modules, randomly generated dungeons, and PVP centric arenas. The fan community has made the game into it's own beast, transforming it into the mmorpg that Bioware wanted via private servers to the spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. 

It is highly unlikely a game like Neverwinter Nights will ever be made again. The focus on user created content made very easily has been done before, but the focus on completely ignoring the developer made content in favor of user created has since never been done. Neverwinter Nights is less of a game and more a platform for people to make their own adventures from, and it comes highly recommended from me as a result.",1522258334,1522258521,True,6,0,0.516590714454650879,0,True,False,False

As for the game itself if you like D&D or Pathfinder you'll like Neverwinter Nights.

Cons:  The plot of the first campaign leaves one wanting for more and the one off mini stories like Witches Wake will make you at a loss for words as to why it wasn't given a conclusion.  The art is dated, but straight forward and to my personal liking (take it or leave it).

Pros:  The rules follow 3rd edition sets, pre 3.5, and with a little extra unique things tossed in on the side but it's a pretty faithful adaptation of D&D all the same.  If you're interested in a good story then I recomend the Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark campaigns.  Once you're done with campaigns or they don't float your boat the online community is still going strong with a library of modules and servers to join.

Want to contribute to rebuilding the multiplayer aspect of this game and it's god-teir community(Eventually when the large servers update anyways)? BUY THIS. BUY IT NOW. 

Short story long;
NOSTALGIA GOGGLES ENGAGED!
OKay first off if you're looking for a super up modern graphical take on the original game this is probably not for you.
HOWEVER; If you, like me, are absolutely losing your shit over the idea of restoring the golden days of NWN's online play then strap the *#$& in because that's what this is poised to do, and will (hopefully) do!

The base game itself is all fine and dandy, you get what? 300+ hours of an amazing RPG, not as polished as of yet but the Dev roadmap says shiny, fancy, new models are in the works, there's even examples of them out already. And it's all for a $20 price tag. You do the math on how much that's worth to you. 

Even if the Online stuff isn't up to snuff at the moment it will be in time. Lots of classic servers are working on being ported over in full. And that's a player issue, not the Dev's issue so please don't hold that kind of thing against the game as a whole.

+Excellent writing
The Hordes of the Underdark campaign, which is included in NWN:EE, has writing that is on par with Baldur's Gate II. The companion characters are amazingly written, and the interparty dialogue motivates you to play multiple times with different companion choices.

+High quality community modules
Many of the community-made modules are extremely fun. Many have writing that is also on par with Baldur's Gate II. Just to name a few:

Dreamcatcher by Adam Miller
Tales of Arterra by Kevin Chan
The Hex Coda (and other series) by Stefan Gagne

These series are available free from the community, and each one is a complete single-player RPG experience. Excellent and immersive storytelling.

+Niche community modules, too
There are portions of the community that are wholesome and great for general audiences and anyone who loves D&D. There are also portions of the community that produce content that is inappropriate for children. Read the spoiler text if you're an adult and are interested in that:

[spoiler] You can find good smutty modules as well as good modules with smut. If you are an adult that likes adult-themed content but want it with an ACTUAL good RPG experience, then don't worry. You're not the only one.[/spoiler]

*WARNING*
Steam Workshop may solve this problem going forward, but downloading community-made modules can be a bit of a pain. It could be a bother learning where to put certain files and folders just to get a mod working.",1522208971,1522209359,True,1,0,0.500986754894256592,0,True,False,False

And this ties directly on what I think is the highlight of NWN, and something that no other game has ever achieved: the Aurora Toolset. It's a fantastic tool to create ""modules"" - those might be single player adventures, multiplayer hack'n'slash dungeon crawls, adventures that require a DM, persistent worlds focused in action, roleplaying persistent worlds... well, anything. 

It's extremely easy to use, anyone can put something together without issues. But it's also extremely powerful for those that want to dig a bit deeper. It allows for programming, and much of the game basic functionality is exposed to scripts (like the AI, the spells, etc). Scripts can be tied to objects (be them creatures, placeholders, triggers, or something else) and to events like OnSpawn, OnDie, OnHeartbeat (an update method that occours every 6 seconds). Every object can also have local variables stored on it.

This opens the door for infinite possibilities, from small details to large ambitious stuff:

- Want to have a goblin that looks like it's permanently frozen? No problem, apply a script on his OnSpawn event that gives him a permanent undispellable visual effect, and you're done. You could do this to chairs or other stuff as well!
- Want to create a whole new survival system that requires players to eat, drink, rest, disables respawn, changes how wounds affect mobility, changes how long it takes to equip armor, etc? Sure, can do.
- Want to create your own MMO-Style crafting system, with progression and all that? Can also be done.

And that's just me talking from the point of viewer of a programmer. Because the Aurora Toolset also support ""hakpaks"" that are resources packs for other asset types, like custom 3D models, textures, sounds, and the like.

Seriously, in a way, the Aurora Toolset is kinda like a 3D RPG Maker with built-in multiplayer features.

If you have never had the chance to play through Neverwinter Nights, this is a game worth playing. While its graphics are a bit archaic, it is more than reasonable for a computer game adaptation of D&D. It doesn't suffer from many of the issues a lot of isometric games do thanks to a more free form camera, and the animations, while simplistic, are charming in their own regard. The depth and complexity of most CRPGs remain while still being quite easily accessible.

For those unfamiliar, Neverwinter Nights is the combination of three separate stories: The base game and 2 expansion packs. 

The base game follows your character as he battles The Wailing Death, a plague that has struck the city of Neverwinter. A cure was devised, but before it could be used, the ingredients were lost due to an attack on their holding facility. Act 1 primarily has you focusing on discovering where they have gone and getting them back... But during this, a much deeper conspiracy is uncovered, one that will test the faith of the characters and challenge them to battling an ancient foe of humanity.

The second is Shadows of Undrentide. Following an adventurer who's home and training facility is attacked, the adventurer sets out to uncover the source of the attack in the Anauroch Desert. There they will have to deal with the memories of the ancient Netherese Empire incarnate, the relics of the powerful magical society that was brought down by the hubris of one of their leaders name Karsus, 

The last and arguably greatest of them all is Hordes of the Underdark. Beginning as little more than a traveler in the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep, you are attacked by drow from below! You stand up to them and end up descending through the mad labyrinth of Undermountain, into the Underdark below, and perhaps, even to Hell itself... This campaign is also a high level one, beginning around level 15 or 18, and going well into the Epic levels, allowing you to play with really advanced characters and delve into high level prestige class builds.

This game is also an excellent introduction into the world of Forgotten Realms. While just a super popular setting at the time, as of 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons, it is now the official setting for D&D. As such, getting some idea of the history of Forgotten Realms through NWN is an excellent primer for any D&D experience in the base setting!",1522181233,1522181233,True,2,0,0.479836463928222656,0,True,False,False
