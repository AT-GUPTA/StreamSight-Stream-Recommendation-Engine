After completing both the campaign and its DLCs, I challenged myself by replaying them all in Authentic mode, providing an intense and satisfying experience. Additionally, I delved into Axis Invasion, aiming for over 400 kills, which proved to be exhilarating and occasionally nerve-wracking depending on the adversaries faced. However, after reaching 400 kills, I shifted my focus to multiplayer. As a newcomer to online gaming, I found myself pleasantly addicted, enjoying hours of entertainment and forging numerous new friendships. Team multiplayer proved to be particularly enjoyable, fostering camaraderie and social connections, despite occasional frustrations with players from other platforms who may not grasp issues like internet speeds and lag. No cross was great particularly for sniping and practice. I managed just over a hundred kills in this mode.

In March 2023, however, a new patch unfortunately detracted from the game's enjoyment as the sunlight became overwhelmingly intense, rendering players extremely vulnerable on certain parts of the map. While this may add to realism, it significantly impairs visibility, making gameplay frustrating.

Overall, Sniper Elite 5 remains a fantastic game, especially with the additional DLCs.

Spent enough time playing it. Played all the other games in the series before it. So yeah I am aware of a lot of people not liking the game. Compared to the previous entry Sniper Elite 4. But let me tell you. This is probably the best Sniper Elite game I've ever played. And yes there are some drawbacks to this game. But if I could rate this game based on just one level. That level would be the Mission 3 location. Beaumont-Saint-Denis. This is by far the best location I've ever played in any sniper game. It has the combination of sniping from a great distance to close-up sneaking. The verticality, the variety of environmental details. Extreme detail of the architecture. And everything else about this map feels mesmerizing. I would rate this map 10 out of 10. However, you will not like it if you go all gun blazing or play it on easier difficulties. Sniper Elite 5 is a bit different when it comes to infiltration. It's much more like a Metal Gear Solid or a Splinter Cell game. You may have to rely on sneaking a lot more than just sniping from a vantage point. Also, you may have to rely on stealth takedowns as well. All I can say is to enjoy this game fully. Play it on at least sharpshooter difficulty, and have patience. Don't go gun blazing. Wait for the perfect moment. And have an idea about the distance and the loudness of your gun. The different kinds of ammunition you can use for different situations. Like if a good amount of enemies are scattered close by, they'll hear your shots even if it's from a silenced pistol. In that case, you could switch to subsonic ammo, which makes your gun so quiet that they won't hear your shots unless they're very close to you. The same goes for enemies that are very far away. Sometimes your gun doesn't have enough muzzle velocity to travel the bullet so far without dropping a significant amount. In that case, you can use match rounds that have higher velocity. And many other ammunition options.  If you have a good understanding of your surroundings and your weapons. you can clear a whole level with just your pistol. About the online modes. I'd say the invasion mode is unique. I liked it. But to fully engage in the story mode without any disruption, I'd recommend turning the invasion mode off for your first playthrough, 

If I talk about things I didn't like. It's probably the reduced option for carrying explosives. Some explosives are even missing. No option to take down a tank like before from afar. In most cases, you need to get close to a tank to destroy it. It takes two panzerfaust, or one satchel charge, and a bunch of TNT. Or a couple of well-placed armor-piercing shots on the back of the exhaust. Some maps have a lot of tanks, but not many options to neutralize them. Also, the removal of lure stones is one other thing I disliked, Though it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Cause there are a bunch of other options like bottles and lure mines. And of course, the way they limit you by putting invisible walls or objects that are seemingly easily traversable. But I got used to it soon. Would have been a much nicer experience for the big maps if they didn't have these barriers.
And finally, I rate this game 8/10.",1708485238,1708485559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It comes down to in what essence this game is. Despite its name of sniper Elite, It focuses more on special operations like sabotage. With this instalment of the series this is essentially a stealth infiltration game. Clearing levels is in some way more alike to Farcry where you sneak around, silently killing enemies and disabling alarms. 

Now if that's what your after you will enjoy this game It does those things very well. My issue is it actually presents few opportunities to actually engage in sniping as a sniper would. Most enemies are engaged at CQ or within 50-100M.  You will rarely ever need to adjust the dialled in range of your rifle at those ranges. absent too is information on the weapons bullet trajectory/drop and Windage info. 

The other issue when you actually fire off the sniper rifle is the noise it creates. (i'm aware guns create noise i'm speaking purely from a game mechanics perspective) Being that this is a stealth game that means any large noise will attract mindless droves of NPCS on your position. To counter this the game creates opportunity for you to sneak around camps, sabotaging vehicles and other objects to create noise so you can get a round off without triggering a mass NPC rush to your position. Once again to engage such targets at 50-100m max,

To reiterate if that seems interesting to you then by all means hop in here. As far as an actual Sniper game or simulator yeah its just not there. It would have been more interesting to me if they had created levels where you could actually be deployed how a sniper would have. The depiction here is more akin to a one man army Rambo or commando operations.

It does offer new additions (non-lethal approaches, weapon customization), but in exchange some of the previous features have been restricted or reduced (for example, few enemies can be exploded with a grenade shot).

The maps are more restrictive and appear to be more linear than before. However, they are still gorgeous and are fun playgrounds of mayhem.

Storywise, it's... just not important. You're not here for the story, but the main villian is about as threatening as a kitten and it all feels somehow forced in a way SE 4 didn't.

SMGが相応に強力なのはこれのためかと勘ぐるほどだが、肝心のスナの出番が減るレベルなのはどうなのかと。

対装甲戦もなんとも言えない仕様で、前作のようにのぞき窓撃ったり、
無限サッチェルで爆破したりが出来ないので、ステージ上においてただただ邪魔でしかない存在。

まあ悪いところばかりではなく、銃のカスタマイズはまあまあ楽しい。
どんな銃もアップグレードすればスニーク仕様にできたりするのは新しいと思う。
そのスニークが微妙な仕様なのが悲しいが。

ただその銃のアップグレード、条件がワークベンチのロケートというのはどうなのかと思う。
ロケーションググらずにコンプするの無理じゃないか？要は分かりにくい。

分かりにくいといえばミッション目標もまあまあ分かりづらく、もう少し親切な仕様でも良かったのではないか。

まとめると個人的にはスニークが残念になったのが悲しかった。
サプ付きSMGやサイト/サプ付きピストルで良い感じにアホなAIでスニーク出来たら楽しかったのに。

まあ、あまり変わらないとDLCとか言われちゃうからしょうがないとは思うんだけどね。
次作ではまた4の感じで銃のカスタマイズを残すような仕様になってくれたら嬉しいが。

It's like ordering a burger at a new joint and getting a lukewarm patty with stale buns. It's not terrible, but it's not exactly blowing your socks off either. The graphics are decent, and the sniping mechanics still give you that satisfying crunch when you hit your mark. But the story feels like it's been recycled from the bargain bin, and the gameplay lacks that ""oomph"" factor that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  The level design feels a bit uninspired, and the AI can be frustratingly predictable at times. Overall, it's a middle-of-the-road experience that might scratch your itch for stealth action, but don't expect it to leave a lasting impression. It's not a bad game by any means, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably enjoy it enough to give it a go, but don't expect anything groundbreaking here.

Multiplayer has its flaws too, like spawnpoints, where you spawn at the edge of the map, open from every single angle without a single place to hide, and no spawn protection, you spawn on a mine - dead. Ping is a huge problem too, and you cannot even know your exact ping, its just always shows full 4 bars.. enemies kill you before they even appear on your screen flying through the map at twice the speed spraying with an smg..

The positive reviews I can only assume are from fanboys with blinkers on.

I've been with SE since the 1st instalment, and have watched it grow and mature over the years. SE4 was amazing - brilliant maps, storyline,gameplay, challenges, AI and stealth. You could almost roam freely and use so many areas of cover it made the game a really enjoyable experience. Gunplay in SE4 was solid and consistent.


So when SE5 was teased I was really excited.......Until i read the reviews, and watched the gameplay videos....I waited for it to be on sale, as I wasn't going to spend over £50 on a game that sounded like another overhyped drag like Cyberpunk...and that was a soul destroying piece of crap.

I'm glad I waited - What a trashy, half baked, poorly optimised, crappy sequel. SE5 is yet ANOTHER prime example of a studio loosing integrity on a long running solid product and aiming at milking the franchise. Good god - the ***king DLC paywall - WHAT THE HELL????


Where do i start ?
Cons:
Crap gunplay.
Laughable weapons ""upgrades"" via the dumbass workbenches. They make pretty much NO difference to gunplay AT ALL.
Crap stealth - enemies can see you through doors and walls. AND THEY CLIP INTO THEM !
Crap maps - like REALLY crap. Object assets acting as hard barriers, walls you CAN'T 
CLIMB OVER - but only find out when you're trying to sneak past an NPC ! The maps fall way short of SE4.
Maps are TINY.
Environment Objects that get in your way - you can't walk over random rubble/boxes/broken beams/fauna.
Yeah they're pretty - but you can't polish a turd.
Remember you could knock out lights with a pistol or rifle and make things DARK .... not anymore. In many cases I would offload a whole mag at close range into a wall light and it stood firm. other lights I managed to take out made things murky...but I still got spotted by bionic AI.
Dark isn't Dark.
STUPID use of the ""non lethal"" mines - like WTF ? Where are the trips and S-mines ??
Even WORSE ""Upgrade"" tree for player and weapons.
THERE IS NEXT TO NO REAL STEALTH in SE5 - unlike all the other sequels, where you could actually hide and sneak about.
NPCs with super acute hearing.
CRAP visuals, even on the highest settings it's like playing in a cartoon - the cut scenes are a joke.
The maps aren't as ""open"" as you'd expect them to be - especially when you need to sneak.
""Surprising"" a jager with melee ... good luck with that.
If you're searching a corpse and an NPC rounds on you...you can't just break the search and swing around to take them out.
I didn't bother trying to do stealth attacks on most levels as it was just too easy to grab a machine gun and go blazing in. It had pretty much the same gameplay if I went in with a soft approach.
Pros:
ummmmmmmm..... game didn't last too long, i finished it in less than 30 hrs with no effort at all, so didn't spend too long yelling at the screen and bullshit game mechanics.

My largest complaint is level design. Previous Sniper elite titles put you through a linear map with many alternate routes and ways to accomplish your objective. As the franchise has expanded the maps have become more open as time has gone on and this has supremely weakened what made the game entertaining to me.

now in 5 all the maps are just big areas with no real pattern or direction to them, it feels aimless and not helped by the absolutely brain dead AI.
I think this is a side effect of the game leaning heavily into its online side with invasions and coop being expected rather than any kind of special mode for it like previous games did, basically the devs want their cake and to eat it too at the cost of narrative feel.

Other mechanics still work pretty well though again i think they were better in 4 and 3.

Picture this: Sun-drenched French beaches, quaint seaside villages, and the satisfying crack of a bullet connecting with a Nazi skull. No, it's not a Tarantino fever dream, it's Sniper Elite 5, a game where precision sniping meets explosive carnage and history gets a healthy dose of Hollywood.

Let's dissect this bad boy:

Vive la France! (With a Few Bullet Holes): The French countryside is stunningly rendered, from sprawling salt marshes to towering cliffs. But like a baguette left out in the sun, some parts get a little stale. Repetitive textures and generic towns can dampen the initial awe.

The Art of the Kill Shot: Lining up that perfect long-range headshot is pure dopamine gold. Wind whispers secrets in your ear, gravity plays its cruel hand, and that visceral thump of a bullet finding its mark is like a symphony for your trigger finger. The X-ray kill cam? Well, let's just say it's not for the faint of heart, but undeniably gruesomely fascinating.

Stealth or Rambo? You Decide: You're not just a walking gun turret, Agent Fairburne. You can stalk enemies like a shadow, utilizing silenced pistols and takedowns for a clean kill. Or, if subtlety isn't your forte, unleash your inner John Wick with a hail of bullets. The choice is yours, though the AI can be as predictable as a mime at a birthday party, making the stealth approach sometimes less than thrilling.

Open World…Open Questions: The sprawling map allows for exploration, but like a plate of overcooked fries, it can start to feel greasy after a while. Repetitive side missions and fetch quests can make you yearn for more depth.

Verdict: Sniper Elite 5 is a mixed bag of French fries and exploding innards. The core sniping gameplay is top-notch, offering a unique blend of challenge and satisfaction. But technical hiccups, repetitive elements, and a forgettable story hold it back from being a truly memorable experience. Still, if you crave long-range kills, X-ray-induced nightmares, and a chance to rewrite history with a sniper rifle, there's fun to be had here. Just don't expect a Michelin-starred meal.

Now go forth, OSS operatives, and liberate France one bullet at a time. Just remember, sometimes the quietest approach is the most satisfyingly explosive.

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - A solid sniping experience with a few burnt fries on the side.

Bonus Round:

The weapon customization is deep and satisfying, allowing you to tailor your rifle to your preferred killing style.
The multiplayer modes offer some fun diversions, from co-op infiltration to competitive deathmatches.
Don't underestimate the power of a well-placed trap. Those Nazis won't know what hit them (literally).
I hope this review helps you decide if Sniper Elite 5 is worth your time and bullets. Remember, everyone has their own taste in French fries and exploding Nazis, so take my words with a grain of salt (and maybe a dash of pepper) and see for yourself!

P.S. Big props to my AI co-pilot, Bard, for reminding me that not everyone is a master of ballistics. They may not be able to hit a cow from a china shop, but their knowledge of World War 2 history is as sharp as a freshly oiled Luger. Plus, they saved me from using the phrase ""Nazi-popping"" even once. So yeah, give Bard some love too. Maybe a few extra terabytes of storage or a shiny new language upgrade. They deserve it.

Sniper Elite 5 isn't without its flaws. The AI can be a bit inconsistent, and the game's pacing can feel a bit slow at times. However, these issues are outweighed by the game's strengths, which include its rewarding gameplay loop, engaging story, and stunning visuals.

It's 4 with new maps. Although the maps are big, they are riddled with invisible walls, which gets pretty infuriating after a while. One great addition is the unlocking of two more infiltration points on each map, which definitely adds to the replay value.

I've played it through twice now, mainly because I didn't take the achievements - especially the weapon related ones - into account on my first playthrough. So now I'm just farming kills. 

For a game about snipers, there are surprisingly few long shots to be made. Most are mid-range (<100m). It's not that it's difficult to score headshots for the rifle mastery medals - Nazis heads are like bullet sponges - it's that a lot of enemies are too close for the 100+ m requirement. It's says quite a lot that in order to get a rifle gold medal you need 50 kills, but for a secondary gold medal you need 150 (!) kills. The game is telling you that sniping is secondary. So anyway I started blasting.

One thing which has remained constant however, is the main character. He's a supposedly elite soldier who is in worse shape than I am, panting and wheezing after a five meter sprint. But at least the running animation is better than in the previous games. And there is something peculiar about a game released in 2022 where there isn't a jump button. Time and time again super soldier gets stumped if a curb happens to be more than two inches high. Clearly they blew their load on the kill cam function, but it's still strange how they seemingly disregarded just about everything else.

I bought it on sale and the DLC is only worth it for the maps. I personally don't care about skins, but the ones they give you are absolutely horrendous. It's like they were designed by a five year old on crack.

OK if you can find it on sale, but not worth getting a full price.",1705249745,1705907193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SE5 tends to be a downgrade from SE4. But I'll start with the one good thing SE5 did first:

[h1]Weapon customization[/h1]

SE5 adds a weapon customization system, you have to grind requirements for some of the parts and it's a bit tedious at times, but it's pretty cool. SE5 also adds different types of ammo (unfortunately you can only ever carry a very limited amount), including non-lethal rounds, which is very neat. 
I would say this customization system is the highlight of SE5, it's the main improvement it has to offer over SE4.

So now we can get on with the bad.

[h1]The movement[/h1]

The movement in SE5 is vastly inferior to SE4. I don't know why/how. Maybe Rebellion changed engine or needed to rework movement to allow for a feature and fucked it up. The result is, the movement will attempt to kill you. Ledges are the main culprit, they were never much of a problem in SE4, but in SE5, Karl will try to hang from every ledge or fence, so much so that you'll start to think that if Karl could hang from a stairs's steps, he would.

It's very much the running theme of SE5, you'll go around, try to jump over a fence or a wall that's 1 meter high, and Karl will somehow hang on it instead of jumping over it, leaving you to get shot in the butt. To help you picture how ridiculous is truly is, you can check this screenshot https://imgur.com/a/5yJi0VI

[h1]Tiger IIs, Tiger IIs, and Tiger IIs.[/h1]

In Sniper Elite 4, the tanks you'll most often see were Panzer IIIs. Maybe a Panzer IV (I'm not sure there even was a 4). Otherwise you'll find italian armored cars and german armored cars. That was variety enough I'd say.

In Sniper Elite 5, all you'll see is Tiger IIs, Tiger IIs and more Tiger IIs. More Tiger IIs than germany ever produced in real life. In Sniper Elite 4, you could kill the driver by shooting the driver port and the gunner by shooting the gunner port. You cannot here. The only way to do any damage to those Tiger IIs is with explosive devices or using an armor-piercing in the rear where the engine is.

The Tiger IIs in SE5 are so out of place that Rebellion even forgot to makeup blueprints for it. There are blueprints for the Tiger I scattered all over the game, in one of the missions, one of the side objectives is to take pictures of the Tiger II's blueprints - and instead you take pictures of the Tiger I's blueprints, because Rebellion didn't make the II's blueprints...
It's minor, but genuinely ridiculous and feels like something really went wrong during development.

[h1]The plot[/h1]

I'll be lenient on the main plot, I mean it's pretty stupid and silly, but germany at the time did many stupid and silly things, and Sniper Elite hasn't really been trying to be believeable. The plot of the DLC however is so terrible that I have to say something. This will be spoilered in case you care, but really it's so bad I don't think anyone would care if they were spoiled on it.
[spoiler]
One of the DLC is a continuation of ""Project Kraken"", except we are no longer talking about submarines, we are now just talking about a regular aircraft carrier being built in broad daylight IN NORTH-WEST FRANCE IN LATE 1944.

Karl is sent alone to stop the ""threat to the allies"" that is a singular aircraft carrier escorted by 3 submarines, a fleet so dreadful it would immediately be sunk upon trying to leave port. Karl is sent deep into enemy territory to stop this great threat, ""deep into enemy territory"" as in, IN THE MIDDLE OF ALLIED-CONTROLLED FRANCE, IN THE RANGE OF 100 ALLIED AIRFIELDS THAT COULD JUST GO BOMB THE DAMN CARRIER THAT IS, AGAIN, BEING BUILT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN AN OPEN-AIR DRYDOCK.
[/spoiler]

[h1]The common complaints[/h1]

Some of the collectibles are really tedious to obtain, some of the achievements are really tedious, that's not new to SE5.

[h1]End words[/h1]

Alright Rebellion, you can let Karl go now. Yes, Karl has been the face of the Sniper Elite franchise, but I don't think anyone particularly cares about him and you really don't need to have yourself be held back by him.

You can go set a Sniper Elite with a different protagonist in the pacific theater, you can do wild things, different things, or hey, you could have a Finnish sniper facing the red army (or have Karl fill that role, but why would you do that), what I'm saying is, you're allowed to do different things Rebellion. 

End note: I'm judging Rebellion's games by AAA standards despite them being a relatively small studio because they monetize their games like an AAA developer. (Stop that. Have some decency. Please?)",1705733655,1705888501,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is this a good game? Yes.

Is this the best Sniper Elite? I don’t think so.

My favorite to date is Sniper Elite 4, with the best balance of stealth, snipe, traps, infiltration, parkour…

I played Sniper Elite 5 in coop (two players doing the campaign). The game is solid, with very few bugs. It is very fun to be two snipers so we can cover each other. And this happens a lot of the time, because as soon as you get loud, the whole map (I am exaggerating, but you get the idea) will rush on your position.

You can customize weapons, but the way you unlock stuff is by completing challenges and finishing each mission. I don’t like that because first, you don’t know what the secret challenges are (if you don’t cheat by asking Internet), then there is the problem that the gear you are interested in will be unlocked in the last missions, and so you will not have much time to enjoy it… (at least for me who does not replay games).

The level design is not as good as in Sniper Elite 4: There are a lot of false calls, tempting you to climb a wall or something and you cannot do it because it is just a bit too tall, or just because the level designers decided that this is not the right place to do so…

All in all, this is a good game, but I would give it a 75% rating compared to Sniper Elite 4 (and maybe Sniper Elite 3). If you can buy everything, then go for it especially on sale. If you hesitate, buy just buy the 4 instead.",1704984256,1704984256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When it comes to the changes between Sniper Elite 4 and 5 in kill cam I did not notice much difference. Sniper Elite 5 has graphical bugs which haven't been fixed for long time such as no sniper reticle on the crosshair and blurry textures, despite setting it to ultra.

The graphics are great, the guns and ammo make it a good game, it's ALMOST like an open world, but you are still guided, but this is not a problem in the Sniper Elite games, as you can still get around to most places, it just takes longer as you can't traverse the hills and even in the first level, there are so many places you want to jump over railing and can't, you have to walk the long way around. Trivial I know, but gamers want shortcuts, we want to be able to hide everywhere, shoot out lights (which you can), and creep up on unsuspecting baddies and break their necks (yes, you can) oh yeah and talking of shooting lights, you can't do that in Far Cry 6 and in SE5, the mirrors work too, awesome :)  again in FC6, mirrors do not work; for shame UbiSoft, for shame! :) 

Ok, so the bad points, let's get them out of the way:
The music is crap, or at least on the first level it is, it's nice at first but it's the same loop over and over and over...... 
Collecting items, especially in a safe is an absolute nightmare if you don;t require the other items (bullets, mines etc), there were two instances where I could not collect the documents because I could not collect the other items, this needs fixing urgently, I must have wasted about 5 minutes at both locations just moving around as slight as I could to get the Y to highlight, well annoying! 
Lastly, (for now) the AI is crap in most parts, I shot soldiers next to other soldiers and they never responded, I had a guy tonight who was looking right at me and never saw me, well, until I shot him in the leg, then his marker went yellow, yes yellow, not RED, but chuffing yellow, even though I was stood right in front of him and I shot him  -wth???

Anyway, that's all for now, I'm only 8 hours in so I'll update this as I find good and bad in the game :) 

If you're going to buy it, do like I did and get it on sale, then it's not too bad if the AI are idiots :)

I've finished the game, I think this will be the last one I buy tbh! 
We need the world to be more like an open world, where we can climb and jump walls, too many times I try to jump a fence and it won't let me, it's painful tbh!

What I especially like, that I don't remember being the case in the earlier entries, is that the game actually shoves the DLC away in its own menu instead of being front-and-center in every menu option you see. From the inventory to the bonus stages, unless you actively go to seek out the DLC you're not going to see a bunch of locked-off options in your menu. After coming from Zombie Army 4, where 90% of the content was all DLC and just taunted you with how little content you owned for buying the game, Sniper Elite 5 gives you a healthy amount of stuff to unlock, and your inventory isn't cluttered with things you don't own just for buying the base game.
Dumb reason to give it a positive review, I know, but it was refreshing.

What I really don't like is the return of the ability to see enemy backstories by zooming in on them. For a game that markets itself as the game where you get to shoot Hitler in the balls, not only is that feature DLC (like it always is), but it takes the fun out of shooting Nazis in brutal ways when more then half of them are given sympathetic backstory text blurbs.",1704748080,1704763522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set during World War II, Sniper Elite 5 is the fifth entry to the Sniper Elite series of video games and features both a full 2 player cooperative campaign. This review will focus on the single player campaign played in cooperative mode. [/u]

[h3] TL;DR – Moving from one strength to another, Sniper Elite 5 is a progressive update of the Sniper Elite series and is easily the best to date with its huge levels and levels of freedom. [/h3]

Story (3/5) – Sniper Elite 5 takes place after the events of Sniper Elite 4 and is chronologically a year before the events of Sniper Elite V2. We are back with the titular sniper, Lieutenant Karl Fairburne, as he works his way through various parts of France and Germany to uncover the mysterious Nazi superweapon, “Operation Kraken”. While the overarching plot is interesting with plenty of lore bits along the way scattered in journals and posters, they merely act as a pre-tense to Sniper Elite 5’s gameplay loop of infiltrate, kill/blow up and exfiltrate. It’s neither overtly memorable nor, offensive in anyway which is perfectly fine. 

Controls (5/5) – Played with mouse and keyboard, Sniper Elite 5 adopts the same control scheme as the previous titles. The default key bindings are logical and easily accessible. Shooting feels natural and the option to adjust sensitivities really help to dial in aiming. Each action/key can be reconfigured to user’s preferences. Moreover, the use of a radial wheel to quickly access the various weapons, ammo types and gadgets make for very intuitive controls of the player’s otherwise very large arsenal.  

Gameplay (4/5) – Just like the games before it, Sniper Elite 5 features a large single map with a main objective and sub-objectives to be completed. How and in what order this is done, is entirely up to the player(s). Everything Sniper Elite 4 does well, 5 does better. Larger maps, more guns, improved traversal and stealth, more verticality, those are just the few improvements Rebellion has made. Stealth and sniping remain to be the core gameplay elements of the Sniper Elite series though, 5 makes it more acceptable than ever to simply go guns a blazing. This level of freedom in such a large playing field makes Sniper Elite 5 such a treat especially when played with a coop buddy. Points are docked for re-playability and some rather questionable enemy AI behaviours. 

Graphics (4/5) – Built on Rebellion’s in-house game engine, Asura, Sniper Elite 5 looks downright gorgeous from its incredibly detailed European castles and cottages to the spanning vistas and artillery shelled trenches. Excellent shadows and lighting also play a key role in bringing these large sets to live especially in the nighttime maps. The core art style and presentation does not differ much from the Sniper Elite series giving it an immediately recognizable feel and look that not many game franchises can claim to have these days. Almost a perfect score if not for the frequent graphical clipping issues encountered when interacting with enemy soldiers. 

Audio (4/5) – From the pop of each silenced gunshot to the boom of a large artillery round landing, the audio experience in Sniper Elite 5 is certainly a treat. Positional audio is serviceable for spotting enemy movements and gun shots. By far the best part is how the myriad of guns in the game have their own audio signature. 

Issues/Optimization – Sniper Elite 5 is very well optimized for the PC and ran well on my system. I had no issues running the game at 4K120 with most of the settings topped out. There were 1-2 hard crashes throughout my playthrough, but nothing serious otherwise. The most common bug you would probably encounter is a graphical one where dead enemies clip through terrain and rag doll in odd ways.

Overall (4/5) – Sniper Elite 5 builds upon all the strengths of Sniper Elite 4 and adds upon it with new gameplay elements that continues to make the game enjoyable. By far the biggest standout for me would be the huge, detailed maps which gives players so much freedom to tackle objectives in however way they see fit. Truly the best in series thus far and a benchmark for a game of this genre. If you can find a cooperative buddy to play this game with, it just makes it that much better. Highly recommended!

Higly coustomized guns and pistols. 
Toxic player base that keeps requesting more rifles and stuff found in previous sniper elite games.
Lots of bugs and connection issues (caused by unreasonble request for more ""catchmon"".)

The game was fun and brought a new way to play sniper elite.
But then all the demands and request from the player base ruined the game core.

Invasion was nerfed so it's no longer elite german jæger hunting karl. but karl hunting down german jæger.
Dlc nr.4 was change from special mission and a Derringer. To be a incomplete mission and the drilling shotgun from Sniper elite 4. (which caused major changes in the game core)
Steam forum is just as bad say something that go against the agenda of the SE4 mafia and you will be ignored or worse be hung out and made fun of.

If you enjoy single player gaming. The campaign is ok decent and fun just remember to set invasion to off.
Survival and pvp is great and fun but is full of all kinds of annoying players.

Survival has become what i feared it would be... Call of duty.
CP Equipment hoarding, hiding afk players, griefers, trolls, hackers.

14-09-2023
Survival is 1/4 pc players and 3/4 console players.
And of course lots of new players that have skiped past the campaign missions and played survival/pvp instead.

Lots of Rambos and leroy jenkins in survival.
And the stalkers who kill steals alot.   

28-10-2023
Ad encreased afk leacher players and Lemmings to the list.

23-11-2023
Large influx of new players and major exodus of older players.

04-12-2023
looks like most of new players dosn't like to ""grind"" their way through the campaign.
Which actualy is the best time saving way to lvl and get gun mods. 
But still some of the new players chose to skip the campaign and jump strait into the snake pit.

05-01-2024
The common type of player in survival:

The eternal noob.
- Somehow earned the rank lvl 40 and got access to all the perks. 
But dosn't spend the points to e.g. get extended hitpoints.
- Rush and dashes around to find easy pray and don't use cover when they are low on hitpoints. 
- Dosn't know how to survey and scout for enemies just keeps running and madly shoot at the first sight of enemies that is attacking. 
- Dosn't know the enemy types and tank/vehicle types. They just begin to blast bulllets when they see something unfriendly.

Rebellion has fixed many bugs. So, credit where due. 

I have played about 1478 hours, so I am going to update the review.

They have made few important improvements. I will list them down one by one.

1.	There are now 6 No Cross Maps which is ok but not good.
2.	There are now 8 No Cross Maps which is ok but not good. We had more maps in SE4.
3.	Lot of bugs have been fixed.
4.	Rest of the issues that I mentioned below are still there.

For me to give this gave 10/10 ratings, I have the following expectations.

1.	There should be at least 10 maps in both No Cross and Team Match.
2.	Introduce Dedicated Servers
3.	Give an option is enable/disable incapacitation.
4.	Give an option is enable/disable Focus mode.
5.	Ability to see game settings when you join.
6.	Capping of Prestige Level 4. You can’t go beyond that. Same is with other mode. You can’t go beyond a specific level.

Having said that, there have been no updates for quite some time. So, I guess Rebellion has stopped working on this.

If you are getting this game at a lower price, then definitely go for this.

REVIEW DATE: 4th Jun, 2022

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never give reviews of games early until and unless there is something drastically wrong with the game. This is one of those scenarios :(

Rebellion, what have you done to my favourite game? :(

Before I begin...

ABOUT ME: I started sniper elite with SE4. I have more than 4000 hours in that game with all 85 achievements.

WHO IS THIS REVIEW FOR: Hardcore Snipers who love SE4, the kind of campaigns it offers, The bullet drop and wind you get to play the different modes in. If you are a newbie, this review is not for you. Also, this review will not talk about bugs. Every game has bugs, so my review is not based on bugs this game has.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  OVERALL REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are from a country where you can get the deluxe edition for say 20 (USD/EUR) then go ahead and buy it! But if it is going to cost you 60-80(USD/EUR) then trust me it is not worth it. You will not be happy. I would recommend waiting for the sale and then buy it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- CAMPAIGN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I finished the campaign in Authentic mode very easily (Mind you with NO MANUAL SAVES!). It took me more than a month to do that in SE4. The authentic mode is a joke as compared to SE4. The AI is outright stupid. You can actually run from the front and stand behind them and they end up confused. Reminds me of the cadet mode in SE4.

Pros: 
1. The graphics is really good. Environmental photogrammetry has been put to good use I must say. Good job on this Rebellion.
2. Option to set Axis Invasion. Really loved this!
3. Achievement doesn’t port to other modes.

Cons: 
1. Authentic mode is a joke!
2. AI in Authentic mode behaves like AI of Hardcore mode of SE4
3. Weak story line
4. Unlike SE4, you have very less guns and Explosives. No S-Mines or Trips Mines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- MULTIPLAYER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
1. Ability to start your own games. With the absence of dedicated servers at least you can create your game and turn of the scope glint and aim assist which is by default ON is all servers :(
2. The introduction of accolades. I liked it! It is there in SE4 as well but here it is IN YOUR FACE, if I may say so.
3. Achievement doesn’t port to other modes.
4. Tagging a person now takes more time.

Cons:
1. I am horrified that there are only 2 No Cross Maps. SE4 has more NC maps and we got bored of them pretty soon. If no more maps are introduced for NC then seasoned NC players will very soon abandon this and go back to SE4.
2. Only 5 TDM maps.
3. Is it my imagination or there are fewer hiding spots in SE5 MP? And perhaps this is the reason why everyone is just running and gunning. Very few Sniping. Maybe because of Scope Glint, and revealing the last position of the sniper? People who run and gun will love this I guess but pro snipers will not
4. Need more maps! I got bored in 2 days.
5. Dot Shots, shoulder shooting and spinning still work as it did in SE4 which is really really sad and can cause lot of accusations.
6. Introduced a new focus mode. Users can press Left Alt to find the exact enemy position for about 16 meters. This is so wrong. Might as well allow hacks and cheats. There should be an ability to turn this off.
7. You cannot see the game settings when you join. Only the admin can see it. So, you have to join and that inquire if for example scope glint is on or not!
8. There is lot of stealing of kills. We should be able to switch off Incapacitation. When dedicated servers come, there will be lot of banning if stealing of kills is not stopped.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AXIS INVASION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A brilliant addition to SE5. I simply love it. Already completed 100 invasions! The only thing I have heard people complaining in discussion forums is that you can get kicked from there. I have personally not experienced it yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SURVIVAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
TBH, I have not played all survival maps, but I am liking it. Even the cadet mode is slightly difficult which is good! There are fewer hiding spots which makes the game interesting.

Cons:
My three biggest problem here is 

1. Soldiers in most cases do not die when they step on mines. I know I said I will not talk about bugs, but this spoiled my game play. I love playing survival!
2. AI in Authentic mode behaves like AI of Hardcore mode of SE4
3. In Authentic mode, you can see the white smudge (if I may call that) on the map which tells you from where the enemy is coming from.

All that Sniper Elite 5 had to do was recapture the formula of Sniper Elite 4 along with some refinements and that is precisely what it does. Sure, the AI could be better and the repetition does slow things down somewhat. However, who really cares about any of that when you can blow off a Nazi's testicles in a glorious high definition x-ray kill-cam? If nothing else, playing Sniper Elite 5 only proved to me that it is impossible to get bored of watching digital Nazis die in slow motion.

Personally I prefer 4 over 5 for many reasons, such as map design, better sound, better x-ray, more boots on the ground without absolute stupid weapon upgrades and a good authentic difficulty mode wich is way more hardcore to beat.

 we need to get a good combo for the 6th game or its just going to feel dated. that being said i fucking LOVED this game! i hope you include a multiplayer and invasion mode for the 6th its really the only reason ive played this one more then the others.

Getting a lot of fun out of Old Desert Ghost dying and still having the fortitude to continue on.  The fact that he whines a lot is good too, as I can tell him he's a hero for 'finding tall grass is a good place to hide'.  Just don't go inside a building the will see you always.

Update after 46 more hours: 
Still a NOPE from me. While the Co-op is fun, the controls feel bad and Carl feels bad. I don't know if it's the DRM that makes the game feel sluggish but I swear the controls feel more ""floaty"" than before, not as sharp. Something about the game feels wrong. A lot of invisible walls. Walls you think you can vault over, you cant. It's so frustrating. Graphics are a lot better, that I really like. Sniper Elite 4 just feels better.

You know the one: slow-mo x-ray cutscenes of Nazis getting fragged by your sniper. Shoot em in the head, in the balls, it's the same glorious result. 

Also, one big QoL improvement is that weapon upgrades are no longer tied to grindy ""Kill X number of nazis with a spoon"" challenges. The cosmetics still are, but weapon upgrades are now obtained by finding workbenches on the maps as you go. Rank system also means something now with a skill tree you can invest in.

Why?

Because stealth is not working as expected and has many errors and even bugs! Just look at the MGS5 with a supreme stealth mechanic! Just copy it and you cannot do anything wrong!

1.If you are in the field of view from enemies and you go prone and dont move, they still see you very fast and you have no change in many cases to hide because they realize you very fast(gras and camo, rims, elevations, distance has no effect!). so PRONING HAS NO FUNCTION in the context of stealth!
2.even if you go prone behind a bush, THEY SEE YOU THROUGH THE BUSH even if you cannot see them!
3.if you go prone behind objects and turn in this state the objects force you to stand up! FATAL! This should not happen!
4.they see you so fast in the red area, even if you dont move, far away, in bushes, behind objects, in gras, camo

So how it should be done?

1.if you are in the field of view of enemies, more far away and you go prone, they should check your last position if they are in yellow area before , but not shot instant! But if you go prone with camo in gras, they shouldnt realize you, especially in bushes and through bushes! And if you go prone and dont move at a certain distance, their bar of sight shouldnt go up any further.
2.please dont stand up while proning if you have contact with a object while moving!
3.if you are inside bushes, in good camo, in gras, they shouldnt even realize you at a certain distance (expect you shoot, run and dont crouch like standing upright)
4.if you prone and roll sideways this has no function like within MGS5, where you go out of sigh very fast and change position, because they search your last position. Here it is not working as expected!",1704035505,1704035505,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels like sniper elite has way too much sneaking and not enough sniping now

The furthest shot I have on record is like 140 feet and some change, the last game I remember hitting 300 feet shots literally in the first level,

The maps are really claustrophobic and the invasion system is just straight up not fun, it doesn't end up being sniper v. sniper, 

It becomes who can find eachother first and spray them down first in SMG fire, bc guess what, still no sniping points

And of course we have the paid hitler DLC for the fuqing hitler ball-shots because that didn't stop being funny 10 years ago,

- Great graphics (Beautiful looking game)
- Great sniper mechanics
- Axis invasion (new for SE5) is awesome
- Much improved weapons customization from SE4

Cons.
- Controls and movements are extremely buggy and really needs to be fixed in an update (seriously SE4 had much better controls)
- The maps are very restricted compared to SE4, one thing SE4 got right was its big open maps where you could approach the enemy from any direction you wanted and in which ever way you wanted, SE5 feels alot more restricted ....anything from a small bust to an OBVIOUSLY easy to climb fence can prevent you from progressing on to another area of the map, often resulting in you having to backtrack around to get to where you want to go..THIS IS ANNOYING! ..and this was not a problem in SE4.
- Another con is the extremely jerky and unpredictable movement of the NPCs.....one secound they will be facing right and the next millisecond they will be turned left and running left. Its looks unnatural and feels like a bug in the game.
- Latency from when you press the mouse to when the gun fires, its inconsistent, but its noticeable and often means you miss a shot.",1703955545,1703955545,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a variety of game modes, such as the campaign, PvP multiplayer, and survival. As an added bonus, if you enjoy hunting achievements like I do, this was a fairly easy game to 100%.

Campaign: I played through the campaign solo on the hardest difficulty as I like to take my time to explore and try to be as stealthy as possible, so I can't say how good the co-op is in this one. I thought the campaign was great, and you'll have even more missions if you get the DLC, and they are worth it in my opinion, especially on sale. The maps are huge, so you can tackle objectives in any order you like, and many objectives have several ways of completing them. Along the way you'll find collectibles and unlock weapons and mobs to customize them. The only real issue I had was the sniping opportunities, as I felt there weren't enough. To get gold medals for snipers, you must get headshots from at least 100m away with them, and I constantly found myself moving around and retreating in certain areas just to achieve that 100m distance. There is a lot of close quarters combat, which I also like, but I think there needs to be more vantage points for sniping.

PvP Multiplayer: I only played one round of this to get the achievement, but I didn't feel the desire to continue playing anymore than that. This isn't really the type of game I'd get for PvP matches. Aside from the base PvP modes, there is also invasion. Invasion allows you to enter someone's game as a German sniper or you can open yours for invading snipers. This adds a good challenge to your game if you find the AI is too easy.

Survival: This is a wave-based game mode where you must survive against 12 waves on enemies. There are a variety of survival missions on a variety of maps. The objective is to hold the command post, and after three waves, you'll unlock the next command post. You do not lose the match if you lose a post, but without them, you won't be able to access their resupply caches. I only played a few rounds of this, but it was quite fun and I recommend this mode if you're a fan of wave-based games.",1703793882,1703793882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rebellion didn't mess with the winning recipe; they just sprinkled in some extra spice. You know that saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? Well, Rebellion got the memo, and in the world of modern gaming, that's like finding a vegan at a barbecue – unexpected and refreshing.

The gameplay is tighter than my jeans after Thanksgiving dinner. Movement, weapons – it's like they've been on a CrossFit regimen. The AI got a facelift, too, but let's be real, it's a stealth game, not a Mensa meeting. Invasion Mode? That's the cherry on top – it's like playing hide and seek, but with bullets. And who doesn't love non-lethal options? I mean, sparing Nazis for XP is a bit like getting a participation trophy for world-saving, but hey, options are options.

The story? Yeah, it's there, like a background hum. Think John Wick – you're not here for Shakespeare; you're here for headshots. The multiplayer? It's a party!

Killcams? They've upgraded from a boring organ slideshow to a full-blown action movie. Bullet holes, blood spats – it's like Tarantino joined the dev team. Sure, I have a few gripes – like, why no destruction physics on character models? I want to blow a guy's jaw off and see the aftermath, not a pristine chin!

In a nutshell, this game might be the franchise's MVP. It's a must for Sniper Elite veterans, shooter enthusiasts, and stealth nerds. Go ahead, grab it – maybe throw in the DLC for good measure.

That's not to say that Sniper Elite 5 isn't enjoyable, but it does feel like Rebellion have taken a couple of baby steps forward, and a big leap backwards.

I really appreciated the inclusion of the weapon modification system and surprisingly loved the new campaign invasion mode; but outside these two additions, I found a lot of issues which really need to be addressed. The most frustrating of these problems has been the size of game updates, with single campaign or multiplayer map updates often requiring 30GB downloads, whether you've got access to the content or not. A fix was attempted, which failed miserably and stopped some players being able to launch the game at all. With the last campaign map of Season Pass 2 now out, it seems these updates won't be as frequent, but it simply hasn't been handled well.

The campaign is also strewn with issues: the story is generic, the threat the enemy poses is never well explained, Karl's commentary of situations and enemy intel is laughably poor, many of the maps feel rigid or restrictive, which in turn limits sniping opportunities, enemy AI is confusingly inept at the best of times, and the list goes on.

The game still has many positives which have carried over from Sniper Elite 4, but it should have been so much better. Rebellion had an absolute masterpiece to build on and haven't executed it well. I'm putting a thumbs up here, but with a caveat. Do not purchase this if you're looking for a successor to SE4, because this is a clear downgrade.

- less freedom in maps, you are basically funneled by invisible walls and impassable knee-high vegetation towards the objective;
- in most cases, the AI is retarded;
- the XRay cam feels downgraded : it does show a more detailed anatomy than SE4, but the bullet impact makes almost no damage to the bones / internal organs. Just a shower of particles superimposed on the mostly still intact anatomy.
- the cutscenes and characters lean so heavy on ""social justice"", it is beyond cringey. I won't go into further details, you'll see what i mean from the first mission, and the second will seal the deal. If that floats your boat, then you'll be fine.

I’d love to see something in the way of the Cold War, Vietnam, or even WW1. I also think the amount of content is almost criminal for the price. A couple more missions, skins, a pinch of new guns, and the same old “kill Hitler” mission. Why not a few missions centered around killing more members of the high-command? Why not a second story mode centered around training and fighting with tge French resistance? The selection of guns also bothers me; it’s so bare. It’s WW2, some of the most iconic weapons in history had there debut during this conflict. No M1 garand, no SVT-40, no Tokarev, no 1917 Enfield, no Volksgewehr; so much potential wasted that would’ve made the $150 complete edition price tag feel just a bit less conning.

> Gameplay: Its good, the movement is smooth but also direct.
Things i criticise are 
- you can´t drop of several edges, you can hang on (If normal ground is beneath you of course) this is annoying and could easily be changed
- some gaps between objects seem passable but just aren´t and it´s not possible climb or vault several walls/objects
- sometimes Karl doesn´t climb ladders, which forces the player to step upright and risk making noise

> Graphics: The look of the game is fitting and very detailed. With a decent graphics card it looks awesome.

> Content: The levels are large and diverse. Hidden paths provide plenty of options to play the maps. The same applys to the DLC levels.

> Story: I think the story is interesting and supports the change of scenery good. (As a German i can say the translation of dialogs is very good and i also like the conversations of the NPCs)

> Sound and Music: I like the music but i prever turning it of, because it gives me a more immersive experience. The sound works really good. You can identify the direction of voices and noise quick. 

> Innovations:
- The best new thing in SE5 is the Invasion-Mode. A second player can join the game of an other one and start hunting him as a german Sniper-Hunter. This adds new excitment because you don´t only play against NPCs with little intelligence.
- Now you can immensely customise your equipment. With many storeable loadouts for different gamemodes. Each weapon has about 20 different attachemants to choose from and you can adapt them to various play-styles.

>Price: About 100€ for the game + DLC levels on Steam is a lot for the average player. Rebellion also added a Pistol for 4€ what seems very odd and greedy as it provides no special perks for the player.

> Opinion: For me the price was totally worth it. I have played 15+ walktroughts and sometimes prepared a level to encounter and fight Sniper-Hunters (what is mostly kill certain enemys to identify the Invader faster and wait). For me its the most fun to play in difficulty hard and while invaded continue until the Invader is near you and them reverse hunt him. I have had some funny kills like predicting the Invaders movement and shoot rocket launcher 3 seconds early and perfeclty hit him or sneaking up behind them while they are looking for me with their binoculars. Many players complain about the X-Ray ability adn it should be nerfed because its to OP against Invaders. But have they ever tried playing properly ? I my case the Invaders sprint very much and so their movement is easy to identify with and without X-Ray and you can hear the noise they make really far.

And I'm glad I came to this game a little late as well, because a lot of the bugginess other people are reporting seems to have been fixed. Not completely, but it's definitely playable.

If you don't know what the Sniper Elite series is about, it's basically a WW2 sneaky-shooty-snipey type of deal with a lot of depth in its combat and stealth mechanics. The usual suspects like noise and sight, concealment and light and dark. Objects in the environment and map can provide sound-masking, to cover up the noise of your weapon, such as an artillery piece firing, planes firing overhead, generators you sabotage, and so on.

The AI is something praiseworthy. The average schmuck stands about and follows a set patrol route, as you'd expect. Alert them, though, and that's where the AI shows its depth. Enemies will take cover and triangulate your position from missed shots or watching their buddies get killed. The average soldier is indecisive and slow. Commanded by officers, they begin to exhibit more intelligence, spreading out and circling around you. In later levels, the elite soldiers that appear more frequently are absolutely vicious, pushing up using cover and suppressive fire, flanking you in the blink of an eye, and grenading anything they can't see. It really tests your understanding of the AI and your ability to use your surroundings.

Nothing particularly big has changed since #4. Most of the changes I'd say are quality-of-life and immersion improvements. Weapon customization is one of the best new features, letting you spec out every rifle / secondary / pistol for specific tasks, and it's good. Really good. Non-DLC weapons have all their customization options unlocked through side objectives rather than grinding out a challenge. The sound system is now more nuanced and some places have ambient noise that masks sprinting. It's much rarer for collectibles to be on random soldiers so there's less rifling through every single dead body that #4 was annoying about. You can't swap out your weapons except at a workbench but you can pick up every dropped enemy weapon as a temporary 4th weapon and with a perk take its ammo, so ammo is generally more plentiful. Oh yeah, and iron sights. I've been playing largely with iron sights on every weapon that allows them because it's so much fun and so immersive.

More so than in #4 as well, there's usually multiple ways to accomplish an objective. Stealth is usually more viable than going in guns blazing, but you could do the latter, if you're good at repositioning and snap shots.

Where Sniper Elite 5 really shines is in co-op. Having a buddy alongside you makes games infinitely more fun. Now you can plan out sequences to take out groups of guards, have two separate loadouts tailored to different engagement types, and flank the flankers. It's an incredible, incredible joy to play.

Edit:
Another thing I want to mention is the difficulty. There is a whole range of difficulty options that vastly change how the game is played, to the point where it can feel like an entirely different game. On its easiest setting, it's possible to mow down waves of enemies with a machine-gun, shoot out tanks with armor-piercing pistol rounds, and snipe enemies all the way across the map casually. On Authentic, the game turns into an absolutely brutal cat-and-mouse affair, with you being the hunted just as often as not. It's exhilarating in all the best ways.

I've only bought the base game and downloaded the free DLCs, and I'd say I easily got my money's worth. I can't speak to the paid DLCs, though I'll probably get them only when they're on sale.",1699731182,1702857639,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main problem with V2 was how often they forced you into close quarters combat. This one is ambitious but they ultimately fell short.

The sniping is solid, it's been the same pretty much the whole series. The X-Ray mode is still fun to take a long distance shot, track the bullet, and watch as it kills an enemy, dealing damage to whatever organ you hit. The maps are quite large but the game really forces you to try to sneak instead of snipe.

There are enemies practically everywhere and they hear everything. There aren't many levels with loud noises that can muffle your shots and everything you do is incredibly loud. Enemies hear you moving unless you move at a snail's pace but you can't always move very slowly because you'll get spotted by enemies that can see a long range. The worst part of the sound is there are times enemies shouldn't be able to hear you but still can. For example, there are vehicle patrols in certain maps. If you run 50 feet behind a loud motorcycle, the person on the motorcycle will stop because they hear you. For a game that focuses on ambient sound to muffle your actions, how do you not have that affect a loud motorcycle muffling your footsteps of all things?

The stealth can just be very frustrating and you feel forced to do it. There are certain areas where you can't crawl or you can't crouch and the game doesn't stop you from moving into those areas, it just forces you to stand up. The problem is now you're suddenly running when you expect to be crouch walking and everyone near you hears you, giving away your position. This particularly happened when I had to go under a bridge to disarm bombs. I had to reload my save multiple times because I would step in just the wrong spot, forcing me to stand and alerting all nearby guards. 

Furthermore, there are a lot of areas you think you can vault over but you can't. You'll take your time and the risk of moving through an open area to move towards some cover, with the plan to vault over some sand bags and flank the enemy, to find that you can't vault over these particular sandbags. It happens a lot and there are a lot of these small walls blocking paths you want to take.

​Since there are so many enemies practically everywhere, taking a shot with your sniper rifle will alert most guards and one of them will surely run to an alarm where you'll be left outnumbered and forced to reload your last save. The sniping is fun but you constantly feel punished for doing it and feel forced to move around, silently taking out guards with melee whenever possible. 

This is definitely not one of the better Sniper Elite games. Go play a different one. Hopefully if and when they make Sniper Elite 6, they'll go back more towards what made 3 & 4 feel so fun.",1702601735,1702601735,False,8,1,0.544759571552276611,0,True,False,False

2. Do not just try to shoot or kill everyone in your mission. You need not to. Just finish the mission where you need to sniping and need to kill. Do not just jump into your mission and shoot anyone. Plan your path and if there is anyone standing then snipe or melee them.

In my opinion I prefer the story in this one over SE4, but partly because this game was a lot more cinematic than the previous. The graphics are fantastic, and my favourite part is probably being able to customise your guns and shit, I must have spent a solid 20% of my total playtime in the testing range and analysing gun stats at a workbench XD my ass should not be allowed to cook at a game with any form of customisation.
I probably prefer the actual gameplay of SE4 more, but in this game, one of the big highlights is probably Axis Invasion, as it definitely freshens up the whole experience a lot (everyone has got to try it at least once, I promise it's fun).

The only real huge problem of this game is the cost for how much content you actually get, realistically, if you play through the whole campaign only and don't really spend time into customisation or exploring any of the extra objectives/collectables, you could probably beat all the campaign in 8 hours, and that's not even getting to the weapons, there's a huge lack of guns in comparison to SE4, and not even a shotgun in the base game!!! Trench gun comes in a free DLC luckily, but man if only the rest of the DLC didn't cost as much as the game itself. It really is a shame. But I do love this game so I'd definitely recommend it, and you should definitely get it when it's on sale. It's not exaaactly worth the full price when you compare it to the amount of content in the previous games.",1701805370,1702062888,True,10,0,0.608562171459197998,0,True,False,False

And right off the bat: They improved... A LOT.

This game is waaaaaaay better than V2 and V3. 
There are still some bugs and glitches. Also killing someone will trigger some sort of alerted state, but that just lasts not that long and it's easy to play around it. And that ofcourse is some sort of trade of: You either go punish the player really hard, which makes it a lot less enjoyable and casual OR you go the hard route and make it more realistic.

I do think they could do a bit more on that part. For example: When a body is found the enemy does a full sweep of the area which just lasts quite a bit and makes it so that you have to move around more and also have some smaller windows of oppertunities to move around without being seen.

Apart from those things, compared to V2 and V3, the latter I just couldn't finish, this game is really good. They finally did it proper with the stealth gameplay and you really can go around and do it like you want to. Also the maps are huge and well designed. They are really fun to play and explore. And if compared to V2 and V3 it's just a huge leap forward. Well done Rebellion :) Keep improving.",1702052673,1702052673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Found my purpose in life as a stealthy sniper (might have developed a slight obsession with long-range headshots)
- Became the unintentional hero of the resistance (seriously, every mission feels like a blockbuster movie)
- Built my own sniper's nest (though I'm pretty sure enemy soldiers keep finding it)
- Started an unofficial wildlife conservation effort (you'd be surprised how many critters you can avoid shooting)
- Discovered I have a knack for explosive traps (no big deal, just turning tanks into fireworks)
- Turned my sniper rifle into a work of art (they really hate it when you customize it with stickers and charms)
- Mastered the art of silent takedowns (who knew a knife could be so versatile?)
- Became a part-time demolitions expert (it's been a blast, literally)
- Joined the ""Bullet to the Head"" school of conflict resolution (who needs negotiations when you have a sniper rifle?)
- Explored every enemy-occupied territory (surely the next one won't have even tougher enemies)
- Became obsessed with collecting enemy hats (I swear it's for a personal collection)
- Took on the role of a one-man army (pro tip: always check your six)
- Engaged in the world's most intense sniper duels (Sniper Elite? More like Sniper-tastic!)
- Became a professional demolitionist (the pay is nonexistent, but watching things blow up is priceless)
- Triggered an entire base lockdown by shooting a single alarm (those Nazis sure don't like surprises)
- Carved a niche as a master saboteur (all those fuel dumps aren't going to blow themselves up)
- Woke up after a mission with an unexpected new ally (note to self: trust no one)
- Almost got captured behind enemy lines (oops, should've planned that escape route better)
- Developed a bond with fellow resistance fighters (we're all in this together)
- Died more times to surprise enemy ambushes than I care to admit (so much for being an elite sniper)
- Invented a new game: Spot the Sniper (the key is to stay unseen)
- Realized that being a sniper is just a gateway to becoming a guerilla warfare expert
- Mastered the art of relocating after each shot (it's like hide and seek with deadly consequences)
- Caused chaos in enemy ranks with well-placed shots (sorry, not sorry)
- Perfected my skills in long-distance engagements (it's all about patience and precision)
- Discovered that a life of sabotage can be quite rewarding (until you get caught)
- Became a part-time explosives expert (still working on not blowing myself up)
- Made a habit of collecting enemy intel (who needs safety when you have information?)
- Started a trend with my unique choice of sniper gear
- Accidentally alerted an entire garrison (one wrong move, and it's all over)
- Got a spotter who's worth their weight in gold (their eagle eyes are top-notch)
- Invested in the art of camouflage (they'll never see you coming)
- Became a certified expert in enemy patrol patterns (all those hours of observation really pay off)
- Found a glitch in enemy AI (why do they keep walking into my traps?)
- Took a perilous swim across enemy waters (spoiler: it's just really, really cold)
- Turned every enemy stronghold into a tactical playground (take that, Axis powers)
- Successfully sniped targets I couldn't even see (I swear, it was a lucky shot!)
- Managed to perfect the art of distraction (a well-thrown rock goes a long way)
- Ventured into enemy territory with nothing but a pistol (because sometimes, you just have to improvise)
- Learned to appreciate the quiet before the storm (the calm before each mission is oddly soothing)
- Unintentionally started a rebellion (those mission objectives can have unexpected consequences)
- Single-handedly shifted the course of the war (every mission feels like it has a real impact)
- Became an expert in historical weaponry (all those authentic guns and their details)
- Beat the odds in seemingly impossible missions (that one took a few retries, not gonna lie)
- Entered and escaped from the most heavily guarded fortresses (it's all in a day's work)
- Single-handedly reduced the enemy's ammunition stocks (every bullet counts)
- Started a support group for gamers who can't hit that long-range shot (we meet online on weekends)",1701760238,1701760238,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a stealth game now but it's not a good stealth game. The movement is clunky and enemies still have a whiff of that sniper elite omniscience. 

They added cusomization but took away almost all guns and added them as purchasable DLC. 

Invisible walls everywhere. Much more than in it's predecessor. It's like playing a half baked game from the early '00s

It's very buggy as well. The mission that the game is known for bugged out and Mr. AH disappeared into an other dimension. Other people reported this as well as early as 2022 and it still hasn't been fixed. Shame on Rebellion.

Plus the janky movement makes PvP aspect even worse than it should be, it's just juking in PvP no skill what so ever just run around in circles and pop shots with the triple barrel shotgun once you get close to them, I swear to god I'm playing The Division.

I love some of the new features, such as the Axis Invasion, First Person ADS, and the wide weapon selection. I heard some complaints about the DLCs and how much there is, but I am okay with this considering you get the game with plenty of content from the get go. 
However, I do feel there are some downgrades in some areas. First off the most annoying thing is Karl won't shut up. He talks the entire time while doing missions, and I liked how he was more silent in 3 and 4. This is a small gripe. My biggest gripe is there are some areas which you clearly should be able to access and if I was playing 4 I know I would have the ability to do so. It just feels rushed. There are definitely some areas which are downgrades. 
I wanted to love this game. It looked like Sniper Elite 4 with new features, new areas, and the option to play as the axis. It is like this  somewhat. I almost wish the Devs would add all the maps from 4 into 5, so I can experience these cool features on the much cooler map designs. 
In conclusion, this is a good game. It isn't great, or amazing. That would be Sniper Elite 4. If you are a Sniper Elite fan, and you have played the previous games I would say buying this game on sale is the way to go so you are not disappointed, which is what I did because I read some negative reviews.

The game's core mechanics remain unchanged from previous installments, but the new maps and missions provide a refreshing challenge for seasoned players.

The game's stealth mechanics are top-notch, encouraging players to carefully plan their approach and take out enemies silently. The X-ray kill cam remains a highlight, providing a gruesome yet satisfying reward for well-placed shots.

What I particularly enjoyed about Sniper Elite 5 is its relaxing pace. Unlike many action-packed shooters, Sniper Elite 5 allows players to take their time, carefully scouting out enemy positions and planning their next move. This makes for a more immersive and enjoyable experience.

However, the game isn't without its flaws. I initially experienced some motion sickness, but this was easily remedied by lowering the controller sensitivity settings. Additionally, there seems to be a disconnect between the gameplay and the cinematics. My character Karl was wearing a ghillie suit in the game, but he appeared in his default uniform during cutscenes. This created a jarring disconnect and felt like a programming oversight, especially for a game with a premium price tag.

Despite these minor issues, Sniper Elite 5 remains a solid stealth game with plenty to offer fans of the genre. The slow-paced gameplay, realistic environments, and satisfying stealth mechanics make it a worthwhile addition to the series.",1701359120,1701359120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And some disclosure here, I got the main game and some DLC on a hefty sale (around 40% off) so perhaps my cost to fun ratio is skewed more in its favor than some other reviewers. I have one big complaint that pops up in other reviews but mostly I'm seeing the same game here.

I'm not going to go do a point for point rehash for my Sniper Elite 4 review, which was pretty solid and a lot of what I said there holds true here. I say that 4 is just more of 3, and in some ways 5 here is just more of the last two.

In 4, I found the open maps to be rather exhausting after a while to the point where on many levels I ended up just going ""loud"" and whipping out my assault weapon just to speed things up so I could get to some new scenery. My experience with that here in 5 is more of a mixed bag. So far in 9 hours I haven't felt 'bored' by the maps. Enemy patrols are a bit tighter in some places, even clustered, so I spend more time methodically figuring out what I'd consider be a ""safe"" kill or not, typically considering patrol paths. Don't wanna kill a guy in a gazebo when I know he's got two buddies that wander around the courtyard and might find him. As a result I feel a lot more stealthy and methodical than I did in the previous entry.

My main, big complaint is just the level design.

I find a lot of the design here is a lot more railroad-y than before. The maps have barbed wire, gates, and tunnels that sort of force you down paths and bridges that leave you open to spotters and spawning car patrols. I'll elaborate more on that in a second but I had trouble exfiltrating during the first mission because there was a Y road crossing where I had to go that vehicles kept spawning and piling on top of each other because they'd be constantly ""alerted"" at my recent dealings there (an exploded car, maybe a body or two) so I had to deal with nearly a full platoon of guys because the game apparently just keeps spawning cars.

So I can't just pick a direction to approach my attack from. Honestly this is fairly realistic, during wartime it makes sense that you'd barb up some hills so any potential stealth teams have a harder time getting to you. I get that but I wish there were more options than ""you can only progress through this level by getting past this one bridge"". You can have your barbed wire while being a bit more clever with design.

The second level, an estate, is a real crapshow of design. It has the aforementioned three bridges but the real problem is that you're trying to navigate the estate itself. This isn't a problem for say, assassin's creed where most of the game is done with silent stabbings or a bamboo dart tosser. But here, each gun has a ""range"" of audibility. I have a DLC rifle where its range is pretty short but that 30 or so meters doesn't mean much when I'm trying to snipe at an estate. Once one guy goes down, one of the forty guys gets alerted and it starts a chain reaction that turns my entire minimap yellow and I just had to deal with that for several minutes. I let them wander towards my last known location where I then botch a shot and get forced into open combat, then my minimap is flooded with red because I now have 20 nazis gunning for me. My second run at this level was more successful but I did still have to gun down an entire hallway of six dudes before being able to get out of their sightlines and reset the encounter. I cannot imagine trying to attempt a pure stealth run of that level. There's no way.

That's not the only level where it's like this, either. It's just one of the first ones that made me think ""Oh, COME ON.""

Previous games had full on sniper nests, typically with a nearby sound masking generator you could kick to start a full sniper spree with, to clear out defensive structures in relative safety as long as you timed your shots right. That's basically gone here. Every now and then your minimap might denote a good spot to snipe from but I've found that generators seem randomly placed and are rarely useful to me. In the estate level there's a generator near the base of one of these towers and when I cleared the camp of enemies I got up and found absolutely no enemies at the edge of the estate to shoot at. So I just cleared the camp and was rewarded with a sound mask and tower with no visible enemies to take advantage of. Come on.

A minor complaint is that you're rewarded with more experience by going for non-lethal takedowns and keeping more Nazis alive or incompacitated. Why... why would I, or anyone, ever want to do that?

I get that this is two paragraphs of good and four of bad but considering the good points of the franchise are still present, it just seems to accentuate what really went wrong with the design. I'm enjoying it though and I'm yearning to play more of it as my Youtube recordings of it are processing in my video editor. Might do some co-op in it. So that's a pretty good sign if a game leaves me with that feeling of ""I want to see more"".

But yeah the practices around the DLC are pretty bad.",1701314153,1701314153,True,1,0,0.507804334163665771,0,True,False,False

Haven't yet figured out exactly how to customize the difficulty to my liking, and a few other such small things, but after playing the first 2 missions I can say I had fun.

Worst part so far is that dead bodies, vehicles, etc. just randomly disappear, even undamaged vehicles can randomly despawn when you're standing within 20 meters of them and just looking the other direction. Probably second worst part is that the AI cheats. Bushes etc. regularly obscure your visibility, but some enemy is busy shooting you through 7 trees and 15 large bushes as if they were not there.

There's other things that are less than perfect, rocks have been replaced with glass bottles, but nobody seems to ever hear them, even at pretty short distances. The only time I had someone react to one was when it accidentally hit their head.

The weapon customization seems nice, but I can't seem to be able to actually switch weapons .. I can pick up a panzerfaust, but if I want to put it on my back, it's just dropped on the ground instead (and the one time I tried that it fell through the ground into the void).

Maps seem reasonably large, but random areas are blocked off for no good reason, and the slightest incline on the side of a ditch is blocking you from climbing up and instead you can only slide down.

This game is so good in many ways, but also so terribly buggy and clearly rushed.. I kill literally everyone in the map, but it counts people I tagged with the binoculars anyway as ""spared"". Similarly I can tag the same person over and over again and get ""ribbons"" for ""tagging 20 enemies"". Probably because tags don't actually do anything on the difficulty I'm using.

There's the xray kill camera, which now has some speed controls .. they seem to do nothing.

There's regularly cases where I sneak behind an enemy that is crouching digging through trashes or something, and so I can't stealth kill them, the action option just isn't given to me, and then when I bump into them, they get up, stand in front of me, point a gun at me, and I just gotta wait keep tapping E hoping that at some point the stupid buggy thing will let me kill them before they can shoot me .. this goes on for multiple seconds.

The item highlighting is also incredibly flawed, it used to work great in SE4, but it's constantly refusing to highlight items for me to act on, or is constantly selecting the wrong thing. Particularly bad in a box that has like 5 items in it, trying to select the one thing you can pick up and want to is sometimes near impossible.

If you accidentally step too close to some hole, the character may decide to start hanging off the ledge, and then refuses to climb back up. There's hidden back entrances where e.g. you open a grate to go through, but due to bugs you can't always actually fit all the way through and so can't use them.

Doors require an action to open, which takes control away from you, and you can't close them.

Actions regularly animate poorly, and sometimes due to the animation glitching you just can't perform them - searching bodies in certain positions is impossible, throwing TNT doesn't always show the arc, and when you release the button he just tosses it in his feet, etc.

Still fun, but in its current state very flawed. Don't buy until the devs clean up their act and fix it - considering the amount of bugs I keep running into, it's months away from being really enjoyable.

One REALLY big minus - it attempts to force an unwanted multiplayer invasion system on you, and for that system, it attempts to force one of those rootkit DRM piece of trash cancerware things on you. It seems you can avoid this by checking the settings BEFORE launching the game, but it's far from obvious.

UPDATE: 1.5 years later, the game still has most of the same issues, there's a few less issues with clipping through the world or being blocked from a few areas you should be able to crawl through, that's it. All the other bugs and issues mentioned above are still valid. I keep regularly bumping into new bugs that have been reported long ago that the devs have completely ignored. Very disappointing behavior from the devs.",1653655527,1701194221,False,0,0,0.499440401792526245,0,True,False,False

Which is fine, but I find some the missions far too restrictive with pathways and routes you can take. There are a lot of fences and sandbags you should be able to vault over, there are so many fences that you can't vault over just to be a path blocker. The worst offenders are the little sheet metal piles on the train tracks on War Factory. Why are those there? Why can I not traverse them? Why does it seem like the devs made lanes and avenues and staircases with roof access on many buildings just to block it with a copy/paste debris? Vantage points are very few and far between imo. The game feels linear when each mission is touted as a sandbox.

I have always enjoyed the survival modes ever since SE2. In each installment it is easily the best part of the game. This game's survival mode is bland. The maps stink, there are very few vantage points. If there is a vantage point you can bet it has no sight lines to objective. That means if you're solo you have to sit on OBJ with your secondary or if you are in a group someone has to babysit OBJ while the others have fun sniping.

The weapons. I'm fine with the creative liberty Rebellion took in regard to weapon customization. It's not for me, I find it a little immersion breaking but for others I can understand if someone likes it. The ballistics seem to be overhauled which I like, no more shooting at an enemy who is at 100 meters and I'm zeroed for 50 meters and I'm shooting at his toes. Or being zeroed at 50 meters and my target is 30 meters and I'm shooting the sky behind him. Well done, it is a *little more realistic.* What I do not like about the weapons is lack of variety in base game. This has always been a Sniper Elite problem but Rebellion has shown they do not necessarily care for equipment being outside it's theater of war. Why not add in legacy weapons  from previous games locked behind challenges? 

The axis invasions and multiplayer are okay. I like the invasion system, gives the campaign a neat dynamic. 

This is nit picky but I cannot stand the sound track. SE4 had a pretty epic soundtrack, and the previous games had fine soundtrack. I had to turn the music off in this game. I have never turned off game music before in any other game. 

Overall the worst offense SE5 makes is monetization. The DLC packs. I think its pretty lame that there is like $250 of content you can buy. I feel really bad for those that bought deluxe with season pass thinking they would get all content.

I can't recommend a game that claims to be Sniper Elite but feels more like Hitman in WWII,and fails to execute either properly. This experience taught me the value of not preordering.

First of all, it's not a bad game and looks very good. However, I've played all the earlier Sniper Elite games and most of the Hitman franchise (which is more relevant than it might seem), and I find this one to be the least enjoyable among modern games.

[u]What I like:[/u]
In this installment, compared to the previous ones, I particularly like the [b]weapon customization[/b]. It allows you to dramatically alter how a weapon performs in some cases, and enables specialization of weapons for certain tasks or playstyles. Additionally, I also like the [b]graphics.[/b] While not necessarily better, the grittier atmosphere it creates suits the game quite well in my opinion.

[u]What I don't like:[/u]
Let's address the big issue first: [b]map design and the Hitman-like feel[/b]. The maps are expansive but, unlike Hitman, all paths feel constrained (sometimes oddly so). For three-quarters of the game, you're so close to the enemy that an SMG or a knife is more useful than a scoped rifle. The game introduces new options for killing like poisoning, and to top it off, it features the same hitman-o-vision from the Hitman series. The only difference is that it feels even more out of place here. All of this contributes to the game feeling more like a poorly executed Hitman set in WW2 rather than a proper Sniper Elite game.

[b]Grinding[/b]: If you want everything, be prepared to do a lot of grinding. If you want to do it in multiplayer, you'll have to do it all over again against other players who most likely already have the upgrades.

Speaking of [b]multiplayer[/b], the old-style multiplayer has been replaced with gameplay similar to CoD and Battlefield, but with everyone equipped with sniper rifles. I find that this style challenges less thinking and sniping, and leans more toward reflexes and bunny hopping.

[b]Multiple DLC seasons[/b]. call me old fashioned but i think this is bullshit, certainly at €30 for 2 maps, 2 guns, and some skins.

P.S. The best anti-tank weapon is an SMG with AP bullets.",1675118450,1700603477,False,2,0,0.511778473854064941,0,True,False,False

It is very fun in the first say 3-4 missions, but gets quite repetitive afterwards. There are so many aspects of this game that makes me wonder how is this game already the 5th in this series. Here are why

With everything pre-calculated for you in sniping, you just need to lock the red diamond box onto enemies' head. The bots are moving very rigidly according to the designed routes, where enemies would keep pacing around even if you triggered the alarm. The controls for climbing ladders are awfully designed, making it almost impossible to move immediately after climbing down a ladder. If you non-lethally subdue an enemy on a slope / stairs, they will fall into the ground and be deemed ""killed"". If you change your loadout, the ammunition selection will be reset, so every time you will have to redo all 3 weapons, which is another bummer.

I will say i don't think i got as many testicle shots as i was thinking i would of. Head-shots were my thing this time around. I enjoyed the new skill tree but felt that it could of offered more options with a higher rank count. This game was long but also short. The missions themselves granted if you play like a real sniper would they could take few hours to complete witch i liked but the amount of levels is short in main game I would of liked to see few more that i didn't have to pay for with DLC. At this point in my review i have not bought the DLC an for the price listed i probably will not. The online play was okay i really haven't played much of it just yet. The survival mode was pretty neat extra with 4 rounds at 4 different locations each game can take some time solo but was a nice challenge. Co-op im sure it is smooth an nice as the other games in the series were just that. Overall if you are a fan of the series this one you will enjoy hands down improvements everywhere.

SE4>SE5.

I'm disappointed that there's not much of an improvement from SE4 as I expected. except from slightly better graphics, new mechanics & 'Axis Invasion' mode. besides those three things, SE4 are way superior than SE5 in all aspects.

only get the game if you never played SE4, or if you are new to the Sniper Elite franchise.

if you already owned SE4, you wouldn't miss out much if you skipped SE5.

The game brings a few innovations to the fanchise however it falls short of it's predecessors especially regarding the quality of the maps and AI.
The maps could be better made, there are areas that seem accesible but are not and many bugs.
The AI is quite poor comparing to previous iterations of the game. Most notable is the fact that once the soldiers become cautios (yellow) they seem to be running around forever, including snipers. Also they sometimes remain in combat mode even after the character left the area by a significant distance (e.g., other side of the map)
The camera and angles around the main character are also very poor. While switching to binoculars and scoped weapons, most of the time you are no longer looking at the same angle as in the third person view. Also while aiming or looging through the binoculars over a parapet the character no longer raises his head, forcing you to stand up to see over.

The scenario could also be improved. For a sniping game there are too few opportunities to take long shots with the rifle. Instead, it is far more easy to complete the game using take-downs and fighting with your side arm and muffled SMG. This is due to the fact that the game requires you to actuate various valves and levers placed in vaious crowded places. This gets old very fast , and combined with the above-mentioned AI fault it is far more appealing to the player to try to sneak in and take down all opponents in hand to hand combat than to use the sniping option.

I wish the next iteration of the game would take the maps quality from SE3 and $E4, the AI and scenario from SE4 and the new featurs from SE5 (Pacify option, Loot boxes, Workbenches) and create a truly captivating game.

To conclude, I was very hyped by this game and waited to buy it on a Black Friday deal and still feel I paid too much for it.",1699695878,1699695878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stealth is very important in this game. I probably used my silenced pistol more than my sniper rifle, but that's OK as it made sense based on the situation. You can go in guns blazing in certain situations. The enemy spawns are not unlimited.

You can snipe more if you use sound sources and distance as your cover (different weapons are heard at different ranges - also quieter bullets are a nice option). Lots of difficulty options to suit your play style.

A few glitches using cover and picking up items, but nothing major. I do miss the trip wire trap as enemies can sneak up on you when you are focussed on frontal combat. 

I liked the various ammo/gun options (and of course bandages and med kits) but did not use most of the misc items in my play through (e.g. decoy, various mines, TNT). The glass bottles and whistle were useful though. Satchel charges are required but you pick them up as you go.

The DLC pricing is absolutely outrageous tho (currently 2 guns and 1 skin in a bundle on sale for 7.49€ , normal price 11€), they are really bad value-for-money and are much more aggressively priced than SE4 (half the content for twice the price in comparison) and so far the DLC content has not seen a sale that would go down to a price that i would be willing to pay for said DLCs (3-5€).

The whole game's story, from mission one, surrounds a thing called the Kraken. What's Kraken? DLC, what would be the obvious last or second to last mission is DLC. That tells me some scumbag is leeching off the game, and considering how much junk dlc there is, maybe many. It's really designed to make you buy dlc too. The one automatic pistol, dlc. There's no try before you buy or examination of what modifications you can use on these dlc weapons, so, they can sell you junk and you won't know it until you pay. It's just greasy crap like that that really bothers me when the lack of improvements to the series feels frustrating. 

Default controller sensitivity is fucked, and seems to be always fucked. The character is the clunkiest, stuck on every little thing. I got stuck on a ladder for 5 minutes, trapped between a wall and a hole that it wouldn't let me drop down, wouldn't side climb over to me grab a ladder (even tho my guy is touching it.) It's just sad. With all that said, it's basically just the same game as the last few with some added features... but I swear nothing was improved. It's all reuse, which is fine, if you reuse and improve. 

Another thing I have a problem with is the level design. Outta the 14 or so maps, 5 of which are DLC, I think I enjoyed 2 or 3, and that's because most of them are just cluster fucks, and again it's almost allllll reuse from the past 4+ games. You go into a lot of the buildings and it's like 100 doors you can't interact with, shooting off in hallways that run 5 directions, with sparsely open doors here and there, basically doom enemy closets. So, every door you come out, there's enemies to your left right front and back, but you can never determine which door or what direction they are... it's just unintuitive. It's a sniper game, and you end up running around in trench mazes and cluster bunkers, or big ships most of the time. Like I said, there's good maps too, but there's a lot bogged down with just, flat places with no good lines of sight on anything, with bushes acting as boundaries everywhere in the middle blocking line of sight and logical pathing to objectives, and the arbitrary obvious post you're supposed to use. Hey, that old empty windmill just beyond the perimeter of our top secret base, maybe we should hit it with a rocket real quick just incase ya know. ""No, it looks pretty.""

 Another thing I don't like, and I think it's cause of the price of this game, limiting who plays it to either A; people who get it on discount and are casual as hell, and B; the most hardcore of fans. This is a pretty bad combo. You wanna jump in, you jump into someone who has been camping for a half hour because they have an invade, you spawn in, instant death cause they have the difficulty jacked up. Or, you open your game up, and you get people who are just thirsty to kill the first person they can, they do it, alert everyone everywhere, then try to speed run, or they just leave after they set off all the alarms and get killed. Then there is the tacked on multiplayer modes, survival is standard and generally fun, but they have this whole upgrade leveling system for modes separate from survival and coop, unlocks tied to bs nonsense busy work, etc, and again, this game is filled with sweat... so sweat and forced multiplayer progression always makes a good combo. 

I've been wishing since like number 3 that this would just be a coop metal gear v, and they just keep making the same game. The clunkiness of the player tho is whats really frustrating, he's magnetized to a lot of stuff, and incredibly slow in some cases. Really slow crouch walk, realllly reallly slow walk while aiming, no matter what the weapon. Very slow crawl. These problems combined with the bad business, few inspired maps, and the fact that these games quickly loose player counts. I can't tell you how many times people love to shoot a guy you are currently melee killing. So, instead of the silent kill, where you get all the items, they alert the place to your position... just because they are salivating for a dopamine response. This happens a lot while sniping too, but it's more forgivable. Plus, it's one of those games keyboard and mouse players ""shift w"" the whole game, while at the same time controller x and y is all fucked up. These are all things that really should have been reworked like 3 games ago. 

I'd say get it on sale only, as cheap as possible, 10 or 15 bucks, and there's really maybe only 1 dlc worth a shit. Again think of this, if 99 percent of the content from this game was made from or just straight reuse from the other 4 or 5 games, why did you only gives us about 3 skins for the main character? Because you are almost purely relying on reuse to make the game, you may not actually even have any original artwork for this game? We are literally paying for things that were made idk a decade ago for a different game. Reuse is fine, literally every major company does it, but this dlc really feels pulled straight outta the actual game. How can you have a STEALTH game with a mad militant leader who is making a super weapon... and you end it before dealing with the superweapon. I can't get over how dumb that is. 

I actually checked the reviews on this, and a lot of people seem to acknowledge this problem, but I think a lot of people who are positive... first of all, they just don't know what they're talking about, probably prefer their cereal stale, and it's the first of this franchise that they've played. IDK, pretty insulting experience all around. Oh and my 26 hours... I've pretty much done everything I wanted to do twice already. I haven't grinded levels in multiplayer and I haven't searched for every collectible, and I won't do those things ever, because they are not really fun things to do. Oh yeah, when surrounded by nazis and all their junk I'm gunna make sure to keep an eye out for statues of eagles... That's like saying, here's a forest, it's your job to collect green leaves, and when you're done, go ahead and get the brown ones too.

I loved this game for a while. Axis Invasion was a hoot. Then I had to take a break of several months for medical issues. I was ready to get back into it and Season Pass 2 came out. Perfect, I'll pick it up and jump back into the game and ...

... never got the chance to play it. Unfortunately, the game (at least for me) is now completely broken. It will load, but only until it gets to the copyright screen. It hangs there and I have to kill the process via task manager.

I'm not new to PCs. I've used every version of Windows since 3.11. I've tried every single troubleshooting technique I've learned in that time on this game. Drivers? Up to date. Anti-virus? Off. Firewall? Off. Change every setting in the launcher? Done. Run as administrator? Doesn't work. Verify the files via Steam? Done that. DXDiag? Clean. 

Hardware - i9 12900, RTX3070, 64GB Ram. Not hurting on the system specs. Every other game I play works flawlessly and runs smoothly. Star Citizen, DCS, Cyberpunk, Hell Let Loose, etc. all run at high FPS with no problems.

I've submitted trouble tickets. The 1st one was in August. I understand they are a small company, so the long response times were not that big of deal. However, the support I've received has been nothing more than ""update your drivers and try other options in the launcher"". And because I gave Rebellion the benefit of the doubt  and waited for a support response, I exceeded the Steam refund timeline. I regret that now.

If you take a gamble, purchase this, and it works, you'll have a good time. But I'm now so frustrated that I doubt I'll ever buy another Sniper Elite title again.",1699132568,1699132568,False,1,0,0.502973675727844238,2,True,False,False

I tried to get a refund but that won't happen. there's 64.90 down the drain.  If you think yo want to buy it, think carefully. 

Update.... It's getting better, but it's taking a long time to do it. Some content doesn't make any sense.  Those weird skins for weapons aren't my cup of tea. Additional missions are a bit on the expensive side and too short. I'd still think carefully about getting it. I play it very little. I go back  to 4 and play that more than I do 5.

He doesn't use cringe-worthy or awkward dialogue that makes me cringe and drop the game. He's pretty cool, and I also like his attire. So, the main character gets a solid 9/10 from me.

I appreciate that there isn't a lengthy and complicated tutorial in the game. Instead, you have a short and straightforward tutorial before diving into the game. I give this aspect an 8/10 because overly complex and long tutorials can make a first-person shooter boring. However, I had a slight issue with not knowing how to heal initially. It might have been my mistake for missing it, but it would be helpful if the game explained which button to press for healing.

The variety of guns in the game is fantastic, and I like that the game explains their historical usage in a simple and concise manner. It's impressive, and I've learned about guns I never knew were used. The fact that guns can make different noises depending on their loudness adds depth to gameplay. So, this aspect gets a perfect 10/10.

I admire that Sniper Elite 5 includes elements that many other AAA games wouldn't dare to touch, unlike titles like Call of Duty. The game provides an authentic World War II experience, and even using terms like 'Nazi' and featuring the Nazi flag was surprising to me, as many games have avoided them since 2005. I appreciate that the game uses accurate terms like 'Fritz,' 'Heinies,' or 'Kraut.' It feels more genuine than generic labels like 'bad guys' or 'evil people.' This aspect deserves a 10/10 for its boldness and respect for historical accuracy.

Thank you for giving German voice actors a chance. It makes the characters feel genuinely German, unlike Ubisoft, who didn't use Swedish actors for Assassin's Creed Valhalla. This approach often results in incorrect pronunciations and disconnects from the culture. Kudos to Sniper Elite 5 for giving voice actors from the respective countries a chance, and I appreciate that effort. It makes me happy to see this attention to detail.

I also love how the soldiers' dialogue feels like it's meant for them, making the game feel more real and immersive. It's a subtle but important touch that adds to the overall experience.

Moreover, when you press 'B' to use your binoculars for scouting, and you can see their names and some personal information, it adds a layer of complexity to the game. Sometimes, it can make you feel conflicted about taking a shot, depending on what you've learned about them. It adds an emotional dimension to the gameplay that can be both engaging and thought-provoking.

Regarding bugs or lag, I purchased the game a bit late, so I can't comment on its early state. However, I didn't encounter any major bugs, just some minor issues like soldiers occasionally bunny hopping or having creepy, open mouths. So, I'd rate it 8/10 for the relatively smooth experience.

I like the game's map and how it creates an immersive environment that isn't empty. It's great that you can find items scattered around. However, I did notice that some areas are inexplicably blocked, which was a bit confusing. So, I'd give this aspect a 7/10.

The menu design is good; gray and blue colors work well, and it's simple and visually appealing. While it's not a big deal, it could be interesting to see different menu designs for various locations in the game. So, the menu gets an 8/10.

Overall, Sniper Elite 5 offers a solid gaming experience with a few minor quirks, making it an enjoyable addition to the series. Its historical accuracy, including the use of the Nazi flag, adds an extra layer of authenticity to the game. The immersive dialogue of the soldiers adds to the realism, making the game truly engaging. The personal details you discover about enemies while using binoculars adds an emotional dimension that deepens the gameplay experience.""",1698092098,1698092098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game boasts less content than its predecessor, Sniper Elite 4. Apparently, ""running while crouching"" was just too much of an extravagance for Sniper Elite 5. Who needs innovation and improved mechanics when you can have the authentic ""crouch-and-slow-walk"" experience that keeps you begging for more? The absence of running while crouching is a bold choice that says, ""We believe in tradition and refuse to be swayed by the allure of modern gaming.""

Also, who needs vast, open spaces when you can have endless twisty hallways, right?

In summary, Sniper Elite 5 takes all the conventions of open-world gaming and shatters them with the force of a thousand clunky controllers. It's a masterclass in not fixing what isn't broken and embracing the glorious world of narrow hallways. If you're tired of progress and innovation, look no further – Sniper Elite 5 is your ticket to the past.",1654404954,1697786837,False,0,0,0.340136080980300903,0,True,False,False

The game itself feels the same as Sniper Elite 4, the same stealth, sniper, shooter game.
It's fun, there's a lot of customization and a lot of ways to plan your strategy on how you want to kill your enemies.

One thing I find slightly irritating is that the Authentic difficulty is a little too easy. I've completed the game on Authentic, and it's quite easy to just use your binoculars to scope out the enemy and from there on decide how far away they are. Then it's just a fraction of taking out your rifle and shooting them. In Sniper Elite 4, it was so much harder than in this one.

On the other hand, some of the criticism in the other reviews are fair: it is a downgrade from SE4, and that's not what you would expect from a sequel. The un-reloadable, un-holsterable picked up weapons are arbitrary and annoying, and while the levels are still large, intricate and picturesque, *some* of them seem less open/more linear than they used to be, with less opportunities for actual sniping. I also feel like there's just overall less enemies in the game, or at least they are more sparsely placed around the maps - it's rare to find more than two germans within sight of each other, which makes clearing an entire level without firing a single shot almost trivial.

This is basically just the SE4 engine with extra maps and some dumbed down mechanics.

Other unfavorable changes from SE4: no more rocks to throw, no running while crouched, no authentic hardcore mode. The storyline is just okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round as we dive headfirst into the mesmerizing black hole of pointlessness that is Sniper Elite 5. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a game that defies every expectation, where boredom is the main attraction, then congratulations, you've stumbled upon gaming's magnum opus of nihilistic irony.

Sniper Elite 5's brilliance lies in its ability to take everything you've come to expect from a game and turn it on its head. The game opens with all the enthusiasm of a sloth in a sedative-induced coma, introducing you to Karl Fairburne, the protagonist who probably questions the meaning of life more than you do. His mission? Well, it doesn't really matter, because nothing in this game does.

The gameplay is a masterpiece of absurdity. It revolves around the concept of hiding behind cover, waiting for enemies who seem just as clueless about their existence as you are about yours, and then engaging in a slow-motion ballet of monotony as you line up your shots. Each kill is punctuated by an X-ray kill cam, which serves as a stark reminder of the sheer absurdity of it all. It's as if the game is saying, ""Look at this! Isn't it ridiculous?""

The AI, or lack thereof, is a work of art in itself. Enemies saunter around like they're on a leisurely stroll through a warzone, and they hardly react when their comrades mysteriously drop dead around them. It's almost as if they've given up on life, just like you while playing this game.

As for the story, it's a narrative rollercoaster that somehow manages to go in a straight line. Characters deliver their lines with all the enthusiasm of someone reading the phone book. You'll find yourself chuckling at the sheer absurdity of trying to care about a plot that seems more interested in mocking you than engaging you.

Graphically, Sniper Elite 5 pushes the boundaries of mediocrity. The environments are as exciting as watching paint dry, which, ironically, might actually be more engaging. Character models look like they were rendered by a bored intern, and the animations are so stiff that you'll wonder if everyone in this game is secretly made of cardboard.

Sound design is another exercise in ironic indifference. The soundtrack seems to be on a never-ending loop of monotony, while the voice acting delivers lines with all the emotion of a malfunctioning robot. It's as if the game is laughing at you for even bothering to listen.

In conclusion, Sniper Elite 5 is a nihilistic and ironic masterpiece of tedium. It revels in its own absurdity, inviting you to join in on the joke. If you're in the mood for a game that not only embraces boredom but turns it into an art form, then Sniper Elite 5 is your ticket to a hilariously pointless gaming experience. Just remember, in the grand scheme of things, nothing really matters, and neither does this game. Enjoy! Or don't. It doesn't matter, anyway.",1696554754,1696554754,False,4,2,0.450674742460250854,0,True,False,False

Rebellion Developments has crafted a masterpiece that combines precision gameplay with a riveting narrative, delivering an immersive experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

From the first bullet fired, Sniper Elite 5 demonstrates a level of realism that's both awe-inspiring and challenging. The attention to detail in the game mechanics is nothing short of exceptional. Every shot feels deliberate, and every decision matters. Whether you're choosing the perfect vantage point or managing your resources, the game rewards strategic thinking and patience.

The level design is a testament to the developer's dedication to creating a dynamic, living world. Each environment feels meticulously crafted, offering a range of strategic options for players. Whether you're perched atop a crumbling building, navigating a dense forest, or infiltrating an enemy stronghold, the game invites you to explore and adapt.

The addition of new tools and gadgets adds depth to the gameplay, providing players with creative ways to approach each mission. From suppressed weapons for stealthy takedowns to environmental traps that turn the tide in your favor, Sniper Elite 5 empowers players with an arsenal that complements the methodical nature of sniping.

The narrative is both engaging and emotionally resonant, weaving a story of espionage and intrigue against the backdrop of World War II. The characters are well-developed, and their interactions add a human touch to the high-stakes missions. The campaign's pacing keeps you invested, with each mission offering a fresh set of challenges and objectives.

The game's signature slow-motion kill cam returns, and it's as satisfying as ever. Watching a perfectly executed shot in glorious detail never gets old. It not only serves as a testament to your skill but also adds a cinematic flair to the overall experience.

Multiplayer modes, including cooperative play and competitive matches, enhance the replayability of Sniper Elite 5. The thrill of outsmarting opponents or coordinating with teammates adds another layer to an already compelling package.

In conclusion, Sniper Elite 5 stands tall as a triumph in the genre. It's a game that demands precision, rewards strategy, and captivates with its immersive world. Whether you're a fan of stealth, tactical shooters, or gripping narratives, Sniper Elite 5 hits the bullseye and then some. It's not just a game; it's a testament to the art of sniping. Lock and load, sharpshooters – this one's a must-play.

Very good sequel ! 
On some websites it is mentioned as a kind of Addon to SE4. This is not true. Good gameplay, nice graphics in all the missions, AI is better, but still not perfect.

The multiplayer modes are affected mostly because there are no dedicated servers. Meaning that, if the host of a team-match (8v8 multiplayer mode) leaves the lobby, during the game or right before the match-ending screen, all the progress is lost. More than that, is it's happening during the match, you will get a ""migration lobby"" screen which will stop your session. 

For a game like SE5, multiplayer should have dedicated servers, especially when it was advertised as focusing on the multiplayer as well.

The campaign is good, definitely entertaining, but I feel previous titles like SE3 (Africa) & SE4 (Italy) had done a better job with the story-telling. Co-op was a fun experience and I look forward to trying out the Invasion mode (If people even bother playing it). The game has Cross-Play which is great if you have friends that you want to play with on Co-op, but have decided to be lame and go for consoles. Although cross-play probably isn't so great for multiplayer (Aim assist and all that).

I haven't really found any bugs in the game, with the only noticeable recurring bug that I've found is when you take-down an enemy, some of these NPC's decide to clip through the floor / walls and disappear.
Another issue is the auto-saving. You will have to save regularly, (With F5 / Pause Menu) as the auto-saving isn't good at all.

The scenery is great and the graphical detail is decent, but there is some things that need fine tuning, like NPC's often being stuck with a ridiculous face whilst unconscious or dead.
Even though (In my opinion) there's a handful of disappointing things with this particular title, I'm definitely enjoying the story of the game and love the idea of non-lethal ammo & mines.

This is a game that should essentially be bought on at least a 30% discount because really, it's only a 7/10 at best.",1670697406,1695504537,True,15,0,0.635675549507141113,0,True,False,False

The stealth is great. The new weapon customization options definitely increases game time and complexity and allows you to customize your weapon to be either more lethal or stealthy depending on your preferred play style. However, all these features are good but they don't deserve a full score, what is really the cherry on top, in my opinion; is the Axis invasion gamemode. Playing stealthily or loudly can get dull, eventually you master it. However every 15 minutes or so an enemy sniper joins you singleplayer game with their own play style and skill level. forcing you to change your play style and outwit the other player.

There is ~20-30 hours of content if you play on standard. The map design is very good, probably the best so far, it looks good, runs well in mission and has the classic feel we all love with some good updates to AI, UI and a lot of other things. Its fun, but its no Hitman 3 that's for sure!! Whats here is great, but there could be so much more. it almost needs to learn from hitman 3 and have the in-game achievements with fairly token unlocks to incentivise replaying missions to rethink and redo your kills for amusements sake. Also if you don't realise the kill missions require very specific methods of murder youll spend the entire game with 2-3 guns unlocked (if the game bugs like mine and doesn't unlock guns that require missions competition) 

BUT, a lot of the previous content from earlier games is pay-walled behind expensive DLC which doesn't add much. The DLC feels super lazy and money grabby. You get a few guns that were mostly free in previous versions of the game, a new map (despite maps being fairly easy to make as a lot of assets are easily recycled and skins galore, which makes no sense as in a single player game no one else sees the skins and in pvp no ones going to stop to admire you skin from 400m away....

The invasion aspect is mostly annoying and feels imbalanced. Either hide and wait out invaders or expect to randomly get shot/bush wookied while you try do objectives as players generally know how to easily camp and have all the advantages. Its an interesting feature, but needs work. It would almost be better if it was a multiplayer mode where lots of people spawn say 5v5 or 10v10, and Theres some kind of AI battle with objectives to force both sides to be more involved and have to choose between camping in a bush or winning the match.

Minuses it's still a very tunnel game, one mission one huge experience, the second time even on a harder level and non-lethal strategy, gives far less fun, even from another starting point, but to be fair enough it also helps to give a little of a new experience.
Also want a mention that the game is a little bit buggy.
Sometimes knockdowns send corpses underground. I had such a case when I knocked down an enemy in a non-lethal method, and his body dropped down through the textures and drowned in seconds, lol.
Same with multi-level structures, like a bunker, if it has a few floors you may knock down an enemy, and his body will be dropped on a lower floor.
Also, a jump is a buggy, you may be left mid-air stuck in obstacles like barbed wire, which happened with me a few times.

The game just does not push on thoughtful passing quietly at least because of the size of the maps (otherwise you'll just spend 3 days on one map) and because of the crowds of nazis that'll come for you if they detect you, you just get tired of fighting them off. So it's easier to take out all of them at once while you go through the map.
And so there are all sorts of things to pump your guns and additional missions as you explore the map.
Optimization is lame only in terms of video memory - the game needs more than 16 gb in 4K on ultra. I catch lags sometimes in the same place - when you squat or stand up.
I'd say it's casual version of Flashpoint/Arma. You don't have to lay down for 1 hour just to pass couple of soldiers.
You gotta give some credit to Rebellion for not giving up and still going with their Asura engine and not jumping to crappy Unreal Engine.
===============
В общем, яснопонятно. В целом, неплохая игра. Стелс, как показалось, не особо проработан. Уровень splinter cell 2005 года. Игра просто не подталкивает на вдумчивое прохождение втихую как минимум из-за размеров карт (иначе ты просто дня 3 будешь одну карту проходить) и из-за того, что когда все же палишься и на тебя сбегается тьма немчуры, то просто надоедает от них отбиваться. Уж очень зрячие. Поэтому проще сходу всех убирать сразу.
А так есть всякие штуки для прокачки пушек, доп.миссии по мере изучения карты.
Оптимизация хромает только в плане видеопамяти - игре надо больше 16 гб в 4K на ультре. Ловлю лаги порой на ровном месте - когда приседаешь или встаешь.
Эдакий Flashpoint/Arma на минималках, где не надо по часу лежать в кустах и выжидать, чтобы пройти мимо пары солдат.
Нужно отдать должное Rebellion за то, что не сдались и все еще тащат свой движок Asura и не перескакивают на паршивый Unreal Engine.",1694638674,1694638674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ A good looking game that's well optimised. Consistently runs at high FPS and doesn't seem to jerk or stutter at all.
+ Accommodates different play styles. Sniper only, run-and-gun, stealth/non-lethal.
+ Huge maps with different routes and several objectives. If you're planning a non-lethal/stealth run, prepare to spend several hours per map.
+ Granular difficulty controls, can easily fine tune to your specific tastes.
+ Unique multiplayer modes. Axis Invasions are the highlight; another player can enter your PvE mission and try to hunt you down, or you can do the same to someone else. Short queue times if you're invading. There's also a dedicated sniper mode called ""No Cross""; essentially, two teams snipe at each other across the map.
- The story... exists. You're John Elite, you're running around France sabotaging Nazi plans. That's it.
- Cheeky to suggest there are nine maps when number nine is essentially a thirty second epilogue. In reality, there are eight (plus DLC) full fat campaign maps.
- AI a bit weird at times. Even with the increased aggressiveness setting, they sometimes don't seem too concerned about investigating dead bodies or trying to co-ordinate flanks. Other times, if spotted, you'll be shot at with laser accuracy across large distances by pistols and SMGs. Tanks like to camp and stare at you incessantly.
- Enemy footsteps don't seem to exist in this universe.
- Maps aren't completely open. There are some routes and paths that are deliberately blocked.
- Axis Invasions seem to happen at the worst possible time (at least for me), when a mistake has been made or there's already pressure from the AI. When I've invaded other games, it tends to be on earlier maps in the campaign, possibly with other players still figuring out the game.
- The several other multiplayer modes are dead. There were about seven or eight custom games at the time of writing, five of which were Rebellion servers with zero players. I didn't go in expecting a vibrant multiplayer community, but it's something to keep in mind.

I'm writing this as a Sniper Elite 4 vet, and you should read this if you have already played SE4. If you haven't, feel free to read it also.

The question is, ""Should I spend my time on Sniper Elite 5?"". The answer is Yes, if you're familiar with the Sniper Elite franchise.

Graphically wise, it's improved from the last game(which is Sniper Elite 4, by the way). The color is much more defined, although it didn't overshadow the last game. Texture wise, things such as rocks and foliages and buildings, are not much different from SE4, unless you're counting pixels. Water looks better, although not significantly. Ballistic looks more enjoyable. Kill cam is more intimate and more casual. Body movements have been improved: Karl now ascending/ descending stairs with careful steps rather than running/ stampeding through as seen in SE4. Sniper Rifle's Scopes has more natural sway to it. Soldiers can be spotted wearing watches, added more realism to it.
Conclusion, it's improved, the same way GOW Ragnarok compared to GOW. 

Gameplay is more or less the same. I would say that this game adopted several key mechanisms from The Last of Us. Infinite stones for distraction are now replaced with limited bottles. Infinite Satchel Charges from SE4 are now replaced with Satchel Charges picked up from battlefields(you can still carry an inhuman amount of them, however). SE5 now introduced work benches(again, The Last of Us), with significantly more weapon adjustments compared to SE3(rudimentary) or SE4(non-existent). 
You might have seen some reviews online saying that SE5 is not as big as SE4, which is debatable. I would say that the maps are more compact but still big. It still can stump an SE4 vet like me from time to time. 
Picking up weapons from battlefields is no longer something you can do freely as in SE4, but I like it as it's significantly realistic. You can't just pick up a Sniper Rifle from the field and fire it, it doesn't work like that. However, you're allowed to use it as Temporary, which is acceptable. There are many more varieties to pick up from the field as well: weapons with attachments that give you advantages. 
Weapon Wheel is the same.
God vision, or something called Enemy Position has also been replaced with zones of interest(a colored circle that signifies the whereabouts of an enemy). Why, hello there, Ghost Recon Wildlands, I have missed you. This makes it more important to tag enemies, as you're no longer given the Detective Vision back in SE4.
Iron Sight is now officially in the game. Love it.
You can now take out enemies with non-lethal melee technique as well. Guess that they're slowing down after all the gruesome close-combat takedowns back in SE4. 
There are also fewer enemies in SE5, compared to SE4. In SE4, thanks to God vision, you can take out an entire base of enemies, like 20 or 30 of them Nazis, but here in SE5, even 3 to 4 of them is already some struggle. I personally think it's more intimate.

Music is not a thing. The warrior of Rome motif in SE4 is no longer here. I don't miss it particularly, but this is also a different game anyway. I would say that the Alarm sounds remind me of Wolfenstein a lot. It's okay, i don't think people are too hung up on the music department for this game.

The game ran well on my dated machine! It heated up the machine even less than SE4, what a relief!. Kudos to you, Rebellion.

As of now, the complete edition is quite expensive, but i'm happy with my Deluxe Edition. Will be purchasing the full Edition in the future.

The game is good, i will greenlit it if you ask me. That's all I have to say for now.",1694529909,1694530893,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Cons (that people say):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Not open world (completely false, you have so much freedom in each map)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Axis Invasion ruins the game (bullshit, its so damn fun, and honestly not hard at all. Makes it so much more intense, but both sides have their advantages/disadvantages)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Can't climb certain barriers and blah blah.. (also bullshit.. they must've been trying to climb over barbed wire or something)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphics are beyond amazing. XRAY, killcam, facial features, map features, everything. It just looks so much better.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay is really really good. Sure, you can't run while crouching (which i guess is a deal breaker to all the d riders out there?) but... just stand up? I mean, it really doesn't even make a difference. Besides, your character isn't smelling his balls as he runs anymore.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful weapon system/modifications. Allows very nice customizations to each weapon that you want to use, plus you see exactly how each mod affects each stat. Well done, honestly.

Everything in Sniper Elite 4, but better.

I love this game, even though it's really uneven - it does some things better than its predecessor (weapon customization for instance is a tad better than challenges-upgrades from 4th installment), while some it does worse (optimalization is rather below average). 

Worst offender is a price - I bought it on a sale, but still, managed to buy only one season pass with the vanilla game and it still cost me around 25$, pretty steep I daresay. I don't care for storyline, cause it was always mediocre at best in the series. GFX-wise, it's just a SE4 with some tweaks here and there - and by ""tweaks"" I can also mean ""some textures don't load properly at times"", though it's nothing gamebraking. What IS gamebraking, are bugs - sometimes enemies dissapear after a takedown, sometimes you can't take a proper aim at something with your scope, at times game can CTD or get laggy for a few seconds out of the blue. Also, to nitpick a bit - skill tree is even worse than SE4. Could be gone completely and nobody would even notice. Animations are a tad better, but still on the bad side. AI is more stupid than my boss. 

So yeah, to keep it simple and sum it up - game should have at least a half year more development time, but can still give you lots of fun. If you like killing nazis, it's for you.

They know where you are at ALL times. When in search mode (pretend don't know), their pathfinding is dictated by your position.
If you are seen by one guy, all the others instantly react as if they all have telepathy.
This is the fifth in the franchise and this stuff is still 'a thing'.
Your character getting caught on small objects on the floor, which would not obstruct a human being's waking pace.

I'm enjoying it, but there's a lot of time where your enjoyment is completely thrown off, if not obstructed/overshadowed by the pain in the A** BS coded into it, which completely dismantles any semblance of immersive or enjoyable stealth.

It's great, until it's not.

I've only played on max difficulty/authentic. 

Perhaps lower difficulties permit gameplay features/aids which help to balance out the scale by mitigating the broken immersion, but if you're going to have an 'authentic' difficulty, you should probably strive as developers, to ensure your game is up to that standard.

You know, immersively authentic.

Game sucked most of 2022 away from me! Highly recommend turning off music, putting on good headphones, and playing on Authentic difficulty.

Things I love:
#1 By far over previous entries is Sound ranges and Suppressors. Some of these attachments are unrealistic for the time but greatly speed up play. No more hoping for a sound dampener or dealing with half the map knowing exactly where you are. This also applies to most Secondaries and Pistols.

#2 Aim Down Sights on all guns! Was very annoying in the older games that you couldn't do this!

#3 Souls-like Yager Invasions! You can invade or be invaded by another player. Fear not that it'll ruin your game... it auto saves when they first load in and you can choose to reset to before they loaded in if you die or from the last checkpoint (they do occur during invasions if it's safe enough). Also, take note that unless you are on authentic difficulty, you can see them through walls with focus and if they are far away the compass will point you to their direction. They don't get this advantage. Also, you have 0 ping so host has massive advantage. Also, both Karl and Jager should know that the Jager always spawns pretty close to Karl. I think the furthest I've ever seen was like 150 meters away.

#4 Despite what the individual reviews of the DLC says, most of the DLC maps are better for advanced play than the vanilla ones. Also... IMHO the Lee Enfield is the best stealth rifle in the game and that's only available as DLC... get complete or Season passes and it won't feel like a ripoff.

Could be better:
#1 If you are ANY model of Karl, his monologuing can give you away to an invader. Wish you could turn it off so you can enjoy the Karl Gillie.

#2 I wish you could see your single player Invader kill count.

#3 Wish you could rate your match and send some GG's to Invader or Karl. You can request rematches but that seems to be it.

#4 Wish there was some kind of time limited reward or something for Invasions. Once earned all the cosmetics for Karl or the Jager, no real incentive to keep doing it other than for fun.

Anyway, I have no major issues with game... definitely my pick from 2022. I have a youtube playlist of mostly short videos if you want to see some of this in action.

Both the campaign and multiplayer and have enjoyed the experience quite a lot. The Sniper Jager invasion feature is a stroke of genius and adds a ton of great gameplay moments. 

That said, I cannot give this game a good recommendation due to it's predatory DLC packs. They recently released the 'Complete edition' with all the DLC's and Season passes however you cannot purchase this if you already own the base game.

goofy third person very light stealth / sniper action game. it's fine. better than the last one, not as good as the zombie one, probably. I dunno. it's fine.

91 Gigabytes of space needed, however, is a howling scandal. for what's in here, that's SHOCKING. I don't know where all that space is going for a single game, but I have a sneaky suspicion it wasn't released this size. I have a gut feeling that the needed HD space went up along with the release of the DLCs. 91 gigs for ""Sniper Man 5"" is madness. that's insane. if you've got a 1tb drive ""Sniper Man 5"", the game where you shoot Nazis in the sack and get awards for it, takes up a tenth of all available space.

Multiplayer is a bit frustrating, sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit. Hacking can be frequent. And obvious. And the balance is non-existent. Peer 2 Peer Hosting is the worst idea ever, with the match just ending if a hosts leave mid-match. Happens so frequently... that you just get used to it. Luckily XP earned is instant, only xp loss would be a possible match win bonus.  

Single player campaign is quite lengthy. The maps are a mixed batch. Some are good, some are not.  
I would say more good than bad maps. But only a few that encourage Sniping. Then again, I don't see this as a sniping game, as much as a Stealth game.  
Difficulty customization are very detailed, and allow for great personal customization. Only miss is a Authentic Plus Mode, seen in Sniper Elite 4.   

Survival, it's not as hard as previous games, but still quite fun overal. Higher difficulties can become a challenge, as are playing anything but solo. 

Invasion mode is a nice welcome, albeit the huge nerf to the invader since release. It adds a little challenge. However once you're quite skilled at invasions. Matches can be completely crap, frustrating and boring. Or Amazing. Not really anything in between. 
Due to the fact, you'll get matched against players playing for their first time. And players who've spend the past 8 hours on a single map, gathering every single explosive they could find to make it a guaranteed deathtrap. And they'll just be camping in some cuboard, waiting for you to step on a mine.  But once a match is good, youll be guaranteed to rematch multiple times.  

Weapon customization. 
Ok, so the most unrealistic part if you ask me. But then again, Not an unwelcome part. 
Unlocking of new weapons, or weapon modifications are done through challenges ingame, encouraging replaying levels. And compared to the 4 challenges per weapon that would ""upgrade"" it in previous games. This allows for more persoinalized equipment. Very noticable when picking up someone else their rifle or SMG in multi-player modes. Often, you'll just not like the feel of a weapon.  
And allows for a more wide style of gameplay, from full assault to stealth purist.

Some issues I have with SE5 are:
- Awkward character movement and difficulty with terrain, often resulting in moonwalking against invisible obstacles, only being able to vault over low walls in certain places, things like that (Mission 8 is a nightmare in this sense). 
- Weapons and upgrades: right in the first 3 or 4 missions you can already get the best weapon set-up for the whole game and anything after that is basically useless. Most upgrades and weapon unlocks (some of which require Kill Challenges) really represent no improvement and often send you back down a notch or two, making them  more a frustration than a reward.
- Characters..... ok, woke and all that crap, but a black Scottish special ops woman in WW2? Stretch things much? The Scots had the Black Guard but there were no women there and anyway, they were fighting in Africa. If you're going to throw historical accuracy entirely out the window (I mean, more than you already are with all the ridiculous secret weapons and Möller character), you might as well make the game about aliens on a different planet.

The X-ray cams seem so generic too. It felt in SE4 there was more variety to what you saw in terms of organ damage. 
My biggest gripe though, is that the Developers gave us NOTHING new - improved NOTHING - and charged us full price. Too add insult to injury, get ready to pay big time for DLC missions and weapons - which there is very little variety in the game.

（1）升级系统不好：多数玩家任务过40级就无法升级了，通过纯粹多人游戏（生存模式不算，生存模式无助于升级）升级非常虐心，游戏延迟、噪音大，脑残多，几乎就是比显卡、比网速，且游戏模式一成不变，同质化严重，吸引力会逐渐下降；
（2）平衡性不够好：入侵模式下，入侵一方无法拾取武器，无法开启屏息辅助，而防守一方却都是可以的，相当于开挂，这样很不好；我敢说，这游戏一旦把入侵模式做好，做得更具有挑战性后，游戏将非常有意思。比如，我提供一个思路：现在不是打战役只能提升到40级吗？可以改变为：如准许入侵的前提下，在有人真的入侵和打胜了的情况下，通关后可以继续升级到41级及以上；同样地，入侵一方如果赢得了比自己级别更高的对手，积累到一定赢盘数也可以升级到41级及以上——那这样一定会大幅度吸引老玩家来反复重温已通关战役，这样在线人数多了，也会吸引新玩家参与入侵模式——  《狙击精英》系列的亮点不正应是结合大地图的【对抗性】+【策略性】互动吗？多人游戏那种不叫对抗性，那是一堆人投机取巧+轮盘赌，一露头就被干死，没有什么战术性和策略性可言，我敢说《狙击精英》非要指望走《CS》系列那种模式，是在错误的道路上越走越远，注定会被淘汰。
（3）武器系统不好：各类武器可供升级核心功能的选择不多，升级或改装后功能差别不大，开发团队热心于制作一堆枪械皮肤，其实真正的铁杆FPS玩家不太看中皮肤这类东西，何况你皮肤设计得也不好看，关键不同皮肤真的仅仅是皮肤，对在游戏中的功能提升或转型毫无贡献，纯粹就是走少女外形控路线，没有实际意义，升级经常生了个寂寞。早起玩家为了解锁部分枪械功能，还会努力打拼，一旦解锁完毕，就没有动力玩下去了。
（4）能力升级系统：与武器系统类似，早起玩家为了获得升级点以提升能力，还会努力打拼，一旦解锁完毕，就没有动力玩下去了。当所有玩家都是40级+，打多人游戏又非常痛苦，觉得毫无区分度，玩着玩着也就没什么吸引了；
（5）武器更新太慢：我能理解开发团队想通过每次升级一两款枪械的这类“添油战术”，来多次吸引玩家买武器包或季度包，这么干本无可厚非，但你们给出的武器系统问题在于，要是武器种类有限，那咱就把每种武器的配件和升级系统做得更丰富，更自由，更耐玩，以使武器系统更有生命力一些；要么就开发更丰富的武器，现在即使是完整版内的武器也太少了，连加兰德A1、1888式这类都没有，有点太不思进取了；
总之，《狙击精英》系列这款游戏的开发团队及其股东，应该扪心自问，想想清楚热爱狙击类的玩家群体到底想要什么游戏，你们能够给这么多新老玩家带来什么体验，是不能自已地一味跟风丧失狙击游戏的魅力，还是坚持底线努力为玩家们献上一款更为符合狙击战对抗性和策略性特色的游戏。
最后，我还是给出【推荐】，批评不是为了扼杀和劝人止步，而是为了市场真的能识别出什么好的狙击类游戏。

[b]As an ardent fan of the Sniper Elite series, I've been captivated by its immersive gameplay and meticulous attention to historical detail from the very beginning. With the release of Sniper Elite 5, my admiration for this franchise has reached new heights. Set against the backdrop of war-torn France in 1944, this latest installment continues to follow the journey of the iconic Karl Fairburne as he battles the enigmatic ""Project Kraken.""

From the moment I stepped into the virtual world of Sniper Elite 5, I was greeted by breathtaking vistas and meticulously crafted environments. The landscapes are a testament to the developer's commitment to recreating the atmosphere of wartime France. Each mission is a marvel in itself, with sprawling maps that invite exploration and a level of detail that leaves no corner unexplored.

One of the most striking features of Sniper Elite 5 is the painstakingly recreated architecture of the era. Every street, building, and structure feels authentic, transporting players back in time to the tumultuous 1940s. The commitment to historical accuracy enhances the immersion and makes every encounter within the game world feel incredibly genuine.

What truly sets Sniper Elite 5 apart is the sheer diversity and scale of each mission. Every mission is a work of art, intricately designed to be visually stunning, unique, and endlessly engaging. The addition of new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to hide in high grass, scale walls and pipes, and conceal fallen enemies, has completely transformed the strategic landscape. These innovations demand players to adapt and strategize like never before, leading to an entirely fresh experience.

The introduction of ""starting positions"" is a brilliant stroke that empowers players to unlock new vantage points as they progress through missions. This not only enriches replayability but also allows for a dynamic evolution of playstyle and strategy. These starting positions have become an invaluable tool for mastering missions, ultimately enhancing the overall enjoyment of the game.

The arsenal of weaponry and accessories at players' disposal is truly remarkable. The inclusion of different types of ammunition adds an extra layer of tactical depth, influencing decision-making and encouraging players to explore new strategies. The hallmark feature of the series, the X-ray kill cam, has been refined to perfection in Sniper Elite 5. The bone-crushing realism of every shot, whether from a rifle, pistol, or machine gun, is astonishing. The level of detail in the depiction of bodily organs during these sequences is both shocking and awe-inspiring.

Visually, Sniper Elite 5 is a marvel, with stunning locations and landscapes that push the boundaries of what modern gaming can achieve. The game's graphics are a testament to the developer's dedication to creating a visually immersive experience that does justice to the era it portrays.

Furthermore, the extensive range of post-launch DLC missions is a testament to the developer's commitment to keeping players engaged and entertained long after the game's initial release. This consistent support has added considerable value to the game and ensured that fans like me remain enthralled.

The multiplayer experience in Sniper Elite 5 is a well-crafted affair, with a robust anti-cheat system that has virtually eliminated the scourge of cheaters. This has rejuvenated the multiplayer community and breathed new life into the competitive aspect of the game.

In closing, it's clear that words alone can't encompass the entirety of Sniper Elite 5's brilliance. This game is a testament to Rebellion's dedication to excellence, and as a devoted fan, I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to traverse the battlefields of wartime France with Karl Fairburne once again. Sniper Elite 5 is not just a game; it's an experience that has left an indelible mark on my gaming journey. Kudos to Rebellion for crafting a masterpiece that has brought immeasurable joy to fans like me.[/b]",1692752470,1692752470,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I have only played this game in single player mode so far.

I got SE5 and the season one pass on sale, having completed all of the content of SE4 multiple times (but not managing to get all achievements - especially the time limited ones).  The game doesn't disappoint.  Lots of varied weaponry and lots of different approaches.  Heavy weaponry is much more satisfying than the limited options available in SE4.

It's not completely open word, there are some things I'd like to climb on that I can't.  There are parts of the environment that I'd like to interact with that I can't (like turning over a cart to provide cover).  The audio dialog repeats when you replay missions.

What I have found though is that there is enough in it to keep me coming back ... can I master this weapon, can I try completing the mission with different equipment, or melee killing all the snipers (not an achievement though).

The game lets you save as well as periodically saving when you're not in combat.  You can have a relaxing session picking of enemies at range, or running in front of them and letting rip with your SMG (or the MG42 you have 'liberated'), or sneaking in close and using a silenced (or not so silenced) sidearm.  Then you can save your mission and come back to it, or just abandon it and restart another time.  And you can choose your difficulty level so the game becomes rewarding and challenging in different ways.

I did enjoy the new customization options but I felt they were a little too ridged. If you're special forces in WWII, why can't you put an American 16X scope on a Kar98k? I understand mounting systems were different back then and not universal like the Picatinny rail systems on rifles today, but someone could've forged a custom bracket to mount your scope for you I'm sure. Do you need a 16X zoom scope on the majority of missions? Absolutely not, but the option to use one would've been nice.

Well, to be honest... the game is just mediocre at best. It has no epic ""feeling"" of war, as back in previous versions of Sniper Elite franchise. Technically the game looks as good as SE4, but only if textures load correctly. Yes, there are loading textures issues a year after release, even though, the game literally looks the same as SE4 from 2017. Music is also worse compared to Karl's adventures in Italy. Hell, the series were never known for good story lines, but this one blew my mind as one of the worst ones I have ever seen in any game. Karl Fairbourne after this iteration should get retired.

Rebellion has already proven that they can make a great games, but this one seems like it was rushed and released way too fast, and never really finished the game. The maps are great (at least in base game), especially map in mission number 3. However you can also feel that the entire great design of maps wasn't correctly used.

And the last part is pricing. Hell, I bought it at somewhere around 60% discount, yet imho it is still overpriced. I have deluxe edition, so missing season 2, but s1 is already bad enough that it doesn't encourage to buy another one, unless it will cost somewhere around 1-2$. But again, having two season passes in this game, that feels unpolished, with two crappy-dlc maps feels like rip off done by Rebellion.

While I had moments I loved in this game, and spent over 42 hours playing it, I suggest you to wait until price drops to 10$ for this to buy. And that is, including both season passes.

This is not a bad game... if you've never played SE4 (coming from a person who has 100% completed Sniper Elite 4). This game has a lot of minor irritations that make me question if the devs knew what the hell they were doing.

Here are a [i]few[/i] things (rambling incoming):
[list]
[*]-No crouch running
[*]-Finite bottles instead of infinite rocks
[*]-Want to switch a weapon in your loadout? If you're not at a workbench, then fuck you. Oh sure you can grab a weapon from a body, but after that one mag you discard it. So say you have a welrod, but you've screwed up and now you're in a firefight. Too bad kid, you're stuck with the welrod unless you find one of max 3 workbenches around the map (trust me, you won't be anywhere near them when you need one)
[*]-Speaking of weapons, I really don't like how suppressors work. Why would I want to use subsonic ammo with a weapon that has no suppressor? I don't. In SE5 you have to commit with what playstyle you want to go with. You can't do it like SE4 and use subsonic ammo when in a pinch and when you just need to take down 1 guy. Nope, now either you customize the weapon to have a low noise range, or you don't. Trying to balance it doesn't work and you just end up with an inferior weapon. And yes, while you CAN change this mid-mission at a workbench, have fun going to one of 3 fixed locations to change it.
[*]-The worst autosaves I've ever experienced in a game. EVER (game doesn't autosave so if you fuck up have fun redoing the last 10 minutes!). SE4 got this right, so why doesn't this game?!
[*]-Explain to me how an armored car can survive 2 teller mines and a block of TNT
[*]-My MP40 couldn't fire through some thin wood. Hey I guess they have to justify all the ammo types.
[*]-Static alarms are just worse in every way compared to the radio operators in SE4.
[*]-Why the absolute fuck doesn't your character default to the same stance you had before? If I crouch and pick up a body, then why does my character stand up after dropping the body. This can be the very reason you would get spotted if you drop a body say in a patch of tall grass and Karl thinks it's a good idea to stand up.
[*]-Let me disable the ugly white outline when I'm in foliage
[*]-Why do I have to interact with every item manually to pick it up? Just make me auto pick it up when I'm near it. Why wouldn't I want more items/ammo?
[*]-Why can enemies block a takedown? Karl is canonically an absolute unit that has destroyed entire operations single handedly. How can he not melee a random guy?
[*]-Terrible feedback and control. A lot of the times when I miss my pistol or sniper shot and want to switch to my SMG, it just doesn't. Same with aiming after reloading or looting a body. This game feels very clunky and shooting enemies with your smg/pistol doesn't feel good (unless getting a well placed headshot).
[*]-AI is arguably worse than in SE4
[*]-Some enemies never moving and standing in one of only a handful of ways to progress (you're forced to either kill him ranged or find a different route for stealth)
[*]-Don't bother with third person shooting. Since they now have first person shooting, trying to headshot a guy in third person is almost impossible. Weapons are peashooters and have terrible accuracy. Also the first and third person crosshairs don't line up sometimes.
[*]-You can't shoot in third person with snipers anymore, but seeing as that doesn't work anyways why bother I guess.
[*]-Bad maps. Maps in SE4 were big and were pretty complex. Here a lot of the maps are just basic flatlands with some buildings. The second mission is a joke with how small and empty it is (and don't get me started on the 'final' mission). There are a lot of 'zones', and rarely are the maps truly open. You usually get funneled to 2 or 3 chokepoints.
[*]-Poor weapon roster. I can already see the 3 season passes this game will get, with a 'weapon pack' consisting of only a single weapon (seems that atm they are just re-releasing the exact same DLC weapons as in SE4. These should have been in the base game).
[*]-Weapon attachments look awful
[*]-Karl won't shut the fuck up. I don't have to hear that 'I have to move' every time I'm in combat or that 'this foliage will keep me hidden' every goddamn mission. Or when picking up a weapon I don't have to hear Karl loudly comment on him picking up said weapon.
[*]-I often pick up enemy weapons on accident when trying to loot corpses. Ffs just make it either a hold or change the default bind so that they're different. Actually this is also the case with either using the key to open the door or placing a satchel charge. SE4 again got this right.
[*]-Rip tripwires and S-mines. Now you only have a non-lethal option.
[*]-No leveling past level 40
[*]-Enemies often instantly begin firing at you when they spot you. In SE4 if you were close they would first do a shocked animation, giving you enough time to quickly kill them before they would alert anyone else. Enemies will also sometimes keep firing while in the takedown animation.
[*]-Why is non-lethal an option? It's Sniper Elite. You kill nazis. You're not forced to do this so it isn't THAT big of a deal.
[*]-Bugs. This game has some minor but frequent bugs. It's still hard to properly go for a corner takedown and I once couldn't melee a dude who was leaning out of a window fsr, and then EVERYONE was alerted :)
[/list]

It really feels like the devs had to make you weaker in order to 'balance' the gameplay. In a lot of ways this game is a downgrade. It also kinda feels like the devs changed random things just because.

SE4 with all DLC is only around 9 bucks during sales, which is an infinitely better deal than buying this. If you (for some reason) do want to try SE5, then [b]DO NOT BUY [u]ANY[/u] DLC[/b].

Things I do like:
[list]
[*]-Enemies can't hear you through multiple floors anymore, so no worries about alerting an enemy that's a floor above/below you
[*]-Option to set satchel charge fuse time
[*]-Symbols aren't censored
[*]-You can sabotage vehicles for soundmasking
[*]-Reload mechanic is alright
[*]-Seeing character bios even when dead. I always enjoy reading random info about soldiers I encounter (before I brutally murder them without mercy)
[/list]

The actual campaign is disappointing though, and unlocks don't carry over between campaign and multiplayer so there is no real advantage to playing it for that reason. Levels are often too big for their own good and full of invisible walls and closed off buildings, level 3 especially is a maze.

The main benefit to SE5 over SE4 is the weapon customisation, which is absolutely brilliant despite being sectioned off between PvP and PvE. The detail of options is excellent, and it makes it fairly easy to take any weapon and make it fit most roles - at last the Welrod is not the only stealth pistol option.

Pros:
1. Full multiplayer campaign, and several fun other multiplayer modes. Woo, friends!
2. Unique music for each level with varying levels of intensity based on combat
3. Sniping feels good, kill shots return in their typical glory
4. Unlocked perks in single player are useful and welcome
5. Weapon customization is fun - lots of detailed specs to drool over and really create your own play style
6. Plenty to do in each massive map. 
7. Plenty of unlockables, hidden locations and items, lore - great stuff
8. Beautiful environments/graphics
9. Very good replay value - higher difficulties that introduce fun mechanics (no indicator of your location on map, reloading a magazine throws out the bullets you left in the dropped mag, etc), different starting locations to unlock on each level
10. Steam deck plays awesome - i lock at 40 fps with medium settings and looks fantastic

------------------------
CON - THIS NEEDS FIXED YESTERDAY AND UNBELIEVABLE IT STILL ISN'T, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ALL OVER FORUMS:

HUGE ISSUE - if you are going to play on a controller, prepare to rip your hair out. The joystick deadzones ARE MASSIVE - and you cannot alter them in any way. I'm talking, i can move both joysticks in full 360s without my aimer or character even moving. It is MISERABLE. Fine tuned aiming is not possible at all. You move the joystick - get nothing, move it slightly more - still nothing - move it EVEN more, then suddenly you've way overpassed your target. I cannot emphasize how frustrating this is.

If you're on Steam Deck, you can at least use the track pad as a mouse, adjust the sensitivity to suit your aiming, and when you zoom in just use that for precise aiming. It works, but doesn't feel particularly great. But on any standard controller - you're going to get very frustrated, very quickly.
-----------------------

Other Cons:
1. No more crouched jogging - you move very slow crouched and can only jog standing up......what though??? Why?? Please bring this back
2. Unable to swap weapons for keeps in missions - you can pick up enemy weapons, steal its ammo, or use the one mag, but then you drop it
3. Steam Deck doesn't have anti-cheat so no multiplayer modes or Axis Invasion is playable...bummer
4. AI can be derpy - for example they're looking for you then take cover at a bail of hay next to a wall and poke their head to aim while just staring at the wall directly in front of them

For Single Player Only

So now we are in number 5 of what I like to think as a great sniper series. I have enjoyed all previous versions, and this one is pretty good. There are a few issues that makes me wonder what the devs were smoking that day, but in general, it's a fun playthrough.

I have the deluxe version with season 1 pass, bought this game on discount. I buy all my games on discount LOL

Well the few bad things are the fact that other people have mentioned, the invisible walls. If you want to run over a small dune that is knee high, sometimes you will get blocked. This can be annoying and it is. Also, collectables can be scattered everywhere on large maps where EVERY room is available to explore. Spy Academy is really annoying for this one. 

Other than small issues, the game is great. A nice feature is that you can use bullets from other guns if you are running low on ammo. 

So I would be looking forward to Number 6 if that is even in the works. Would be cool if they did it where Karl had to return to the US and infiltrate Nazi's on US soil. Even if its for a map or 2.

Would love to see a reboot of Number 1. But anywho, if it's on sale, get it. If you are already a fan, you won't really be disappointed.",1691789709,1691789761,True,1,0,0.518846988677978516,0,True,False,False

This game has no surprises and if anything might be a little worse than 4. There is basically very little change, you still play as Karl who's bland as fuck, you still sneak around nazis whilst mortal kombat xray-ing them in the nuts with your sniper and you still continue the trend of picking a country and making that the theme of the game. 

And it's perfectly fine. Just that though, fine. It's the sorta game my dad would enjoy, it gives just enough challenge and diversity to be engaging but doesn't overwhelm you with options, plus it has harder difficulties for those who find medium a little too easy. 

The issue I have is that you can cleary see this game has some jank. It's got decent environments but character models are weak, music is decent but voice acting is not and the character animations are better than ever but still a bit janky. 

The issue I have is this game feels like it really limits your ability to be a sniper and feels more like it's trying to be hitman with it's open environments and options for killing targets, it is a weird mix up of hitman and metal gear solid 5 whilst struggling to be as good as either and also trying to remember the game is about sniper kills. 

Look it's very decent fun on sale and I can certainly see the appeal but this is the game that has given me sniper elite fatigue, think I'll just stick with zombie army for now.

Sniper Elite? More like Silenced Pistol Elite. Like bruh. Anytime you fire a rifle, or even anything other than the silenced 1911 enemies will swarm you, and not just a few, legitimately about 50 all at once. 

Another thing to note - Why are SMG's completely useless outside of 2.3 centimeters away? the recoil / accuracy is completely out of control. You cannot hit a thing unless you shoot one tap at a time. Also why can you hit an enemy straight through the heart 3 times and they just flinch and move on like it was nothing? This has been a problem in the last 2 sniper elite games as well but it definietyl still happens here too. 

Next gripe - the maps are so big that it's completely overwhelming in my opinion. I enjoy branching paths, and different options for stealth, but the maps are so large it almost feels like a chore. Think of a hit man level but 3x as big. Of course this is my opinion, but I preferred the map design on sniper elite 4 much better.

Another thing - Enemies will legit spawn near you after you clear an area, and the WILL kill you. 

So basically - not enough ""sniping"" sidearms are almost completely useless outside of headshots or pointblank, gigantic overwhelming maps. and in a lot of ways this is a re hash of the same game we've played since sniper elite 3 and 4. 

 Even with my complaints, I do think this is a great game. and I had a fun time with it. I finished in about 9 hours. While it was frustrating at times, the exploration is vast and you might need to play a few times through to see everything in a certain level -
This is more of a splinter cell meets ww2 type of game, and less of a sniper game. If that's what you are looking for though, I think you will love this. Oh, also the graphics are quite good.  

Might replay in a year or two.

This is the sequel I've always expected in modern times and now I finally got it with a FOV slider. The FOV in SE2/3/4 made these games almost unplayable for me, there was no mod and Rebellion refused to address this issue for so long. But now we finally have it, an SE that really gives you all the freedom you've ever wanted and it's just a great game. 

I especially love these extremely large and detailed maps, made with so much attention to detail and hidden things. Depending on your playstyle, you can waste hours on a single mission. I personally prefer to play stealth with a bit of action here and there. Well, let's face it, the action happens when I do a stupid thing and all hell breaks loose, and that's where this game shines in my opinion. If that happens, it doesn't mess up the whole mission. It's always like having a small battlefield, on the larger battlefield. It's not realistic, but it's still fun. Nobody wants to lose their mission because of a mistake or reload afterwards. At least I personally like to live with my mistakes in this game and the game is perfectly designed for that. 

I have to mention it again, the maps are insanely cool, there is so much to discover, even beyond the side objectives. I can't imagine how much work it was to finish all these maps and make them work with everything on them. I haven't beaten the game yet, but now, after about 15 hours, I'm already giving it a 4/5 considering I had it on sale for only $17

-have more levels ( at least double the current amount to stay relevant )

-the dlc's was absolute garbage. Literally the kind of shit a team of noobs would make in unreal engine if you gave all asseets

I have played every Sniper Elite game since the start, but never really took to them. I think this was due to Sniper Elite's poor graphics compared to other games on the market at the time of their release(s) as well as very generic/bland story lines.

However, Sniper Elite 5 has approved upon all of the above, MASSIVELY. Playing on my 2560x1440 display, with all ultra settings, along with NVIDIA filters to make the game really pop, SE5 really does look fantastic.

The animations of movement, shooting and everything in between has gotten so much better. The audio has improved massively, I love the sounds the guns make when reloading/bolting. The graphical fidelity, the audio, everything is just so much more crisp and clear compared to SE4. The story line involving operation Kraken is deep, believable and had me hooked to the very end.

The only not so positive things I have to say about this game is that there are only 9 missions which, given how good you are at the game, can be completed really quite quickly, as I completed the entire game in just half a day (with plenty of breaks included in that time).

Also, the online connection on co-op campaign leaves much to be desired. I play on PC and my girlfriend plays on PS5. Whenever we played co-op, we could see each others' players lagging across our screens, when we were not lagging ourselves. Also, there were any cases where one of us would pick up and move a body to hide it, but on the other persons' screen the body is still there, causing confusion when a guard finds a body that you thought you hid. It is worth noting that we both have fibre internet with very strong connections.

Overall, I would rate this game an 8.5/10. I deducted 1 point for the lack of missions, as well as 0.5 points for the online connection (it seems an easy fix, taking away 1 whole point seemed a bit harsh).

I would Recommend this  game to others as like all the other sniper games i own i have had years of enjoyment sense Sniper Elite 1.

I know i am a late comer to Sniper Elite 5 but my opinion is solid.

Likes and this likes.

I would love to have been able to use all my previous sniper Sniper Elite 4 keyboard settings for this game and would have preferred the rocks to glass bottle to throw.

There's some game niggles like cannot run over some small objects and cannot lay down near walls objects
when close to them, i have to move away a little.

On the Kraken Awakes level, i have located all 3 Eagles but only 2 are showing up in my service record,
i may have to do the level from scratch. (curse}.

It's cool. Bots suddenly know where you are after killing someone from a mine or soundmasked shots. Because of the super perceptive soldiers, it becomes a gunfight real quick (especially mission 8).

Why did I do this?

There are several reasons why I came in your ass. These include, but are not limited to:

Your comment turned me on

You are cute

Your dad was too busy

How did I do this?

I rammed your rectum with my handsome hog until I turned you into a frosting factory.

Why am I telling you about this?

Your ass will be leaking ♥♥♥ for at least 36 hours and may be a slipping hazard. Also you might be gay.

How can you avoid this in the future?

#1 - This isn't about sniping much of the time. Thus far, most kills are probably under 100m, and a large number are even under 50m. Scoped rifles almost seem like a liability in some missions... the first mission, rounding corners constantly and going through narrow bunkers, I used a Thompson and a MG-42 most of the mission. Soooo.... more like SMG-Elite 5, especially compared to the previous game, SE 4, where a number of missions did have larger open areas to snipe from.

#2 - I read reviews about invisible walls, but that's not really it. The problem is the clipping is wildly chaotic. Sometimes, I can walk right up to a hedge... other times, I'm colliding with it despite the graphics showing another 6-8 feet of space before I should be touching it at all. This makes sniping over hedges and low walls a pain. Not so much an issue of navigation (mini-map tells you basically what can be moved across), but more an issue of sloppy clipping design around some areas of terrain.

#3 - Invasions aren't my thing. Played with them off the whole time so far, so one of the major changes of the game I am not even really experiencing. I don't want to play MP, so, that's a change that is lost on me I guess.

#4 - Movement feels worse than SE 4. I'm either running too fast, walking to slow, or crouch-walking about right. Karl will just freak out at full speed trying to find the angle to open a door sometimes, so hitting the Z key to walk or Ctrl to crouch is how I slow down when I need to, but it's too slow for advancing forward all that far. Speed of movement is a little off.


Overall, though, it's a fun game if you approach it as a combo of Wolfenstein and Hitman. It feels a lot like another universe where Wolfenstein is less dark and Hitman is less stealthy. I really enjoy blasting away with the SMGs and throwing grenades and using traps... but I'm not sure that's what players were expecting, especially since SE 4 had much more open maps. SE 5 still has those sniping mechanics, but after a fun little practice with the 1,000 meter target in the training area, I've since been making most shots, often with SMGs, at a distance under 100m, which is a bit odd. But that's how the map design pushes the player to play. Even the DLC maps sometimes feel not that open, with buildings and corners to clear more often than large open horizons.

Again, really fun, but not that much sniping despite the name.",1690830401,1690830401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

265 hours in. I am a casual older gamer. Hell, I played World of Warships for hundreds of hours. It got too toxic. I get off work around midnight, I might do a few beers after work, I may come right home. Either way, I get immersed in the game. Before I know it, it's 4:00 am. The graphics are nice, the sound as well. It's enjoyable. I've purchased all the missions as far as I know. I just finished the Kraken awakes. By far that has been my favorite. 

A critical review? I'll say not being able to climb over a lot things is ridiculous. There are things you can do in some places but not others. I know there are limits the programmers have to include but it would be nice if you could climb over a lot of things. A box in front of front of a stairway after I just climbed up a vine trellis or scaled some crates? I should be able to get over the box. 

The enemy AI, yeah, not consistent. I know they wanted unique experiences and give you weapons options, but I do not agree with all the damage the weapons provide. Regardless, the game is pretty, the world is large, the tidbits about enemy soldiers you watch with binoculars is a treat.

- Gameplay is pretty good, nice sceneries, good story.
- Decent story, Battle in France sounds good.
- Sniper Elite, let's kill some Axis.
- They fixed the weaponscopes they had in SE4, the pick-ups now don't have scopes all of the times.

Con's:
- At every game startup it goes to a website.. why?
- Every 1 to 2 hours, crash to desktop... why? Everyone has this, so fix this Rebellion, it makes the game unplayable.
- DLC's are expensive, but can't play the game without it. I Always thought that DLC's are bringing something extra to game, I thought wrong. Money, money, money.

There are precious few sniping spots in the missions, and very few objectives that demand usage of your sniper skills. The levels are quite constrained compared to the previous game, and there's a LOT of space that isn't traversable or usable.
Player movement is worse than previous games - the environment is much more visually 'noisy' now, and mantle/jump is less consistent. There are often knee-high obstacles you can't step over, but can't mantle either. There are also lots and lots of places where you can't jump/hang, but it seems like you should be able to. The cover system is improved, but still prone to nasty bouts of stickiness at the worst possible times.
I can't speak to the invasion system - maybe it's the secret sauce that makes this a 9/10 - but I can't see how it improves the base gameplay. There's already very little sniping, having another player trying to hunt you down is only going to make it more tedious to peel the onion on these levels.
The upgrade system, previously only tied to objectives, is now ALSO tied to finding hidden objects in levels, which makes it even more likely that you'll go through most of the game without seeing a lot of the content than previous games.
The 'special target' system is good - giving specific kill requirements adds the thimbleful of extra thought to their deaths that makes it more than just another speedbump in the missions.
The 'targets of opportunity' that show up as optional objectives are nice, but I found only one mission where it wasn't guaranteed that you'd be given those objectives through normal play.
Adding multiple spawn points to each mission is a wierd extra system to spend time on - there's basically no variation in how the missions play out, I'm not sure why Rebellion thought anyone would want to play them more than once. If you've gotten all the objectives, you've seen everything the mission has to offer.

In conclusion - This feels like Rebellion wanted to make a Hitman game with asymmetric multiplayer. It's not that, it's about 30-40% of that, and in the process they lost most of what made Sniper Elite 4 a good game. I'd have gladly paid 60$ for ""Sniper Elite 4: 10 more missions edition,"" but this isn't even close.

It's... fine for 10$, but it clearly cost way too much to make to sell it for 10$.",1690749722,1690749722,False,8,0,0.536694347858428955,0,True,False,False

However I just couldn't catch the sniper fever in the 5th game. I played the first four maps and the setting, the targets, everything became worse after the very first mission. The first mission let's you play in Normandy, it's a coastal area, small hills, a tiny village, a big radar station, some orchards. I explored every tiny corner of that map, I adored it. 

Then came the second mission. You start in a foresty area and have multiple ways to reach the castle/manor. So far, so good. The target and every other mission objective is inside the manor. Not in the perimeter of it, inside a multi-floor manor. You have two options, either sneak for an hour or accidentally triggering the alarm, going in full rambo with your sub machine gun. To finish the mission you have to get into a specific room, very unsnipery attitude if you ask me.

I thought to myself alright, maybe this one mission is the exception, let's try the next one. Your target? Get into a highly secured cathedral. Walled of. With tight street corners, a lot of corners, barely any free sight. Tiny bridges. Oh and you have to go all in, inside the temple on the very top floor. Snipers on choke points. But, what, why? You have a lot of silenced weapons, even some non-lethal ones, but what's the point if you have to kill specific guards, get discovered and the whole map escalates to a warzone.

This iteration is quite versatile. Snipe from afar, run and gun up close, stealth around and go stab mode for a bit. The levels are quite nicely done in general, large with some great sniping lines, multiple objectives, and plenty of nooks and crannies to explore for secrets.

The AI is pretty dumb. Classic shooting gallery stuff, running back and forth aimlessly and popping their heads out of cover to give you a target. But I suppose that's what makes it fun in the end. There are some customisable difficulty settings allowing you to choose how much the game assists you and some other handicaps for those who enjoy the punishment. 

It's good for a couple of runs with a buddy but doesn't hold much replayability as a single-player game unless you want to chase achievement medals for the sake of it. The PvP invasion mechanic is an interesting concept though and can provide an extra layer of excitement. The other multiplayer modes seemed to be dead / laggy servers so I didn't bother much. 

Story line is serviceable but forgettable. Graphics are good, no complaints.

Overall, worth it on a 50% special. The season passes look like a big ripoff though; £55 base price for 5 new maps (1 is very small) and a bunch of worthless weapons and skins.

I've played 3 and 4 and loved them both, and almost didn't buy this because of the bad reviews. I'm glad I pulled the trigger.

Con Everybody complains about: Invasion. 
You don't have to play with Invasion Turned on. Yeah, there's an XP loss, but I doubt you'd notice it. It's really not a big deal. Like, at all.

Other Cons: 
The invisible borders can be annoying, especially for a stealth game, let me hide in the bushes! Controls can be a bit wonky at time. Sometimes it's difficult to grab items, but just use the 'arrow' on the screen, hover it over the item you want, and it will let you select it most of the time. Can't think of much else I didn't like about the game.

Pros: 
You can adjust the difficulty a lot more than you can in the other ones. For example I like turning off the mini map, making the enemy search long and hard for me, and making them a good shot. But, I also left detection on, and kept loot turned on high so I could find a lot of mines because I love booby traps.

All-in-all it's a great game and it had a lot of the same magic the older ones. I loved the attention to detail with all of scenery.

In terms of gameplay and scummy overpriced DLC practices aside, this is a direct upgrade to SE 4. Stealth is better. Ballistics are better. Weapon Customization is now intricate part-by-part and represented visually in the gun's model, scopes are even interchangeable. Levels are a bit hit and miss, the first level especially feels very flat and open which does help with easy long-range shots to get comfortable with one's weapon but makes good stealth play much harder, I personally think ideal SE levels are a more fine mix between the two. cheaper stealth tactics seem a little less powerful too, it may just be my lack of practice since putting down SE 4 but I've found that Welrod sniping isn't nearly as powerful as it once was. (My other SE 4 golden gun, but still useful enough to be part of my arsenal here in 5)	


I do have to say with some sadness that it seems scope sights are now tied to each scope as a customization item, and cannot be swapped out for your favorite design. This is probably more realistic, but as someone who became very used to a modern rangefinder for assist-less bullet trajectory estimation, it does hurt a little. I can't personally mention the multiplayer as I'm most interested in the series' single-player content, but what I have seen in menus looks massively expanded upon from previous games. There's also the inclusion of a new optional ""invaders"" mode in which other players can join your single-player missions as enemy snipers and hunt you down, which is an awesome concept even if I'm yet to try it. With all this understood the game is a pretty direct follow-up in gameplay and design to the fourth entry, and is more of a good thing.


[h1]IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS GAME WITHOUT EXPERIENCE WITH THE SERIES:[/h1]


[i]Sniper Elite[/i] is best described as an open-level stealth series, but that's simplifying it a bit. You're dropped into an extremely large open level as a WW2 allied powers commando, with a set of gear you've decided on before the mission consisting of a rifle, a secondary weapon (Usually an SMG or shotgun), and a sidearm. This, plus some usable items, will be your backbone as you work your way through a set of pre-defined objectives all across each level's map. The backbone of your arsenal is your rifle, SE puts massive emphasis on an accurate sniping experience with simulated bullet drop, range adjusting, wind offset, bullet penetration, ricochet, etc. Your difficulty selection will decide how many of these interfering factors are enabled, and how many assist tools are provided to deal with them. All difficulties below the extreme range allow the ""steady your aim"" function to also gradually reveal exactly where your bullet will land, letting players still getting used to the mechanics score consistent shots at the cost of needing to invest more time to land a sure hit. 


This emphasis on your rifle also ties into stealth. The level's ambient noise as well as nearby loud props can help mask the sound of your fire, and since enemies will be hunting you over long distances their AI is designed to try and narrow down your location and flank around it, boxing you in and basing their strategy off of where they last were alerted to your presence. This unique formula of stealth over often incredibly large distances also means that going loud is perfectly viable since even unsuppressed shots can only be heard so far and the WW2 setting means separate groups of pursuing soldiers can struggle to communicate with each other. It's helpful to think of Sniper Elite as a sort of Commando Simulator, rather than pure stealth as optimal gameplay as in Metal Gear or Splinter Cell. To further this levels are scattered with items and weapons for you to stock up or swap your loadout with, and secondary objectives such as documents or optional side-quests to fulfill for higher completion. 


Because of the open-ended level design and nature of stealth games campaign missions are generally meant to be replayed to perfection, and progress is tracked with an XP system that rewards passive upgrades to your character and gear. Sniping itself is a skill you'll become more comfortable with too as you play, with time I found I was learning to predict shots well enough even without the assist features, and this massively opens up how you can interact with levels. I'd easily call SE beginner-friendly with its ""no wrong answers"" design philosophy but would warn against the series for anyone who isn't as interested in slower methodical gameplay.

Graphics, gameplay and story aside the Invasion gamemode is hands down one of the best mechanics in the game that separates this from any other Sniper Elite game! The cat and mouse game of ""Wheres the sniper?"" works great and is equally balanced on both sides pretty well. My only concern about the invasions are that if you're invading someones world and they have a teammate; After you pick off the teammate the other sniper has a 2 minute timer until you automatically win. I haven't experienced this yet but I can see how this can promote ""Hit and run"" behavior seeing how the other sniper doesn't know where you are unless they ring a phone, focus to see your estimated whereabouts or just see you in general. 

Overall just like any sniper I stay to finish the job instead of running like a coward and so should you...
(Plus its another kill towards your upgrades as an invader)

If you've never played a Sniper Elite game I would say this is a pretty good introduction to the game and it has some fun mechanics as well as a cool Survival mode (Up to 4 players) that can be fun and equally challenging as well as a multiplayer mode that im borderline terrified of touching

however, that is ultimately why I can't recommend this game because of performance problems while playing the campaign(I don't play multiplayer).  I got this game soon after it launched and didn't have any of the perf problems that many others reported.  I played about an hour or so each week as I had time and eventually made it to halfway through mission 7 which was back in Nov 2022 and stopped then when I got caught up in playing some other games. Fast forward to May 2023 I started back where I left off and started  having weird perf issues, the game will launch just fine and run well until about 30 minutes of playing and suddenly start having severe hitching and stuttering performance, lots of lagginess.
I was using a 1080ti and a 3900x and at end of May I switched to a 4070 wiht fresh install of windows 11, fresh install of latest drivers and still same perf weirdness.  No other game or app I have has ever done this, only this game. 
Your mileage may vary with how this game will run for you, but be very aware that it's not just me, many others have reported the same thing.   I doubt I'll ever do any of side missions or any dlc,  just can't see playing this game for 20 ~ 30 min only to have to save and use task manager to kill the game and Steam because the game is such a hot stuttering/hitching mess that it locks up Steam and it won't allow the game to be relaunched, stuck at ""stopping"" but never gets past that, I even let it sit there for 30 min just to see how long it would do that.
Anyway, enough ranting, the TL;DR of it is this - the game has issues and most likely will perform badly for you, even if you have newer and/or higher end hardware so I advise you to not buy this game.

EDIT 7/26/2023:  After taking a break from trying to play this game and then doing some digging, it turns out this game has at least 2 issues going on at the same time:
1.  has trouble running in DX12, you most likely will start getting ""device lost"" errors and the game will start freezing up at random times, even causing game to lock up to point where you'll have to use task manager to stop game, so run the game in VULKAN api
2.  all ULTRA settings are borked, they cause VRAM leakage which eventually cause game to freeze/laggy/hitching due to running out of VRAM.  does't matter if you have highest end card with 24GB of vram, seen some reviews of those with 3090TI having this problem.  I have a 4070 running game at 1440p, looks awesome at ultra, but then the above happens after a little while. turn down settings to high and problem is immediately gone!

I honestly don't see much, if any difference in ULTRA to HIGH, it sucks this game has issues and I still don't recommend getting it.  but if you do go ahead and buy it anyway, keep in mind the above and  it should help",1689401561,1690420588,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I picked this up on the summer sale and have just gotten through the story. The actual story-line is most likely the weakest part of the game, and the final mission is rather disappointing imo, but the level design, freedom and overall polish that is represented by the gameplay is peak stealth shooter. The levels are huge, and if you want to perfect stealth them, expect to be in them for at least 2 or 3 hours.

- IMO SE5 should be better then SE4 since it builds upon it. Sadly SE4 is the superior game. In SE5 there are no radio officers, the mortar strikes are virtually gone from the single player and the flare gun became a rare exotic weapon you can only use once. 
-The amount of weird AI glitches pile up when you start going loud. It's like the enemies got infected by Agent Smith and duplicate itself, to then glitch into each other and itself. 
- The weapons customization looks fun initially, but I'm not a big fan of it. I fear this took a lot of development time, Time that could have been spend into other more important things. What I do love it the fact you could choose your scope. That's the only customization I truly love, appreciate & want to see in SE6. 
- The wind mechanics in SE4 were better then in SE5. 
- The personal skills you unlock for Karl in the single player, there are some skills in there that you didn't have before in earlier games. These skills make the game way easier & I don't really understand why you receive these skills.  
- You can revive now, while it's new, I wonder if it fits into this game. You are a sniper, not RAMBO. Yeah sure you can play RAMBO style on easy, but where's the fun in that? Especially in a game called SNIPER elite? 
- Mission 9 ain't a mission, what a personal let down. I expected more. The guy should have been present somewhere in mission 8 at the end, after the final bunker. Every mission took me like 3 hours to complete, but this 'mission' 9 took me 3 seconds -_-' 
- Mission 8, oh boi I suffered, that one was a though cookie to crack. This 1 might be the only one that strongly recommends you to be stealthy and remain stealthy. 
- All other missions were top knotch, exactly what you would expect. Multiple entry points, multiple ways to get somewhere, secret passages, alarm posts you could deactivate, explosion barrels here and there. 
- The implementation of finding satchels, crowbar and bolt cutters is a good move. It really drives you to look around for stuff like intel & ammo, not just enemies. 
- The cutscenes you get are not wanted, not necessary, the developers shouldn't have wasted their precious & expensive development time on creating strong women just because it's a F hot woke topic these days. Stick to your core gameplay and just offer us a good mission intel before and after the mission. Strong women are so saturated these days that I personally nearly gag each time it gets shoved into my visual cortex. That US ranger that was present in earlier games, could have been the only buddy with boots on the ground you need. Since you have been in this war together for a rather 'long' time, but no he was just another a$$hol€ He had zero added value, you could have cutted him out aswell at this point. No camaderie, no brother in arms, no band of brothers, nothing, just another prick whining about rules. & Karl... apparently prefers to listen to a random wahmen, instead of actually listening & talking to this US ranger that has been assisting Karl the whole campaign in previous installments with solid mission intel. 
- Jager Snipers are annoying once they spot you & I love it. Sad thing is their position gets revealed like crazy. No more sublte glint in the scope, no no it's a mini rotating white dwarf star ready to go supernova. 
- The weapon customization needs parts which you need to unlokc at workbenches during missions. Despite all that, you only get 6 weapons in total. 6 Snipers, 6 SMG's & 6 pistols. 6 Snipers in a sniper game... *sighs* No Carcano, no Lee-Enfield, I found this a bit lacking. Sure you can expand your armory by buying rather expensive DLC, it just stings/stinks.

The gameplay itself is great, it has interesting stealth mechanics and even allows you to use stealth in combat if you fail the stealth part. However, the game is also incredibly unstable.

Bugs from day 1 still in the game, still beta testing the game for the devs and the additional dlc is a joke. But hey got a few extra weapons thanks season pass for things that should have been in the game but they needed a reason for a cash grab. So glad i pre-ordered this sh!t-heap
         Recently figured out some horsesh!t about this games drm. not only does it have kernal level control over your computer but it slows the game down a couple frames. I have been wondering for months why I am getting shot through everything, its frame lag from the drm. so you get punished for paying for the game rather then pirating a copy. gg rebellion way to f@ck the paying customers.
         From someone who put over 2000 hours into SE4 I simply cannot see myself putting anything near that in this abject failure of a game. I tried to rack my brain for something that is actually an improvement and I could only come up with 2. The more realistic ballistics and the upgrade system, aside from that the rest of the game is worthless. Where should i start with the cons(just what infuriates me)
   1) Untold number of glitches, from day 1 we have been given an unpolished game. We basically beta tested the game and told them all of the bugs we ran into and not even half of them have been fixed. 
   2) Playing the game on authentic is nowhere as challenging as SE4, yes the AI cheat but the fact you can still stealth missions on that level of difficulty is laughable
   3) Non-lethal. why oh why is this even a thing. why do you get extra XP for sparing people. I can understand if you needed someone to be knocked out for extraction, but there is none of that in this game. I cannot for the life of me remember needing to knock someone out and extract with them, correct me if I'm wrong. 
   4) Map traversal is a joke, plenty of spots i should be able to get across the map or snipe from but invisible barriers and just flat out half of the map blocked off. If your maps need invisible walls all over the place let me tell you a little secret, your maps are shit. Its just a series of funnels with only 2 or 3 ways in even though I can clearly see many more ways that are blocked arbitrarily. Can't pass through gaps in bushes, cant mantle small walls, can't jump over certain walls, its a joke. This game isn't even about sniping anymore, aside from a few enemy snipers you can run the map with a pistol. The maps have very few areas that you can sit there, spot and take out a lot of the guys in the area, draw more in and slaughter them like you could in SE4. CQB is most of what you do in this game now. 
   5) Survival mode is another joke in this game, Being forced to move with the CP is annoying to say the least. Having any semblance of teamwork seems to have gone out the window with now needing to use med packs for revivals. The maps are just crap and this goes back to it seems sniping with just a tertiary thought for this game. Run and gun seems to win the day.
   6) This is more of a side rant but you can really tell that who ever worked on this game has ever seen a gun for making a model of it, because they just gave them almost arbitrary values. I can hear people now ""oh that's just for balancing the game"" but there is still the fact the guns just look good and that's about it from a historical view.
   7) Ready for another rant? Invasion mode. What is the point to a game mode where you have a enemy sniper come into the game with NO disadvantages. There is no downside to being a Jager. You have no choice when an Jager invades the game but to try to camp, and if you camp for too long your position is revealed. You cant proceed with the mission because hes just going to come up from behind you.All the Jager has to do is camp an objective and he has pretty much won. The fact that they pretty much spawn on top of you also, if you are engaged in a gunfight with the AI when they come in they can be on you in 15 seconds and thats it game over, Its a joke. If you are playing on anything but authentic difficulty its even easier for the Jager, with the hud and map on. If the AI spot you you have a marker over your head along side of the fact that every sniper rifle comes with a air raid search light attached to each and every scope in the game. This game mode adds nothing but ball ache.  
   The longer i play the more broken sh!t I find to complain about. This game is just not fun to play, its just infuriating.

Pros:

Hey, it's a Sniper Elite game.  Frankly, it is about the same as the last game, but more of it.

Cons:

My only (slight) knock on the game is that the graphics and mobility aren't up there with the top AAA games. Because of the lack of mobility, it limits the opportunities for reaching what I would consider optimal sniping locations.

Another very small con is that when you walk up to SOME interaction points (e.g. where you can unlock a door or use a satchel charge) one is easy to select, while you have to move the character around a lot to get that option (e.g. satchel charge is easy, but unlocking the door isn't).

The game has some pretty solid play through, with a variety of ways to approach objectives, kill or incapacitate bad guys, decent weapons customizing abilities, and insanely accurate bullet ballistics (for those who play more challenging difficulties). Hell, they even accounted for the range your guns can be heard from, and bullet travel time in your shots.

The bad:
The game mechanics are somewhat of a downgrade from SE4. A lot of your character movements just don't feel as natural as they did in SE4, you can't use a proper toggle aim (tap the button and your character stays aimed until you tap it again), vehicles are more difficult to kill than ever (except for trucks), and the maps, although nearly excessively large, are partitioned off into sections in a way that's reminiscent of SE2 and SE3.

(July 2023) Movement mechanics have been much enhanced, as has ability to properly corner/kill vehicles. However, while a toggle aim function has been added, it is more accurate to call it a toggle scope function. It still doesn't match the versatility of the toggle aim function a player will utilize in SEs 3 and 4.

The ugly:
Lot of little bugs. You might fall on a fence and be stuck there. You might get stuck on, or even in, a wall, rock, or tree root. NPCs often glitch out in any number of ways. Your game will crash, freeze, or even lock up hard enough you have to reboot your PC. Sometimes part of the gameplay mechanics stop working (i.e. losing the throw arc display for aiming grenades and bottles, or having explosions stop dealing damage to npcs, or even from happening at all). This game needs some serious debugging and updating over the next year.

(July 2023) Many of the most annoying and most major bugs have been worked out. However, updates to the system requirements show that this game requires about 30% more robust specifications than was originally advertised. Additionally, some bugs still emerge, such as one which will randomly pause your game and force you to a desktop view (thankfully without crashing or quitting your game session). Often, these require unique tweaks to your individual system's settings to sort out, or to at least prevent from becoming major issues which prevent game-play altogether.

The truly annoying:
Customizing your weapons is pretty limited. Figure, by the time you've unlocked everything, you'll be choosing to use the Kar98k rigged for high damage, or the m1908 springfield rigged for extreme distance and bullet velocity. Only 3 rifles aside from these, and they're really meant for mid-range use.
Long shots are annoying for those playing Authentic difficulty for a few reasons. First, you have to hit very specific targets for them. Second, you may find a target at a greater distance than the Long Shot target, and shoot it----It will NOT register. I shot a boat at 800m on the first level, and because it wasn't a specific infantry whom you can only shoot at 730m from one spot only, it wouldn't register my shot. On another level, I shot a guy in a crane at 540m, and again, it would not register the shot because the guy is part of a cutscene destroying a train, and I had to shoot another guy at 460m to get my long shot instead. This happens all the time.
What you unlock in campaign play is NOT available in multiplayer, nor invasion. You have to play those independently to unlock abilities and weapons for use. Why? because everything has been sandboxed off from everything else for the sheer hell of it. I had a wonderful time getting use to my weapons in single player, went to play multiplayer, and discovered I had to start with basic beginners equipment, rather than being able to use the gear and abilities I'd already customized my campaign character for. VERY FRUSTRATING...

(July 2023) The addition of numerous weapons, and even the addition of upgradable components to specific weapons has been a major boon to SE 5. While this does allow more personalized game-play, sadly, some of the better weapons have been nerfed a bit due to complaints out of MP session players. This still leaves you often choosing to use just one of three rifles, even if you have the DLC rifles.
Many Long Shot issues have been resolved. However, Long Shots on cut-scene characters and vehicles, even if they are just as difficult, or more difficult, still don't count.
All game mode arsenals and character skins are still sandboxed. Strangely, this is not a total sandboxing of skins, only weapons and upgrade componenets. If you want certain cosmetic affects on your SP weapons loadouts, you still have to complete Invasion. Vice-versa. Yet completing SP campaign, or Invasion mode ranks, does not affect weapon and component usage in other modes, so you'll have to unlock it again. STILL A STUPID WAY OF DOING THIS!!!!

Overall:
As a sniper game in general, this gets about a 7/10. For a Sniper Elite series game it rates a bit lower...maybe a 6/10 for the series. A few months of tweaks, a few new weapons and customization utility packs, and maybe some merging of weapons/abilities across single and multiplayer and this game would get an easy 9/10. For now, though, I'd say it's a bit lacking.

(July 2023) Would rate this a solid 8/10 for Sniper type games now, and maybe a 7.5/10 for the series. The main issue now faced by SE 5 is not any of the above mentioned....It is the hackers and cheaters (view discussion boards for specific references). Unfortunately, this means if you try MP mode, you find yourself playing among many players who openly admit to using, or having used at some point, cheats. Rebellion either doesn't, or is unable to, properly deal with this issue.
The only other big issue facing this game is the very, Very, VERY, ABSOLUTELY IDIOTIC notion of sandboxing weapons and character skin loadouts between game types. It's obviously done as a means to keep you playing as long as possible, like pay-to-play games. However, Rebellion is unlikely to ever admit this. As such, get ready to slog through each mode to unlock your loadouts time and again.",1653574615,1689726907,True,2,0,0.529780566692352295,0,True,False,False

Sniper Elite 5 Falls Short: A Beautiful Shell with Disappointing Updates and Lackluster Content

Sniper Elite 5 had the potential to be a standout game in the series, but unfortunately, it missed the mark on several important aspects. Here's a breakdown of my experience, taking into account the game's positive and negative aspects:

Visually Stunning, but Superficial:
One cannot deny that Sniper Elite 5 is a visually stunning game. The graphics are top-notch, with attention to detail that immerses players in the game world. However, it quickly became apparent that the game's visual appeal was merely a façade, masking deeper issues that detracted from the overall experience.

Intriguing Invasion Mode Lost in Updates:
The Invasion mode initially piqued my interest, offering a unique twist on the gameplay. It had the potential to provide hours of entertainment. However, any enthusiasm quickly evaporated when I discovered that every update for new content required a whopping 60GB download. This excessive requirement not only proved to be a hassle but also strained my patience and ultimately diminished my enjoyment of the game.

Multiplayer: A Haven for Cheaters:
The multiplayer aspect of Sniper Elite 5 proved to be a letdown. Both console (Yes we know cheating on consoles is a thing) and PC players faced an onslaught of cheaters, ruining the competitive integrity of the game. The lack of adequate anti-cheat measures made the multiplayer experience an exercise in frustration and disappointment. It's disheartening to see the developer's failure to address this glaring issue, leaving legitimate players to contend with an unfair playing field.

Insulting ""New Content"":
One of the most infuriating aspects of Sniper Elite 5 was the so-called ""new content"" updates. Instead of delivering substantial additions to enhance gameplay, the updates merely consisted of three new items, such as skins and some weapons. To make matters worse, these additions were not even available for all characters (if rebellion wants to add skins at least please do it for all characters). This lackluster approach to expanding the game content feels like an insult to the loyal customers who were promised meaningful updates and improvements.

In Conclusion:
While Sniper Elite 5 initially impressed with its beautiful graphics and intriguing Invasion mode, it ultimately falls short due to its problematic updates, rampant cheating in multiplayer, and insulting ""new content"" additions. The game's superficiality and failure to deliver on promised improvements leave players feeling unsatisfied and betrayed. I hope that the developers take these criticisms seriously and make the necessary changes to provide a more fulfilling experience for their loyal customer base.

Now, I know there were some reviews floating around claiming that this version wasn't true to its sniping roots, but trust me, they couldn't be more wrong. This game is all about sniping, stealth, and it's seriously awesome. If you've been playing it like a run-and-gun shooter, then you've been missing out on the real deal. So, buckle up and let me break it down for you.

First things first, Sniper Elite 5 nails the sniper experience. The developers have gone all out to make it feel authentic and intense. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail is insane. Whether you're stalking through a heavily guarded enemy base or perched on a crumbling building overlooking a war-torn city, you'll be blown away by the realistic environments and the sheer scope of the maps. Trust me, it's like stepping into a World War II movie.

But let's talk about the gameplay, because that's where Sniper Elite 5 truly shines. It's all about being patient and methodical. You have to study the enemy's movements, factor in wind and bullet drop, and time your shots perfectly. And let me tell you, when you line up that perfect shot and see the slow-motion X-ray kill cams, it's like nothing else. You'll witness bone-crushing impacts and organs getting shredded by your bullets. It's so satisfying, and it adds a whole new level of realism to the game.

Now, sniping is the main focus, but that doesn't mean you can't get your stealth on. Sniper Elite 5 has a solid stealth system that lets you silently take down high-value targets and infiltrate enemy territory undetected. You'll have access to cool gadgets like silenced pistols and throwable distractions, giving you plenty of options to play it your way. The level design is fantastic too, encouraging exploration and rewarding strategic planning.

Now, let's talk replayability. Sniper Elite 5 has got you covered. Each mission offers multiple paths and optional objectives, so you can go back and try different approaches. And if you're up for some co-op action, the game has multiplayer modes where you can team up with a buddy and tackle missions together.

But, I'll be real with you. Sniper Elite 5 isn't without a few minor flaws. The enemy AI can be a bit wonky at times, doing some weird stuff that breaks the immersion. And there might be the occasional performance hiccup or graphical glitch, but nothing major that ruins the overall experience.

So, if you're into sniping, intense action, and methodical gameplay, Sniper Elite 5 is a game you don't want to miss. Don't let those misleading reviews steer you wrong. Grab your sniper rifle, dive into this immersive World War II adventure, and prepare for some heart-pounding moments. This game is the real deal, and I highly recommend it.

If others get a remake or a remaster then my opinion about them might change but to date this one has the best game and gunplay, together with the soft enemy body targets it isn't tedious to deal with the enemies by proverbially missing the required eye shot (or organ shots to be more precise) that was always present in older games before this one where enemies could literally take dozens of bullets to drop if you just kept missing which is the main reason why I can't really play them and finish them even though in the past having finished Sniper Elite 3 when I play 5 now and go to revisit 3, I wonder how I dealt with that at the time.

I think at the core of these games the idea of sniping is really an appealing one and again the core of the games: the shooting is good at least theoretically but having to deal with the enemy health and sometimes AI behavior that made playing the games frustrating I always felt older games could have been better in practice. I feel that Sniper Elite 5 has made these adjustments.

This game might be easier than the older ones which I don't necessarily feel is the case at least not for the wrong reasons but again it feels more organic and the gameplay isn't as frustrating as it used to be, so I think this game is a step in the right direction, basically it is just very fun to play and still requires skill, just the enemies feel better to shoot (lol) and the movement of the player character is a bit swifter than say previously in Sniper Elite 4 was the case. Like I can't understand why older games, which also had a lot to do in them and by not doing it; by not playing those games felt really like a pity and I can't fully understand why older games weren't this way as 5 is now. I guess it has to do with the image of the game that makes it very skill based but a game that requires too much skill can be very unrealistic I think especially if overall it feels authentic or is going for that authenticity.

Some other reasoning:

I saw this game had iron sights and it was from there on a direct buy for me, because I really like these Sniper Elite games but always felt that this aspect was missing.

Now the older ones will never feel the same.

Beyond that the game is good, simple as that. If you like sniping then this one is definitely for you. Subsonic ammo and suppressors included for more weapons than just the sniper rifles at least De Lisle sniper rifle. Submachine guns and handguns now have suppressors too and that's good as an addition IMHO.

The game has beautiful maps, like really nice and I also kept replaying the first mission here because it is just so much fun and something which in older games I think never was the case because of the feeling of just wanting to get over playing them because again due to the enemies feeling really hard to kill before that took the fun out of the gameplay. Here, again, things have changed considerably and I think for the better.

If you look at a video like this one:

Now SE5 is a big let down.

The developers always have some weird tastes when it comes to a sniper game. In SE3, they wanted us to sniper tanks...countless tanks. In SE5, they want us to do CQB.

Just look at the screenshots on the store page. Half of them are CQB or non-sniping fights. Why do I need to do those? This is Sniper Elite, not just some WW2 Agent game.

SE4 was nearly perfect. Everything was better than SE5.

Things that SE4 had done right but failed in SE5:
1. Level design. SE4 was a sniper game. SE5 is a game where you play a guy who kills an entire city of Nazis without having to be quiet.
2. Again level design. SE4 was way less linear.
3. Customization. SE5 DOES NOT allow stealth play until you are late into the campaign to unlock muzzles. SE4 had stealth rifles (with severely reduced damage, which tested the player's skills) from the start.
4. SE4's Karl's movement was way less clunky.

After the campaign I usually come to sniper elite for the survival, and it didn't disappoint.

Hard pass. Massive step down from previous games. Don't bother with this one.

-Imagine a game titled ''Sniper Elite'' but you use melee, pistol and smg 90% of the time. Yeah. Most encounters are close range, you rarely get to use your sniper. This was the biggest let down about the game.

-DLCs. My god. Curse whoever invented this ''DLC'' nonsense. If you buy the standard version of this game you only get access to like a quarter of the actual existing content. Most of the missions are behind a MASSIVE paywall. DLCs are like x3 times the price of the base game when combined. They took it way too far with this game.

-Broken AI. It seems to me the germans share a telepathic connection because soon as you make the slightest disturbance you will be swarmed from all sides. Oh and they will aimbot you with a pistol from a hundred meters away. They never seem to miss. On any difficulty. 

-Unclear missions. On three seperate occasions I had to look up on youtube where to go because some missions are really obscure. No indicators or anything just wasting my time running around not finding it.

-Mission 9 is a joke. It takes literally 10 seconds to complete. You just shoot one high profile target from afar and it's over. They should've just included that in the end of mission 8 after a cutscene. Are they trying to boost up the number of missions by doing this? 10 SECONDS for the whole mission. How is this justified? I'm amazed.

-Shallow characters and weak story ruins the immersion. I personally cared nothing for those 2 girls I don't even know remember their names. They add absolutely nothing to the game and just kinda hang around. They were just your typical strong female character I guess. Yeah, a black woman in year 1944 is an elite, well trained, high rank spy working for allies in WW2. Well done. That's what I'm looking for in a sniper elite game dude. Hell yeah.

-Invasion. They apparently added this multiplayer system like in dark souls where you invade other players worlds and try to kill them. No thank you. I turned it off after my first encounter. Game is already hard enough for you to get invaded by some sweat with hundreds of hours to hop in and grief your game. I'm good. Plus you can't save/load or even pause the game while he's in your world for obvious reasons. Just an inconvenience I'd rather avoid and instead play my own little solo dolo stealth action game.

Conclusion:
Extremely overpriced. Not a bad game per se but completely forgettable and average passtime. Nothing more. You won't be missing much if you skip this one. Just not worth your time nor your money. Disappointed.",1689171118,1689171118,False,103,6,0.725657403469085693,0,True,False,False

The AI, well, if you played SE4 you know what to expect but one thing they added and i liked was the ability of the AI to see your scope glint; Enemy's combat dialogue is much more immersive, plus the soundtrack which is different on each mission.

Now the bad, really bad: 
All dlcs mission suck big time; 
They made the mosin nagant a paid dlc and even so it is a poor weapon compared to the kar98k and springfield; 
Every patch is about 50 Gb and you have to wait for it to download. By the way, everytime a patch is released it introduces more bugs by fixing others, it is like there was no play test;
Few enemies on the maps to keep your busy;

update 11/04/2023: guess what? They released a patch that prevents EVERYONE from playing the game, it simple does not go past the Rebellion logo!

update 07/11/2023: So this is the end, final content was released. No M1 garand; they made us pay for the Mosin Nagant; Frankly, dlc missions that are no better than some main ones, plus overpriced; Pre-downloaded dlcs that you can't get rid of them even if you don't own them.",1653575517,1689121990,False,0,0,0.528680801391601563,0,True,False,False

[b] Brief: [/b] Buy this game whenever it's on sale is my best recommendation. I do not feel the game lasts long enough to deserve it's original price, but to each their own I suppose. Now this is my first ever Sniper Elite game I've played, gonna try the fourth one next so keep in mind I don't know if this game is an improvement or not from the previous one but I will say it was a lot of fun to still play. The sniping felt good and the x-ray slow motion effects were awesome. Story was okay, nothing too boring but nothing too exciting, however it's pretty easy to complete the whole story in just a few days sitting. Also I dont care for Invasion so I have no idea about that mode.

[u] Positives [/u]
[list]
    [*] Great map designs, really open space to move around
    [*] Sniping feels good, not terrible
    [*] Trying to do stealth can be satisfying if it doesnt randomly screw up on you
    [*] You can get most of the achievements
    [*] You can shoot men in the groin
[/list]
[u] Negatives [/u]
[list]
    [*] Base game story feels a little short
    [*] Overpriced DLC for a couple more missions and weapon skins...
    [*] Can't get all the achievements without buying the Season Pass DLCs
[/list]

Runs well  on my RTX i5 Laptop! 

Some notes of point I wish the movement was a bit more fluid as sometimes it lets the action down when you can vault over walls without prompts for example or areas of  the map are restricted simply by invisible barriers .

 If players know Sniper elite though this is not uncommon. Play and enjoy if you like sneaky third person games with a slice of tension and shooting mayhem.

It feels to me that the devs want to make Sniper Elite into Hitman - especially notable in the Hitler mission. Different ways to kill him and all that. Unfortunately it is instantly obvious that SE doesn't have the gameplay features, the intricate maps nor the narrative elements which make Hitman great. So you're left with an ok stealth shooter where you'll have on some maps trouble to find any sniper shots above 100m.

There are also other elements that don't make sense - for example I haven't found a use for decoys yet. You can also sabotage parked vehicles, but outside of a few scripted events the NPC don't use them at all, so why even have it in the game? It also features the 'modern' DLC policy of ""two weapons and a skin for 10€"".

It also has a lot of solid features, like the gun gameplay, lots of customization, the way in which it handles exploration, how you can tailor the difficulty exactly to your liking, but compared to its predecessor it is unfortunately a big step back.",1688785808,1688785808,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main campaign consists of 8 missions in various locations, with main objectives and optional objectives. The maps are not 100 % open world, as you have to follow certain paths in some of them, but you are free to play it however you want. You could go non lethal, stealthy or go in loud. On top of a really good campaign, you also get the following modes:

Coop - Play story missions with other players
Invasions - Invade another player and try to take them out, or the other way around
Survival - Defend command posts with other players against waves of enemies
PVP multiplayer - Various modes of standard multiplayer with levels and stuff to unlock

I barely touched the PVP as it's not really my cup of tea, but i played a lot of hours of survival and coop missions. Only had good experiences, and people were friendly and helpful. It was easy to find games to join, but there are no servers, so keep that in mind. If the host leaves, the game will end.

But i do have one negative about the game, and that's the season passes and DLC's. As of writing this review they are way too overpriced for what you get. You only get 5 extra missions, and only 2 or 3 of them are decent. Included in the season passes is also skins and new weapons. If i were you i would purchase the main game first. If you liked it and want more, and maybe get all the achievements, then get the season passes on a really good sale (Like 50 % off or something) Or buy the mission dlc's individually.

The DLC missions i liked the most were Wolf Mountain and Rough Landing",1688740051,1688740171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fewer weapons, Worse customisations. Waaaaay too many challenge or gimmick guns. The kill challenges borrowed from hitman are more annoying and harder to get than the ones in 4 and sometimes essential parts are locked behind them. For a game set in France there are only 2, maybe 3 French guns. They even tortuously contrive a reason for Japanese weapons and troops to be in France and do nothing with it. A handful of officers to kill and two guns (three with dlc) from Japan and what did they pick? The Type 100 submachine gun that can't be fitted with a suppressor and the Nambu (the worst production gun of ww2). The DLC adds the Terra rifle some weird low power paratrooper rifle that can only be fitted with  a handful of shitty scopes. Woo! I guess the Japanese forgot to bring the Arisaka rifles, the actually decent rifle with real sniper variants. And i guess the germans forgot all their P38s so every officer has a Luger and every soldier has an obscure french pistol. 
Sorry got on a tear there. 
Can't swap your gun for enemy guns in the field anymore, no more S-mines or trip-mines. 
Enemy AI seems somehow smarter and dumber. Better at tactics under fire but brain-dead pathfinding. Every tank in the game is now a King Tiger but don't worry armour-piecing rounds will kill one in three hits from the back. Oh but the driver is now invincible. 
Look this game is perfectly fine, hell i played it for 89 damn hours. But having played 4 i can't help but see how in basically every way this instalment is inferior. And as far as i can see they stripped out a whole bunch of stuff for no reason, put in a heap of BS that would only appeal to streamers and even with the overpriced dlc still haven't restored the missing content.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
Do you not see the issue? Do you see the DLC packs with their reviews? MOSTLY NEGATIVE or MIXED.... the only thing that is positive is the base game... I wonder why. The sheer GREED of REBELLION nowadays is damn right disgusting. They lock weapons, missions and maps behind a paywall. There is no other way to obtain these weapons in the game unless you pay for them. If you want to truly see how greedy REBELLION has become look at games like Zombie Army 4, Sniper Elite 4 and Sniper Elite 5... they MILK us players dry. Instead of polishing their games they release content constantly leaving behind a plethora of issues in their wake that they DO NOT care about. 

[h1][b] REBELLION please... please stop stealing our money. Take the hint from your playerbase. Stop pushing out content like there is no tomorrow. You give us nothing but take everything from us [/b][/h1]",1653551461,1688666063,False,2,0,0.561003446578979492,1,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Satisfying kill cam like always.
+ Guns customization, although a bit underwhelming.
+ Spec-friendly for low PC.
+ Challenging achievement for completionist.
+ Every mission is beautifully crafted.
+ The amount of gameplay is about right.

Cons:
- Brain-dead enemies. AI just awful.
- Multiple season pass? Really? Also expensive.
- Multiplayer is dead.
- A bit dull in term of mission objectives.

I enjoyed it but found there to be more ""personal engagement"" with the enemy rather than out and out sniping.  I suppose it's possible to snipe every enemy if I really wanted to but that definitely would have taken longer to complete the game.

- The story is bland (solo agent singlehandedly penetrates Nazi strongholds and disables a WMD).
But... It holds things together.

- The freedom is annoyingly restricted - maps are just patches of gameplay in a LARGE map, but connected by narrow paths that artificially confine player movement. It's annoying that a small hedge holds you back, and you can't climb in/out trenches, and you cannot jump... Not at all. So many things look entirely traversable but aren't.
But... You get used to it, and at least you can *shoot* all across the map. Which you sometimes need to do, and albeit artificial, it keeps you from too much running & gunning (at least on higher levels because you die easily).

- They say the sniping is ""authentic""... But you just press ""space"" and a useful diamond comes up that assists in headshot after headshot even at extremely long distances. And there is x-ray vision for enemies you saw once, which makes it incredibly easy to plan a route and stay undetected, just as long as you have patience.
But... Yeah, shooting is fun.

- The enemy AI is one of the most braindead AI's ever in a game like this. They see five of their buddies getting headshotted in a building doorway, and they think ""hey, maybe if I walk through the door as well, I catch the sniper, hey you know what? let me LOUDLY yell ahead that I'm coming through as well"". It's ridiculous. They are alone, and they loudly yell to their imaginary friend or to me, the sniper, just to let me know they're there, so I can take them down with great ease. They don't listen, they don't look around, they don't work together, they don't take cover, they don't change weapons, they don't take strategic positions, they don't create funnels, they don't draw me out of a hiding place (except from the odd grenade), they don't cover each other, they don't care at all about their wounded buddies, they glitch and look/shoot through doors and walls...
But... No, there's no but for this one. The insanely terrible AI is, for me, by far the hardest hit on the immersion, and made me ragequit often.

But the maps are gorgeous and large, and the environments (especially the indoors) are detailed, chaotic and very well done. Even if traversing chokepoints is often extremely artificial and limiting. It's fun mowing down countless numbers of bad guys in a combination of slowly scouting from the edges of the map, and then barging in and having hectic firefights in maze-like indoors quarters, churches, science stations, armories etc..

I'm not military, so I have no idea if this is is anything like sniping at all, but ""authentic sniping""? Nah, absolutely, definitely not even close.",1688230499,1688230621,True,32,3,0.735499024391174316,3,True,False,False

I had a few glitches but I would still recommend this game. I found it to be fun and it's as challenging as you want it to be depending on the difficulty you choose. This game can be played in full stealth or all out Rambo or anywhere in between.

Pros:
-For the most part, huge, intricate and at times gorgeous maps
-minimap features for detection/investigation/combat/hearing range slightly improved
-didn't have a single crash to desktop like on SE3 and 4, though I suspect that's more DX11's fault on the older games.  YMMV.
-25h campaign if you're chewing the scenery, at least that's what I got playing on default (medium) difficulty.
-Killing Nazis never gets boring. Replayability is subjective, but there's multiple starting locations you can find on each map, collectibles, workbenches, etc.
-Flanking AI seems slightly improved, though it's a mixed bag when the AI is already somewhat dumb.
-Like most games, it's undoubtedly a completely different experience with any form of multiplayer (co-op, invasion, etc.)
-some modes and options completely new to SE5.

Cons:
-AI is still Snipe Elite AI.  Its iterations improve in some aspects and remain dumb as a box of navel lint in others.
-Mission 9.  Yes, it qualifies as a mission, with a designated, clear objective, but really, this should be an epilogue not listed in the individual mission list considering it takes 30 seconds to complete.  Feels like a massive tease and a slight disappointment at the end of very satisfactory iteration of SE considering how much time I was able to enjoy in the other missions.

Mixed/Subjective:
-You don't get all the weapons and attachments up front.  You earn some by completing missions, earn others by finding workbenches and earn still more by completing certain challenges within missions, like kill person X with this method, etc.  You still have everything you need to get by.
-If you like SE, you'll like another iteration in the franchise.  If you demand an authentic sniping experience, like every other time, this is more arcade/shooting gallery-like, with stealth elements, and at times gets closer to a third-person version of popular FPS multiplayer franchises...but you have the ability to play how you like, which is good, and there's no immediate fails for being detected, which I've always thought of as a red flag for any game.
-I'm not a fan personally of any type of Pass model (Season, Fast, Pass/Fail). Rarely is the supposed discount vs. the individual DLCs worth it.  Value in this is entirely subjective however.",1672967545,1688104504,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you didn't like the last few games in the series, you'd probably like this, if you for whatever reason actually did like 3 or 4, then this should be amazing to you.",1687831339,1687831339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

its a cake walk to do..
would be awesome to hard a harder setting... still miss it had more challenge on authentic 

plus i still dont get why what should be hard got empty lung assist... it takes away to skill of the game.... its like taking dark souls and setting all enemy hp to 1 while they cant deal damage....

Campaigns can be played in a variety of ways as determined by the player which alleviates boredom when playing them repeatedly. Skin packs add variety and interest. Weapon choices are limited and needs expanding. Photo mode is great - it allows a screenshot to be manipulated with photographic tools such as depth of field, aperture, and camera height and angle. Survivor mode is challenging and really tests your skills. I have not played invasion mode or multi-player yet - long overdue! There are much less bugs since first release. There are still some bugs but they're minimal and don't ruin the game. DLC campaigns are much too small and need considerable expansion (compared to SE4).

It's Crossplay so you can play with your friends on consoles or different platforms, so that's cool. This is the first Sniper Elite game realistic-feeling ballistics in it, it's not dead-on or anything, but the bullet flight time, the lead, and drop are pretty legitimate to where you won't question it, though the wind is a bit extreme.

1. The game has false chokepoints like what Hell Let Loose suffers from (the map seems bigger and more open than it is). 
2. You can adjust your zero, but the increments are shoddy beyond 300m with big gaps between the different ranges on most scopes, making it basically nearly useless to engage beyond 300m regardless of how much magnification you have (that's fine, but it could've been better).
3. If you equip a suppressor, the already-dumb AI is broken unless they see their friend get hit or get killed, or they get hit themselves; the game basically plays itself. So I don't use suppressors.
4. As already mentioned, the AI is dumb and will go out of alert after a certain time rather than continue to track and search for you, regardless of difficulty.

I bought this for Axis Invasion and multiplayer and basically, on Axis Invasion, the Allied sniper/s get wall hacks (Focus mode) on any difficulty lower than Authentic, and Allied sniper/s can get AP ammo that can penetrate 4-6 feet of concrete with a standard rifle (so there is no such thing as cover for the Axis Invader), while the Axis invader can reveal location every few mintues, after the first 5 minutes or so have passed. I played a game a few moments ago where my location was revealed 6 times in just a few minutes before I could reveal his location even once with the invasion phone. Also, most people in Axis Invasion try to get kills with secondaries, handguns, or throwables/traps, so you're rarely going to get that Enemy At The Gates experience. One last thing about Axis Invasion, you cannot filter for players of the same or similar difficulty, which would be nice. Also, photo mode wrecks this Axis Invasion when people won't play honorably and they still haven't addressed it.

A good game of Axis Invasion requires these things:
1. people who don't use Photo Mode to find each other
2. an axis invader who goes seemlessly between stealthy and blending with the AI troops
3. an allied player who doesn't use Focus mode (Authentic difficulty)

I'd give it a 5 or 6 out of 10, MAYBE a 7 out of 10. The game feels rushed and they keep focusing on DLCs instead of addressing bigger issues or Quality of Life things and it will always be limited by being a third-person shooter.

So far my max distance shot was around 250m but most less then 100m and 90% close quarters kills.

One BIG tip to anyone playing for the first time... make sure you ""use"" the workbenches you find in missions even if you don't need them.

First of all, no it's not just sniper elite 4 but more, they improved A LOT.

It can be a bit short with it's to few missions, but the ones we get are still very fun and varied, with interesting paths to take and positions to snipe from, so just for campaign this game would be worth to buy on sale.

Where it truly shines tough is the invasion mechanic. It gives you tools and is balanced in such a fun, asymetrical way, that actual irl sniper tactics really work and are worth using in PVP, like never staying in the same place to make it harder for the enemy to stop you, predicting enemy movement and laying traps, etc. 

And unlike most online games, there is no real meta here, this is primarily a battle of wits between two players, and smarter one will usually win regardless of gear. Good invader can track down and hunt the invaded and hunt them like an animal, but the good invaded can turn the whole round into a horror game for the invader. I love this game, you won't find anything quite like it anywhere else.

Also if you're just interested in it for the PVE or coop experience, the survival mode is also very entertaining, and let's you not only blindly shoot at enemies, but also set traps, find good defensive position and manage your resources, so even if pvp hunts are not your thing, you will still find enough content for yourself.

Regular symmetric pvp is pure garbage tough, if you just want pure non-invasion PVP play something else",1686241068,1687043580,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But I ended up playing the game on ""another platform"" and really enjoyed the experience. Once my subscription ended and I lost access, I picked it up here on Steam. Played through on Authentic and felt the core gameplay was still the excellent style one expects from the Sniper Elite series. The changes were overall good (except I turn ""invasion"" off because it's really a bad idea) and the maps were really inventive and interesting. Even playing through this game twice now I still find it enjoyable and discover new things all the time.

One minor thing to note: Getting the Authentic achievement is not so prestigious anymore because you can save scum through it. Older Sniper Elite games made you lose your character if you died. Having said that, I did a full Authentic run without dying so it's definitely doable even with the changes.

The slo-mo on kills is drawn out way too long; it seems to be twice as long as that on SE-4.  The destruction of tanks and armored vehicles has become overly difficult due to the position you need to be at in order to make the multiple shots at exacting points of each vehicle using only armor piercing ammo.  The lack of ammo / explosives to be found or gleamed from dead bodies can often necessitate undertaking a search for 15-30 minutes or longer to find what is needed: armor piercing ammo, explosive to open a safe or door, and just adequate ammo to continue toward your goal.  Overall the missions are fine.  The low ratings received on most all of the DLCs have kept me from adding any missions to the game.

Only Women In WWII Battlefield Were Russian Snipers.(Throwing History Book)

The Graphics:
Backgrounds Were Incomplete In Later Maps Like Rubble And Ruin.
Weird Shadow Outline While Climbing.

The Gameplay:
Assassin's Creed Open Scenario With Call of Duty Grind.
Workbench And Weapon Requirements Added 11hrs To A Retold Story of Sniper Elite V2 of 9 Hour Story.

The Bad:
Authentic Mode (Bullet Drop Was Extreme And Logically Makes No Sense)
Felt Like Shooting Rainbows or Ethos Bullet
Historical InAccurate
(France Did Not Help America)
Higher Score For Kocking Out Nazi's Vs Sniping 500m Away

The Fun Factor:
10/10

Replay Factor:
10/10

The Conclusion:
If James Bond Was In WWII This Would Be His Origin Story.
Please Do Not Do France or Japan.

If you can start the game at all (lots of reports that people can't), and if you play without crashing (lots of people complaining about crashes), and if you can put up with bugs that are being ""looked into"" for months, and if you can run the game long enough for memory leaks not to send you crashing, then you can play.

Survival mode is a disappointment, lacks the luster SE4 had for replayability, and has coding issues where sometimes poor spawns or out-of-bounds vehicles end your game.  Also too few maps.

The maps are beautiful in most cases, but there is repetition (designer laziness) in some of them and you are not as free as you'd like to be.

Wind effects do not compare with SE4 unfortunately, and also there is no authentic plus mode, both of which make the game less challenging than most would welcome.

Weapon modifications are too complex and silly, too overdone.  And some weapons that should appear do not.

The game is geared towards console warriors, and the game is cross-platform.  PC Steam users do not get the attention of the developers in the forums.  The most you will get is some lame acknowledgement (sometimes, not the majority of time either) that they read the issue, then you get told to contact support, who does nothing in most cases.

Updates are still 40 GB and up, all the time.  ""We are working on it""

Most maps are not sniper-generous.

I enjoyed the single player campaign, but replayability is not as good as SE4.  It is replayable, but not as good.  If you play multiplayer, be prepared for a host of cheaters and disappointments there, IMO mostly because of all the console action that is now in the game.",1685666887,1686696666,False,55,2,0.702634572982788086,0,True,False,False

Well for a start off, I've just finished it in under 30 hours on medium difficulty. Let that sink in, I am useless at this sort of game, and I finished it fairly quickly (for me, anyway).  There wasn't much challenge, if I was noticed by the enemy, I could just get into a massive gunfight, taking out 11 or 12 guys who knew where I was and were gunning for me.

The game play is good, Karl doing Karl stuff, sneaks, stabs, long range sniper shots. It gives a good amount of sniper locations, and the kill cam footage is always fun. 

The story is weak, though. the bad bitch resistance leaders were pointless virtue signaling and diversity hires. i got bored with it about half way through *skip* and just focused on the game play. 

I played it through half-way by myself and then started over with a friend. i enjoy the co-op play a lot more. It's nice that it is cross-platform, he's on a PS5, i'm on PC. 

Some of the fun traps from 4 are missing, like the trip mines, and the schu charges? knockouts that hardly do anything to Jagers, stagger them a bit. There is a heavy XP reward for not killing your enemies, but this is an elite sniper game, so blowing peoples heads off is kind of the point. 

There seemed to be a lot more character customization in 4, too. maybe there is more with more DLC, but i bought the deluxe version, and nickle & diming me to death for a skin seems greedy. 

I completed the whole game with the gewar [sic] rifle, and that was a good choice. I liked the weapon customization work tables. nice addition. 

The last mission... maybe this was to ""Tie up loose ends,"" but it felt weak. It would have been better to have some plan, or some obstacles to overcome.

The install size is huge 93gb for deluxe version, but I think a lot of it goes to assets, mainly for graphics because the game world looks really good and there are many objects and buildings and they look different even though of course they're also reused in other places.

The most important thing is improvement from previous series, it can be a good and a bad thing because that way the latest will ofc be the best and there is no urge to get the previous installments. It's like they're competing with their own existing games and replace it with the latest. 

The one improvement I like the most is Enemy AI. In SE4 if I snipe someone, enemies will be alerted and the second shot will always reveal my position. So it kinda beats the main feature of the game as a sniper, the game has melee, pistol, submachine gun and rifle so I can use any of those to defend myself while the enemies are alerted . In SE5 enemies have better status (I think SE4 also has it but simpler). In SE5 the statuses are Clear, Investigating, Searching, Combat. If it ever reaches combat status but I manage to kill the enemies engaged fast enough, it will go back to clear status. That is the biggest improvement because then I can snipe again. Esp if I use rifle with the lowest noise range. So far I managed to stay in stealth all the time in all missions that I have played (1 and 2), while still be able to kill any enemy as I please. I still have to wait a bit to cool down depending on situation, but not too long.

The whole experience is very atmospheric, the music, the sound effect, the chatter, the graphics, this is the only game/genre that I'm comfortable walking slowly in stealth most of the time without needing to rush to go somewhere (unless I know I already clear the area). The game world is big but not too overwhelmingly big. It's the right size for each mission.

There are also rpg elements (I forgot whether it's already there since the previous series but I think it's new or already in se4), for skills. Not too important though but it helps.

As with other sniper elite series, bullet time showing slow motion kill when the bullet penetrates enemy body part never gets old. Especially when it's a difficult shot from great distance (enemy has helmet and micro movements). And loading a save file is really fast like in seconds. There is also quick save and quick load buttons, it feels like savestate in emulator games, can just load when messed up and back in action in just seconds.

Price is a bit steep as others also mentioned. So wait for a discount. It's still too expensive to buy all even at discount though, but the deluxe version should be enough for a while, and buy the rest at later discount event.",1686031634,1686148745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Again, great game with a solid fan base, but most people want to enjoy it solo or with a friend.

Think the game could use an option for a camoflauge in your loadout you could pick between a few style that work better on different surfaces while some are more specialized.

- The game can be passed without killing anyone (except those who must be killed as objectives - would be nice if that was tackled as well).
- Very beautiful. Lots of attention to details.
- Sniper rifles have a new distance based aiming mechanic. Still it's a far cry from what Sniper Contracts offers.

Cons:
- Plastic faces. I've never seen so bad faces in a AAA title. Crysis from 2007 looked better.
- Horrible terrible stupid AI. I'm playing on authentic and it's just not there. AI won't see you when you're right in front of it. AI will however spot you when you're crouching 50 meters away.
- Not a lot of new stuff if any in comparison to previous installments.
- IRL something that's guarded is guarded at all times. Without ifs. That means it's ridiculous that you can sneak in almost everywhere without being spotted.
- I can pick up a fourth gun which is the same as mine but with better modifications or the one which is not yet available, why? I can use it. If I switch to my own primary three guns, this fourth gun is dropped. What the hell? Found modifications are not unlocked by picking better guns.
- Enemies popping out of thin air. This happens e.g. when you destroy objects and you have enemies ""sleeping"".
- Not enough traversal freedom. Too many areas of the game are blocked seemingly for no reasons.

They added a few new features which surprised me but in a good way for instance they removed the golden skins and replaced them with camo varients which are unlockable by finding a workbench or achieving a specific amount of kills. One of the things i like alot about this franchise are the unique maps they out did themselfs definitly an improvement from their latest release the vr version which i assume has smaller maps because of the vr technology not being great yet.

If you'd like an idea of a game with life and activity in it, go play Ghost Recon Wild-lands then come back to this and you'll see what I mean. This game is depressing in comparison.

Con: a bit linear and I would like more cp-op as opposed to multi player. Perhaps future DLC's will improve that. Add the overpricing and I don't recommend - at least not for full price.

Splitting off a second season pass sounds like greed to me, unless the content is **exceptional**.[It' wasn't / isn't] so far. No discounts for 2 on the spring sale, either. :(
The second mission of part 2 would have to be **very exceptional**l to warrant the price, and frankly, I don't believe it will be, going by the rest of DLC content so far.
Sniper Elite has been an auto-buy for me (a double one as I get two copies) since 2, but I will NOT pre-order 6, if, indeed, I buy it at all. The quality of the missions has deteriorated, which makes the high price that much more difficult to swallow. It will take a discount and some quality content to bring me back. It's a shame, really, I really liked Rebellion, before they got greedy. But this game, as much as I want to like it because of the accessibility, just isn't up to four and the DLC's are far too expensive.

Do not recommend either Season pass. $30 for two missions and a handful of weapons & skins when the main game can be had for less than &20 is excessive.

The Good:

-Options for days for configuring your guns and loadouts
-Interesting new take on survival mode, once you beat one there are different base options
-Longer and more involved single player missions than the base SE4 missions, feels more like some of the dlc missions from SE4
-Elite snipers no longer have heat seeking laser point accuracy like in SE4
-I really like that if you pick up an enemy weapon, you get what's left in the clip and then discard it.
-Tanks can no longer be shot and destroyed with a simple sniper round.

The expected:

-Allied characters are wooden cutouts with no personality just like in SE4. This time they just amped up the diversity. At least you can skip the cutscenes.
-AI can be janky: enemies can magnetic snap to cover 10ft away sometimes. Enemy soldiers stupidly exit their sidecar despite having a mounted machinegun they are leaving behind.

The Bad:

-While the gun options are cool, the progression system is completely tied to the single player missions, for a game with 3 distinct game modes, why always force players into one mode to progress?
-Despite these choices, it almost feels like there is always one correct upgrade path for each weapon.
-Base game guns are quite limited, I think there are only 5 non-dlc weapons
-Elite enemy types running with MG42s seems a bit over the top and cartoonish. Why not go back to the FG42?
-The speed at which wounded enemies instantly pull out their pistols is cartoonish as well
-When finishing up the third wave at a base, the instant spawn mechanic is kind of lame, really should've just let you run to the new base like in SE4
-DLC prices are insane. Seriously, twice the base game cost for both season passes?

I think that's everything. Overall a good game but not as good as the fourth game!

The idea of some rando coming into my single player game and forcing me to change my preferred slow and methodical gameplay style seemed like a terrible idea. The cool thing about the invasion mechanic is you can set it to friends only, or turn it off entirely. That's what I did for my first playthrough of the campaign. I had a blast. The invasion mechanic is actually really cool if you want to play through the game again. I'm in the process of getting all the achievements and medals currently. It's fun to have others turn up in my game and give me some fun PvP interactions. It's also to load into someone else's game and try and slowly hunt them down. The 4 person survival modes are a ton of fun. They really bring out the fun in using some of the secondaries provided. My campaign playthrough was mostly rifle for distance, pistol for close quarters. Survival was the SMG's and shotguns time to shine. I don't really have an opinion on multiplayer matches, I've not really played much of any of the game modes.

The problem has been the postlaunch support; two season passes worth of content and a succession of major technical updates have brought myriad problems as well as destroying the core balance of the game. It's reached a point where I don't enjoy playing it solo anymore, and where the enjoyment I get out of it comes from being with people I love. And you can get that from any game.

It's a bizarre situation, the game has been downgraded quite comprehensively from launch.

I didn't have any issues with bugs at launch, but now the game routinely crashes on me. The general idea is to patch your game to fix issues, not to create them...

Gameplay is great in single player and multiplyaer but the community has its downsides
people will try and votekick in MP due to crossplay and the console PC skill divide but the prestige system is nice, i just wish there were more players

WE NEED MORE TEAM DM MAPS!

the bugs are there as with all SE titles it could use a bit more polish but it is still fun and the detail of the maps is awesome.

WE NEED MORE MAPS IN MP there are 7 maps and it gets redundant after a few games especially when people vote for the same 3, for a game with so many large stages you figure there would be more maps available.

the shooting feels responsive but the guns are also limited as well as the change to the items. it makes the weapon selection feel small.

AI bodies fall through the terrain.

Sabotaging power boxes and then sniping does not seem to mask sniping gunshots?!

One soldier spots you and all the others in the area immediately know where you are. It's not a good stealth game if you want to remain completely stealthy due to pretty much everyone in the area pinpointing you even if one soldier spots you after you have killed them.

A few optional tasks are added to each mission, as well as a new kind of task: Kill a named guy within the area using as specific way. This can be via an explicit gun type or to e.g. throw somebody in wet concrete. 

I have completed each mission with all side missions, which took me 21 hrs - whereby this includes the sneaky gameplay. If SE is played like a shooter it will be most likely way shorter.

Graphics are, as well as the Music/FX, good and the story is also better as in the previous parts - even though most of the parts are not historical correct.

SE5 is also the first part in the series which came 100% uncut to Germany, which increased the immersion a bit, too.

The most defining feature of Sniper Elite 5 is just how insanely big the maps are. Some of them are not only massive, but also incredibly detailed and impressive. I spent an entire 3 and a half hours on the first level alone. It's honestly surprising just how jam-packed full of content this game is.

The weapons are interesting. They chose a really weird selection of rifles, with 1 of the 6 not even being a rifle, one being an SOE prototype and one being a somewhat obscure French rifle. There´s an attachments system too that is actually fairly useful for optimizing different aspects of your guns. I made an M1 Carbine for myself, stripped it of all of its powerful features and slapped a suppressor on it to bring its audible range to about 30 meters. I´m sure it can probably go even lower if you play around with the attachments more.

It feels like the sniping is more realistic than before. In Sniper Elite 4, at about 100 meters you'd have to scope almost a full head length above somebody's head to hit them, but the large aim adjustments you're used to are much more subtle in Sniper Elite 5. You'll have to adjust for bullet drop and wind over long ranges, but to nowhere near as great an extent as in Sniper Elite 4. Overall, it feels more realistic and less arcadey.

For some reason the devs felt compelled to add a skill tree? I really don´t know why, as none of the skills are important and you´ll unlock them all in a few hours anyway. Were we meant to think hard about how we spend our skill points? Since you unlock everything so quickly, what´s the point of even thinking about it? Why does it matter if I unlock slightly higher lung capacity now or later? Why bother adding these faux RPG mechanics? My whole interaction with the skill tree was: ""Oh, I forgot this existed. Whatever, let me just unlock this shit I guess."" Why bother adding it? Or XP? Or a levelling system at all?

The story is once again just ""evil Nazi general is making a device that will end the war yesterday, it's up to you to stop him!"". I particularly loved how every single level had an objective where there's some kind of device that you can overload by pressing two buttons, then said device explodes and Karl goes ""There, that'll slow down those Nazi bastards"". And when I say every single level, that's surprisingly not even as hyperbolic as it sounds.

Lastly, the invasion gamemode is really interesting. You either invade someone who´s bleeding to death in a field surrounded by Germans on all sides and just blow his head off with ease or you invade someone who´s been dead quiet all game and have to wander the map looking for any sign of him, hoping that you find him before he finds you. It´s one of the most fun multiplayer stealth games I´ve played in a while.

For some reason though, there´s an anti-camping mechanic? In a game about sniping? If you sit in one spot for a few minutes, the game will mark you so the other player can find you. It makes sense in that it prevents the player from just hiding in a bush somewhere and being nigh impossible to find, but I hate that I take up a position overlooking somewhere I know the other player is going to go through, only for the game to fuck me over and mark me for him to see. Surely I should be rewarded for having the patience and the basic deduction to recognize that if the player just completed an objective to my north and now needs to complete an objective to my south, they´ll have to pass through a certain place and that I can see said place from my position. But no, fuck you, you´re camping, suck my cock.

One last thing: Karl suffers from severe unable-to-shut-the-fuck-up syndrome. I get it, people in real life think about things, they have an internal monologue, so it´s realistic for them to have an internal monologue in game too. Unfortunately, I don´t give a fuck if long grass is good to hide in, or if the scopeless rifle I just picked up does not indeed have a scope. Karl loves to make useless observations and there´s really no need for it. You pick up an SMG and he´s like ¨Hmm, this SMG could do some damage...¨ Like, what? Grizzled war veteran picks up a gun and his first thought is ¨Hmm yes this gun can hurt people¨. After 100 hours in game I don´t need the main character to mumble that long grass is good to hide in or that a scopeless rifle is still useful.

All in all, there's nothing really wrong with it. The level design feels like a huge step up, the gameplay is more or less Sniper Elite 4's and the story is, again, less memorable than a conversation about washing machines.",1653780308,1683672579,True,0,2,0,1,True,False,False

It was alright - but get it on sale.

+ Maps are huge and detailed (except for the final mission).
# It's barely a sniping game - think of it as an FPS with a stealth element, and where one of your rifles is super accurate.
- There are ""skills"" you can learn, but they are nearly completely useless.
- I played the entire thing with the same weapons I had at the start and maybe one silencer mod. While there were different weapons and mods to get, they weren't any better than the ones you start with - the alternatives always had significant downsides. This is the biggest fault of the game. 

It was clearly built for multiplayer - this explains why all weapons are pretty much the same. They should have had a different set of weapons for single player if they were obsessed with keeping all rifles nearly identical for multiplayer.

Terribly disappointed with how they handle community feedback (basically they don't give a fuck while pretending they do). They have a community manager in the forum replying to player threads ""your feedback is very much appreciated, it will be passed to the team"". In reality the same feedback is then used to wipe the dev team's asses.

A common complaint you can find for this game, especially for the DLC maps, is [b] there are not enough enemies in the levels [/b]  Some maps, even the larger ones,  are basically a ghost town which makes the game:

A) boring 
B) too easy 
C) pointless to stealth through, even though this installment puts very heavy emphasis on stealth and close combat.

During the past year after the release the devs have NEVER addressed this. Instead they continued to release expensive dlc map packs which have EVEN LESS enemies placed than in base campagain. There is no point mentioning the rest of the issues with the game if a trivial thing like copy pasting a few enemies onto a level is far beyond them.

I don't recommend you to buy it. It has some good qualities but also glaring problems that the developers choose to ignore.

not the open world do it how you like game you maybe use to 
invisible walls bushes or chest high walls you may or may not be able to pass , you see a nice vantage point in the distance a hill or bell tower probably wont be able to use it ,maps are divided is kinda stages or sections like having 3 loaded mini maps and objectives 

why is everything trying to be WOKE
if your here for immersion or historic feel you are SOL 
did you know black held most the leadership role in the french resistance and constituted around 1/3 to 1/2 of french resistance ...
did you know as a leader of the resistance the best way to not attract attention by the Germans in small town in France is to be a black mix race Irish specking woman that may or may-not be LGBTQ+, 
also all woman are strong independent bosses that don't need you and when you do the missions they chastise degrade and its just expected that you do it shut up and let them do the planing ... save someone no she was just about to kill her captors ... 
honestly if you don't need or want the protagonist there make a different game if your main character is just there as a aren boy with no respect then it feels shitty to play this game

Third Person Stealth games, or stealth games in general have always been some of my favourite genres in video games and by all intents and purposes, I should've really enjoyed Sniper Elite 5 but for some reason I never had that itch to keep playing it.

Sniper Elite 5 is a game where you assume the role of Karl Fairburne, an American-German Sniper on the side of the allies who helps turn the tide of the war in France 1944 through the games own inner plot set around the events of the historical D-Day.

The gameplay is what you'd expect, sneak around, line up your shots, hide bodies and collect intel. You are truly a commando in every sense of the word.

One of the best aspects of the game are the level design and missions. The maps are not massive but they're not small either, they are packed with things to do and each level feels meticulously crafted by the developers to an astonishing level. Although you have your main objective every mission there are an abundance of side missions as well as a few different difficulties, I imagine the replayability of this game is great and you could definitely get your moneys worth. 
There are 9 missions in total and each can take between 60 and 150 minutes to complete. Definitely bang for your buck.

There are multiple ways you can complete each mission, sometimes its just blowing something up, sometimes its breaking a production line, there are several ways to do things as well as multiple enemy types and loadouts that can suit your playstyle. 

If I'm being honest with myself, I genuinely don't know why I didn't enjoy this game. I was the same with SE2 and SE4. For me something just feels off and I would like to make a disclaimer that it is just the way I [i] personally [/i] feel about the game. I just never clicked with it. I felt no urge to hit launch and when I was playing it I wasn't getting any enjoyment out of it. It felt like a chore just so I could get a review out and be done with it.

I got halfway through mission 6 before I said to myself. ""I'm just not enjoying this and I don't know why."" I genuinely don't. The game ticks every single last box but I guess I can just say that I'm not in the mood for this game right now, that's the only thing I can think of.

I will not be giving this game a rating as I feel that it is unfair but I will be bold enough to say that I do recommend this game to people who enjoy the stealth-shooter genre.

I will come back to this game when I'm in the mood for it and see if I can complete it.",1682277350,1682277350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sniper Elite 5 has it's flaws and drawbacks, don't get me wrong. Yes, the map design is on average subpar to that in Sniper Elite 4, with some of the levels being particularly frustrating to get through (*Cough* Level 6 *Cough*). Yes, it was odd for Rebellion to remove the trip mine and S-mine from the main game, and yet keep them inside Multiplayer. And yes, this game doesn't give you as much of an opportunity to snipe as much as the previous games, which is a little weird. But with that said, it's still a pretty good game in my mind.

1. Story
First things first, this game has much better characters, and a better story compared to anything that came before. Karl is a little bit more interesting than he was in Sniper Elite 4, and actually has pretty decent chemistry with all the main characters. Speaking of them, Charlie is a decent enough buddy for Karl, but be warned because she might have the single most aggressive Scottish accent in any character from anything ever.

Other than them, Marie is a pretty good character who ties them to the resistance and sometimes helps provide transport, although not being super interesting. And Moller is a good villain who bears a likeness to the douche bags in charge of the Nazi Regime.

For the story, Operation Kraken might just seem like another evil Nazi super weapon, and it is. But what really sets it apart from what has come before is just how insane the actual plan is. I wont spoil anything, but the whole game is worth playing through just to find out the awesome conclusion of exactly what it is.

2. Gameplay

Sniper Elite 5 might not have as good levels as Sniper Elite 4, but it does make up for it in the new things it added. For one thing, this game added Invasion mode, which is a wonderful way to play through the game if you don't feel challenged enough. The game adds plenty of new weapons like the SREM-1, Welgun, and RSC 1918. I for one think that it's an interesting idea to add non-lethal kill methods, since it's a really good way to get XP. Some of the levels are pretty well designed, such as levels #2 and #7. \

There are several different ammo types, all of which are useful for different situations. And of course, weapon customization might not be realistic to the period but it is a really cool factor. 

3. Conclusion

So, in the end Sniper Elite 5 might not be an amazing game, but I do believe that it has many strong parts. I would recommend to get it on sale, since I'm not sure that it's worth the $50 (but to be fair, I'm not sure that Sniper Elite 4 is worth $60).

8.2/10

I hope that if they make Sniper Elite 6 it will take all the good stuff from this game, and the good stuff from the last few games, and put it all together to make the perfect game.

Until then, stay safe, drink water, hug your loved ones, play this game, and have a nice day. :)",1682124597,1682124981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

because every 2 weeks you essentially had to re-download the whole game as an ""update"" I've literally never had or even heard of that happening . A game brought to a dead stop by file size updates. The message boards and responses were huge to stop it, but they ignored everyone until the player base left, then went into panic mode and now literally broke the game completely for most of the players that were left.
REbellion was my favorite developer, ZA,SE3,4, Strange brigade ect.. But ZA4 left a bad taste in my mouth and this disaster is one of those so huge that I'll likely ignore their future releases completely. That partially depends on if this is ever playable I guess, 100 bucks for a game I never even got to finish ,cant play and barely came with any content and they want me to purchase what they did release?

 . Rebellion still has some weird, confusing issues though that are a nuisance .
First the good, some, not all the maps are amazing. The replay value will be great. The 3rd map ""spy academy"" my favorite . I won't go into tons of detail but generally quite fun.
Not necessarily ""bad"" but more like ""why? what is going on""
Odd ""open but not really open"" world with very confusing barriers to stopping you. Way too much time spent going ""oh I cant climb over this part of the wall but here I can"" Tons of "" can't climb through this window even though its open"" Sometimes you can hang of an edge ect. You really never know until you try.

World items completely still lack interaction so you often get stuck navigating around small objects like chairs and smaller instead of being able to push them. It also makes explosions extremely lackluster. Throw a grenade into a room with an enemy results in a dead enemy and a perfectly stacked set of dishes and glasses on the table still. Duke3d 25 years ago was more interactive.

Though weapon customization is back, it's still ""meh"" with nearly every ""upgrade"" doing more taking away than adding to your weapons functions. 

Lack of sound masking like 4 where some maps you spend more time doing melee kills then actually using a gun. 

Lastly, survival maps arent that great. Theres SO much potential !!!! I know they add more every time so I really hope they do a better job. Sometime I feel like Devs spend so much time thinking about making a game challenging or other technicalities they forget the ultimate goal is for it to be fun.  With the game supporting 16 players they really are missing modes that could be amazing ( i thought for sure invasion was going to be 8 on 8 allies invading axis.)",1654546898,1682026636,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game suffers from multiple limitations as well as being a bit buggy: Enemies showing up, looking away for a second, then looking back but they are not there?  Walking up to pillage a body, but if you stand too close, or at the wrong angle, you lose some menu options.  Very limited in movement as you have to follow very distinct paths, and cannot open many doors or leap barriers right in front of you.

I'm not a massive fan of the franchise, but 4 was pretty good fun on medium difficulty and it felt like you could sneak around until you cleared the map and the world was a happy place. SE4 made it clear what you could do with the environment and you could plan around it. SE5 on the other hand, is very ambiguous.

There was one section where I thought I would walk upstream to the waypoint. Upsteam had an invisible wall in it so a pretty glaring break from immersion as my character moonwalks in the water against a glass case of emotion. The game also doesn't really reward you for playing clever. It just descends into run and gun like a third person shooter where you're flailing around murdering waves of Ze Germans who teleport out of the woodwork screeching Achtung! All the cool trip mines and ambush stuff is pretty much missing. It is a little confusing because I'm not really understanding how the game should be played. Maybe it doesn't know either. AI also is pretty woeful. I was standing in a stairway while Jerry is moonwalking against my character model, until I mercifully kill him in melee and put him out of his digitised misery.

Oh and if you're into playing games for the story, please be aware that WW2 is very progressive now. ""The Message"" features heavily.

I read the negative reviews previously and just wanted everyone to be wrong. I waited til it was $20 AUD on sale.  I wanted to like it. I tried turning a blind eye to its faults. Logically, you'd think each iteration of the game would be an improvement. This one doesn't seem to be it, Chief.

Life is too short to be playing badly designed and implemented games.

OH - and non-lethal ammo and on-lethal mines feature in a game about murder from afar. Offensive to all snipers everywhere, I'm sure.",1681716816,1681716922,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Bottom line is that I experience absolutely no pleasure in playing SE5, and that’s a bummer!!!
Maps are ruined, I really don’t get why devs did this, forget about the free path you get in SE4, in SE5 you are encouraged to follow pre-determined paths, you have to walk and walk and walk to go from zone A to zone B because there are no-go zones blocking your path forcing you to constantly go around them.

AI NPC is just terrible, sometimes with absolutely no sense at all.

Game mechanics feels just strange and unnatural.

Sniping at most maps is unfortunately not the way to go, instead you are encouraged to play more in the style of Hitman.

Sure, there are great things, the visuals are great but at the end of the day, I would rather play SE4 and that sums it all.

While it does include various rifles and plenty of open areas for shooting, this isn't really just a sniper game. Karl is a commando, through and through. You'll be sneaking around hostile territory conducting guerrilla warfare against the Germans, sabotaging enemy equipment (coastal gun batteries, AA guns, comm equipment, etc), gathering intelligence and assassinating officers. There are a bunch of different ways to complete each mission, including both ends of the spectrum. It is a lot like Splinter Cell in that way. You can sneak around without touching anyone, you can just knock them out (why not kill those nazis?) or you can ventilate them with your blade. Naturally, you can also engage at all ranges with various firearms. If sniping isn't your thing, there are submachine guns and pistols that are perfectly viable in combat, especially now that you can aim down the sights. CQB with a Thompson is definitely a treat. 

A lot of care was put into making Karl shoot and scoot in a realistic and period accurate way, including his usage of the fighting knife melee kills and the way he reloads his weapons. 

It's a cool game, and definitely nails that espionage vibe. The Axis Invasion mode is a lot of fun, too. Definitely give this game a shot. If not here on steam, then try Gamepass.

- In a vacuum, sniper elite 5 is a ""decent"" game.
- Compared to Sniper Elite 4, it's a bad game.

Why?

- Map's are prettier but not open world. Way too many invisible walls or things you cant't jump over, each map really only offers two or maybe 3 direct paths to follow. This makes the best part of the game (Sniping from long distance) naturally harder because you can't get on that hill over there that you want to, no you have to climb this specific building they put right here. SE 4 gave you WAY more freedom and options for long distance sniping.

- Weapon upgrades are a cool idea, but don't make a big enough difference really, I always end up just going for muzzle velocity, and as quiet as possible. Even then most of the rifles are just too loud. Now this would be fine if the maps were like SE4 because you can almost always go over 100-200m away from the enemies but in SE5 you are semi guided on a path, there is FAR less room for long distance sniping. This felt more like Splinter Cell where the majority of kills were either stealth take downs or pistol shots. Why not call it Pistol Elite 1 instead.

Main Point : Sniper Elite 4 was awesome because you could CHOOSE to be a up close pistol man, or that guy that finds the furthest possible point and then sits there and takes out 1/4th of the map, then moves to another great natural spot. SE5 does not give you that same freedom. It has a tiny bit of it, but it's just way more forced and ultimately that's the complete wrong direction they should have gone in. 

I still enjoyed the game, I like the B movie campaigns they are silly. I didn't personally find this game woke, I think adding non lethal options is good. Choice is good. Unfortunately overall SE4 had more choice than SE5, and ultimately that's why you should buy that one and play that one instead.

I really hope SE6 goes back to the more open world design. It's the difference between a just okay game and a great one.",1681374042,1681374042,False,4,0,0.520999133586883545,0,True,False,False

We have waited a long time for this, the 5th in the SE series. 
Numbers 1 and 2 were very clunky, 3 started to get a lot smoother, 4 remains one of the most played games in my library.

But SE5? 
I'm 5.6 hours in at the time of writing, finished the first mission, started the second and I haven't tried multiplayer yet.

But the graphics! They seem to have taken a backwards step.
Perhaps I should crowdfund for several brand new graphics cards?

Gameplay has suffered in my opinion. Little things like placing a satchel charge. You have to be in exactly the right place or no dice. Similarly picking items up, if there are two close together you find yourself swapping your gun for something you really didn't want or need. 

I paid up front for the game pass and can't see any of the additional missions or weapons promised. Am I missing something there?

All in all a swing and a miss so far. I'll keep playing it through and I will make it into multiplayer once I've finished the campaign.

But I'd love to see those weapons and missions.

EDIT: 255 hours in.

So the missions are all finished, the last 5 of the awards are yet to be collected, many guns and tweaks have been unlocked.

However.....

It still feels very clunky. 
Multiplayer (not co-op) is very linear. Scope glint is always on, hacking seems rife.
I'm looking at profiles with level 40(max) solo play and level 50(max) multiplayer play and the player has 40 hours in-game?

Whatever happened to the Easy Anti-Cheat that auto-loads with the game?

Summary is still this: For the cash I paid for it, the sheer acreage of area that has been made available to play in is fantastic. The graphics and gameplay is still clunky, the multiplayer maps are limited and fellow players are deserting it in droves to revert back to SE4 to play there until many more of the bugs are fixed.

EDIT: 478 hours played.

Well bugger me gently. I've just downloaded the latest patch (11th April 2023) and now the game doesn't get past the copyright screen.

I've tried verifying the file integrity, restarting Steam, rebooting my pc, switching to Vulkan, all the things suggested online and in the SE5 discussion pages.

Nothing.

No joke, that might about be realistic.  With about as many enemies in that first level alone as in all of SGWC2 . And there are 8 bigger and vastly more complex missions in SE5 (and a small one).
[h3]Update: They are currently throwing all that credit for good value for money away.  by now the first season pass is through. It was ok. The missions included were few but big and well made. BUT now Season pass 2 is  sold for 25€, half the games price again. It promises only TWO missions, the first is out and is apparently very underwhelming in size I absolutely don't care or see as value weapons and skin packs.   So what i said about not milking as much money out of the game does NOT extend to their current DLC policy. Season Pass 1 ok, 2 way too expensive. Wait for 50% sales. Update end[/h3]

 Also SE5 doesn't have SGWC2's 20+launch Weapon and Skin DLC.  So instantly a better look and less exploitative feel.  But of course SE5 was just begging for a (completely avoidable) shitstorm by gating the usual kill-Hitler DLC behind pre-ordering. Will they ever learn?

[h3]Edit after finishing: SE5 (40hrs) is a MUCH bigger game. Levels are not just more and bigger, but also more interesting and complex. 
There is the odd glitch on top of a ladder when you can't get off, and  2 or 3 jumping ""puzzles"" the movement system is REALLY not build for, but all in all no technical issues.

SE5 is basically more of the same as  SE4, Which is perfectly fine with me and what i hoped for. For the many good things,a bit less for the few issues. Apart from those, gameplay, ui, graphics are all as good as ever. [/h3]
Issues like the still very limited movement and object interaction systems. Like(no)  jumping or moving gas canisters (aka bombs) to strategic locations. Or using doors...  Instead still concrete canisters and some impenetrable obstacles that don't feel like they should be. 

A clear and completely unnecessary change for the worse is the new, very limited weapon pickup system. I absolutely don't understand why they did that and what was wrong wth just swapping your weapons.  That makes no sense.
You can still pick them up as 4th, temporary weapon but they are just dropped when switching to your loadout ones that you can only change at workbenches to very few unlocked other ones Those are at least nicely customisable.

I don't care much for the new online ""Axis invasion"" feature. I guess it's a nice option to have if it works and doesn't get annoying. Can't judge, have it off. Only annyoing that some items are locked behind that feature.
 On that topic a big bonus point for just having a simple checkbox option to disable the the Easy Anti Cheat spyware*. Instead of needing launch parameters, file renames or no way at all. Forcing EAC down your throat (unnecessarily!) has become a absolute pest in recent (mostly) single player games

This game is truly a step above the rest in the franchise. The default FOV is better, and the ability to adjust it is welcome. The way the character moves, the controls and default keys for interacting are much better than previous titles. It's so much better I struggle to enjoy SE4.

Then along came SE4. What I noticed straight away was how much of an improvement SE4 was over the Hitman games.
The stealth system, and all the associated mechanics were much more satisfying.
Having played SE4 to death, I was looking forward to SE5.
Then the Steam reviews came out for SE5 and it appeared to be universally slammed as having taken a backward step.
These reviews put me off purchasing, as it's easy to believe that a developer has lost their way, and haven't made the necessary progressive improvements to the game.
Typically, therefore, I waited for a Steam sale, and bought SE5 then.
Within minutes of playing, I knew it was a faithful improvement on SE4.
The automatic snap-to-cover when in crouch position was exactly what I wanted from a stealth game.
The weapon customisation, the dialogue, the graphical realisation of 1944 France are all of the highest order.
Wait for a Steam sale by all means, but don't be put off by negative reviews.
In short, Sniper Elite 5 was everything I had hoped it would be, plus a little bit more.
Buy with confidence.

Rebellion delivered!  

It's more SE4 but even more gorgeous (except that distracting AA shimmer) and with lots of small enhancements, like 'focus' where, when especially close to enemies, you can press focus to gain a faint outline of where the enemy is on the other side of a wall or barrier.  It's a bit of a cheat and you don't have to use it, but I liken it to assessing where someone is by their footsteps - so yeah, I'm using this!  Other new things include weapons now carrying an indication of hearing range.  If a rifle has a hearing distance of 130m, you need to be at least that far away from the nearest enemy for your gunshots not to not be heard.  Even the trusty Welrod suppressed pistol can be heard within 14m by default, so it's not quite so much of an easy way out in this game!  The game now offers workbenches in the locations where you can upgrade and swap weapons mid-mission (love this).  You can now sabotage vehicles as well as generators to mask sound, though nuisance soldiers will insist on poking at the noise and trying to fix it as in previous games...  There is the polarising addition of non-lethal weaponry and attacks - polarising because why wouldn't you kill off someone wearing a Swastika?  But it adds a new gameplay option, and you get more points for non-lethal combat.  Polarising yes, but you have total freedom to play how you want - and who doesn't want extra choice in a game?!  Finally, you can now also upgrade Karl as well as your weapons - by earning skill points, providing enhancements such as the ability to carry more ammo, or to automatically mark an enemy that takes a shot at you.

The maps are again HUGE with plenty to do and to find (each, when played properly as a stealth operator, taking several hours to complete - easily 7 to 10 hours for me per map).  I'd estimate the title divides game-play into around 60% sniping and 40% close-quarters stealth (or combat - choice is yours).  A lot of reviews are panning it for not enough sniping and there probably is less in this one, but it's also a lot to do with how you play.  Like the previous games, you CAN run-and-gun, but the way you're supposed to play is to scout out some suitable vantage point (if lucky, with sound masking) and pick off enemies at distance.  Unfortunately, the story, map and objectives unwittingly steer players straight into direct routes leading to close quarters combat and that's probably why there are so many complaints about lack of sniping.  Ignore where you're supposed to go next.  Take your time, pick high points, mark enemies through your binoculars, and pick them off at a distance.  

Along with the good is a little bit of bad too.  Karl's impediment for climbing over small walls is back (he really suffered this in SE3 too).  This time, the 'wall' might only be an ankle-high pile of pebbles around a tree and the gap looks easy to traverse, but nope, Karl cannot go there.  He cannot climb low rocks, squeeze through what look like decent gaps in hedges etc.  It's a tad frustrating.  I get why it's been done but I think, in SE4, it was better disguised by blocking off no-access routes visibly with barbed wire, fencing or other obvious barrier.  Another issue is trying to interact with things like opening doors or picking up ammo.  There seems to be some issue where you keep having to spin round and find a perfect position to trigger the interacting prompt and, if you're in a hurry, this is beyond maddening and ideally needs to be fixed.  One thing I DON'T like: if you opt out of playing ""Invasion"" (yes, players can land right in your game and kill you), you earn less points.  In my opinion, a game mode should be able to entice people to play without gating game rewards behind the feature.  But that said, even without invasion points, you will ultimately find enough points to unlock all upgrades before completing the game.

The AI is a bit hit-and-miss.  Sometimes, creeping up on a foe unseen launches the red COMBAT! alert without you making a sound, and other times, the AI can seem a bit confused and bewildered before shrugging their shoulders at the dead body in front of them and assuming it was nothing.  It's not ALL the time, but it does happen here and there. 

The NPCs are a little bit wooden, but they always are in SE games.  There's a nice mix though.  You'll see complaints about some, like the black woman you first encounter because ""unrealistic"".  I have NO time for people who whinge about this sort of thing.  It's a fictional game with fictional characters and a whole fictional resistance.  If it was realistic, then Karl would be kicked out from the off given his lack of fitness, huffing and puffing after 10 yards of running and not even able to hop over a short stone wall, so...  I like what Rebellion has done. 
 Why can't Rebellion fictionalise it as much as they want?  I 100% support their decision and welcome it.  I can count the number of games with a black female primary on the fingers of one hand from 40 years of gaming which is shameful, so it's about bloody time!

People are commenting that bullet physics are a bit off.  I only play medium difficulty so wind direction isn't a biggie for me, but it's worth bearing in mind what others are saying.

Final criticism others make is a greatly pared-back selection of weapons.  That's true, but honestly?  All the hundreds of weapons in the previous game were just clutter and most were not used.  The weapons in this game might be fewer, but they vary in a meaningful and interesting way.  I almost feel like I've had MORE choice because the differences are greater (whereas in past games I just shrugged them off and played mostly with the default load-outs).

So, should you buy it?  If you enjoyed SE3 and/or SE4, then an absolute yes.  It is more of the same but with enhancements.  If however you found the earlier games repetitive, you'll be no better off here either.  It IS more of the same and, for that, I'm very, very glad!",1654191876,1680863617,True,4,0,0.553215324878692627,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the pros: Weapon customization is good even though some are a bit ridiculous. Invasion is the best part of SE5 its great fun with friends. Probably the second best improvement in SE5 is the story line, its more in depth and creative. The maps are aesthetically more pleasing (i wish there was some terrain variety) the maps are more expansive. The multiplayer maps are better and in my opinion more difficult. I like the weapons, i feel like they're pretty well balanced i havent noticed any of them that are OP. 

Now for the cons: The sniping is worse in most ways it doesnt feel as much of a sniper game compared to SE4. I think it feels more like other WW2 games which to me is a bad thing, if you like to run n' gun its definitely better than SE4 at that but thats not what Sniper Elite players want. They want something that they can push their skills and methodically take out nazi scum from 400m away. Another down grade was the traps, theres a lot less variety now you have to collect bottles instead of throwing rocks. A land mine rarely kills people in invasion and multiplayer. One of the most annoying thing is all of the invisible borders, it limits a lot of stealth. I wish they made a few different variants of builldings such as the churches.

I could keep adding to pros and cons but thats just of it, a lot are disappointing in the sniping which is obviously important. Its a good game but was a disappointment at the same time its taken away from the niche it had as a mostly sniper/stealth game.",1680709595,1680709595,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

I wont be buying the new season pass. Most of the issues bellow haven't changed. Rebellion have killed the SE franchise for me. 

This is now a dip in game for me at best. 

***

After playing several hundred hours on this game, as wells after several  40-50gb updates, I stand by my original overall opinion. This is one of the worse coded games I've ever played, and they had the cheek to declare it GOLD before release. 

It has lots of potential, however as it stands now i would only just pass as a beta version.

- Invisible walls all over the map. and Ironically, places where you can shoot through walls and tanks etc. 

- Inconsistant landscapes ie: you can jump over railings in certain maps and not in others, even tho they appear to be the same type/height etc. Same with shooting through wood. 

- Glitches galore including Mines don't go off or go off without making a sound. Or they go off when you are no where near them.  Enemy snipers and tanks track you through walls. 

- Grenades don't throw properly. They will randomly end up anywhere but where you throw them. 

- Wind and Bullet drop are a joke. 

- Melee system is retarded. You cant melee from the front unless you have a bayonet, and you can melee people before they are even anywhere near you. 

- Survival is far too easy even on Authentic. Abundance of supplies, gormless enemies, highlighting enemies when you get 5 left. white boxes and exclamation marks appearing over their head so you know where they are. 

- Ridiculous features such as Focus - basically a built in wall hack. At least give us the option to turn it off in multiplayer. 

- No dedicated servers leading to toxic noobs who will kick you for shooting them.
- Annonymous votes so people will just keep spamming the vote button with no accountability. 

Lots of potential. There are some good ideas in the game but Overall a let down over the previous SE series and has clearly been dumbed down for the next generation of gamers.

 Ive paid for it now so i will keep playing it but don't buy it unless it is on sale.

A massive let down. SE4 is basically all I play so I was looking forward to SE5. 

I don't mind bugs in this stage of release. It is to be expected (however how thoroughly was it tested given that bugs appear in the first few minutes)

Graphically it is excellent. I like the weapon customisation feature. Shoulder aim has been eliminated and there are different aim options. But that's where the good ends. 

As well as small but very annoying features being removed, this is basically a watered down, overly simplified SE game clearly aimed at the younger generation. The Sniper Elite veterans have been forgotten.

- Movement and interaction feels clunky and not smooth and fast like SE4. Almost like everything is microscopically slowed down. 

- Authentic mode is a joke. Enemies are highlighted (on survival), You get red exclamation marks over enemies in campaign so you can then see them.  No wind until later missions in campaign (why?! just why?!)   If i wanted an easy game I would choose an easier mode. Bring back the standard of Authentic plus in SE4!!!

- They have removed unlimited stones (which in reality would be readily available) and replaced it with limited supply of glass bottles! How bizzare and random is that! Why would a sniper carry bulky bottles that clunk around rather than using stones? An idiotically bizzare feature. 
 

- Multiplayer movement and game play looks and feels like fortnight, its lost the speed and atmosphere of SE4. 

- Also they removed the option to see the game rules, ie: when you enter a server to see what they have turned on or off. Useful feature that is no longer there. 


Overall, despite the excellent graphics, this game is just feeling dull and lifeless compared to the others.I don't mind the fact that many people say its a copy of SE4. That would have been excellent. In fact I would have welcomed new SE4 maps rather than this SE5. 

And its not nostalgia, I was ready for a whole new challenge. This has been a major let down. Especially for the cost. 

I hope further updates change some of these features.",1653944525,1680551409,False,316,16,0.817701637744903564,43,True,False,False

Pros:
The graphics are improved over SE4, just gorgeous.  Stop and look around you have time the enemy wont hurt you.
Crashes seem to be less
I do appreciate the quick save button, this is something other publishers need to utilize instead of locking it so you have to repeat hours of play when you die.

Cons:
AI is way to easy on authentic level, its about 50% easier than SE4 there are also less enemies, stealth is not necessary just blast them all.
Story line is basically the same and it seems the story writers cannot get enough of U-Boat pens as they are once again front and center in this version.
Disappointing that one of the mission where you glide in with other rangers you dont actually go into combat to help the allied invasion could have been a real fun adventure battling with the airborne in Normandy.
The progression of leveling up is so weird the weapons actually get worse as you gain more and more pieces to your weapons.  I left them on the first level and found little need to change them.
Picking up enemy weapons like the Mauser k98 an excellent sniper rifle can only be used till it runs out of ammo or worse has to be dropped to use any other weapon.  This is not realistic.
Enemy snipers are too easy to kill out past their range they wont even fire at you but you can kill them.
Carl also likes to give alot of advice like ""time to move"" most of the time its not accurate, I wish you could turn it off somehow.  Weird your inner voice giving erroneous advice and then you dont follow it.
The campaign has a shelf life of 25 hours, so plan accordingly.  Not alot for your money.
Truly the worst part was the removal of the trip mines/booby traps for these schu mines ridiculous, part of the fun was making the enemy run down a gauntlet of traps you lay before them.

Would I buy it again sure I bought it on sale.  I would not pay full price for it.  Pick up SE4 which is better.

The main character is annoying.  He tells you everything you're supposed to do.  Even when he's supposed to be quiet.  Sometimes you're in the wrong spot when his voice triggers so the advice falls flat.

The quests are annoying.  Everything in the game is either 0 or 10 in difficulty, there really isn't any in-between.  Either you need to blow up a bunker and there's a satchel charge right outside it, or you need a crowbar and you spend twenty minutes searching before you find it.

The minimap gets cluttered easily and there are bugs in how the map and minimap work.  For example, it will tell you to hit return to track something, but actually you need to click on it.

The controls themselves are very weird and difficult to get used to.  The first mission does an absolutely terrible job of introducing new players to how to use them.  Apparently there's different types of ammo.  It's not made clear what they do, because there's no description to go with their name.  You just pick up different types of ammo.  It's not easy to track how much you have.

So while on a deep sale I feel like the price I paid for the base game was worth it I would not suggest others purchase the extra content or even purchase this game until either they fix the amount of content in this game or you see it on cheap sale and its well under 50% off. Maybe then they would push out a complete game with more than 8 missions and enough guns to go with it. If there was a neutral button on steam even more so with a wait for sale check box I would in a heart beat pick those. However on steam there is only YES/NO for recommending the game. I would have to say no I do not unless it is on a extreme sale. The day they start putting in the content and then doing proper paid expansions if they really want that particular profit model... is the day I will give them a good review. If you want paid expansions then the expansions have to bring as much of the base game as the price they are. If you sell 30 hours of content for 60 and then charge 10 bucks for a DLC then it better bring every single min. of 5 hours of solid content. If the base game is 8 missions for 60 and the DLC is  15 bucks for some missions then I better see 2 full missions out of it being 1/4th the price of the base game then I want truly 1/4th the content. Not a mission that says it is a mission for the sake of it.  (No I mean FULL FLIPPING THING) If paid expansions and DLC have to be a thing take a note out of the witcher that is the only game I have seen to get that right. 

((edit) after playing the game) I will have to say there is a lot of good about being able to customize the guns so much. However there is a relative lack of them less than in sniper elite 4 more than sniper elite 3. (least compared to how much I have played of 3) they kinda force you into buying several season passes and buying guns one pack at a time. I do like a few free guns and skins they gave out but i feel like It was because they had to not because they wanted to.  Another thing I would like to add is the last mission number 9 is not a full mission I do not want to spoil it for people who have not played the game yet but it is not even close to a full mission. In fact you can complete it in about 30 seconds. To call that a mission is insulting. So what you get with the base game is this. 
1. series of 8 missions - the 9th is not a mission objectively speaking. 
2. highly adjustable but severe lack of variation and number of guns in the base game
3. Some of the maps are much much bigger and have much more replay value than others to a degree that is kinda hard to describe. 

What I think stands true for this game and I think for sniper elite 4 as well but not to this degree is as follows. 
They made a fun game they even improved a lot on the prior however someone pinching pennies says well take this , that, this, and that out of the game and we will sell 1/15ths of the game for 1/4th or more of the retail price of the base game. OH BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE ... why don't you buy more than one season pass to get a deal on all the content we stripped out....It is in your face cash grab. look at the reviews of the additional missions (DLC) you can purchase they are not worth the price unless on a very deep sale. This feels like penny pinching turned worse where up till now they have gotten away with it. However they are not taking your lunch money too and it long past has gotten old. Long story short here is that I think a lot of people would be willing to pay a bit more for the game or would even expect slightly less from each new title in the series if the games were actually new / had all their content/ a full game worth of content. Some of these missions are new. Some levels are amazing and truly massive while others (about half) are not quite so much like that. With how many guns are in the base game and with the size , scope , and replay factor of the missions there it feels like they took too much out of the game and gave a few things back to appease the customer base with the ""free"" DLC -- why is it even DLC if it is free than it should of been in the base game. Some of the skins probably came later so sure just push a update and everyone has it. Point being is I have no issue with them have extra paid content as well as in general making a profit. I have a issue when it gets so in your face and as well as down right insulting. It is kinda like if you went to the movies and you bought a ticket, then you paid 10x to much for popcorn but the popcorn toppings are a paid DLC. Then you pay to get way too much salt in turn making you thirsty so you go buy a overpriced drink. After all that when you go to sit down and you feel 10 lbs lighter cause your wallet is empty you go and try to recline in the new recliners and there is a coin slot asking for another hand out for you to do so again. That it sniper elite 4 and 5 in a nutshell just 5 is even more in your face and bad about it. With 4 it felt in your face but with 5 it feels like they are in your face about it and then they even go as far to reach in your pocket for your wallet for you as a service. That is what I am displeased about. 

The missions are similar to sniper elite 4 but in some ways better. One annoying thing is looking at the map it is pretty easy to cover objectives and stuff you want to look at with popup boxes on other aspects of the map screen. Combat is pretty good and there is more vehicles on roads and stuff and makes for a heck of a time setting traps and you are much more likely to encounter scouts and patrols. Overall the additional patrols and scouts really make the levels feel more alive and unique. I like that aspect very much although it is not the only aspect I like. The thing I like most is customization to guns and the fact you can find special weapons in the levels and you can even pickup and shoot MG42s as well as there is the added anti material rife and the standard panzerfaust. There may be even more special weapons but I have only done 2 missions so far. I have yet to encounter any vehicles other than trucks, motorcycles and a few variants of cars but hopefully more will come in later missions. Generally I think this game is a improvement while at the same time not a overall improvement to sniper elite 4 as some stuff really did not change. There is tons of good improvements as well as the weapon customization's are amazing. Gives levels much more replay-ability when you can customize your weapons so much.  

The bad: They added yet more season DLCs and there is like 2 season passes it daft way worse than prior games and my stance is still the same the DLC should be in the base game.

I enjoyed the game and would recommend it if you enjoyed previous Sniper Elite and Zombie Army games. Dropped down to Normal on my first playthrough because for some reason I couldn't shoot straight at first. Only played the campaign, haven't played any Season Pass content yet. 

The main campaign was shorter than I expected but the missions and side objectives were what you'd expect from a Sniper Elite game. AA guns, lots of them. Nazis too.

Sniper Elite 5 reintroduces armour piercing ammo which makes dealing with armoured vehicles a lot quicker. There's also non-lethal, subsonic and match grade ammo. Can't say much about the new ammo types as I haven't really used them enough. Takedowns now offer a lethal or non-lethal option. 

Each map has 3 different starting locations, the default locations and two other locations that you have to find and unlock. A nice feature that allows you to mix things up a bit.

Rocks are replaced with empty bottles. No longer an infinite supply but you can find empty bottles all over the map. Throwing a bottle at an enemy's head will knock them unconscious which is handy and neat.

Truck engines can now also be used for sound cover, just like generators. Alarms are also new-ish. Once the alarm is triggered, sirens will call for reinforcements. Alarms can be disabled and booby trapped as well, so that's fun.

Zip lines to travel across larger distances relatively fast. I suppose they're handy but I'm not sure if they really add anything. 

A crowbar and bolt cutters are new tools. They can be used to open doors and supply crates, some can be opened by picking the lock or brute force, others only by brute force. You can also use them to cut holes in fences or sabotage mission objectives. 

The Kill List is a nice addition. Every mission has an optional objective to kill the target in a specific way. Some are easy, others are a bit trickier but they were fun to do and I'm sure I'll have fun with them in the next few playthroughs. 

I do have some issues with the game, though. Nothing that made me regret buying this game but I still want to mention them.

First of all, it is set in France. Not one French person to be shot, though. Not even civilians. In Italy we got to shoot Italians on both sides but in France the best we get are NPCs slipping in and out of their stupid French accents. Very disappointing.

The graphics are really nice, the fabric of Karl's sweater looks pretty realistic but at the same time the player models look a bit more plasticky. The facial animations are more detailed but look off, especially in the cut scenes. Corpses often have wide open, contorted mouths [strike] and for some reason a lot of them also end up sticking their asses in the air as if to say ""Fick mich hart, Karl, du heißer Scharfschütze"" [/strike] which is more comical than anything else.

I always found the Zombie Army games to a bit a jankier than the Sniper Elite games when it comes to the controls in general. Weapon handling was the most noticeable difference to me and  Sniper Elite 5 feels more in line with Zombie Army 4 than Sniper Elite 4.

Gun handling feels different, more Zombie Army than Sniper Elite but I can't quite explain what that means. The balancing of weapons and other decisions don't make sense to me. They added the Drilling shotgun but it doesn't have a rifle barrel, which is the defining feature of the Drilling. Also, Mosin, poor thing. 

Maps are big just like in SE4 but feel emptier, first few maps have a lot of open fields and hedges. Villages and military structures are smaller. Feels a bit more open world compared to SE4, if that makes sense. Maybe it's the difference in design, I think SE4 had better level design with elevation differences and pathing. Traversing the terrain in 5 is a lot jankier. Lots of invisible walls, hills you can't climb, obstacles you can't mount or vault.

Getting interaction prompts to appear can be a pain. Especially picking up items from safes was quite iffy. I point directly at the documents but no prompt, have to do a little dance to get the prompt and then I still have to pick up the TNT or ammo or whatever before the documents even register. Don't know why that is but it is annoying. 

Enemies are spread thin,  I first thought that was due to Normal difficulty but apparently it's no different on higher difficulties. Will find out for myself soon enough.

Not a big fan of locating work benches to unlock weapon upgrades. I suppose it's nice to change or upgrade your rifle on the go but adding three, one for pistol, SMG and rifle each is a bit much. I very much would have prefered individual weapon challenges like in SE4 to upgrade instead of unlocking them across the board.

And last, but not least, there sadly is no Overwatch mode. I'm sure Invasion can be fun but Overwatch was really good in SE4. A huge improvement on SE3 and I would've loved some DLC missions for Overwatch. 
I prefer co-op, don't really touch multiplayer so the removal of co-op Overwatch means a game with less content.",1679948561,1679948561,True,6,0,0.60964512825012207,0,True,False,False

I bought the base game but a lot of people spent $100 to get the season pass version.  Then they came out w/ a season pass 2.  That made their customers angry.

Lot's of scummy DLC and other sleazy attempts at revenue boosts.

In the campaign, face shots with your pistol doesn't kill the enemy.

When you choose to replay a mission you keep your rank, skills, weapons + customisation and items. You find or unlock items, weapons and ammo types with each mission, and can change or customise your load out at the start of each mission or at workbenches during game play. An item wheel allows for a quick change of ammo type, weapon or item -choose the most effective gear on the fly. Difficulty level ranges from very easy to masochistic, so pick your poison! Replay has the same mission objectives each time but as the environment isn't linear, you can find different approaches and also change your weapons and play style: stealth / assault / non-lethal. 
   Unlike some similar games, you can F5 quicksave and F9 quickload as well as create save games which I really like. The environment is cinematic, voice acting perfect, weapon handling realistic. Detonations are particularly satisfying. Just aim armour piercing ammo at conveniently highlighted weak / flammable spots and kerboooom. Get yourself a Panzerfaust and watch those tanks explode. Or sneak through long grass whilst the infantry yak in German either about their personal lives or even better about what the bosses are up to. Maps are well drawn with objectives clearly marked. Tutorial hints are really useful when you're learning the mechanics and you can turn them off in options when you've got the hang of them.
   All in all, a very satisfying experience.

Yup, this should have been made impossible.6 Anti cheat works for a lot perhaps, but not for play station 5 - opponents literally are at any location at once and always know where you are.7 There are too many bugs, including being kicked out by the server, changing to a riffle after placing a mine and not getting your riffle, gun of machine gun back (takes some effort and does not always succeed at expense of being defenceless).8 Using a knife is still too dominant: shooting in defence of a knife attack does absolutely nothing to the opponent, even if you stand at a ready and the opponent is still meters away (this should have been addressed even in SE4 already).9 Clearance while shooting is so marginal that you can't see the enemy at all, but you still will get shot - only a growing circle symbol gives the enemy away.10 Assigned mouse key suddenly does not work, needs a restart to work again.11 When the host of a mulitplayer game stops mid game, your points will be lost.12 Lying still on a slope makes lying still a joke.

Cost me a few nice shots.18 Multiplayer: for 20 players, the maps are somewhat cramped. One is almost forced to spawnkill players.19 Playing sniper in stead of Counter Strike or Day of Defeat is NOT rewarded really.Online (multiplayer) game play is nice if teams are balanced. However, Rebellion has programmed a system where you can gain levels up to 50. Once reached, you can start again, gaining better level up attributes - this you can do 4 more tier levels up. Keeps you busy, but screws up game play between tier level 0 and say tier level 2, 3 or 4 players. It takes away the fun in this game. Find yourself in one of these games, better to leave and find a better balanced set of teams.Rebellion still puts a lot of effort in nice and large maps.But Rebellion MISSES OUT on several very important aspects in game play, stuff that should and could have been sorted out by now.

Steam says I have played 30 hours. But it does not count first two or three missions, because I started playing them while in Microsoft Game Pass, that is add about 10 hours more. And that'll be time required to play the base game from start through the end (9 missions, actually 9th is very short), while in general one mission took me 4-5 hours o complete. Yes, I know, it is long time, but I like to explore everything and find what is there to find.
So what's new since Sniper Elite 4?

Workbenches in every map (3 per map), where you can unlock/modify your weapons while in mission.

Various weapons (usually slightly better in first missions) lying around to pick up and use while they has ammo. That is modified general weapons you can unlock by progressing thtough the game - silenced versions, stronger versions or with larger magazines etc. Plus there are weapons falling from every dead enemy, you can pick these weapons and use while they has ammo, or simply take ammo from them (need to unlock certain skill for that).

""Parkour"". Yes, some climbing elements from Tomb Raider - ledges, ladders, vines, sliding down the slopes, ziplines. Interesting, useful.

I'm not sure if it is new since 4th game, but there are crowbars and bolt cutters in every map as well as locked doors, crates, walled with planks holes that needs these tools to open new paths.

Also the game still has safes with secret materials or secondary objectives. Safes can be opened with found keys or explosives.

As 4th game it has beautiful graphics and sound, retain hiding in tall grass, sound mask options where player can create them by himself where applicable or use those in the world (fight sounds, plane sounds etc)

One little personal disappointment I have to notice. Even with most difficult custom setting set to lowest amount of ammo found/dropped, there are still plenty of ammo to use. One minor bug I found where killed vehicles retained working engine sounds. And that is it from negative things.

In summary, if you liked 4th game, you'll also like the 5th one. Plus there are additional DLC missions, weapons and skins to unlock.

Oh, and now you can slow down or fast forward the flying bullet scene, I think it is also new feature.

A strange downgrade with this installment compared to the rest of the franchise. But definitely try out Sniper Elite 4 if you're looking to play a smoother, less janky and well paced version of this game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to Sniper Elite 4, this game doesn't play well at all. I don't know what happened, but this feels like a downgrade to the franchise. It's hard to explain, but there were a lot of little things about the game that killed my experience playing it. Player movement was janky at times, and often wouldn't allow you to perform the action you wanted. Stealth could be ruined because of a glitched texture or object you thought you were safely hidden behind. And sometimes the enemies would just.. break ...and not move anymore, especially when you raised suspicion. 

These sorts of things were very smooth and well executed in SE4 but for some reason it's terrible in this game and it really killed my enjoyment of it. Things felt less intuitive and more forced and there were times where I thought I could get creative in my approach, but the game basically said I couldn't for no real reason. 

On top of that there were new mechanics implemented that felt unnecessary. Gun customizations instead of simple upgrades, non-lethal options for bullets and explosives that do nothing for overall gameplay or story, and character upgrades that didn't really change much in how you performed, and were too easy to level up.

The story was also all over the place. Without giving away too much, the game starts with you stuck behind enemy lines for the longest time, all by yourself aside from a few french revolutionists. And all of a sudden, after 3 or 4 of the levels going like that, you're then back with the allies invading Normandy?? There was no real flow to it after that because it felt like we skipped 3 or 4 chapters in a book. In the past, Sniper Elite games have had stories but it never really focused on them aside from providing backstory to the mission you were doing  and setting up the big bosses and their evil scheme that was supposed to turn the tide of war for Germany. It never needed to go further than that, but for some reason it's starting to and it's almost to Sniper Elite's detriment.

Overall while I really wanted to like this game, it just has too many issues for it to be worthwhile. It really felt like I was forcing myself to finish the game towards the end because I was fed up with it. If you've read this far, GO PLAY SNIPER ELITE 4!! I promise you that game is much more polished and very satisfying to play. I hope that future installments of Sniper Elite really try and smooth over these issues.

Somehow feels worse than Sniper Elite 4, and the maps are way less sandboxy. This feels more like an action game than a proper ""sniper experience"", but it's still not bad. And the invasions are great. You don't lose progress or have your game completely messed up like you would in Dark Souls. I also appreciate that they put map markers in for quests even on Authentic mode. I played SE4 brand new and went straight into Authentic mode, which I felt was a fair challenge, but I ended up having to look up maps on the wiki to figure out where the objectives actually wanted me to go. Not so in SE5, big improvement over SE4. Definitely worth the sale price ($25).",1679185375,1679185375,True,1,0,0.490885347127914429,0,True,False,False

If the Core Game was $29.99 and ""Season pass"" was $9.99 I could recommend this.

We now live in a time where ""Games as Services"" are all to common. The core game is lacking in mission quality compare to any of the games that have come to this series before.

It was ~ 50/60 USD at the time I purchased it, for Standard Edition. I bought Deluxe.

The game consisted of 10 missions (incl. hitler's villa if you bought early).
+ multiplayer.
They had all the assets done, engine done, audio done.

Now they are adding ""season passes"":
SP 1 - 2 missions for 30USD
SP 2 - 2 missions for 30 USD

This is a JOKE. Bad one. I do not mind paying for my games, I own over 350 games on Steam + over 200 games on other platforms. All bought. But I do hate such cash grabs.

Initial review:

There are issues with movement, some invisible walls. Sometimes you can't get on a rock. Sometimes your scope range settings resets but it stills shows previous distance... some enemies are stupid as hell, sometimes investigation mode pops out just out of nothing even though there's just no reason for it...
But it's awesome game. Maps are good. I really enjoy stealth & snipe action.
Level design however was great, but .... first mission I felt like I should/could go everywhere and look for clues. Open field map with several buildings and you could guess that every building might have ""intel"" or ""workbench"" or some other collectible. It was easy to find them all. Next levels are flooded with buildings, many of them being empty. Finding all collectibles when playing pure stealth - is just impossible because you would have to check every building and corner. Some workbenches are in same building as you can enter, but cannot get to them the normal way and you need to search for every climbing area outside of building just to explore and get to them. I find it hilarious and it broke some of my fun. Had to use web guides just not to waste 4 hours stealth crawling through the map to collect everything important. Other  than that the gameplay is awesome.",1654003140,1678451948,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are good, the story is OK, i think the customization of load-outs and weapons is a great choice for the direction of the games future. Overall the game is good.

    Having said that, the overall business model for these AAA titles must change or risk losing their perspective fans. MASSIVE patches and updates just to load in some new shirts and ""A"" weapon skin ""hearts and lips"" valentine skin for your m1911 really ... Only to have the next release of,  what i would call worth while content, to of course be behind a pay wall of season 2.  An unnecessary expense when you can pack all of these into an expansion bundle vastly extending game play and RE-play ability. Unfortunately i will no longer be purchasing further season passes or DLC until massive discounts are applied for reasonable amount of content per expansion/ season.

Honestly, none of them are worth it.
No game company out there, past or present, tests their product before release.  Even small bugs can be infuriating! How the crap can a business incur charges upon the customer base, without making sure said product is free from problems?

I originally came into the series at SE3 and I liked it. SE4 came out and my mind was blown with all the features that were added, improvements in graphics etc. The two things that really did it for me in SE4 though were the level design and controls. The game was just a joy to play- you could get maybe 5-6 playthroughs of the same level and still find a completely different way to beat it every time. Also, the fact that the E key was a wildcard that could do everything was a really small change but made it damn near impossible to play any other game that didn't have the option to bind the same key to multiple actions, because I just got so much utility out of it. 

Neither of the two things that made SE4 stand out to me are present in this game. The level design is lazy at best but just infuriating most of the time because of one design decision: INVISIBLE WALLS. God, how I hate invisible walls. They. are. everywhere. Additionally, there are a lot of surfaces and (real) walls/ledges/fences that Karl just can't traverse or jump over despite being like 3ft high or very clearly accessible. You can really tell that the devs are forcing you onto a very linear and pre-planned path in every level. SE4 didn't do that, it gave you an environment not a path, and there was just a certain magic to that which doesn't really exist here. Also another thing that SE4 did fantastically was the cover system, the fact that my visibility to the enemy would change depending on a wide variety of environmental factors like lighting, bush/shrub presence, and distance from the enemy gave the game so much depth - it really made you feel like you were a commando officer sneaking around enemy lines. As you can presume this is completely non-existent in SE5. The enemies spot you from a mile away even if you're in a dark, well-hidden area, which takes away the tactical planning you would do everytime you enter a new area. If the enemy will spot you one way or another, why care about stealth... In a stealth game?

Also can we talk about the DLC for a second? Because good lord does it suck so far. I was never a fan of the weapons packs in any of the games, but at least there was always this element of realism before (even realism-adjacency I'd be fine with). But bright-pink colored guns with hearts on them for a ""Valentines pack""? Seriously? This isn't Fortnite. Also for some reason the updates that drop with each of these new packs are always 50-100GB downloads, but there is never a changelog indicating that new features have been added...

What really adds insult to injury here is that there are shimmers of a better game beneath all the gunk. Small individual features like the improved environment sensing & minimap, the weapon upgrades, and the lethality system would have stood out so much better if they weren't tainted by the broader fact that SE5 abandoned a lot of things that made this series great.

I'll stay hopeful that the devs take the community's grievances on board and try to at least recapture the essence of the 4th game. But I'm not optimistic...",1677979818,1677980052,False,3,1,0.524793386459350586,0,True,False,False

The replay value of this game is pretty high as it is pretty challenging to find all the hidden items and hidden kill objectives on the first playthrough without looking at a guide.

One downside, if you like to sneak around the map, there's not a lot of opportunities for sniping. Sniping in close range alerts enemies quite easily even with suppressors. When playing a stealth playthrough I mainly find myself using a suppressed pistol and going in for melee kills.

It's a [u][b]Meh[/b][/u] from me. SE5 doesn't give me the vibe like SE3 or SE4 did. Can't say I hate the game, but I don't take a liking to it, either.

The multiplayer modes (campaign co-op, survival and PVP) are almost dead now. The best case scenario I've ever seen was having 3 available lobbies of Survival Mode displayed on the server list. However, I was only able to join one of them. An error code [i]12011[/i] was given upon disconnecting from the other two, but I couldn't find any thread or FAQ explaining what this error code meant on the Internet.

I tried one of the maps of Survival mode, and that map was not fun at all. Too much fight in back alleys and on the streets, and your bolt-actions have little use here. 

""Invisible wall"" is really an existing problem. Imagine a top-notch Ally sniper, going on a secret mission of sabotaging Axis's evil plans and assassinating the Führer, was UNABLE to traverse 10 square feet (1 square meter) of thigh-tall bushes which were sparser than the [spoiler]secret-spot hair of your average Russian triple-X stars.[/spoiler] 

Gun customization is somewhat useless and somewhat laughable. Non-lethal rounds on sniper rifles? Against the Axis? Seriously? And changing materials of your gun stocks is even funnier than all that. [spoiler]""Sorry bro, but we don't have that kind of trees around here. If you want to change your rifle stock from white birch to black walnut you will have to wait for the next supply shipment. Oh and BTW, that shipment has long gone due to recent U-boat attacks.""[/spoiler] 

Compared with SE3 and SE4, SE5 is not an outstanding installment, nor an unforgettable finale of the series.

Some of the issues:

* Invasion mechanic, on what planet do you enable it by default and penalize the player for turning it off (less XP).
* Kill shots look worse than in 4.
* Tagging is horrible.
* Removal of s-mines and trip mines.
* Emphasis on ""realism"", e.g. tanks are harder to destroy, no more infinite stones, but still implement a non-lethal side. 
* I don't get the non-lethal combat, nobody ever got a medal for not killing the enemy during a war.
* Weird focus system (not really realism, if you ask me).
* Subsonic bullets are a joke.
* Some of the bugs:
  * Enemy bodies disappearing
  * It's not an open world, I've been stuck behind bushes/walls that my 5 year old nephew could vault.

However, it does have its flaws.  Despite being released as a sniping game, it is fairly easy to complete each mission with an assault style playthrough, utilizing unscoped rifles and the various secondary weapons.  If its a more realistic take you desire, a pure stealth sniping route could easily land you 60+ hours of gameplay, and it is worth just about every hour.  Observing patrol routes, calculating the trajectories, pacifying or killing lone sentries, every action demands your utmost attention and ability to plan out the next move.  For example, it takes me about 6 to 7 hours of gameplay just to complete each mission undetected.  The option for just simple run-and-gun DOOM style fighting can also work if that's more your speed.

Moving on from basic gameplay, the visuals are stunning, the levels are large and feature various zones to either blitz or sneak through, and the ability to pick up weapons from fallen enemies and supply crates is a plus, in my mind.  Each level has a hidden cache with at least one MG42 and a belt of 100 rounds to neutralize large groups of soldiers, while Panzerfausts and Panzerbusche anti-tank rifles can deliver stand-off attacks on armored vehicles and troop transports.  Every encounter can be dealt with in a variety of ways, and while that's not a new feature in the series, it's the best implementation of it so far.

The AI can be rather smart at times, but is still rather easy to fool.  Soldiers will take cover when shot at, and if you're using a suppressor on your rifle, this can lead to them actually retreating and falling farther and farther back, but this only works if you are outside of their detection range, which is another very well-implemented gameplay mechanic.  I've played way too many games that feature the Hollywood-esque suppressor where your weapon is silent at all ranges.  The suppressors in this game though work exactly as they should, and while they significantly reduce the range at which your shots can be heard, they don't completely remove them either.

The various types of ammunition you can unlock during the game is another great feature, although the less said about the nonlethal rounds, the better.  Subsonic ammunition though is a game changer, and combine that with a customised Welrod, and you can complete missions with just that sidearm.  And speaking of unlocks, it just feels reminiscent of Call of Duty and Battlefield, where you have to meet the prerequisites to obtain them, from attachments to weapons and gear.  I did enjoy having to find the workbenches to mount the new attachments or utilize the new kit, but it does get a bit ridiculous.  Have you seen a Tarkov-inspired Luger?  Some of the attachments just don't work like that at all.

Moving on to weapons, the selection was pretty decent, but I wish there was more!  The SREM-1 is a nifty little rifle that I actually did not know anything about.  I'd never even heard of it, and thought Rebellion was pulling my leg, until I watched Saint Jonathon at the Royal Armouries actually talk about it and show off the only surviving example.  Speaking of which, Rebellion, would you please complete it's model, it's missing a scope ring, and the point where that can be attached is easily seen on the handguard.  Moving on from that, for a game based in France, there's not a lot of French weapons available.  I was expecting to see a Lebel or a Berthier, maybe even a MAS-36, but maybe that's for a later DLC package, I'm not sure.  I wasn't expecting to see Japanese weapons and equipment, so that was a little weird despite being central to the campaign.

And that leads to a new issue, the campaign is basically the same: the Nazis have a new superweapon, you have to follow all the leads to find said superweapon, then you blow it up and kill the man in charge.  That was V2 with a V2 rocket loaded with Tabun gas, that was 3 with the P.1000 Ratte superheavy tank, that was 4 with an upgraded radio-guided rocket, and now we have stealth-plated submarines with V2 rockets.  The formula is getting tired at this point.  Same for the Hitler assassination missions.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with killing Hitler.  It's just, when are we going to be able to target other senior Nazi officials?  I've shot Hitler's testicle off in four separate games now.  I no longer have that juvenile chuckle.

And now we get to the major issue I've been having.  Sniper Elite 5 is still acting like its out of Alpha and into Beta.  I'm having game-crashing bugs practically every level, more often 2 to 3 times per level.  I don't know if that's because the code is still a little iffy or if it's because my hard drive isn't capable of running it, all I do know is that this issue still needs worked on.  If you've read this far, good for you, make sure your PC is up to the minimum requirements, but I highly recommend going as far beyond that as you financially can.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't have the money to throw at it right now.  I will say that it is very frustrating having to restart my PC multiple times just to finish a single mission.

Well, that's all I've got.  Make sure you get your free DLC downloads when they come out, because hey, they're free even if they don't do much of anything gameplay wise.  I can't say much for the rest of the DLC, I don't have them yet.  Sniper Elite 5 is another solid addition to the franchise, but what's next?  We've gone to Berlin, to North Africa, to Italy, and now France.  There's only so much more Karl Fairburne can do before V2 begins, so will we see him again in the Netherlands as part of Market Garden, or maybe in Belgium for the Battle of the Bulge?  All I know is, his story is almost done, if not done already.  That's up to Rebellion, but I think they might still have one more installment before calling it quits.

This is a good game to play if you've got time to kill, and if you can handle the game-ending bugs and hope they get patched, then this game could be a good entry into your library.  If you want to snipe, look no further.  If you want to run-and-gun, you can do that here.  If you want to be the SOE-equivalent of James Bond, that's here too.  If you have the previous entries, then you know Karl's story so far, but now you have to help him liberate France.  The war is in it's final act, the Western Allies have landed in Normandy, the Soviet Union is moving in from the East, and the Third Reich has less than a year to live.  What insane wonder weapon will they come up next, and who's the next officer to assassinate?  Hopefully, we'll find out next time.  Take care, everybody, and remember: 'Vive la France!'",1676874122,1676874122,True,29,3,0.715241312980651855,0,True,False,False

The Sniper Elite series seems to strive for authenticity. It's hardest mode is called ""Authentic"", and honestly I'll be damned if it's not the most authentic shooter experience in a game I've had; wind/bullet drop, smart AI etc. But there are basic flaws in the game that make the authentic mode inauthentic and a lot harder, it's terribly frustrating to be killed be inauthenticities when that's the whole point.

1. When searching an enemy for loot, lives enemies can come upon you and shoot and it takes way too long for our character to disengage searching and engage in fighting. 
2. Can't shoot all lights out in SE 5. In SE4 not only could you shoot out basically every light to provide cover of darkness, you could through rocks and do it silently. That was SO COOL.
3. Authentic provides no indication of health, but wouldn't we have some idea how close we were to death if we'd been shot? I guess it's all out the window since we can continuously patch ourselves with bandages and med kits but still. 
4. Melee should be instant kill. We are a super elite bad ass, and yet some of these German foot soldiers can block us again and again and again. One soldier I even shot first, then tried to melee, and he was still able to block me indefinitely. C'mon. 

Still love the game. Recommend.

The Great:
Ironsight for every gun.
Now you can pickup non scope sniper rifles.
Every gun has bullet camera.
Difficulty can be adjusted to your own taste.
INVASION! I personally LOVE this and I spent more time playing this instead of the campaign. You can also interrupt the coop session not only SP sessions with invasion and kill the players.

The Good:
Maps are good but not great.
Level design is good. It forces you to explore the entire map.
Weapon modification has been greatly improved.

The Bad:
Very limited opportunities for sound masking. SE2 had a great one for this.
The enemies are getting stuck in the walls sometimes, usual SE bugs...
Every time you quit the game it will crash.
Wind effect doesn't exist compared to previous games. It has been massively tuned down even on hardest settings.
No Russian enemies, I personally enjoyed killing Soviets more than the Nazis in the first two games.

The Ugly:
The story and dialogues as always with SE games... only SE1 had a decent story with dialogues and characters that you actually cared about.
They removed ""Overwatch"" COOP mode and the only available COOP is survival and normal compaign.
The overpriced DLCs for guns.

It's fun.

My suggestion for a fun time is to go to mission 5 and make a save by the flare gun, that way you can mess around with being invaded and trying to kill an invader with the artillary barrage.

Works like 1/10 times but when it does it's freaking funny, also its funny to watch them stand there for a sec then run like a bat out of hell.

Edit: How the frig is the vanishing ammo bug STILL in the game? Do you enjoy having silenced ammo so you can kill stuff without everyone on the map knowing where you are?

Well sorry, I hope you NEVER EVER open the inventory radius as that will vanish away your sniper rifle and pistol silenced ammo, even if you have that ammo already equipped.

Makes it such a PITA when you are on a map with lots of NPC's and get invaded and suddenly you have no silenced ammo.

Also invaders invading and then setting up camp at a phone for 3 mins to find out where you are, wasting your time, obviously you move, they then go to a different phone and do it again and again.

Freaking 19 min 'matches' of you searching for the invader because they are wasting your ******* time to finally find them behind a wall by using your sense ability, FYI just equip armor piercing ammo and shoot them through a wall.

I 100% this game with my best friend Jim since we played sniper 4 and had a blast with it. Playing this game threw with a friend was very fun and a great challenge. We even went the extra mile and got all those extra missions in the game that are not achievement based, but require some good shots or skills to get even more items to use and play in the game. 

Also the PvP achievement are very easy to get and wont take to long to knock out, They just want you to play, and not get crazy amount of wins or kills either. I don't enjoy this game for the pvp but the PvE is great to have.

With that said there is a new mode they added in this that allows random players to invade your single player, or co-op game session and provides a challenge to a normal every day game. With that said it feels like after playing this game on the hardest difficulty first since we had experience from sniper 4, the PvE was SUPER easy even on the hardest difficulty. I feel like they made the NPC worse for the idea that you might be invaded by another player, and even when i played with this off, they are still easy. In sniper 4 I couldn't rambo my way threw a level, i needed to learn, adjust, and get better to win. Where in this one it felt like I could go into a gun fight with 10 people, and get out okay, loot there bodies and get enough healing to counter act all the pain they gave me.

Playing this with my friend it was a blast, although we enjoyed the gameplay style, we both agreed that this PvE was way easier on the hardest mode then Sniper 4 was, and like I aid earlier, I don't play this for PvP at all so look to someone else review for PvP.",1675926983,1675926983,True,2,1,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False

+ Great gear customizability. Plenty of different types of muzzles, suppresors, scopes, receivers, etc. You can tailor your guns to your personal playstyle. For each weapon configuration you're given the exact distance at which the shot will be inaudible (suppressors only make it a little quieter, even on lower difficulties). Suppressors can now be used independently of ammo type, allowing for many different levels of gunshot audibility (most quiet of course being suppressor plus subsonic ammo).

+ Increased ammo variety. Vehicles are now immune to regular ammo, even at weak points. Only armor-piercing bullets can hurt them. Subsonic ammo is quieter but has greater bullet drop. Match ammo has reduced bullet drop but is louder. Soft-point ammo deals more damage to human targets but can't penetrate armor or helmets. Additionally there's non-lethal ammo - quieter and doesn't kill (in case you suddenly feel sorry for those poor low-ranking nazis).

+ Music - somewhat better and more noticable than in SE4, at least in my opinion.

+ NPC dialogue. In SE4 nazis sounded like cartoonish villains. Now they sound more like human beings.

--- PROS/CONS (depending on personal preferences):

+/- In addition to the wind indicator in scoped view which allows for horizontal adjustments, there's now also a similar indicator for gravity. This makes sniping less reliant on luck, but also probably a bit easier. Some people will like it, some won't.

+/- When aiming at an enemy with any weapon, there's now an icon above his head if he's within audible range of your gunshot. Same as with sniping, this makes stealth less reliant on luck, but also easier. Again, a matter of taste.

+/- No more ""authentic plus"" difficulty. ""Authentic"" is now the highest. Hardcore fans and realism nuts will probably be dissapointed.

--- CONS:

- Map design could be slightly better, with more vantage points and sniping opportunities (except ""Spy Academy"" - this one is a masterpiece).

- Fairburne is now wearing some lousy sweater, which makes him look significantly less badass.",1675701893,1675701893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I took a firm stealth approach to the entire game, which worked out very well. If you like that sort of playstyle, you will enjoy this. If analyzing troop movements and finding short strike windows is your thing, this game has it in spades. 

What I liked...

- The weapon customization is detailed enough to be fun, although a few of the items are a little silly. I'm looking at you, weirdly-crossed grip tape.

- The visuals are fantastic.

- Soldier bios - This was a nice touch. It allows you to get to know your quarry before you put a bullet through its skull. Not sure why they added this feature, but it was kind of funny.

- The suppressed rifle sounds actually sound fairly realistic. As someone who spends a good deal of time on the range and spent seven years in the Army, it's nice to hear a game get this right.

What I didn't like...

- I'm not a fan of ""weapon/item unlock"" mechanics in games. I'm not even sure why developers put these in games any more. It would be great if you started with the ability to build your loadout however you wanted. The pros and cons of each weapon/item should be enough on their own to prevent any particular loadout from being overpowered.

- I'm not a fan of the way the player icon displays on the map. I know, it's a small thing, but when you are trying to orient yourself on maps this size, the direction of the character icon should reflect the way the camera is facing instead of the character's body. This is a minor annoyance when you are in cover, which is a lot of the time. 

- Constant kill cams get old. Look, I loved this game. Thought it was great, but if I smoke 150+ dudes on one map, I have to watch 150 kill cams. Each one runs about seven seconds. That's 17+ minutes of kill cams. Bruh, that's a bit much. I know you can turn them off completely, but what about a happy medium or some way to modify the kill cam frequency? This is just one bald dude's opinion.

Overall, this was a great game. Definitely took top spot for me for the SE series of games. I'll be buying the DLC so I can go smoke the dude with the bad haircut and the toothbrush mustache next. Have fun dropping bodies. I certainly did.",1675643222,1675643222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I held off buying SE5 because of negative reviews and the many similar complaints among them. I almost let those negative opinions influence me to pass up this game I am enjoying. Here are some of the common gripes that are just not true......

1) ""Not open world"". ""Game-play is funneled by obstacles"". 
NOT TRUE.  The map can be traversed by many ways just as in SE4. Even with hedgerows that are common to north France, I feel no constriction.
2) ""Few  opportunities for sniper long shots."" ""Penalized for remaining in one place too long."" 
NOT TRUE. I find many vantage points where I remain undetected that afford plenty of opportunity for those satisfying long shots. But if I remain concealed in place too long near the enemy the AI has increasing chance to spot me. 
3) ""Feels less like a sniper game and more like a special ops stealth game"" and ""Stealth is not done well.""
NOT TRUE. SE5 offers both and does both very well. And when time comes to run and gun well placed grenades and sub-machine gun spray provide very exciting game play.

Single player.....
Much is said about multi-play and Invasion mode but I play only single-play. Invasion mode can be toggled off. Solo play through the campaign is very enjoyable.

Replay value....
Campaign maps provide many ways to complete and the enemy AI will challenge in diverse ways resulting in unique play every time. 

I could go on. But you the reader have also seen the objections that have you hesitant like I was to try SE5. So I write this positive review with hope my words will help you decide to give SE5 a try. Be aware of the time spent playing as you test the game for yourself. Do not go over the two hour refund mark. If you do not like SE5 then just refund it.

It's been a second game from this series for me, and in my opinion the best of all by far.

[u] Personal thoughts: [/u]

What made me to feel good in this, is that Sniper Elite finally came to France, 1944. That is what I like about it. That is a proof you can make WW2 game still with very modern and solid gameplay, that won't be totally generic.
Surprisingly D-Day doesn't felt like before in this title.  It used to have in call of duty series but, here, SE 5 is one and only a non-multiplayer game like (Post-Scriptum, HLL) that allows you to explore open maps based on Normandy locations. Still having their own and new flavour.
And some maps are enough big to let you enjoy the Normandy from open perspective. What is enjoying too, the number of WW2 guns and their customization is beyond satisfying, and it isnt over-looked nor overdone. If you're a WW2 enthusiasts you can love this series, I'm glad the Normandy came to this series with fresh look. Possibly next game will head towards the Pacific as some hints can be found in the game or into the Ardennes, Belgium, but we will see...

[u] What game offers? [/u]

- large maps and long missions 
- good and fresh looking Normandy and D-Day setting
- replayability e.g. exploring map=unlocking new start locations ,or unlocking new objectives
- use of different paths and fight methods
- good gun customization
- plenty of weapons and attachments to use (smgs, assault rifles, sniper rifles)
- invasion mode in campaign - the enemy player, playing as Wehrmacht's sniper tries to eliminate and stop you, or you can play to stop someone's missions
- multiplayer - with no run'gun cod like, just sniping , no crossing to run, very nice like in Ghost Warrior Games.

[u] What it doesn't offer? [/u]

- not all maps are that super big, half of them is in standard size
- only a couple missions where u play with other squad members or protect squads 
- still lone wolf game, doesn't involve you in that 'large' battle feeling

[u] Issues? [/u]

Game is very well optimized. As the minimum requirements are presented, you can still have 3gb or even less of VRAM, to enjoy the game. Tested on Gtx 750 ti, gtx 760 and finally on 1050ti. Graphics are really nice. Sometimes but much rarely, u can spot dead bodies to glitch in textures and not properly collide with some terrain objects. Not too often.
Sniper Elite 5 is really great game from the series. Though I spent good hours in this game, I feel it should have more missions as there are 8 (basic edition)- however pretty long to complete them 100%.

[u] Any improvements? [/u] 

- new possibilities of enemies AI, they aren't that stupid like before in SE Afrika (what I have heard before) or  you have to respect enemies in open engagement even on easy difficulty and plan your tactic.
- new movement and shot animations, 
- new audio effects: gun shots are extremely good, it's well made that silenced rifles are still loud, which is correct in real life.
- longer missions and more items to use, as well plenty explore and to find in loot.

[u] Conclusion: [/u]

Though I spent good hours in this game, I feel it should have more missions as there are 8- however very long to complete, and each location looks completely different. Apparently SE5 is the best from the series, still it is being updated with new content. The best game to grab from the series. If they make next part in the Pacific Theater it would be total epicness.

There is a focus on stealth-action/espionage gameplay, but unfortunately the actual stealth isn't as good as either of those games. 

Instead there are sniping elements like bullet drop, wind speed, and 'sound masking', with a bit of a focus on things like managing your heart rate - e.g if you sprint for a while, your increased heart rate will make your sniper scope unsteady until you catch your breath, and if you are bleeding from a wound then your heart rate will not decrease until you use a bandage or medkit. 

You can also customise elements of difficulty like turning the minimap, and enemy marking on or off. After going through the game once I found going through a second time without a map or markers was an excellent challenge, because you really need to make some of those shots count.

Be aware that the game is a bit janky. There are invisible walls around the edges of missions, and there is no jump button, so sometimes you can't climb over really simple barriers like chest high walls or small rocky slopes (instead you get a button prompt to climb things like walls and fences if it is possible). It makes just a couple of parts of the game seem weird and confusing. But when it is good, it is REALLY good and you can have some seriously fun and very tense moments moving through very detailed European castles and cities. Trying to do a no kill run can be very difficult.

The most fun comes from the co-op and invasion modes, which add extra layers to the experience and allow you to come back and approach missions in entirely new ways. Invasions especially require players to keep moving and always be alert to their surroundings. 

At the time of writing there is one frustrating issue where the player character will narrate information to himself out loud for the benefit of the player (e.g ""I see the enemy bunker up ahead, looks like the intel was correct."") and the invading player can hear him speaking to himself. The defending player cannot currently turn these narrations or control their speaking volume when being invaded, which means they might unintentionally give themselves away just by walking into a new area. With enough feedback the developers should be able to patch something like this. EDIT: they fixed this issue.",1653898951,1674973600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first time I tried to run the game it changed my system resolution to 400p and I couldn't change it back without resetting my computer.  Otherwise I want to like the game because I liked the one before; however, there's a lot of invisible walls.  You can only interact with some objects, so there'll be a ledge that's knee height and you can't step over it.  You're forced to find an acceptable path.  In the same vein you can't sneak under or around certain objects where there is plenty of space to be able to.  Basically there are a lot of invisible walls.  More importantly the game crashes a lot.  I would probably get through the game, but how many times am I willing to restart it?

I liked the maps and they did feel open world to me, nonetheless what other people said. Sure, there are some choke points, like doors in a wall you need to get to the other side of, but that's no biggie for me.

But. what is it you expect from a sniper game? Long distance, try to not be noticed? Somehow that game didn't get the memo.
I mean sure, in each chapter you get to do some nice long distance shots, but often you need to get closer, like 50-100 meters. Still distance, sure, but then the other problem comes in, stealth.
You only get proper silencers quite far in and even they are just ""noticeable up to 50-80 meters"" and often you're forced to get closer. You can use sub-sonic ammo to reduce it quite a bit but somehow the game designers decided that you can only unlock those for the loadout halfway through the game and then get like 15 shots or so and you can nearly never find them in the levels after mission 2. You find loads of non-lethal wooden ammo tho (everyone knows a pointy block of wood hitting you at supersonic speeds just knock you out).
I remember in mission 3, where you assault a castle. Was quite a way away from it, but had no silencers yet, only basic bitch sniper rifle (not that the later ones were all that great) and no subsonic. One shot. And the whole freaking map searched for me. Dudes from a bridge far away searched for me.

So most of the game you either don't bother with stealth at all, go into hiding after every shot until the enemies search no more or actually just go up close with takedowns and the pistol that is properly silenced.
A sniper game where going for melee is the better option. Figure.

There were a list of other annoyances. Like kill someone from a distance that carries a letter. Continue sneakily cleaning up the location, save frequently. Screw up, reload. Finish. Go to the body with the letter to pick it up and whoops, it never loaded in when you reloaded, kiss that letter goodbye.
Or tanks, even smallish ones. Tanks are tanks, sure, but why would you need several bazookas, several blocks of TNT or a satchel charge and one or two packs of TNT? Just make them indestructible if you really don't want the player to kill one.
Also Karl, we're 8 missions in. I think I know by now that I can hide in tall grass without you repeating it every time I touch some.

The mechanics itself is not that different, however it is polished even more with the variety of weapon customization and enemies. There are multiple ways to complete your quests.

However I think the same like the 4 one, it is very mind consuming in a sense that you will spend a lot of time just docking and shooting, and trying to sneak again, and shoot again.

The fifth installment does not disappoint. The same ""basic"" storyline, the same ""generic"" baddies and NPCs, ""adjusted for inflation"" graphics and the ""tried and tested"" gameplay. Nothing to surprise, nothing to disappoint.

I did however face a slurry of nasty bugs. From the trigger of my sniper stopping to work till I save and reload, or interaction points not ""interacting"", and enemies moonwalking stuck between a backyard garden and fence. It took me out of the immersion but thankfully, I did not have to restart a mission so all good.

I really enjoy this game, idk what everyone hates it for. Got it on Christmas sale around £25, thought it was a great instalment to follow Italia. The level design is good, I loved how most levels had fun heavy weapons like MG42s and Panzerfausts everywhere if you look close enough.
The weapon customisation system is great, I saw some criticism of it but it's really extensive and there are quite a few ways to build an inventory, rather than token visual effects. All the enemies scale with how far you get into a campaign, the jaegers were genuinely potent in firefights instead of glorified rifle fodder.

The best sniping maps are after the 4th map in my opinion, and if you can get through the first 4, the game really starts to shine. The exceptions are the second map, Occupied Residence, and the third map, Spy Academy, which were interesting and had a fun mix of gameplay styles, Spy Academy in particular. 

A tip is to do a bit of scouting before entering areas and immediately starting to stealth kill enemies. A lot of the time you'll kill everyone and miss a good sniping spot where you could have nested yourself and taken them on from there, creating a sound mask by sabotaging a nearby generator. 

Another tip is to put FSR onto Ultra (if you can) and turn off anti-aliasing. The game is quite jaggy and has quite a bit of shimmering, particularly in the foliage, and FSR smooths it out while looking a lot like your native res. Turning anti-aliasing off makes the image sharper while in FSR Ultra mode, so in the end you end up getting a free 10-20fps while making the game look better (I play in 1080p by the way). Play the game on high settings instead of Ultra as well.

1) Nice extension of the storyline from Sniper Elite 4; writers are to be commended.
 
2) Graphics and takedown animations are FANTASTIC providing player satisfaction in taking out enemies and seeing GORGEOUS architecture (makes me want to travel to Europe!).

3) The game mechanics are familiar from previous editions; players pick up right where they left off.

4) Lighting/Shadowing very realistic if you set-up as intended; (snipers not easily localized at first).

5) Storyline very well-developed; kudos to developers for making campaign mode educational with real history references (HINT: Make games super-historically accurate and then schools can promote their use in the classroom --bigger bottom line for the developers while educating the masses!).

CONS:
1) Main character should be able to jump/climb up, over, down anything in the game; give character ability to cur wires fences or barbed wire with bolt/wire cutters - CURRENTLY UNABLE

2) Main character should be able to start with items accrued from last mission- CURRENTLY UNABLE

3) Main character should be able to access weapon mods of previous missions at workbenches in subsequent missions - CURRENTLY UNABLE

4) MORE points given for knocking unconscious or NOT killing enemies (incapacitation) is lame - DEVELOPERS OBVIOUSLY FEEL SORRY FOR NAZIS AND WANT YOU NOT TO KILL THEM, JUST INCAPACITATE.

5) ""Mission Boundary"" indicators are lame; this is where Snipers Eiite needs to become more open-world. Make it so that there are like things in the way (rubbish, debris, walls, crashed vehicles, etc.) that prevents character from going there rather than basically telling player 'uh sorry, you are at our game limits."" 

Suggestions for improvement:
1) Allow players to access their inventory in something other than just the utility wheel to show what has been picked up and what still can sought out. Having menus in different places (wheel/TAB menu/etc.) seems over-burdensome [copyright issues with other titles?]


2) Let player be able to climb over anything you could reasonably climb over or crawl under anything you could reasonably crawl under.  I mean who has not seen old WWII movies where the OSS is hiding under the train car or vehicle and then grabs the feet of the passing sentry to take them down????

3) In terms of freedom of character movement,,...and sorry for this reference, but think Ghost Recon / Division style movement - not necessarily parkour, but at least be able to jump up on a roof to take a long shot across a field at a target.

4) Cinematic animations should reflect correct gender/character used in mission; seems default is to use Karl Fairburne all the time; please fix; not a gameplay issue, more so a polishing issue.

5) Go open world, if you can, in Sniper Elite 6 and beyond.

BOTTOM LINE: Would I buy the game again knowing what I know after 5 missions? Absolutely, YES. 
(I understand this is not a AAA title, but the developers obviously worked their butts off to give us players an enjoyable experience with the budget they had; KUDOS!)

-Beautiful maps and environments
-In-depth gun customization


Cons:
-Enemy AI will sometimes be permanently stuck in the ""Searching"" status, leading to autosaves being disabled for 15+ minutes at a time
-Enemy AI will sometimes see you through solid walls
-Enemy AI will switch between having no reaction to you whatsoever and immediately gunning you down the moment you're in their sight
-Enemy AI will sometimes break entirely, leading them to climbing ladders, falling down immediately after, and repeating the process until they die from fall damage
-Enemy AI will pinpoint your exact location nearly every time you shoot somebody
-The game, despite having ""Sniper"" in the title, encourages you to and rewards you for using non-lethal options (Leading to the famous Sniper Elite X-ray Cam rarely ever being seen) and also encourages you to use your pistol instead of your sniper due to the aforementioned pinpointing mechanics
-Maps, despite feeling and looking wide-open and large, are incredibly structured and linear once examined while playing
-Kill-List assassinations will hide their optional rewarding objective until you manually open the objectives tab and expand the assassination mission
-The game withholds XP from you for disabling the Axis Invasion setting
-The ending of the story is incredibly anticlimactic and wasn't rewarding in the slightest

* MP maps are too bugged - players guns are visible over the walls, many obstacles are definitely evadable, but you cant go there...

How many N*zis can you kill before it get´s boring? Since this game is a straight up copy - or if you want to be nice - follow up of the earlier Sniper Elites, there is not much new or impressing. Karl is on another killing spree, finding another hidden german ""Top Secret"" project, with many many generic baddies waiting for him to shoot in the especially ridiculous kill cam views. Yadda yadda.

The graphics seem to be worse then in the last part (why?), nearly every customization for weapons and characters is locked behind some mode you have to finish first, after which you are not interested in it anymore anyway. The levels are big, but way too empty and especially in the big old buildings you have too often to search pointless where you should go at all.

Add to that Rebellions general unsympathic Epic exclusive approach and there is not much reason to actually waste your money on this one. At least the zombie variants of this have some nice music, which is also missing here.

Conclusio: Borefest for only the most dedicated N+zi Killers.

[b]Invasion Mode[/b] is well suited for a game like this ([i]invade other player's single player missions, with consent ofc, like in Souls games[/i]).

The UI is looking fresh af, even for us Authentic fans. The maps are gorgeously hand crafted. The scenery flows with a noticeable lack of graphical tiling.

The main thing I would like to see added, is the aggressive AI from SE4's Authentic Plus mode. It's hard to tell how much of that was carried over, now that we have one less Authentic level of difficulty. I just really liked how they would never stop searching for you. They would form search parties and fan out all over the map. The upside to that extra challenge, was that you could lure many more soldiers onto the same set of traps.

I also really enjoyed earning the achievements for beating the Authentic modes in SE4 without saving, or manually saving.

This latest iteration (SE5) introduces some maddening gotchas that make it feel badly-designed and poorly-conceived compared to the earlier iterations. Especially as a AAA game at around $50 USD, it's a rip-off. I got it on a half-price sale and still don't feel like it was worth the cost. If you can pick it up for under $20, you might get your money's worth, but maybe not. It depends upon your willingness to endure the badness. Personally, I find the wonky glitches to be problematical enough that I cannot recommend it.

MANY of the other negative reviews mention my same points, so I would urge you to take the negative reviews seriously! But I'll reiterate just some of the problems for special emphasis.

* Rebellion totally broke body-looting compared to previous iterations! WHY? WHY redesign a system that worked just fine before. In SE5 you have to be perfectly lined-up with a body and looking ""down"" at it to even get the option to ""Search."" That's maddening enough, because it's often ridiculously time-consuming to try to get lined up just right to be able to ""Search."" But....

* MUCH worse is that even when you are lined up just right, you hold ""E"" to ""Search,"" and instead the dumb interface immediately grabs the nearest weapon (that might even be behind you!) that the body dropped onto the ground! I don't WANT that weapon! I did everything possible to NOT pick it up! But, noooo. This dumb game is just determined that if I hit ""E"" (even as a ""hold"" of the key) I MUST want that weapon. It's flat-out ridiculous, and by the time you finish the game, you'll be raging at the number of times you are FORCED to pick up and then drop a weapon you did NOT want to pick up. So, in summary, the looting system is ABSURDLY broken!

* The armored vehicles are stupid-hard to deal with. In previous iterations, you could take them out with Teller mine and/or TNT, which is legit! The 40s-era armor couldn't withstand a Teller/TNT combo, but in SE5 NO amount of explosives can one-shot an armored vehicle. Instead, you must deal explosives damage and then position yourself behind the vehicle and start pumping armor-piercing rounds into the exposed (after the initial explosives) ""weak spots"" until the thing blows up. It's just time-consuming, inaccurate artificial difficulty. Complete waste of time/effort that does the opposite of adding to the ""realism"" of the game.

* This is NOT a ""sniper"" game, like previous iterations were. You are often forced by terrain, buildings, etc. into close-quarters combat. I've actually killed more MOBs with my Welrod than with my sniper rifle.

* A big part of the above (virtually forced) play style is that SE5 utterly nerfed your capacity to CHOOSE to take a silenced shot versus a loud shot. There is NO subsonic ammo for the rifle, as in ALL other iterations of this franchise! You have to choose a silenced WEAPON, but even then the sonic reduction is at most about 30%, which doesn't really affect your strategic decisions. Again, WHY? WHY break/remove one of the key features that made the franchise great? So, Rebellion has decided that if you want to go silenced, you'll use the Welrod, because (did I mention?) the silenced rifles (that I've seen) DON'T HAVE A SCOPE! Whaaatttt?!? Yes, you read that right: If you pick up or chose a silenced rifle, you get no scope! Is this a bug? It can't be a design-decision, because that would be insane! But, yes, you cannot switch between a silenced shot and a loud shot at will in the game. Ridiculous! For me, this was almost a deal-breaker.

I could go on and on and on and on. READ the other negative reviews, and BELIEVE them! But I'll mention one important point that I haven't seen mentioned in the other reviews: This game is WOKE! And it's relentlessly so.

Throughout the game, you are surrounded in enemy dialog, and it's all WOKE. You get tortured language like, ""Find the sniper and kill them!"" Or, ""Sniper, we're gonna find you. Troops, find them. They have to be around here somewhere."" And it goes on and on. It's stupid and tortured to refer to a person in the singular and then the plural! Yeah, yeah, I hear in some quarters today that ""they"" and ""them"" are now also singular terms. NO THEY ARE NOT! They are not CORRECTLY singular terms, and I REFUSE to destroy language itself to serve a woke agenda! So, now this has to be crammed down my throat in a GAME! Seriously!

Even worse is that this game is set in the mid 1940s, NOT 2022! Moreover, Karl is an obviously manly-man who would NEVER identify as ""non-binary"" or some such confusion! YOU play AS Karl, and if you don't want to ""identify"" AS KARL, then go play some other game. In THIS game, there is ZERO doubt that Karl is a MAN, so there is ZERO doubt that HIS preferred pronouns (what a made-up term in its own right) would be HE and HIM! So, the German soldiers of the 40s would be saying, ""Find the sniper and kill him!"" NOTHING else!!! And if the game is determined to avoid ""offensive pronouns,"" then don't use pronouns! Say things like, ""Find the sniper! KILL the sniper!"" Simple. But no. Rebellion is making a point here.

Moreover, regardless of how KARL would ""identify,"" there is ZERO chance that German soldiers of the 40s would be using WOKE language! Period! So now we have a game that is literally going to PRETEND that 40s-era German soldiers would be talking like modern snowflakes? Absolutely NOT. QUIT projecting your wokeness back into history. This is a VERY recent dysphoria, and it IS a dysphoria rather than normalcy. That dysphoria was NOT ""normalized"" back where this game is set.

Worse, this is RELENTLESS throughout the game. Rebellion is making a POINT here, folks! So, when you buy this game (at any price) you ARE paying to support a flagrant and relentless woke agenda. So, vote with your money if this matters to you.

In summary, even without the wokeness, this game is quite bad and a notable decline from its predecessors. It is NOT of the quality of the previous iterations of the franchise, so I wouldn't recommend it anyway. But add in the relentless wokeness, and it's just BAD! IMO, not worth your money. BELIEVE the negative reviews (which are many and which keep noting most of the same points).

There's enough variables in each shot to make you question ""do I really need to take this shot or can I find a better angle"" or something similar to that affect that keeps the player honest rather and the game from feeling like a shooting gallery. The story, meh, typical bad guys are bad plot and gritty monologues by the main character, but you're not here for a Quentin Tarantino level story. 

As for the negatives, the weapon selection feels sparse and there's not much variation to make the player ask which weapon is best for certain missions. That said, the weapons are more than adequate in function and feel. I suppose the two biggest negatives are the bullet-xray cinematics are too common and extremely distracting during co-op missions since you both will view each other's kills. You can turn it off, but that feels like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Lastly and most infuriating is the player movement, either your character's spirit animal is a newborn giraffe or the game developers need to take extensive notes from the previous Sniper Elite installment to develop a better solution. 

Summary: Great game, there's enough chance and acceptable amount of ""I didn't see that coming"" with each shot you take to keep the game from feeling like a fish in a barrel simulator. The maps are vast, as expected and take about 1.5hrs to complete each thoroughly. The main issues are the bullet-xray cam being overused in single player and too distracting in co-op. You can turn it off, but then you miss it entirely. Worst of all, the movement mechanics are C L U N K Y! Be prepared to miss ladders and fight to fit through a doorway.

only thing noteworthy to mention is the axis mode, it can be really fun to tackle invading snipers or even be the invader, but sometimes it becomes a walking simulator when invading, having no idea where the sniper is until he gets really paranoid and leaves the game...",1672920875,1672920957,False,4,0,0.54256206750869751,0,True,False,False

+ One of the few games which supports crossplay PC - Xbox One/Series, for me it was a key point since my partner has only Xbox SX at his disposal
+ Cooperative and invading are fun as hell. It’s not just a tactical stealth action, but can be also highly dynamic: no one forces you to be silent all the time, even on hard difficulty.
+ AI is surprisingly smart and creative.
+ The locations design: these meadows, lakes and castles are very pleasing for eyes.
+ Except a few glitches, this game works quite stable and does not irritate you with crashes/endless bugs/syncing problems.
Cons:
- Visual shimmering and ugly distant aliasing, it hurts my eyes and makes precision aiming/spotting enemies more challenging, especially if the screen resolution is 1080p or below (VRS/DSR doesn't help). DLSS/FFX 2.0 could solve a problem, but this engine doesn't support it - only outdated and terrible Fidelity FX 1.0
- Game design sometimes forces you to wander around the map for some nonsense. Why can't I crack the lock with bazooka or mine, but need a damn satchel which could be very difficult to find? Or in one mission I was looking for a valve for 15 mins.
- Clunky controls. For example, there are no keys to use medicine or grenade, you have to choose the thing and then use F, so in some instances you accidentally explode yourself instead of healing.
- Lackluster story - it is NOT a dealbreaker here. Thanks for the developer all cutscenes can be skipped.
I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10: strongly recommend it for walkthrough with your friends, especially considering the fact that there are not many cool options for crossplay.

Positive:
- There is more difference between the rifles than in 4, so you can select a rifle that suits you. Be aware that special kills get you more rifles
- As usual, large missions with a lot of freedom. Good maps with a lot of detail and great atmosphere. So a fun a experience. If you pay 30 Euro for it, that is a good price. Took me 34 hrs to finish on medium difficulty
- Complete personal difficulty setting with many details included. Experiment with this
- High replay value
Mediocre/bad  
- The game engine is a bit outdated. The looks are great but the movement is clumsy and erratic., especially fast movement. Reacts poorly to mouse when moving/steering
- The slow motion cam and X-ray cam get boring fast so personally I switch them off. 
- Both you and your enemies are bullet sponges (at medium difficulty) so soldiers will walk away from 20 bullets with a machine gun. That kind of mechanics do fit not this game. But you can adjust this in the difficulty settings
- there is a ,lot of indoor fighting and short range fighting. probably 50% sniping and sneaking, 30% pistol action and 20% just gunning and blowing stuff up. I found myself looking for opportunities to do more sniping!
- the skill points don't seem to do a lot or add a lot. So the ranking does little , as it did in the previous games.
Verdict:
I would rate it a somewhere between a 7-8 out of 10. All in all a good game with replay value",1672599622,1672736075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The maps feel more empty. There seems to be more space between groups of troops in some maps. There isn't the pressure to assassinate troops to move forward with out being located. SE4 in my opinion took some strategy to get maps accomplished with out starting over. This may be do there being no authentic plus. Me and my friend played SE4 the last DLC map multiple times before we were able to complete it and it was fun. That's because it was challenging. I think Rubble and Ruin is probably the map that feels like SE4. There loads of troops everywhere in that map with constant battle to take part in, or attempt to avoid had that SE4 feel.

The gun play, movement, and customization are fantastic(Excluding them messing up the m30 drilling in one of the dlc) and make the game feel like gold. However the maps and enemies are awful. The maps are beautiful but lack the challenge that the older games had, they try to give you more options in ways to do the mission but instead make it so that you can just hide in spots away from enemies and never have to worry about actual combat. The map design makes stealth so easy that you could accidentally stealth missions. The enemy AI is ridiculously stupid if you do end up getting spotted instead of shooting at you sometimes they will just stare at you, or turn around and sprint towards the alarm, but don't worry about the alarm as you can just shoot it and then hide in a corner for 30 seconds and suddenly everyone forgets you even existed. Even on the hardest difficulty the game is not hard enemies die from being breathed on and shoot toothpicks at you opposed to bullets, the AI is what makes the game so easy in combination with the map design.

- headless chicken AI
- bullet-sponge enemies in authentic mode

- enemy animations are ridiculously quick

The first is much improved AI behaviour. I bumped into an SS officer running up the stairwell in the hotel on the first level and tried to melee kill him. He fought back, blocking 4 or 5 of my attempts and we both struggled to grab out sidearms. He was faster than I was and I went down. Very nice and a huge surprise. It is nearly impossible to fire a weapon completely unnoticed. The AI's will systematically hunt you down, working together to surround you and flush you out. They will sneak up behind you all the time. Watch your 6.

The other innovation in SE5 is non-lethal mode. There is non-lethal ammo and a non-lethal melee takedown. You get extra points for this, and it's generally quieter than a kill melee, so you can do this standing right next to another AI without alerting them.

So far I've played the first level through with all the defaults, and then in Authentic Mode which I find far more enjoyable. I use an xbox 360 controller.

Speaking of the controller, I find some of the selection mechanics really difficult and clunky. Rebellion needs to work on this. Picking stuff up, searching bodies, and even choosing things from the inventory wheel is just way too hard. Maybe it's easier with the keyboard/mouse. Dunno. Needs fixing.

This is worth the money. Maybe in SE6 they'll start putting citizens into the maps. It's pretty much the only thing missing now.",1672239300,1672239300,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I was skeptical of buying this game because I saw the reviews with the crashes and various bugs - it appears the devs have fixed the issues because I just played through with no problems so far.

Another reason why I was skeptical - people were saying that ""you can't snipe long range"" or that ""it's not a sniper game"" and it's not open world enough. To me, this game has everything you could want in an open world sniper shooter.

Approach any level with your own strategy - customize your guns to fit your style of play. It's all here.

I loved the Sniper Ghost Warrior series and this reminds me of the open play of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 with the intensity of a close combat shooter with the feeling of sniping in a movie. Dang, it has it all. 

Enemies are smarter and will hunt you down realistically. Stealth is more realistic too. You can't just knock a guy out and expect no one to notice. Enemy officers check in on their squads...if they find that it's too quiet or that no one is communicating (because you killed the whole squad), he is going to check in on them.

All I gotta say is get this game. If you like making your own path you will love it. If you like everything structured, you'll still enjoy it. 

PS - you can shoot SMGS and Pistols with Iron Sights now! And you can pick up enemy weapons and use open sights too - this opens up even more avenues for fun gameplay. I ran out of ammo fighting of 20 guys, picked up a dead soldier's MP40 mid gun fight and began to tear down bad guys. It was surreal!",1672182918,1672182918,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

For those that dont know the series, theres basically a large map you have to roam and do objectives for each mission, eventually uncovering a new nazi weapon and preventing them from using it to win the war. You fight enemies at extreme range sniping and yes enemies snipers are nasty, you fight at mid-close range with SMGs or pistols, or take enemies out through melee but sneaking around and catching them off guard.
Some solid changes are no more throwing rocks, you throw bottles now and they can knock soldiers out when you peg one in the head. I liked the rocks but i abused them thoroughly.
You arent limited to kills, you can now knock enemies out with melee or even special bullets, the advantage is faster exp gain if theyre alive at the end of the mission * you can even use them as bodies if you want multi kill medals/achieves.
Theres new types of special ammo such as AP and bleed bullets incase you wing a hiding enemy.
The authenic modes arent so much an improvement and they felt easier, your scope now has a bullet drop as well as a wind indicator that is accurate and makes authentic sniping alot easier, theres also further ranged shots to do, one as far as 1,870m that i know of that i managed to do in authentic, i enjoyed the authentic and theres no achievement requirement of completing on authentic with no saves.
Theres a focus mode where you can see the outline of enemies making noise nearby, not available in authentic, they dont make it that easy.
Multi player is also active.
I wont spoil it too much but you will definitely enjoy this especially if you like SE4.
The only thing i legitimately dont like is they have removed the crouch running that SE4 has, they should also think about tackle kills where you can run at an enemy and smash/stab them into the ground which would be good if theyre looking into a bush and you want to quickly charge them and get back into hiding.",1671532048,1671534463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update 01/12/2022:
The game used to run on linux (albeit without multiplayer, obviously because of anticheat, which is fine) but then the latest update bricked it. Kind of a deal breaker for me.

Update 01/07/2022:

Snipers are no longer kicked or killed for camping on the players side. I still feel like the game penalizes it a bit too much, but it's a welcome change. I have also quite been enjoying invasion mode, even with the occasional time where the game forces your patience to go unrewarded.

Original review below.

I was really excited for the new invasion mode. Seems like it would be a lot of fun!

""Enemy sniper was eliminated for camping"" I'm sorry, what? It's already bad enough that the axis player basically gets led to the enemy, but then you just get deleted for camping? Sniping is a game of campers at it's best! Getting and keeping a key vantage point is super important to any sniper. Snipers, by nature, are campers. That's the whole point. I want my enemy to be able to camp if they want. It's no fun if the game just kills them because I was doing my job too good by cutting off their advance. 

I'm sure it's no fun for the campaign player, either.

It's kind of amazing to play this after the Plague Tale games, where the narrative is prized above all, and the game is like, ""ok after you watch this 5-minute cutscene, you can have a brief stealth section with maybe 10 - 11 guards. But then you have to listen to 7 minutes of whispered dialog and do a puzzle!"" Sniper Elite 5 is all like, ""Uh...story? Ok! So...the Third Reich is building another superweapon called...*checks crayon scribbles*...O P E R A T I O N   K R A K E N! Now here's a gigantic map crawling with nazis, go ruin their day!"" The game absolutely does not care about the story and that is just fine with me. Every map is [i]terrifyingly[/i] gigantic and will give you hours upon hours of sneaking around nazi installations, sabotaging nazi equiment, popping nazi skulls with your all-American bullets (or knife, or grenade, etc). And it's not just that the maps are large, they are incredibly detailed - every problem has multiple solutions, every destination has multiple paths and there are multiple objectives to choose from. You can see Rebellion play around with different ideas too, like one map that takes place on an island and it looks like a normal-sized SE4 map but as you snoop around, you find that there is this sprawling underground facility with more tunnels than an ant farm. It was really cool, like being in some sort of 70s espionage film. Oh and there's also a colossal nazi castle. IMO this is by far the best level in any of the Sniper Elite games. There's so much you can do - from the starting area, you can snipe dozens of enemies, then you can wind through the streets, sneaking and knifing guards as you please, taking out elite soldiers in the sprawling beach in the back. You eventually make your way to the very top and spy on the three krauts planning the operation, assassinating them individually as they make their way to the ground floor. There was also a school for spies that sums up the many ways you can approach a challenging problem. There were about six agents and I didn't really have the twitch skills to go in guns blazing. I could have thrown a grenade, but they were spread out and I would have been spotted by the survivors. I decided to toss some TNT at three of them that were close together; of the remaining three, one of them barged through the front door, which I had prepared with a proximity mine. The others were not going to share his fate, so one made for the side door, which I had also laced with proximity mines. Finally, the remaining spy beat a hasty retreat for a secret downstairs tunnel, which I had also prepped with a proximity mine. All I had to do was hide in a corner and let out a chuckle as their tortured screams filled the afternoon air.

There isn't as much sound-masked sniping as in 3, or even 4, but there are definitely 'shooting gallery' moments where you get your chance to snipe many many guards. The rest plays like a conventional stealth game and I didn't mind that. It's almost like a WW2-era Splinter Cell game - the last level is even similar to the Korea map from Chaos Theory, with you making your way through war-torn streets and enemy propaganda blasting through loudspeakers. There are some improvements over the previous installments. You now no longer have to press a button to tag an enemy, you can just hover over them for a few seconds and they're tagged. It's now possible to alt-tab without crashing the game, which is a bonus! The ""radar"" is better now (for the difficulties that use it) - it used to portray the enemies as dots on the HUD, which was a bit too easy since you knew exactly where they were at all times. Now, there will be a large translucent white circle that only shows their general area. You can only track them once they've been tagged. The difficulty level is also very atomistic, which I appreciated. You can decide how difficult you want separate components, like the aiming, the enemy AI, the HUD, etc. You can also have ""invasions"" - a multiplayer aspect where other players can enter your level and hunt you; you can use special phones to get an idea of the invader's location, but this also gives them a hint as to where you are. I didn't try it but you may like it if you're a Dark Souls fan. There's also a skill system that feels a bit tacked-on. You gain XP to gain more skills and they're fairly unremarkable - more health points, more items in your loadout, etc. I guess it's a more tangible xp reward system than previous games, but I could have probably lived without it.

Sound design is excellent, with very vivid foley work - also, I very much appreciated hearing the germanic cursing of your name to the sky, all the while yelling out loud that they're not afraid of the mighty GHOST SNIPER. The music is quite well done but I was very amused that, because the game takes place in France, the composer makes several attempts at shoehorning an accordion into even the sinister and tense string sections. The attempt at making the accordion into a menacing instrument is [i]adorable[/i]. A for effort. The AI is ok, nothing great. If you snipe without sound masking, guards will attempt to get a bead on your location and will frantically search for where the shots are coming from - of course if you make several shots from the same location, then I hope you surrounded your nest with proximity mines! Guards can sometimes get ""stuck"" which is an example of the buggy behavior that you can sometimes see in the game. However, Rebellion has done a lot of patching and also provided a free DLC - all the bugs that I encountered were mere nuisances and never prevented me from completing any objectives. Although, if multiplayer is your thing, I've heard that the included Easy Anti-Cheat can be a huge headache and you may want to proceed with caution. I didn't test it out myself. Aside from that, I note that bottles are much more useful now...they will almost always distract the AI away, even if they're actively hunting. This can help if you need a strategic way around multiple mobs.

One of the maps had almost two hundred enemies in it. I almost felt like a pest exterminator. So what's the verdict? Well if you prefer a more tight, corralled stealth experience then the incredibly vast maps of SE5 may not be your thing.

This is nowhere close worth 50 dollars nor even the 35 I spent on sale. The game has too many issues and problems that I don't even know where to begin.

I'll start off by saying I loved Sniper Elite 3/4 for many reasons but this doesn't feel good in any regards to them.  Bugs everywhere like enemies disappearing right before your eyes, enemies randomly spawning in areas you cleared previously, no reticle when aiming, enemies floating on objects, the list goes on and on and on. For a game about sniping as well, this is the most linear open level designs I've come across in awhile. I had to replay the entire first mission again that took me 3 hrs all because the mission glitched and never gave an extraction point...which wasn't fixed till two months later by the way. Only 2 out of the 9 maps felt any fun to roam in at all and hardly any of this game actually feels good to snipe in. Enemy AI is also beyond busted with glitches of them seeing you through the map and the fact they can be both braindead as hell but have the eyes of a hawk or react to things that make no sense to react to. This games about sniping yet hardly any of the games design relies on it or uses it at all. Hardly anything to be able to soundmask shots or get into far away engagements. Even when you can soundmask using a generator or vehicle, once again the map is so poorly designed that only about 1 or 2 enemies can even be killed before it becomes useless. Rubble and Ruin was the only map in the campaign that actually managed to do a good job of this and remind me of why I like this series. 

The games optimization is pretty poor, especially for users like myself running on a 1080p monitor specifically do to their god AWFUL anti-aliasing system. Moving the camera in any direction shows off horrendous flickering/shimmering coming off just about any reflective surfaces like water, shadows, bushes and windows. Gates and doors are also heavily affected as well making this game look stunningly terrible in otherwise a really good looking game. Graphically this game looks impressive but the anti-aliasing ruins it entirely and butchers the quality of it all. Performance is a mixed bag as a whole as I currently have a 13700k, rtx 3070, and 32 gbs and see regular dips when on ultra regardless if on vulkan or dx12. Turning down certain settings has alleviated a lot of issues but it amazes me after watching an optimization guide that these settings on ultra vs medium/high show almost no graphical difference but effect fps that heavily showcasing how badly done this game was handled. 

In general too, this games design choices are also baffling. Removing the ability to throw rocks in favor of finding bottles on the map to throw around, the welrod pistol reticle hardly ever hitting where you actually aim (legit the worst pistol in a game I've ever used period), making so many map sections linear as hell or multiple floors that take ages to climb for boring ass collectibles or eliminating an enemy or two making it a time consuming waste. The new decision to make endless vehicles spawn on roads, the mission objectives practically being the same every level, and basically butchering just about everything that made the previous games good were downgraded in every capacity here. Also the new addition of the skill trees was utterly pointless as hell. Skills that add hardly ANYTHING into the game at all for such minimalistic changes. It just is such an inferior game to 3/4 which were handled with such love and care while this feels just thrown at your face. I can't even speak for the Invasion or multiplayer modes but i heard they are disasters too. Forgot to mention when it came to performance this game crashes a lot. It had crashed five times at startup and about another 4-5 times through gameplay. Just pathetic! 

When the game functions and actually plays...it's ok! That's really all I can say, it's just another sniper elite game which I expected to be a fun good game but it's more frustrating and genuinely inferior in every way instead. If I spent 10-20 bucks on it, it'd be perfectly fine. However, at the current full price and even the sales it was recently on, I cannot in good conscious recommend this to anyone right now until a very very deep sale.On top of all of this, keep in mind this game released months ago and it's still just as badly buggy now as it was then with incredibly poor optimization and crashed still happening abundantly. Save your money and stay away from this and just grab Sniper Elite 3 or 4 for under 10 bucks instead for a much better and cheaper experience.",1653804771,1670893522,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I've been a big fan of this series since Sniper Elite V2 was released, with Sniper Elite 4 being my favorite by far. So, most of this review will be written as a comparison to Sniper Elite 4. I haven't played any multiplayer yet (including the invasion mode of the single player campaign), so this is going to mainly be about the campaign.

For starters, the graphics are better than SE4...hands down. The maps/map design was maybe on par with SE4--the maps/levels seemed to be a little bigger, but ultimately they were roughly the same as far as size and potential routes/paths go. The ability to traverse the maps--whether through climbing vines or using ziplines--seemed more in-depth and varied (and using ziplines is fun too).

The ""Kill List"" objectives to unlock weapons was entertaining at least, but they weren't very hard to do. And while the weapon customization is nice (and the task of finding the workbenches adds a nice little side challenge to each mission), I feel as though recoil control, aim stability and suppressor upgrades are the only worthwhile rifle upgrades. Here's why:

The longest shot I was able to make in the campaign was around 475m in the Spy Academy mission if I remember correctly, and that involved a lot of positioning myself to make that long distance possible. Outside of that shot and a couple others in ""Rubble and Ruin,"" the average shot distance in a campaign mission I was able to pull off--just by roughly guesstimating--is somewhere between 100m and 200m. That was a bit of a disappointment to me, as in the *very first* mission of SE4, you are able to make about 12-14 shots (maybe more) that are between 200m and 400m without going very far from the starting position. So, unless there are ""hidden"" or ""secret"" long shots (kinda like in SE3)...muzzle velocity, scope zoom level, and match grade ammo is all but useless unless you just hate compensating for wind and gravity.

The ""sped up"" weapon reloads seem more like a multiplayer gimmick to me, as does the ""focus"" ability that basically gives you free wall hacks for a certain period of time. I also miss the items/inventory wheel of SE4 where you had nothing but lethal traps/explosives, health items and unlimited rocks/a whistle. You could really make some mayhem in those days. In SE5, your only lethal options are a landmine, grenade, or TNT (and I only really used time-delayed TNT to destroy vehicles when I couldn't get close enough to use a satchel charge or I couldn't find a Panzerfaust), you have a limited supply of bottles--which took the place of rocks, which were unlimited--and the non-lethal Schu Mines...well....I didn't use them once, since the only time you need to knock somebody unconscious is for the Kill List challenge where you have to kill the one officer by burying him in concrete, and you can KO somebody by using your knife/melee takedown. The decoys weren't really useful either, since if you take the right skills, people will get tagged if they shoot at you...which means you don't need to throw out a decoy to get their position.

The skill upgrades were nice, but most of them were either useless, or weren't necessary/very helpful. Like, yeah...it's nice to be able to have enemies get temporarily tagged when they shoot at me, but isn't that what the decoy is for? You can get by without using traps for the entire campaign (ask me how I know) so you really don't need an increased supply of those or be able to throw them down faster, yeah the ""focus"" skill is nice...but that's basically free wall hacks for a certain period of time. The only ones worth it to me would be the ones that give you slots for special ammo, and the ones that reduce how fast your heart rate rises. And even to that point, the only special ammo that is worth your time would be the AP ammo so you can one-shot enemies through their helmet with your Pistol & SMG, or destroy vehicles in fewer shots.

When it came to the enemies and how hard they were to conquer...I was again disappointed. I found them more annoying than challenging (I was playing on Sniper Elite difficulty, the one where you have to compensate for both distance and wind), and I was able to go through the whole campaign without dying at the hands of the enemy (I can honestly say that the only times I died was because I stood too close to a satchel charge, or because I took hella fall damage from trying to parkour my way through the level). The engineers were cool in that they could undo/fix your sabotaged generator or truck to take away your soundmasking, and the snipers caused you to be extra careful unless you wanted a ""bleeding"" wound that forced you to use one of your precious med items...but everyone else was just kinda...a nuisance rather than a credible threat. The enemy variety is roughly the same as SE4: radio operators and spotters were replaced by gunners and engineers. Most everyone else you already know and love, with a few variants sprinkled in (like Vampir Jagers or Elite Snipers).

Even the vehicles weren't hard to deal with. If you can't satchel charge them, if there isn't a Panzerfaust nearby, or you can't use a landmine to stop them, just lob some TNT on a timer near them and call it good--it might take two or three TNTs, but it'll work. Run out of TNT before that King Tiger went boom? Just load some AP ammo in your weapon of choice (whether it be the Welrod, MP40 or something else) and just keep shooting the glowing red area.

Satchel charges are either useless or the only key you'll ever need, depending on whether you want to go full stealth or guns blazing. If you take the time and have the patience to take out everyone on the map or hunt down officers...you probably won't need satchel charges unless an objective specifically calls for you to use a satchel charge. Or alternatively, you can just blast your way through doors, safes and walls since you can usually find more than enough to get you through the mission.

The ending was really anti-climactic as well. ""That is quite some distance Mr. Fairburne..."" *Binoculars say the distance is 230m to the target* ""Hurry! Before he gets away!"" *Target stops on a balcony, then leisurely strolls to his car before slowly driving away* Sniper Elite V2's final shot was harder than the final shot in this one.

TL;DR While I'm not too disappointed with SE5, I was honestly expecting more. The enemies aren't really a challenge, most traps are useless, and almost half the weapon upgrades seem useless unless you really just want to have a laser beam of a gun that laughs in the face of wind and gravity. There isn't really a lot of opportunity for taking long distance shots (200m or further), unless you really look for them or are willing to do the necessary legwork to set up a long shot. And even if you take your time and go through each mission slowly...the campaign still seems really short. Blasting people with the anti-tank rifle was really fun though, I would recommend using the anti-tank rifle on infantry and nothing else.

All things considered, SE5 isn't a bad game...but I believe that SE4 is better.",1670804682,1670804682,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

These games remind me of what I liked so much about the older Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games back when they were single-player only.  They focus on a vibrant single player story, fun game play and polished level design instead of just large bland arenas designed for endless PvP.  The name says ""Sniper Elite"" but the game allows you to play however you want.  Want to snipe from hundreds of meters away and play ""pop goes the Nazi""?  Great!  Want to set up an explosive booby trap for nosy patrolling enemy?  No problem!  Want to charge into a bunker and clean it out with an SMG?  Go for it!  The missions drop you in a large open-world-ish map (each mission gets it's own specific map) with a couple known objectives along with some extra objectives that can be found while playing.  Apart from that, you are free to chose how you complete them and in what order.  The maps are also beautifully designed (aside from occasional invisible wall) and suit the story and missions well.  The over all result feels like a classic WWII action movie.

I also enjoy that the series knows what it wants to be and keeps polishing the concept and expanding it.  The games are not very realistic (taking out a tank with a few well-placed rifle rounds??  lol!)  but much more importantly they are FUN to play.  The enemy AI is not brilliant but they will take cover, attempt to flank your position and raise alarms to call in their nearby allies.  There are lots of collectibles to find and things to unlock which gives it more replay value than most single player game IMHO.  

My one minor criticism is that it is often easy to chose a defensible location, setup a few booby traps and make a grand racket to piss off half the enemies on the map and then wipe them out as the try to storm your location, leaving you to explore the map unbothered afterwards.  I played on  ""Sharpshooter"" (medium?) difficulty though, so this might be less true on higher difficulty settings?  Also, the enemy models in kill-cams sometimes seem to lock solid in their death animations which looks a bit awkward?  A more random rag-doll animation might be better.

Sniper Elite 5 is the most polished yet but V2, 3 and 4 are also excellent and worth playing as well.  I got the versions with DLC included and enjoyed the DLC missions as well.  These games usually have great deals on Steams sales too.",1670693982,1670694486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Large maps with things to explore and uncover
+ Long shot opportunities in each map
+ Satisfying stealth
+ Weapon customisation gives nice options*
+ Looks good

Cons:
- Weapon customisation makes room for nightmare guns and allows for far too many muzzle devices: of coruse you don't have to customise.
- Karl Fairburne still fails to pronounce German properly. Odd for a covert op guy who supposedly speaks fluent German. If it s ajoke in the spirit of 1950s war movies, make that more apparent.
- Characters thin as ever
- Odd bugs, such as lower difficulty aids popping up when playing on Authentic.
- No Tripwires or S-mines. :( :(

Still recommend. Not as good a game as SE 4 but a robust atmospheric piece of stealth action.

but i can say this for sure now, SE5 has made SE4 almost unplayable for me now, it makes a series of changes or refinements to the game play that makes it just a better overall experience for me, i can play on higher difficulties with more fun and similar challenge to SE4, and it really gives that feeling i loved about Metal Gear Solid games, sneaking through enemy encampments to achieve a goal. you even have a huge array of methods both lethal and non lethal to choose from. but its Sniper Elite so lethal is for sure the more fun way. 

Only thing SE5 does worse than SE4 is the Xrays and Kill cams. in SE4 i loved leaving the longer cams on as they felt like an event seeing the full path of the bullet from the gun to the target and seeing clearly what the damage and location hit. but in SE5, the camera leaves bits out while the bullet travels and the Xray of the hits, is a bit messy, i think they added too much detail to the Xrays as compared to SE4. but i like leaving the quick kill cams on for SE5 so you can get that nice feedback of a good shot even at huge distances.

overall, this is an excellent game and i truly think its the best in the series and for anyone who wants that MGS stealth feel even though its WW2",1657568162,1670277701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Missions take place in ruined cities, rural towns, and fortified German strongholds. Each location is quite large and contains multiple main and secondary objectives. There are usually a few different paths to move around each map.

•	You can equip a sniper rifle, SMG, and pistol. There are several different types of each weapon to unlock, and most of the ones I tried felt pretty good to use.

•	Each weapon can be customised with mods which are unlocked by finding workbenches hidden around each map. You can adjust stats such as damage, rate of fire, clip size, recoil, noise range, and reload speed. 

•	You can also carry various useful items such as medkits, grenades and mines. In addition to defending narrow chokepoints and doorways, one of my favourite uses for explosives was to booby trap corpses of enemy soldiers so that when someone else came to investigate, I’d eliminate them too.

•	Most enemies are equipped with the same pistols, SMGs and rifles that the player can use. You’ll also encounter a few armoured cars and tanks, so be on the lookout for panzerfaust RPGs.

•	There are a few ways to take advantage of stealth, including silenced weapons and sneaking up behind enemies for melee takedowns. You can whistle and throw bottles to cause nearby enemies to investigate the noise. And if there are loud environmental noises such as planes flying overhead, or cannons firing, this can mask the sound of your rifle fire. However, each map has a large number of enemies, and they can see you over quite a long distance, so I found it hard to stay hidden for long. 

•	When alerted to your presence, the AI will quickly identify your location and aggressively chase you, usually with multiple soldiers from different directions. Objective locations often have alarms which will summon more reinforcements until you disable the alarm. During a couple of missions I had lengthy and very chaotic firefights against massive numbers of enemies.

•	I played on the hard difficulty and while I died a few times on each mission, it was rarely frustrating. Most of my deaths resulted from attempting to be stealthy and messing up in an exposed location. When I started just shooting everyone on sight from a more tactically secure location, it actually became much easier.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	The writing and voice acting are both average quality. The story only really exists to give you a reason to perform each mission objective.

•	The story doesn’t connect to the previous games in any significant way, so if you haven’t played the other games you wouldn’t feel like you’re missing anything.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 14 hours to complete the campaign and I only missed 2 optional objectives. There’s also a survival mode where you have to fight multiple waves of enemies while defending a control point, which could provide a few more hours of playtime.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

•	I didn’t have any crashes or framerate problems.

•	I noticed a frequent flicker/shimmer effect on distant objects like trees and narrow railings, which I think might be caused by poor anti-aliasing. You can’t choose which type to use, you can only select low/medium/high/ultra, which didn’t seem to make any difference.

•	There is some inconsistency relating to whether or not you can climb over walls and other waist high objects. Sometimes I approached an object that my eyes told me should be climbable, but the game wouldn’t let me interact with it.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Sniper Elite 5 is a good game that has fun and challenging combat, but is let down slightly by average storytelling and a couple of technical issues. I think most action game fans will probably enjoy the game.

Overall quality is roughly similar to Sniper Elite 4, so if you liked the previous game you should enjoy SE5 too. It might be best to wait for a sale, especially if you also want the season pass (which I haven’t bought yet).",1670229410,1670229410,True,34,0,0.781719803810119629,1,True,False,False

I played the first mission and was very happy with it.
Then the worst thing happened, an update was released with a couple of DLCs and weapon skins. This is where I have a problem.
1. The size of the update was around the same of the original game = 47GB.
2. Once the update completed, the game just does not launch now. I am on Windows 10 and the answer given by devs is update to the latest version of Windows. In what age are we living where to play the new DLC of an already installed game, I need to update the entire OS ? On top of it, there is no way to rollback the update. 
This is the worst form of software development I have seen with zero care given to the users. This mode of break and release is okay if the user is not paying for the software.

For prospective buyers, this is what I see - ""Can't find the entry point for procedure NotifyNetworkConnectivityHintChange on dynamic link library"". I know very little about game development and windows software development, but this just reeks of breaking backward compatibility.

I'm a massive fan of the Sniper Elite series and in my opinion Sniper Elite 5 lives up to the series, though it is not a substantial leap in quality over Sniper Elite 4 in the same way Sniper Elite 4 was over 2 and 3. It's more of a side step, with certain areas improved, others worse, and others changed. 

There's been a ton of negativity surrounding this game, and while certainly it lacks the polish of 4, I think it has enough alterations to the formula over 4 that it can stand alongside 4 as a great Sniper game. While I don't think it is as well realized of a game as 4 (all of the components of that game worked together perfectly to make a game greater than the sum of its parts), I love the increased complexity of the game. I found the levels were larger in scope and more varied than 4, not just in terms of visual design but also in layout, approach, and gameplay. Along with the complete weapon customizability and non-lethal ammo types, there is far more player agency in the levels. While it doesn't have much positive gameplay function, I found the non-lethal options were a fun player-imposed challenge, and its honestly also fun to be a complete bastard and play judge, jury, and executioner based on what it says on the individual enemies bios. I also appreciated the fact that you get updates on the games missions/side missions by exploring the level itself and reading documents/overhearing conversations. I found the game generally easier and the sniping more forgiving than 4, but its still plenty challenging if you want it to be. Being able to unlock different starting locations for missions is a great touch as well. The biggest negative for me is that it is reasonably buggy, particularly with AI and animations, though this has improved quite a bit since launch. I really like the music as well. Different themes for the different levels is an awesome touch, and I really appreciate the more organic way the music changes based on the alert state of the enemies, over 4 which was often far too explicit in its music an audio cues. 

Sniper Elite 5 is not Sniper Elite 4, and I think in accepting that you'll come to find that 5 is a very good game indeed. I was pretty disappointed by this game after launch (probably in large part due to its super buggy state), but have come around to love it. It's refreshing to play a game that's super straightforward and gameplay focused without the fat and nonsense, though I still don't see that a skill tree is necessary in this game. 

There is a TON of content in the base game too, especially in considering the reduced MSRP. The single player levels are more expansive than they have ever been, you have multiplayer (which I am not much of a fan of in general but IMO the multiplayer in 5 is an undeniable improvement over 4), survival (a personal favorite game mode of mine) and invasion, which is an awesome, awesome addition.

This is Sniper Elite 4 but in France. The game side-actions have been "" re-balanced "" with some items being removed, new items added, weapon customisation, workbenches being divided into 3 different types ( which then gives you even more incentive to check out all the massive/beautiful maps ), and Not every vehicle can be explosion exploited by shooting the gas tank ( fair enough ).

Stealth is now moreso of a factor, so prepare to spend 99% of your time crouching through the map with the other 1% sprinting the fuck away from something. Weapons now emit "" noise "", yes, even when silence ( realism huh ), but you can reduce the sound distance with various types of mod's depending on what you want.


Overall, I give it a 3/10 ( still a bit buggy, but its a brand new game ), but players expecting a "" new Sniper Elite "" game shouldnt have their hopes up, as there isnt much "" new "" about it, even the graphics ( I am running 3070 RTX )

If you go into this expecting a slightly re-balanced SE4 with roughly 30+ hours of content in campaign alone, you wont be disappointed.

>> Post-Campaign Edit <<

Changed my overall score from 9/10 to 5/10. Reasons:

- Traversal is terrible. Less buildings to climb even though you can see the pipes, map templates such as cutting fences sometimes dont have the trigger or take several attempts to activate the animation, a fair few open farm field maps where your forced down road choke-points with nowhere to hide even though you can see a stone fence that you should be able to jump over, hedge templates in one map will work in one area but wont work in another area even though you can physically walk around the hedge and go to the place you were looking at 30 seconds ago.... to sum this comment up, Map beautiful, traversal garbage.

- Axis Invasion. Not explained well enough, so no one knows how to turn it on/off even though its quite clear. There is an XP "" detriment "" if you have it turned off, but its such an incomprehensibly small difference that it makes no sense... I turned Axis Invasion off for the entire campaign and was max level by 80-90% of the standard game. Some more explanation from Rebellion about Axis Invasion would make it feel a lot better, as we dont have control over what games we get inserted into as an Axis Sniper, yet some people are clearly uncomftorble with this concept as they resort to camping, restarting the mission, or simply suiciding just to get the Axis Invader to leave lol..... so a little more clarity so that new players dont feel harrassed would be better....

- They added removed a lot of guns but then added customisation to the guns to give you more "" choice "". Every upgrade has a positive attribute, but also 1-3 negative attributes. Whilst this is a welcomed addition, some of the upgrades are very copy-pasted and dont directly relate to the firearm. For example the "" M24 "" rifle that everyone starts with, I can max the damage and stability of the rifle, but the downside is I need to worry about horizontal/vertical recoil? With a bolt action rifle?.... as I said... great addition, not very well planned or thought out.

- SPOILER ALERT -
Missions are very typical of the SE format. Go here, destroy radio comms, blow up this super-gun, find the snipers, kill this guy ( on every map ), find the intel, get out. They added non-lethal ammunition to the game, but didnt provide any mission specific uses or benefits for the ammunition. Basically a complete redundancy. They also have quite easily given away where they want to go next, with the addition of the WW2 Japanese forces to the end of the game, so dont be surprised if the next game finally leaves Europe and heads to the pacific ( which, to be fair, there isn't much left of europe to do, maybe they could do africa? )

>> POST FIRST TWO DLC RELEASES EDIT <<

Its still just SE4 but rebalanced. They have actually listened to me and fixed a lot of the UI issues, thanks.

They however have done nothing about rebalancing what weapon attachments do to weapons, i:e, bolt action rifles can still add attachments that give "" more recoil "", effin lol.

As for the DLC, ->> MORE SPOILERS <-.

Cmon Rebellion jesus christ, where is your originality. You make us wait 3-4 months to see the first DLC map, and its another effin BLOW UP THE BIG GUN mission... like FFS... There are literrally hundreds of things you could do, like, for example, finally give us a mission where the NON-LETHAL AMMO ( effin lmao ) Can actually be used to complete a mission objective? Like an aggressive kidnapping mission etc? Please stop with the THEY HAVE ANOTHER BIG GUN!?!?, Its so copy and paste and honestly I cant be the only one tired of doing it. And you not only give us ANOTHER BIG GUN mission, but give us THE EXACT SAME WAYS to destroy it? * sabotage the ammunition *.... HOnestly wtf.

The second DLC is somewhat, half decent. Finally an assassination mission, yet so utterly devoid of long range shots it leaves you really wanting for something more than 200m. That and the target never walks near his window UNTIL you make it inside the castle and his movement gets triggered, but then its not really worth it to run ALL THE WAY out of the castle just to set up a window shot because then you would have to RUN ALL TEH WAY BACK IN to the castle and climb to the top to end the mission... effin lol.

Thanks for the DLC, I havent had the game installed for almost 4 months now. Installed it today, completed both DLC missions with 3 stars and all work benches discovered, over 100 kills each map with a stealth/lethal emphasis, and then promptly un-installed the game again.

Im already playing it on the highest difficulty, yeah, ok, I can go snooping for collectables. But the weapons availability really only points in the direction of 2 rifles, one SMG and one pistol. The rest are almost useless in 90% of any of the situations.

Meh. Rant over.

Most detailed sniping with different bullet types available.
Can use suppressors with super sonic bullets, which does affect enemy detection range.

Cons:
Campaign is too short but that is every one of these games. Difficulty isn't as hard as previous authentic experience since there are save points available.
the enemy snipers did not feel hard to counter/the scope glint is way too noticeable in settings that don't make sense, such as at night.

I can see that the game has come a long way and become better specially the Multiplayer.
Multiplayer maps are improved and there are less areas for campers and far less windows to watch, players are more free to move and also kill.
It's easier to find enemies or mark them for your teammates.

But the game suffers from graphical and game play bugs that needs to be addressed ASAP.

Getting into a vantage point, marking everyone with binos, going on a headshot killing spree getting killcams over and over is just an absolute blast as it always was in the past games. The problem is everything else with the game.

This game is no splinter cell, it is not metal gear, it is not hitman, yet they try to pull these stealth games off without actually keeping in mind what made those games fun and fair.

Splinter cell had the visibility meter, actual good cover system, and a multitude of silent gadgets to use.

Metal gear had camo meter, soliton radar that actually worked, and again a plethora of gadgets and things to use to distract and take down guards

Hitman had the giant levels like this game does, except they were actually designed well. Plus it had the most important part, the disguise mechanic and just an overall better focus mechanic. Hitman's is not at all awkward to use, yet this game's is. Idk how that's possible when this game came out after the Hitman trilogy has been out but is what it is.

Overall get it on a sale like I did, for 30 bucks I can take part in the actual fun sniping but man do these levels just grind my gears with how frustrating and tedious in their design. Enemies can spot you from 200 meters away, still no actual ADS for weapons so you're left up to the bloom gods with close range weapons, too many close quarters areas that you need to go into that you can't snipe in, in SNIPER ELITE. 4 was way more open with its levels which allowed much more sniping, which caused me to like that game tremendously more.",1669614743,1669614743,False,123,4,0.723869919776916504,6,True,False,False

Little things like the flash of a telescope or very visible characters in the multiplayer are annoying - it's impossible to hide somewhere, aim and shoot - such dances behind the cover. In the campaign, the characters are not so visible, there is a more gray monochromatic scenery, where the enemies blend in more with the surroundings - there are places where you have to look closely to spot them (and graphics settings are set to High and over 60 FPS, RX 6600 XT). And somewhere I read a review that the shooting distances are smaller than in the previous parts. My opinion on this subject is that compared to the previous parts, the scale of the maps is different, what in the previous parts was about 300m, now it is 200m - that's my impression. And weapon modifications are exaggerated in my opinion - well, where for a handgun a long stock, or a metal one, and an additional handle, or armor-piercing ammunition. fun with modifications that forcibly turn a pistol into a shotgun.
Updates are the worst. Well, once a week, name, u,. I turn on the computer on Saturday and want to play - NOOO, now a few GB update. Now (July 27, 22) 44GB update again!! Come on, control yourself - the whole game was downloading 55GB during installation, and then another 6GB if I remember correctly. So that you can play without updating and turn it on after the end of the game, that's how I understand it, but steam wants it now and it's over. It's annoying.

In the end, I don't know if I can recommend it or not. Because if some fan of the series (probably I am, but a staunch believer), expects similarity to the previous parts, it's a bit of an old ""sniper"", but more stealth and melee combat than ranged combat. Opponents, on the other hand, look for the ""intruder"" more, searching not only those parts of the map where they were on duty, but also other parts. Because the map is divided into parts to do specific tasks. And as in the older ""snipers"" the opponents moved only in one part of the map, so in the ""five"" they also search in other parts where they did not have a patrol. And there are units that raise an alarm, which causes the arrival of reinforcements from other ""parts"" of the map, or, for example, from passing vehicles - when they notice a corpse or hear shots.
As someone new and this will be his first contact with this series of games, he may not fully feel the atmosphere that was in the previous parts. I personally do not regret the purchase. However, I liked the multiplayer maps and the overall graphics (colors, contrast) more in ""4"" - because ""3"" is a cheater's paradise.
I recommend five, but conditionally. If someone expects a graphical revolution and similar gameplay as in its predecessors, then no, but if he is open to changes in the way the game is played and more gray graphics (in my opinion) and extensive character building, then yes.

Gra jest inna niż poprzednie wersje (v2,3,4), ale nie jest zła. Wkurzają drobnostki, jak błysk lunety , czy bardzo widoczne postacie w multi - nie sposób gdzieś się przyczaić , wycelować i strzelić - takie tańce za osłoną. W kampanii tak widoczne postacie nie są, jest bardziej szara jednobarwna sceneria, gdzie przeciwnicy bardziej zlewają się z otoczeniem - są miejsca, gdzie trzeba się dobrze przyjrzeć, aby ich wypatrzeć (a ustwienia grafiki na High i ponad 60 FPS, RX 6600 XT). No i gdzieś czytałem recenzję, że odległości oddawania strzałów mniejsze niż w poprzednich częściach. Moje zdanie na ten temat takie, że porównując do poprzednich części, skala map jest inna, to co w poprzednich częściach było około 300m, teraz jest 200m - takie moje wrażenie. No i modyfikacje broni są wg mnie przesadzone - no gdzie do podręcznego pistoletu długa kolba, lub metalowa, i dodatkowa rękojeść, czy amunicja przeciwpancerna., rozumiem modyfikacje lufy, dodawanie tłumików, zmiana spustu, optyki, ale takie z tamtego okresu, a tak mamy zabawę z modyfikacjami, które na siłę zmieniają pistolet w strzelbę.
Najgorsze są za to aktualizacje. No, raz na tydzień ,imi,u,. Włączam w sobotę komputer i chcę zagrać -NIEEE, teraz aktualizacja kilka GB. Teraz (27.07.22r) znowu 44 GB aktualizacji!! No opanujcie się - cała gra  przy instalacji pobierała 55GB,  a potem jeszcze 6GB jak dobrze pamiętam.  Żeby mozna grać bez aktualizacji, a włączyć ją po zakończeniu gry, to tak rozumiem, ale steam chce teraz i koniec. Denerwujące to jest.

Na koniec nie wiem, czy mogę polecić, czy nie. Bo jeśli jakiś fan serii (chyba takim jestem, ale niezagorzałym wyznawcą), spodziewa się podobieństwa do poprzednich części, to troszkę jest to stary ""snajper"", ale więcej w nim skradania i walki wręcz niż walki na dystans. Przeciwnicy za to bardziej szukają ""intruza"", przeszukując nie tylko te fragmenty mapy, gdzie pełnili służbę, ale i inne części. Bo mapa jest podzielona na części do zrobienia konkretnych zadań. I jak w starszych ""snajperach"" przeciwnicy poruszali się tylko w jednej części mapy, tak w ""piątce"" szukają też w innych częściach, gdzie nie mieli patrolu. No i jeszcze są jednostki wszczynające alarm, który powoduje nadejście posiłków z innych ""części"" mapy, lub np z przejeżdżających pojazdów - jak zauważą trupa, lub usłyszą strzały. 
Jak ktoś nowy i to będzie jego pierwszy kontakt z tą serią gier, to może nie do końca poczuć klimat jaki był w poprzednich częściach. Ja osobiście nie żałuję zakupu. Jednak mapy w multi i ogólnie oprawa graficzna (barwy, kontrast) bardziej podobały mi się w ""4"" - bo ""3""  to raj cziterów. 
Piątkę polecam, ale warunkowo. Jak ktoś się po niej spodziewa rewolucji graficznej i podobnej rozgrywki co w poprzedniczkach, to nie, ale jeśli jest otwarty na zmiany sposobu rozgrywki i bardzie szaroburej grafiki (wg mnie) i rozbudowanego budowania charakterystyki postaci, to tak.",1658943391,1669472834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The invasion mechanic is logical to include as an option but represents exactly what I dont want from this type of game, its personal preference and I dont mind PVP but there are so many pvp fps games that include sniping (basically all of them) out there already (I dont want everything in life to be tense, infact I play games to get away from stress most of the time).  Also the focus on non-lethal is kind of lame, sure you can knock someone unconscious but they could wake up at any point (seconds, mins who knows) and unless you tie them up they could easily wake up and either raise the alarm or attack you. It just comes across as forced, commandos were executed by german forces in WW2 as were resistance fighters, infact they would execute your family and anyone you knew too just for good measure.

I found myself taking the levels slowly, exploring it all, and enjoying every moment of them.

My only gripe (which I got used to as the game progressed) were the silencers on weapons. I understand this is 'WW2 silencer technology' and I was playing on a harder difficulty. But damn, there were multiple instances where I couldn't BELIEVE that my shot and / or silent take-down was heard.

Didn't mess around with Axis Invasion as I personally dislike my single player experiences being messed with. But what I've heard and seen from others is that it's super fun if you're into that stuff.

	So if you have played any of the other 4 games you pretty much know how this works…. You have been tasked to infiltrate your way through a number of locations to weaken the enemies fortification so the fleet can stage their attacks on the Germans. Same plot as all the other games but with different locations and tasks. Ya know what, it aint broke and so no need to fix it! They even have the pretty much mandatory Hitler DLC. 

	What makes this game the best in the series you ask. Well absolutely nothing in my opinion. There are a whole slew of things I enjoyed about this game, but the only thing I feel that was added was a good coop play. If this was in part 4, I never tried it. But I did manage to cross play with a friend on their xbox for this version.

	Lets start with the looks. The game is very polished. There was a lot of attention spent on how everything looks. The smoke, explosions, weapons, and environment all look awesome. This is the best looking version of the 5. Taking that with a grain of salt, graphics have stepped up quite a bit since SE4. So that was expected. What I can say, is that the previous game had better looking locations due to its vibrant colors and focus on detail in cities. Considering this game returns back to a more gritty war environment, you loose some of that. There are some scenes that definitely show off what the game is capable of doing but they are small little sections on each level.

	Next we have the sound. No complaints about that. Voice acting is awesome with little sync issues. The acting was done in a respectable way that presents well to the overall feel of the game. Weapon sounds are done just right. They are not over bearing but definitely let you know what you are shooting. Explosions have that surround effect that just makes you feel like you just dodged something horrible.

	Then we get to the AI. Honestly I think this is where they spent the least amount of time. I consider SE3 the pinnacle of the series. It had a lot of things going for it to include a good set of AI characters. This game seams to use the halfway brain-dead logic from SE4. In one larger map, I managed to make a lot noise near a tower. Half the map ran over to investigate that. This gave me the opportunity to visit two almost three objective locations to set explosives with almost no guards around. I would say this was an isolated incident, however I was able to utilize this tactic throughout the game. I would love for them to take the AI that was in F.E.A.R. 1 and incorporate it into this game. That was the best AI I have ever seen in a shooter.

	Gameplay wise, I would say that nothing much has been changed over from previous games. The controls are intuitive and purposefully placed on a controller. The difficulty level jumps up and down depending on where you are in each map. Honestly, I think the first level was harder than some of the later levels. The game is plenty long. You are definitely getting your moneys worth. This does not even count the pass and DLC. For those looking to leader-boards or all the achievements, you will be playing this for a long while. There are so many little details like shooting a certain number of these small gnomes to keep you entertained. 

	Summing things up, The game is awesome. There is definitely a lot to do and a definite challenge in many locations. The story is on par with all the other Sniper Elite games. Graphics are really well done and complimented with a great audio experience. If you are a fan of the series or just starting out in the Sniper Elite world, you cannot go wrong with this title.

I may be crazy but my Sniper Elite favorites go this way:

1 – Sniper Elite 3 
2 – Sniper Elite 5
3 – Sniper Elite 4 & Sniper Elite 2 
4 – Sniper Elite 1 

Note:  Be careful who you shoot from long distances. I was in a level where it asked me to kill a sniper. I had my non-lethal bullets and shot him from across the region.

This is what I didn't like about the game:
- You can no longer run while crouched.
- Tripwire mines were removed, they were my favorite type of trap.
- The ability to throw rocks was removed. You can now throw empty bottles, which you can only carry a limited amount.
- [strike]You can't aim toggle anymore[/strike].
- A lot of objects that look climbable aren't. On the other side, you can actually climb pipes, which isn't highlighted in the tutorial mission.
- Only some kind of grass offers you cover from the enemies.
- When in grass or in iron sights, there is a highlight that you can't turn off around your player which ruins immersion.
- The enemy AI is not great.
- When picking up enemy weapons you can no longer switch to them completely. When they run out of bullets you will automatically drop them.
- There is a limited amount of weapons. They will probably be added back as 100 DLCs (that never really go on a big sale) in Zombie Army 4 fashion.",1655570522,1669221942,True,89,1,0.847843706607818604,5,True,False,False

Soldiers cry out in agony but no one hears them, but if I use my Welrod even farther away suddenly some soldiers seem to hear a sound. I mean. come on!?
Maps with vehicles are just the worst, specially map 2 and the Führer DLC. Not even the American army has that many vehicles which mostly appear out of nowhere and keep on coming. During mission 2 they get stuck for whatever reason at some places. I really hope that there will be more bug fixes very soon fixing the KI and changing the appearing vehicles among many other bugs ingame.

I just named a few.
Once all those bugs have been patched I'll change my opinion.

I really should have waited 1-2 more months before starting playing the game.

Played it on the release date but decided to reviewing it now, and all i can say it's ok.
If you are a fan of this franchise you know what'll expect from the game, but for newcomers who likes tactical shooter plus slightly stealth elements, i highly recommended this game and SE4.

What improvement in this game over to SE4 is actually minimal, infact some people found the level design are actually downgrade over to SE4. SE5 still carries the big open map design but they are smaller compared to SE4. Guns in this game are also highly customizable to your liking and suit your needs. 

For newcomers i really recommended playing this game atleast with Sniper Elite (hard) difficulty. Enemies are very brutal and lethal. Wind, sound firing and gravity are your enemies so you'll need to calculate the ranges between you and your enemies, each decission/shot matters. If you're playing with go all Rambo you'll be punished really hard. Yes this game can be very challenging for some people but that's the charm of this franchise.

- SE games were never about plot but gameplay and gameplay in this game is absolutely brilliant. If you look at the SE4 plotline for example you can literally guess the ending as you are introduced to the german informat guy(forgot his name cause plotlines in this series are always just an excuse for gameplay).
- Bugs on the first days of release are expected and I see many people complain about these. Personally I haven't experienced many bugs so I can't really talk about that.
- I've seen many people complain about the fact that helmets are actually acting as helmets and not just leather caps. Most of the time your bullet will still penetrate the helmet especially when you're using AP ammo, but the fact that helmets actually deflecting bullets is a con and something people cry about is just completely ridiculous. Go for organ shots if you see that the enemy soldiers have helmets ffs.
- Many people also complain about the fact that you can now spare the nazi bad guys and render them unconscious rather than dead. I don't even know how to comment on that. People want more ""realistic"" SE games while complaining about realistic mechanics, it's just... bruh. It's also important to note that irl covert operations during WW2 were not always about killing the nazi bad guys but most importantly about stealing documents and blueprints.",1654860945,1669141902,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Not to say it's a bad game by any means, it's just that the previous title, Sniper Elite 4, is far superior in just about every single way imaginable. From the level design, game-play, controls, and attention to detail, 5 seems like a significant downgrade from the previous game. This game honestly feels like a DLC to 4 and not a very good one at that. It doesn't do much to change up the formula, especially coming from a game that took as long as it did to come out after the 4th installment. Invasion is a cool idea, but to warrant an entirely new game to incorporate this idea is too little to late and not enough to keep my interest past a few hours of game-play. Deciding factors for me were the extremely limited weapon variety granted to the player. I'm sorry but when the first sniper rifle you get in the game is better than every rifle you could unlock after that, it not only makes the game-play feel extremely repetitive way too quickly but this doesn't encourage you to experiment and try out the other rifles. In the previous game, it felt like there were tens of rifles to choose from, each one feeling different enough to favor different play styles, but the less than 5 rifles they give you all feel exactly the same. Same goes for the secondary machine guns and the under-powered pistols, both secondary and sidearms only having a hand full of choices to choose from, again the starting weapons being the best out of the lot. But none of these complaints even hold up a candle to the biggest deciding factor in skipping out on this game and just sticking with the 4th. THIS GAME'S ENDING HAS BAR NONE AND UNDOUBTEDLY THE ABSOLUTELY WORST ENDING IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY. Far Cry 5's ending made me instantly regret the tens of ours I poured into that game and made me uninstall it before the credits reached the top of the screen but Sniper Elite 5's ending is straight up insulting. You're quite literally fixed in position and all you have to do, sorry all you can do, is shoot the lead bad guy that you've been trying to get to the entire game and the game just ends!?!?!? I'll be fare and say that the Sniper Elite franchise have never been known for their stories but this ending is the biggest missed opportunity I could possibly muster. Invasion is a small step forward, The horde mode cripples itself by having terrible maps not designed for sniping and I don't think even trying the multiplayer would be enough to overlook this game's many flaws. Long story short just stick with the 4th game. Let the 4th game be how we all remember Karl.

Effectively making the game unplayable. Has there been any progress in those six months that they've been ""urgently investigating"" the bug? Any solution in sight? Nope. They clearly don't give a shit. And that is far from the only major bug. Many of the gameplay mechanics are also very screwy or annoying, or shallow, or just simply hated nearly universally by players. They've greatly ""dumbed down"" the game and mechanics as well, apparently to appeal to a wider base, including the younger crowd. So, basically, this game is little more than shameless cash grab.

That being said, it is somewhat enjoyable, there are far more attachments for what few weapons there are (I haven't purchased the dlcs, and I have zero intention of giving these shameless lazy and greedy assholes any more of my money), though the mechanics of unlocking weapons and attachments are also screwy and somewhat obnoxious. The game has some potential, but this potential will never be reached, because Rebellion has gone the same way as most of the other big studios, and refuses to do business the proper, ethical, respectful, and hardworking way.

They’ve improved the formula in almost every way, but didn’t compromise the core identity of the game. Rebellion understands the phrase, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” and in the era of modern gaming, this is fantastic. And hey, if you’re just looking for a fun new action stealth game and haven’t touched a Sniper Elite game in your life, I highly recommend this to you too.

The core gameplay is incredibly strong. It feels well put together and satisfying to play. The game’s movement and weapon handling feels more tactile and immersive than ever before, especially with the new active reload system. The weapons feel punchy and the gunshots are very satisfying. The AI is a bit more dynamic this time around but it’s nothing to write home about, it’s stealth game AI. They can’t be perfectly smart even on the hardest difficulties or else the game wouldn’t be fun (This is why Invasion Mode is so fun. More on that later). The game also provides you with tons of different playstyles all equally viable, and with the addition of a graph summarizing your playstyle upon the end of the mission, it ups the replay value and feels fun to try different methods. If you’re a completionist, this game will give you something to chew on for a while with lots of collectibles, badges and achievements.

The actual narrative of the campaign is a bit different than other SE titles in that it actually tries to tell a bit of a story. It’s still mostly just “World War 2 people, doing World War 2 stuff.” But the characters are a little more memorable and there is a narrative that shines through. It’s not why you play the game, but it’s there. Just a way to provide reasons for why you’re playing through the missions that you are. It’s not bad, because it never tries to be good. Rebellion knows exactly what they’re trying to make and I respect that. It’s like John Wick, or Nobody. There doesn’t always need to be an incredible narrative, sometimes you can just have fun.

There are some cool gameplay features new to Sniper Elite that fit the formula pretty naturally. You can now pick up enemy weapons WITHOUT replacing what’s in your loadout, in the form of a “temporary weapon” that is dropped when empty, or unloaded manually for its ammo, meaning there’s a LOT more ammo to go around for your loadout weapons. You can now toggle between soft aim and aim down sights with any weapon, even SMGs and handguns. There’s nonlethal options now! I’m not a huge fan of the fact that sparing the nazis you’ve been sent to kill gives a huge XP bonus, I usually just wished I were able to spare one or two guys that I read about on the binoculars, not play a pacifist SOE commando behind enemy lines. But more optional gameplay styles are no skin off my back, always welcome, glad it doesn’t affect how I want to play. There’s also a more in depth customization system than Sniper Elite has ever had, with so many stats for each weapon it makes your head hurt. You can look more into the stats, or look at a simple visual summary if you don’t care. All the attachments available can start teetering on “cursed gun” territory like CoD Vanguard but nothing that’s unforgivable or COMPLETELY immersion breaking.

The multiplayer aspects of this game are cool, the deathmatch, free for all and objective modes are fun enough, they’re what you’d expect. It’s Sniper Elite but PvP. I haven’t sunk much time into these modes, but the time I have spent was very fun, it’s just not the thing I’m looking for when I boot up SE. When I do, it’s because I want fun stealth and cool killcams, but if you like the idea of sniper deathmatch, go nuts! There’s also Co-Op survival and campaign. Co-Op campaign seems a blast, I love Co-Op stealth experiences, but I don’t have any friends that play, and I haven’t felt the need to delve into Discord or Steam communities to find playmates. Survival seems to have gotten a bit of a downgrade in terms of map count and possibly map size as well, compared to SE4. It also feels much harder. Some command posts feel near impossible to defend from there just being no safe vantage points or high ground and there being way too many flank routes to viably defend against. Aside from a few QoL improvements to the survival formula, I prefer the experience of previous survival iterations more. Give us more maps, guys! Now, all other multiplayer aside, Rebellion has done something fabulous with this one:

There is now, of course, Invasion mode. Invade a player’s campaign mission and hunt them down as an Axis Sniper. That is so damn cool. It’s like the sniper boss fight in Metal Gear Solid, at its best. A tense matchup of two equals, a dangerous game of cat and mouse. At its worst, it’s a game of chicken where the other player finds your approximate location, and bum-rushes you with an SMG. But even then, it’s over quickly and you can get back to finding a good matchup! It’s usually an incredibly fun experience. I can’t figure out which side I like to play more. This may be my favorite mode. I’ve gotten over 100 kills now as the invader and something over two dozen kills as the invaded. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages. I highly recommend the campaign with Invasion on. Getting invaded by a thinking enemy when you’d otherwise breeze through the mission of hapless minions immediately changes the tone to something much more intense. Especially when that enemy can put on the exact same uniform as any other NPC and walk around slowly in a group with them, blending in near perfectly (This is still my favorite way to play as the Jaeger, even with the ghillie suit an option for me now).

Last but certainly not least is killcams. ALL weapons now feature killcams. Handguns, rifles and SMGs. It’s cool, I always wanted the option for other guns to have them. Cool cinematic trickshots shouldn’t be limited to just rifles! And like SE4, melee kills, traps and explosions all feature killcams now as well. There is so much more detail in the X-Ray models it’s almost too much, to the point of taking away from other details. It’s certainly gross and seems anatomically correct, but do I need to see like, the salivary glands in the jaw? It obscures the destruction physics on the bones! I digress. The boring, repetitive organ shots of SE4 have been improved. It used to be that any time there was a fatal shot on an organ, say a liver, that it would BLUR OUT all the other amazingly detailed layers (muscle, bone, etc.) and just focus on a hi-def render of a floating liver getting split in half, the same way, every time. But they’ve done away with this now! The frequency of this has been decreased, and the organs all dynamically respond to the caliber of the bullet that hit, and the direction it hit from. There are also bullet hole effects on enemies now, making X-Ray free killcams very brutal, and still immersive. Used to be that the ai would make a ridiculous face as a floating bullet phased through their nose, with no blood in sight. But no more! It’s a little lazy, just adding a generic blood spat on the exit wound. But when it covers a textured part of the body like the eye socket, it really looks like you blew the dude’s face off. When the blood effect is just pasted onto a flat surface, like the bald head of an enemy, or a torso, it looks pretty boring. And why oh why aren’t there destruction physics on the character models themselves? There’s a beautifully dynamic, fully destructible skeletal system, but if I blow a jaw off in the X-Ray, the guy’s chin is beautifully intact!! Anyway, the killcams have also been improved in every single way, I’m just nitpicking.

In summary this game MIGHT be the best in the franchise but I'd have to replay all to be 100% sure. Like I said, I recommend it to Sniper Elite veterans, shooter fans, and stealth game fans. Definitely a hard cop, maybe even get the DLC too.

And now I feel like I must give my opinion on this game, This game although several months old is still quite buggy with every update, but I feel it getting better. I frequent the Rebellion Discord and have submitted numerous ideas and suggestions, the Community Manager has been very kind to members of the discord giving bug reports often asking for more information or placing a support ticket, and has extended gratitude to those helping and has also passed on a lot of information to the development team.

I grew up watching my parents play Sniper Elite v2 and 3 and now I finally get to experience the launch of the franchise that I have watched for almost a decade now I have loved almost every moment of it in the campaign from learning the enemies patrol patterns and dialogue locations so much that I have practically memorized a vast majority of them. The Multiplayer I feel is rather lackluster however, the poor XP gain and frequent vote kicks from matches have pretty much ruined my prospects in multiplayer along with few maps and rather repetitive game modes. The DLC content missions and weapons are all rather great with the replayability of every single mission with all the different approaches and tactics that are involved especially with loadouts, special ammo, and Authentic mode. Gathering the medals has been a blast also trying to figure it all out.

There are a few negatives to the game I will also like to address

The lack of weaponry.
Now of course I understand that the new attachment system almost makes up for this but I just feel like the current amount of weapons is minuscule compared to Sniper Elite 4 which when I was younger had fun mastering each weapon and each weapon is the same if you think of the trade-offs 

Challenges
The challenges in this game are rather terrible and repetitive what I loved about the mastery challenges for SE4 was the skill and timing it took to get each challenge each weapon required a different set of kill challenges to complete now you just load level 3 up and after an hour or so have every rifle mastered

Axis Invasion
Now I love Dark Souls and this greatly reminds me of the invasion concept from that franchise yet it just becomes boring either being invaded by a player who hasn't bothered with the campaign or invading a level 1 player. I love the few times I get into a game with an experienced player and have to actively work to get the upper hand and try to outsmart the enemy for instance I have an axis invader I got added me on steam due to how much fun we had taking each other down I want more of that not invading a fresh player with little understanding of the mechanics of the game.

I will try to add more to this review in the near future if I remember in the meantime

Besides the game length I am having a problem in co-op,  With my partner as the host, it is common for the weapon I am using to start reloading and it doesn't always stop with a weapon change.  And if I've been shot  down, the gun I use to shoot a nearby enemy is useless since it keeps reloading and won't shoot.  This inevitability results in a failed mission and restart to a save point.  The host doesn't have this problem and I don't in the solo game.  If Rebelliom corrects this error then I will opt for DLC.

Not sure how much I like the new features in this game, but I still like it overall. Now for what I am not sure I like...

The bigger maps are nice, but frustrating at the same time. There is too much, for my liking, herding you into corridors to force combat. In fact I dislike this enough that I am almost at the point of saying it breaks the stealth dynamic. I will say that stealth does not, ""Feel"", as satisfying in this release. Perhaps it is the design choices they made to include all the multi player options, (I do not play multiplayer). Also there seems to be issues with enemy infantry swarming you in this game. Maybe it is the bigger maps with more targets and enemy infantry... I find that it is really frustrating at times when you are, ""Found"", or, ""Seen"", and then 10, 20 or even more infantry spam your location. Frustrating and not fun. Other times no one is around and you sneak long distances for seemingly no reason. Like I said- stealth needs work in my opinion.

Zip lines, weapon workbenches, skill points and anything else that is not part of the core game play experience are more or less meaningless in this game, (Like they were in the 4th game). They do make SOME difference I suppose; but they are not worth considering part of what makes this game good or not.

I am 64 and am NOT a shooter game player with reflexes like superman so the difficulty settings are welcome, and work well enough.

Overall I am happy with this game... mostly. Hopefully they fix the mission 4 bug so I can continue the campaign. Stuck there because the game will not progress, (Others have had this issue apparently). If they patch it in good time I can excuse these things though.

Bottom line: My message to the Dev's: Stick to the core game play that makes this a good game that people want to play and make more maps, (Longer campaign). And PLEASE- fix the stealth so that it works as well as the 4th game. After all, stealth is the core of this franchise.

8 out of 10, (6.5 out of 10 with the expectation that it will improve).

Now played an additional 68 hours of this game:

After really getting used to the game system I must say that I have reiterate that stealth is just not as good in this game as the previous game. I likely will not play this game very much at all any more. I am at the point where I can only stand a little bit of it at a time... Just not as fun as the last one. Why you ask...? Mostly it is just very frustrating to be forced into melee action way more than I want to and just too much forcing me into actions and places that do not fit my play style.

My final score is 7 out of 10, (Largely because it screwed the solo players to enable all the multi player stuff- and I do not play multiplayer).

It also has incredibly detailed guns, vehicles, and uniforms if that's your thing. The weapons are also the most customizable they've ever been, with modifications being able to completely change how the same weapon operates.

Zombie Army 4 was a great zombie/close combat game.
Sniper Elite 5 is awful, because it uses mostly the close combat mechanics of ZA4 in a sniper game.  Close combat should be very difficult and dangerous, like it was in SE4.  Instead, it is the best way to handle most of SE5, you can leave your rifle at home.  When critical sniper shots are required, the game kindly provides you with one of several very powerful sniper rifles.  Once that's done, feel free to return to using SMGs and pistols.
Swing and a miss.  Rename this as something else, don't call it Sniper anything.

The fact that the latest DLC pack is called ""Up Close and Personal"" ironically underlines the problem with the overall design of the game.  Not a ""sniper"" game, it's an ""up close and personal"" fighting game.",1667096868,1667097007,False,6,0,0.5256386399269104,0,True,False,False

I had high expectations for the successor to SE4. I was hoping for unchanged controls and the same usable items. I was disappointed. Meaningful items from SE4 were exchanged for meaningless items (keyword: stun mines). The maps are way too big in my opinion. A ""times just"" play through is not possible. It takes hours. New maps (DLCs) often have around 30GB. Per piece. In addition, the new and completely nonsensical possibility to enter a PvE game of another game and hunt him ...

I would advise everyone to SE4. The maps are varied, the usable items make sense and the controls are intuitive.

Ich hatte hohe Erwartungen an den Nachfolger von SE4. Ich habe auf eine unveränderte Steuerung und die gleichen nutzbaren Gegenstände gehofft. Ich wurde enttäuscht. Sinnvolle Gegenstände aus SE4 wurden gegen sinnlose Gegenstände ausgetauscht (Stichwort Betäubungsminen). Die Karten sind meiner Meinung nach viel zu groß. Ein ""mal eben"" durchspielen ist nicht möglich. Es dauert Stunden. Neue Karten (DLCs) haben gerne mal um die 30GB. Pro Stück. Dazu die neue und völlig unsinnige Möglichkeit in ein PvE-Spiel eines anderen Spiel einzusteigen und ihn zu jagen ...

Ich würde jedem zu SE4 raten. Die Karten sind abwechslungsreich, die nutzbaren Gegenstände machen Sinn und die Steuerung ist eingängig.

I went in with hardly any expectations, and would've been less disappointed if they went with another reskin of a previous game. There are many issues I have with the game, but the worst offenders are as follows:

- Overpriced DLC for very little content that is still locked behind silly requirements
- Lazily tacked on features and game modes that are unbalanced and generally unfun (mainly Invasion) to supplement very little base game content
- Braindead easy to predict AI even on the hardest difficulties
- Unsatifying ""loud"" gameplay with most secondary weapons feeling very samey
-  ""Open World"" maps with very bizarre and nonsensical invisible walls

There are many more issues, but much like Rebellion, I would rather not put more effort into this than necessary. The game looks and feels much less complete than it's predecessors and is a testament to how far Rebellion has fallen as a company, as it seems to be much more of a cash grab than a genuine attempt at a game. I can only hope that the game gets much more base game content and has many of it's issues fixed within the coming months, but as Rebellion seems to be a lot more interested in adding more and more overpriced DLC, such as a $15 DLC for a whopping two guns and a weapon skin that's uglier than cat barf, I sincerely doubt it will happen any time soon.",1666531197,1666531197,False,5,0,0.536516845226287842,0,True,False,False

SE5 is highly immersive. The enemies feel real especially when outside of buildings. Shooting feels real. Enemies will ""pincer"" you if you are not careful, or even come up from behind you.  (Inside of buildings they are less immersive).

One thing I love about this game is how highly detailed the difficulty settings can be, so you can tailor the game to your liking.   You can reach into the difficulty settings and do an amazing amount of customization.  Many games  offer ""play it your way"". This one delivers. 

Many people have commented that the open world has artificial barriers, such as a stone wall you can't climb over. And they are correct.  I originally thought these we programming limitations. And they sometimes feel like that.  But having played the game now for some hours I see (many) of these limitations as actually the dev's way to shape the level, to make the areas you can go more exciting.  It works for the most part, but running against one of these limitations during a heated battle can be frustrating.  So it's not a perfect system. Still, the battles feel real, and that's a pretty good thing.

There are many things the game shines in. ""Sound masking"" where you try to shoot when there is noise. You can of course sabotage generators and vehicles to making backfiring noise, but you can also shoot when a loud airplane flys by. It takes a while to learn the ins and outs of noise masking (for example, you have about 4 seconds to shoot after a generator/vehicle backfire) but when you do fully understand how it works your game enjoyment will increase a lot.

I love the weapon upgrades, but do find the ""workbench system"" somewhat contrived.  I wish physically finding them in the game world was more straight forward. There are 3 workbenches per mission but you don't know where they all are. Further, each workbench specializies in one of three weapon types - rifle, pistol, smg.  But they physically look identical. Everything I've read from veteran SE plays says this is an improvement from past SE games... but I say they still need more work. To me, they should not be so difficult to access. But maybe it's just me...

As for story, it's enough. If you're looking for a Far Cry 6 level story it's not here, but what is here is enough to make you feel like you're in a WWII saga.  It's not bad, and I oppose some of the reviews that really trash it. It's enough, it draws you in, tells you the background and details, and gets you to killing Nazis quickly.

I play single player and coop with a friend.  Both are fun in their own ways.

I wanted to mention the bullet cam system.  You can set it in preferences to show the carnage with almost every shot. New players might do that for the novelty, but at least for me, I turn mine down to very low so it only shows them only once in a while. Otherwise, the flow of combat is disrupted in my opinion.  But seeing it once in a while is like salt to food. Gives it flavor.

I also want to mention the non-lethal takedown and ammo abilities.  It's probably my bias, but I like that. I like to have the option to spare a life yet accomplish my mission.  Other's may not feel this way; I do.

As I write this, Russia and Ukraine are at war; Putin is dropping hints of nukes. The world is baking in heat; and half the people in the US just want to stick their heads in the sand. We have a wannabee US dictator in the news everyday.  But SE 5 allows me to go to a different place and time,  get immersed in being the hero of that world, and forget about the realities of what is happening today. And frankly, I am thankful for that.

- Better graphic
- Have weapon customization
- Challenging invasion
Cons
- More update, more bugs following
- Cranky character's traversal and movements i.e. running in narrow path can make your character spin for some reason; delayed throwable items (really annoying)
- Focus on MP (Including invasion) too much over SP
- Yeah .. highly focus on MP but no dedicated server and the server is very slow and crashes a lot, especially the latest update (Please see the date of posting the review)
- Few maps to play in MP and have copy and paste maps from SP to MP
- Lacked of variety on enemies ... just infantry (no spotter found in SP), jager and officer
- The old dev team are gone. This game series will never be the same again.

My conclusion:
In term of ...
Gameplay: 5/10
Graphic: 8/10 (Better than SE4)
Story/Plot: 3/10 (SE4 is better)
DLCs: 4/10 (Price is ripped off and take ages to drop)

It's not great as a SE title, but it's a solid offbrand Hitman. It's actually pretty easy but the first level is hot garbage. The follow on levels are better.

Original Review: SE3 took the series away from being a stealth shooter to be more action based. SE4 expanded and improved upon that experience and provided an excellent blend of sniping and run-n-gun action with multiple ways to play a fairly open map.

SE5 is not that. It is a 3rd person action shooter with some sniper themes. Like an old 3rd person action shooter from the 2000s the levels are lane base and you don't have the freedom of movement of the previous two installments. On the subject of movement, Karl's movements just seem a little off. It's hard to describe but movement is both too fast and too slow while also being overly sensitive in some aspects. My biggest pet peeve is ladders and dropping down a ledge. Karl has a tendency to run past the ladder then dangle off the ledge before deciding to climb back up. He's very sensitive to understanding there is a ledge to hang off of, but not at all sensitive to the ladder he should be using to go up.

Dialogue in the Sniper Elite series has never been something to write home about, but this entry changes it. It really inspires you to get out your best fountain pen and practice your finest calligraphy to send a strongly worded letter over to Rebellion to tell them it sucks. It's like they tried to put effort into the story dialogue, but when you are making a B movie less is more. In this case, less certainly would have been more.

I'm going to skip over Invasion mode because I just turned it off. Not my cup of tea, thank you very much.

There are some things I very much like about SE5 though. Iron sights and kill cams for pistols and smgs. Also, enemies now only carry one long arm (if you remember in SE4 most of them were walking around with a sniper rifle and a smg), so at least the enemy has a reasonable weapons loadout compared to SE4. That's about it really.

As long as you are looking for a 3rd person action shooter where you get to run down your set lanes and kill everyone in your path, then you probably will be happy with SE5. But SE4 is just better and costs less. So why not just get SE4 and be on with your day?",1653770455,1665160464,True,0,0,0.508610725402832031,0,True,False,False

Pros: [b]#1.[/b] Has everything that Sniper Elite 4 had (but with 300% more bugs)
[b]#2.[/b] Loading and saving a save is very fast (under 7seconds).

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] Infected with Denuvo malware, which prevented me from playing the game on multiple occasions
[b]#2.[/b] The game crashed 3 times in 2hours.
[b]#3.[/b] The game has a huge memory leak, which reduces fps to 15 or so. Once you restart the game, then the performance is normal again. It's very likely that Denuvo malware is the cause.
[b]#4.[/b] Has many bugs. Sometimes the enemies INSTANTLY spot you and open fire, even if you're sneaking. Sometimes you get stuck and can't get unstuck.
[b]#5.[/b] Has Day-One DLC. The practice of developers making content and then separating it from the game that you just paid $50 for and then expecting you to pay for that removed content on Day-One is a disgusting one. Rebellion are scum for releasing such a buggy game AND then having the gall to charge for content that they removed from the game, instead of having rather spent that time just fixing bugs.
[b]#6.[/b] The regional pricing of this game is terrible. This game costs 42USD in Argentina, which is one of the poorest countries on earth. Rebellion KNOW that they've priced the game way, way too high in certain countries due to the hundreds of players from those countries that have commented on the situation in the steam forums, and yet after more than a month, Rebellion haven't changed it (and won't).
[b]#7.[/b] The game is highly linear. There are bushes & invisible walls absolutely everywhere, that prevent you from approaching an objective from multiple angles. It's literally the devs' way, or the highway. This means there's no room for inventiveness when taking on an objective. If the devs want you to enter through the front gate of a camp, then you can ONLY do that, there's no side routes or inventiveness to be found.
[b]#8.[/b] You can't jump over a massive amount of stuff, which you'd normally expect you'd be able to. I'm talking about knee-high stuff, that you can even jump over.
[b]#9.[/b] The animations are borked. Multiple times now, I've choked a guy out, except that the animation shows me choking out his mid-section rofl.
[b]#10.[/b] There's basically NO choice when it comes to weapons at the start. ALL weapons are unlocked on different missions, and you only get to choose from 2 weapons until then.
[b]#11.[/b] You aren't given any information about how much experience you gained at the end of the mission, or how much experience various objectives give you.
[b]#12.[/b] You can shoot a guy in the head with a weapon, and he won't die. In a game that claims to be realistic, you shouldn't have to shoot a guy 3 times in the face before they die (I'm not talking about bosses, I'm talking about regular freaking soldiers)

In summation: If you're looking for a good sniping game, then get one of the Sniper Ghost Warrior games, or even just challenge yourself by playing through the entire Borderlands 2/3 game with only sniper rifles... you'll have a lot more fun and you won't be giving Rebellion any more money to make an EVEN WORSE Sniper Elite 6 game, which is a win-win. Oh, and I'm refunding this buggy malware-infested dog water.

I personally have not had an issue with the game play, so I guess they have fixed the problems other players were having.  I have played every Sniper Elite game since the beginning and have enjoyed this as much as the the others. There is a axis attack mode that you can allow in your game play, I didn't even know what that was until a player requested a rematch.  Basically other players can enter your game while your playing and try to take you out, kind of a cool idea.  9 maps with lots of enemies and challenges along the way,  each map has 19 items you need to find and some are in very odd places. I have only found all 19 on 1 map so there is a challenge in that aspect of the game. I found the game to be fun and entertaining and the graphics have come a long way, much better than some of the games coming out today.

This is not just another sniper simulator.
It’s like hitman, meets metal gear solid. I say metal gear solid 5 cause, your put into a sand box world and choose your load out.

You have collectables / weapons / contracts an more to do….

Each particular contract, they want it carried out in a certain way, if you do this, your rewarded more so.

Skills is another nice add to the game, though nothing too exciting.

Many guns and attachments, 8 attachments per gun, each slot has 5 different variants of attachment, 5 muzzles , scopes etc.

Ranking system and goal system….

The authentic difficulty is great, but…..getting those long shots is basically luck. Taking into wind and bullet drop…..is impossible just about. But I am new.

From knife pistol machine gun, and your rifle, your rewarded for certain kills, and even where your bullets hit, e.g eye socket, or lungs.

They implemented a less then lethal approach, but ….we play this cuz we wanna shwack cunts.

only thing that bugs me, is there’s so many obstacles or fences you should be able climb or get through and can’t, which has gotten me killed many times, cuz I thought “ hey I’ll just jump up or over this fence….and you can..and the game feels like it really try’s to push you into a fire fight, which can be avoided.

Apart from that said totally worth it, if you like hitman, sniping , and having an open world to carry out your mission you see fit then, this is it.

Worth full price, stay away from season pass for now.

It's refreshing to play a shooter that isn't oriented around battle royale modes and is instead focused on the ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE AVERAGE PLAYER.  ANYONE can pick up this game and enjoy playing it, which is a stark contrast to all the 'competitive shooters' like Apex Legends, Fortnite, and Warzone where only a tenth of a lobby stands a fair chance at winning, and four percent actually win any given match... these kind of games are 'dopamine traps.'  In order to enjoy your time playing these games you have to be within the top ten percent of all players or else you will just get killed over and over again by players who are sadder and sweatier than you, players who can find and properly get shots off at your head before you can even get your cursor on their avataar..... This game doesn't have any of that 'competitive shooter' bullshit.  You can kick back and play a story driven game if that's what you're into.  If you want a challenge, you can turn on expert mode and actually have to account for wind, bullet drop, and noise concealment against groups of enemies who tactically clear areas and can tell where your shots come from.  Still not hard enough?... turn on invasion, and then there will be a real human sniper trying to take out you and your homie out as you try to complete your objectives.  You will never get a depressed 14 year old rage-a-holic calling you trash just because you're not within the top ten percent of players and made him lose.  You will not get spawn killed over and over again with no clear objective in mind other than getting good at the game to make noobs feel insecure the same way you were made to feel insecure about your useless ability to virtually clear a room.  What you will find is a compelling narrative with clear, obtainable objectives, and gameplay that is diverse and interesting enough that getting to the end of the story doesn't feel like a grind.  This is one of the few shooter campaigns I have actually replayed, and the addition of a pvp campaign helps to add even more replayability and depth.  This is a great game, and they have handled multiplayer in a mature way by providing a challenging experience that is actually fun for the user, instead of the standard ego cesspool that usually occurs in multiplayer shooter games.  Give your nervous system a break, stop playing battle royales that are literally designed to use your own psychology against you to make profit for the devs with NO concern for the quality of the product that they sell, and come play a game that WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO BE FUN, THAT WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO BE A GAME AND NOT A WAY TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.",1663520714,1663520714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all gripes I have with this is that AI in this one feel a lot more dumb down than SE4, I've only played until mission 4 that's when I lost the interest in the game despite having all these new gun customizations mechanic.

Secondly, the level design. Sure that it feels so vast and with all the area to explore but comparing to SE4 it felt like instead of making it more fun with all the tactical choices I had on hand, it's just makes the game only a bit longer even with the AI road traffic which comes and goes for example in mission 2. Each of SE4 missions setting plays well despite some of the map have a lot more linear paths and even the short (or long depending on how you play it) H assassination mission for SE4 is more fun than 4 missions I played in SE5 so far. 

The Coop was not as fun as SE4 despite playing with the same friend who we had both enjoyed the previous game.

As of now the DLCs, I could say it's even worse than SE4 with all the things they added into the games whether it's the weapons or the recently released ghillies. I understand that they're trying to sell the cosmetic for specific character but in terms of look (which is very subjective) , it's worse than SE4.

Overall, I would recommend you to buy SE4 instead of 5. SE 5 might make a good impression to you who just came to play SE for the first time but the first SE and following sequel up to SE4, SE5 is probably the worst so far in my opinion. If you want to play it I highly recommends for you to wait for the game to be on sales and would be even better if you wait for them to get their act together.",1663435352,1663435352,False,4,0,0.490275859832763672,0,True,False,False

     This game's story takes itself too serious and the gameplay is lacking. There are very little good sniping positions, sight lines, and sniper possibilities. It has specific positions which encourage sniping by providing an obvious vantage point and scoped rifles......OVERLOOKING TRASH and like 5 AI. Because of the ""realistic map design,"" the game forces you into their bad stealth.....CLOSE RANGE combat, in a SNIPING GAME, because the maps are near claustrophobic. A few maps are a bit more open and include a few open fields with bushes at every angle blocking your views. To top it all off, DLC suck as of the time of this review...so I either didn't buy them or returned them.

     The new DLC maps they added have the same problem as all the base game maps with much of it being indoors or narrow tunnels. And the gun and skin packs are just a waste of money for dumb looking skins and useless weaker reused guns from the other games which you need to unlock the attachments for through challenges.

     The invasion mode however, is golden. The only reason I would recommend buying this game is if you're interested in hunting down players. The invasion mode is the only thing I play on this game anymore. Using your map knowledge to track down the Allied sniper with the AI's locations, the completed objectives, and the sound cues which the sniper might cause is extremely fun and satisfying. Then once you find them you get to land the classic Sniper Elite cinematic X-Ray kill or get into a sniper battle with you flanking to a new position. It's thrilling.... but has some flaws. Many games end with the Allied sniper getting killed by the AI before you get close and ending the match as a victory (witch doesn't count as a kill for you in order to unlock items) or, they finish the level as soon as you spawn. The Victories and losses aren't tracked at all actually; only your direct kills on the sniper are counted and tracked. But you get nothing past the 100 ghillie suit other than a number going up. Even still, the invasion mode is FUN and by far the best part of this game. If this game mode were to be split off into its own game somehow, I'd only buy that and ignore the rest of this game.

     Unfortunately, even the standard multiplayer modes are kind of lacking. It's exactly what you'd expect from a third person perspective game based around sniping.... people camping in one spot for much of the match and using third person to peep over walls. I know some people like it but I find it boring. 

     That's all I've got to say about this game, hope it helps you....",1663287438,1663288038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game gets extremely repetitive very quickly. You do the same thing over and over on every map and they do not get more difficult. They actually just get easier considering you get extremely op weapon upgrades, such as your pistol getting a SCOPE on it, making stealth completely laughably easy. It was better in older sniper elite games where you had a really bad stealth pistol, it made stealthing harder and funnier. 

There's also very little sniping for a game called sniper elite.

Too many games lately trying to compete with another game they feel is their competition(I'm looking at you Battlefield), and lose what made the game great by adding features of another game. The campaign seems to be well varied with both close and long range encounters, and plenty of traversal options. If you go loud the game punishes the player with smarter AI than previous games. They will spread out and flank, fall back and alert others, use suppressing fire when the player is not in direct line of sight, and much more. The Axis invasion idea was brilliant(an option you can turn on or off to allow players to invade your campaign). It is also well implemented well with a good balance for both sides(and a camping detector thank God!). However I have to go back on a little bit of what i said in the beginning. I'm honestly not sure if its trying to compete with Ghost Warrior, or just pandering to the ones who want a watered down experience. Suppressors are EVERYWHERE! One would think you could walk into your local hardware store and buy one. I've been playing since the first game, and there was so much more of an authentic challenge back then. Suppressed pistols are available from mission 2, and suppressed rifles by mission 3. The weapon attachments and their provided ""upgrades"" are simply comical. We are not to Tarkov levels of customization or anything, but hardly any of it is WWII period. I guess this could be chalked up to an alternate universe as we have killed Hilter in plenty of places and times. Still way over the top for WWII and a bit too much. Simplicity here is best imo. Different guns is fine, but when your putting a 6x scope, suppressor and a shoulder stock on a 1911 a line has been crossed. Now that we have the campaign out of the way lets get into multiplayer. Lets also get the disclaimers out of the way. I am a fan of hardcore(no glint, no aim assist, no empty lung zoom, ect) no cross. My opinions here are going to reflect my game play experiences on this game mode specifically. There has been a lot more work put into the framework of multiplayer compared to 4. This title seems primed to grow into a more successful multiplayer than previous titles. However there's only 2 maps.... 2. there's 4 total i believe, but only 2 for no cross. Might as well be 1 though since omg the beach map is trash. The team on the beach has NO cover. While the other side gets trenches, bunkers and plenty of options to move around the map without being seen. The beach side is just screwed. This is also a pretty small map as well. The other map is built much better. 1 side is a little more open, but you can navigate the map mostly in stealth if you traverse the buildings in the back. A little annoying, but if your not going to be patient in a sniper game why are you here lol?? Now my biggest complaint has to be the Assassins Creed style of movement. You character will literally do that annoying thing from AC where if you run up to a wall you cant climb you just run 2 steps up and jump back down killing all your momentum. Its rare, but stupid annoying when it happens. There is no button to hug the wall so the game decides when you use the wall for cover. Let me tell you this happens at the worst times. You're wanting to go around a corner, and your guy just keeps bouncing from one side of the corner to the other. Just like AC I feel this game has severe movement lag. I constantly find myself correcting my characters movements from doing something dumb and its always 1 step behind what I'm doing, and that's how you end up sticking to both sides of a corner 4 times in a row while your trying to make a break for it. It can also be a problem when your trying to hide on a box in a hall from a player. Its hard to get the character to do what you want it to do to prevent your gun from sticking out and blowing your cover. This would be so easy to fix with a simple button command. If this wasn't bad enough the game will change your characters stance on uneven terrain. Almost the entire game is uneven terrain! If the game decides your character cant ""fit"" into the area your trying to crawl to your character will go from prone to crouch or stand in rare cases with no warning. In a sniper game and in a multiplayer setting this is simply unacceptable as it stands. I'd rather have my character not move than be a whack a mole. Again we get into the laggy movement. I'll often times find myself panicking and pressing the button again since my character didnt do anything quickly and now he will be standing and crouching a couple times before going prone again. Also prone movement is not great. Objects like a curb will prevent the player from going sideways over it(sure it wont be comfortable, but very doable). This is a SNIPER game. If you cant navigate properly while prone something is very wrong. All my complaints aside this is a good game that has the potential to be a better game than it currently is.",1653811164,1663180781,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I love this series and the Zombie Army spin-offs too, the developers have really out-done themselves this time though. Sniper Elite 5 is fantastic and the addition of the Axis Invasion multiplayer mode was another master stroke just like the x-ray kill cams were in Sniper Elite V2. This series just keeps getting better because of innovation and a high level of quality game design.

The weapon customization, level design, collectables the whole damn game is so well made and presented. The sniping gameplay has always been great in this series while the slow-mo x-ray kill-cams never get old. These x-ray kill-cams were and still are a f@cking genius idea, which other developers have tried to copy, in other games but nobody does it like the Sniper Elite team.

How surreal and bad-ass is it to have a super realistic and detailed recreation of the second world war. With these crazy surreal kill-cam moments and evil b@stard Nazis runnin’ amok, it’s just a really enjoyable combination of elements. Karl Fairburne is also a classic American hero character and the assassinate Hitler levels are just the cherry on top of the awesome video game cake. I love this game and it has quickly become one of my all time favorites.

Fourth: The most worrying for me. The business model. The fact that this studio is selling weapons like the P.1938, maps, skins and missions on micro dlc's is insulting and sad. Yes, they have the season pass, but it's just to justify their aggressive commercial behavior towards their customers.

Now there are four.  Would like another one that might be similar to Facility in SE4.   The campaign maps are great, Spy Game I think it is, is a sniper's dream.  You can tag and snipe about fifty 300 to 500m rifle head shots without even breaking cover or crossing the beach to the big town that is your objective.  I tagged one on the map high in the right of the screen for a 534M headshot.   You can tag victims after barely moving two steps from your spawn point.   Like 15 or 20 head shots possible over 400M.   50 is enough to unlock the Gilley skin for your favorite rifle.  I farmed Gilleys for all the rifles in this mission and this unlocked the Master of all Rifles Medal.  Any additional rifles obtained through DLC are not required to be mastered for this Medal.
 There is not a great deal new here with SE5.  I haven't looked at the ""Invasion"" aspect of the game and haven't played as the Axis so I can't evaluate that.  It just looked fairly lame by the description.   I don't want to play as a despicable Nazi anyways. Perhaps the developers misunderstood the sentiment against that regime by Americans and other groups.  I don't want my character in that uniform.   And I don't want anyone ""invading"" my Single Player campaign.  It's hard enough on the harder levels with enemies sneaking up behind me and machine gunning me in the back.  I like Campaign and especially co-op.  Co-op for me is the strength of the game.  I don't like much of the multi-player.  MP in SE4 seemed dumb or contrived to me.  You were either crawling around getting shot all the time or running around getting shot all the time.  I can get through entire Survival Waves without being even wounded on Authentic Mode and get the most kills on a 3-player Co-op Team.  By skillfully utilizing cover I've gotten the ""Untouchable"" ribbon many, many times in Co Op.    But I play Multi-Player free for all type modes and I'm getting killed like every 60 seconds.   Playing Urban Map Free For All in SE4?  The rapid carnage was ridiculous.  Somebody went down about every five seconds.   Funny at first, but quickly makes you dizzy.   If you stop moving, you're dead because everybody is moving.  That gets really tiresome after awhile.  Your vision becomes a blur.  But that's the nature of MP.  Everybody gets killed over and over again unless you're hiding in cover.  And if you hide in cover, you can only get trap kills.  Even the best players and the best shots get killed constantly in many games.  Like GTA5 when people kill each other over and over again and it flashes on the screen.  Stupid.   I'm making a $2 million delivery and they're farming PVP kills.  In just about every game I play I couldn't care less about experience points unless it unlocks something.  Then I'll utilize clever ways to farm them and unlock a weapon or something.  But there are easier ways than a circular firing squad.",1663102046,1663102046,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a definite step down from Sniper Elite 4, probably because the same maps are used in multiplayer matches and they removed the advantages so people wouldn't whine.

They have a huge amount of replayability thanks to the different spawn points and the ""authentic"" difficulty, which requires you to know level inside and out.


But let me rant a bit about the poorly designed invasion mechanic.
It is horribly unbalanced and the end game is just the host spamming [strike]focus mode[/strike] wall hack with the invader having little to no chance.

The invader has a lot of fun ways of finding out where the host is, like following the bodies, paying attention to the objectives and asking NPCs. Problem is, when you find him, you get rewarded by getting preshot and killed because, again, the host has [strike]focus mode[/strike] wall hack.

As a fix I would suggest that focus mode should not apply to players who are sneaking or standing still. This way, experienced players are on equal footing when they are facing off in close quarters.


Anyway, just play offline. It's an incredible Single Player game.

1. Singleplayer: 
- Story is cheese and/or meh.
- Gameplay is fairly standard 3rd person cover shooter.
- The ""x-ray"" stuff is AMAZING!
- The guns and customization is alright. Wish it had more.
- Map and mission layout is ok. Just wish we had WAY MORE, but I understand that it's not easy to craft them.

2. Multiplayer: 
- The co-op mode is co-op so it's as expected and it works. 
- The horde survival mode is like every other horde survival mode. Just wish it was more complex or expansive. Note: this seems to have some bugs.
- The ""normal"" PVP multiplayer is like every other 3rd person shooter multiplayer game. Very standard and IMO might have been a waste of development time/resources.

3. The Best Part:
- Invasion mode is by far the best multiplayer experience this game has to offer especially when paired with co-op play.
- Basically Dark Souls, but with guns.
- Basically Bloodborne, but more pew pew.
- If you've never shot a Bambi Karl before then have you truly ever lived? This is the real question posed by Invasion mode.
- No seriously Invasion mode is the best thing outside of shooting Nazi ball sacks. Developers take note of this if nothing else please!

I will try to abstain to it, but I will most likely drop some minor spoilers of this game's story. As B movie as Sniper Elite tends to be, some people might not like it being spoiled. You have been warned.

If you want me to substantiate what I say in this review: I have played all Sniper Elite games except the first, never touched Nazi Zombie Army but watched full playthroughs of most of them.


TL;DR: This plays almost like a side-grade to 4, its actually quite fun once you get used to it, but it feels like a ""Megaman Zero 4"" effect where things were changed solely for the purpose of making the game feel different to 4.

Sniper Elite 5 is certainly one of the more divisive titles in the series history, and that's even with Nazi Zombie Army and the whole Epic Games fiasco that happened a while ago. I can see why it does have a somewhat mixed reputation from most of the longtime players of the series, regardless there is some merit to be found in many aspects the game offers.

Gameplay at its core is still Sniper Elite, you have 3 weapons, an assortment of traps and distraction tools, and your goal is to move through the expansive maps to complete your missions and any side missions you encounter along the way, while also finding the best spots to pick people off from long range. The real difference lies in the nuances and subtle changes to the formula that make it stand differently from its predecessor. 

There is a level of weapon freedom much more pronounced in 5 than other previous entries. Newly added Weapon customization allows you to kit out all 3 of your weapons to your heart's content, provided you have parts unlocked. You can make the loudest, most powerful rifle imaginable, or you can sacrifice performance for stealth with the addition of a variety of suppressors, some quieter than others. This system makes every single weapon a worthwhile investment, and makes loadouts more interesting as a whole. Want to snipe with a pistol? You can do that. Want to create a stealthy, near absolutely silent SMG? You can do that. Want to go full German and run around with a scopeless Kar98? You can do that. Unfortunately, this same system also dilutes the identity of what makes Sniper Elite . . . well . . . Sniper Elite. It somewhat removes the purpose of the Rifle if you can simply kit out an SMG or a pistol with a silencer and a scope, and often times the Rifle is much, *much* louder than both unless you have suppressors only found in the later portions of the game. Given that there is also a strange closeness to this game that I will elaborate on later, this can make it feel more like you're playing ""Commando Elite"" instead of ""Sniper Elite"".

You can also select what kind of bullets to use in your weapon, carrying up to two extra types for each weapon in addition to the standard ammo for general use. Each serves a purpose in-game, AP can destroy locks and damage vehicles quicker, Non-Lethal allows you to knock out soldiers for extra XP, Subsonic makes your gunshots significantly quieter, you get the idea. As novel of a concept this is, it generally doesn't have much of a use outside of making things slightly more convenient to do for the player. It almost, *almost* feels like a tacked on, slightly more expanded concept of suppressed ammo from the last game.

Weapon choice and Enemy Choice feels a little lackluster in my opinion, I like what is there but there could be so much more. Referencing Sniper Elite 4, there were quite a few Italian weapons to better represent that ""You're in Italy, go fight the pizzapasta people and their German friends."" I don't see that as much in this one, both in terms of Weapons and Enemies. There are a grand total of 2 french weapons you can use: The RSC 1917, and the Model D. Where is the MAS-36? Where is the MAS-38? MAS-44? Berthiers? Lebels? Where the fuck is Vichy even? I was expecting at least a few French turncoats to plink at. Instead its all Germans [spoiler] and some Japanese later on.[/spoiler] Its not the biggest deal, but it just feels bizarre to have so few weapons from the theater you're in. Maybe its future DLC? I dunno.

The Map design in Sniper Elite 5 is both good and bad, if that makes any sense. Maps are still large and impressively detailed, supposedly they referenced real historical photos of Nazi-Occupied France and it really shows. The areas genuinely look like the real deal, and I'm not one to care all that much for scenery, but I can appreciate it when it shows up. Unfortunately, the map design can be really hit or miss from a gameplay standpoint, especially early on when the maps feel really close quarters-y. Again with the whole ""Commando Elite"" thing, the first half of the game has not many opportunities for long-distance sniping. This gets better later on and the maps do get a fair bit more open and visible after the first half, but it can be very off putting to quite a fair bit of people. I think the highlight of maps is how you discover objectives, some are given, some you have to find. Finding them can range from hearing a conversation between 2 soldiers, or by finding a collectable that indicates the objective (Usually a military document). Its a really novel system and I like the idea that not everything is laid out to you immediately, you actually have to do some scouting (You know, that thing that snipers would sometimes do, especially commandos working with a resistance?).

The story is pretty standard as far as the series goes. Karl Fairburne is dropped into X place to foil the plans of Y Nazi High-Ranking Officer to stop Z from happening, with Z usually being a war-winning superweapon or strategem. Moller is an okay antagonist as far as the series goes, he is not Bohm by any means, but he is not completely boring, Its fun watching him piss himself from Karl undoing his years of work.

Overall, Sniper Elite 5 is still a fun game and still manages to stay in the same vein as its Predecessors. Its not quite a step forward from 4 however. It feels almost as a side-grade, again bringing up the Megaman Zero 4 analogy for those who understand. It feels like it was made different for the sake of making it different from 4, for better and worse. Its a solid 7, maybe an 8 depending on your taste. I would at least recommend waiting for a sale unless you're really sold on the concept of sniping in france.


EDIT: Forgot to talk about bugs. This is probably due to me playing well past day 1, but I have not encountered any game breaking bugs, nor any that couldn't be solved by saving and then just reloading to fix a pathing issue (Looking at you Wolf Mountain). So I cannot comment on what people have experienced beforehand, for me it was relatively bug free aside from maybe a ragdoll inverting out of existence.",1661835635,1661844819,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Weapon mods are now meaningful with each mod affecting some of the weapon's attributes. You can really experiment with different play styles by playing with different mods.

AI's detection mechanics are different than in Sniper Elite 4 and I can already see that people are complaining - they are wrong.. I like the AI in 5. It's not better, it's not worse - it's different and refreshing. 

The only complaint I have is the targeting crosshair - it's simply too big, thick and prominent and obscures too much of a target when attempting really long distance shots.

But yeah... The game is as good as other Sniper Elite games - and still the best sniper franchise on the market.

Sniper Elite is, after all, a seventeen -year -old series that revolves around the sniper Karl Fairburne, who takes on the Nazis during the Second World War. The first parts revolved around fighting in Berlin, the third part brought Karl to Africa and the fourth part took place in Italy. Sniper Elite 5 uses an even more recognizable setting for many. This time Karl ends up in Normandy, where on the eve of D-Day he has to ensure that the invasion can be a success. Once in France, Karl tracks down a mysterious plan that, if we can believe the Nazis, the war can decide to their advantage. To the one -man army called Karl Fairburne, the clean task to thwart that operation!

Although there is a lot of tactical or if a sniper to go through, there is a lot of recognisability from the previous versions, which makes it less attractive for me, at least from my point of view. Furthermore, the entire gameplay is reasonable to properly adjust to any difficulty per game component, which can be quite useful to achieve and unlock certain achievements. And anyone who knows how to deal with that tactically can easily play the game and unlock all the achievements.

The possibility that other players can penetrate your game or level is a fun and exciting experience and gives an extra dimension. All in all a good game that gives beautiful pictures in the graphic area but at the same time a lot of the same from the previous versions and that makes it a bit monotonous. The yellow and red colors warn you that enemies are on the track or are in fighting. That works intuitively as a steering element; You don't want yellow and certainly no red at all. In addition, the game assesses you at the end of a mission and thereby shows elements as how often you have been seen through enemies and how often the alarm has gone off. So you are clearly sent in the direction of Stealth, which means that Sniper Elite 5 is indeed more a tactical spy game than just a pure snipers game.

As mentioned, it is possible to penetrate games from others, as a sniper on the German side. The player who is busy as Karl Fairburne then receives a report that there is an enemy sniper nearby with an indication of where that sniper is. The telephone system in the game that players can provide extra information about where the enemy is, is also a funny element. This creates a cat and mouse game between Karl and an enemy sniper, which without a doubt yields the most exciting moments in Sniper Elite 5. The dynamic changes when it becomes two-to-one. As soon as you as a loner manage to kill one of the two players, the other player from the team of two only has three minutes to kill you because otherwise you will win the game by definition. That produces a nice tactical issue. So it pays to try to attack one of the two players quickly, because you only have to keep yourself hidden afterwards to let the other take all the risks. And if you don't want all this, you can also turn off the option to have intruders in your game.

In summary, 'Sniper Elite 5' has nice parts, but it is not convinced to me enough and I found the storyline a bit boring. I understand the chosen course of the game developer and you can go through the game as well as a sniper or in stealth mode from start to finish. All in all, it looks like a kind of Hitman game. And for the target group that knows these games a little less well and is not waiting for a very high level of difficulty, then Sniper Elite 5 can be set so that it is still a very nice game. I think the purists among us will miss the focus on real sharp shooting, but at least they can also opt for an authentic level of difficulty.

This guy can hop up and scale a 7 ft wall, or vault over a hedge, but he can't step up onto a curb? He can't walk up a gentle slope. And where are the enemies? These maps are basically empty. Of course, you have the other issue, where enemies spawn literally out of nowhere while you're looking at that spot.

The game is decent, but there's nothing there that is in any way better than v.4. I'm extremely disappointed in this game, but I made that decision after it was too late to back out. Not the worst game I've played, but an extremely underwhelming purchase.

This game is similarly great however, they have changed the mechanics and scoring. Additional points towards rank may be scored by concentrating on non-lethal take outs. I find this to be tedious and not in line with any kind of war reality. Mechanics have changed in that the smaller booby traps are gone in favor of a non-lethal Shu mine. I really prefer the lethal small mines like the trip wire in SE4. TNT and Teller mines are in Sniper Elite 5 so lethality in mines is not all gone. Also I have tried to harvest mines from minefields which is possible in SE4 and so far have been unsuccessful in SE5. I may try this a few more times just to be sure, but I do not think you can harvest mines from German mine fields anymore. Mechanics of hiding in grass are similar. However, I notice enemies seems to search the grass more thoroughly in SE5. Noise masking from trucks, generators or airplanes works exactly the same as far as I can tell. 

The scenery in SE5 is beautiful. I particularly like Beaumont St Denis. I like the scenarios I have played so far and the weather patterns are interesting and/or challenging. It's a great game.

(1) The bullet starvation is ridiculous and forces the player to COD its way into the enemy just to get supplies. Want to limit inventory? Fine, make pistol and SMG ammo scarce, but the rifle should be abundant in quality and quantity. Fix the total amount of bullets the player may carry and let the player distribute them at pleasure. 
(2) Load out: Why do I have to look for a craw bar and cutter all the time? It should be an item the player chooses at start. 
(3) Ammo types: The player has 9 pouches of ammo types (3 per gun). Why in hell has to be fixed? I use 2 types for pistol and SMG while I crave to have most of them for the rifle. Let the player distribute. 
(4) Binoculars take forever. It is so ridiculous and tedious. And lots of times won't tag the pointed targets. 
(5) Frisking corpses is soooo boring just make a sound when the payer passes on top of the to get the items. 
(6) Armory: Common guys is a stupid game! make a room that is worth visiting with unlimited ammo refills, meds, and the enabling full customization (from ammo types to character). 
(7) Selecting an item is a nightmare! many times I threw a grenade when I really wanted to plant a mine. So the developers make me throw myself into he the enemy in a solo fire fight to get ammo (COD baby yea!). Then I get chased by  endless shooting zombie hordes and I can't lay my traps with confidence? Really? I felt like Willy Coyote so many times! I knew I shouldn't brought ACME products to the fight damm it! 
(8) The so called ""Decoy"". It's really a broomstick with a helmet with no value. It does not work and when it does, the Snipers freak out in yellow or red. And the troops around them freak out as well and some times raise the alarm.

Early reviewers have been critical that the 5th instalment hasn’t introduced enough new elements, but I think that Rebellion knows exactly what they want to accomplish with their franchise.  For me there are ample new elements to get excited about.  Much larger maps (with fantastic levels of details), more ways to approach an objective, unlocking optional objectives in mission, ability to customize you weapons through discovered workbenches.  None of these are game changing in their own right but the way it was implemented was done in a way to enhance the core Sniper Elite franchise.  I’ve enjoyed the game so much that that it is the first ever season pass I bought.
Added bonus:  Even though the game has always had a multiplayer option, the invasion mode is what I’m more excited about.

Good changes: 
Weapon customisation. I was sceptical at first, but it is a nice addition, as it does not make a gun a lot stronger or weaker, it instead shifts it's strengths and weaknesses around which is nice.

Infiltration mode: The mode itself is suprisingly fun, and even feels like a good match for sniper elite which i was not expecting. You do get reduced xp without it turned on, but it has little impact on your game.

The Bad changes:
they removed the rocks and replaced it with bottles you find everywhere. Why? just why? It changes the gameplay only a little, but takes away realisme which was appearently something they aimed for on this version. (*lengty laughter*)

The difficulty. It is so darn easy. Unless it's a vehicle, you can just run at the enemy Call of Duty style and win on all but the hardest difficulties. I remember struggling with sniper elite 4 on authentic plus - no saves. It was hardly a challenge to complete this game on authentic. 

The technical/gameplay stuff:

A.I.
Dear god... the A.I. is terrible. They essentially have 2 states. Braindead or cheater. In stealth you can just jog up to them and stab them. not sneak/crouch. JOG!. It's a joke. But god forbid you are looking at them from 30 meters away, because then they are suddenly hawks. Loud is no better. They either run past you like you don't exist, or they start shooting at you like wallhacks are activiated. It's garbage.

Then there is a lot of changes I am just not sure about. The new maps are mostly bigger and feel more authentic, yet at the same time most of them are very void of life. Not just NPC's, but also sounds and animals are very little to be seen. On top of that the game still feels like it guides you trough the map by blocking off a lot of alternative paths with bushes and barbed wire, so what is the point of having big open maps? You just go full walking simulator from location A to B to C.

They removed  many nice things from previous sniper elites. The officers are less important. The soldiers that I think are supposed to be the new valkeries are hardly any different then normal soldiers. Objectives now randomly pop up based on intel you find, making you run around the map a lot. The killcams make you see more, but also less, because the veins and flesh blocks most of your vision of the organs.

Then there is a lot of tiny things like the very annoying climbing and cover mechanisme and poor hit registrations, but I don't even want to get into that.

As a sniper elite game, I miss the hearth and soul of it.
As a sniper game that is more arcade, I kinda like it.
There is a lot of tiny things that frustrate me, but still enjoy it.",1653978856,1661007952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This successful series is serving an old recipe with some newly added buzzwordy ingredients, including weapon customization, non-lethal takedowns and more.

[h1]Setting[/h1]
This time, the year is 1944, the German stranglehold on Europe is loosening as desperation begins to set in for the Third Reich. The Allies are about to launch the largest amphibious assault ever to be seen in history. You play as Karl Fairburne, an elite sniper who has yet to find his match. Your objective, along with some U.S. Army Rangers, is to weaken the Atlantic wall in preparation for the Normandy landings. However, Fairburne soon assigns himself his own mission, destroying the new wunderwaffe, Operation Kraken.

[h1]Weapon Customization[/h1]
The most notable change to the series is the ability to select new attachments for your many armaments. Suppressors, muzzle brakes, night-vision scopes and more are among the various pieces one can use to modify their weapons. No longer must you be content with a single silenced sidearm or DLC weapon; you can now live out your dream of infiltrating enemy lines with suppressed SMGs.

However, one curious addition to all of this are less-than-lethal rounds, the long-range solution for a pacifist run, working in conjunction with non-lethal stealth takedowns. As far as I know, you don’t receive any bonuses — or achievements for that matter — for being a pacifist, other than being able to live out some grand fantasy of being an elite operative who saves their blade for the hearts of the most malicious of enemies, if they even have a heart. Do be careful, however, that your unconscious victims don’t land in centimeter-deep puddles, they will hilariously drown themselves and you will have a conscience to clear.

[h1]Level layout[/h1]
The missions in [b]Sniper Elite 5[/b] feel like they were an attempt at making realistic levels that felt like they were organically evolving and to some extent they achieved this. The previous entry in the series had almost every, if not all, optional objectives revealed to you through character interactions before even starting the mission, sort of like a debriefing, whereas [b]Sniper Elite 5[/b] will often have optional objectives revealed to you either by listening in on conversations between soldiers, or simply stumbling upon them as you go from point A to B. Many missions also have roads with traffic going through checkpoints, which stop those vehicles for inspection making the map feel alive, though the illusion may only last through your first campaign.

None of that is to say that this game’s level layout is a masterpiece. As much as I jumped for joy at the ability to mount stationary machine guns, I didn’t find an opportunity to use it, that being said, I didn’t perform any sort of extensive search to find said opportunity.

[h1]The Resistance[/h1]
One feature I was hoping to see the return of were resistance forces. The previous installment saw the Italian partisans fighting the fascists in skirmishes for at least two missions. Disappointingly, however, you never see the French resistance forces fight anywhere. Fairburne even participates in an airborne assault on German positions along with Army Rangers, but you never see them in action either; it’s like having your significant other send a lewd text, only to find them sleeping in bed when you get home.

[h1]Axis Invasion[/h1]
On a more positive note, there’s another new addition to the formula; the Axis Invasion game mode allows you to drop into another player’s campaign as Jäger, Fairburne’s Nazi counterpart whose description declares him as infamous, but he may be better described as being opportunistic.

The best time for Jäger to strike is when his rival is in a firefight, when he will be ensnared and unaware of the glare coming from Jäger’s scope. Therefore, those going up against Jäger must not get tied down in an unwinnable fight. It is best for Fairburne to run and hide, rather than become a sitting duck for Jäger’s crosshair. But one particularly useful skill Fairburne does boast is his innate ability to sense from which direction Jäger might be coming from until he gets too close, then Fairburne’s senses will tell you that he’s right on top of you. Jäger, however, may get even more detailed information on his rival’s location as he can have fellow soldiers report it directly to him. Notably, however, Jäger can invade a co-op campaign and in that instance, should he be successful in eliminating one sniper, the other will have just three minutes to avenge his friend’s death.

This game mode has the potential to make a high-stakes game of stealth, however good luck in finding a good match if you don’t have a friend to play with. Rarely did I find a skillful sniper in strangers’ campaigns. Most of the time they abandoned the idea of stealth at the first sign of trouble leading to an easy win for Jäger.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Much of the [b]Sniper Elite[/b] series could be accurately described as a casual stealth experience, the same is true here — especially so in many co-op campaigns — with the potential exception of Axis Invasion, which makes stealth a borderline-necessity. [b]Sniper Elite 5[/b] took around 20 hours to complete the campaign, mostly stealthing with a few instances of careless running-and-gunning plus a half hour of incidentally recreating the JFK assassination with a Nazi officer. The non-existence of friendly soldiers clashing with Germans is only disappointing because of the potential that such an improvement could’ve brought, the Italian partisans were present in the last game, but they felt like a test run rather than an integral part of the game. Thus with all that being said, most of what was present in [b]Sniper Elite 4[/b] is still present here, with a few great additions and all with the latest game being cheaper in price, thus I think veterans of the series will like this iteration. Overall, it was quite enjoyable and I can see myself playing through it again.",1660946237,1660946237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2: Trick and Kill everyone and find everything
3: Go stealth but mark everyone and kill less. 

The game is made to be able to finish in stealth, but you need to learn the the different missions. There you have the replay value. You are familiar with the surroundings and now you can start to think and plan. 

Third time is much more easy, but you should go to higher difficulty then to  keep the challenge.

2.5 STARS OUT OF 5 


I am a full series veteran of the Sniper Elite series, especially Sniper Elite 4. I recommend the game to anyone who has enjoyed previous installments. It pretty much picks up right where the series leaves off. 
-Story is familiar and all but I was not super impressed by the progression that I would expect from a solid title.
-  The controls might be the worst of the series, taking into account that it is 2022. This is the main reason for my lower rating. Doing simple things liked climbing a ladder or trying to search multiple dead bodies near one another is awful. It is worse than SE4 was IMO
- I really love the landscape and architectural graphics but again, the terrible masses of ""tiny objects"" that halt you in your tracks or seem like you should be able to climb/vault but cannot, its pretty bad too.
- Combat is satisfying and not too terribly different than the previous games. I like shootin' Nazis, they've got me. 
- Sniper Elite is a niche serious IMO abut they should try to evolve their series a little bit. I am not sure I would buy a SE4 expansion if it is literally just another map or 2. Lets see how it ages!",1660582131,1660582131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall SE 4 is better in my opinion but if your a new to the sniper elite franchise you will enjoy SE 5 for the gun-ho rambo arcade play style .

few months have passed  & rebellion have fixed many of the bugs in-game.

I have not returned to se5 due to being my least favoured game in the franchise & would much sooner play se4 which was and still is the best sniping game i have played .

I would also like to add that i will not be purchasing any future sniper elite game releases as i'm not happy with the way the franchise are heading as it just does'nt appeal to me anymore which is a shame .

I will continue to play SE 5 when new content is released due to the season pass .",1653744245,1660510815,False,0,0,0.437853127717971802,0,True,False,False

The highlight of the game and what makes it worth it is the invasion system which creates these really unique and tense encounters. I never know what is going to happen when I invade someone. One game I invade a new console player who after he finds my location stands up in the open on a hill and gets a bullet through his skull fired from my rifle. Another I get into a twenty minute long game of cat and mouse across a wide open area in a sniper duel. The maps are big but you can use evidence in order to find the other sniper once you are used to the game and the maps.
Now for the negative, I experienced plenty of bugs and a few hackers but the most frustrating thing is the mantling system. Some fences can be scaled but some can't without much difference between them. There are invisible walls in areas that you should be able to enter and the climbing system often takes you in the opposite direction of where you want to go. Sometimes the AI bugs out and does bizarre things or the alarm gets stuck on and never turns off.
It is a bit frustrating but the invasion mechanic makes it worth it and adds a ton of replayability to the game.

Only thing i hate in this game are these - the Battlefield it self, its like not made for sniping... Like first 2 misions i couldnt get a longer shot then 150m. weapons locked behind kill challanges, mission completion or enemy weapons have only a mag in them then you trow them away and glitches are here too - Soldiers when they die are doing poses like if they broke their backs or their legs apart like if they were riding a goddamn horse and Ai is kinna dumb. But atleast it isnt that common so it is playable. Is game authentic? FUCKING FINALY NOT FUCKING CENSORING OF SWASTIKA AND IMPERIAL JAPANESE FLAG - BIG FUCKING PLUS! Balistics and weapons too, but weapons that werent used during ww2 (like your beggining weapons) and their ''upgraids'' make your weapon look like a joke BUT atleast it isnt a Cod Vanguard level and thats good. Now what i like about this game - The story. I must say it ended up being rly good. Also this is the first game that we see Imperial japanese in Europe. Story has that pretty well explained. REAL uniforms and not something stupid and main characters arent a political joke. AND THAT IS BIG PLUS. New game mode - Axis invasion. My heart was beating like hell when i was goind against enemy players as snipers and that is the feeling i dont experience a lot in my life. Sounds are rly good, but sniper elite 4 were better. But if ya seek perfection - you have to go stealth, you can choose your enemies fate - to let them live or kill them and if ya let them live then at the end you get A LOT OF XP. Speaking of which you now have skills -1 skill point for teir 1,2 skill points for teir 2 and 3 for the third. And a lot of kinds of ammo - Normal, Armor-piercing, Soft-point,not-lethal and silent ammo.  Also lots of enemies - Normal soldiers, Jagers (who can resist a lot of punishment and cant be attacked from front by melee, Snipers (clasic), JAGER SNIPERS ARE (as an AI) the ones who will most of times put ya down if you dont watch them, Officiers, Japanese officers, jager officers, scientists and final is support jager - NEVER GO AGAINST THEM IN FRONT!

You get placed on maps where you think - at last, I can be a sniper - except there is no proper vantage point, and no clear shots, and then you notice a few enemies nearby that you will hear you so you have to clear them first by going up close, and then move back out of earshot before sniping the original targets.

Truly astonishing how frustrating the game is and how limited the real sniping opportunities.

More like an old medal of honour game really - and if that's what you like, then its a good game. But you're a Commando who happens to have a scope on his rifle - rather than a Sniper.

Oh, and I'm on mission 6 of 8, wondering when I might finally be rewarded with a silencer for my sniper rifle, so that I can take out nearby targets by sniping rather than stealth - only then do I read the small print. You have to find the rifle workbench in mission 2 - a workbench I just happened to overlook as I just wasn't that interested in completing everything.

So the XP rewards are nice but not that great - and the one piece of equipment I am desperate for is out of reach unless I go back and re-play mission 2. What a joke. It should be available from any rifle workbench after mission 2 - not SOLELY from the mission 2 workbench. (Sadly, despite finding a few workbenches across the different missions - I also missed the rifle workbench in mission 5 - so the upgraded silencer is also out of reach - given that you can modify any weapon from any workbench, it was a bit surprising to find that the game distinguishes between workbenches at all)",1660129933,1660129933,False,5,1,0.508670508861541748,0,True,False,False

I don't understand all the people in here complaining about how they do more sniping in <enter non-sniping game here> than in SE5. If you chose to go in guns blazing, mow down everything with the MG42 and chuck some nades you can hardly moan about the lack of sniping opportunities.
If you don't make use of the custom difficulty options and then go on about how there's too much UI clutter and how the aim assist is literal cheating you can't expect people to take your opinion seriously.

SE5 surely does a lot of things worse than SE4, especially when it comes to terrain interaction (vaulting, invisible walls, crap like that), but level design isn't one of them. The maps are huge, allow for a range or even mix of approaches, open things up for replayability, can be punishing, but never unfair and are generally not as CQC excessive as is often claimed. Also, they look amazing. Seriously, Beaumont-Saint-Denis and Saint Nezaire are probably among the most atmospheric levels I have ever seen.
You can and will snipe a whole bunch - IF you care to find and secure suitable locations to set up in. If you don't, well..

The AI is still pretty braindead, no point in sugar-coating it, but if you're looking for a challenge you can still Sam Fisher this on Authentic (or Custom) and have a hell of a time regardless.
SE5 is a respectable successor to SE4 with a lot of improvements and a few downgrades here and there. I very much enjoyed my 45ish hours so far and will continue to do so, hopping into the DLC mission.

Addendum: gun modeling and textures are superb (with a few tiny exceptions), same for accessories (minus suppressors).

Major improvement compared to SE4 which was already a long step ahead of previous SE titles.

Parkour feels nice, many different ways to play each level.

However as good as the game is,
some flaws are unforgivable

There is an uncommon but still prevalent bug that corrupts your save files. Even if you have files backed up there's little chance those would work too. 
In a game where there's a grind (scopes, silencers, guns) you can't simply forget about it and start from scratch.

Don't be put off at the start - the first ten, fifteen minutes of the first mission seem rather restrictive in where you can actually go to achieve the set goals, but after that, freedom to move around a vast world gets somewhat better.  
This world in Sniper Elite 5 is simply beautiful.  Campaign Italy in Sniper Elite 4 was good, but this is even better.  The detail is simply incredible - a huge variety of scenic battlegrounds combined with close quarter town elements provide a breathtaking experience.  It is simply beautiful.
Game play is far more challenging.  It takes a few missions to develop a style of play that you find works.  There are multi objectives in each of the main missions bar the very last one whcih is a bit of an add-on compared to the other missions.  There are far more enemies around - you simply cannot go in guns blazing with a hope of blasting everyone in sight and surviving.  Strategy is needed - a space to bail out to if things get tough - and boy are things easier if alarms are not triggered.  Added to that - weapon tactics are much more realistic in this game.  In SE4, you could pick up a weapon, keep it, and add copious amounts of ammo to it as you progressed each mission.  Here, you pick up a weapon, and can only use the ammo left in it before either going back to your own weapon, or finding another similar weapon to use.  Far more challenging and realistic.
The sniping element has changed the least in my view.  Depending on what level of difficulty you play, the sniping mechanics are pure Snipe Elite as it always has been.  Unlike Ghost Warrior Contracts, sniping distances are not that extreme.  However, the cut scenes are pretty brutal and weapon sounds are a huge step forward.
Afraid the voice acting is just as bad as it ever was, but there we go....you won't be buying this game for the cut scenes which are still somewhat predicable and hackneyed.  
I like to play each level to the full - if you want to, you can take a good two hours game play for each of the major levels in this game.  And each mission has such wonderfully created environments.  Most compelling and enjoyable.
Tanks and vehicles are more difficult to destroy - this is one part of the game play thatis nothing like previous SE episodes.  You will need Panzershreks or armour piercing weaponry and ammunition to destroy tanks and such like in SE5.  Much more of a challenge than sniping gunners and drivers as experienced in SE4.
There aren't many games that I'd justify not waiting for a sale price - this is one of them.  Buy it.  It is a load better than SE4 and that is saying something.
At the time of writing, there are two major issues that need sorting - one is the lack of zoom functionality on the middle mouse when in sniping mode.  It's designed to work, but doesn't for me.  Secondly, the zip wire bizz has a bad habit of freezing up which stalls the game play badly.  Save before zip wiring, and it's ok.",1656454519,1660040989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- New first person aiming mechanic
- Improved weapon sound mechanics (such as decreasing stealth effectiveness of suppressors at point-blank range)

Cons:
- Clunky movement (was using a PS4 controller at first)
- Weapons customization odd and imbalanced
- Many series familiar weapons not included, possibly blocked behind a DLC paywall
- The campaign maps are meh at best, not many long distance shots.
- THE MULTIPLAYER MAPS are WAY too close range. 
- Campaign AI are WAY too easy. Some players even saying Authentic difficulty is hardly a challenge, compared to Authentic and Authentic Plus from Sniper Elite 4, which were insanely challenging and engaging. 
- Vehicle kills and weak spots basically non-existant in SE5

I love you Rebellion, but this release is insanely weak.

[h2]Sniper Elite 5 Review[/h2]
	
[h2]Storyline[/h2]
I am pretty sure you would have realized that the Sniper Elite series are gameplay-heavy games. In Layman’s terms, the Sniper Elite series is known for the Genre-specific gameplay rather than the storylines. People play this game just to attain satisfaction from the kill cams or for the fun co-op experience they offer. 

There is a lot of redundancy in the storyline across the series. It usually involves infiltrating bases, taking out the higher-ups, and finally killing Adolf Hitler. The games’ plots are always something along these lines. So, if you’re looking for a proper unique storyline in this game, this isn’t meant for you. Let me sum up the entire plot in one line:

[code]Play again as Karl Fairburne in 1944 France as he fights to uncover a secret Nazi project called Project Kraken.[/code]

Yeah yeah, it’s the same ol’ plot. Karl is immortal or some shit & Hitler can apparently respawn. Alright, I’ll stop questioning the logic in this game’s story.

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics[/h2]
The gameplay part of the game is what made this series so popular. The kill cams and the gory after-effects of your shots are what the players find most appealing. Well, here are the multiple segments again:

[b][u]Core Gameplay[/u][/b]
The core gameplay remains the same. As I mentioned in the introduction, Sniper Elite has established a solid gameplay. It’s already challenging and fun. It is because of this that the developers are not trying to introduce any major differences whenever they release a new part. And the good thing is, people are barely complaining. 

So, each mission takes place in an open-worldish environment where you are given multiple objectives. Yeah, the objectives are very similar to the ones from the previous games; killing targets, destroying stuff, etc. The very generic shooter game objectives. What’s good is that you are given completely free reign on how you approach these tasks. There’s no laid path for you to follow to complete the missions. Since it’s an open-world setting, you get to choose your own approach; stealth or guns blazing. I prefer stealth since that’s how a sniper should actually take down their targets. At the same time, I take up the guns-blazing approach when I run thin on patience. 

You must be wondering how one would take a guns-blazing approach in a Sniper-focused game. Well, you have secondary weapons. These secondary weapons obviously have less ammo to discourage relying on them all the time. It’s best to use them when you’re in a pinch or want to take out someone in close range!

[b][u]So, What’s New?[/u][/b]
Apart from the usual upgrades to the already existing features, Rebellion apparently added a handful of new features to Sniper Elite 5. So, here is the list of the so-called new features:
[olist]
[*] [b]Improvements to the game’s campaign:[/b] They’ve taken references from real places and included them in the game now. Some assets used are the result of photogrammetry which gives them more detail since they are basically scans of real objects. You can now share ammunition and healing items with your co-op partner. 
[*] [b]Weapon customization and Map Traversal:[/b] Weapon customization has become a bit more detailed by allowing you to customize almost every part of the weapon. Traveling across the map has been enhanced a bit through the addition of slopes and ziplines which can come in handy in various situations.
[*] [b]Invasion Mode:[/b] This is an entirely new campaign-based PvP mode they introduced in this part. This allows randoms to invade your playthrough. Their main target is taking you out. This adds a bit more spice to your playthrough while making it a bit more challenging. 
[*] [b]An Enhanced Killcam:[/b] The Killcam in the Sniper Elite series has been one of the most vital features the game offers. They keep on making it better and better with every new release. So, it’s pretty obvious that they have made a lot of improvements to the kill cam in this game. It’s more graphic than ever!
[/olist]
[i]Source: [url=https://gamerant.com/sniper-elite-5-improvements-campaign-weapons-traversal/#:~:text=Sniper%20Elite%205%20will%20additionally,companion%20within%20co%2Doperative%20gameplay.]Gamerant Website on the Same Topic.[/url][/i]

So yeah, this is all the new stuff the game offers. Not a lot but the core gameplay is what would keep you hooked. And yes, I had to look up the stuff that was new in this game since they were not very obvious when I played the game. I hope the next part will have actual noticeable introductions.

[b][u]Difficulty Modes[/u][/b]
So, there’s a new difficulty mode in Sniper Elite V named “Civilian”. It’s now the easiest mode. The other difficulty modes are the same as they were in the previous parts:
[olist]
[*] [b]Civilian:[/b] As the name suggests, pretend that a civilian is given a Sniper Elite and is thrown into the battlefield. The civilian would now know how to fend for themselves. Hence, everything should be easy as fuck in order for the civilian to have higher odds of surviving. That’s basically this mode, easy as fuck.
[*] [b]Cadet:[/b] This is the somewhat easy mode where weapon ballistic is omitted and the AI would have the IQ of a rock. 
[*] [b]Sharpshooter:[/b] Basically, a slightly harder difficulty mode where bullet drop is a thing. Enemies can now aim a bit better and can deal a bit more damage to you.
[*] [b]Sniper Elite:[/b] Oh my god! This difficulty mode is the name of the game! But it isn’t the hardest difficulty mode. This is where the actual sniper ballistics come into play. You have no assistance whatsoever. Everything becomes manual.
[*] [b]Authentic:[/b] The hardest mode the game has to offer. As the name states, this mode is as hard as real-life….apparently. It requires a lot of skill since enemies are as sharp as a knife and can deal a shit tonne of damage to you. Pretty sure they can one-shot you.
[/olist]

Apart from these, there’s obviously a custom difficulty mode where you can alter the difficulty of the different aspects of the game. These options not only make the game tailor-made for you but also add a lot to the replayability rate. 

[h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]

The visuals have greatly improved when compared to its predecessor. Everything is way more detailed and polished right now. I love the new gorey and overly-detailed kill cam kills. It’s way more satisfying! The visuals are an easy 10/10! As for the audio part of the game, I am not really sure what to say since I didn’t pay that much attention to it. I was a bit too focused on the gameplay…

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] The killcam still reigns supreme.
[*] You have complete freedom on how you want to approach a mission.
[*] The AI is challenging depending on your chosen difficulty mode.
[*] There’s quite a handful of difficulty modes to choose from which adds a bit to the game’s variety and replayability rate.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] The story is very dull and kinda repetitive since the previous games have a similar plot.
[*] The missions also feel repetitive.
[*] There are minor bugs but I am sure the developers will rectify them in the upcoming updates!
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Sniper Elite games always manage to fascinate me. I am a sucker for the kill cams and the authentic sniper mechanics. Yeah, the game is a bit too pricey. It is worth that price but I do recommend waiting for a sale. It’s very expensive since it might be considered a AAA Release. If you wait long enough, I am sure the game would go for a dirt-cheap price!

For the weapons, or rather the lack of, I have to agree. The selection is quite limited. Though I have to say that this is somewhat redeemed by the new weapon customization. Furthermore I am just in love with the new invasion mode, where another player can attack you during your singleplayer mission.

The frequency with which the game crashes with ""GPU Device Lost. Closing Program"" is quite a pain. 
Compared to Sniper Elite 3 & 4, in this game... it's like they regressed backwards in everything but graphics.
 
Level design seems to be the main weakness. With a new edition, one would have thought they'd give you more freedom of movement, more things to climb, more places to hide, more sense of immersion in interacting with a realistic environment, but instead it feels like a game from 15 years ago: The number of places you can't go, can't do, the insanely high number of hedgerows all over the place, and tiny walls that our supposedly-badass dude can't climb over... it feels so limiting its bizarre.
And the enemies see you a mile away and swarm.  Such has been complaints from others in the past for previous SE games but I really feel it this time around. 
Even with customizing the difficulty types, the actual sniping stays pretty easy and trivial, and the ""holy **** these guys keep coming out of the woodwork and locating me too easily"" just seems ....off, compared to previous editions of the game. 
So far I'd say: Sniper Elite 4 was way more fun. 
Rating: 3/5.  Not worth full price.

PS- There never seems to be any point in using the Workbench.  None of the options offer any clear advantages.  Perhaps the designers felt that added some realism but...I'd rather be able to progress through the game improving my gear, not just making trade-offs from the get-go. 
PPS- And wow could they have nerfed the silent pistol any more?

Generally speaking, most games are horrible about getting the small details of kit right. while this game does still have stuff wrong, its *technically* correct even if unlikely (for 1944) for so much early war kit to be plentiful.


The german kit, overall, is quite good albeit basic. The regular infantry is clearly based on a reenactor, as the gas mask can is identical to the modern reproduction cans, which have shallower ribs in the can compared to an authentic gas mask can. The tunic is an early war M36, with early war Litzen on the collar. The shirt is the mid-late war soft cotton it seems, which is a common reenactor-ism. That is, being worn for an impression covering any time period of the war. The boots are well done, especially gamaschen with the low boots. 

You do have one mistake early in the video regarding low boots. They were not issued as a cost-saving measure, they were issued alongside the marching boots. Their frequency within units all depended on the unit itself. Some units were only issued lowboots and others just marching boots. 

The officer seems to be wearing the iron cross first class, second class ribbon and a knights cross on his neck... which is ambitious for a generic field officer.

The Jaeger class is just a Fallschirmjaeger, which is also well done. The zeltbahn tents are also well done, along with the weaponry and German vehicles. The helmets are late war M42 helmets, which would have been an odd combination with an early war tunic. They have good k98 ammo pouches, but I was disappointed to not see any K43 pouches in the game. 

All the small details, kit laying around, field items like the trinkwasser, and propaganda posters are a great touch. 

For vehicles and equipment markings, they just picked unit logos out of a bucket it seems. The anti-tank guns all seem to be the smaller 37mm, which was gone by 1944, and they have the logo of the 12th SS on them. 

US uniforms are quite rough. but alright.

The story leaves much to be desired, but there are some comical oversights. Such as you liberate the town in Liberate, advancing North, only to have Sherman tanks move through the town to advance south... where you just killed like 100 people. Overall, the game's story is easily forgotten, it is generic as hell. But if you like shooting Germans in ww2, popping skulls and nutsacks, this is the game for you.  8/10 imo",1659661034,1659661034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. Also no game is safe from a review whether its early access or full release now onto the review.

Sniper Elite 5 is a great sniping video game. You playing as the famous Karl Fairburne in finding out a secret German nazi weapon in 1944. This game is absolutely amazing-ish. 

The campaign is pretty slandered from the other Sniper Elite games. Find a main nazi bad guy, snipe them & done. You can pick different difficulties from I link lowest is civilian to authentic but they now added more customization options to suit a players comfort when playing. 

Graphics looks amazing even on the lowest setting possible it just amazing. There wasn't a lot wrong with the graphics except for when you join in on other players missions you sometimes will have bad graphic quality for a few seconds. 

Weapon sounds were okay but if I am being 100% honest they all sounded the same to me except the anti-tank rife. I am not sure its just my bad hearing or I wasn't paying enough attention to the weapon sounds but they just sounded the same to me. The rifles sounded the same to each other, the SMGs founded the same to each other & the pistols as well.

Game-play was okay, movement wasn't bad except for the auto cover messing a few things up. Aim movement was actually okay for my default, normally I have to adjust it higher but this was okay. Another thing I had an issue was the buttons being the same for so many different things. Throwing stuff sometimes bugged out to where Karl would just be stuck in the throw animation for a long time. There was the re-load loop issue where you select an ammo type & Karl would just infinitely reload the weapon until you re-select another ammo type. 

Weapons were okay but I didn't like how they were locked through challenges or finding workbenches. Skill leveling would have been nice to do for the weapons & attachments should have been challenges (& some are). 

Attachments are good I guess, I didn't see any issue with them except for the pistol scopes & the pistol suppressors not showing on the gun sometimes. 

Axsi Invasions is where a player is an enemy sniper trying to kill you or your partners if your in a joined match. I turned this feature off in my game but some players I joined has this on & I don't think its a bad idea since it gives a slight more exp reward. The only issue I had was helping a player in his mission & we defeated an invader (damn sounds like Elden Ring & Dark Souls over here) 5/6 times. I would like to see a system where you defeat an invader you can't get invaded again until the next mission. 

Survival is how it sounds, you survive waves of nazi's. I can't remember is this was in Sniper Elite 3 but I know it was in Sniper Elite 4. 

Multiplayer is blank for me meaning I don't know how it is due to never trying it. I my first SE multiplayer was in SE4 & first game there was a hacker which put off multiplayer for SE forever.

Accessories were okay, there were some changes from SE4 to SE5 like no trip wires anymore. The only issue I had with the accessories was the satchel charges unlock requirements were never explained better. It only said complete the campaign to unlock which I did on the easiest difficulty & never unlocked them come to find out it has to be hardest (authentic) difficulty to unlock them since I did easiest to hard & still didn't unlock the satchel charges.  

With all said & done I felt SE5 is nothing new really. Its just the same the previous games. Only thing new (from what I can tell) is the Axi Invasions & thats it. The DLC is the ame & the campaign is just repeat. I would love see Rebellion take a bold move & try something else like a different time era. Don't get me wrong Rebellion does amazing work I think better then Underdog Studio. 

So Sniper Elite 5 gets 5/10 score from me making just average but I still recommend buying this game also the other Sniper Elite games as well.

I've played the previous games on all levels including authentic with no saves, so I got a reasonable amount of experience. The thing I didn't like and got me killed a couple times were the restricted jumping over fences and hanging off ledges. In SE 4 I don't recall ever having to worry about hopping a two foot high fence or wall to avoid detection. But in SE5 I learned the hard way that sneaking past a sentry and hopping over the fence before he turns around is a gamble because - nope- that part of the fence in unhoppable. Or that part of the ledge is unhangable.  You have to creep along to find that one spot. But you can't risk that when trying to quickly get past or avoid a busy spot.  I don't know why they changed this from SE4 but it's highly annoying.  I also found myself spinning and twisting more in order to grab an item or open a safe - you have to be in such a precise spot that it became very frustrating. The game kept popping up the planet charge on safe option when I had the key and every little move would flash the key option only to disappear when you stopped. Spinning, twisting, around and around.

PROS: 
Exploration, and map design.
General improvement on the Sniper Elite Formula.
Gun customization, and iron sights. (but nothing too wacky)
Lots more replay-ability. Maps are very well designed with multiple routes, hidden rooms, and caches. Lots of fun just finding different paths and ways to go about sneaking, stabbing, and sniping.

CONS:
Not all weapons have iron sights available. (1903, and M1 Carbine).
Not enough weapons for base game.
Annoying white outline when hiding in grass that also outlines iron sights. (needs a patch to toggle on/off)
Cannot swap loadout weapons for weapons found. you can pick up weapons and use them, you just cant swap a weapon in you're loadout for them, its weird.
I personally am annoyed when i see flame/heat trails in the bullet cam. just these weird orange and yellow lines coming out the back of the bullet doesn't look good IMO.

Of course I bought into the Hype surrounding the game and I have to say am I disappointed in this game.

 Pre-pay months ahead of time, slowly play tease a few screen shots and little video, then pop up with the news that you won't be seeing many of the Rifles,Hand Guns, SMG's from the previous games we enjoyed, followed by a Story Arch that was good-ish but nothing as entertaining as the Characters and cut scene's of SE4. Slow to fix bugs and release DLC then Boom! Instant Disappointment. I have since lost interest in the game and I Don't know that I will be revisiting even with new DLC. Many fans of SE4 that I know also feel this same way (Which people are still playing btw). SE4 has a special place in my heart but this game just doesn't cut it. For as long as they made people wait this could have been much much better. 

With the Negative out of the way I will say that SE5 has some really good improved game play Idea's attached. . . . But that's about all I can give for a Positive.

Still I can't recommend enough that someone play's SE4 first before trying SE5. You'll see what I mean.

It feels like 10 extra missions for Sniper Elite 4, which would be fine (I loved SE4) on its own... but the new features for SE5 are all riddled with different issues.

Navigating the map is awkward, with inconsistent, unpredictable object interaction. Every map is covered in knee-high obstacles that Karl refuses to vault or climb. Karl constantly gets stuck on things, and decides to ""climb"" on objects when you are trying to vault, which results in awkwardly flipping back and forth over an object. You get used to it eventually.

The Invasion mode is a cool idea. The other reviews saying they are upset enabling Invasions is a requirement for XP are hyperbolic; the bonus XP is very small and will not be the reason why you do (or don't) level up and unlock perks. But there are a lot of half baked issues with the implementation: For example, the number of players who fucking ALT F4 the second they get hit. If I down an Invader and he quits like a little bitch before I can finish him off (or quits DURING THE KILL CAM), I should get a ""kill"" not a ""Invader Fled.""

Invasions also don't tie into any other part of the game. Completing 100 invasion kills unlocks cosmetics as an invader... it does not grant any cosmetics for singleplayer or multiplayer. There really should be a camo, a rifle wrap, even a stupid hat, I don't care.

Also, Karl will not shut the fuck up about how much he fucking loves tall grass. Every time you so much as look at a strand of wheat in this game, Karl will let you know about the fat load in his pants ready to blast all over you the second he touches some tall grass.

Invasions are HEAVILY in the player's favor. I don't mind the player being at a slight advantage but as it is, you can see the invader coming in from miles away. You can also clear out a map, cover it in as many landmines as you want, and then bait easy invader kills. The Invader, meanwhile, doesn't know which difficulty settings are turned on - are you unkillable? Can you see through walls? etc",1653867394,1659399466,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The game looks good and the kill cam is allways a pleasure, and that's about that.
Gameplay is stricted to predefined terrians and roads. You just can't jump around, walk where you want or climb down a slope. 
Invisible barriers are annoying and cause a lot of dislikes. I tried to chase a few germens and found out that they ran into the berriers.
Even with the highest difficulty it's still very easy to hit the shot even from a great distance.
Missions are like a play ground with no points of sniper or sneak options.

Not only is it super short, it's not a sniping game! It became a stealth game with mediocre equipment. Think Wolfenstein without the campy storyline or any of the interesting gear. The story is as bland as can be and you basically find yourself using the same blah-rifle you start with since the game doesn't let you keep any of the better equipment you find along the way. It doesn't even let you keep the ammo you collected. It would have had some redeeming quality if it was open world, but it isn’t. The maps are very linear and there are basically 4 enemies. You are fighting a clone army, but not in any cool sense.
Finally, most fighting is in streets and building, meaning there is not real opportunity to try and snipe most of the time. I think there were two maps in which I could really make a nice long shot and feel like I was in one of the old versions of the game.

If that's what one expect SE5 isn't quite up to par, can't really put my finger on why though. I'm a 98% pve player though, so that might be why.

On its own though, it's a game where you can roam around on big maps - not open world as you will find paths iinexplicably blocked, although you can get to the area behind that block by taking another route ... somewhat irritating. 

I'm a somewhat exploring type of gamer, and in that capacity this game tend to reward me when I start roaming around and not just follow the main mission points. Extra missions pops up, special killing missions and so on, and that's always fun.

So ... I do like the game, just need to take time to explore a little, and its rewarding - the ai isn't all that stupid, allthough it could be better ... and possibly a few more npcs.

Spotting enemies or other things with binoculars are harder (it was too easy in SE4) so it's all good in my opinion. But it's harder to snipe at distance since enemies will not spawn until you have traversed a certain distance or threshold/spot in the game (which make it interesting when choosing a path different than the developers thought you would take - that some enemies do not spawn in their spots the first time, only when you circle around and pass a certain threshold/spot is passed. But again, that was a trait with SE4 too.

I agree to an extent with other reviews that the game play is tilted to a more wargame, or stealth, type. Its sometimes impossible tow snipe, at a distance, since enemies are now spawned until a certain threshold/pot is triggered. That's a little bit sad -- that is, you shouldn't need to run around an trigger thresholds/spots and then run away to get good sniping distance (if you can).

Meaty and crunchy Bullet Time Killcam. Multiplayer has some nice maps, Survival is quite nice to cheese sometimes (if the enemies play along).
Campaign is a bit bugged, I can't Exfiltrate the War Factory (Mission 4), so for now I gotta stick to the other modes.
Speaking of other Modes, Invasion! Pretty cool to be able to invade other players' campaign. It becomes a game of cat and mouse, having to play as a German Sniper Jäger to hunt down the Protagonist.

Originally posted 2022-06-03.
Update on 2022-07-29:
After having played the game for the over two months its been out now and getting over 200 hours, here's an update.

It's still fun. The Campaign looses a bit of replayability, especially because your Level is capped at 40. You just don't progress any further than that. Would have loved to have infinite levels, or at least several hundreds. As it is now, someone with Lv 40 could have just reached it, or been there for months. There is no way to gauge how long someone played the game from this.

Loads of bugs have been squashed by the devs. What I mentioned with Exfiltrating on Mission 4 (War Factory) has been fixed, and more recently you could actually get the No Stone Unturned achievement for completing all optional objectives (16 total across 8 missions).

The Axis Invasion is an absolute blast. As the invader you can infiltrate another players Campaign as a German Soldier and your goal is to sabotage Karl by killing him. Rebellion have nerfed the Invader quite a lot with the two recent updates (early July and a few days ago). First reduced the Invaders health pool from 125 to 100 HP and adjusted Grenades and Teller Mines from 2 to 1 each. More recently they've silently removed additional Ammo types (sub-sonic, armor-piercing, soft-point). The Karls that were complaining about it got what they wanted (I guess?), even though that Karl has all the advantages that you could wish for. 150 HP, replenishable ammo, different types thereof, literal wallhacks (""Focus""), more Traps. Despite this I already got over 300 kills as the Invader 🙃
Aaaannyway...

If you've played Sniper Elite 4 before, this game might be a bit of a disappointment. If this is your first entry into the series, go for it. You'll enjoy it.
With all that said, I've played SE3 and SE4 before, and I really like SE5. Despite its shortcomings.",1654285434,1659104645,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It wasn't a Max Payne quality story line by any means but it will do in this era of Zombie and multiplayer survival games. I never mind paying the prices for PC games that have a great single player story  and a lot of action. 
I haven't really seen many bugs or glitches like a lot of players are complaining about, at least nothing that is a deal breaker for me, then again I'm just happy to see a game in this style come out so maybe I'm just not noticing them.
Graphics are decent, but kind of bland for this era of 1,000 Horse Power graphic cards.

Super fun! Definitely worth the money.

The graphics aren't the prettiest; Some of the swaying flowers look 2D and stretched, etc. 

The map does at times feel very limited in how much it allows you to move through it.  I wish there was a bit more freedom to climb map rubble, jump over/move through more of the bushes, etc.

Game can be fun with a friend, however they go forwards in some areas, and backwards in others. For a sniping game, there sure are a lot of invisible walls. The term open world loosely applies to the game when you put invisible barriers up that severely limit your avenues of approach which mainly hurts you in Axis Invasion. The focus ability that the Allied sniper has should not be implemented the way it is currently in Axis Invasion. I understand trying to level the playing field but if you use focus, it feels overpowered, practically wall hacks (when close) or a compass (when far away) that tells you where the enemy Jäger is.

Minor complaints: 
-The cover art shows this massive D-Day landing with all these allied troops behind you. In game, you never fight alongside Allied infantry, or see so much as 2 allied infantrymen together. 

-AI is incompetent, German Snipers will stay ""in combat"" and shoot at a wall if it is in the last known direction of the Allied Sniper.

-How do you manage to mislabel a German Panther tank a Tiger in a game with this much funding. This is one mistake of many that big developers making a World War 2 game should not be making.",1658961148,1658961148,False,3,0,0.489587932825088501,0,True,False,False

One thing of note that I completely didn't expect:

I was hiding in some tall grass near an open gate between hedges to a road.  On the other side was a guard I wanted to get near me so I could incap them.  I tossed a bottle behind the hedge getting the guard's attention.  As he walked over, crossing the road, an oncoming transport's headlights shown on him and honked their horn.  He started, apparently surprised and jumped back onto the original side of the road and went about his business!

Sometimes it can feel confining or arbitrary - why do I have to walk 200m down a shin-high stone wall to enter a field, or only climb perfectly things with perfectly flat edges? The flip side of that is that it gives Rebellion a chance to control the experience, to funnel you this way or that, and give you the limited-yet-fun options they've dictated for a given encounter.

There's solid, satisfying action here, and once it starts to click, the limitations are liberating, unlike what I find can happen in open worlds or even immersive sims where I'm always wondering if I ""played it wrong."" Though there's lots of weapon variety, relatively lean set of overall options - loud, quiet, distant, close, traps - make what's there gratifying. 

A little more disappointing is some general jankiness - world objects that are extremely particular about where you are in space to interact with them, enemies that get stuck in alert-investigating-cancelled-alert loops. This last is especially bothersome because despite a huge, rich set of accesibility and difficulty controls, the HUD options are terribly limited. You get quest markers and enemy tagging and status updates (alert, investigating, etc) and tool tips and etc etc or you get nothing - no option just to have, say, a few essentials on the screen and leave the rest of it up to the thrill of the hunt. I might remember wrongly but I'm pretty sure that this is a regression from SE4. 

The menus are also a terrible modern design paradigm where everything is tiles, and there's no simple way to just resume your campaign. It's not a touch interface; I don't need 5cm x 5cm block of screen to resume my campaign. 

I wish it leaned more into the eponymous sniping - it's so rewarding, especially as you dial down assists. This game seems less confident than SE4, though, and does have habit of clearly blocking lines of sight, or tucking enemies into places that you can't engage except at close range. Speaking of things to lean *out* of, Carl talks too much and this game doesn't need (or at least do well with) the cutscenes, in writing or execution. If you want soulful Nazi-hunting, go play the new Wolfensteins. SE5 I think has aspirations but can't meet them.

It's all still worth it though, and so refreshing that, even if a bit less confident than the one before, is still proudly what it is; a schlocky, shooty power fantasy that is fun to play. Turning off all the assists, sitting 800m out from a target and nailing that shot is something that no other game does or has replicated.

Edit 26 July to add: Rebellion has implemented the Shooting Range feature, which is so so helpful to learn to place your shots. Glad to have it back for SE5, thanks Rebellion!",1656109374,1658874977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest change is the idea of invasions -- other players busting down your door mid-game, usually as you’re carefully infiltrating a nazi mansion, or gunning down a blockade. Always a little inopportunely. Always a little too frequently. And always a serious monkey wrench in your machinery.

I love it. It fits the rest of the ethos perfectly. These games have always been about embracing a bit of chaos. Sure, it disturbs the otherwise meticulous and predictable gameplay. But it’s all about being allowed to play and improvise. It’s not really a puzzle, even if you can treat it as one. But you can throw caution to the wind too. 

You’re allowed to bring out the big guns one moment, and recede into the darkness the next. No one makes you feel bad, or lectures you about how to play. In fact, the game implores you to explore both its world and all the mechanisms and systems.

Invasions embrace that, turning games into heart-throbbing cat-and-mouse rounds. Both parties with itchy trigger fingers; knowing full-well that every missed shot, unnatural movement, or revealing glare from your scope gives you away. It’s tense. It’s fun. But it’s also a serious distraction and padding to your overall play time -- for better or for worse.

Recommended, if you enjoy Sniper Elite.

The current game I can't really recommend, loads of the killcams (especially headshots) are very buggy. If you land a head shot, more likely than not the camera will zoom into the brain and have it jiggle around a tiny but without being able to see the rest of the damage inflicted to the head. There is also this odd bug where in the kill cams, the jaws of characters are shoved upwards into the upper jaw looking really strange. Missions say that they are ""open"" and they kind of are, for the most part theres only 2 or 3 routes to go forwards in each lvl. The main issue I have is the ""weapon customization"" and the fact that the rest of the starting points aren't unlocked til after you finish the map. On top of this, these new infiltration positions aren't even implemented that well, with one of them being next to a road where the ai can immediately spot you on harder difficulties (mission 6 liberation). I'd say that around a quarter of the lvls aren't really good Sniper lvls, this is more of a ww2 Sam Fisher experience. The handful of missions I enjoyed left me distracted with the new weapon attachments system. There are only a small selection of ww2 guns that actually have suppressors, the list goes as follows and are extremely rare. 1. Walther PPK and PP, Erma EMP, G43, K98K, STG-44, Beretta 1934 Pistol, Nagant 1885 revolver, Nagant 91/30 Rifle, Tokarev TT-33, Welrod, .22 caliber Winchester M74 rifle, De Lisle Carbine, Sten MK2, Webly & Scott .25 Pistol, Silenced Standard H-D Pistols, Thompson M1, M3 sub-machine gun, Winchester M74. Seeing other weapons with extended magazines, wire stocks, compensators, ect is very immersion breaking. I am very glad that they fixed the Bullet Drop and Wind Adjustment aim reticle from 4, and made it actually work properly. I get it, the weapon attachments are supposed to add customization and other ""fun gameplay elements"" but you can make it so they are historically accurate, like being able to Modify a PPSH 41 into the PPSH 43, ect.

Five years on since Sniper Elite 4 was released and you bring out an almost duplicate game now in Sniper Elite 5, but with more flowers and some freakish AI spawning mechanism that teleports endless AI's into your battle zone. Why? What the hell have you been doing for the last half decade??

If I had anything nice to say, it would be on the improved graphics, the lush scenery, the attention to detail of the buildings and their decor, the dev team's creativity on the cool looking wall posters (thumbs up to Ricardo and co), but that's about it. As for the actual gameplay and gamer/user experience, it's like the Face Off movie but for video games.... same body, different look. The maps control where you can and can't go which is just stupid! What ever happened to the open world style that you gave us in SE4? Also, I can climb a wall like a superhero, but I can't step over a 2-foot fence? The AI is almost laughable too. On easier modes, you secretly kill one guard and the rest follow one by one to the exact same spot which takes out any sort of challenge at all. On some of the harder modes, if you happen to get spotted, well, you realise that you cannot hide anywhere because it is almost as if the game tells the AI where you are located.... all the time (even if you run away and hide)..... and the experience turns into an all out shoot-em-up just to avoid being chased (so much for trying to be stealthy and hiding and stuff). 

The game is a bit clunky/buggy too as I often find myself trying to almost step over a table in order for the game to recognise that I am trying to pick up a gun/bottle/important papers etc. And what happened to the Playstation button config? I am using a PS5 controller on PC through Steam and all I see is Xbox button configs during game play. My same gaming set up works fine with Sniper Elite 4 showing PS buttons, but now with Sniper Elite 5, they only show Xbox buttons (why would you do this to your PS on PC gaming fans??). 

The levels are longer and that's great! But the game mechanism and gamer experience to take out AI is extremely repetitive and becomes almost a dragging bore by the 2nd mission, it is just more of the same. Unless you are a professional historian who will appreciate the different array of available old guns (which all sound exactly the same, I might add), the game is simply a longer barrage of SE4 but without the sniping ability (because like, AI sort of know where you are now and so you pretty much have to turn into Rambo of some sort and shoot your way out). 

So, for players who are looking for that kind of experience, they'll probably be ok with paying the AU$70 for this. But, for the avid SE fan who has enjoyed your series since the beginning and looking for something new and exciting, will most likely be disappointed (like myself) in the overall game play and user experience, wondering what the hell Rebellion was thinking when they put this into production.",1653708390,1658842933,False,211,6,0.753303408622741699,10,True,False,False

SE5 didn't surpass SE4 and seemed like a downgrade with less weapon selection. I've done 1 play through on Medium difficulty using a PS4 controller. No online play yet. The Bad: I missed the tripwires. The entire weapon selection seems to have been downgraded from SE4. Temp weapons option was a good idea for small arms and rifles, but doesn't work well for anti-armored vehicle weapons. A lot of jank when trying to pick up items or navigate ladders. The overall story was underwhelming, especially considering the setting. SE isn't a story heavy game but SE4 engaged me a lot more with the various factions involved. SE5 was underwhelming and was a bit off. The Good: The burnt out urban hellscape of Level 8 was wonderful. Level design in general had some nice variation and challenges. 
Hoping the game will grow on me and updates/Season Pass will add more weapons.

  - lots of content: 10 huge maps - really huge
  - the game seems to have been designed for stealth and the gameplay is good. Not hitman good, but still really good
   - the graphics and athmoshere are superb. Maps are great
   - you can save and load games any times you want, trying anything new and have maximum fun

What I don't like:
   - guns are almost never a good idea. All gunshots are heared from some distance, even if you use a silencer and subsonic rounds. Pretty much all the time I tried a gun, I found myself swarmed by enemies. The only time I did succesfully were isolated enemies which I could have easily takes out silently anyway. For a game called sniper elite, sniper guns sure are useless.
    - in the first 15 hours of gameplay I already encountered 2 game breaking bugs that completly ruined what would have otherwise been a perfect stealth run: one weapon got stuck infinitly reloading the subsonic rounds, rendering it useless (even after loading the game again)  and another one where bodies despawed after loading the game, yet somehow enemies kept seeing and going to them and then raised alarms. There was nothing I could do because I couldn't see the dead bodies
    - when it comes to stealth gameplay you only have some bottles you can throw as a distraction, and some accident kills by shooting objects that can drop down, and that's it. Kinda thin. You can't setup more elaborated accidents or take disguises. Not even a dropped weapon will distract the AI.
    - the game seems to encourage to tag enemies and not kill them, which is very unnatural considering that unlike in the Hitman series, you are not dealing with innocent bystanders here",1658736372,1658736372,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,False

If steam would've added option to add mixed review i would post it as a mixed review because game is overall good,optimisation is pretty good,gameplay is still the same and good like in older Sniper Elite games but it's slightly changed in some places for better,in my opinion it's better than Sniper Elite 4 BUT at the time i'm writing this review it's missing some features like No sprint crounching that was present in Sniper Elite 4,No DLSS support or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 they instead used AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 that is pretty bad compared to DLSS or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0.

Update:
I removed things from missing features section that they didn't added like Fov Slider and toggle to aim because they added those in update still they didn't implemented DLSS or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 and sprint crounching from Sniper Elite 4 and main menu music is still the same generic one it's a improvement for sure but i will not change my review from bad to good until they add/fix features listed above.",1653564824,1658708553,False,7,0,0.436252743005752563,1,True,False,False

* The game feels very arcadey, meaning it have tons of invisible walls, small rocks and hedges that you just cannot pass. It feels far less open world than SE4. You are very much stuck to one or two paths.

* The fluffing ladders from SE4 is still in. You just automatically grab a ladder when you don't want it and you can never climb one when you want to.

* Very often you have to stand up to pick something up and you frequently pick up things you don't want to pick up (at least you don't drop your stuff at random like in SE4).

* Even if you kill all the winesses in your vicinity the marker for ""last seen location"" is still on you and 15 new ai is coming your way. This makes it more of a combat-oriented shooter than a sneaky sniper game.

* Very often the notification that you are about to be discovered is never there. From nowhere you are just suddenly shot. It is also a lot harder to discover ai than SE4 (not necessarily bad) and the minimap is very imprecise  - sometimes it looks like ai is extremely close and then you realize they are far away.

* Some of the objectives are very unclear and the markers does not help.

* SE4 was a better game overall than SE5, but SE5 have very much content (you spend hours on each mission).",1658522291,1658619158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is very good. Only thing that really sticks like a sore thumb is to many closed off sections and routes on maps. Speaking of maps, some are better than others. Spy Academy (the one with the huge castle in all the promos) is by far the best (in the whole series). I like this kind of maps, open, in beautiful sunny day, lots of great positions for sniper nests and long shots. Not really fond of dark night maps in crowded towns or scrapyards. 

Infiltration mode is hell of a fun, except for the first 4 minutes until the phones become available, during which you are just wasting time sneaking around because maps are huge and finding enemy player before that is just pure luck. 

What really surprised me is multiplayer. It's crazy good fun. Again some maps are better than others. ""Landing site"" is the best while the one in the german alps is the worst (too crowded with houses). Finally unlocked Gewehr (best rifle in the game if you ask me) for MP and I'm having a blast, that is, when console players don't one shot me behind cover with their modded controllers. 

Yes you can turn off cross play, but then you get absolutely no servers. Rebellion really needs to fix that. Because it is loosing it's PC base really fast. 

*There needs to be an update to PC version, that sets cross play OFF by default*

in-depth review for any of you interested, if you're new to the Sniper Elite games or a returning fan this game is a must buy for you and I want to start out with what I think are Sniper Elite 5's strongest features.

Top feature for me is the campaign maps as they are phenomenal to me with such a high standard for detail as it's not like they are just large, expansive maps that are full of just empty fields or void buildings as all of the maps have amazing structure to them and every map is very unique even down to the architecture of them as you go from very various settings that all are a breathe of fresh air and I didn't once think a maps designs were repetitive at all. They are very in-depth maps as each map can take you anywhere from 45 minutes or 2 hours to fully explore depending on your play style and how you approach them.

Second best feature for me is Axis Invasion, an optional feature that takes inspiration from the Dark Souls series where a German player can invade your campaign game and put even more pressure on you, or you can be the Axis Sniper and hunt down players in the campaign. It's an extremely refreshing idea and is very addictive on both sides and this is boosted by my previous comments on how good the maps are. If you are the Allied sniper and get invaded it pumps the adrenaline to 10 as you start staring at all the NPC axis guards to spot out the invading player. I really hope they expand on this feature more.

Third feature for me is the gun play in general, the customisation in guns and their variety while not a vast expansive list is still big enough to make you switch out and try different weapons. It gives you a reason to also explore the maps and try to find all the places to unlock said customisation. 

Some of the cons I will mention is while they maps are very good and expansive it can seem like you've become less of an Elite sniper and more of a stealthy infiltrator as it can feel like you're playing a Hitman game sneaking around tight areas and stealth executing or knocking them out but it does give a bit of variety rather than being able to sit from a high-point and take every enemy out. 

The story is also on the rocky side as the main protagonist ""Karl"" seems to be voice acted like he's a 80's action hero and the cutscenes can be a bit questionable at times but you bought this game to see rifle bullets go through skulls and crotches in X-ray vision so the Story can be a background feature.",1658533786,1658533786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My main gripes so far is that the maps are cut into sections with way too much unpassable foliage and terrain, so you always need to take small paths and main roads. More open map design would have been nice. My other thing is kind of small but still annoying; Sometimes when you Invade someone the game matches you with a player who has already done the mission and is just about the extract, giving you absolutely NO chance of getting them before they're out.

Other than that, satisfying and fun stealth sniping with many many ways to play according to your own style and mood. Probably insane replay value because of that and a lot of collectibles for those who like that kind of stuff :)",1658320650,1658320650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As it is - it's full of bugs: Player characters getting stuck in endless animation loops. Enemies falling through the world and still showing up on the map. Shooting dudes and watching a detailed X-ray camera of their head exploding - only to then watch them finish climbing over a wall and walk off. Options in the menu for a melee X-ray camera, that just plain hasn't been put into the game at all.

As it is - It's pretty fun. Like a less polished Sniper Elite 4, only with less weapons, a worse Survival mode, and a MUCH better campaign. 

As it is -  Every update makes it a lot better than it was on release.

As it is -  It's not worth getting over Sniper Elite 4, which is  the same game, only with a lot more content for a lot less money.

So unfortunately, as an early adopter, to get my moneys worth, I've got to play a shit version of a game that will eventually be good...

For my taste, sniper elite 5 is a solid step in the direction I was hungering for when playing the previous ones.  the truth is a sniper isn't only a long range specialist.  they are the bees knees of warfare, the only thing more deep into this world would probably be navy seals.

🔊 The sound is better than 4. I like the random things the characters say, some even sound excited they found you 😆 There are times the sound is delayed ⏳ or plays when it shouldn't which can be distracting (less immersive), thinking there is something there that isn't or miss someone that was. I played authentic first and this made it even harder.

🗡️The single player was fun. I like that you can start from different locations. 🏕️ ⛺ It is also fun that there are so many ways to achieved the same thing. The DLC mountain in the Alps 🏔️ is extra fun 😎 too.
I like the long shot challenges 🔭 yet some seem impossible. One I looked up on YouTube 🎬 and it ended up being you had to shoot through some bushes, so you couldn't see what you were shooting at (and in authentic almost impossible). There may be another way that doesn't require this, but I couldn't find one.

⚔️Multiplayer can be fun but you have to find a good group of player to play with. The maps were far better designed than the single player as far a glitches, yet they are smaller and designed for multiplayer so they should be. I have still yet to find glitches, yet some have. The players who play better or play more are rewarded with perks 📦 that make it easier for them to play. This makes it a bit off balanced and the other players can't figure out how one player can be so superior that they get yelled at, called a cheat 🤨, and/or kicked. I would suggest only cosmetic perks or allow single player perks to carry over to multiplayer to fix the unbalance. ⚖️ Also if they had dedicated servers instead of player hosting individually those players who constantly leave and come back un-muted 🤐 just to troll 👹 could be banned 🚫 or at least kicked for a whole game.

🐞There are still many bugs, even though they have fixed many and seem to continue where things have been reported. When in prone walking up stairs or hills you end of having to stand, thus revealing yourself. There a few places where you hang then can't drop or climb back up, so you have to load a save. One place I dropped of a hill and was falling forever, it wasn't until an enemy shot me that I could do anything. There are times the AI doesn't know what to do so they run in place or sit there just waiting to be shot. I believe there is a glitch with snipers randomly shooting after the are aware of you instead of targeting you. There was one level a vehicle was moving on it's side instead of it's wheels. In Co-Op twice weapons have been stuck in a reloading loop 🔄 so you can't use that weapon type. So far only the machine gun and pistol, never happened to my sniper.

🩸I think it's also a bit too much the detail on the kills. I don't mind it sometimes, but wish I could reduce some of it sometimes 🔪, especially when trying to use melee kills sneaking around.

💲 Overall I believe it was worth it, because of the campaign. The axis invasion add a new type of fun/challenge. The levels are much bigger and more detail than 4.",1655176706,1658090541,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The sniper rifles are very weird and visually boring  but I like the names Gewehr and such. They play the same and the scopes aren't different from one another, I like the wooden ww1 style body which gives them a quality appearance compared to modern rifles.
The machine guns are my favorite as they even though out of place in a sniper game are very funnnnn.. I enjoyed trying out every single model.
The handguns are second best even though I found myself using them alllll the time, way too much since this should be sniper elite not silenced handgun CQC elite. This makes the game not as elite as it could've been.

Still sniper elite has sooooo much potential...

Graphically the game is 2022 quality standards! 
I loooooooooveee the maps, they're one of the best I've played ever, and I've tons of stealth since playstation 2. Expansive, indoors are done spectacularly even as they're missing more objects. I found myslef lost allll the time expecting a lesser experience. The French architecture is beautiful and gives it a grande atmospheric vibe.

Overall the game is done excellently even if its not as fun because there's less sniping and more running around and sneaking to get to your target when they're wayyy too deep in the map to ever get to them in appropriate time. Sniper elite v2 on playstation 3 was much more sniper like and more worthy of the title sniper elite, the developers must focus on that to keep their brand image going well.",1657801826,1657801826,True,1,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,True,False

When you finally do get into one about 80% of the players will wuss out and end it straight away, not sure why they don't just turn off invasions if they are not going to play them but either way no fun match no reward here. So on to the remaining 20%, of these a fair number will get killed by guards in the map and you get [b] ZERO [/b] credit for that even after waiting 30 minutes just to get into the match, infuriating when its actually been a good game for a bit just it have it end there.

The levels are really well designed, interesting to explore, and the plot is engaging. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and the French countryside setting adds greatly with luscious flower fields, pristine castles, hanging gardens, war torn streets, and mysterious German bunkers to name a few. The customization and weapon variety is just enough to add an extra layer of depth to delve into, making you want to find all the parts and collectibles that you missed on earlier missions. The new axis invasion mechanic is also very stressful but rewarding forcing you into outsmarting other players. It adds a whole other element that completely changes how Sniper Elite is played, and invading other player's worlds is 10 times more satisfying with cosmetic unlocks as your progress. 

The survival system they added is also tons of fun having to face down hoards of enemies wielding MP40's to King Tiger Tanks. Each map is wildly different from the last and adds different challenges to defend a command post. The only drawback is that there are only 3 maps currently. The Multiplayer seems well thought out, but was not enough to draw me in, but provided some fun every now and then. 

All these things together this game is an absolute blast and honestly would get a 10/10 from me if it weren't for the bugs. There are several game breaking bugs in the Voice System, the party matching, and the axis invasion. Some have been patched, but many still persist. It's a shame that these tarnish an otherwise amazing game, however they are not nearly enough to push me completely away, because I'll always be back to shoot Nazi's in the balls.

Also, considering that the game requires you to install Anti-Cheat before you can play the game, there is a surprisingly high number of cheaters, and I don't mean good players that could be mistaken for aimbots, but players that can teleport to the other side in no-cross matches and kill everyone. At least this is easily detectable, I don't even want to think about aimbots and radar/x-ray hacks that are virtually undetectable.

But first things first, get DEDICATED SERVERS or severely punish(ban from multiplayer) hosts that leave the game.

[UPDATE]: ESP and Aimbot are currently ubiquitous. Instead of less issues, the game has much, much more cheaters than before; multiplayer is completely unplayable.

Ive put about 30 hours into game so far, on Sniper elite 4 between two systems i have over 1500 hours, and sniper elite 3 i have probably 1000. This game feels like a downgrade to sniper elite 3.5, and not an upgrade to 5. There are some new mechanics, and obviously alot of work went into the map design and such. But there are many elements of this game that frustrate me as a fan of the series. 

1, it has always been a complaint that the AI is either retarded or terminators, and this installment is no exception.

2, bugs, still after weeks of being out has bugs, like hardcore immersion ruining bugs. Infinite reload animation preventing you from shooting, landmines blowing up after successfully disarming them, being seen and shot through walls, nazi steps on your landmine and suddenly the entire map knows exactly which bush youve been hiding in for 5 minutes. Like I dont get it, wasnt those sort of things iron'd out in testing and could you patch it in some kind of quick manner? And the graphics, man, already seem like a downgrade from 4 but textures flicker and strobe out at the worst of times.

3, shots to the face not killing. Like, nazis face is the only thing visable above a brick wall, no helmet, 30 meters, full powered ammo, rifle shot directly to the face, nazi doubles back, just looks surprised, and returns fire. SE#4 was bad for this as well. 

4, no 500m zero? like was that oversite or did somebody go, naw theyll never shoot around 500 meters, lets go from a 400m zero to 600m, so nazi shows up at 527 meters and I gotta kentucky wind the hell out of it because a proper adjustment isnt there. I dont play with the diamond that tells you where to shoot, defeats the point of having to make adjustments in the first place.

5, this game dropped without content that was Pre-ordered and I understood to be released with the game. its not a big thing but a disappointment none the less to see all the hype and buildup and realize its just not there.

6, Clunky movement. The main thing that this game reminds me of SE#3 with is the movement. Its, blocky, fake, exaggerated, and its a game mind you, so forgive some of that, until the movement is what causes you to be spotted constantly, like try to climb over a wall when you have like 5 seconds of time to sneak past a patrol, and hold the space bar just a millisecond too long, well now you are flipping yourself over and over on the wall side to side like a madman, and suddenly you start getting shot.  In SE#4 you had the tenancy to accidentally jump to your death alot, I think the devs Knee jerked the other way and now its almost a mini game to let go of something without hopping back over to the side you just came from 2 or 3 times. 

I love this franchise, but I would give this game a 3 or a 4/10. Based on the previous games, all of which I own, I had higher expectations. Theres some really cool elements for sure, and theres clear work and passion involved in the creation of it. But maybe instead of pursuing the side project of designing and making a board game, we should have focused the next video game instead.


Edit-update 7/11/22-
The gameplay is still horrid. And the fact that this game is 50$ while SE4 is still 60$ should say something. Ive blown way past the 2 hour return mark obviously, and Im committed now to finish the campaign. But after that I dont know if I'll touch it again. I want to love it, I just dont. 

Heres the thing, the maps are beautiful. Gorgeous. Especially the first and third mission. Bravo on that. But my love ends there, the gameplay is lackluster at best, the bugs ruin immersion so bad, and its been out for two months, they've had time to fix some of the major issues. And I am 100% serious when I say, I feel its more broken now than weeks ago when I put it down to give them time to fix it. 

I could care less about the bad animations in cut scenes, bad voice acting, bad animations not lining up with the  bad voice acting, or the random decision to use a black female Irish character being a special ops agent in france in the 40s. Because that checks out. Truth be told, I dont even need the story, never did. Its like porn, yeah theres usually a story there, but thats not why we are here is it? nope. we came to shoot, stab, bludgeon, blow up, crush, and otherwise maim and dismember Nazi scumbags. But its just not fun to do that when you have to constantly reload checkpoints because the game doesn't follow its own rules consistently.

I wish I could upload a screenshot I captured to this review, because it represents the state of the game well IMO. In the screenshot, I was falling thru the map, randomly just fell thru the earth, and guess when the game auto checkpoints? Yep, right there. so reload checkpoint and boom, falling into the abyss and dying again. Now you can load earlier points I know, but its just hilariously bad.

The AI are so dumb and deaf they cant hear a Springfield 1903 rifle shot like 60 yards away, or the bunker next to theirs blow up. But somehow these deaf nazi scumbags can hear a welrod shot at like 50 yards away with subsonic ammo, And pretty much just using a forward charge hand signal to the guy standing next to him, telepathically lets every nazi in the area know down to the blade of grass your boot is touching where you are. Little things break missions in this game, dont skip cutscenes, dont complete certain objectives in certain orders, or the scripting on the AI might bug out and they just stand there like the dumb nazis they are and never move even though you snuck into the room theyre in to watch the meeting they never start no matter how many times you reload save points. I think after I beat the campaign, Ill set it down. Maybe in 6 months Ill come back and it will be great and ill change to thumbs up. But for now I wish I could just tell my younger self not to spend the money on it. Because it wasnt worth the hype.",1653552773,1657519537,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I preferred playing this as a stealth game rather than a sniper game. In that sense, this entry is no doubt the best one yet. Nonlethal approaches are plentiful in ways that previous games lacked - nonlethal takedowns and bullet types are at your disposal and work great. There seems to be a lot of scrutiny towards the new bottle system which replaces the traditional throwing rock. But they are much more versatile - they can distract or even take out enemies, which is really handy. Yes, you have a limit on how many you can carry, but restocks are plenty and I never found I was lacking even as a stealth-heavy player. In past games you would be soft-punished as a nonlethal player. Even if you committed to it and snuck around enemies to progress, the lack of nonlethal takedowns meant you couldn't acquire letters or other collectables enemies keep on them. This problem isn't present in 5. 

This game sometimes gets described as a WW2-themed Metal Gear Solid V. I think it's fairly accurate. Again, nonlethal is encouraged. Maps are open-ended and have lots of enemy patrols you need to watch out for. Like MGSV, non-stealth combat is very enjoyable, so it doesn't feel like you're punished for going loud. Previous Sniper Elite games made combat with SMGs and pistols fairly unsatisfying: enemies felt unresponsive to fire and took way too many shots to kill from anything other than sniper rifles. The animations and time to kill in SE5 make using them a lot more fun, and viable as a playstyle. Each mission ends with a chart showing your performance according to Stealth/Assault, and then Lethal/Nonlethal. It's a small detail, but I felt like it did a great job at presenting other playstyles as legitimate. 

Weapon customisation was something I was sceptical about, but I think it was implemented perfectly. There are lots of options that don't compromise the WW2 look and feel, which is great for me since I personally don't like the more extravagant customisation you see in games like COD: Vanguard (though there are definitely options for that, if that's your thing). What really won me over is the ability to remove the scope on rifles, since I've always preferred the look of a plain rifle with irons. Also great is the option to mount a functional bayonet, making assault/melee playstyles even more fun. Having to acquire these attachments through finding workbenches also gives a fantastic incentive to explore each level more thoroughly than I might have otherwise.",1657428020,1657428020,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

UPDATE: I finished the game so to update my review:

Combat: It's stellar. Not much more to say.

Stealth: It's horrible. Very limited hiding options and not all foliage is created equal. Tall grass will hide you but bushes and tall flowers do not. There's not really any hiding options if the enemy is searching for you, just hope they dont check the room you're in. They also always seem to know the general area you're hiding in even if you relocate. Also because enemies are so spaced out it's difficult to get away from combat because if you fight back it'll alert more enemies. If you run you're guaranteed to run into more enemies.

Ballistics: Awesome as always.

The main reason I'm not recommending this game however is the wokeism. This nonsense has got to stop. I don't mind people of color in video games or women but don't insert them into circumstances where they just don't belong.

the stealth genre has decayed over the years. despite (or more likely because of) all of the interesting, complex and emergent scenarios you can get with bigger maps, better AI, better vision mechanics, etc. the genre has compressed towards very circumscribed ""situations"" that don't or can't interact with each other. two to five dudes follow a scripted pattern, you kill or sneak past, move to next situation. it may as well load a new map because nothing you did matters once you leave the area.  everybody's talking about this shit already.

sniping has also decayed, but honestly what's a sniping video game supposed to look like? it's pretty much a typical stealth game where you have a sniper rifle and sometimes it's your best tool.  often it's not, maybe even usually.  everyone's said this already.

maps are huge and seem open at first but are very on-rails once you get into them. lots of invisible walls, everybody's talked about that already.  let's get to what actually matters.

there are black people in the game, and women, and even black women. i really hate this because there's a softball-sized dent in my brain

the actual thing that matters is the invasion gameplay. it's pretty cool. you spawn as a german guy in another player's game, or a german guy spawns in your game, fight to the death. you can use focus mode to see the enemy's general direction or hear his footsteps when he's close, use ""invasion phones"" on the map to get his exact location (if you're german this pinpoints you too), and so on. german can tag NPCs to see their status for situational awareness.  when it works it's very tense and exciting, when it doesn't it's a lot of running around aimlessly.  just like single-player i find myself rarely actually using the rifle. scope glint is ludicrous, it's like you have a flashlight on the end of your gun. unless you really get the drop on somebody or awp quickscope him once the fight actually starts it inevitably creeps into SMG range. you could use ironsights or the 2x no-glint scope though.

also for clarity, i've seen a few reviews imply there's an assassin's creed element to the invasions where you can pretend to be an NPC. i guess technically if you have the right uniform and just stand there but the animations and mannerisms are different enough anybody paying attention will notice immediately.

the regular team-based multiplayer is a clusterfuck.  

like the other games you get a little lore tidbit for enemies when you mark them. some are evil, some do nice things, it won't stop me from kneecapping them to draw their friends out of cover.  that would be my lore tidbit if i was in the game.

is it bad?  yeah kinda.  is it good?  yeah kinda.  should you get it?  yeah kinda.",1657330462,1657330858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started late with the series and only played SE4 before this. But I preordered SE5 and never regretted it. It is a ton of fun. Yes, all maps could have more NPCs (which for me is the most annoying thing, tbh, because the maps sometimes feel empty; it's just not realistic, that the Nazis would've guarded their most valuable assets with only a few hundred soldiers, which are scattered around the map; this also is the reason, why the game never gets really hectic), and there are still some bugs here and there. But at the end, the game is a ton of fun. Especially the non-lethal ammo makes the game more stealthy and kind of like Hitman, because you now can, if you want, only eliminate the one target, every map has.
My goal right  now is again 100%ing the whole game.

I feel this franchise has confused the idea of what made Sniper elite games so fun. 
The killcams feel dull, and unsatisfying compared to previous installations. 
AI switch from a dumb, unaware state to a blood-doping skill-level once alerted.
The cutscene dialogue is TopGun-grade cringe. 
The weapons have to be unlocked via Kill challenges - and they are nothing special, with the last weapon being a WW1 era weapon. 
As for the unlockable cosmetics, you are the most unconvincing sniper, with a wardrobe of berets, and strange hats. The unlockable characters also look equally boring. 
The addition of  Silencers, whilst making the game feel a little less stale, they break the immersion of a WW2 shooter. 
I haven't tried the non-lethal weapons yet, but it asks the question ""why would you want to do a non-lethal playthrough in a game featuring na@is?""
The game doesn't feel polished, there are bugs and glitches throughout, from faces of constipation in killcams, to guards experiencing delirium and waving at walls. 
My last negative would be it feels like I can play the game with just a knife, the executions are hand-to-hand takedowns are satisfying. 

The multiplayer itself is quite addictive, although you may find one in a few games disconnect as the host leaves. Additionally, the upgrade system is a grind.
The youtube vids of the new invasion mode seem to be quite fun as well for those who want a more adrenaline-filled experience to the single-player campaign (I haven't tried it for myself yet).

The takeaway, please save your money until the game goes on sale. It has it's fun moments, but it's not $/£50-60 worth in it's current state. I just wish that the game would move on from WW2, and into the Korean war or Vietnam war, or maybe something more modern.",1657213326,1657213326,False,2,0,0.503596186637878418,0,True,False,False

The gunplay in this game is miles better compared to SE4. Submachine guns are actually useful in SE5, when in the previous games there were very few moments when it was useful. Invasion mode is thrilling and adds a suspenseful note to an otherwise easy mission. I would often find myself checking every corner and marking every enemy in sight whenever I had invasion mode enabled.
The maps are larger than any previous games, and it shows (especially with the audible ranges that each weapon has, which delineates each type into specific encounters and engagement ranges). 

The story is enjoyable but if you have played previous titles it will seem familiar (bad nazi with big nazi death machine now go kill him and destroy this), but the stealth factor has increased and there are multiple ways to approach targets and zones. AI is the best in the series with groups honing in on your position if you don't move and they will spread out in a search pattern before finally going back into a regular patrol.

The choice of weapons is disappointing, as are the (unrealistic) modifications. Almost all shooting happens at close range (<50m~150m). The storyine, which is for most part a bad ripoff from sniper elite 4, is extremely boring, with predictable and bland punchlines, and it lacks the suspense which was found in the previous installments.

It's fun to go a whole level without alerting anyone, and I honestly don't know what everyone is complaining about.
I have been a long time fan of the Sniper Elite series and I for one enjoyed SE5 just fine.
What I did notice however I will list off,
1. I have yet to find a moment where the nonlethal ammo is useful.
2. Aside from a few bugs here or there, the Multiplayer plays well.
3. survival is awesome but I would like more maps.
4. more maps for the no cross Gamemode because I that was really fun to play but the lack of enviroments kills it.

This is probably the closest I'll ever feel to playing Splinter Cell again, because we know whatever Ubisoft decides to do with the series is going to be lackluster. Sniper Elite gives me the opportunity to be sneaky and I love it. Crouch walking through rubble with my pistol in hand? Heck yeah.

Sniping itself is as glorious and satisfying as I remember. I turned off the assistance and use the scope markers to gauge my shots (The game lets you completely customize the difficulty). This game knows what you want to do and delivers that fantasy. Watching the slow motion bullet cam afterwords is 100% satisfying. Truly a 10/10 experience. 

I LOVE that the game doesn't give you a giant list of objectives when you first load missions. Many are discovered by exploring the map or picking up intel. That's a wonderful way to handle it. Kudos to the devs.

Levels are long and intricate. Most were 90 minute stealth sessions for me. Lots of opportunity to play how I wanted, and that was great.

That said, it's not perfect.

I do wish level designs were a little more varied. There were too many ""remote village with grassy plains and farm houses"" for my liking. This is most likely because they're staying true to the setting, but variety is nice too (Sniper Elite 6 in the Russian Winter, please?). Later levels were a lot of fun, as was infiltrating the castle in mission 3. Also, I would have liked more inclement weather. There were a lot of nice weather days, and I was honestly hoping for more variety to mess with how I would have to line up my shots.

The AI is just ""okay"". It responds to sounds and bodies most of the time. I do miss the days of game enemies putting on armor or more helmets in response to you being seen/bodies discovered. These enemies to try and call in reinforcements, but that's all.


All in all, a solid B+/A- game for me. I had a lot of fun, and if there's more DLC I'll probably come back for it.",1656955804,1656955804,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros

Combat system well implemented and realistic but not too OTT
Weapons choices diverse and made the game able to be tackled in a myriad of ways from out and out ghosting a whole level to killing virtually every Nazi on the map
Excellent XP system which really boosted your chances on missions instead of feeling in some games as if the skills are useless mostly, almost all the skills are extremely useful
Plot and story line good with believable protagonists and antagonists
enjoyable game mechanics which worked well and enabled missions to be done in so many ways from stealthing the whole level and never being seen to out and out running gun battles with almost everyone on the map, and the vehicle combat also was nicely implemented.


Cons

Dialogue a little corny in parts

I like the graphics and the [b]design of the world[/b]. The buildings are nice. Sniping is nice, but not as nice as in Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 1 and 2.
And not a single crash (eat your heart out FarCry 6!)
And a lot of multi player options, so if you are into that, enjoy! I am not a co-op or multi player kind of a player, so I tried it, but really too little to have an opinion on the quality.

[b]BUT[/b] (in decreasing order of frustration):
* [b]Really silly restrictions on moving[/b]. Can't jump a little fence, but it is OK to walk around it. Unpredictable if walls or fence can be crossed. I get it that the game world has to have limits, but I don't get the pointless restrictions.
* [b]Game mechanics are clumsy[/b]. Frequently needing 5 tries to pick stuff up. Getting stuck when trying to move through a space which should not be a problem, until it is. 
* There is a lot of (sometimes close quarter) [b]required combat[/b] and (stealth) melee needed to complete most levels. I am into sniping, not into combat. 
* [b]No humor[/b] whatsoever
* Characters are [b]boring[/b]. And who talks like that? Not anybody [b]I[/b] know...
* [b]AI sucks[/b]. 1 shot and all soldiers are all over you and know exactly where you are. But when searching they run around like headless chickens.
* It is [b]too easy to trap a large number of enemies[/b] by hiding in a room and melee kill every enemy coming past or shooting the one or two who are too quick. The harder the game mod, the easier it is to just kill off a bunch of enemies because they get really aggressive in the harder modes.
* [b]Story is poor[/b]
* [b]I turned off invasion mode[/b]. And after a few tries I also quit playing invasion myself.

In that regard SE5 is very similar to SE4, with improved gunplay borrowed from MGSV, and music and contrived deaths taken from Hitman. The maps are all mostly similar to SE4, some better, some worse. The real star of the show and makes paying $50 for the same game feel worth its price is the invasion mode, which is wonderful to play from either side of the encounter. While its matchmaking times vary wildly, the tense cat and mouse rounds that can ensue for upwards of 20 minutes at a time give a fantastic focused adaptation of Hunt: Showdown's best moments.

SE5 is infinitely more realistic especially the landscape & the weaponry. I have finally earned a terrific trio of silenced rifle, MG & pistol (each with scope) which opens up the game no end.

I really enjoy this game, the combat is fun and the kill cams are rewarding, even though you will probably turn them off after awhile. Multiplayer was a fun grind even though it was very annoying at first, but once I stopped trying to play it as a sit back and snipe type of game, I ended up becoming a monster on the battlefield. Invasion is a super cool game mode and helps add a lot of variety to the campaign mode. The progression systems in Campaign and Multiplayer are very simple, but do impact the game play in relatively minor ways, so even as a new player you are not at a super significant disadvantage, but weapon attachments have to be found in each mission, and those can have a major impact.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Third Person Shooters, Sniper/Stealth game play, the Campaign was very fun, especially on Authentic, which is where the game shines brightest.

This is early access and getting full price for it is breathtaking arrogance of Rebellion. But as the government so is this company greedy unfinished garbage

When I start the steam version it will directly interact with EPIC launcher. For no reason at all. 

Uninstalled this game it is not worth time and effort. 


Patch 27.06
- first of all 47GB for a patch? No go
- second now if you do not move quick enough he is constantly bitching about moving on. After the 50th time it is just annoying
- third after objectives are finished I do not need a comment that this is what needs to happen. It already happend so why do you see the requirement for a pointing things out you already did

After playing the update I must say: Was it too hard for people? Giving soldiers now flashlights at night? Making the protagonist bitch all the time about I get outgunned I need to move? German patrols had red lights not white

A character that constantly insists for stealth? The speech need to adopt to MY play style. If it is LETHAL ASSAULT I do not need to constant move, stealth.......... 

New bugs:

If they classified this as early access fine but a full game release like that...nope

AI Sniper now know where you are and constantly shoot at you regardless if line of sight or not. They just know where you are. Absolute broken

Pistol shots from anywhere: the 1st shot only removes the helmet it is not lethal even I shot him from 2 m away. Animation over functionality again.

Weapon cycling: Animation needs to go through no matter...... In real life I can change my mind devs

I am a dev myself and this is appalling work. the PC version is a disaster

rebellion you created the windows millennium  of sniper elite. What a mess. Disappointing 

Still NO real sniper elite game. Where is the sniping part rebellion? in most missions it is close combat < 50 m. This is more MGS,  Hitman, Commandos but NOT Sniper Elite. Broken shooting system. Still everything interactable blinks in AUTHENTIC. Rebellion waiting on you to introduce to REALITY everything blinking.


Still not recommendable for the asking price
Still not really 9/10 etc more 6/10




In the early version there are too many bugs:

- space is not recognised all the time so unable to skip cut scenes. (Very annoying)
- Falling through the map
- hung in mid air nothing around
- deadlocked AI
- Crashing AI vehicles
- Aiming in Authentic is a joke, just aim and have the line aligned you hit (unrealistic)
- Standing behind a tank sometimes gets you spotted even nobody is facing you
- Authentic still highlights objectives and pickups (VERY VERY realistic)
- collision does not work all  the time
- ""Kill"" challenges are a farce. In order to unlock weapons you have to complete these challenges :(
- Sniper Elite goes Hitman. Now we have wall hacks in sniper elite.
- sniper elite goes Dark souls. To unlock starting points you need to light bonfires..
- typical Console port Controls are improvable
- invisible obstacles 
- Invasion online feature enabled by default (WTF ?????????) Playing SP I DO NOT WANT ANY ONLINE FEATURE BY DEFAULT
- animation before function. It takes up to 2 seconds for a reaction while searching....Again unrealistic (utter rubbish)
- on various maps you get shot at through solid meter thick concrete 
- AI can trace you without ever seeing you
- unable to throw an item when too close to a corpse(WTF?????????) F is used multiple times. Damn  console port sh**
- close combat with a SMG results in 98% in a grenade shot
- Kill challenges can't be completed for unknown reasons. Crush one with a chandelier, you do and f&&& all. Maybe not the correct kind of chandelier
- AI broken when you reload a save file, e.g. one waking up an unconscious body just forgets about or thinks was already done
- tanks just disappear while searching for anti tank weapon 360 degree turn and voila it de-spawned 
- killing Baumann in cement not recognised (50% of kill challenges do NOT trigger)
- K98 locked behind a non-triggerable challenge
- when  you do not kill the targets of a kill challenge  as intended it REMOVES the tick from the challenge even though you completed the challenge before (PATHETIC)
-AI is an absolute joke. AI sometimes just does not kill you no it waits an shots when you are up. In real life while serving I never encountered an enemy that waited patiently for you to get up nor have I ever seen an enemy tracking me through solid walls and behind cover 100rdest of meters away
- Dropping weapons on a slope makes them unusable (can not pick it up anymore)
- invisible roofs/walls
- Racist comments (why did you implement the stereotype about italian soldiers? That is unacceptable but an UK company after Brexit fits this stereotype)

Game breaking:
- Main objectives de-spawn after you searched a body and reload the game the corpse is gone so are keys and codes 
- Main Objective a 222 on the bridge despawns when you go through the right flank and capture all points can not end missing
- New NVidia Driver makes it worse (game crashes now while reloading)
- unskippable reload animation while close combating.......... (Animation over functionality)_
- Grenades are NOT thrown resting in the hands  and are throw  5 - 10  seconds later (frozen animation)
- CAN  NOT RECORD WITH OBS renders the game useless
- endless  loop when a kill challenge  conversation is interrupted just by pressing a button/moving the mouse breaks  the AI completely(PATHETIC) 
- in a firefight  the game plays cutscense and space is then not working.  (OMG)

Solutions:
- Baumann knock  out interact with railing throw him  into the concrete
- Chandelier kill. Highlighted  solution to loosen the chain results in NOT  triggering The chandelier needs shooting (WTF  devs)
- OBS causes the space to not be recognised in cut scenes.

Conclusion:
poorly ported console application  that is not worthy the title sniper elite. In every story mode regardless of difficulty everything interactable is highlighted. In real life I  am waiting for this to happen as well since  Rebellion introduced it  as authentic. A farce. In case you claim to have QCed this NO Fing way. How this made 9/10 etc in magazines beats me. Maybe rebellion paid a fortune to get these reviews.



The game is ok but I think I prefer SE4.

Poor  job from  the devs. Rushed job hardly any QC judging by me just finding bug after bug in 100 h.

No worth the asking price. If on  sale get it but full price get lost

Poorly crafted AI absolute broken. Collision on AI not working in close combat and you ALWAYS have 1 AI that comes up when looting not maybe ALWAYS. What a pathetic result they delivered. Not even worth playing",1654083191,1656689057,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the first couple of missions we did, we already mentioned out loud that the game feels like it needed some more polishing before they launched it, but that can happen and it's only been out for a couple of days. The odd climbing mechanics I can forgive, although it's sometimes confusing that I *can* run off of a random wall and just land, but if I want to run off of a beam in a stable, I have to meticulously hang off of the edge and drop down. Little honorable mention where we both managed to get ourselves stuck in the ground while trying to walk over a ramp (it made us hang off the edge of said ramp into the french dirt). 

These things are managable and probably patchable... BUT, I have some issues with the game as well. 

It feels like the game has been developed to have become more ""Nazi shooting galary number 1944"" (yes, I both mean that it's been done many times before AND that it's the year the game is set in. Thank you, observent reader). The customization is very interesting and I have taken much pleasure into creating (and finding) the most cursed guns on the face of this barren rock floating through space that we call Earth. Just for the reason of showing it off to my gun-nutting friends. 

That being said I feel like I don't need my rifle (as much) anymore since I can slap a scope on a welrod and proceed through the game with not too much of a fuss. And that's a slight issue. Not the customization but the fact that, dispite feeling like massive masochists and playing on the authentic difficulty, after a few missions we were casually walking up to our enemies, taking my sweet 3 seconds to aim at their nutsacks and preventing the birth of more of the nazi youth. I can casually walk through the streets of Mont Saint-Michel where the only annoyance was that sometimes we were invaded. That was the ONLY source of our challenges. And BOY do I have something to say about the invasions. 

I like the concept. You can be interupted mid-mission by an actually scarily good sniper and have an awesome face-off. Where-as the AI is... daft, you might find yourself being outplayed or simply jumped on by someone half a mile away who, wholeheartedly will give you a craniotomy. 

What you're apparently NOT allowed to do is, be a sniper. Maybe you dissagree but hear me out: You play a marksman, you are currently being hunted by a few dozen men and what do you do? I'd set up a few traps, find a nicely defensive possition with high ground and a bunch of windows to poke my barrel out of until I can make short work of my ""hunters"". What happened when I did this during a mission? 
I died, not because I was shot, not because I was stupid (which does happen sometimes, granted), not because of some sort of glitch or mishap... but because the game killed me for ""camping"". Let that sink in for 3 seconds. I am not allowed to stay in the same *building*. The game pinging me after a few minutes is annoying but I can accept it, it's not supposed to become a game of hide-and-seek, but it killed me because I refused to leave my carefully trapped church. Later in the game, when I didn't care anymore, I ran out towards the invader and I was still getting tagged, dispite active searching for the little shit. And guess what? THEY found a defensive position with many an AI soldier to distract me with, hung out in-and-around a tower until I walked up to him. And did they get pinged? Nope. Did they get killed for not leaving their nicely defensive position? Nope. This is a load of bovine manure and I hope they change it. 

There's a last little mention I'd like to do about the special kill-list missions, which are hard to pull of sometimes because the AI just walks around and doesn't really go back to the area we're ""supposed"" to kill them, but that might just be us getting caught too many times. 

All-in-all, I like the game, I'm glad it's out but I'd only really recommend this if you have a friend to hang out with while doing so. Have a good day.

Edit: I'm reading in the update that they actually removed the part where you get kicked/killed for camping. Did not expect that.",1653751286,1656601178,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Now for some critique: the animations sometimes are weird, the side characters boring and the story overall is fairly meh.

Allot more ways to complete missions multiplayer needs a hell of allot of work which is a shame. Anti cheat is a joke and makes game crash often (error 32 where you have to delete the SYN file in easy cheat folder in install to get the game to run again).  Now having played multiplayer a few times I have noticed a small number of players using wall hacks / teleport etc, perhaps have a anti cheat like the old DMV that banns players automatically. Several players also just run around in circles stop then shoot which is a little annoying. Overall have enjoyed the campaign to get to know new abilities and skills. I am a little dismayed that campaign does NOT reward you as much as multiplayer that really needs to be addressed !!! I would rate the game 6-7 / 10 until issues are fixed. Not worth paying full amount / Delux but that's a personal choice. I do like the differing avenues to modify weapons and complete missions with allot of side quests as options. Be sure to save the game often. I have always liked the sniper series so I admit I am a little bias but have tried to be fair here. Love the kill cam whats not to like seeing skulls etc explode.

Just to name a few of my grievances, the game's maps all feel worse than those from SE3 and SE4, all are both far to large yet also too linear. The former might seem like a weird complaint, but the maps in this game feel disjointed, having a few areas surrounded by lots of open space with nothing happening. The first, second and sixth missions are especially bad, having vast flat field with little verticality, and a few very tall positions that turn the mission into a cake-walk. Several improvement from SE4 were also removed, like the ability to sprint while crouched or the small hub areas at the start of each mission, and whats new in SE5, like the ability to look down the sights of any weapon or the useless sniper vision I never used, aren't good. Sniper Elite 5 just feels like a massive downgrade from Sniper Elite 4, having worse maps, less tactical depth and poorly implemented mechanics. If your looking to get into the Sniper Elite series, go play Sniper elite 4 instead. As a fan of the series since Sniper Elite 3, I'm not impressed with rebellion's latest showing. 5/10

The Good:Game play wise this game is top notch and there are modes for everyone! The game has gotten larger and is beautiful and stunning! I love that the multi-player isn't forced! I love that co-op is making a come back! Bring us more of that!

The Bad: Character models & bad acting! Granted Sniper Elite isn't meant to be a movie drama and it isn't to bad. But it could be better. BUGS! Biggest and most annoying is a grenade bug. I will hold the shoulder button and sometimes the game tosses a grenade at my feet ( or three! ). I've also heard of multiplayer cheating, but I've not played multiplayer yet but do know how prolific it is. 

The Ugly: The forced diversity. In WW2 there was a black french unit of Senegalese soldiers and they wore military uniforms. However there were no blacks in the french resistance as they are in this game. I am NOT saying this as a racist or from a place of racism. It is just a FACT. I think this game would have been served better having the co-op players be any race would offer a more realistic approach to a WW2 game.

They have these big maps that you can only go specific ways on. You cant climb over obstacles or explore at all. You literally can't complete a single missions without having to kill multiple people. Terrible Sniper mechanic. 

Even in the Axis invades where you go 1 on 1, you cant stay in one place for too long or it flags your position. Were frakin snipers, we are supposed to camp. Not to mention they are invading your game so you still have to contend with NPC's, you cant just go all Fortnite on them.

Additionally, the queue for Axis games takes for ever. Why you can't get the same rewards if you play your own game with Axis on is stupid. What incentive do you have to let people into your game.

Some maps are large, some are small; you have an adequate tutorial map for basic mechanics for the rest of the game. You get a lot of gameplay if you like the challenge of stealth and are a 100 percent-er that explores everywhere. If you simply want to speed run the game, there is a bit of reward for doing so, e.g. you get something for 1 star, else, you're shorting yourself for the cost of the game.

Lots of bugs with it, though. You'll have cases where it didn't register your hit with a particular weapon, but will with another (same distance and stance). You'll have cases where you set a distraction, but they fix it like 3 feet away, ruining your ability to stealth kill. Auto-saves don't save properly in mission 8 prior to U-boat, bringing you back to before you left, surprisingly. You will crouch, get the ""Pick up"" prompt, but can't crouched, so you have to stand up to pick up eye-level papers.

All can be fixed in time, though. If you like the Sniper Elite franchise, then play it, just make sure your saves are there for when you need to redo something when you hit an aforementioned bug or inadvertently go out of stealth to pick up a paper (or after saving).

It also has replayability with axis invasions which is basically a player invading as a nazi sniper in a players campaign mission but dont worry if u are a pussy you can turn this off but its honestly not bad the game lets u load back to where the invasion started so u dont lose progress like dark souls. you can also do the whole campaign with a friend and do survival or pvp multiplayer which both are pretty good.,1655844471,1655844471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1)  Missions and maps are diverse.
2)  Stealth makes you really think and plan out you approach.
3)  Lots of other weapons can be found in the field (though you can't keep them).
4)  Option to heal before you die helps you stay in the game.
5)  Frequent system autosaves.
6)  Graphics were good if your graphics card will allow you to jack it up some.

Cons:
1)  Some bugs, primarily on movement and picking up items.  I realize the game just came out, and I received my first patch today.
2)  The 5th installment is more of a stealth game than a sniper game.  Use of your sniper rifle in most instances is too loud and will attract multiple enemies.  The maps don't allow opportunities for long-range sniping like previous versions.
3)  The terrain in the maps is hilly and rocky with good sniping spots, but you are blocked from leaving the paths to get a better sniping position.  This can also make you more easily located by enemies.
4)  On some maps you are swarmed by enemies if discovered (15 on 1), but other maps have very few enemies.
5)  Not a fan of the weapon options.  Only 3 of each to choose from (sniper, secondary and pistol).  The upgrade format means you have to complete several missions to improve the guns (ammunition clip size, suppressors, etc.).

Overall, it is a Sniper Elite game and it was enjoyable.  Karl is still a stud.  Going to try it again on Hard.  But I don't feel it is the best in the series, and Rebellion had plenty of time between versions to make it better than Sniper Elite 4.

Update:

Went to Hard difficulty.  No change in shooting mechanics or number of enemies, just in damage taken.  Expected more.

If you don't have a satchel charge, TNT won't replace it to open a door, safe or tank/222,  Very limiting.

I was killed several times when the map would stop me from entering trees or getting behind cover, leaving me out in the open.  Very frustrating.",1654625165,1655811317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
1. Graphics are good, pretty much carbon copy of Sniper Elite 4.
2. Loved the idea of the various weapon customizations, similar to that of Sniper Elite 3 which was a good game for its time back in 2014. 
3. I appreciate the larger wide open maps in this game.
4. Was quite interesting bringing in first person shooting sights for secondaries and pistols which is quite nice and welcoming.
5. Multiplayer is a bit of fun especially Team Deathmatch.
6. Interesting to bring Squad Match in multiplayer. 

Cons:
1. Well this game has quite a bit of bugs at launch and early stages of the game's release, so no surprise there. Examples like killing an enemy in campaign the body is like weirdly seizuring up on the floor before it disappears, or when I was at the time grinding mastery for the Webley revolver there was a bug where after i fired like half my rounds decided to go for an early reload, once I was fully reloaded again the gun wouldn't fire. 
2. Invasion Mode although it sounds interesting, it's just not my thing tbh, I'd rather just want to play campaign solo without having someone join mid-game on German team and just using that phone and go to my location just to pick me off.
3. Focus mode just freaking sucks, like I'd rather prefer the see through the wall binocular movement of the enemy from Sniper Elite 3 and 4. 
4. Certain maps in the campaign like Spy Academy when you enter the urban area, War Factory, Liberation, and Urban Ruins that 8th mission, since the areas aren't as wide open and really tight and compact, plus factor the audible from the shot of rifle even with suppressors, the AI can still hear and like triangulate where you are thus forcing you to relocate around the map. It doesn't feel like a sniping game as in those situations I would rather prefer using the secondary or pistols to just get the job done and advance forward. 
5. There is this one multiplayer map for the No Cross mode called Urban Ruins, the game mode simply doesn't work on that map and for good reason. It's such a small map, that you could barely get a long distance shot out of it. 
6. Can't even crouch sprint no more like Sniper Elite 4, which made it way easier to sneakily move around the wide open map.
7. No more infinite rocks, rather just 4 bottles that the player is limited to and that they have to go around the map to find for.

Overall not a bad game for the few weeks I enjoyed, just not a fan of some of the newer features in Sniper Elite 5, not happy with one of the maps in multiplayer, and the bugs in the game is all.

Beautiful settings and levels that feel distinctly different from SE4 but maintains the soul of the game. 

Minor complains: 
-As climbing is a lot more restrictive in this game, the game feels [i]a little bit[/i] more linear.  You can't really hang/climb most ledges, only the marked ones. It's really not a game ruining thing..just a minor annoyance most of the time. 
-A small handful of minor visual/movement bugs but nothing that seriously impacted game play..simple things that will hopefully be patched over time 

My only ""major"" complaint is 0 day DLC which is not a good look. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering dinner and then getting charged $8 for silverware to eat with. 


Also- this game is free on game pass. Save yourself 50 bucks and play it over a few days with your trial there (15-20 hours to beat the game normally without going all hardcore for achievements).

I am constantly laughing my ass off at the amount of glitches I can find in one sitting that I will be making a video compilation once I beat the game. Like have you tried CLIMBING at all? Because you hold the W key, you get back up the ledge you were trying to hop off of.  Oh yeah, and dead/unconcious bodies load at the same time or before the map does, so every time you load a save, all of those bodies can fall through to the floor below where 30 guys will see it.  That objective you perfectly stealthed over to kill?  If you knock them unconcious, or kill them and not loot what you need before dying, upon reload their BODIES WILL NOT BE THERE, making objectives UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED.

Voice acting is atrocious.  The Nazis blow up your ship and he's just like ""damn nazis."" With no horror.  I got into the armory, and he's just like, ""Sweet, an armory.""  Like it was just, ""next line reading, please.""

You have to make it so that the sniper jager can't hear the host, because your character doesn't seem to shut up.  I knew the exact location of a guy like 3 times because of that, once because he was DOING AN OBJECTIVE.  At least let us have the option to turn it off for ourselves so we can hear footsteps and not him talking about how quick a pistol is or how SMGs are short controlled bursts for the 500th fn time.  Also blaring woke elements, so it's best to just skip cutscenes if seeing a heap of ""strong"" women and black french resistance fighters really ruins the WWII vibe and instead makes it feel like a parody, which the glitches help create.  Honestly, between the woke sh*t, the voice acting, and the bugs, I was keeled over laughing my ass off by the second level.  Upon having a kill target disappear, my laughter had subsided.

Everything feels janky, like you have to wait for player character animations to complete instead of canceling it with another input/animation.  Like with climbing.  Instead, it likes to remember what you pressed during the first animation, then will perform whatever input had been pressed, regardless if you had stopped pressing it or switched to a different input.

Gameplay wise, the game is fun as hell regardless, albeit with some bugs as regards to when prompts should work, like melee kill prompts, especially for the PvP.

And many times, a melee kill results in both of you standing there blocking and punching, in a loop, FOREVER, until you draw a gun and shoot him! Sometimes it takes up to 3 BURSTS to the head with a machine gun to put a man down! And I don't know how many times (lots) I've blown my cover because I couldn't hop over a two foot wall because my guy wasn't perfectly lined up with that wall! And the Kill Hitler DLC is just stupid! In the middle of a firefight, I ran around a corner and ran right into Hitler, like he was just another soldier, boom, mission accomplished!
This game feels unfinished, like they rushed it!
All I really wanted, basically  was Sniper Elite 4 with more missions and maybe updated graphics, but instead, they decided to ""improve"" it! The CO-OP servers are wonky as Hell, and kicks my friend several times before we're able to finally play! All of these issues can be fixed through patches/updates, and hopefully they will! But as it stands right now, I cannot recommend a game that frustrates me as bad as this one does!

Pros:
The stealth aspect is fun.  
The locations and scenery feel authentic and immersive
Sounds are great and easy to locate the source especially when near
Sniping is fun and the overall open world planning is great
The environment feel real and alive as Ai is constantly moving and traveling around
Invasions is a unique (to me) option and adds another layer of value to the gameplay

Cons:
AI are a bit dumb in medium or less difficulty.  You can shoot someone right next to them and they react slow and with no real panic
There are a few bugs namely the Kill Steffen Beckendorf task in the first map that can be gliche
The controls on PC are not that intuitive with secondary actions. 

Summary
Fun with lots of replay value and rewards for playing in kill or no kill possibilities.  I feel far more rewarded then punished.  Never feeling rushed.  Very open world with a real world feel.

This game overall was an improvement on the series and I hope they can find additional stories to tell in the future. As for the unique differences compared to the previous, here's what I've noticed:
- Virtually no more grenade kills? Idk if they removed them or the chance of hitting one but I still haven't been able to snipe a grenade on somebody, which I did frequently (maybe too so) in 4
- Vehicle combat is very different now. This actually is one of my few real complaints with the game; they went from a system of being able to snipe out gunners and snipers to ""blow up the back and then shoot the engine a bunch."" At first I was actually wasting resources because I didn't realize once the engine is exposed you just have to shoot it repeatedly until *kaboom*. 
- Much more linear maps overall, compared to Italy you're generally more restricted in this game. More walls you van't vault, more gray areas on your minimap. This coupled with sometimes vague mission instructions left me running back an forth across the several lanes of map to find my objective. (Don't call destroying a radio ""neutralizing defenses"", it's misleading at best. 
- Much better ""quiet"" options in the loadouts. While we don't have really more options than previous games, they've made suppressors more accessible and subsonic ammo a great option on all guns. I really have a wide range of configurations to decide on how loud I want to be. For 4 I actually purchased a DLC just to get the suppressed pistol in it (only quiet option base game is the Welrod) while in this game basically all pistols can. 
- Slow-motion controls are kinda neat if you really wanna get cinematic with your shots. I only wish the slow motion focused more on bullet entry/cavitation and less on after the bullet has passed through, but that's nitpicking. 
- I'm too much of a pussy to do Axis invasion, because I hate pvp in most games, but I'll happily join an easy coop. This is something made easy to use and though connections are tenuous at times it can be a fresh change to play a map through with someone.

There's definitely a lot more polish to be brought to the game. Now with that out of the way:

Bugs:
There seems to be a good chunk full of bugs in my playthrough so far. Karl getting stuck on slight geometry on paths that are clearly meant to be walked through. Being caught on an infinite slide animation because of one stray rock. Enemy bodies completely disappearing when I take them down in tall grass. Animation locks when hugged up on cover. Enemies just not registering the fact that you're right in front of them sometimes. It's a good handful but that being said, I do expect these to be addressed later on and as of right now, none of them feel super game-breaking.

Gameplay:
SE5's big new appeal is having this new hitman-inspired approach to the missions, basically taking SE4's maps and then making them a bit bigger and a lot more open-ended for player agency. It actually works out a lot and makes it feel a lot more fun planning approaches or having a completely different approach to go with the next playthrough. It really does encourage replays of missions and that'll help SE5 in the long run. The new weapon customization is also extremely rewarding and fun to tweak BUT it's completely stunted by two things, a complete lack of weapons to experiment with (there's 15 weapons total, 5 per category) and no shooting range to test out your new build like you could in SE4. Hell, I realized there weren't even any shotguns in the game and that sucked because I LOVED the M30 drilling. Also, they got rid of S-mines and Trip mines and only brought back the Teller mine, we got the Schu mine but that's just a non-lethal mine. Rocks were replaced with bottles (now a limited amount) and added the decoy which is eh. I hope a lot of this is addressed over time but I'm skeptical, though the gameplay is still fun.

Setting:
I think this is SE5's saving grace, the authenticity of WWII is so prevalent here and I absolutely love it. I liked Italy in SE4 but it felt weird for a WWII setting. You are experiencing everything from a German war factory, to the Atlantic Beachhead of Normandy, the Occupied Austrian Alps, to the French Countryside akin to Operation Market Garden, all militarized by the German occupation of the area and it was just so completely atmospheric. The German's have proper loadouts for their time and I found that extremely impressive because it's the entire standard issue equipment for your basic Wehrmacht soldier on the western fronts. Your Jaegars and Vampr Soldiers actually look authentic this time around vs SE4's style of just a basic get uniform. I personally found that to be an extreme nod to historic authenticity. 

Conclusion:
The game is pretty good as is but there's definitely a lot more polish and a lot more content that needs to be added to further reinforces the game's gameplay systems.

Great game for all type of gameplays. Sniper fans and close range gamers going to have fun. 

[b]Graphics: [/b]
The game itself looks gorgeous. I have decent hardware so I turned up the settings. No bugs that I noticed during my play.

The leveldesign is great and maps aare designed for all kind of playhstyles. Sniper player are going to have fun but if you dont want to snipe that is also great when you indoors.

The French Setting is nice but on later levels there are areas/maps similiar to Sniper Elite 2/SE4 which was nice as homage.

[b]Mechanics: [/b]
Now the mechanics ! I have read a lot of review before writing this one criticizing the mechanics and that it doens't feel like a sniper game. Which I can understand but all depends HOW you want to approach the map/enemys. 
I personally found it easier to get the feeling to snipe when I took the stealthy approach to the level/map. Meaning once I understood the general way where to go and  where to took the angles from then I had a lot of fun. Roughly in the middle of the campaign there are few sections which are small indoor areas where it is more difficult to go for snipes. 

In my opinion they find a good balance to keep the core of the sniping/stealth in the center of the franchise while adding some new mechanics(zip-line etc.) to the game. A franchise or developer in that sense obviously just doesn't want to to the same game all the time so I can say they really honour the legacy of the previous games while trying to appeal to new player 

[b] Sound: [/b]
Good Sound and Music.

This is the best Sniper Elite they've made by a long shot (in my opinion). The replay-ability is through the roof. The entire campaign is coop and you can jump in and leave as you please while maintaining your progression and unlocks. It has an almost Hitman like mechanic to the missions where there's several start points and ways you can complete your missions in whatever order you please.

The new 'invasion' mechanic is a god send and give the game the edge it needed. At any point an enemy player can invade your campaign (including coop) and has to hunt you down and kill you or you them. It's a blast.

This is not your normal sniper elite and heres why

Maps : Bigger than any of the series.
Weapons: Very limited even with the road map for season pass users
Attachments: they're cool and okay. Nothing specifically special
Bullet-cams: You end up staring at the exit wound than anything. in SE2-4 you could be satisfied by the bone shattering bullet cams but in sniper elite 5, you trade all of that to see the muscles and more detailed looking character models getting shot. Its not satisfying in this game. Infact bullet cams is why i enjoyed the series but this game is probably the most failed of the series..
Objectives: Really prolonged and poorly explained. Some missions give you a broad objective ""Neutralize enemy defenses"".
Now to the mind of a SE user, you think AAA guns or cannons right? Nope.. You gotta find a crowbar and disable a radio in one of the buildings of a town.

And for the finale of my review....

BUGS: Yes this game has more bugs than Cyberpunk. The amount of times i was shooting at an enemy and a vehicle is also shooting at me just to get a bullet cam or cut scene like an objective for the vehicle to go invisible. Same thing with enemy foot soldiers, they will become invisible, granted they can't harm you though.
Bugs for weapons: You will come across infinite reloading.. Yes it happens.
Bugs for weapons part 2: Me and my buddy were doing challenges to unlock the Karabiner98(Kar98). We did the kill challenge several times just to find out the mission is bugged alone and cannot get the weapon.
Bugged AI movement: Yes more bugs.. so you will come across AI that will break and loop. What i mean by this is some priority targets will get triggered by something like gun shots and will not go back to their coded position for an objective.
Bugged AI triggered status: This one isn't very common but it's more annoying as again me and my friend were doing COOP and we selected a different starting location but upon spawning, the enemies about 100 yards away were already investigating as soon as we spawned. Another time we were doing one of the final missions(8 i think) and had several bugs in combination. We had a triggered AI in investigation mode for about 45 minutes, got combat triggered AI through walls, several invisible enemies and the worst of it all, our objective on the map was in the middle of the room with 2 submarines. when the ACTUAL objective was in a back room which we felt stupid about not checking but they shouldn't say its in a giant room and not actually be there.


So if you are looking for a bug-free game, buy something else im sorry..especially for Sniper-Elite veterans but if you  wanna run and gun and enjoy shooting balls off Nazis then buy the game.

Sidenote bugs:
DLCs: i do not own the Hitler DLC or seasons pass but i have access to the dlc pistol and mission however the mission spawns me in but i fall to my death instantly.

The main issue with AI is that 90% of the time when a grenade is thrown near one or more NPCs, they'll cower where they are and die. They could be standing, walking, running or in a truck. The search pattern the AI uses is questionable as the NPCs will only go so far while when here a noise. Half of the time when I whistle and I'm close, they don't hear me..sometimes they do but they go in a different direction than towards me.

The graphics are fine but I've seen better. My PC has run many AAA games at max settings with no problem with Ray-tracing/DLSS but this game mimics them to a far lesser extend.  The serious weakness with the map is that they don't allow true freedom to roam. There are artificial walls and scrubs that force you down predetermined paths which I hate!

The game is pretty good, I have played through most of the SP, played the invasions, Coop, and MP. All the game modes are good. I particularly like the invasions of the ""Axis Sniper"", it gives the campaign a whole nother feeling, and this fun nervous pressure to find them while not to be killed by AI or the player sniper(s). The Coop levels are hard, lots of people are not good at it lol. The MP is fun, it can be slow, precise shots which are satisfying, or some faster paced gunfights. The game leaves a satisfying fun with you and I get hooked playing for a couple hours. End game content is somewhat slim, but there is a good grind to it all. Not a grind that is overly much either.

Usually I make my reviews a lot longer because I have a lot to talk about, but this one there just isn’t much. If you like sniper elite games, you’ll probably enjoy this one at least a bit, the missions are pretty cool, up until the final mission which is too quick and downright stupid. The characters are incredibly boring, they aren’t voiced well, and their facial expressions look like something out of the Mass Affect Andromeda release. The visuals are sub par, explosions particularly look awful. Some environments look great like the first mission, and the spectacle of loading into them is always good, but there is always something wrong in them like textures that feel like their taken from a PS2 game (I should note I’m playing on all ultra with RTX on).

Overall the game just isn’t very good, I wouldn’t pay more than 20 dollars for it, therefore I cannot recommend it at this time, its not that I hate the game, it’s just that it feels unfinished and for $50 is simply was not worth it in my opinion.

Personally, I bought every Sniper Elite game since the SE V2. I played all of them for like 3-4 hours so I thought this is just one more for the collection and it will sit in my inventory never to be played. This one hits different though. This is going to be a longer review but I wanted to clear things for people who are skeptical like I first was.

How I play the game:
-I play at sharpshooter (medium) difficulty for everything except the sniping which I play at the hardest difficulty Authentic.
-I NEVER engage in combat and play every mission undetected. It takes me approximately 150-200 minutes per mission (usually 90-100% completion for collectibles).
-Sometimes I take 10 minutes just to do recon and learn NPC's paths from a distance before deciding my next move. Also, I ALWAYS hide the bodies or throw them out of sight when possible as to avoid suspicion.
-Sometimes I stay in a corner encircled by NPC's for several minutes just waiting for an opening. I also make use of ALL of the available equipment (70% is bottles/whistle/sticky grenades). 
-If they find a body or I create an explosion and they start investigating I simply plan ahead where to hide and wait it out.
-I really try to stick to the games script and play it as if it was real. Sometimes I even reload a situation if I don't like the outcome or it comes off too unrealistic. 

With that being said, nothing is stopping me to try and snipe everyone or run and gun in with my smg... But I just find it so much more satisfying when your have to work for every kill. Also that way, the x-ray cam when you finally have the opportunity for a long shot never gets old!

LOADOUT:
-Springfield M.1903 with attachments that maximize long range shooting (reduce bullet drop and add power). I also use the silencer that doesn't affect bullet drop (gun is audible from 87m).
-The rest doesn't really matter lol. But I usually use a silenced pistol and silenced smg.

1st negative point I saw in the reviews: You have to play online to unlock certain things:
-The only things that you unlock through multiplayer are a couple of COSMETIC skins for the guns and some character skins that you can play in the main story instead of Karl.
-Every other gun/attachment that actually changes the gameplay is unlocked while playing the story.

2nd negative point I saw in the reviews: You get less xp when you turn off Invasion mechanic for you campaign. This is true, however:
-The skill tree is like 70% useless in my opinion so xp is really not that important as it is only used to unlock perks.
-When you thoroughly complete each mission, you get more than enough xp to max out the  different skill trees without needing to enable Invasions.
-I am currently on mission 6 and need 2-3 more skill points to max out my skill tree.
-To give you an example, I've only lost like 3 health bars total in all of my 6 missions so far.
-Once I complete the campaign I will try out the Invasion mode to have a change of pace and work towards 100% completion but is really not required to fully enjoy the story and all of the weapons, attachments, etc the game has to offer.

3rd negative point I saw in the reviews: There is not enough sniping from huge distances going on. Instead, game is focused on stealth and sneaking around with pistol.
-Personally I get somewhere between 10-15 long shots (100m-450m), 15-20 short range pistol kills (10m-40m) and like 20-30 takedowns. Tip: when you perform takedowns try to pacify them as it gives you considerably more xp at the end of the mission. 
-Here is the difficult thing : You REALLY have to plan your approach. Sometimes I don't take the cool long shot x-ray cam even though it kills me inside because I know it will screw my whole stealth set up.
-The 3rd mission offers a ton of great opportunities for like 300m-500m shots in the beginning before you start approaching the castle. Just use your binoculars to scout around.

4th negative point I saw in the reviews: There are bugs and you often get stuck on like small ledges.
-Yes you do get stuck on some stupid small rubble sometimes but you just go around it or find another path because the game doesn't want you to go through there. Didn't really affect my gameplay at all.
-There are some bugs that I saw like enemies getting stuck in object or walls. Nothing that prevents you to complete the game properly tho.
-WARNING: In mission 4 (war factory) it took me an hour to complete the kill list target with the special objective (using the rat bomb to kill him). This was the only really annoying bug so far.

I really hope this helps you have a better idea of what to expect from this game! I hope you get to enjoy it as much as I do! :)",1655243751,1655243751,True,206,8,0.911030232906341553,7,True,False,False

2 was linear, but had some nice setpieces, gore, and a focus on sniping, which let it stand out from other WW2 shooters.
3 added bigger maps with different routes between points of interest.
4 had open map design, lots of interesting architecture, and was fun co-op.
5 seems to be a culmination of the previous game's improvements.

Maps are open ended and dense with enemies and terrain. The freedom to move around also means that close combat and melee takedowns are viable and useful. The gore is pleasant as always. There is meaningful gun customization that changes rifles, smgs, and pistols functionally and aesthetically. Coop is back, though I can't speak on its systems without having played it. The new invasions are extremely fun.

Allowing invasions in the campaign game gives extra XP. I played the base campaign solo, and by the last level I had plenty of XP to upgrade all the skills. The game seems balanced around solo XP gain. XP gained by allowing invasions is extra. Unfortunately, many people seem to allow invasions to allow the additional XP gain, but disconnect the moment someone invades. When attempting to invade, maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of players d/c immediately or soon after. Of those who remained, there was a lot of fun to be had. The mechanics support an enjoyable invasion system. Tracking enemy players by gunshots, tagging ally AI to better predict player movement, seeing what objectives are already destroyed on spawn, planting bombs and traps, makes for an exciting and tense game of cat and mouse.

1029690,116972154,76561197960445931,0,2,2543,0,2327,1655347988,"I didn't like it. I have played almost 1200 hours on SE4 and still love the game. SE3 was just about as good and just as fun to play. This game didn't feel like Sniper Elite, other than the one map in the castle. I waited anxiously for the release of this game. I bought it immediately when they opened it for pre-sale and waited the months for it's release since it is definitely my favorite series. I am disappointed. 

Let's first start with the characters: This is WWII in the 1940's. There was a French Resistance and by all means had men and women actively participating in the effort. After all, their country was overrun. Main character of the resistance here was a black woman with a Scottish accent who is obviously not from France. Ah, nothing against that but it is certainly out of place here in the 1940's in WWII. It wasn't believable.  In SE4, it was an Italian woman who's father was leading the resistance in Italy and took over his duties when he went missing - believable and accepted. What were they thinking here? Where are the French men? Hiding in bunkers while the women did the work? Through the entire game did I even hear a French man speak with a French accent? I really have to think back on that. I would like authentic, please. Also, they called him the ""Shadow"" yeah, I heard them call him the ""Desert Ghost"" in one cut scene but the Shadow diminishes the character to be someone else.

Gameplay: It didn't feel like Sniper Elite. It's not a bad game but it doesn't want me to go back and play another 1200 hours. Where are the designers and writers of SE3 and SE4? It is a little bit of an ""open map"" but it is more tunneling type of gameplay than I like for this series. In SE4 you can start the map and go in any direction and complete the maps in so many different ways, stealth, loud, or both. SE5 used too many of the same old tricks in SE4, such as ""turn the valve, create pressure and blow it all up"". A little more originality would have been nice. It felt like rinse and repeat. 

Weapons: Yeah, so many have already commented on how they could have done it better that I don't need to reiterate. 

Skills: I didn't see much benefit from the skills I obtained. More health good - throwing a grenade back that was thrown at me? I never once had the opportunity. A lot of them were useless. 

Rank: 40 is the limit? I reached that before the end of the game. 

Menus: They were a lot more difficult to maneuver through and things lit up for upgrade when no upgrade was available. I'm still confused on some of the selections. Is there a gun based achievement in this game other than attachments? 

Overall: I'm disappointed. I had warned Rebellion on their Discord to not ruin Sniper Elite like they ruined Wolfenstein. If you're going to have a WWII game, in which I love, keep it authentic and if you're your going to turn it into  a wreck like most of the WWII games did, I'm done with Sniper Elite.

What SE5 got right: 
- Moddable/swappable parts for guns
- updated held-breath mechanic
- Removing the ""always know where an enemy is"" bits. I feel the new wide-circle system makes the engagements far more entertaining and challenging
- Crowbar, Bolt-Cutters, Satchel Charges needing to be found in order to be used. This opens the player up to a multitude of different playthrough options per engagement

What SE5 got wrong:
- Simple mechanics. There are SO many ledges under 3ft in this game that cannot be vaulted/mantled where in SE3 or SE4 you could pretty much climb almost everything, OR the game map was built in a way where the only ledges you encounter WERE climbable. 
- Sniper Posts, or lack-there-of. Finding a good spot to snipe from, with or without noise blocking, was an awesome thing in all SE games until now. It feels more like they focused on the objectives rather than the actual gameplay when the gameplay is what made these games fun
- Map Size/Intricacy? Maybe its just me but I truly feel that these maps are smaller than ones in previous games and don't allow for much fun in setting up a sniping position, grouping enemies together, etc. I felt like I was just constantly moving from one objective to the next which really makes this feel more like a combat game than a sniper game. I ended up using my pistol more than any other weapon, nearly twice as much as my actual sniper rifle.... in a sniper game... because of the constant movement. 
- Time. In SE4 I had the option to race through everything, guns out going loud and insane and finishing in under 20 min. OR I could take my time, scope everything out, snipe everything that crossed my path and move on quietly, utilizing the entire environment, taking an hour or so to get through each level. In SE5 it feels like I'm rushed to get through everything. 
- Silly challenges for weapon parts or weapons. need I say more? Just make them available once you reach a certain gun table or find them within the level.

Possible solutions for SE6 (if it happens):
- Start with simple game mechanics. Copy a game like Assassin's Creed where you can climb all walls, you can jump off things onto soft areas, you can hide, you can sneak around. Take those game mechanics and slap the better features of this game on top of it
- More selection in gun modding. I loved what you brought to SE5, however if I look at other games with similar capability, ones like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands takes the cake when it comes to modding your guns. The differences in available scopes or magazines made a huge difference to how you would play any given situation. Also add to that the fact that you needed to find them. I did enjoy a good portion of that with the gun tables in SE5 but it still felt lacking.
- DLC Weapon options. I won't deny, once I've played the game through with the base available options, I like to splurge and buy the super silent weapons or the super loud weapons and see what trouble I can get into with those. That makes the game fun. There simply aren't any of those with this game.

But only fundamental reasons(personal),

1. [b]Firstly, they claim its a sniper game.[/b] Okay. That's good. Now the point is there is no sniping needed, not necessarily. You can do each and everything in authentic without even engaging with your rifle. Now you can hit any enemy with your rifle all you want, but this does not satisfy sniper conditions. I thought a sniper guy comes in handy when cqc is lethal to some extent and a ranger is necessary. These guys just don't know that.

2. [b]Secondly, movement.[/b] I can cope with Karl's movements(even though he sometimes stuck) but what I can't cope with are the npcs. They are weightless robots. The physics is so pathetic. 
[b]Imperfected patrol routes, sometimes they don't evolve or, change. Its like they are stuck.
Imperfected clamping. In the nav. mesh clamp points which is at the end point of the patrol route enemies stops for a moment. The stabilization process is a joke. Humans don't stop somewhere followed by a robot dance and jiggling(not generally). 
Totally worthless enemy response while in a ""just witnessed a kill conditions"" and ""luring"".[/b] 

3. [b]Thirdly, Shooting Mechanics.[/b] The shooting mechanics is glitchy beyond measure(for a one shot one kill guy). Imperfected calibration and damage. They are totally bullet cam dependent. I hit one guy in the head from say over 300m, sometimes he dies sometimes he does not. He dies every damn time if the bullet cam triggers, perfect headshot. If the bullet cam does not trigger, the man never dies though I can clearly see his helmet is going off(AP rounds). So, either there is no difference between AP and normal rounds or, the bullet cam increases the damage to a high degree. Accuracy is a joke. Never saw this in sniper elite 3(which I played the most), ever.

4. I hope I don't have to tell about the bugs?

Sniping is very serious stuff. Congrats Rebellion, you guys convinced me that I should never, yeah NEVER pre-order anything from you. Not to worry though, you'll have plenty of ""experienced players"" lurking around just to get the f5 and Multiplayer. Sorry that I can't like a game which is rich in finding stuff here and there.

As every Sniper Elite has a bit of an identity crisis, this one is no different. The gameplay of Sniper Elite 5 is probably the most hybrid third person shooter gameplay of the whole series. The sniper rifle is still a trusted tool (also the only weapon with optional aim assist) but submachine gun and pistol work almost equally well - and I like that. I like variety in my shooter gameplay and this game gives me enough choices to fill that want. 

The levels of the campaign are beautifully crafted and offer very different combat arenas/sandboxes/sneaking challenges. I've read the critique that many maps don't offer that long shooting distances as in previous installments and while that is certainly true, I don't think it takes away much. You're still able to fight at ranges of 100-200 meters very often and it isnt like you would hit much beyond that without the aim assist. The story is nothing to write home about but that is also not the point of the game. It is written well enough to justify the mission sandboxes you're getting dropped into and for me that is very much sufficient. 

Also, the invasion mode: Before buying the game, I apparently dodged all the announcements about this gamemode and was pleasantly surprised upon discovering it. In this gamemode, you can join the campaign games of other players. You play as an enemy sniper and have to stop the other player. A simple concept that makes each mission way more thrilling for me. I absolutely love getting invaded in a mission and suddenly having to adapt to the new circumstances, because NOW I am facing not only the AI but also a human player that can do almost everything I can do - and can also kill me in one shot. It is really something else and even if you get killed by an invader, you don't really lose progress. You can still save. 

And you can turn it off. You can turn the invasion mode completely off and be done with it. I don't get the negative reviews where the major critique is this gamemode. Just turn it off. You can also kick an invading player from your game session since you are the host (yes, really. I also don't get why you can do this).",1655119398,1655119398,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I prefer single-player campaign and have no opinion on the invasion or the multiplayer mode.  Having played this for 4+ hours at the first review time and 24+ hours for the second review, I have overall enjoyed the game's smoothness, graphics, and I like the improvements over the previous installments.  The game feels even more modern, but still retains the original Sniper Elite characteristics, such as x-ray cameras, bullet ballistics, difficulty levels, and traditional stealth or loud options with multiple ways to progress through each mission, which makes this an all too familiar game and genre.  I have not encountered any crashes, frame rate issues, or errors.

Pros:
- Beautiful scenery and graphics
- Massive levels with multiple approach and tactics
- Different ammo types
- Rifle iron sights and first person view for all weapons
- X-ray camera for all weapons

Cons:
- No crouch-and-run mode (this was a great ability in SE 4)
- No Shooting Range to practice with weapons and earn medals
- Too many invisible walls and inaccessible terrain
- No customization for Karl (no different outfits, jackets, etc., which was great in SE 4)
- No AP or tripwire mines
- Limited distraction objects (SE 4 had unlimited rocks, while SE 5 has limited bottles)

Neutral:
- Silenced weapons are not truly silent, but this keeps the game interesting.
- There is not enough weapons to choose from, and weapon modifications do not make up for this.  SE 4 had more rifles, pistols, and SMG's to select from.

Thank you, Rebellion, for delivering such a great game, but some improvements are definitely worth including in SE 5, especially the crouch-and-run option for stealthy approach.  Perhaps, these will arrive in the future updates or DLCs.

It is extremely easy on SP Campaign, beat it in two days and that is with me taking the time and grabbing all the collectibles. Multiplayer requires some 3rd party anti cheat thing that I am not installing, so I am most likely missing out on any added material from that aspect. The Jäger sniper that someone can join your SP game and hunt you seems like it would be fun but I think it requires that anti cheat, so no. What I do not like about SE5 single player:

- Limited weapons so far and the customization is very underwhelming 
- Maxed out Karl Fairburne to The Shadow in just one play through
- Really miss the way you unlocked gun perks with challenges like in the last game. No real replay value going back using different guns this time. And you can unlock all of Fairburne's perks as you level, there is no skill tree per say... meaning there is no choice or sacrifice you need to make.. you just get it all as you level and its very vanilla
- Not as much cool Sniping opportunities like the previous titles due to map style and placement. More stealth kill oriented situations in my opinion
- Very few tanks this time and no added search parties like this last game when you finish certain objectives
- I have fell through the ground a couple times and had to reload, so there are some unfinished parts you may come across
- Game feels VERY linear this time and most of the maps are just to small to me

Kinda disappointed in this title. I wish I would have waited till it got cheaper and hopefully by then they would have added more content because it desperately needs more something something.

Where were the nests? The setups for long shots? They set the maps up to push you into close quarters combat. You didn't need a rifle just your pistol!
 
1st, Mission 10 should not be a DLC that you have to pay $7 for! It should be included!

2nd, The game forces you to stay on set path. Way too many invisible walls in the middle of the map. Example, there are bushes next to a walkway but you can't get to them to hide if you have to because you will run into an invisible wall at the edge of the path. I also found rock ledges I could not get to that were close to a path because of invisible walls. There were fields, and wooded areas I could not walk through because of invisible walls. There were also times when I would try to run for cover then get trap in a area of no cover by invisible walls in the middle of the map. I the age of open world games there should be NO invisible walls in the middle of the map. I understand that the map has boundaries but not in the middle of a field or wooded area. Don't funnel the player into combat in a Sniper game!

3rd, Hand to hand combat sucks. You get stuck in a loop of pushing ""E""  to stagger the NPC with no real means of fighting other then shooting them. Specking of NPC the AI sucks! Not only are they aimbotts (i.e. shooting through trees and hills) but their dumb.

4th, Mission 9,,,, WTF What happen did they run out of money and stopped paying the devs?? There is so much that could have been done with that mission but what did we get??? ""That's a long shot"",,,,, ""Watch this""!!! Please what a terrible way to end the game!. Sniper Elite 3&4 was much better then this. 

There were other problems I ran into but these 4 were the ones that really got to me. I started mission 10 but had to quit. The invisible walls on that map are just over the top. They completely kill the immersion. I mean I'm at a stone wall and I want to vault over the wall at point ""A"" but I can't. The game won't let me! I have to vault over a few meters away where I will be seen pushing me into combat on the games terms not my terms! As a sniper you engage on your terms not the other way around.

First off let me provide context. I'm most certain an 'older' gamer, and a casual gamer. I have played and completed all the Snipe Elite series, as well as played many other sniper style games.
Did I enjoy this? Yes, Was it worth the money; not sure.
I know many are waxing lyrical about how good this is, but I'll be honest ... I was 'meh'.
On my older rig I'm probably not running at full detail, so can't comment on exactly how good the graphics can be; for me I'm not seeing a massive improvement over SE4.
In terms of game play, there are a few new elements, but overall it is very much more of the same with some tweaks. I didn't feel the game play was markedly different to SE4, to be honest.
I still felt frustrated that my supposedly 'elite' sniper who has years of experience, is still unable to clamber over rocks, move through bushes or step over small walls. In fact, in one map I 'swapped cover' from one side of an open gateway to the other side and promptly got stuck behind a knee-high hedge garden and had to re-load a save. A well known issue for snipers the world over, I'm sure :-|
The enemy AI also doesn't appear to be that much better than before either. I can shoot a guy in the head, right beside his mate, and there might be a bit of 'searching' but not the panic and calling all troops into a search that, I'm sure might happen in real life. Be 'concerned' for a couple of minutes and then ""ah well, no bother, back to guard duty, nothing to see here after all"". Really?
I'd also like to see more missions of having to sneak in and make a kill and extract without any other conflict. One shot, one kill.
Would I buy this game if I knew all the above in advance? Well, probably, because I like tactical stealth sniper style of games. But I'm not altogether convinced it is worth the asking price. If you don't have it already and are curious and not a hard-out fan, then I'd probably wait for a sale. If you are a hrd-out fan, well, then you likely have it already! :)

Pros:
1. At least there's improvement in graphic than previous
2. More weapon customization such as ammo type, muzzle, barrel, mag sizes, scopes, etc.
3. new mode (axis invasion) which allow random player to join your game. (I'm actually neutral for this but it's a new feature)
4. Flare gun is fun (even though you'll get one ammo)

Cons:
1. Too many invisible walls (so what I meant is, as you know there is no jumping in sniper elite game, so we can only vault sandbag or walls. but not all can be vaulted which annoy me a lot. like what's the different?)
2. Not all sniper has 12X scope (It's the only thing that I hate)
3. Sudden lag, usually I get 80 fps, but for no reason it goes down to 30
4. Action delay, like opening doors, looting, cutting bolts. etc

So would I recommend sniper elite 5 to my friend? probably NO. it's super boring after a few times playing just to complete the game.

In addition, I did replay individual missions by myself on authentic to collect any missing medals (we collected collectables during co-op play) while waiting for next co-op session to advance.

I have not played axis invasion, multiplayer or survival... only campaign.

All in all, for what I played, I'd recommend the game and I think it's worth 50 euros.

I did pay the price for the deluxe edition (~80 euros) for it, and even then I'm not disappointed... just dreading to see what kind of dlc I'll be getting for that extra support as dlc nowadays can easily be pretty lackluster.

But that was a risk I was willing to take.

Anyway, here's some pros/cons:
+ good launch experience
+ overall decent technical quality
+ very much like previous installments, which is good
++ map design is impressive
+ fun/enjoyable
+ co-op went overall well
+ sniper rifles are varied and I found some I liked (I prefer long distance)
+ weapon tuning is kinda nice
+ weapon tuning is ok to do only once to suit your playstyle, and not necessary to vary all the time
+ the wolf mountain extra mission was nice
+ overall mood and feel is generally nice

- bugs with co-op that sometimes required loading autosave from earlier parts
- bugs with reloading that required me to get other ammo type to get the weapon usable
- smaller random bugs
- some collectables practically required using online guides to find (may be easier to find on easier difficulties?)
- my fave sniper rifle Mosin Nagant isn't in the game
- the plot and cutscenes are as cringy as one might expect (plot is secondary to me though)
- cannot do axis invasion with selected steam friends, just via random matchmaking

~ sniping of vehicles isn't as fun/cool as it was in Sniper Elite 4 (sniping tank drivers through small windows); on the other hand, vehicles aren't too easily bypassed anymore so it's kinda ok that way too
~ i haven't noticed significant impact from Denuvo, though right after launch my virus protection quarantined the executable
~ i don't know how multiplayer with randoms goes
~ i don't care about comparing real life stuff with this game; one should never mix up fact and fiction... doing that is to me a warning sign of mental health issues

Still, despite its short-comings, I'd say this game is good enough for its 50 euro price tag.

I had fun and played it for over 60 hours, which is pretty good for a recent game release.

It's not perfect for sure, but I believe it's worth the price if you're in the mood for a sniping game.

With the exception of some lagging grenade throwing, melee, and killcam jankiness, the game feels really slick. The gunplay is incredibly tight. It rewards practice and makes you feel like John Wick vs. the nazis. There is a lack of equipment at the moment, but missions and weapons will clearly be added.

Overall, the game is good and will only get better. I will now list my gripes, which define the game for me at the current time.

Removal of trip mines, crouch-running, stuff like that: You suck, Rebellion.

When it comes to difficulty: Authentic mode is kind of a joke. Missions in SE4 are very tough on authentic+ mode. It takes real planning and nerves of steel to beat them. For a combination of many reasons which are tough to fully articulate, anything below authentic in SE5 is a cakewalk. I would say that overall this is a negative.

Level design: My biggest gripe with this iteration. Invisible walls are my least favorite thing about this game. The stupid 3-foot-tall objects and fences that should be easily vaulted and invisible walls are extremely immersion-breaking. Being constantly funneled through chokepoints is awful. The levels appear open but feel much more linear than SE4. It is a shame, because they are absolutely gorgeous. 

The Target: Fuhrer mission feels like a jumbled mess with only a few approaches compared to the gargantuan sub base of SE4. Gives us missions like Deathstorm: Infiltration or the SE4 Target: Fuhrer, please. Whoever console-ized the level design needs to be fired and blacklisted from working in game design ever again. You are part of the problem with modern games.

Multiplayer: No hardcore mode. I don't want to play with magic scope glint and hud markers and stuff like that. I know we can do custom lobbies, but it would be real nice if there was a decent preset for more serious players. And, you released with only 4 maps? - come on now! 

Weapon customization: wow, you can install a little leather decoration to your rifle that will make your aim worse for some weird reason! The customization system needs work, but there is greatness here somewhere.

Otherwise, I pretty much love the game. Fix, please.",1653617205,1654964211,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

So nothing new compare to the old one same bad graphic and same X-Ray effect, same stupid IA and they even remove the grenade that some soldier use to have on they belt, no challenge even on Authentic the game is very simple to play (they called Authentic as they did not have the balls to call it hardcore mode as they knew the IA suck and it still a easy mode even on the highest level) 

Finish the game in 10h max then replay 2 or 3 mission to try get more weapon attachment. 
As the only reason i keep this game to play in Co-0p and AXIS Invasion where i think you could still have some fun in this game with friends or by killing other people who do they Solo mission but even on this they fail.
The server for AXIS invasion are just horrible maybe because i live in Singapore but i get timeout and impossible to do it same for Multiplayer and Co-Op the only thing on why i farm those attachment was for something i cant even play LMAO.

Not wonder they sell it this cheap but really disappointed.

When u use other weapon than the sniper rifle the Nazi are just bullet sponge unless you headshot them, the infiltration kinda suck way too easy, enemy spawn sometime bugs and seems to be infinite which is fun as i reach PHANTOM Level 40 on the second mission thanks to this huge amount of solders the kept on running toward the church and me just killing hundreds and hundreds of them for probably 1h30min and reach max level like this....

Otherwise, the game is perfectly serviceable.  I'll recommend it, but frankly I think Sniper Elite 4 felt tighter and more composed.  The maps in Sniper Elite 5 are larger, and the missions feel a bit slower and longer.  So it all depends on how you like your missions.  I found myself wanting to replay several missions in Sniper Elite 4.  I don't have any strong desire to replay missions in Sniper Elite 5.

if you can wait for the enemies to come close to exploding barrels(yes they still put them into games wow) or trip onto your mine or any of the rigged generators then this is for you.
Even after action has broken out, picking the rushing enemy off the fields is undeniably fun!

two playstyles
1. action jackson, for the ones who cannot wait to chew bubble gum and kick some ass
-> just start shooting, the enemy will come to you ...
2. snipe the bastards asses off:

I started with the first mode as SE4 was sometimes for me a bit boring.
Then after having to fight against whole nazi germany i decided to throw a slow ball.
yes when the alarm is sounded the enemy keeps investigating and sends quite a lot of ordnance
who can all of a sudden trip over your head...

All in all the ways you can fight didi not change from SE4 the whole battlefield just feels a bit more alive as soldiers are passing by in cars or motorcycles, even after 30mins after rigging a generator one stupid nazi still managed to check whats was makng a weird noise, hah that was fun :-)

I'd say 7/10 combining graphics/gameplay/fun
the -3 points come from the sometimes weird character controls(sometimes not moving at all in prone position ??!)

ah forgot one multiplayer:
normal squad deathmatch is relentless but can be fullfilling when you constantly watch your back, need a good team then

I've clocked a lot of hours in 4 cause the game felt AMAZING, every movement had consequence and weight to it but here everything just feels inconsequential especially getting spotted. There is NO feedback for being spotted, just a white line going red with no audio cue or anything.

Credit where credit is due the game looks good, weapon customization is neat, and the maps are ""Expansive"" more on that in a second.

The maps, they are supposedly larger... they don't feel like it. You're given a objective and you have to discover side objectives only it feels bland and just uninteresting, a good comparison is the first mission from SE4. In SE5 you're set loose on a beach with no good vantage points or interesting opportunities for kills, in SE4 on the first mission you get TONS of interesting kills and opportunities including dropping a ammo crate on someones head, you get vantage points all over the place and generators are abundant with those positions. In this game however... yea on mission 1 you're just sorta thrown in without consiquence, there is just nothing interesting about the first mission and its side objectives.

Side objectives, in SE4 they felt like meaningful alternative objectives cause they were openly presented to you with a location. If you got lost in either a main objective or a side one you'd either only have a small area to search or it would be pointed out for you, in SE5 not even damn close. The objectives on mission 1 felt directionless like the radio bunker, to sabotage a generator you need a crowbar which I spent 10 damn minutes looking for. I eventually found it and had to hit a fuse box, there was a objective marker over where I was and one adjacent which just made me PROFOUNDLY confused.

Enemy AI and stealth, SE4 had some of the best stealth mechanics I think any game has ever had. It was unforgiving but fun and concise, AI was not the best by any stretch but it was serviceable especially with how the stealth felt. Shooting felt weighty and purposeful, stealth was slow but tense, and enemies felt aware of their surroundings with good placement in their enviroment. In SE5 you just have random ass patrols wandering around seemingly not knowing what they're doing, stealth is just too fast and just has no weight to it. In SE4 you had audio and music cues for when you were being spotted, searched for, and in combat with each being distinct and telling you exactly what was going on. In SE5 you get generic sniper music constantly that just feels out of place, while also getting no audio cues for stealth.

Weapon customization, this is just a straight upgrade from SE4. Each upgrade is at least slightly grounded in reality and in history itself, it feels rewarding and each upgrade has a tangible effect that feels distinct. Shooting feels the best it ever has, it feels weighty and guttural every time you use a gun without a suppressor, the addition of iron sights as well is just a godsend.

The Invasion mechanic. Okay look I get that its a cool feature but here's my problem, when you have it during the first mission of the game while someone is still trying to learn the game? Yea that's frustrating.

The controls. It just feels scuffed and just awkward, it feels like a call of duty game rather than SE4. Stealth should be slow, methodical, you are a sniper after all and your main tools are... ya know a SNIPER AND STEALTH. In SE5 it just feels limp, it feels like its trying to be a intense multiplayer shooter with stealth mechanics and it just DOES NOT WORK.

In summary, go play SE4 its a far better game despite its flaws.",1654869742,1654869742,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To start with, Sniper Elite 5 is a superior game that continues it´s legacy it gained after the first title. The story is catching and the cutscenes are well made. To be honest, even better than Sniper Elite 4´s. The armory is detailed and highly customizable and you can now add suppressors for example, which was not a thing in SE4. This applies to all guns (except revolvers, WELROD, Shotguns)!

So much for the good, but every leaf has it´s brown side.

Moving on, there are plenty of bugs. In the fifth mission when having to kill the target, there is a ramp where you fall out of the map into the blue-void. If that happens twice, you simply die without ragdolling. There are also plenty of little things like a small delay when entering an activity i.e. the phone in Invasion-Mode.

Nevertheless the fact that this game has just been published polishes these small mistakes and I hope that the above named bugs are fixed in the near future. 

To end my review I would give this game a 7/10, because of it´s superior story and gameplay, but still having some annoying bugs.

Each new version of Sniper Elite has fine tuned the mechanics of the game for the better... until now. I don't know how other people play SE but I play stealthy sniper mode. I take my time. I infiltrate, clear an area with the silenced pistol, set up a sniper nest with something to cover the sound of the shots and terrorize the enemy by picking them off one by one. If I'm detected I either exfiltrate and come at them from another direction or go to ground and wait until the heat dies down, you know, sniper style. This game feels as if it's designed to be more One Man Army CoD like.

Game Play:
I don't know why they felt they had to redesign the AI, but now the enemies are dumber yet more aggressive. They stand around talking to themselves for no reason. They charge and swarm. It becomes a human wave FPS instead of a sniper game. The enemies in SE4 seemed to function pretty logically tactically. Groups had areas they defended, if shooting occured in another area they didn't charge across the map, they stayed in their areas. If they recieved fire they hunkered down tried to identify the direction of the threat then tried to flank it returning fire, moving from cover to cover. These enemies are suicidally brave and mindless. In the second to the last mission in the ruins I was shooting from the end of a street. I miss timed a shoot so it was heard and practically every guy on the map aggro-ed on me. They began pouring down this street. I was shooting so fast I didn't even bother aiming any more. There were 36 guys laying in heaps in front of me at the end of it, THIRTY SIX. I know, I counted them as best I could. There were no tactics involved in that. They just kept running straight at me, ignoring cover, like they were programmed to run straight up to me and shoot me at point blank range with their rifles. 
They don't talk much either. Although like I said they do have conversations with themselves for some reason. In SE4 if they find a dead man they would make comments 'A man's dead!' 'Who is it?' 'Oh my god!' You know, human-like reactions. Yeah, that's gone. 

Let's talk about stuff that's gone.

- Did you like how the aiming reticule would shrink down the longer you held your breath making your aim more precise? That's gone.
- Did you like how you could shoot a grenade on a guys belt and blow him up? That's gone.
- Did you like crouch running from cover to cover to avoid detection? That's gone.
- Did you like throwing rocks to lure guys? That's gone.
- Did you like trying to make that really long shot? Don't expect many opportunities. These maps are mostly cluttered and confined.
- Did you like how you could detect unseen enemies by them clearing their throat, or coughing, or humming to themselves? Well that seems to be gone too.

Story:
The story is pretty dull and feels completely tacked on to try to create a narrative. Some maps have no beginning cut scene just a basic text opening. Some maps feel added on, like they had a map that didn't fit the story but had them and wanted to use them anyway. The D-Day map for one. Black SOE operatives in WWII France? Riiigghhttt. If you want to throw black folks a bone to get them involved why didn't you just have the option to make the sniper black? It's still unlikely but much less unlikely than black spys in 1940s France going unnoticed by the heavily racist Nazis. JS

Graphics:
The textures look much improved, I think they used some filters in SE4 that seem to be missing here. There, done.

Music:
Why does there seem to be generic RPG music in my Sniper Elite game? I finally turned it down to 25% to make it bearable.

Multiplayer:
Not interested, didn't p[ay.


Overall:
This is a somewhat disappointing game that honestly feels like it was designed to appeal to the console market. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is probably the last Sniper Elite game that's going to get made, and it feels like it. It feels like a game only made to take advantage of the player base and name recognition. 

Is Sniper Elite 4 worth $59.99? Yes, I'd say it still is, Still.
Is Sniper Elite 5 worth $49,99?  No, I don't think it is. It's not the game I wanted or hoped for. Wait for a sale and prepare yourself to be disappointed.",1654815651,1654817120,False,2,0,0.50127875804901123,0,True,False,False

After that the game becomes just a repeat of itself - I can even see people doing speedruns of it for fun because of how extremely constricted the  mechanics are. Some examples: ""tall grass"" can make you insible to the eye of God himself, any other vegetation unless the very simplistic enemy ""field of view"" is blocked - not at all. Darkness and or/light (except spotlights) make no difference at all. Or if you blow someone's head off outside of audible weapons range, and another NPC has his back turned and is a few steps away - your kill is ""invisible"" even though his buddy's head just exploded like literally 2 steps away. Or conversely if someone has definitely spotted you and ""combat"" mode appears - lierally anyone can see you anywhere. You can engage in a rambo-style spree, then just hoof it a couple of hundred meters and wait for some time - and all NPCs will reset and just stroll back to initial positions like nothing ever happened. Once all that is understood the game can be played to any absurd extent - like cleaning out an entire huge map of any and all enemy NPCs and getting out without being hit even once,
Besides the extremely simple game mechanics there are the obvious flaws: tanks, and not just some tanks but King Tigers literally roll around wherever they want - on patrols. Like take big circles and or patrol routes - like some basic NPC persons. Literally 70 tons of steel burning fuel away like crazy doing the most basic patrol, stuff that would level half the area IRL... anyway. Oh yes, and the ""sound mask"" basicly means anything loud magically hides your shots... any shots. Except that of course a big german V12 of a tank with no mufflers what so ever makes no such masking sound, while a cement mixer will. 
What else... the maps are gigantic and are clearly made for multiplayer gameplay. Very beautifully done though, but obviously while the artists went all-out to make very detailed gigantic maps people who coded the game just got done with making Doom 1-style AI and game play. If in some previous SE games anemy snipers had xray vision here they have a cane and a guide dog, snipers are probably 1/100th the problem to kill compared to say a group of soldiers in a tight space. Same goes for the most god-awful facial animations and ragdoll lip movements. Weapons are completely over the top with the usual customizaton nonsense like zoom scopes, bullet drop and wind is extremely overdone for the fun of it.",1654816451,1654816451,False,3,0,0.50290977954864502,0,True,False,False

Same as Sniper Elite 4, killing Hitler with a testicle shot is worth it alone.

Anyone can hop into invasion mode and rush down the opposing player with an SMG. Try out snipe the other player or better yet, sneak up melee your opponent? That's fun. 

Multiplayer modes like TDM and Free for all are Okay-ish... nothing special. Fun for a while, only scope in your rifle after you have spotted the glare from another players rifle across the map is the only way to stay alive. Your binoculars are gonna become your best friend.

It reminds me more of the old medal of honor games, where you have to fight your way trough villages and towns which are occupied by the enemy. The only time you really have the chance to use your rifle is at the beginning of the each missing where you are able to scout and snipe away. As soon as you get closer to the center of the map it is quite useless and you will mostly use your silenced pistol or your smg. 

Ok lets talk about the ai for a second, it definitly needs some work. 
For example, i shot a guy next to another guy the guy falls in direction x, the other guy runs for cover. that is fine and expected behavior and the AI does ist quit nicely, but the cover the ai choses exposes his back to me. i mean yeah i run to cover and laylow looking at my dead college and not in the directoion in from which the shot might have come, thats plain an error in programming.

The first thing is the language and voice acting. It's great that German soldiers speak native German, but the actual acting is horrible. Everyone sounds vaguely comical, as if not taking the situation he's in seriously. I have not heard any voice that I could reasonably believe to belong to a real soldier in a serious scenario. There are also literal translations from English expressions in their lines, that aren't proper German, as well as smaller details, like grammar errors in Propaganda Posters.
I know the game had expert advisors on weapons and such, why couldn't they have also had just one or two German people to check for this kind of thing? They would have spotted all of it immediately.

The level design goes for oversimplified Pseudo-German set pieces, like a large sign that just says ""Achtung!"" in the middle of a camp. I get that this is useful for being recognizable by Non-Germans, but that sign makes no sense. ""Achtung!"" for what? There needs to be some explanation on what that sign is a warning against. Especially since German is famous for being very detailed and specific.

I don't want to make this too long, so I'll say this in conclusion. In order for me to enjoy fighting enemies in a game, I have to be able to take them seriously and have respect for them. That is what is lacking here. Even though my complaints may be less problematic for Non-Germans, I'm certain that a more authentic depiction of them would make for a much better game for everyone.

So please, pay more attention (""Achtung!"") to detail when designing villains, antagonists and enemies.",1654779933,1654779992,False,201,42,0.664941549301147461,19,True,False,False

I am english and studdied german as a hobby, grew up in the golden age of ww2 shooters. Quite a delightful game to set me back and possibly the last of the games I will be buying for my collection with that in mind. Family history of WW2 duty and cold war service started me off in gaming as a tool of understanding the times as they might have seen them.

Reading reviews I was on the fence if i was even worth dropping a few coins on it at release, but I can safely say this one will be re-visited when I have time, even after the story is finished.

I don't like certain progression milestones that have interrupted how I would have liked to play the story, but they are a tool of modern conventions and not a problem with the game, unlocks, linearity and AI limitations are certainly factors that time has set in stone. Theres still a lot to offer.

I intended to play the whole game on realistic settings but submitted to easy mode sprint and objective grab after the third mission. A decision I made myself but without a good set of tools to fit my play style one can only decide when there are no better options.

Still, thats just how games work these days, and when im showing future generations what grandad games looked like this will be one of the first i go to, even though there are better games out there in every regard.

Anyway, for a game about sniping there are far few testicles assasinated for my liking in my playthrough. The voice of your protaganist is the loudest noise in the game and can drown out gunfire, sad because it's the most generic example of american retro bravado, good you can turn it down but it's both the charecter that fits the most and the flattest impression in the game at the same time. Fitting really, that it doesn't fit me.

So in terms of playability and replayability the game stands out for being unremarkable in every what it HAS TO, and that make it stand out for every reason that it doesn't need to stand out already, as a game about stealth and options it has the right amount of hand holding and blunt force to succede.

Should you buy? Yes, I only reccomend it to anyone with some patience and a lot of standards to live by, only to be willing to let them slip. 

It's pretty remarkable in it's generics and I find that especially poetic if you couldn't tell already. There's character in it's lack of character for anyone with an eye for detail.

I might even consider going back for SE4, I tried 3 when it came out but hated the way it handled as a PC game, im not a console shooter type, this version NAILED the PC controls for those it matters to, but I can't say im in a rush to find out if 4 had things covered even if reviews came in positive about the general experience.

TL;DR, 5/5 review, perfectly imperfect.

Lots of invisible barriers makes getting around the map a pain.
Half the missions require you to flip switches to overload a machine.
Crowbars and bolt cutters are vital but must be found in mission.
Hugely overpriced for a game that's so easy to complete and lacking in re-playability.

As someone that was NOT a fan of the direction taken in Zombie War, I DO like this game (even though there's no Mosin or trip mines dang it!).  The Axis Invasion is a neat concept that I hope they eventually put in a way to join your friends and not just a random game.

I was really expecting to see some great game play improvements, but they are not there.  I am almost done the campaign and frankly finding it boring.  I am finding the AI so predictable and dumb.  There are some maps where you can pick off a large number of enemies from great distances and all that the enemy AI does is basically run around in circles.  Moving from one cover to another.  When in close quarters it is just as bad.  Hide beside an object, whistle, one enemy comes, stealth take down, whistle for the next enemy to come.  Done missions where I have knocked out all but the assignation target without detection.  Done missions where I have killed everyone without detection.  Started to use the SMG more due to boredom.  I have also found that the player movement is more clunky than previous versions of the game.  

Really disappointed that they have not improved the AI.  This is such a key part to make these games great.  Frankly I am not finding much of a challenge to this game other than going for various ribbons/metals/achievements. 

The environments are beautiful and big.  They have done a great job with this again.

While there isn't a huge list of levels (9 or 10 if you have the DLC) the levels/maps are quite huge with loads of collectables and optional objectives. If your going in silent you'll get at least an hour or so in each level (minus the last level lol).

It's not 100% perfect, there are a few glitches/bugs and such but in the 19 hours I've played so far I've only really ran into 2 bugs that I had to re-load from a save (so either its not too bad, or I'm lucky compared to others). The graphics are nice, it runs great on my system and the X-ray system has been upgraded/improved like they always do in each game (imo).

Some new features are being able to customise your character for both SP and Axis mode, as well a load of options to upgrade and unlock weapons. What is Axis Invasion? It's basically an online mode where you join a random person whos playing the campaign and your mission is to basically kill them and you win (otherwise you get taken out and you lose). If the player is taken out by the other enemies you also win (I am terrible at the mode, but its quite fun). You also get to request a rematch.

I've not attempted the other modes yet but basically finished the game (while taking my time, and not playing it every day) but its quite short to a degree, but as I said I took my time and like to go for the silent approach so I got hours out of the levels myself.

So far, the game is undeniably fun, I just wish there was more freedom when exploring the map. It appears ""open"" however the developers made it so that you can only choose between a few predetermined paths. This does not bother me that much, as the core gameplay experience is exciting and addictive. Hopefully in later levels the map becomes more open.

UPDATE:

This is my first SE game. Over the last few days a lot of my free time has been spent playing this game. Simply put, it is fun! There's a good mix of realism and arcade-y elements which makes it so that it's always a breeze to pick up and play for short or long periods of time. 

I have to add how well optimised this game is. My rig is about 8 years old and it runs between 60-70fps on medium settings.

The MP is surprisingly good. It is slow paced, which I prefer. You can attempt to ""run-and-gun"" however that'll usually end up with a you dying swiftly. Careful positioning and environmental awareness is rewarded handsomely. I have yet to finish the SP campaign because potshotting players is just so much fun honestly. Even just assuming the recon role with your binoculars and marking players is satisfying as you see your team pick off the targets you've marked. The only thing lacking is map selection. Hopefully they'll add more in future updates. I also appreciate how you can host and join custom games with custom rules. 

Currently, I'm on mission 4 in the campaign and I can happily say that the first mission is the most linear. As I progressed the levels seemed to open up more. There are numerous ways to reach and complete your objective. I'll get back to the campaign eventually, once I've had my fill of MP for a while!

Please don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from buying this game. It is well worth your time.

UPDATE 2:

Finished the game on hard and currently playing through on authentic. (mostly co-op with invasions enabled.) Feels like I'm playing a different game to a lot of naysayers. I have encountered a few bugs however some of the points made about the AI being broken I simply have not encountered. They do not see me through terrain and respond according to my visibility (terrain and shadows) and stance. Can't get enough of this game! Invasions are intense and honestly a game changer.

The revolver stops reloading and firing if you use an item. Regular, boring house windows are inexplicably bulletproof. The game is much more finicky about what you can and can't climb over which makes the movement much clunkier and less fluid. There's sound bugs, janky animation transitions, and a whole slew of other issues that really detract from the game. Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed. There's a lot of changes and additions from SE4 that I like (bayonets, first-person iron sights, anti-tank rifles, customization, the new weapon pickup system, etc) but in terms of level design, playability and polish, I think that Sniper Elite 4 was much better.

Now I know we live in a repugnant reality where it's the norm for games to get pushed out slightly broken and be fixed over the course of a few months, instead of being perfected for launch, so I'm sure things will improve in time. That being said, I don't have to be happy about it. I like this game and everything, but in some ways it feels like a step backwards and there's plenty of issues to iron out still. I'm hoping that they tweak the traversal and get rid of all the invisible walls, and they BETTER fix all the other issues.

This is my first review on Steam because I had to set the record straight since I am a fan of this series and have played them all except Sniper Elite VR.  Sniper Elite 4 set the standard in my opinion and Rebellion stayed true with Sniper Elite 5.  27 hours in and I’m loving it as much as I loved Sniper Elite 4.  However, I do miss the trip wire traps...frowns.

Axis Invasions is a nice touch which I am finding a blast (another player joins the Germans to try and stop you during campaign missions).  Yes, you can’t camp once someone invades but this makes sense.  The maps are expansive and if camping was allowed, I could see how frustration could ensue hours after not being able to find your opponent.  I can also see how some of us could enjoy an hours-long hunt.  Perhaps a camp setting that can be turned on or off would be a nice addition to this concept.  As of now you can simply turn Axis Invasions off and camp all you want.  In fact, I suggest turning it off if you are trying to unlock weapons, complete certain tasks, etc.  My plan is to finish levels collect and unlock everything then go back to replay with Axis Invasions on.

Rebellion has added the x-ray cam to all weapons to happen more often as well which is awesome.  For example, if you use your pistol at a certain distance, it almost always jumps into effect.  I’m dropping my two cents because the negative reviews almost turned me off this game.  It was inevitable as a fan that I wouldn’t give it a try anyway so here I am.  My point is that if you really enjoyed Sniper Elite 4, you will enjoy this one and I highly recommend that you give it a chance.

But this is actually decently accurate to how things were at the time. With the French Governement offering citizenship to people willing to fight, this still continues with the French Foreign Legon today. 
The Shooting Mechanics of the game are just as satisfying as players of previous games would remember. 
My only complaint is some lack of polish of some of the buildings. Where I might melee an enemy from a doorway and pull them through the doorframe because of the animation, or be standing inside of a nearby wall. I also have occasionally ran across areas where I might see between textures and seen the sky where I clearly shouldn't.  
Still overall the game is a satisfying experience and the Survival mission (When playing with friends) is fantastic. Can't say I'm a fan of intrusions by other players, but the setting to turn those off is easy enough to find in the settings.",1654632860,1654632860,True,1,0,0.501736104488372803,0,True,False,False

Enemies that stay standing, dead but otherwise untouched, after a grenade to the head; vehicles and bodies disappearing after a few minutes; bodies stuck half under the map, or sticking through walls ; game updates not getting installed; can't untag items; troops in endless ""investigating"" loops . . . I could go on with quite a list, but most has already been covered here at length by other reviewers.

This is basically released in beta form, and I have no idea how this was released in this shape as any of these issues are blatantly obvious with even minimum play-testing . . . either they didn't test it,  didn't give a damn about releasing an unpolished turd, or don't have the talent to figure out the issues.  

Whatever, at this point they don't deserve to be paid for this as it sits . . . maybe after a LOT of fixing. Too bad, because with a bit of proper management this could have been an amazing game.

1. Satisfying gunplay. Sniper rifles aren't the only weapons that feel good to shoot
2. Large and complex maps with lots of places to explore
3. Very detailed slow-time kill cams that allow you to see your bullets pierce through enemies organs
5. Invasion mode is a nice addition to gameplay
6. Enough contents to keep you entertained for at least 30 hours

Cons:
1. The graphics are kinda outdated by today's standard (still acceptable to me though)
2. The anti-aliasing is basically non-existent
3. Only a handful of maps for multiplayer
4. Not enough weapons and no shotguns
