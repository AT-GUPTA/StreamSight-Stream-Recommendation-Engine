I know it has been nerfed and discussed in the past but still - The carribean happiness in comparison to your own island is one of the major factors to determine the chance for reelection. To decrease the steady climb you just have to spam said mission. There are almost no downsides to just perma scedule, so the only real threat for your reign are unhappy factions. 
I mean, why do your neigbours not react to your aggressive actions? Why do I have nothing to pay or deliver to the commando garrison? Why is there a 100% success chance for said mission? (Why does it for example not scale with my military power [in comparison to my neigbours]?) Why is there no downtime (except the collection of enough raid points, which other facilities are able to do even before the current mission has been successful) to reuse it? Why do the progressives on my island not demonstrate against this playstyle (especially if I play in favor of the libs)? etc.

You can choose to be a benevolent ruler or a ruthless dictator, and face the challenges of politics, economics, and diplomacy. The game features a detailed simulation of your citizens, who have their own needs, opinions, and factions. You can also customize your island with various buildings, landmarks, and monuments, and explore a large archipelago with different biomes and resources.

The game has a lot of content and variety, with 15 story missions that have quirky and humorous scenarios, and a sandbox mode that lets you create your own island paradise. The game also supports multiplayer, where you can cooperate or compete with up to four players. The graphics are colorful and vibrant, and the soundtrack is catchy and fitting for the tropical theme.

However, the game is not without flaws. The combat system is weak and simplistic, and the AI can be unpredictable and frustrating. The game can also be overwhelming and confusing at times, as it does not always explain how the different systems and mechanics work, or how to solve the problems that arise.

Overall, Tropico 6 is a fun and addictive game for fans of city builders and simulation games, but it may not appeal to everyone. It has a lot of charm and personality, but it also has some technical issues and design flaws. It is a game that requires patience and experimentation, and rewards creativity and strategy. If you are looking for a game that lets you rule your own island nation, Tropico 6 might be worth a try.",1708902563,1708902563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A dictator making money and alliances with superpowers while your people break their backs in the fields and factories?

Then this game is a good outlet for those desires.

In Tropico 6, you take the role of the ""presidente"" of Tropico, a fictional island nation where your word is law (literally and figuratively). Surrounded by wacky advisors, weirdos from other nations, and the overbearing and very demanding leaders of various political factions; its your job and duty to make Tropico prosper throughout the ages. You are in charge of all of the islands infrastructure; from warehouses and docks, to roads and taverns. The choices are yours to make (as so long as you have the funds).

You make money by having a prosperous economy. Set wages, build money producing buildings, hire workers and if your feeling tyrannical, steal money from your people through direct actions (you'll figure that out on your own).

Dont forget to customize your palace and your prsidente, as looking good is half the PR battle, and visiting buildings filled with workers is the other half. A well loved presidente has nothing to fear ... however, if you are disliked enough you could deal with guerrilla uprisings ... or worse PROTESTERS.

Dont worry though, just bribe them to leave you alone by promising reforms or greasing their palms with cash ... or just send the army to deal with them, after all, your word is law.

And dont forget about your military; they are a fickle bunch of warhawks, and love being spoiled. Upgrade them, arm them, give them power and buildings to play around with, otherwise they might just try to become the NEW presidente's.

To make sure its not just me I checked out the Global Achievements and the number of players that are achieving those achievements in the unmodded game is pathetically low.... So its not just me... 

Now on with my original review. 

I have played every Tropico Game since Tropico 3 extensively and whilst Tropico 5 was the worst one of the lot, Tropico 6 isnt without its own serious problems. 

Tropico 6's margins are so tight it sucks of the fun right out of the game and turns it in to a time sink as you wait for freighters to come in and trade with you. 

Most of the game play is ""waiting"" for that reason. 

You cannot afford to raise wages beyond 3 out 5 because your economy cannot handle it and you cannot drop it below 2/5 because the industry stops working effectively.  Sure you can actually change those, but if you do, your game takes a turn for the worst. 

Population growth is also a serious problem, leading to massive unemployment because you cannot earn money fast enough to pay for buildings and industry needed to shelter them and give them work. 

The various methods of playing eg as a dictator or as a western style president are all there in the game but the 2 issues above mean your never going to be able to enjoy either of those styles because every game you play hits the same problems due to a lack of balance. 

Wind Turbines for example, you would expect a power generation system like that to be cheap to run, as it turns out they are one of the more expensive options, Solar Power being the best option. 

Revolts happen and end without you noticing, so that side of Tropico is a bust too. 

Era transitions are like a ""Brexit Cliff Edge"", when they happen your economy nose dives and you must make immediate changes to save your game before your money runs out or your in serious trouble.

I once spent 50 in game years trying to recover from simply moving to the modern age, i wish i could say that only happened once but its happened in a 100% of my games so far. 

 Even if you did everything right, this always happens. It starts out being a minor problem when moving to the World War era, gets a little worst when moving in to the Cold War era and pretty much puts you in a tail spin when you enter the modern era. 

I got the feeling testers didnt test the games era progression but instead tested each era individually. 

Trying to balance things on your island is extremely difficult because anything that goes wrong can end your game if your not quick to address it. It really can leave you trying to fix things for the next 50 in game years, which usually means sitting in front of your computer screen waiting for freighters to come in and reduce your debt a little. 

Money made and taken away so fast you can get a warning about too much debt one minute and be rolling in the cash the next before its taken away again and your back to the warning. 

I built up a sizeable bank balance several times, the switched eras and watched it all disappear within minutes.

This game has some serious balance issues that nullify other features in this game and that makes it hard to enjoy this game even for a tropico veteran like my self. 

As it stands i cannot recommend this game in its current state, too many of my games have ended the exact same way for me to blame ""unfamiliarity"" anymore.  

The game has potential to become the best Tropico game in the series, but that would involve the devs getting off their butts and reballancing the game properly like they should have done prior to its release. 

Sometimes game developers forget we are paying customers and need a reminder of the customer/company relationship and what happens if a company releases a dodgy product. 

Well this is my reminder.

Fix the balance issues or watch a customer walk away from all your future products. 

This is Tropico's last chance with me.",1555518596,1708542153,False,107,10,0.668084204196929932,0,True,False,False

I will say that this game massively improves the mechanics and balance compared to the 5th. I did really like the campaign missions of the fifth since it followed a cohesive story, but I do still really enjoy the variety of islands and goals we get in the new game.

My recommendation for new players:

Advance as quickly as possible to the modern era. Balance the factions as much as possible (factoring the number of members and the % relationship). When making trade routes, almost always chose the default lowest quantity in order to cycle through them quickly. You can build an extremely effective supply chain economy using forestry. Turn logs into planks for the colonial era, then planks to boats in the WWII era, then planks to furniture in the Cold War. Your forests regenerate naturally so there is no concern for soil degradation (loss of efficiency). Do Not skip out on the Teamster buildings, they're the couriers that bring things from production buildings for refinement, and from refinement to the docks for export (ie the very backbone of your economy).

Once in the modern era, Hydroponics and Factory Farms will be 100% effective without considering the soil quality, so you can manufacture all other products much more effectively. You will need to invest considerably in electricity infrastructure, so make sure that before entering the modern era, that you have investment much time into education (since many of the modern jobs require HS level education) and that you have enough money for ""The Great Modernisation"" of literally all modernisable buildings (plantations, ranches, mines and apartments).

When cycling through trade routes, you'll often find that in the WWII era, Cold War, and modern era your relationship with the Super Powers will be greater than 100 points. When it shows that it is >100, ask for financial assistance (lowers by 20 points, cooldown of 36 months) and so you can general a sort of alternative income from your goodwill with the super powers. If you have both or many super powers with around 90 points, enact the Super Power Super Party (I forget the name) edict which will cost you 20,000$, but you can then get your money back from one super power using financial assistance, and profit from the other(s).

Use the Ministry to strategies what works best for you, but in general, have the Broker minister for all the available positions, and the religious minister for internal (reduces rebels and criminal massively). Having the broker ministers will allow you to passively generate swiss bank money to be used for the broker power ups. Stock up on ""cause a distraction"" and ""convincing talk"" tokens for when the faction demands or ultimatums are either unattainable or you're just flat out done with their BS (I'm looking at you General Rodriguez).

There are quite a few marred and tarnished mechanics in this game
- Generally poor tabulation of your cities statistics. The UI is too cluttered and real data is missing.
- The game does a poor job of communicating some problems. For example, you might have low housing satisfaction because the available housing is too low quality, but the game won't tell you this is the problem and where higher quality housing is in demand. The game also won't communicate why people aren't at their jobs or that you don't have enough partisans to move goods about the map. Stuff just grinds to a halt, your economy nosedives, and you can't pay off bills to keep the city afloat.
- Its very likely you'll go into an economic nosedive when advancing in era. The balancing for each era seems substantially different and makes era advancement a serious risk. Many community guides warn you to have half a million in cash reserves before attempting to advance in era.
- Once you've mastered the pitfalls, most of the game is just keeping up with the random requests each faction gives you. Many of them are burdens and just create problems for your city. You'll probably built and demolish things just to keep the factions happy.
- There just isn't that much to do in this game. If you weren't being harassed by the factions every 3 minutes, this game would be quite boring.",1706254442,1706254442,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a good idea of what to expect with regards to game play but what I wasn't expecting were the many obvious glitches. For instance, the game shows bits of trivia on loading pages but it's gone in seconds...long before anyone can read it. Placing buildings and roads is a pain. Deleting stuff is wonky as well. This is huge pain because the front of a building isn't always obvious. My biggest issue though are the tutorials. These need to be broken down into smaller pieces that a player can review/reference later. I shouldn't have to play through an entire tutorial just to take a second look at one section of it. 

I'm not sure if I can recommend the game or not because I don't know how well it compares to others in the genre. Do I like it? Not really. It's difficult and tedious. The learning curve is steep. If you enjoy doing your taxes you may like the game. YMMV. 

EDIT: Now that I have 100+ hours on it I feel like my initial review was lacking. I really didn't know how to play it. Now I can say that after 100+ hours spent on the game....I still don't know how to play it. 

I have two options: 1) Fire up You-Tube and spend countless hours trying to figure out how to play this thing or 2) Give up.

This game doesn't launch through Steam, instead through the Kalypso launcher.  Not only does this slow down the launching of the game, it bogs down the speed of my PC.  No game should ever, and I repeat, never ever need a secondary launcher or DRM to play.  If I purchase a game on Steam, it should launch in Steam, end of story.  Additionally, the launcher and game itself has advertisements for other games by Kalypso.   There should seriously be laws against this.  Its just completely ridiculous that this has become a standard thing for many developers to do.  I will continue to play this game for many hours to come because I have always enjoyed the Tropico series, but as a stand against this kind of behavior in future titles please do not purchase this, otherwise it will simply encourage this to become the norm.

***Revised***
  After several hours playing this game I have to not only stand by not recommending this title, but reinforce it to the max.  The game is severely broken.  Terrible mechanics.  I have played Tropico titles before and never had any problem with economy, but this is a nightmare.  Easy mode on campaign missions are nearly impossible to complete.  You can never seem to have any kind of profitable industry no matter what route you take. I even resorted to looking at guides and most people including myself can't seem to succeed either.  You build new farms, industries, set up your trade routes, but all of it ends up costing more to maintain than what you can make back from selling your goods.  No matter what kind of transportation systems you set in place, workers are never there it seems (I literally had no workers at my farms/plantations/mills for 4 months, even though they had substantial budget and fully staffed).  I don't know what the hell Kalypso did to this series but they have ruined it.  I will make sure to stay clear of not only Tropico but any titles they so much as looked at let alone touched in the future. Complete and utter disappointment.  Money wasted.

First of all if you get it at a 40% to 50% sale i could recommend it.

So why do i not recommend it, first very little to no game support since release they've added and changed very little. And no the ""Mod support"" is bad it's half arse at best, I don't know why they don't just use steam workshop it actually works

Any actual ""Support"" is DLCS, which add very little for the price and there's 8 of them, it's more give me money rather than we supported the game for 4 years.

Second reason asking for steam wards, i am sick and tired of all of the game devs/companies asking for steam wards that they blatantly do not deserve like this game and Vic 3 asking for labour of love vic 3 more so to be fair.

Third and final reason dlcs
DLCS are not meant to be a building or 3 and a new basic mechanic/gameplay or and especially things that should have been in the game/free updates or you know actual Support for the game, Hol4 being a example most of it's dlcs are things that should be in the game ""free updates"" example Hol4 dlcs have reworked and updated and balanced focus trees for factions locked by dlcs, you have to pay to get updated and balanced focus trees for factions in the bass game and the dlcs that they're in add little and are overpriced.

DLCS are meant to be a expansion to the game adding many new things like 2 to 3 entirely new factions with their own unique mechanics buildings units policies resources things that the resources make new disasters or demands from your people.
that is just some of the things a DLC is meant to have and do, and the cost of a dlc should never be higher than $20 because $20+ you can buy another game.",1703599938,1703755721,False,4,0,0.538167953491210938,0,True,False,False

Now, I am sure we will figure it out at one point. But..that point will be more than 15 hours in and counting, which to me seems undesirable. Expanding the tutorial to include a more in-depth guide on this would be great. Alternatively/and some of the data should be more accessible.

It now plays like Tropico 4, but with Multiplayer and the best transportation tools in the entire game yet.

There you go. 

Long Review:
If you are a Tropico fan that's all you need to read. Pretty much everything from 4 is back with either a new hottake or a homage. It has 5's multiplayer but better netcode and more citizens and a neat monument stealing feature from Civilization that sounds really bad until you try it and realize it's all the excitement of playing Civ 5 with friends and trying to research Stonehenge first to wombo into Colossus of Rhodes. Only its better because its that strategy meta but everyone is playing really shitty Caribbean governments and attempting to not get overthrown. The two things not ingame from 4 is the ability to privatize businesses. It's back to various flavors of socialism. The other is you can't send El Presidente or your Personal Death Squad into combat anymore.

Campaign isn't as good as 5 unfortunately and the one thing I dearly miss is the Family Tree, its back to just you only. But the DLCs add lots of fun and hard missions. The main problem is that their content wildly varys, some are just building packs, some add extremely new and fun mechanics to the game like a fleshed out Minister and Faction Leader system and stocks, and one (Pandemic) takes your game and cranks it to Dark Souls difficulty without warning. I personally love that and play alot of MP with friends and its nice to have global events that can stop all of the trolling and force all of the tinpots to work together for a change. 

Cons:
Biggest con is the Colonial era sucks compared to 5. It's straight up awful, I don't know why they changed it. Skip straight to World War and thank me later. The one bonus you got (permanent Pirate Cove) doesn't matter, as the Cove operates now in all eras and is similar to the Smuggler in 4. Map exploration is gone and the only unique thing about the era is Pirate raids, which means you have to rush a fort ASAP because your Palace Guard no longer count as an independent unit. They guard the Palace. That's all. Death Squads are also now just a unit called Commandos that you can use to terrorize your neighbors. You can no longer do the no knock raids that allowed you to gun down rivals and criminals at will. Its been changed to an arrest at will edict.

I'm also not that thrilled with the Swiss Bank this time around. It's better than 4 at least as it has more than just score mechanics. 5 had you scrambling for Swiss bux to trick out your family and turn them competent though. Swiss Bucks can now be used to turn the tables on rivals, gain tech early or spawn a lucrative trade route.",1701840138,1701840138,True,9,0,0.61369478702545166,0,True,False,False

I played 152 hours on here and I am disappointed. The way they deal out DLC's and charge for them is garbage and the latest VAXXHARD they dealed out has a building that shoots green homing missles at cargo ships to ""vaccinate"" the crew. It's idiotic at best.

The dictator, assistant pinoccio or w/e, representatives from different powers... Are all voiced by the most obnoxious sounding voice actors, and so are the things they say tailored towards a 10 year old audience and not the adults that play the game, it's childish and annoying.

I consider this a waste of money after 152 hours in, and I don't really feel like playing it. I wanted a city designer.

What Tropico has is bare minimum, and some buildings and mechanics just don't make sense.
Also there is no map maker, a limit of 6 islands, only 6. And they all have to be randomly generated so sometimes you can't even get all 6 to spawn.

I'm giving this not just a thumbs down, but into the trash it goes.

**Note, voice acting and lines are idiotic and tailored for little kids. If I don't want to rule like Stalin or any other idiot lefty sipping on $12 lattes at starbucks, I don't want to hear the dictator sound like one too.


Update.
I've got to add, if you actually have any good ideas, like making game overlays optional, and you talk about on discussion... You will be swarmed with fans who don't know what a good game is as they try to force the generics down your throat. Having the option to make overlays disappear at will is desirable for anybody who is trying to be immersed in a game. If I want to play in the WWII era, I don't want to see the year 3480 in the corner of my screen. Too bad there's no option to remove it.

Bad - Overlays that cannot be removed.
Bad - Fans who are bootlickers and dominate discussion.
Bad - Unrealistic cannon that shoots vaccine missiles at ships
Bad - DLC's are actually generic garbage that add a few buildings that should instead be automatically included with every major update.

It has lots of content, and there are too many pros to mention and I'll forget to mention some, so I'll just keep it simple, and it has DLCs if you ever get bored with the basic.

There are only 2 issues that I find in this game:
1) I feel it has been made mostly with blueprints, because the game can't handle multiplayer well in 4 max players, it disconnects players when you reach the mid of the game(Maybe its because the players reach a collective 2000 population), it disconnects all players when you load the auto save of the multiplayer game after it disconnected the players in a non-loaded match, etc. My specs can handle Ark Survival on Ultra.
2) The UI gets bugged in multiplayer

I recommend this game to others and I hope they fix this and don't make these issues in the next tropico games",1683584433,1700707257,True,3,0,0.557889282703399658,0,True,False,False

They have made 0 significant changes/improvements since Tropico 4. Honestly this feels like the side project they keep going to fund their larger projects.

Graphics have not improved at all in multiple versions.
The obnoxious voice acting and stress of popups has not changed either. They just keep going to let you know you are a small nation.
The land is very small and very little strategy goes into each map. It's really just kind of sad. The voice lines constantly try to meme, but ultimately it's embarrassing. 

This game is worth exactly 5$ and can be used a chill game to vibe to. But do not expect this to be a ""dive into"" game. Banished (a real mvp) from almost 10 years ago has far more strategy.

3. you ruined sandbox. some of us dont have the time to play campaign. so we enjoy doing things at our leisure. but its a learning process for some. you tools ruined that too!
4. why add industry if you barely make anything more. i.e...tobacco makes money, also cigars. but theres barely a difference in income from adding the cigar factory. Cargo airports, but no trains. 
5. this is the best of all. you quickly make people go against you, but fail to give the player lead way. we dont start with a cash cow to please everyone. youd think there would be a small grace period. nope! you basically have to go broke to try and even please people. and that dont even work!

It is by no means a bad game, with an entertaining learning curve and a whole lot of heart.  

Sadly, something - really, several somethings - have held Tropico back from becoming one of the great franchises. It’s always been just a little too clunky and a little too weird, with humor that goes stale fast and gameplay loops that wear out their welcome quickly. Tropico 6 hasn’t managed to elevate things. 

6 in particular is rather inflexible for a game that can be broken so easily, demanding that you figure out its highly specific design expectations and death-spiraling your economy at the slightest misstep. Inversely, once you’re on top of your production chains you’re completely untouchable, which sucks a lot of the immersion out of things. The end result is that early choices are nail-bitingly tense, and late-game choices feel arbitrary. 

While the graphics are a step up from previous titles, citizen behaviour is still soulless, and the tone of the series is getting a bit tired. Tropico has always leaned heavily into caricature, which takes an ‘equally offensive to everyone’ approach to design. Though this falls short of sophisticated satire, it works weirdly well, though it feels a little dated and voice lines repeat far too often.

Speaking of repeating far too often…this game needed more music tracks. They’re all great, don’t get me wrong - incredibly funky Caribbean beats, some of which really get my feet tapping. But you hear them a hundred times, and you’ll get sick of them - and with the pacing that this game has, you’ll hear them enough to drive you mad.

Ultimately, my main gripe is with the lack of ambition. With a new development crew at the helm, I expected more than just poaching the good politics from Tropico 4 and the era system from Tropico 5. This graverobbing doesn’t push the envelope enough, and as a result things feel too similar to previous games. Tropico has always had this problem - the games are actually pretty interchangeable despite superficial differences.

With that in mind, I wouldn’t recommend Tropico 6 - I had a better time with Tropico 4, and it remains the only Tropico I’d endorse. If you’re new to the series, you’d be better off going and buying that. On the other hand, if you’re already a die-hard fan and you’re hungry for anything Tropico, you should ignore my thumbs down - you’ll get exactly what you expect.",1698592242,1698592242,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like having a piña colada in one hand and the fate of an entire nation in the other.

Now, in this game, you're not just any dictator; you're the most lovable, charismatic despot this side of the Caribbean. It's like playing a parody of a parody, where you're the over-the-top leader of a quirky island nation. Your mission? To rule with an iron fist and a cheeky grin.

The island of Tropico is your canvas, and you'll be painting it with banana farms, luxury resorts, and the occasional secret police headquarters. It's like SimCity, but with a zany Caribbean twist and a whole lot more rum.

And let's talk about your loyal subjects. They're a colorful bunch, from die-hard revolutionaries to capitalist pigs, and they all have one thing in common: they adore El Presidente. It's like managing a bunch of unruly children who can't resist your charismatic charm.

The economy is a wild ride, just like a rollercoaster built on a banana plantation. You'll be trading with superpowers, dealing with smugglers, and making sure your Swiss bank account is as fat as a well-fed llama. It's like a parody of international politics, with more cigars and fewer treaties.

The humor in Tropico 6 is as dry as the desert and as sharp as a machete. From witty one-liners to absurd requests from your citizens, it's like playing a sitcom where you're the bumbling yet endearing dictator.

In conclusion, Tropico 6 is the game that lets you rule with a sense of humor and a pinch of absurdity. So, grab your favorite cigar, put on your most ridiculous uniform, and get ready to lead your island nation with a flair that's as unique as a coconut in a sea of pineapples.",1698407928,1698407928,True,0,0,0.478723406791687012,0,True,False,False

Overhaul your military and toss the developer who designed it out the nearest window.

You have a gem of a game hampered by laziness addressing the issues in game-play and a personal aesthetic that likely doesn't garner much attention outside your head. There is a fine line between kitsch and simple poor taste.

Ultimately this game is fine, just like every Tropico before it. Thoroughly passing grade.

It's the lack of any improvement on issues that have trouble this game from the outset that really blows my mind on how this is #6 in the series:

- Road snapping is garbage and there is no blueprint mode. You guys wan't the island to look good right? Maybe facilitate breaking away from the grid you guys slavishly dedicate yourself to and allow for a little more curvature and overlapping with building footprints.
- Uneven terrain isn't clearly communicated by the environment and further hampers planning
- Tunnels and zone connections... honestly what is going on here why is this so difficult to get right? The math that goes into determining where a tunnel can be placed is... honestly my fore-brain is shriveling up trying to understand what the purpose of all this is.
- El Presidente functions like garbage. This should be apparent from the cringe inducing stream you have on your page.
- Military gameplay is garbage... Come on guys this is like a large part of what differentiates you from other management games. There feels like next to no effort was put in.
- Housing is a nightmare and it's not clear who can afford to live where. How about you set the wage to let me know when we crossed over into different brackets. Adjust the rent to allow for more affordable housing? Oh this conflicts with your free housing mandate? Perhaps it shouldn't exist then and you should give back the ability to adjust the rent with some penalty to capitalist factions.

DLC's have some hillariously low-tier language/translation and voiceacting moments which can either be funny in their own right or just throw you depending on you.  A lot of the game feels half-baked or simply awkward to interact with, talking generally about specific mechanics of buildings, citizen actions, or entire gameplay styles/mechanism (like drones) - In terms of 'balance' I think systems are generally good and powerful, but often too hard to 'use properly' from a user perspective of micromanagement and time investment, if not simple UI limitations.  Being unable to see all drone paths at once, the entire process of setting them up requiring more clicks and mouse (and camera) movement than strictly necessary with more robust control methods, to the UI not cooperating when trying to issue actions on large numbers of citizens.  

All that said, this is a critical review.

1) pretty complicated economics which works in not-so-obvious ways.

2) political part is, on the other hand, is very simple. Close to impossible to lose electrons even without faking them + the Broker will help to avoid ultimatums
3) at some point, when you sorted out the economics, you constantly have 1M+ dollars in the budget and the game stops making sense as you can start solving problems by just pouring money in.

I've been playing since the original, and to date Tropico 3 had always felt like the pinnacle of the franchise in terms of gameplay, storytelling and humor. Don't let my low playtime fool you, I've played it across a handful of platforms enough to know that Tropico 6 might finally capture that crown for ""best in the series"" from me.",1696888282,1696888282,True,46,2,0.741618931293487549,0,True,False,False

1.The missions. Whoever designed those never played the game. You are occasionally starting with an ""advanced"" colony. This means you will have a lot of military and other rather expensive buildings that will drain your cash and provide little to nothing in return. Mission 3 for example. You got a bank, a ministry, migration office, a college - but no highschool. Plenty of parking decks. The ""industry"" is ridiculously ineffective and I spent the first 20 minutes undoing whatever the ""author"" attempted. Sandbox is sadly the better play experience.
2. Blueprints. You cannot just ""build"" a building, you need to buy the blueprint first. So assuming you want to build one distillery, you have to pay for two. Great feature! Really amazing! Works even better when completely removed by mods! Seriously, this is the most idiotic choice of this game.
3. You can research ""workmodes"" and change how buildings operate. Most of them are useless or provide minor benefits at best. Leads to more micromanaging and one playthrough of testing out which of those workmodes are useful. There are not many.
4. On the one hand, all information is far more transparent, you can see in real time how many boats you are producing. Good job! But for some reason: You can have a distillery. It is working, 135% efficient, workers are employed and paid for, sugar is in stock, there are no error messages or strikes and still - it wont be working. Because for some reason, the workers decided not to work. They spent half a year in the tavern, then traveled the island for some months, came to work for a month and then left again. This is a seemingly intended feature, workers being absent.
I sincerely have no idea what those devs were thinking. Why would you WANT THAT??? Present and absent worker are indicated in the hire tab and they are getting paid to not work? WTF?? This means your distillery with 135% efficiency is working 2 months per year at best. 
The distillery is one plantation away from a living block with all amenities.
5. The classics. Missions that force you to rush electricity, which you cannot support or benefit from. The events often collide with the gameplay or force you in a nonsensical direction. No mate, no radio for now. The electricity option are extremely limited.
Demands: People will walk up to their president and demand something extremely idiotic, like becoming a pacifist state while you are being invaded by foreign nations. Stuff you simply cannot do. Your options are to lose reputation with a faction or to lose the game. What a meaningful and inviting choice! Same with ""dual demands"". You are faced with 2 options. No matter what you chose, one party is by default dissatisfied.
My theory: After the game was done, they realised it is not particular challenging and tried to make it more ""challenging"" by adding guaranteed losses. Or, in other terms, PISS POOR GAME DESIGN. Because: 
There is the broker and for some currency, you can just make demands go away. Great, you seriously want your players to not engage with demands! It feels like two design teams worked on the game and they hated each other.
After playing 3 more missions, I wish with deep hatred to punch the guy who designed the missions in the face. The mission is not challenging, your colony and who ""ran"" it before you was. Want to play in modern times with a colonial era colony? Possible and doable. But for some reason the designer ""built"" a colony that accumulates 40.000 debt / year if you do not immediately get rid of 50% of all buildings.",1694188370,1695392249,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Raids would sometimes stop working, the broker shop sometimes stops working, and Presidente forbid if you try to mess with the raid queue - it will cancel an unrelated raid for your hubris.

All that would be tolerable if the game was itself interesting or exceptional, but it's not. By example, there's a campaign mission that starts in the Modern Era and declares itself focused on ""Research and Tourism"", and, playing on Hard mode and having bankrupted myself twice in prior attempts, the way I found to best accomplish it was to turn my back on all of that and build myself a solid industrial base with pre-modern industries before I could return to the actual mission objectives. By the time I finished the mission I had more money than God and could do whatever the hell I wanted. The way the eras work, if you start in a later era, you need to do a lot of work backfilling what you would have done in those prior eras before you can actually play with your new toys. This forces every mission campaign into the same mold, the only differences being what you start with and what you have to do once you manage to pull ahead of the curve.

If anything, Tropico 6 feels like a mediocre expansion pack from Tropico 4, integrating eras and trade from 5 and stacking a few more buggy features on top.",1694362663,1694362663,False,25,2,0.705894649028778076,4,True,False,False

At this point the developers are coasting on that legacy and sadly it shows, with a plethora of mini-DLCs which, even if you got them all, can't fill the hollowness of the game.

Odd to talk about in the context of a city builder but nowhere is this more obvious than the character and palace customisations. Even with DLC extras, the options are threadbare and low quality, and worst of all blatantly unfinished. That touches on another negative change, El Presidente far from an aspect of gameplay is now reduced at best to a low-effort avatar. He is completely inconsequential. But then why is he left in at all? Well, see above, the franchise has nothing left but the brand at this point, and if you remove El Presidente then it really isn't Tropico. 

Probably knowing this, the developers have thrown in El Presidente's emaciated cadaver, hoping that it will sell what is, at best, a mediocre city builder.

Some additional niggles:
- Colonial era is a waste of time. Either do it properly or not at all, as is it serves no purpose other than filler
- Lack of political intrigue gameplay, see Tropico 4 and 5 for how to do it better
- Bridges and multi-island maps are hobbled by bad design and tools, ending up in islands which are not reachable other than run-around means of docks and cargo airports

On a more positive note:
- Building variety was good and improved on predecessors, despite eventually becoming bored I was never out of things to build or aiming to build
- Logistics seems a lot smoother than previous iterations",1694281108,1694281108,False,3,0,0.501385033130645752,0,True,False,False

This game is an absolute gem for anyone who enjoys city-building and strategy games. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by the beautiful tropical landscapes, the intricate details of the buildings, and the lively citizens going about their business.

What truly sets Tropico 6 apart is its depth and complexity. The game offers a fantastic balance between managing the economic, political, and social aspects of your island nation. Whether you're orchestrating trade routes, implementing policies to please different factions, or navigating global politics, every decision feels meaningful and impactful.

The humor and satire in Tropico 6 are also worth mentioning. The game cleverly incorporates witty commentary on political systems, world events, and various stereotypes, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience.

One of the standout features is the extensive customization options. You can shape your island nation in your image, from selecting different eras to designing your own palaces and landmarks. This level of creativity ensures that no two playthroughs are alike.

Overall, Tropico 6 delivers an engaging and immersive gameplay experience that strikes a perfect balance between strategy, humor, and creativity.

Farms lose their fertility at an alarming rate.  You can spread manure to try to make up for that, but that takes a truly alarming amount of ranches to keep up with.  

Workers will go 3 islands away to go to one specific thing and take literally 6 months to get back to work.  The whole time, you're paying maintenance on the building and end up in the red.  The 3rd mission ""better  red than dead"" suffers from this.  There is a huge distance between your productions and supplies and the dock to export those things.  People running between things miles and miles away, refusing to use the bus routes you set up, and so your production lines of coal + iron = steel grinds to a halt because your iron workers wanted to go to the circus on the main island instead of the tavern right next to their housing you built for them.  Then they take, like I said, 4-6 months to return to work so your steel mill is just running maintenance and employee costs into the ground because there is no iron to make it profitable.  Even the iron mine is running into the red at that point.  Then people on leisure will just go over to the mines from the main island to.... look around?  Like I have no idea why they're over there, and then they take 6 months to get back to the logging camp they are assigned to.  It's a mess.  

I have played that mission for the last 8 hours over and over again, and there's once that I was able to get into the green enough to have the 50k necessary to move on.  Then the mission itself demands that you destroy your most profitable buildings, which throws you right back on the landslide into losing again.  It's super duper frustrating.  Things they make you get rid of on that mission: all religious buildings (edict used to make people pay to enter generating inome), the bank (generates interest to make income), the customs office (which increases the price of your exports), mansions, houses, and country houses (more profitable housing for higher class people), your ministry building (which you appoint people to in order to be more profitable), and anything else that is helping you to stay afloat.  It's a pain.  

I just cannot get over the fact that individuals will take 6 months of leisure time before getting back to work.  Which lets that building maintenance tick 6 times before they contribute to its profits again.  ""Well why don't you just make an entire civilization on every island, then, so EVERYTHING they want is within a short walk?""  Well, because I don't have the MONEY to do that because I can't make profits.  I even looked up youtube videos and used the most profitable early game money-makers you can: cigars, rum, cheese, and planks.  Doesn't matter.  Because 3/4 of those (cigars, rum, cheese) degrade over time because of soil fertility issues, even if you have 6 ranches running creating manure for them.  

Then everything becomes a micro management hell of trying to make a new mini city for every single industry you try to set up so your workers don't disappear for half a year at a time.  Want to set up an iron mine?  Better make houses, oh and a tavern, and a grocery store, and a church, and a medical clinic, and probably a circus and botanical garden to boot.  Set up a bus route for them to go to other places (which you will have to have an entire bus garage for 1 single pickup and drop off point, so good luck making any meaningful public transport with 10 bus garages you have to pay for).  Pay for all those services.  And hope that somehow the iron you pull from the ground is enough to pay for it all.  

I seem to remember playing this right after it came out, and the soil fertility thing was not nearly as huge of an issue as it is now.  It's like they added manure and turned up the soil degradation x10 to make you use it.  Then didn't get the balancing of it right, so all your industries plummet face first into the red because you can't keep the supply lines supplied when your plantations are all <10% efficiency due to soil fertility when you started them like 20 minutes ago at 95%.",1693007516,1693007516,False,6,0,0.559869050979614258,0,True,False,False

In tropicos 3, 4 and 5, there was always a satire where we felt like we were in on the joke; there were some even handed criticisms of political ideologies and the crazy political climate of the banana states during a certain period in history. Replacing all that in Tropico 6 is a very banal criticisms of communism, equating it to stalinism, and replacing the tongue-in-cheek criticisms of the west are instead very nihilistic greed-is-good messages. Gone is the heart of criticism. 

If satire is mixing of comedy with criticism, this game fails to criticise, and as such fails as satire. 

So what is it instead? It's bloat, I suppose. The title is so well known that it will sell, and the game is passable, and the graphics are passable and the music is passable. It is not satire though, and as such feels soulless.

What I love: Tropico 6 is a surprisingly deep and complex economic / political simulation with beautiful graphics and soundtrack, leavened with a bit of humor. This game is keeping me up late night after night and I suspect that it will keep me hooked for a long time, because the missions included so far are fun, challenging, and they are numerous, in addition to sandbox play.

What I don't love: Tropico 6 does totally lock my computer up every now and then requiring a hard reboot, while I experience no such instability in any other title on this machine; HOWEVER -- it always continues precisely where I left off, without any loss of progress. Windows 11 and the game boots up rather quickly so that's only a minor annoyance to me that does little to diminish my love for this game. If this review were awarding stars, I wouldn't withhold any for that because it only amounts to a minor interruption, without consequence.

What is a bit disappointing is the utter lack of digital documentation, which leaves a new player somewhat clueless about potential benefits of the myriad buildings available until you actually buy, place, research, upgrade, etc each one, and I find myself missing Civilization's Civilopedia which details things like building maintenance costs so that a struggling new player can make wiser decisions the first time. To learn the game, one has only the tutorials which are very limited in scope. Worse, they are actual trials in a real-time game, so they are insufferably boring exercises where you easily complete an assigned task but then sit numbly for several minutes waiting for the desired development to occur, which takes far too long even on the fastest speed. The tutorials will get you playing, but experience is the only teacher available. 

While the tutorials are dull and boring, the actual game-play is not. As a long-time enthusiast of economic, political and other simulations, I am delighted -- my list of ""cons"" notwithstanding.",1690239619,1690239619,True,3,0,0.531936764717102051,0,True,False,False

As usual you can upgrade buildings but this time you will not notice any difference (for example on Tropico 4 when you add air conditioning suddenly external air conditioner appears on the buildings).

There's nothing stopping you from trying to build a communist paradise where everyone lives in haciendas and banana pickers make as much money as tech executives, or a brutal military dictatorship that only cares about how efficiently human lives can be turned into profitable exports. Nothing, that is, besides an unwieldy economic simulation that can quickly go belly up without giving you easy access to information on how to fix it.

There's a lot going on across the inviting white sand beaches, bungalows, and lush jungle interiors of the latest version of Tropico, which look great except for the waterfalls, which seem lifted out of a 10-year-old game. Despite its relaxing environment, its politicking, trade, and mission systems kept me busier than any of its predecessors as I strived to stay in power and accomplish objectives that would advance me from the colonial era all the way up to the modern day – many of my own making in sandbox mode, as well as pre-made ones in its 15 story missions.

Usually, I didn't have a problem with how much was going on because the tools provided are pretty good. Laying roads, building houses, creating jobs, and ensuring access to public services is relatively easy to do, other than the fact that you can't zoom in or out when placing a building and some of the logic the road painter uses to get everything to snap together does not seem to resemble our Earth logic. Only the Colonial Era has a time limit, as you have to declare independence before your governorship runs out. But the other eras let you stay in them as long as you want, and new mechanics are introduced gradually as you go from one to the next.

All the while, you'll have to keep the population happy with some combination of a stable food supply, healthcare, entertainment, protection from crime and war, and liberty. Satisfying some of these needs will usually be in direct competition with others, which leads to interesting choices. Military buildings, for example, reduce liberty within their radius, but failing to build any will make you very vulnerable to attacks from rebel groups or foreign powers.

Each citizen also belongs to a faction, such as the communists or the industrialists, which often have mutually-exclusive desires that must be strategically fulfilled or ignored in a tense but enjoyable juggling act to keep your approval high enough to keep getting elected. You can subvert democracy in a pinch with bribes, assassinations, or rigging elections, but these all have meaningful consequences such as reduced liberty or increased rebel activity. Keeping things legit can feel like constantly having to placate a room full of feuding preschoolers, but the trade-off is not having to worry so much about interrogating rebels and filling the islands with machine gun towers. Both styles of governing are enjoyable (and viable) in their own way.

The less entertaining side of Tropico 6 is the economy. It can be fulfilling to set up production lines that turn sugar cane into delicious rum to either increase the happiness of the locals or make you some big bucks on the export market. But no matter how much fiddling I did, I almost always found my island's economy to be a precarious leaning tower that could tip over at any time. You get access to plenty of data on citizen happiness and factory output if you dig through the fairly easy-to-read menus, but the lack of aids for interpreting that information left me in a position where it was surprisingly hard to troubleshoot what was wrong, exactly, when my treasury took a dive. Not enough industry? Too many service buildings? Wages too high? I ran into the same problems regardless of what kind of playstyle I attempted, including extreme austerity, which was frustrating.

It can also sometimes feel like it takes an excessive amount of new services to fulfill everyone’s needs. When you make a campaign speech prior to an election, you have the option to promise improvement in a given area to get elected. On one island, I swore to make Tropico more fun. But I found that to reach the threshold required for my promise to be considered fulfilled, I practically needed a nightclub on every block – something I had neither enough workers nor enough space to accomplish. In another mission, the United States demanded I increase the crime safety around their embassy to a certain level. I found that the only way to do this, even with my law enforcement budget maxed out, was to park an expensive police blimp permanently over the area and practically surround the thing with traffic checkpoints and guard towers, demolishing a luxury hotel in the process. While this was absolutely hilarious, it didn’t feel very balanced.

The amount there is to do and the depth of its political mechanics make Tropico 6 stand out over its immediate predecessors. It's a tropical vacation worth taking when you're looking for an in-depth city-builder with strong personality and a touch of humor, which is something of a rarity outside of this long-running series. But drink too deeply of its perplexing economic systems and you may find yourself feeling a bit queasy.

Hell, you can make a sort of consumer economy when you reach the modern era if you build some shopping malls. Obviously, you could also go the *better* route of becoming the best (and only) dictator of Tropico, letting your citizens wallow in shacks, making you, El Presidente big bucks through exports.

The addition of bridges and tunnels is also massive in my opinion; I had been wishing for bridges at least since Tropico 4.

My only problem is that the game, like all of the other Tropico's, is that if you get into an economic downturn, it can very easily turn into a spiral, ending the game for you. There are few options, other than the one state loans edict to get out in a pinch. I suppose, as a brutal Caribbean dictator, investors probably wouldn't want to lend loans, but I digress. The economy also doesn't have any easy way to overview the economy at large; it requires a lot of micromanaging to figure out what might be causing your economic downturn.

It is what you expect in a Tropico game if you have experience with the series, but it doesn't really expand on previous titles much. It's still a good game, but it is essentially only good as a fresh pack of missions with a few minor improvements and additions.

Just like previous titles, it lacks replayability compared to other city builders. Once you complete the missions there's really no urge to keep playing. The lack of free modding support is a definite negative as well. The demands from factions seem to have gotten kind of lazy as well. Usually they will just demand that you build a random building and make you wonder why the environmentalist faction is demanding that you build a fire house.

As for the good: the graphics are just as great as Tropico 5. Some of the services in the game have been improved a bit too; people are willing to travel a more realistic distance to get to service buildings, and there are more buildings available than in previous titles. The ability to go on raids is nice, and heists to steal world wonders are a nice touch, unrealistic as it is.

Overall it is worth a buy but only on sale. I'd also stay away from the DLC that don't add new missions (I haven't bought any DLC as of right now, but they are clearly over-priced).

my raids i did 3 rescue raids while contracted to do 1 rescue.

No, but it’s still fun. The main differences are some infrastructure improvements (massive bridges can connect islands and tunnels can make paths through once impassible mountains) and the ability to steal various wonders of the world from other countries for the lulz.

If you like a little The Mouse that Roared flavor in your city builders and aren’t sick of El Presidente and Penultimo’s antics, then it’s worth picking up.

Its either too zoomed in or zoomed out. The graphics lean heavily on the bloom of the white colours in the game but the game feels ugly.

Tropico 6 is a tropical paradise of a game that combines strategy, humor, and political intrigue in an engaging and entertaining package. As a fan of the series, I am pleased to say that Tropico 6 lives up to its predecessors and offers an enjoyable experience that is definitely worth your time. With its charming aesthetics and captivating gameplay, I give Tropico 6 a solid four-star rating.

One of the standout features of Tropico 6 is its vibrant and detailed tropical setting. From the sun-soaked beaches to the lush jungles and bustling cities, the game oozes with charm and personality. The art style is delightful, and the attention to detail in the world design is impressive. It truly feels like you're building your own island paradise, complete with colorful characters and a lively atmosphere.

The gameplay mechanics in Tropico 6 are deep and satisfying. As El Presidente, you have the power to shape your nation and lead it to greatness. The combination of city-building, resource management, and political decision-making offers a diverse and engaging experience. Whether you choose to be a benevolent leader or a cunning dictator, the choices you make have meaningful consequences for your island and its people.

The campaign mode in Tropico 6 provides a rich and engaging storyline, guiding you through various eras and challenges. Each mission presents unique objectives and dilemmas, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. The witty writing and humor add an extra layer of enjoyment, making the campaign an immersive and entertaining experience.

Tropico 6 also excels in its attention to detail when it comes to the citizens of your island. The individual citizens have their own personalities, desires, and political affiliations, which can influence your decision-making. The ability to interact with your citizens, address their concerns, and fulfill their needs adds depth to the gameplay and creates a sense of connection with your island's inhabitants.

Additionally, the multiplayer mode in Tropico 6 is a welcome addition. Competing or cooperating with friends and other players adds an extra layer of strategic depth and replayability. The ability to showcase your island and compete for rankings and achievements enhances the longevity of the game.

While Tropico 6 is a fantastic game, it does have a few areas where it could improve. The AI behavior of the citizens and some pathfinding issues can occasionally be frustrating. Additionally, the learning curve for new players can be steep, as there is a lot to grasp in terms of mechanics and strategies.

In conclusion, Tropico 6 is a tropical delight that offers a captivating and immersive experience. The charming aesthetics, deep gameplay mechanics, and engaging storyline make it a standout entry in the series. Despite some minor issues, it remains a must-play for fans of city-building and strategy games. With its unique blend of humor, strategy, and political intrigue, Tropico 6 earns a solid four-star rating.",1619888408,1687033546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the game has improved quite a bit since my last review, still Kalypso is milking the players with useless DLC (just get the DLC with the drones and airport, the rest are useless) 
still my advice is the same, don't buy it at full price.

well, the game is nice, I can't deny that and there are some pretty interesting levels in there. the replay-ability value is not that good though. the profile management is bad as well.

but what really makes me very unhappy with it is the way Kalypso is treating the players, the sad policy of addons that will cost almost as much as the original game is pathetic.

The AI is poorly programmed and annoying, and the quests are often down to random luck. The game also has a number of other issues, such as unclear island borders, shacks that randomly pop up, and a poorly designed UI.

Tropico 6 is not a bad game. It is generally stable and has working content. However, it is clear that the developers' attention has been defocused, and I would like to see a more focused effort on the core gameplay in the next installment.

Here are some specific examples of the issues I have with Tropico 6:

-  The AI is poorly programmed and annoying. For example, you can micromanage where El Prez' visits, or interact with individual tropicans, to perform a variety of actions. However, these actions are not very important, and you quickly find yourself ignoring them in favor of other tasks.

-  The quests are often down to random luck.  For example making sure you extend your colonial mandate via completing trade routes.  Which can become less than fun when a special mechanic is introduced in DLC like Carribean Skies.

-  It can be unclear what constitutes 'an island'. This can make it difficult to link metro stations as they can only transport tropicans on the same island.  And you hope you don't need a teleferic station.

-  Shacks randomly pop up when you do not have enough residential space. Which fits the game theme, but quickly becomes annoying when they eat into forest or coconut tree space you're trying to harvest.  Ideally they'd have a way to protect forested areas from shacks in future and make the environmentalist faction happy.

-  The UI is poorly designed. It is difficult to find information, and the menus are often cluttered or show unhelpful information.  For example, inspiring statues you need to look up online what effect they have.  Embassies its unclear what the beauty, crime, and so on modifiers actually do.

Overall, I think Tropico 6 is a decent game, but it has a number of issues that prevent it from being great. I would like to see a more focused effort on the core gameplay in the next installment.",1685224831,1685229250,False,10,0,0.563800156116485596,0,True,False,False

This game is like a piña colada mixed with political intrigue and topped with a flamboyant dictator's hat. It's time to don your sunglasses, brush up on your one-liners, and get ready to lead your people... or at least pretend to.

Tropico 6 takes the satirical essence of its predecessors and cranks it up to a whole new level. It's a rollercoaster ride of power, corruption, and the occasional llama uprising. The developers knew exactly what they were doing when they added the ability to bribe foreign powers with crates of tropical fruit. Who knew bananas could be so persuasive?

The game's attention to detail is impressive, allowing you to create an island utopia or a chaotic dictatorship. From lush beaches to towering skyscrapers, you have the power to shape your nation's destiny. And let's not forget the iconic Tropico 6 catchphrase: ""Remember, every little thing your people do is for your greater glory. Or mine.""

One of the highlights of Tropico 6 is the humorous campaign missions. You'll encounter all sorts of colorful characters, each with their own unique requests and demands. The game pokes fun at political stereotypes with punchlines like, ""I don't always wear a beret, but when I do, I make sure it's a fashionable one.""

As El Presidente, you'll face a variety of challenges, from dealing with rebellious citizens to managing natural disasters. Watching your people scramble as a volcano erupts in the background is a sight to behold, especially when you can't resist shouting, ""Don't worry, folks! It's just a bit of extra seasoning for our barbecues!""

Tropico 6 also introduces a multiplayer mode where you can compete or cooperate with other players. Just remember that even in multiplayer, your friends can quickly turn into your political rivals. Don't be surprised if you find yourself sabotaging their infrastructure while sipping a tropical cocktail, whispering, ""Cheers to a successful coup, my friend!""

In conclusion, Tropico 6 is a delightfully funny and addictive game that captures the absurdity of dictatorship in a tropical paradise. With its witty dialogue, quirky characters, and the ability to construct your very own banana republic, it offers hours of laughter and entertainment. So grab your cigar, don your most extravagant outfit, and get ready to rule with a touch of humor and a lot of questionable ethics.

Joke aside, this game is great. The sandbox nature allows great replayability, the graphics are gorgeous, the voice acting is amazing and the stories/missions are fun for the most part. This is a city-builder so expect a lot of building and planning. The tutorial is simple to follow and explains some of the most important part of the game. The multiplayer experience is also different than a solo game so expect some surprises there. Rare to see multiplayer in sandbox city-builders might I add. The tropical republic setting of the game is also refreshing, a small boon for this genre.

I grabbed this one on special during a sale. I got the base game only so take that into consideration. I completed the tutorial, played the first 6 missions on normal. I followed up by playing all 15 missions on hard. Twice over. I will be recording my 3rd playthrough.

However the game does need to start making some major moves forward to keep up with the times. Persisting issues from the old games still exist. The clunky road system and lack of smoothness getting your buildings to snap into the correct places is an issue that needs addressing in a modern city builder game.  The weak DLC is overpriced and too focused on individual missions rather than enriching the game as a whole.  all in all the game is still fun but the devs have to take their time to deliver new features to their loyal Tropicans next time around!

Here on Steam, it says I've played 2.5 hours; I usually play offline on my Deck and that says I have 300+ hours, but I have played this game ~40 hours as of this review; this is also my first Tropico.

Tropico is first a city building game that with classic residence/industry/commercial balance set in archipelago islands, but it’s the sum of everything this game offers and the many tiny details that you must consider that make this game a masterpiece among the ocean of other simulation games that have been released since the early 90s.  

If I were to list everything about this game that sets it apart or makes it unique, this review would be entirely too long, but I have played Civilization 5 and 6 ~500 between the two, Cities Skyline ~200 hours, and countless hours with many, many other simulation/world building/resource management games. When I played this for the first time I thought it would be an average game that might capture my attention for ~20 hours while I was sifting through my pit of never once played games I have in my Steam library; Tropico has quickly risen to the top ranks of all those many, many other similar games I have played in the past and I can easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game and probably purchase all DLC and future Tropico content. 

In an effort to quickly summarize what I think the highlights Tropico offers:
[list]

[*]Limitations of where you can build (because of tiny islands with steep mountains and zero terraforming tools) and how to optimize the placement of everything on the very limited land you have to work with as well as making sure civilians are close enough to homes and jobs. 

[*]Diplomacy and trade management 

[*]Tech trees that unlock new researchable tech in different eras, expanding what you can build and how to govern 

[*]Elections that require you to either win by popular support or rule by corruption/iron fist and risk rebellions/unproductive society 

[*]Economy with scarce resources in very specific places that may sometimes overlap each other forcing you to choose which resource you need more of while also creating logistics and supply chains to transport resources to needed industries and shipments
[/list]

The sum of what I truly love about this game though it forces you to get very creative with how you manage the space you have available and how to optimize the placement of residences and logistics/construction crews with the commercial and industries they support. 

Easily one of the most satisfying, complex, and challenging games I have played in many years; it's a dangerously addictive time sink that can make an entire day go by in the blink of an eye.",1681828563,1681923451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Generally these kinds of games pertain to huge playtimes, but this one does not.

Honestly, from my experience:
-Economic balance is just... Sh*t. It feels like an expectation to min-max, which in a creative environment is just idiotic.
-AI breaks constantly. I can't count how many times I've seen industry running out of raw materials, despite having a literal tonne of said material. Guess the hundreds of Teamster's all took the day off.
-Maps are inconsistent in balancing. Some large maps feel like they want you to expand, yet doing so will probably ruin your economy.
-It's just more confusing than ever to succeed through an Era Crawl. Starting from the very beginning, you're going to likely ruin your later era's through early build decisions.

It's got a lighthearted and jovial tone that really works, and you'll often find yourself chuckling at the caricatures of the political representatives or the various dictator themed factoids presented during loading screens. 

The city builder elements of this game are solid, if just a tad janky. The game tries its best to teach you how to play it well, and it does an okay job at this, but you'll need to spend some time looking through guides to figure out how to be truly successful. A lot of things aren't super intuitive, and you'll often find yourself wondering why you're suddenly bleeding money. 

For example, logistics. Making sure that your citizens are able to spend most of their time at their jobs, and that teamsters aren't stuck in traffic when making crucial deliveries, is not easy. The game doesn't make it apparent if you're failing at this until you start wondering why your buildings aren't producing and the dock never seems to be full of exports. 

However, once you've got some of those nitty gritty details figured out, the city builder becomes a blast. It really is super well done, and it's my favorite city builder game out there. When you get things humming it's really rewarding. It's also fun when you get to a point that your producing/export engine is so fine tuned that you can out-earn most problems. A state that's fairly easy to get to when you really know what you're doing. 

As for the political elements, they're surprisingly fun. The political simulation is remarkably practical, despite it's overtly satirized nature. You have different factions like the communists, capitalists, or environmentalists, and they each have different things they want and don't want. They'll have an opinion of you based on things like your policies and crisis decisions. You can't afford to ignore anyone totally, as they each have a way of really making you suffer if you do. The game then becomes a balancing act where you have to manage competing interests and try to keep enough people happy with you that you can stay in power, while also keeping your little country running. 

This is not power politics between great states. The game quite often rubs your face in the fact you're essentially a non-entity on the power politics stage. This is down to earth, local, nuts and bolts, government administration. It works. Plus the reps themselves are all hilarious.

If I had to sum up this game in one word, it'd have to be frustrating.

Edited and amended.---------------------------------------------

The game suffers from terrible AI and horrible balancing. I've only ever had one semi-successful island in this game and I'm sure it was just from luck. Teamsters absolutely refuse to do their jobs, always prioritizing stupid decisions to satisfy their needs, mitigating across the country instead of using the services I provided for them locally. I have to ask why the developers even let you build on other islands when the punishment for not centralizing is far too egregious. Even when it works correctly, the system is way too formulaic, punishing and frustrating to the point that it leaves little room for experimentation. It's just not fun.

Your El Presidente is rather boring, useless, and contributes little to the overall gameplay. Compared to Tropicos 4 El Presidente with their in depth customization, allowing them to have 3 perks and letting the player to choose how they rose to power. All this provided tangible benefits to gameplay and allows the player to roleplay.   

There's little freedom in how you play politically. I never feel like I can play a dictator. Forever forced to always kowtow to people's wants and demands to build another pointless thing they don't need. Compared to Tropico 4, where I personally have been able to make slave states, Fascist dictatorships, and Communist Utopias. There isn't even a loyalist faction. In Tropico 4 the loyalists were members of El Presidente's personal party. Essentially a cult of personality. Growing said faction allows the player to assume more control over the populous and allowed you to commit more and more tyrannical acts without fear of rebellion.

End of Edit.----------------------------------------------------------

Edit new addition.----------------------------------------------

The budget system is lazy and nothing more than a trap. Do you want your building to be more effective or not? As opposed to the superior micromanagement system in Tropico 4. Allowing the player to set wages, rent, and prices for services, so on and so on. Pawns are less developed than in previous entries. In Tropico 4, pawns had different levels of courage, intelligence, and so on. They could actually accumulate their own money and hone their skills at the jobs they worked.

Gutted personality and lack of decorations. The only decorations in this game are parks. Why? In Tropico 4 not only were there parks but also a plethora of micro-decorations. Things like sandbags, umbrellas, armored personnel carriers, tank traps, statues and the list goes on.  The game lacks any soul. I could be miss remembering, but I'm pretty sure it's just Penultimo that will always speak on the radio. Compared to Tropico 4 which featured a full cast of characters that would interact with each other on air and had plenty of humorous dialogue. Lastly, this is just my personal opinion, but the aesthetics of the game are rather bland compared to past entries.            

End of Edit.-----------------------------------------------

They need to reevaluate what has been left behind from previous entries. Unfortunately, Tropico 6 as well as 5 both deviated far too much from previous entries. Prioritize making the game fun first, challenging, second. For me, I have little hope for the future of this series and will most likely not be supporting it any further.

The AI is really dumb. All my factories, resource producing buildings and infrastructure buildings had at most 1 single guy working in it. Made me scratch my head how one single guy can operate a powerplant or a shipyard and produce 100 boats all by himself. Now you might think that's impressive and it is but the big problem is they're always alone in those buildings.
What does that mean for the player? You have trouble with your economy constantly, not because of bad decisions but because your workers do anything else but work.

Now there are several ways to try and attempt to fix that. Some suggest building tiny villages right next to your industry. I mean who wouldn't love to live right next to a coal powerplant? But guess what, they don't necesssarily move close to places they work in. Now some suggest you can use micromanagement, meaning you pick the family, stalk them and evict them from anywhere until they happen to move in exactly next to your newly build powerplant and that's random too. If you're unlucky you spend 10 minutes evicting the exact same family that just moves from one house to the one right next to it. Back and forth. It needs to be a small village. So they need a grocery store, they need entertainment buildings all close by, they need a chapel and a clinic. 

But guess what again? If they're sick or they want to drink a coffee, they don't use the most nearby tavern or clinic. Oh no. They pick any clinic or tavern on the map. So if they're not rich and don't have a car, they spend several realtime minutes not working. Just walking to that tavern on the other side of the island to drink a coffee.

So to fix that you use the free wheel edict constantly which back then in older titles, was the norm so you essentially delete all the other public transport options. Or you use public transport. But again same problem applies, you have at max one guy working as a Bus driver. Arguably your Citizens are faster on foot, because they wait a good minute or two on bus stops where they could get hungry, bored or tired so they decide to skip work that day.

Worse they don't take the Bus together like you'd expect right? In regular life you have a shift, so you work from say 6:00 am to 2:00 pm right? So you take the Bus on 5:30 am or something? Not in this game, every worker works whenever he or she feels like it.
So you have at most one single worker on the bus stop, waiting to take the bus to his workplace. Or similar public transport. Does public transport make sense then? No, no it doesn't. So you quickly run out of money, with no real fix, because all you do is hope the AI doesn't do extremely stupid decisions and never arrives at work.

Now some would say, just use free wheel? But, same thing applies. Now they're much faster and it helps quite a bit but the more your city grows the less micromanagement you can do and the stupid decisions are here to stay. So you see your Citizens are taking joyrides across the entire island, while your economy barely keeps afloat or eventually breaks down. Because almost nobody works and they also create traffic jams too.

So my final verdict? Don't bother, Tropico 5 is a really good game but Tropico 6 is just not working. I think they could fix that by just giving the people a schedule. Maybe somewhat of a day and night cycle. They go to work in the morning, entertain themselves during the day, go to sleep at night for example. Like this all you do in the game is run after the AI and its dumb decisions.",1677010918,1677011098,False,4,0,0.526227772235870361,0,True,False,False

Tropico 6 isn't the best game in the series. That award goes to modern times version of Tropico 4.

however do not let this stop you from buying this game. It is a very cozy city builder even if the story can turn into a grind fest. the addition of bridges and buses actually are quite useful. The major downsides with the game are the lack of variety in housing and office buildings. The game should definitely reuse some of the assets from Tropico 4 instead.

However, most aspects of the game are improved on at least a little. The main problem is that warfare was completely botched in this game. In Tropico 5, you could have armed conflicts with foreign powers, while in this game going to war with a superpower means the game just ends. So, that leaves you with only rebels(and pirates in the colonial era) as your military opponents. Even then, the rebels just sprint to your building and plant a bomb before your military can even deploy a single squad, and since liberty happiness(affected by media buildings such as newspapers) is the main thing that determines if a citizen rebells, many of the rebels will be people that actually approve of your regime, which doesn't make sense. Since there is almost nothing that in this game that I cannot also have in Tropico 5, Tropico 5 is better because you can actually use your military. How can you be a proper dictator if you can't fight guerrillas and foreign commandos to keep your power? Also, the missions are boring and repetitive, the only quests you will get in a sandbox game are ""enact this policy"" or ""build this thing"" or, if its from a foreign country, ""build this thing near our embassy"". Tropico 5 at least at some questlines you can do in sandbox games.

I've got hundreds upon hundreds of hours between Tropico 3, 4, and 5. And legit? I just go back to keep replaying 5. This isn't going to be fixed and I'm not buying the DLC. I'll just wait till they get bored and make 7 and hopefully they'll fix it then. *shrug*",1569700672,1674354733,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.) you cant ""destroy"" rocks when placing down buildings like you could in tropico 4, god forbid you change the island topography a little. 
2.) you can't see who would vote for you at any time. Instead, you can only look at that percentage when Penultimo tells you it's election time. It's annoying but its not terrible. 3.) the immigration office and the exports/imports office are locked behind research pay walls. So you have to pay a ton of money to build those unique buildings. Not to mention that the ministry is practically irrelevant now. 
3.) plantations are automatically set to mono-culture instead of multi-culture so if you place down a bunch of plantations (plantations replaced farms btw, plantations grow everything now). then your soil just gets absolutely destroyed in a short period of time. Yes! omg how did you notice! the devs actually made crop growing more realistic but only in the soil degradation sense because god forbid you grow multiple crops in the same land, the same way people have been doing for SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS. Also producing manure to heal the soil is next to impossible because your ranches never seem to produce enough manure.

The missions are kinda weird but effectively easy to complete when you understand how the economy works and how many teamsters you need to create a sunstainable economy. Budget has huge impact on the perfomance of resource buildings and effectiveness on plantation plays a huge role. Although when you start a mission it starts you off with a basic balance of money and some scuffed/terrible economy, and the mission has crazy demands, so I suggest spending the first 20-30mins of the mission to build a good economy so you can get through the mission easy.

War is irrelevant and so are all military buildings. There is no reaso to build any army bases at all since foreign powers will just blockade your ships instead of invading, army only matters in colonial era.

Tourism like in the older games is ""cheatingly"" easiest money you can make, it's far better now that tourists don't clog up the traffic, since traffic is non-existent here. Wonders are broken, can make your game insanely easy as well.

Overall Tropico 6 is a good basis for what older Tropico games were, I would suggest more absurd buildings or sandbox missions to keep us entertained.",1672304500,1672304500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the fun is the good looking buidlings you build to build a city which makes you money and you get to balance demand and supply. by building things to supply. and making enough money to support the supply buildings and make profit so you can build more and supply more and do more and make more money to make even more cool buildings.

A city builder.

BUT
oh god
to access this simple fun. You need to first reverse fucking engineer how shit is going wrong first
Its like going into an FPS game and you are ready , almost salivating to have fun cause its just about shooting  zombies in ana infinite survival mode where you have to match the speed of zombies coming in with killing them faster. and the guns are cool. enough just to fun to shoot. and you earn money , to get even more guns to shoot with to get even more money to ... you get it... 
BUT.. as soon as you start. Some kind of thing is kicking your health down. 

before you begin to win you must first plug all the holes that are makign you loose WITHOUT playing in the first place. you havent even taken an action. which means if you take actions there are even more ""game mechanics Debts"" that you need pay off. But if you don't know what to pay off and how... 
The game doesn't matter cause you are just getting fucked.

That's the problem with tropico. 
It doesn't make sense . the moment you go in. you are already paying your palace a dock a contruction building and a trasport company... along with several other things pre-built that you can destroy... If the game just solves it for you what's the point. ... and doesn't solve it fully. So once you take actions.. More gameplay debts.. that you now have no idea how to solve. 
So it makes sense to stabalise your thing.. and you think ok houses and something . Beer?.. 
but no. Basically if they don;t have MONEY.. they can't get shit. 
So you build jobs first.. OH NO before they could make a good enough profit. People die of hunger.. which they can't buy... without money?
ok.. 
But to give food. you need to make a ranch that costs money to run. and a grocery that costs money to run which supports like 10 people together in jobs.. where are the rest of the people getting money? 
ok maybe we make enough jobs to export good , that makes enough money to support a ranch and the grocery hopefully pays itself back cause people pay to buy shit and live in houses.

So you check your stats and... you make changes. per tick.. but you can usually see individual changes ""per money"".. like 12 ticks i guess. And the STATS... these mfs... updates every 12months
So you got to experiment.. and then pray to god for 12 months it goes right
and it goes wrong..ofc you are learning. There is rate of this = rate of that. its all AI going roaming doing stuff kinda semi randomly..but its the same in a given day...these mfs will leisure for half a month.. makes no sense..
AND WHEN it goes wrong.. you have to analyse and correct 12 months worth of guesses and calcuations.
I dont fucking like maths. I dont care if its efficient,  im not american. I just want to make sure im winning by not loosing first! 

What makes this worse.
Tutorials.. Always strategy game tutorials...
all they tell you is what to press and some gibberish about how it vaguely works BUT IT DOESNT EXPLAIN THE SYSTEM! .. independntly i know what does what.... but how does it make me loose.. I dont know how it adds up to the gameplay.. not even combined.. cause there is no combined effect.. each effect is independent.. but all i know is.. this building keeps this bar up. If it goes down.... BAD? .. Politcs? Idk!...and none knows shit about how much money its taking now! 

that takes trust away from the missions.. Which ii tried. and at first it seemed ""OH so they hid the main tutorial here""
No.. im just pressing whatever button the characters tell me to and i somehow don't die. and keep growing.

So what? this game is about being a slave? doing nothing.. knowing nothing. having no idea what effects what are you even winning , what will happen next? 
Its the perfect job simulator!!!!. the reason people rip their hair

Im going to go... try to balance the people not dying first by basically having enough people paying people
and then i wont make any money cause i already have 4 building's overhead from the start.. That i dont choose..
I dont even know how much money i make a month . Only how much i spend.. by fucking clicking on every building.. Or by 1 Overall chart.. not even dedicated one..


anyway i just wanna play the fun game by loosing or winning by my own faults and not by hidden nonsense
If i dont even know what im doing.. am i even playing
Like shooting a gun in an FPS but actually in this specifc fps shooting a bulllet doesn't kill the enemy it makes it worse unless i balance all the negatives i get from firing the gun THEN it makes sense

I just made a few plantations and it solved the problem... thats it.. that's it?
disapointed i just checked unemployment and then made a few taverns cause i didnt care what other happiness they got cause it doesnt matter they wont die or run away. they are employed and fed. and if the do I'll know and i'll look up the charts and i'll fucking put that in. either way at a certain pop. it will balance out and then i'll have to find a way to get more people.. Oh right... raids...

oh no. all this while i thought support was tied to happiness cause of stupid tutorial. support only goes to the politcs tab... which means I only need to focus on completing side missions? This is a random mission generator survival game? WTF! 

oh well atleast i can entertain myself with seeing how many things i can make and sell with industries
OH WAIT. its not really a game. Its set. so i can't entertain myself with that too. Its just about selling then.. really?

should have just called it. ""company man trader simulator""
AHHH that's what Anno is.. its not... a... city builder
FUCK. 

its all business simulations

OMG FUCKING

ok this is why i dont try new games. I get all my hopes up but im scared.. but why.. its either good or bad right. how can it put me in a 20month death spiral of ""i dont know but i need to find out"" compulsion time waste?
because they paint and color and add nonsense shit to make an FPS look like an RTS and i keep trying to play it like an FPS but because there is no conent for fps but it keeps acting like it by having dead brain mobs in corridors that i can shoot to kill for no reason to kill. because its an rts. or its specifcally for 1 use only that's very conditional and rare. 

Idk. I feel im going crazy. but everytime i do. i go out side. Or remember an old game or play csgo  it proves something is off. These fucking compulsion using 2 bit psycology book studying scammer who aren't smart enough to hide their stupid scams just piss me off


but you know.. tropico... still fun i guess. cause it looks amazingly fun. and that's what i have fun with . watching my units do things in rts games
no it doesn't matter if i found a way to have fun
it matters what they promised and how they deliver and what the deliver

but it will always be weird. because tropico didnt try to fucking complusive nonsense me. It was fun
jumbled nonsense ..but i could have fun but loose randomly
as opposed to ""i dont know how this works i cannot have fun""

but what the fuck do i do now?

It is a grand tradition for Kalypso and Tropico to take a spacer game to fix all of their issues. From 3 to 4, and then from 5 to 6. It's not like I'm expecting every game to be a 1-1 perfect masterpiece constantly innovating things, but Tropico 5 was meh to me. Good ideas, others not so good melded together like flabby blue box special mac and cheese. Tropico 6 is that same mac and cheese but given some flavor additives and improvements to make it taste more like cheese and not nuclear orange material.

Same basic game as before, don't get your hopes up for anything wild, but now there's added other ideas sprinkled in-between. So now we have multiple islands to colonize, a removal of the supervisor system in favor of building upgrades and alternate modes as well as more resources, buildings and so on to allow you to take your Carribean empire and start trying to smack the snot out of super powers. And because we're now nice, we have a return to 449 faction leaders buzzing your phone asking if you can help them lead communist revolution with another hospital.

I've curried more favor as an autocratic dictator by farming out tenemants than any other dictator in history.

As punishment for our return to a passable game, we must also reintroduce features no one's really paying attention to like the broker or the raid system, which if you want to burn resources for funny buildings, you can do. I find the placement of random monuments ruins my poverty aesthetic and offsets the irony of a steel mill next to the high school. There's also the removal of campaigns in favor of smaller map to map vignettes but they don't change much as they can eat the same time frame with specific requirements. It works, its functional and it's filled with useless side DLC that changed nothing so you can just wait for two years from now to pick up the bundle for like 20 bucks total!

There's a dictator...but lots of games have dictators, even if they are called kings or overlords or other titles.

You get quests to support your power hungry regime...but they are innocently funny and a little silly.  You can steal landmarks from the world...same as the character Gru in a children's movie.  If my kid were a young teen or even a pre-teen I would have no objection to my kid playing this game.

As far as a city builder game goes it's straightforward.  Most of the buildings are to support trade.  Trading with the outside world is nearly the sole source of income.  The challenge is paying for needed support services without the budget getting more than the income.  Sounds simple but a little out of whack can quickly lead to a deficit that you can't recover from.

There are some random things always upsetting the balance, one being population.  You can take steps to increase the population growth but when you hit the point where you can't build enough buildings to support the population without increasing the budget too much you can't just stop and refuse all immigrants.

Overall, fun, funny and challenge balancing resources.  A good game.",1670189054,1670189054,True,7,0,0.614973306655883789,0,True,False,False

My impression of the game is greatly influenced by my nostalgic feelings about Tropico 4 and 5. I used to play Tropico 4 as a child - back then, I did not really understand economics and politics - but the game was still incredibly gripping. 

Tropico 5 introduced some important and useful mechanics, but it was still lacking some micromanagement and that unique atmosphere of a tropical island. And here is Tropico 6: the quintessence of all the best things of two previous games. I love this game. It drives me crazy. I couldn't enjoy SimCity and Cities Skylines so much, as Tropico. Politics, humour, economy: if you are interested in these topics, I HUGELY recommend you playing Tropico 6.

Different factions, eras, buildings, tourism, light and heavy industry, and just divine music with that tropical vibe make me sit for 3 or 4 hours straight and see my island develop, experience highs and lows, booms and crises, struggle with strikes, protests, rebellions and see cheerful and thankful citizens, who are always ready to serve their nation and El Presidente.

Strongly reccomend,

The game perfectly represents what happens when managing a society, in aspects of both politics and economy. It brings to us the doubt that whether the so-called 'democracy' taken for granted today is something actually capable of when you want your country to get better instead of falling into the wrong hands (By that I'm NOT saying democracy is worthless, it's just...why cost a fortune pretending we still have that good in the window when we can simply force the people to shut up? They're way too stupid to be endowed with the ability of foreseeing...)
But the real challenging point is to keep your country from bankrupting (which constantly happens to mine lol)

中文评测：
游戏忠实地还原了一个社会领袖在治理时面对的政治、经济压力。它尤其在“民主”的意义上引人深思：绝对的“民主”是否难免是华而不实的镜花水月？一个任由短视的群众随意践踏的民粹政权，其所谓“民主”必定是玩火自焚式的举措，如同游戏中山头林立、对总统一职觊觎多时的多个派系做出令人恶寒的动作一般。因此游戏中究竟是高调维持绝对的政治公平、端平这碗水，还是宣布独裁戒严，由各位玩家见仁见智。

The work hinges on a conceptual ultimatum that confronts consumers in the face of deteriorating quality of goods: either exit or voice. The book has been described as influential. The framework presented in the book has been applied to topics such as protest movements, migration, political parties, and interest groups, as well as to personal relationships.
The Exit, Voice and Loyalty model states that members of an organization, whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping, have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to the member: they can exit (withdraw from the relationship); or, they can voice (attempt to repair or improve the relationship through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for change). For example, the citizens of a country may respond to increasing political repression in two ways: emigrate or protest.
While both exit and voice can be used to measure a decline in an organization, voice is by nature more informative in that it also provides reasons for the decline. Exit, taken alone, only provides the warning sign of decline. Exit and voice also interact in unique and sometimes unexpected ways; by providing greater opportunity for feedback and criticism, exit can be reduced; conversely, stifling of dissent leads to increased pressure for members of the organization to use the only other means available to express discontent, departure. The general principle, therefore, is that the greater the availability of exit, the less likely voice will be used. However, the interplay of loyalty can affect the cost-benefit analysis of whether to use exit or voice. Where there is loyalty to the organization (as evidenced by strong patriotism politically, or brand loyalty for consumers), exit may be reduced, especially where options to exit are not so appealing (small job market, political or financial hurdles to emigration or moving). Loyal members become especially devoted to the organization's success when their voice will be heard and when they can reform it.",1669220089,1669220089,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

We never got the modding tools we were promised 3 years ago and yet we still managed to begin making Mods in 2021. The Old-New Devs came from the Mobile Market so they added a shitty Time based gimmick to steal Real World Monuements for your Island... What the actual fuck?
Where is my beloved Eternal Flame? The Cosmic Spint?? Christ the Saviour?? The Babel Tower?? Truly a remarkable way to hurt the identity of your Series...

Then they basically decreased the Minimum Inequality possible by stripping the Social Security Edict (Which wasnt even in the game for the first few months) of the ability to lift everyone from being Broke to being Poor to now only Students and Seniors. Nice fucking Reaganist view of the Unemployed you got there Lymbic. 
Mortgage Subsidies also didnt make it over so your Citizens that manage to find themselves on Social Security are barred from living in Modern Apartments which in Tropico 4 I always saw as the logical end goal, everybody is equal because everyone lives in clean and spacious Skyscrapers no matter the occupation and all that...
And because your unemployed aren't included in the Social Security program, you can't give them decent housing without draining the economy with free housing.(Bunkhouses and fucking Conventilos dont count!!)

And to add more Salt to the wound the Leftist Version of the Labour-Constitution Section is now ""Early Retirement +5 Workquality"" instead of the ""Workers Paradise +25 Workquality"" in T5 which was the only time 100% confirmed time in this Series that Cooperatives were represented in any way shape of form. Very Nice and Epic transision to New fucking Labour we got in this Generation of Tropico ha...ha...

Also, this is just my opinion, and you are free to agree or disagree with it. Just don't make a big deal out of it. It'll only waste your time, and it won't work. 

Anyway, here we go. 

There are few games that really catch the feel of a Banana Republic simulator like Tropico, and the sixth installment here is a good example of how to do it right. The gameplay can be smooth or chaotic (it's usually been the latter for me), the engagement with the factions and superpowers can be cool or repetitive, but by far the best aspect of the game is building and management. Constructing a sprawling urban center dotted with industry and seeing police and military personnel scrambling to reach the guerrillas on the other side of the city while the average Joe commutes to work will always put a smile on my face. Whether you're losing or gaining control of your nation, whether you're rising or falling, the gameplay will always feel compelling. 

With all that being said, Tropico 6 does fall short in a few places. Namely, the unrest mechanic from Tropico 5 has been downsized, and sending the military to quell a protest usually results in said protesters darting away before a single squad makes it to the location. For me, that happens 99% of the time, and I genuinely don't know if it's how I play or if it's intended. Seeing the crowd face off with soldiers and potentially seeing an escalation would be cool. In fact, seeing Riot Police could be a nice change. Perhaps it could be an upgrade for the Police Station. The game could also use some military helicopters (and yes, I know that there's drones, but I don't have the D.L.C. and I barely see the vanilla drones flying about), but I digress. Regarding other cases, the game can sometimes feel a bit boring. This usually happens with me when I've built myself up (I mostly play sandbox, by the way), and I just watch chumps walk and run across the islands before saving the game and leaving. Eventually, I'll come back to play again. Wash, rinse, repeat. The free building additions by the Tropico team are great, though. It's not often that a game group will hand you new content in small, yet satisfying, pieces. 

...I'm looking at you, Paradox. 

In summary, Tropico 6 may stumble sometimes, but it still crosses the finish line for me. It's an engaging game of tropical proportions that has no problem with letting you throw your nation into the fire, and that's alright by me. If you want the game, go for it. I recommend that one gets it on sale, though. Saving some extra pennies for the little guys never hurt anyone. 

That's all. Enjoy the game, or don't. It's your choice.",1581780067,1668110415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has conformed a bit to mainstream gaming conventions and is missing some of the unique differences that set it apart from the pack as a result. A great Latin escape, blander than some of it's previous entries. Still, spicy enough to keep you engaged.

A solid representation of The Tropico Franchise, re-built in Unreal Engine. A great footing for extended value with community and modding support, if a little light on the latin ambiance and detailed minutia that makes Tropico the stand out game it is.

It seems like a lot of the budget of this game was spent on re-homing the franchise into a new engine. Having played them all, I can't help escaping the feeling this latest release is a little light on content. Even now replaying this game years after release with a significant amount of content added since. It's just shy of that fully fleshed Tropico experience.

I can forgive it though. It's still a very good game, with good direction for the future.

PROS: New fast, stable, widely accepted game engine for modding and community contributions.

CONS: Missing some oversight features of previous releases. Old Almanac was better. Too politically stable at default difficulty. Less music tracks than I would like to have had, selection is good, if a little mainstream and 'muzaky'. Seems to lack some of the deep latin flare and over the top shenanigans that were my favorite part of the franchise by far.

Positives:

1. Good graphics
2. Kept all of the good parts about about previous games
3. Finally added bridges and tunnels
4. Added a TON of new research options
5. Added a TON of new mission options
6. Significantly better artistry on all the people/factions within the game
7. The maps are very beautiful and unique ( as unique as it can it can be while still being islands)
8. Unit appearance
9. Cargo airport for hauling goods in trade routes or across the island
10. Same fun game play style as in the old games


Neutral
1. perfectly balanced/diverse ratio of white, hispanic, and black citizens

Negatives
1. Guards do not stay at their post at the stinking guard tower/watch towers. - 3 guards,a minimum of 1 guard can stay on duty at all times.  75%+ of all guard tower losses were due to no one being at their post.  What is the point in putting up guard towers if no one is going to be in them?

2. Ridiculously low population cap of 1800.  Previous games had the irritatingly low cap of 3000.  The population will miraculously continue to drop down until that number is reached again and again.  It does not matter how many babies are born or people you rescue.  You will never get and stay above that limit.  This really does kill the fun in building and expanding after you reach that population.  On a maximum sized island, that will fill it up about a 24-30% of the way.  Self-sustaining populations needs a minimum of 3000 people.  If jobs are open, food is present, habitations are open, and happiness is high, people will come, regardless of how full the island is.  Make a combination of those things ways to unlock higher population limits within the game

3.  The ratio of populations always will try to remain the same, regardless of how far one pushes the education or social engineering.  Many of the converted population has their population replaced by foreigners.  This makes ZERO sense.  If a civilization is ardently hostile towards a group of people, like communists, capitalists, or people of faith, they are going to actively avoid emigrating there, unless they are trying to act like colonizers or a hostile force.  If that is the route the game makers want to go down, they need to make it so that one can outright ban groups that do not fit the ideology of El Presidente.  After all, El Presidente is the supreme leader of Tropico.  There is nothing he cannot do.

4.  Glitches that keep missions from being accomplished.  This is the major dictatorship ending glitch.  This particular game will end your leadership of an island if stuff is not getting accomplished for certain factions.  I lost 2 islands thus far due to the game not registering that the Tropicans had successfully accomplished the task.

At this time, I cannot recommend this game.  Despite this game being 3 years old, it still has errors and glitches that needed to be fixed before the game was released.  IF the game and fun ending errors of resolved, I will change my recommendation to buy it now.

Note for game makers: Please add the capability for Tropico to invade other islands on all game modes.  El Presidente should only be limited by his ambition and by the competence and courage of the glorious Tropican military, not by what game mode he is in.

While I appreciate the move towards multiple islands, doing so makes the game worse in many different ways.  The key gameloop in Tropico has always been intelligently laying out your cities so that your buildings can complement each other (ranches near farms for fertilizer bonuses, for example.)  Because the map is now dominated by the ocean, there is very little actual land to now build on.  The land available is restricted to thin strips.  While there is some satisfaction to be had in maximizing the incredibly limited land that you can work with, there isn't the same joy in creating a robust economy that existed in previous titles.  Also, dividing up the economy between several different islands maximizes the worst parts of previous titles.  Your workers now have to travel between islands to build any buildings.  If you have a tiny island with mines that doesn't have space to build houses, your workers will have to sail to that island to begin working.  They'll barely get to the site before they're already heading home.  If you had the ability to actually manage the flow of workers and goods outside of a simple priority/salary system, this might be fun.  As it stands, you spend most of the game waiting for workers to get from point a to point b, which was one of the worst parts of tropicos 1-2.  You are penalized for expanding between islands as well, which was probably not the intent of the game designers.  In its current form, Tropico 6 is a miss.

I absolutely loved the original Tropico back in the day, but in the interest of making it bigger, richer, busier, and more 'new and improved' with each iteration they seem to be straying further and further off the path. It's gone from being a great game (for it's day) spiced with a bit of cheeky satire to being an absolutely gorgeous game environment spoiled by nonstop cringeworthy buffoonery and 'what were they thinking??' gameplay decisions. 

Because of the scale of the game everything has to happen at a faster speed for everything and everyone to get to where they're going. Even on the slowest setting, people walk at 30 mph and rickety old vehicles zip around town at 90 or so. There is simply way too much going on to keep on top of at that game speed to actually take time to immerse yourself in that beautiful game environment, which is very frustrating. (Yes you can keep hitting the pause button, but having to do that every 2 seconds is in itself annoying.) 

Whether you are playing campaign missions or so called 'sandbox' you are incessantly, and I mean incessantly being harassed to fulfill quests for AI characters that harangue you with the same few voiceclips over and over. They are not always even relevant or logical. (For the glory of the revolution you demand that I ... build a tavern. Wait, what?)  There are always explicit penalties or rewards tied to these requests which makes you feel compelled to tend to them. What's more, you are often presented with simultaneous requests from separate parties - the devs' attempt to force a choice on you and push you along in the game. It really feels like you are being deliberately inhibited from playing the game however you want to. If done properly faction requests certainly could fit into the game but here they are waaaayyyy too frequent - you are constantly being interrupted with this crap and there is seemingly no way to adjust the frequency (or turn it off). 

Other little points - your aide has gone from being a tolerable unscrupulous sycophant to just being a cartoonishly idiotic ass kisser. Why? Oh, because we had to dial that up I suppose in the interest of 'new and improved'...  And in the interest of bigger and better we also had to include a half-baked pirate system and oh, also allow you to somehow steal all the great wonders of the world (the originals mind you, we're not talking about the Vegas Eiffel tower here), and transport them to your island on a rope hanging from a DC-3. Was this degree of silliness really necessary?  

As mentioned, the visuals are very nice. The UI is not bad either - clear and intuitive with just a few annoying quirks, such as the inability to zoom in/out while in build mode and the janky way roads sometimes snap together.  What kills this game for me really is the pacing of gameplay and the annoying constant intrusiveness of the AI.  

In sum, the laid back carribean vibe I liked to chill to in the original is completely absent here despite the setting and scenery. I get the impression the developers of the sequels failed to understand that was an essential component of the appeal, for some of us anyhow.

I love the fact that the game doesn't take itself too seriously and that it pokes fun at world events.  It would be nice to see the other world superpowers be a little more invasive during the modern era.  For example, making an alliance with one causes them to create a (large) base in a random location on your island.  Another idea might be that they might do covert actions against you (provoking rebels, assassinations, damaging your infrastructure, trying to steal back your wonders, etc.).

For the most part it is a city building game with a small amount of military action involved.  The hardest part is typically managing all the different political factions and happiness levels at the same time.  The story lines might not be the best, but they are often humorous.  Even with a few bugs (like teamsters just stopping in the middle of the road creating a traffic jam for years) I still enjoy the game till shortly into the modern era.  Once you have built all the new buildings you want and rearranged your island a bit there doesn't really seem like there is anything challenging to deal with, rapidly causing boredom (oddly there is a DLC where you fight boredom).

I might be a little biased though, I enjoy Penultimo and probably will keep playing Tropico games as long as they keep him around.",1663352728,1663352728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Loved Tropico 3 and 4 but 5 was a dud for me and this one was as well. 

There's nothing inherently wrong with the game technically speaking. It all works as it should and looks great. It even sounds like the same voice actors from previous Tropico games. Gameplay wise though it just feels overly bloated and complicated. Now yes, I get it. It's not supposed to be easy but even in Sandbox mode, you're getting demands thrown at you that you just cant keep up with. 

And I think thats the issue. The game demands you do more than you are capable of. Sure, if you have all technologies unlocked  and a massive amount of funds it would just be a case of keeping the peace. But this is a game where supply chains are key.  

Point in case. I start up sandbox mode in the modern era. The frist thing that is thrown at me is the demand to import 1000 cars and build a hospital. My island literally  has nothing but a corn plantation and a cattle ranch. To accomplish it I've got to set up mines, a factory or two, get a power plant, build a library to research appropriate techs etc etc.  You are, for lack of a better phrases, slammed with demands. Some would make sense in a ""as you progress"" scenario but here, not so much. Dosent make sense for a foreign nation to put demands on another countries infrastructure that doesnt exist. Worse still is when a faction leader is demanding you build the same building over and over. How many bars and / or chapels does a population of 150 people need because so far, 3 of each isnt enough. 

The older Tropico games, especially 4, felt much more balanced in that reguard. 

I have 10 hours at the time of this review. Half playing missions and half messing about in sandbox. MAybe I'll squeeze more time out of the game and something will click for me but right now, it feels like the game is really aimed at those who love to micro manage everything rather than a more casual banana republic builder earlier Tropico games where.",1662080226,1662080324,False,4,0,0.523728013038635254,0,True,False,False

Positives

I like the sound track and voice acting, the graphics are all really nice too.

Negatives

It's difficult to centre on individuals as selecting them doesn't remove the menu item, so you click off the menu/ almanac etc and then have to find them again.

There is no obvious way I can see to force more missions from the colonial power, so it can be hard to have an extended colonial period, you can go for a quick rebellion, but I found it difficult to stretch it out as the missions dry up. (In World Wards & onward you can pay for another one.)

The trading system is a bit stupid as you are limited in what you can export / import, and the amounts. It would make far more sense for you to be able to trade everything but for the prices to vary more.

There is no obvious way to identify where your unemployed people are. e.g. I had 300 unemployed (uneducated) and 200 unfilled jobs (high school), but I didn't know where to build more uneducated jobs. 
Also my high schools and colleges didn't seem to make any more people educated, so couldn't fix it that way (I waited years and had many schools).

Many of my resource buildings wouldn't move out their stocks to the port, no matter how many Teamsters I had.

Changing eras occasionally seemed to reduce my resource stocks and so killed my economy.

Pirates can be really hard to beat, even on easy mode.

Building over part of a plantation results in a bigger loss of fields than the size of the new building.

I'm surprised there is no proper mod support or map editor, it would make for better longevity.

My main issue is that in all play modes there are 'sudden death' game endings where you will simply lose your city (and all the hours you put into crafting it) and simply have to start from scratch, or a save game. I find that infuriating and I just don't believe that that is what players of these kind of games actually want; to just build cities with various challenges along the way. The chances with these sudden death endings is that even with autosaves, you probably need to go back four hours of play to fix what's gone wrong to prevent sudden death, and it is not an appealing style of play. Real world time is precious for most of us.

Other games like Cities: Skylines get it right - okay, you done mess up here, but there are options for you to reconfigure your city and get it back on track. Other games, l like Civ VI have points where you can ""lose"" the game, but can continue playing and working on your civilization even if you failed in an objective. With Tropico, you die, that's it, start over.

This might be more tolerable if these game enders came about through extreme circumstances; you do something really foolish too often and another ""global power"" smites you, or your city is such a failure there would be no means to recover from your folly. But in Tropico 6, you can have a budding city that is working and developing perfectly well with happy (ish) citizens, a good economy, and the majority of challenges fulfilled, but the mechanic has decided you are out of time anyway, so you die.

Tropico 6 is the first one in the series I've played, and since then I've also sunk a lot of hours into Tropico 4, which I think is the superior title, despite the fact 6 made numerous improvements in some areas. In fact, it's noteworthy that every complaint the late, great Total Biscuit had about Tropico 5 was rectified in some way in 6. Logistics are now stratified with warehouses so you can store raw materials and then either ship, or process them at any time of your choosing.

I like manually trading for specific resources instead of just having the game automatically import whatever I need merely by using a slider on the dollar value of goods I want imported. Maybe some won't like this because it in some ways makes Tropico more of a business sim. But then the whole point of the game is to be a kind of Caribbean dictator tycoon sim. Removing the automation from global trading is a step in the right direction and makes for a more engaging experience.

Tropico 4 sadly only had one hours worth of music, and boy did it get monotonous after a while. 6 has two and a half hours of catchy music in the base game, and even more in the DLC, so the music almost never gets repetitive.

And lastly, building a series of bridges connecting your archipelago is very fun and adds another dimension of creativity.

But that's where my praise ends, and after hundreds of hours I'm thoroughly sick of this game's shortcomings. As others have pointed out, Tropico 6 doesn't have nearly as many options for decorating your island as 4. Decorations may seem trite, but for OCD gamers like myself, meticulously sculpting your city for aesthetics is one of the things that makes 4 so special. In fact, 4 seemed to have more life and personality to it than 6. Don't get me wrong, the writing in 6 is still funny (albeit politically correct, we'll get to that in a moment), but the NPC inhabitants of your island country all look like robots. They don't move like real people would, whereas in 4 you could actually see them partake in simple activities like sitting on a bench you created. You could even tell if a woman was pregnant by how she walked. In 6, they're all stiff robots.

Speaking of pregnancy, it is impossible to grow your native population in this game. Absolutely IM-POSSIBLE. In 4, you could do native population only runs by closing off all immigration and essentially treating the Tropican women like brood-mares. In 6, the game gives you little choice but to allow people to immigrate as necessary to keep your economy growing. High-schools and colleges are virtually useless daycare centers for Tropican children when you can just let educated immigrants in. In Tropico 4, you could build an agricultural powerhouse with a few tobacco and coffee plantations and wait to industrialize when you had a larger, educated population, which you created with grade schools (absent in 6) and the literacy program (a useless modifier that I swear does nothing in 6). In 6, agriculture is underpowered, and if you're not industrializing as much as possible your economy will death spiral. The game outright punishes you if you so much as try to be Caribbean Huey Long. You can forgo building schools of any kind because, ultimately, they're deadweight.

But worst of all is that immigration is necessary to replace your dying population. As others have pointed out, it doesn't matter how many clinics and hospitals you spam around your island, you'll still have ten people a year dying of ""bad healthcare"" (which always feels like a slap in the face of your efforts). Now before you point out that you can heist the Hagia Sophia to keep people dying from ""bad healthcare,"" I just have to say that you shouldn't HAVE to do that in the first place! It shouldn't be a requisite to just playing the damn game. Frankly, I think the whole heisting world wonders thing like some super villain is asinine, and I never do it in my sandbox games.

The bottom line is it is impossible to grow your population, even factoring in everything needed to do so, like raising faith happiness and banning contraception (which you can't even do until the modern era. Why is that arbitrarily locked?); your population will never grow, let alone be able to replace itself. I swear, it's like the developers are pushing a subtle neo-liberal agenda. Import immigrants; industrialize rapidly; and by the modern era, Tropico will have become a caustic techno-nightmare with none of the charm of a Latin country and all of the cold, empty modernism of any metropolis. I hate the modern era portion of this game and usually lose interest during the Cold War era anyway.

Also, your population no longer accrues experience in a given field of work. In Tropico 4, he longer an NPC worked at a particular job, the more experience they would gain to increase proficiency. It was always interesting to look at an NPC's work history by viewing their job experience. In 6 however, that is sadly absent. It only makes your population more lifeless and robotic.

Finally, the writing in this game is very hit or miss. Most faction leaders you deal with will still have lots of funny dialogue, like Sister Francesca, the foul tempered nun. Or Erich von Strohm, the representative of the Axis who has an affliction that renders him incapable of smiling. Probably my favorite is Harlan Zander, the Texan good ol' boy who has a dry wit and a dark sense of humor.

But other than that, other faction leaders feel neutered compared to 4. What happened to the Middle-Eastern sheik who was constantly complaining about his wives? Or the Chinese ambassador who looked like the guy in Breakfast at Tiffany's? Or miss Pineapple, the intellectual faction leader who threatened to striptease in protest? All gone. All drained of any personality. The Middle-East representative is some prince suffering from ennui because he's so rich. And the intellectual faction leader acts and sounds like she belongs in Ghostbusters 2016, nuff said.

But hey, at least your swiss bank account actually does something this time. That's gotta count for something, right?

Here's to hoping Tropico 7 will combine everything great about 4 and 6, though I fear that even if it does the writing will have gotten worse as the world gets more woke. Get ready for a troony ambassador or a faction leader who's a femboy fighting ""toxic masculinity.""",1641198256,1661050075,False,89,4,0.6552620530128479,1,True,False,False

Meanwhile, many game systems are at least semi-broken, such as the transport of goods and construction priorities, at least once you're spread out over many islands and the teamsters keep shuffling 32 units of manure between islands (out of 1100 capacity per ship) while the mines and farms are sitting on full stockpiles that aren't being exported.

PROS: It has new ways of transportation, new industries and archipelagos. Running on Unreal Engine 4 the game looks absolutely incredible! I loved how detailed each building looked, the different designs of mansions, skyscrapers and apartments, how natural the ocean moved, the new NPC models, the different Teamster vehicles, the game is is a joy to look at (for the most part, I have some cons) and the Developers did a great job creating more variety for more diverse city designs. I'm glad to see returning characters (though they do sound different) like Penultimo, Sunny Flowers and Marco Moreno. Some new characters I enjoyed like Colonel Buck Scott and Harland Zander. I didn't run into any game breaking bugs, it ran pretty smooth for me.

CONS: One of the big things that attracted me to these games was the small detailed animations and details, unfortunately there are barely any in this game. Things like Miners using pick axes and hitting the earth while working, farmers crouching down to plant seeds, apartment garbage bins overflowing with garbage if your pollution is too high. Small details like these blew my mind and made the past games feel alive and unique, Tropico 6 is lacking A LOT, when Miners go to work most of the time they are just standing around or carrying crates from one point to the other (BORING), in fact for most industries when NPCs go to work they just stand at one point then to the next so on. Restaurant Diners doing jack when sitting in their chairs. Every single NPC children, adults and elders have the same walking animation This to me was disappointing to see and makes the game boring to look at. Some details look janky like how Firemen hold their fire extinguishers. At least we still have Teamsters loading/unloading resources. Another con I have with this game is the jokes, they just aren't funny. Compared to Tropico 5 with Penultimo's snarky deliveries Tropico 6 felt lifeless and sanitized, what on Earth happened!? Also this game is missing a lot of traits for El Presidente and the money in your Swiss Bank Account felt pointless and useless.

All of that has been replaced with hi-res but low concept structures and characters that do not at all match the tongue-in-cheek humor that has defined the game.

TLDR ; It's OK but if you haven't played 3/4/5 then play them before this one

The humour has been declining in quality since 3 and this one misses the punchlines on every level but the dialogue isn't terrible it just isn't funny.

The game-play is Tropico 5 but with a few more buildings and the exploration/fog of war aspect cut off.

There's no campaign this time round but back to single mission sandbox style which isn't bad but T5 had an interesting campaign with Islands that you develop through the eras.

This time round it feels more like a city builder than a dictator simulator, there feels like there're less options to deal with factions or partner with factions and mostly i began to ignore them as much as possible because they only really mattered when it came to elections and assuming you have cash on hand you can always pay them off. their demands tend to be stupid too, I don't know if the pool of options is small or it bugs out but 2 factions asking me to change the same constitution back and forth ad nauseam.

I think T6 was a missed opportunity and a cash grab on a franchise that hadn't had an entry for a few years. There aren't any big changes from the previous entries and as per usual there's DLC that seems to add even less.

Yes, yes, we Chinese people live in brainwashing and suffering every day. Our Chinese people turn China into the world's second largest economy in the suffering and pain of every day. Capitalist countries are free and democratic, and there has never been any racism and religious oppression.

I have never heard of the United States trying to do biological experiments with the elderly in the nursing home. I never knew that the Americans also recruited a researcher of the Japanese invaders who persecuted and killed the Chinese people as a consultant.I have never heard of any campus shootings in capitalist countries. They are all fake. I even think the recent anti abortion bill is a rumor of our government.

The United States and other capitalist countries have never violated the sovereignty of other countries, and have never launched the war in Afghanistan because of their interests.
I even think that black people are not transported by Americans from Africa, but swim by themselves, not to mention Native Americans. They have never been oppressed in any form, they have never been slaughtered by whites, and these bloody capital accumulation has never occurred, whether in the United States or other capitalist countries.

By the way, just because there are some people who like to compare who is worse rather than who is better, their countries has become dogs of the United States.

When I talk about games with you, you talk about politics with me, and when I talk about facts with you, you say I'm butt hurt.
I guess you have nothing else to refute me

Facts have proved that some people are really illiterate and do not understand politics. Some people do not put forward even a normal argument when debating. In their eyes, they are always right even if they have no reason

In their eyes, the evidence is definitely butt hurt, and I'm not white, so I'm butt hurt. Even if the United States can find a bunch of unfortunate domestic accidents in any year from 2020 to now, it's also butt hurt for me to refute the things that some people found out may not have even happened in old China in the last century.

I'm butt hurt, because China's reasonable freedom of speech has been unreasonably blocked by the international community. Even in the steam community, users in Chinese Mainland can't refute your remarks one by one in the comment area. As a result, I actually need to change my game comments again and again to answer everyone's sarcasm.

Some people are brainwashed by the BAI ZUO(I even suspect that you don't know this word because you don't know politics at all) and don't know it. They are obviously not really educated. They are estimated to be the bottom consumables of the western world. Do you even know what Tittytainment is? No? Good dog.

Tropico 6 is one hell of a nostalgia trip for me, having played many of the games that came before I can say it's pretty much improvements all around. There are a few things different, like how you select and inspect your islanders seems to not always work but that is really not a big deal as it barely impacts the gameplay.

All in all I can say if you enjoy playing the tropico games you can't go wrong with this one! Newcomers to the series will likely also find enjoyment as it doesn't take long to learn how to play around with your little island paradise.

The only issue for the franchise is just that they don't really change that much through the years, so it's hard for me not to skip some releases. I hadn't played a Tropico since part 3, so it felt about time for me to try another. I can say this feels like a perfectly good version of the game, but just be wary if you have played them all. I can barely tell you what's changed since part 3, or even part 1.

The concept here is too good, though. It's one of the most fun sims of all time. I love that it's more of a people manager than a typical city builder. You're making buildings to please specific people that exist on your island. It feels more intuitive on how to get the results you want when there are people you can look at and see what kinds of things they need, rather than just meeting the requirements of a chart that claims people don't like this or that. In Tropico you can directly see who is going to be happy and who is going to be unhappy with your decisions, and why. I like that a lot.

My big complaint: I have a PC and Mac, and while the game runs fine on the PC, these numbskulls can't seem to make their game work on a M1 Mac even with years of work and a supposed beta branch for MacOs. I couldn't get it to launch at all. I don't see how it can be advertised for Mac given the circumstances. FFXIV and Cities Skylines run extremely well on my Mac, and the former don't even put that much effort into it given that I need a fanmade launcher to get it running well, and it's just emulated.

It's probably my favorite Tropico, it incorporates many of the good gameplay elements from previous games and combines them into a smooth overall experience, in my opinion. I'm personally a big fan of the era system, and how it changes both tools and challenges available to the player.

I start building in one island and then I need to switch to the second island.
Okay I open the construction panel, let me pick a building, mouse over the second island and I can build.
Hmmmm, can I build in the first? Yes....

Okay, then the construction panel is not share across island, thats okay let me try something else.
I will zoom out on archipelago view and then zoom in the island I want to build.
Does it work? No....

Maybe if I right click? No....

Let me check hotkeys if there is a way to switch between island to build on a different one, still noooo.

El Presidente understands that this game may have some bugs and could be a bit better with regards to its graphics, but to change it would undermine the struggles and hardships that our revolutionary brothers at Kalypso Media has overcame. Their constant attempts at mediocre downloadable content displays their dedication at making Tropico the greatest in the Caribbean, nah the World! Of course it will take hard work, but those spies at places like Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Bethesda which constantly failed at their so called AAA titles has demonstrated that having high expectations will only leave you in despair. El Presidente says, ""never have high expectations and never live a day in disappointment. I have heard the latest games are no fun, but if you purchase this game you'll have loads of fun. Well, soon it will be twice as entertaining as it was, especially if you include some of the DLCs and half as boring too! That's four times the amusement for everyone!""

The mechanics of employees getting to and from their workplaces is flawed and punishes creativity - you will not be able to build up your islands with any kind of freedom as you are forced to build in a very constricted way or your economy will simply not function.


In previous games it did not really matter if people got caught in a huge queue for parking lots; now it is an absolute game breaker - but the game will not warn you that it's happening. Same goes for the research which will generate at a terrible rate because the employees are never there (unless you solve the puzzle of how to locate every building within a specific location)

It's as if they made a simple change to the game - that employees need to be located in a building rather than just employed - but they did nothing to address the issues from previous iterations where employee location was irrelevant. In order to generate a successful economy, you cannot freely build an island economy; you will need to follow very specific (but not clearly explained) plans on farm placement and city layout. I had waited over six months for a patch to address these game constrictions, but this has not happened hence this review.

Buy this if you like a Mircomanagement simulation where you have to follow a very specific and pre-arranged formula for success. Do not buy this game if you like a city builder with player freedom.

This game should be advertised as a Puzzle Game, not a Simulator. Great if you want to solve the puzzle on how to specifically build a system that generates research and finance. Terrible if you want the freedom of a city builder.

Such a shame that the franchise has been broken by a quick change to the dynamics without adjusting the underlying mechanics.",1573738668,1652508135,False,5,1,0.540262281894683838,1,True,False,False

As good as or better than the others in terms of mechanics, graphics, and the feel of a sorta janky banana republic, but not too deep when it comes to actual simulation. A good short romp until you do all there is to do, then there's really no point in continuing except to simply duplicate what you've already done.

Tropico 6 is well made, and runs like a charm, and all of the stuff in the menus seems to do what they are supposed to, but the actual  demographics are simply made up and bear no relationship to what's actually going on in the city. 
When you have excellent job opportunities, housing at high quality, and excellent crime control and happiness throughout ALL members of your city, there's really no  logic in 40% of them living in one shack next to the garbage dump. Yeah, I had a population of 3,000 overcrowding my mostly empty housing in a city the size of Milwaukee, and 30% of them were homeless even though there were dozens of open job and housing opportunities, even for uneducated people. . People refuse to go to top notch free schools.......  I built 200 housing spots which were immediately occupied, and the number of homeless in my city grew by 12 even though the total population only grew by 8. I thought to myself, ""Come onnnn, now you're just making it up....""

Fun little game, but not much more. Excellent soundtrack, excellent road/building placement mechanics,  all in all a fun and nicely implemented building system, but lacking in any real substance. 65/100 for me.

It's a strategy game where you mainly control what to build and where, and what settings each building should have. You take on missions where you are given special objectives. Every mission also has as its basic objective to establish a functioning economy.

THE GOOD:
- Tropico 6 has a greatly improved Almanac (which tells you what's going on in your city) vs previous iterations of this game. It gives you a quick view of your yearly balance, and makes it possible to review and figure out where problems are stemming from or zoom in on specific buildings and citizens. 
- Decent variety in mission types. Successful strategies on one mission are often a bad idea in a different mission, forcing you to think through what you're doing and devise different strategies to be effective.
- Skill is required to create a functioning economy and regularly win elections. There are many little optimization tricks to learn that make for a game that is hard to master, and where your victories feel earned.
- There is lots of silly humour.
- The instrumental music has a fun Latin style with good variety and catchy tunes.


THE BAD:
- Because the game only gives you indirect control over your city, it can be quite frustrating at times. For a beginner, in particular, figuring how to earn money and increase your approval rating can be very tough. When these go wrong it can be hard to understand what you've done wrong and what you need to do to fix things, and things can go to hell really quickly.
- The music is in my head!!! It's in my dreams...
- Some music has lyrics, which can be quite distracting if you speak Spanish (which I do, poorly), with songs like ""We Like Stuff""
- The sneaky game developers purposefully start some missions with a terrible setup that is guaranteed to fail, and quickly. They set up industries in a way that doesn't work (e.g. a chocolate factory with no sugar being grown!), and industries spread all over the island super far apart, which vastly increases costs and time to market, or just not having nearly enough income, so your bank balance goes into free fall right from the beginning. This feels rather unfair. It would feel a bit more fair if they at least warned you in advance that a focus point of the mission is fixing the economy!

THE UGLY:
- They added dictatorial speeches as a new feature, and they are amusing, but if you get a mission popup during the speech then the speech is interrupted and you can't go back to it. Also, every time a speech starts your camera zooms in and changes angle, and it can be difficult to get back to your previous viewpoint.
- I built a metro station that just didn't work, even though it should have, causing people to walk long distances instead.
- In certain cases, a new transport option not only doesn't work, it can actually cause the AI for individual Tropicans to go haywire. This might cause them to do weird things like stop in one spot forever or go around in loops, or walk all across the island. This can cause your economy to crash completely.
- There are usability bugs related to selecting missions for your pirates, especially relating to cancelling planned missions. You might click one mission and have a different one cancel. Sometimes they just won't let you cancel a mission or change its priority, and it's not clear why. You need to ensure you click the tab for the correct building before changing its missions, even though the UI makes it look like you ought to be able to change any mission.
- You have little control over military units to begin with: only the option to go after enemies or defend buildings. I've seen a bug where my units ignored my settings and just did whatever they pleased! Saving and loading fixed the glitch.
- I've literally seen rebels firebomb one of my buildings, and then walk past my military on the way back to the jungle. My military units passed by without attacking, and then waited at the burning building doing nothing at all.

[list]
[*]The music is (a little too) infectious.
[*]Cities have an organic feel to them and are fun to watch over as well as design.
[*]The four ages have distinctive flavours and allow lots of different play styles.
[*]Quirky humour adds some much-needed silliness to the business of dictatorship.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*]Why, oh why, can you only join roads at existing start/end points?
[*]Design-a-leader is pretty limited and most of the options are horrifying to look at. (Luckily you barely see your face, except when editing it.)
[*]Ignoring political events, crime and rebels seems like a viable option most of the time unless you completely neglect your defences.
[*]The benefits of certain mechanics are a little obscure, e.g. warehouses and building-level budgets.
[/list]
Summary:

Generally a great strategy/management game which differentiates itself by being colourful and ridiculous rather than bland or dystopian. In other words, it's the only game in which you can airlift a pilfered Taj Mahal during a meteor shower while fighting rebels and worrying about the logistics of goat's cheese.",1647806813,1647806980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More problems emerged such as the renaming function where the buttons block the name field, how the camera always has to jump to the Palace whenever El Presidente makes a speech when I want to work on things that actually matter - it's annoying! And I reiterate. I do not want to build multiple bus garages just to create multiple routes! That's not how public transport in real life works!

First of all, I am a ""sandbox-player"" - meaning, I avoid missions, solely playing maps for fun, without any preset goal(s).

Several factors make this game rather annoying to play, than fun - even when the intentions possibly have been great in the first place.

The main reason is possibly the missing map editor, because many problems starts with poor pre-made maps: either they lack crucial resource deposits nearby, or they have oddly placed mountains or lakes in the middle of everything, or one or more areas are not looking natural; or even the layout is forcing a specific build-up of the island(s) right from the beginning. A pity.

I will try to explain, why. Sandbox games always have the same issues and problems.

[u] Building industries and earn money [/u]
Playing a sandbox game means, you have to make money fast. Where is the biggest buck to get? Yes, building important industries. As quick as possible. Unfortunately, important industries are relying on resources. Usually ores and minerals. (Later on, educated workforce. I will take this one in a minute.) If they are not close, the player has two options: build the necessary mines far away and invest tons of money and, later on, waiting time for the resource to get to it's destination - or we can choose to import them. 

[u] Trade [/u]
Importing necessary resources is usually the best solution, because it will take some time before you have expanded close enough to the desired resource. So let us import some goods! 

The game divides trade routes between import and export - and then again, between non-superpowers and superpowers. And here's the tricky part: while non-superpowers offer you whatever you desire for hefty pricing, the cheap superpower trade offers are extremely rare. So when you don't want to pay the inhumane prices, you have to wait for superpower deals to show up. And you guessed right: as long they don't, no industry will be.

[u] Educated workforce [/u]
To get educated workforce, the game offers us two options: our very own school system, educating our own people, or get them from abroad. I have played on many maps, always trying to build up my own school system, but the result is each and every time the same. 

But still (27.02.2022) : Even when the schools are funded at max, I have all the edicts possible to boost it, full of teachers, full of students, etc. = almost no graduates. In a period of 50 in-game years, a school will graduate, perhaps, 5-10. A disaster. Always the last way out, is to get the workforce from abroad. Alternatively, I can rescue graduates with the ""pirate cove"", or I can have immigration set on ""skilled workers"". In fact, some options, but I rather like having a working educational system.

[u] Bad healthcare [/u]
I've found out that unusually many Tropicans (8-10, a year) die of bad healthcare all the time. Right from the beginning, I've spammed 3-4 clinics before the year reached 1920 (starting population 150). In 1950 there was 7 clinics, 2 doctors each. That will be one doctor, for each 30 Tropican. (Just to mention, I think my doctor here in Denmark in real life has quite more patients... ) I assume, the mortality rate in the Caribbean of the 1950's is quite higher than northern Europe at that time, but seriously that are way too many. The high rate of mortality forces the player to hire workforce from abroad all the time.

[u] New buildings [/u]
Having some new buildings at hand, is fun. I really like the flophouse and the busker! (:

Manure and improving fertility on farms this way, are nice intentions; but working with the ""Multi Culture""  workmode, is still way better.

[u] Economy [/u]
Looking at given facts, the in-game economy is very vulnerable. It all starts, when you don't have the desired resources right from the beginning.

[u] In general [/u]

- Bus lines (still) only know two stops (Oh, why?)
- The area for pavement-texture around buildings (still) is too small. Often the original underground texture will appear between buildings and/or roads.
- Flags will not blow with the wind, but seems to depend on which direction the building/park/square is facing.
- Tropicans and tourists won't use parks or squares for leisure (why?)
- Children uses taverns as leisure spots (What can possibly be their favourite? Tequila Sunrise?) I understand that children want some leisure activity as well, but please...
- Talking about children: simple leisure structures to build for them, could be fun: playgrounds, soccer grounds (bolzplatz) as well, skate parks in ""modern era"" as well, for example.
- Oh, and why not make a difference between ""children"" and ""teens""?
- Zooming down to street level reveals that Tropico only knows trees and palms, almost no shrubbery. 
- Placing Trees manually would be great, even if not necessary
- Some pre-made maps have lounge chairs, tables and boats at the beaches. It could be fun placing them manually. (Even better, if Tropicans actually use them)
- Or what about, if tourists possibly go to the beach with their towels...? :)

Possibly, I could continue when sitting longer to think. But the conclusion is clear: there are major and minor issues that make this game not fun to play. Sooner or later the player face one of these issues by guarantee.

If you're new to the Tropico series and thinking of playing Tropico 6, here is my advice:
1) There is a learning curve for beginners, I've talked to a lot of people who say they tried the game (especially when it was on gamepass) but stopped early on because it seemed overwhelming. Yes, this game is all about micro management (you're running your own island) but if you give it some time you'll get it.
2) Play the missions first! If you're new don't throw yourself into sandbox yet. The missions are great at setting up scenarios that teach you all the different game mechanics and there's a lot of depth you may be missing out on if you don't go through these. 
3) There are many YouTube creators that play through the missions and it really helps when you're starting out to see how they go about ""winning"" the game. Keep in mind though that they will probably play at a speed that is different from how you like to play. (I'm a slow and steady player)

OKAY so now if someone on the Tropico team happens to see this post a building I'd really like to see is an OUTDOOR MARKET! Please! Especially for early game eras. Something that doesn't need a lot of employees but serves outlying areas much like the tavern does. These are also major areas of fun for tourist in the real world so they definitely need to be added. Lastly, an ENERGY ECONOMY. There is a market for electricity and it could be another good income option.
Okay well, back to my island. 
Have fun!

You follow a storyline taking Tropico from colonial times through to modern times, but you have great freedom in how you do that. You have to please various political factions, your people, and master the economy to survive and thrive (there are various difficulty levels).

This all makes for an engrossing, addictive game and far too many late and early hours of game play. It's hard to place this game in any particular box but (with it's many island types and difficulty levels and DLC's) it has many, many hours of gameplay. Well worth the price, but may not be to everyone's liking.

However, coming from a huge fan of the series Tropico 6 just does not capture the same aesthetic, game-play loop, and overall goofy factor that Tropico 3 & 4 offer. If you are coming from Tropico 4 I recommend holding off on your purchase and waiting for a prospective Tropico 7.

To give a quick rundown of things I dislike

- Very few ways to have a successful Island. You are almost always forced down 2-3 paths of economy and it really encourages you to min max your economy to be successful.

- The new politics system is garbage imo. The faction demands feel like they were pulled out of a 3rd graders understanding of latin american politics and some of the factions make very little sense for the era the game is set in. I mean really? You guys are putting liberal vs conservative dynamics in a game about the carribean? Where half the elections are between socialists, liberals, US backed fascists, and very very very few neocons? It is nonsensical.

- The era system is too large in scope. I would prefer a game that focused on cold war and then into the modern era in order to keep things focused and keep the aesthetics in line across the entire game.

- The aesthetic is all over the place between eras and it really ruins the whole carribean vibe. The series has always focused on a faux central America vibe in the 1950s onward. You go immediatly from colonizers in the 1700s to 1917 then jump again to WW2 then jump again to the Cold war.

- Some of the systems in the game are OP. Raids are far too easy to min/max.

Finally, the only thing I really enjoy in this title over 4 is the ability to sign trade deals that affect relations between superpowers and can also give you bonus money for exporting goods. This system is better than Tropico 4's notifications system where you would just get 5k for promising to complete a trade deal.",1593282550,1644520875,False,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

[b]Major Changes since Tropico 3 and 4[/b]
- Rather than just having one era you now have four eras but beside the first era they all play very similarly. In Tropico 5 it was a complete gimmick and in Tropico 6 while there are some more era-specific content, it's still a gimmick.
- The more serious tone with a comedic backdrop has been replaced by a really bad comedic tone with a comedic backdrop with 5 and especially 6. In Tropico 3 and 4 it actually felt like you were running an island nation. In Tropico 6 it feels like you're a cartoon supervillain, stealing world wonders... Some people might want that, it's just not for me.
- Combat has in ways upgraded and downgraded + is extremely unpolished. In Tropico 3 and 4 soldiers grouped up and fought as individuals. Now they're just stacks with cosmetic troops that run around in battle with little rhyme or reason with extremely low-effort animations, usually not even hitting their targets(though still dealing damage). Tropico 5 and 6 added vehicles though they're just cosmetic with better stats than normal soldiers.
- While having multiple islands sounds better than one, in reality it is multiple small islands, with the overall map the same size as it always has been... Another gimmick.
- Tropico 4 added speeches which allowed you to make promises and raise relations with a particular political group. Tropico 6 readds this after it was removed from 5. Sad they had to use it as a selling point... ""Oh yeah remember that feature you really liked? We added it back!""
- Tropico 6 lets you 'customize' your palace... In reality it's the most basic and lazy 'customization' feature I've ever seen from a game. It feels like something I'd buy from a $5 old Tropico DLC.
- Tropico 5 and 6 has incredibly dumbed down or should I say 'simplified' the AI of citizens. For performance reasons I imagine but I was much less invested in my citizens knowing this.
- Tropico 5 and 6 takes away much of the more specific controls you had on housing, business and other buildings. You could really alter the specific prices people had to pay, their taxes, etc in Tropico 3 and 4. While you can still *kinda* do this in Tropico 5 and 6, it's limited to five options between really bad and really good.

[b]TL;DR[/b]
I guess with Tropico 6, the series is never sailing back to it's roots. It's always gonna be a 'haha funne dictator' game now...
If you want a completely silly casual city-builder that never takes itself serious, get Tropico 6. If you want a city-state builder which while more grounded in reality still has quite a few laughs and parodies, get Tropico 4.",1634682547,1644113711,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art direction is really nice, the dialogue is funny and clever,  the gameplay is smooth and very interesting AND there is a TON of content (Even without any of the DLC's). The music is also fantastic, and very energetic (Which gives you a lot of energy so that you don't get bored). The machanics are very fun, and they feel fleshed out with all the buildings that you can use to change or interact with the mechanics.

With that said
There are some things, that i think would be cool to have or improve upon in the game.
1. It would be cool to be able to walk on the streets of tropico... Or at least be able to pan the camera up and down.
2. Perhaps some more variety to ""Canal Uno"" or ""Spitter"", since they are the two things that you hear/see most often in the game when it comes to interaction with ingame people... Or just when ""Canal Uno"" plays
3. More people at the presidents Palace when he is speaking. I understand that it might be a bit hard to implement, since every ""person"" in the game has a extensive personality which obviously makes them quite resource-intensive.
4. Just a suggestion: Maybe you could do something with the military since conflicts are a little boring. Maybe some tactics, or something

I give this game a strong... 9,1/10-9,5/10        Definitely worthy of a -Fantastic-

I can, however, say that this game is full of charm, genuinely funny tongue-in-cheek satirical comedy.  The city building has enough options and variations you can take to give it good replay value, and side systems like raids and the entire political system play well into each other making an overall fun experience.

Some systems in the game aren't particularly intuitive, and I have faced some issues with things like public transport and how exactly the teamsters prioritize moving resources around the islands.  I faced a bit of a learning curve learning to play, as I'm not well versed in city-builders, but learning the systems didn't take more than a few attempts to figure out.

Each iteration of the series has delivered consistently good updates without messing up the formula. Tropico 6 is the latest and greatest, you can read a proper review if you really want to know specifically why.

My only complaints are that the game gets challenging to manage at larger populations, as there isn't that many tools to seeing into the state of your supply chains and see where the bottlenecks are. Something like having a farm fertility view (which would show the current efficiency of all farms in a single view without having to click through all your farms) would be super helpful. Other things like tourist occupancy, supply chain views (how well your industrial buildings are being fed with resources), teamster views (where there are teamster inefficiencies), and how busy ports are (to know when you need more ports) would be so helpful.

Also, some of the missions are not that interesting or weirdly difficult. I am not a fan of the drones mission in Carribean Skies for instance which cuts off all the other missions so that's no fun.

I enjoyed Tropico 3 much more than Tropico 5, mostly because Tropico 5 abandoned some of the simplicity without redundancy that made Tropico 3 so addicting. Tropico 6 feels like a return to this relative simplicity, while adding some challenging innovations, such as multiple islands, that create new challenges and eras in your island-building experience. There are familiar industries that feel just like those from earlier games, as well as new industries that allow you to try your hand at economic portfolio-building. You are rewarded for focusing on a single industry, while also being incentivized to diversify through trade contracts. In a change from Tropico 3, a foreign invasion does not end the game; in Tropico 6 you can actually fight them off. Elevation has massively expanded from Tropico 3, and your island can have a profound diversity in elevation that leads to spectacular overhead views as your settlement expands. Factions have a heavier hand in how things work, and upholding promises you make in brevity to your constituents is vital in securing your spot as a respected leader. 

Though I've only played a few games so far, I am excited for many more. I highly recommend this game for long-time Tropico fans!",1639968472,1639968472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Out of all the tropicos I have played from 3 to 6 this one is the worst out of the series. 

UPDATE:
After an added playtime of 51 hours I must stand by my earlier review. 

Even with the new added buildings, a few features and a little pressure I can still say this game pales in comparison of the previous games. 

Pros-
colorful
Okay controls
Fixed some of the export/import opitions missing in tropico 5 and lets you pick your missions

Neutral
Voice acting is a little meh and lacks the good humor found in earlier games

CONS- 
Mess and overly complex economic system where 3 weapons factories running full bore with no imported materials won't carry you. 

The tasks/missions found inside of the missions tend to harm you a lot more than help you. This makes politics messing, complex and flat out annoying. If you don't do a lot of political gaming then it will take you awhile to wrap this around your head.

Missions feel like a farewell and while in the past your president had an affect on the missions this time he does nothing.

Expensive and rather boring DLCs that give you one island, a building and perhaps a quick mission. 

Game missing a little bit of Polish that is needed to make things transfer easy. For example in a mission in the game you are on a barren island yet all the tasks for me were about growing crops when you can't.

Forget this game and go play Tropico 4 with the modern times DLC, better humor, missions and gameplay

Added Cons from edit
The game is impersonal, I can't fully understand what my citizens want or need. I can't personally adjust the buildings to give the wages and quality that is needed and budget impact seems lacking in this game. You are so disconnected from your people that they have no meaning to you. The economy is still bugged and hard to make money. The statistics are lacking and you are left wondering just what is happening.

The NPCs still lack personality. 

In summery go back to playing 4 and maybe 5. At this point I doubt I'll buy another game from this studio.",1599164026,1639943086,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It all began as expected. I was enjoying the makings of my very own tropical paradise. For the first few days I was enthralled by the magic of it all. I observed as my beloved constituents rushed from their tiny shacks to their farms, from their little chapels to the tavern and back. I delighted as I built more amenities for them; celebrated as I saved them from greedy pirates and uneducated rebels; howled in joy as a blimp stopped by and dropped the Taj Mahal next to my handsome palace! I was enriching the lives of the common man through the guidance of a benevolent iron fist!

.... 

The first signs that something was wrong came at night. I was tossing and turning in my bed, for I could not sleep. Somewhere in the back of my head, I could hear it, ever so faintly - the rhythmic tapping of claves. I was perplexed, but tired enough that I eventually fell into slumber.

The second night after that, I went to bed again, with a head full of happy thoughts, like those of my citizens in their newly electrified flophouses. Again, the claves returned, this time accompanied by a repetitive, but stylish flourish of bongo beats. This time I had to take a sleeping pill before my eyes would close.

The next afternoon, while I was trying to focus on work, the claves and bongos were pounding in my head, straining my concentration. 

Then the trumpets appeared.

For the next few days, I began to break down as new instruments appeared. Cymbals, pianos, saxophones, guitars - all had wormed their way into my mind, like a parasite that feeds on the madness of its host. My mental state could only be described as ""Caribbean Salsa Torture"". I was haunted day and night by repetitive, royalty-free salsa instrumentals.

I used to like dancing, but my girlfriend and I burnt our dance shoes in a bonfire soon after, as she was struck by this unbearable curse as much as me. I could no longer function in everyday society. The music permeates everything I do.
Trying to listen to a soothing Bach symphony on a cozy afternoon? No, now you are listening to Sebastiano Bachito, from Havana.
Trying to immerse yourself in a fantasy novel? Impossible, the characters are always on a tropical island doing the mambo.
Riding a bike? Can't, legs are doing salsa movements.
Business meeting? No, salsa.
Job interview? Salsa interview.
Grandma's funeral? Why are they playing salsa this is disrespectful
Drinking? Salsa flavour.
Eating? Salsa
Breathing? SALSA
Sleeping?! SALSA SALSA SALSAAAA

YOUR LIFE IS SALSA NOW. IT WILL NEVER END. THE SAME 10 TRENDY UPBEAT LOOPS HAVE BECOME PART OF YOU. YOU ARE SALSA. WE ARE SALSA. EVERYTHING IS SALSAAAAAAAaaaslkdalkjnfkplolkcxvpkw

Main problem here is the UI and not the design itself, I think. I can understand the idea of fully simulating worker behaviour (work is stopped while out of building), but you need to create enough UI so that the player can at least figure it out, and at best optimize it correctly. Here you don't even get to know the production rate of a building (at least of 1 worker while it is on shift would be enough). No info on worker needs cycle, including time spent in buildngs (btw, even woker shift length is unknown). I can continue this list for a long time.

You can say, that this is not ment to be an optimization game, more just a casual one. But the economy here is so complex that it's just impossible. I think most casual players will find themselves drowning in debt with no chance of figuring out why.

And the honorable mention goes to the fact, that there is so little new here compared to the previous title. Several islands? Well, i figure it was a huge deal for them to add a bridge, ok. Worker simulation? It was already there, they just turned on production halting when the're out of the building.
Raid mechanics and world wonders were nice, kudos for this.

I was more into the laid back nature of Cities Skylines. However, months later, I revisited this game and I have enjoyed it. I have not played any previous versions of this game, so my opinion is simply based on Tropico 6.
I like the mechanics of the game, for the most part. I like that you get foreign aid when you are running in the red. I do think that there should be more realistic housing options, especially for the ""Poor."" Tenements went away in the early 1900s, yet that is the only option, regardless of whether you are in modern times or not. Why not offer project housing?
I wish that overlays were a bit more intuitive and that I could have more viewing options, like what is the education coverage? Also, why have a bus garage when it only has one starting and ending stop? Buses usually have more stops than that. I am basing this off my experience with Cities Skylines.
I like that you can upgrade buildings over time. I think that upgrades that aren't immediately available should not be visible. I click through tabs, thinking I can upgrade when I can't. I don't keep track of what era I need to be in for upgrades.
Overall, I have enjoyed this game. Sometimes the demands are dumb or outrageous, but that's the game, I guess. I like the mechanics and graphics.

The TL;DR is: It runs like garbage...don't bother if you're a Linux user...

I'm a huge fan of the Tropico series, I've played them all and being a Linux user, seeing one of my favourite franchises on Linux got me very excited but...the system ""requirements"" couldn't be further from the truth. Even on a machine many times faster than the so called ""minimum requirements"" the game just barely scrapes 10 - 15 FPS on the lowest possible presets at 720p. I've tried just about everything to try and enjoy this game on my Linux machine, but nothing works, it runs slow as molasses no matter how hard I try. My CPU and GPU aren't anywhere near saturated, yet the game clearly doesn't make use of the hardware available. The outcome of all this pain? I purchased the Xbox version, at least I could play the game there albeit with insanely long load times and controller input.

If you're playing the game on Windows, kudos to you, you're getting a much better experience, and I'd recommend it for anyone that's a fan of the series. On Linux, however, the port is half-assed at best which seems to be a common thread with many Linux native ports released on Steam. I wholeheartedly hope the release of the Steam Deck will encourage developers to get their heads our of their asses and fix their Linux ports.

The one thing I disliked is that certain building that doesn't make sense and isn't practical, like the Bus Station. It's pointless to have an end-to-end bus service on an island nation especially if it means you have to have a new bus stand for a new route for a place that has an issue with land space.",1625582528,1634659195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Needs a bit of overhauling around the edges but the game is interesting. Now the game's system is like Tropico 5 with a dash of Tropico 4

PRO's

-International Relationships are now dead serious, you can't simply trade with one nation and placate the other easily. Until you build luxury restaurants to wine and dine all dignitaries that is. Exploits can make you rich by the way.
-Smuggling seems easy but then it can make you a serious pariah
-Interesting exploits, uranium to run nuke plants, many building mechanics to design your infrastructure into different playstyles. Plant Fire Departments evenly to reduce maintenance costs of buildings or have one and spray fires with a helicopter, using the space to build more stuff?
-The Broker lets you use your private cash to build up.
-Unique events can be interesting in a good way

CON:
-Unique events can be interesting in a bad way
-TOO EXPENSIVE. Seriously 150 lira for a DLC? are you serious?
-Social pyramid is for some reason unpassable like the fifth game. An uneducated worker can never be richer than a high schooler. In Tropico 4 you did arbitrary payments. I guess they wanted to streamline.
-Planting trees aren't there. W H Y
-If your starting money is very low, you will be literally unable to play in a vicious cycle

The graphics is pretty awesome and yet it still runs well at max settings 4K.

There is a small lack of customization, like the attributes of your dictator are also missing, I liked that and also leveling them.
A few visual bugs, a few annoying bugs like building a Spy academy suddenly triggers a revolution even tho I have an approval of 96% and people like me. Rebels keep appearing out of nowhere even tho I give them everything they want. 
Enemy superpowers keep crying about expelling the other factions from our embassy. Like fuck off. Or at least they should give us a huge bonus/reward. 

I also feel you need to have more options, the cool part about this game is that you can do mostly anything, someone pisses you off, arrest them, kill them, put them in an asylum, make it look like an accident. The problem is once I sent my people to kill someone, took them like half an hour on 4x speed to get there and then they moved with the prisoner rather than just executing them. 
On the same note, combat is pretty horrible, hopefully they will fix this. Like at one point I had an aircraft carrier that cost a shitload and it was close to my palace and yet it barely did any damage when swarmed by hundreds of rebels. That thing should like take out 10 rebels in one sweep and maybe include more than one plane? For a military state with good army, I had issues on my second game with enemies. Not to mention the bug where they swarmed the palace all of a sudden and my tanks didn't even get there in time since they just spawned very close. 

I mean if you are not unlucky, for bugs like those to happen to you, the game is really fun and you can do whatever you want, tho I feel we're lacking in laws or edicts and maybe add more function to the presidente, it's like he's not even useful anymore, to visit buildings you need to pay 1000 and it takes him way too long to get there if there is no car close by. If there was a trait where he would visit on his own that would be great or if you keep doing it, he learns to do it himself. Otherwise once you are big, you have no time to micro manage him to walk all around and do stuff.

We need more customization, more skills, more freedom. And less ""sudden rebels"" when everything is going so well. And more fear factor rather than have the relatives become rebels if you execute someone that's bad, like wtf? My mom was a criminal or rebel and she died, so I will be one too. Instead of ""omg that shit is terrifying, I don't wanna end up like my mom!"". Add a bit more dread to the game rather than just people that are unhappy. I feel a dictator would have much more power. And even when I went almost full ""nice"" and got everyone happy, I got 100 people revolutions and other crap. Where did they even get guns? Not to mention their movement is horrible, they all line up and look like the Flash running. I mean that airplane dropping bombs should like kill all of them if they stack like that, instead it did shit. Some of the cool things in the game should be better, like the carrier. Like the nuclear power plant that burns every 2 minutes even tho I have a fire station and installed most upgrades. Ridiculous. And then it doesn't even provide so much power, it should be like twice at least. 

But all in all, since the game isn't even super expensive and since you have so much content and replayability + multiplayer, it should be totally worth it. More than some titles I regret like TW Three kingdoms. I'd give it a solid 8/10 and without some of the bugs or broken mechanics that occur sometimes, it would be an easy 9. Add more content and customization and it's easily a 10. 


Update: The game has been on Origin vault (4$ per month) for a long time and way too fast after release. And the new DLC seems to unlock previous features of the other Tropico games and pretends to add new stuff. Sorry but I pre purchased a 50 euro game to buy another 10 euro DLC to play something that people get for free on Origin. Really shitty practices from the company. Just play it for free on Origin or wait for 2 years until they actually release all the DLC and buy it all for like 7-10$ on sale. Same thing happened to Tropico 5.

The money system also very punishing.

They make the game actively worse specifically for the people who supported them to this point, because nobody else would buy the DLC.

After being slightly disappointed with it's predecessor I was hesitant to picking up Tropic 6. However after working through some of the campaign missions I can easily say that this brand and company have completely moved in the right direction and have regained any faith I had lost.

Despite seeming simple, the addition of multiple ""islands"" per island is a very welcome shakeup to the mechanics and process. It also had me realizing how weirdly un-island like the maps were on previous titles! There are a plethora of buildings with different modes and synergies to keep your island running as efficiently (or corrupt!) as possible. The new quest and purchasable mechanic with the Swiss bank account has also added an air of depth and complexity to an otherwise pointless system.

All in all, I'd gladly vote El Presidente! And I assure you, this has nothing to do with the simultaneous bribes* and secret police threats* I have received on this topic.

At one point I institutionalized literally over 100 rebels, building 4 sanitariums to ""Re-educate"" them.  This did nothing at all.  Jailing them did nothing--more simply appeared out of the woodwork.  Endless checkpoints?  A guard tower on every corner?  Also no effect.

I lost connection with a friend of mine 3 times in <6 hours. Worse than that, a game from 2019 does not have an automatic autosave system for multiplayer. Even worse than that, after the second time it happened, I started saving manually every few years. We lost connection again,and all my saves except for the oldest one were ""corrupted"", according to the in-game error messages.

If this was any other game, I would've quit after the 2nd time, but this game is pretty great, so I'm still playing.

Edit: After some experimentation, it looks like if one of the players in the match loses connection ,or abruptly closes the game, any saves made after that will be ""corrupted"", according to the in-game error messages. 

I'm no game dev, but I'm pretty sure things like this should not be happening.
If you want to play with friends, trying your luck with a cracked copy might be a decent ideia before buying Tropico 6, at least until they've fixed these issues.

Which they might, considering that, at launch, the game did not have any saving system for multiplayer. It just wasn't implemented and took months to be added. But, either way, if there's a way to play multiplayer matches with a cracked copy, don't support this ridiculous stuff.

Otherwise, great game, I'm still trying to play and I'm sure I'll have great fun in singleplayer.",1567826184,1631220227,True,0,0,0.507462680339813232,0,True,False,False

That's a good premise, and the game is pretty, has genuinely rather good humour and comprehensive tutorials. Sadly, it just doesn't work for me: I played three of the missions and now I'm bored, without even having gone into half of the game eras. Why? I think the game tries to cover too much ground and does it all barely adequately; a bad case of prioritising quantity of content over quality of mechanics.

For example, the economic city builder is about making money by setting up production supply chains while keeping people happy. Some of this is done well, for example by removing micromanagement of saying who works where when. But then something are not explained (ie: how many distilleries do I need per sugar farms to optimise rum production, or how much income does a citizen need to become rich) and some other things are apparently left to the individual pop AI and appear random (ie: prioritising the delivery of goods between places, what entertainment venues get visited by whom when). What's left is then a sleek economic system posing a nice strategic challenge, but without enough information for the player to approach it that way.

The same is true when it comes to political or great power factions, or if you try to role play it. What's left is superficially a good game, but one that actively discourages you from going into it in any depth at all. That said, I was hooked for 20 hours, so if all you're looking for is a fun and (very) casual city builder, then you could do worse.",1631019087,1631019087,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Tropico 6 unlike Tropico 3 and Tropico 4 (while having some of the charm of Caribbean culture) lacks that soul of Tropico 3 and Tropico 4 that have attracted so much in the past decade.

No politics soul!

If we think about what would be the moto in the current Tropico games that followed the isometric old Tropico games, it could be: the promise not of another type of more complete simulation, but of an emulated interactive social integration that could bring perhaps a non-realism of a structure in which the player could venture into the tropics comically and politically. It's a problem with several games from various western franchises that moved from isometric to 3D. When we imagined in 2D and text-based we used more our skills, knowledges and creativity. At a lower resolution we were able to figure out how to venture into what the game couldn't offer visually, and sometimes this was very positive as the game designers themselves invested more in plot and dialogue to compensate. However, with the promise of 3D, the sides that we could show in these games didn't show up very well as power of involvement, immersion, flow. Tropic 3, 4 and 5 carried out this change reasonably - right there it already seemed to be the limit of this change from isometric 2D, there would be no way to expand the game much. In Tropic 6, we can sense the limit in plot weakness and auxiliary character interactions in short, repeated dialogues, which already existed in reasonably the same way in previous Tropico games. There hasn't been a huge expansion of what we'd really like to experience in Tropico - politics. I want to be more tyrant, or more hard-line or more corrupt!

 With Tropic 6 the multiplayer online game could be the big change but it wasn't enough. The online mode could keep the player for a few more hours of gameplay, but overall at around 10 hours of gameplay the average young adult player who already knows similar games tends to drop their saves.

 Optmization - Low. That Unreal Engine build needs 16GB RAM and SSD to run properly. 

 Accessibility - very low. 

 Strong suit - in Tropic 6 it's relatively easy to enable an infinite money mode and unlock more features and quickly advance the ages (including the dark Swiss Broker feature - that it is very fun -) - although this facility makes the player quickly resort to an overpower path/ god mode.

Tropico 6 is a solid city simulation game. It feels like it kept the best, most successful parts of each of the previous versions of this game and ditched the rest. Even the raids from Tropico 2 are back.

My biggest gripe is that the game has lost a lot of the tongue-in-cheek, darker humor that gave the first few games in the series a sharp, satirical tone. The soundtrack is pretty generic. The character models are bland to the point of being completely unhelpful when trying to determine at a glance what a citizen's profession is. 

For all the streamlining that has happened over the course of six games, the series has lost much of what made it unique. It's still plenty of fun, but it's like spending time in the Mexico pavilion of EPCOT.

Short version - Tropico 6 is a big step forward compared to its predecessors.

- The game engine is very well optimized and beautifull, however, seeing that at the cost of reducing the number of people crossing the streets. Game runs like a charm on 9 old computer and constant 60fps!

-Antialiasing is far better, and image is much clearer.

- Game is hard and nice (Im only interested in Sandbox modes). There is no casual approach as in other games (all players are treated as losers) l

- Game is rock-stable. No problem at all, but this is expected (game is not new).

- Very nice Random Map Generator (plenty of options). It is the most important option in this TYPE of game. Without it, the games practically does not exist for me.

- Overall: Best Tropico ever.

You can see here the tremendous amount of work involved in T6. The number of available options and possible choices as well as the number of possibilities for shaping your island is huge, but what's nice - optional.

I'm not saying that the content of all DLCs is cost-effective - it depends on you and the place where you live, but it is definitely worth supporting people 

Is there any competition?
The titles, equally refined, but having their own problems and a different approach (more or less the same genre and the pleasure of playing) are:
- Anno 1800 by Ubisoft (cons: lots of paid DLC)
- Transport Fever 2
- The Settlers IV History Edition - by Ubisoft (good old and classic game refreshed by Ubisoft with added multiplayer mode, very cheap)

----------------------------------------------
I am almost 50 years old. I am a total nerd and technical person. I've been playing since 1986. In my accounts I have about 800 games (including about 500 on steam) from all genres of house building, through FPS, RTS, advanced fliight Simulators (like DCS World) etc.

I post this information not to brag to someone, but to reach normal players with this opinion and break through a lot of idiotic threads about freezing computers or people's problems with their own computer and not this game.

Is the game worth the money? The game is worth the price and I will be happy to support the developers in their work by buying all the DLCs, although they will not necessarily make a big difference to me.",1626190886,1626191234,True,11,0,0.666210174560546875,0,True,False,False

This series has always been brutal and forces you to truly understand the mechanics to reach completion. Anyone can pick this up and play but they aren't going to get far without trial and failure.

Wrapped in cartoonish graphics this Dark Souls of city builders is waiting to crush you. The game has never looked this sharp or run so smooth. Bridges are a wonderful edition and effortless to create. I can't think of another sim that handles roads, tunnels, and bridges anywhere near as effectively. As always they deliver on the Latin music. There are many reasons why this is a superior game to its predecessors. If I had to choose only one I'd say that in 5 you couldn't become a true dictator until later in the game as you unlocked the necessities. I found that backwards and it was not designed that way this time.

The game has its pitfalls but most of it is related to story mode being absolutely punishing. Faction requests are non stop and serve more to create anxiety than to serve any purpose. You can ignore most of them the entire time that you play, and their objectives often distract from your goal. I haven't played too much in Sandbox yet but during the story I had a population of around 4k by the final mission. I have a fairly strong gaming rig and had to drop the graphics to low for it hang around 60fps by that time as it began to dip. I felt the mission goals were incredibly difficult and unlikely to be achieved by casual players. 

As always Tropico delivers a game that appeals to everyone as a light hearted city builder. Beneath the hood waits a die hard political nightmare and the slickest interface you will find in a sim. If you had the impression this was a child's game or just another sandbox you haven't been paying attention. More likely you were paying attention and you ran away, because it's not for the faint of heart. It has an appeal in the packaging that sells to the masses, people will claim it's easy to make money, and then hardly anyone will actually complete it. 

I stumbled onto Tropico way back when Civ V released. I had never heard of it, didn't take it seriously, but kept coming back to it. As I dug into the series I couldn't believe how well thought out everything was. It has very deep mechanics lying beneath the surface and once you understand those you truly command the game as a dictator. Tropico games are from that special ether games like Roller Coaster Tycoon are pulled from. 

There is a new company creating Tropico now and they chose not to hold back. Rather, they have double downed on the mission objectives. It is a master piece, for those of us that dare. The final map was a really nice touch. To get there and complete it requires dedication. They chose not to water this down and if you don't believe me, try it.

The game is a city builder (similar to city skylines, Workers and resources, or simcity. it is its own niche similar to these titles) on the surface with a comical political side the Tropico games are known for. The game navigates through 4 eras (colonial, world wars, cold war, and modern [similar to Tropico 4s DLC and tropico 5]) with progressive buildings, foreign relations, and domestic policies/research in each era. In this review i will brake down some of the different parts of the game in order to help you on the process of deciding to buy the game. 

Graphics; 8/10: look at the pictures on the store its about the same 

performance/bugs; 9/10: i play this game on my laptop, and every Tropico game in between back to Tropico 3 on xbox 360 the producers of the game are very attentive to bug fixes, optimization, and general play-ability. 

Developers; 8.5/10: This is one of those few series that has growth in every game and they continue to add content and progress the game with every release. The developers have released DLC that seem unnecessary for their price. However, The price of them rapidly decreases the longer the DLC are out and the company does not compare to the DLC policy of EA or Paradox.

Upgrade from Tropico 5? Easily Yes, I personally think Tropico 5 was arguably the worst Tropico. The features from Tropico 4 dipped massively in exchange for multiplayer. Now it seems that the game has kind of stabilized with the addition of multiplayer and many features from Tropico 4 have returned and are improved. I am excited for what Tropico 7 will look like unless they abandon the series. 

Single player; 7/10: The single player of the game consists of a campaign and sandbox mode. For the sake of simplicity i have always played ""sandbox mode"" as the main game and consider the campaign to be tutorial/challenge mode. This is a great way to learn and play the game. Especially if you are someone that enjoys perfecting your strategy to play online, playing a relaxing game, or taking your anger out as a supreme dictator. 

Multiplayer; 4/10 with randoms, 9/10 with friends: The design of multiplayer is more user friendly than 5 but it is still only the 2nd multiplayer Tropico that has been released. Instead of your territory following your buildings in a sloppy border system like tropico 5. Tropico 6 has them placed into grids that can be purchased with ""swiss bank money"" a ""different currency"" to keep everyone on a levelish playing field for expansion whether a thriving democracy or a communist dictatorship. The community is relatively small but those who do play are abnormally competitive compared to players of other games. That being said if you ever want a friendly person to play with, I always look for more people to play one of my favorite games with.

Customization of character: 4/10 means less than it did in previous games wish they did more with that, a lot more is cosmetic. Still neat i guess. 

Customization of Palace: is decent 6/10

Value for price: Normal price 7/10, on sale 10/10

Obviously i enjoy the Tropico series and games like this so i'm a bit more on the bias side. 

I've never written a review before but this is one of those games that i wish more people played because it truly is a gem in the rough. Hopefully you'll find my review helpful.

I can't really say if its better or worse than tropico 5, but it certainly isn't suited for multiplayer. So if you want to play this game with your friend - don't buy it. It is simply boring. It lacks content and replay value in terms of maps and game modes. Sure, you can upload maps from workshop, but you cant use them in a multiplayer game. Developers just didn't bother to waste their time with proper multiplayer mechanics. Instead, you can buy a useless building and a new costume for your El Pedro for 10 euros.

The communist play too big of a role in the game. During the Dual demands the communist constantly demand the Constitution is changed to total surveilence which tanks your liberty which tanks your approval rating with all other 7 factions.  The dual demands and the Demands of the various factions wear really thin after a few hours.  I also think there is a issue with the balance of income from trade and what it cost to unlock blueprints and build various items the factions demand.  Too many teamsters are required and you just constantly have to be policing every little facet of your island and it becomes a chore rather than a game.  It's more fun to be a dictator that is ruthless and awful for sure.  It's obvious the game works best in this scenario. I'd say 40 % of game mechanics have to do with police piracy and military so if your trying to be benevolent your missing out on a lot of what the game has to offer.

They have updated this game and it is sick now. Reminds me a lot of the good ol days of Tropico 3 with just more stuff you can do.

I have no idea how people are rating this as if its a good installment. It's certainly an improvement from 5, but it still suffers from random and unavoidable economic disasters that put you 300k in the red within minutes, meaning that if you don't have manual a save from a little while back, you're restarting the entire game.
You will spend all fucking night playing this game and building your city on your island, only to watch the bottom fall out of your booming economy once you are about to reach the cold war era. You will be alerted to no reason, you will not be able to find the reason in any of the in-game information, and if you ask the community they will just tell you its either bug or that you're just an idiot.
I fucking hate this game.

I got all the way to the cold war era, had a booming tourism industry, completely electrified island with agriculture, mining, industry, etc. Was making about 100-120k each export period with even more from well-off/rich tourists and banking.

Suddenly, I found myself 50k in the red. Ok, well its probably just a hiccup, then 100k, then 200k, then 300k, then 400k, all within the span of about 30 IRL seconds.

I searched desperately to find out why in the hell I was completely economically paralyzed so suddenly. The almanac had zero answers other than for some unknown reason my job satisfaction had gone all the way down to 5%, the lowest I've ever seen in a Tropico game on any happiness rating. Rich tourists also just stopped showing up to their villas. Why? Nothing in-game could tell me, and they had been a good steady lifeblood of about half of my economy up until literally 3 or 4 minutes before.

There's no excuse for this, as this game has been on full release for a few months now. There's no way for you to forsee these issues, or be warned about them by your adviser, ministers, or agencies. There's no way to find out why they happened so that I can prevent or prepare for them in the future. How are people able to comfortably recommend games like this with glaring issues that are this crippling to the experience of the player?

If you like this awful trend in modern games where they force a player to spend loads of time on reddit asking questions about ""why x happened?"" only to have your questions answered with more questions about all the stuff you've already double and triple checked, then that is the only way I could recommend this game to you.

Maybe Kalypso worked really hard on this game, and it does have a lot of great features, and its certainly head and shoulders above 5...but it still has some of the issues that 5 had that made the game completely unenjoyable for me, so it feels like they aren't listening to players, and it feels like they are just getting something dolled up to roll it out to the sales floor. Ironically enough, this would be right in line with the way they expect their games to be played, which is funny, but it doesn't make me regret my purchase any less.",1568056884,1624932851,True,0,0,0.520096123218536377,0,True,False,False

The Good

- Amazing soundtrack and esthetics. You really feel like a governor of the caraibs and it's honestly really great !

- Quite unique. It differs from all other game with its own identity (maybe city skylines though) 

- Really fresh with all the factions, the great voice acting and the unique eras

- Overrall really solid (16-17/20)

The Middle 

- A bit repetitive. The most interesting missions give you time constraint or send you enemy waves but else it's a walk in the parc... and you kind of end up accomplishing the objectives without real challenge (elections, enemy invasions are really managable)

-  Could use a bit of performance improvement

- Could also use a bit more freshness with dynamic rivals or crimelords. You really feel all powerful... and alone (part from the factions) which ... i get the point but without a nemesis you feel bored

The Bad :

- A LOT of micromanagement once we go sup 1000-1500 tropicans. You can feel the game isn't meant to be played a lot further that point. For instance you can't mass arrest or mass exctinguish fire. It's very clicky, there's not a lot automated for large cities (which isn't that large, like 10-20% of the map built)

- Should improve the colonial era. It's almost a wink to Tropico 2 which i appreciate but there's not enough there. It's almost like you're meant to race to the modern age...

- The combat (and therefore multiplayer) is really lacking. It's a lot better than previously but still far from enough. I want more action ! Else it gets boring

- Very weak and overpriced DLCs... Like, there's a lot more pressant issues to work on before giving me drones honestly... Also, some DLCs are clearly experimental and can ""break the game"" like the export / import DLC",1624924204,1624924204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am just a humble tropican player with not enough Rum in my export and too much coffee from sandy beach farm for some reason. 

Do you like wasting 5 hours on things you just wanna do and forget about the main mission figuring how to make as much money possible ? Then, this is the game for you el presidente. You may not remember about 4 ages since tropico 4. However you feel there are more things to concern about El presidente each ages theres new pesky faction. each ages theres more noisy outsider, at very least they provide us the sweet-sweet money export. 

I think you should always research ""Employee of the month"", we dont understand how to reward someone el presidente. The music is as tropican as always, the beaches are white, so does the king in the country, ofc second to you el presidente. which is money, never ran out of money el presidente.

Is there any coherent point in this review, probably not. the game told me to post a review and i just type for future, El Presidente.  If you enjoyed Tropico Franchise in general.

You like this game you be money well spent on other games that do same thing only better or cheaper such as TRANSPORTATION FEVER, SIMS, LIFE IS FEUDAL, and SURVIVING MARS. To name a few.
What's wrong?  Well nothing much other than same thing as previous versions in fact the quest got more annoying instead of more fun, they added more faction based things.
Freeform has added in some goals that try to stop you building rather than income / popularity / foreign powers used to be almost the key for your downfall. You find yourself now messing with revolutionaries and crown so overall not much difference but income / popularity is almost ignored now got to follow pretty hard set tasks.
Campaigns now filled with pleasing factions rather than keeping your people happy.  In fact gets annoying that the polarity of these factions yet unlike Total War (empires) or Sid Miers games you can't just leave your home country have revolution or something.  Also it's generic imperialist on your 3rd world country how original trope like grade school teacher teaching me about history.

I expected a more robust (or linear? story driven? idk really) campaign instead of just recollections of past adventures of Penultimo and el presidente, it just gives the impression that it is only a sandbox with some pre-configured levels.
All in all a very fun city building game.

Personal story, not review, following.
Year 2019, i was at a business event in a hotel in Athens, at the lobby they had this pianist that played music for the customers of the hotel bar, passing through with 2 colleagues one of them slowed his pace and looked skeptical. ""I recognize this song from somewhere"" he mumbled. i listened for like 2 seconds and immediately recognized the song, Linstead's Motika, ""well have you played Tropico?"" i said, both colleagues immediately opened widely their eyes and shouted ""OMG yes!!"".

Basically ignore human and environmental rights and get that Funfair Pier and circus operational ASAP. The World Wonder Heists make sure you pick one out of four Modifiers per age which has an economic gain and potential loss aspect for global benefits. Personally, I like to play with a bit of North Korea strats one game and Debt Spiral worker's paradise in another. I like the hostile pirate raids and external threats of invasion, but hopefully they'll make it a continuously scaling problem when not resolved instead of 6 squads losing to my forts on ramparts which are OP early game or palace bombing (palace relocation) on top my enemies whenever convenient. The game should add more consequences and the Pirates and invasions are a threat very early game while rebels are just a joke. they just set aflame my factory which is next to a fire station. wow. I miss how the game punishes you in 3 and 4 for being incompetent, but this game makes up for that by having sad workers being lazy. Hopefully later updates could give a rogue state feel when giving the world the middle finger by manipulating the market or arming enemy powers. This game feels a bit made exclusively for new players or those that played 5, but old fans can get some excitement when coping after playing Tropico 4, the best tropico, by playing online with one other player. What this game wants to do is mostly make profits and appeal to your population and the world through trade, which is even more monies being made. Speaking of monies, the colonial era is a great way to make bank and advancing through the ages are trivial.

Although multiplayer will not let you make custom maps that are overall HELL on Earth to make the game more competitive and spicy, single player lets you do that, and for most people, that is enough. There are multiple maps on the workshop that allow you to download Islands to make the game easy or make the game fun.

Good Luck having more than 2 players in a match, the game will crash and the UE4 crash let you know when you can't place roads lol. But if you have 3 friends on VC, get one more schmuck to join the game, not vc, and bully them in Cold War, try not to let it crash too early.

If they should add some things, more hostiles invading, embargoes actually doing something and decreasing export prices significantly unless in an alliance with the winning powers and add a rebel yell option to make the game spicier. But this game is made with UE4, don't know why, but it takes cajones to make an RTS Simulator with that engine",1623982072,1623982072,True,9,0,0.600583732128143311,0,True,False,False

* Most bugs are fixed now
* A lot of fun campaign maps. Most are fairly simple even on hard though but some face a bit of a challenge
* The AI and pathfinding makes you think more where and how you place stuff
* Lots of varied structures to build with tons of benefits to your citizens.
* A great fun city builder with much more focus on quests and story than all other builder games i have played, the missions maps are what makes the game fun. 

The bad:
* Some edicts are really bad. Some are nearly mandatory
* Without commando set to spam ""threaten neighbors"" some maps are super hard. Its has such a huge impact on 
what you need to build for your citizens to vote for you that without it id say going from easy to hard in difficulty has less impact on the actual difficulty than the commando spam. For you that haven't played it reduces the Caribbean happiness which your citizens compares to when they vote. It can be between 50-80 without and stays at 30-45 with. 
* The factions spam demands  which you don't even have to do since they only give a temporary boost or penalty. If you stay above 40 and got good happiness you can just dismiss all of them

This is the first game in Tropico series that is worse than the previous ones. Tropico was a steady, if slow, march forward with each iteration adding new content and not messing to much with existing mechanics. Unfortunately part six broke the cycle. The witty humor is almost completely gone, replaced with bland comments and dictator factoids. Research flattened to unlocking exactly one building modes, regime tool or constitution option. Raids and stealing landmarks feel forced but admittedly are the brightest new point. Bridges and boats are a nice addition but by no means a game-changer. Managing separate islands is more of a chore and annoyance than improvement. To add insult to injury DLCs are so lackluster I am not even considering buying them.

Overall Tropico 6 is not bad, it is still a Tropico game with core gameplay fun as ever. However I cannot recommend it in good conscience, it feels like devs didn't have a plan and rushed the game just to get it over with.

Very limited gameplay and extremely limited amount buildings. it especially sucks when you advance in eras in this game and you can reach the year 2030 and you still have only a couple of residential building types and designs and only one of each leisure or fun building type. If this game was inspired by cuba then even cuba has already opened up and if its presidente was inspired by fidel then even fidel has already died while in this edition of the game el presidente never dies starting from the colonial era up until eternity you play with the same presidente and same advisers and so on.

Almost all the mission cities you start with, are already built up quite far, when I would have actually preferred to build them myself from the scratch. I think that's kind of the point and the magic of building games. But you can obviously sandbox the game as much as you want so there's that. There's no campaign, just these single missions that are more like scenarios where you jump in and try to solve some problems and tasks that are thrown at you. Most missions are very easy on the normal difficulty and then there's couple that really gave me trouble and took several re-trys.

The soundtrack is unfotunately the weakest in my opinion from all the other Tropicos through 3 to 5 that I've played. At some point I muted the music and just wanted to listen to something else, when with the previous games I felt exactly the opposite, I even listened to some of their soundtracks from Youtube even when I wasn't playing the games.

Nevertheless, the actual gameplay is so far easily the best. They have a bunch of new features and buildings and they've also brought back some of those that I liked which were cut from previous games for some reason. There's a literal ton of upgrades and work modes on all buildings and sometimes it felt it might even be a bit too much micromanagement. For some reason and unfortunately most of the edicts don't feel like they have a meaningful purpose except for pleasing whatever political party you want to please, at the expense of displeasing some other(s). You could be just fine without ever using any of them. At least the constitutions are quite well planned.

The game runs very very smoothly on ultra graphics and I don't think I experienced any bugs at all. Just a couple of inconvenient UI features here and there but no big deals.

The humor is as funny and absurd as ever and the voice acting is pretty good and the political and economical stereotypes are spot on.

It took me 65 hours to finish all the ""campaign"" missions and I had a pretty good time doing so, so at the sale price of 20 € which I got it for, I can easily recommend this game as it is a solid Tropico game, no doubt.",1621605892,1621605892,True,3,0,0.544705629348754883,0,True,False,False

Add Original Soundtrack to Tropico 6. I understand that time has moved on and so must the music, but if it aint moving for the better or at least can't top over the original then make it an Option for the players to be able to listen to the original soundtrack.

I really wanted to like this game, but it still feels like an early access game that is never going to be finished. The AI is worse that previous Tropicos, your soldiers are morons running around like headless chickens, sometime it completely bugs and you get attacked, but your soldiers don't even go out of the fort because the event is not in the top right corner of the event list, meanwhile pirates just wreck your buildings. A+ design. Customization of your leader and palace is a joke, a lot of visual bugs(ships clip through bridges, people are running on a bridge, while also are in red boats). you cannot select incoming cargo ships anymore to see what they are importing or exporting. Ships and vehicles don't have collision. You don't have dynasty anymore, nor can assign supervisors to buildings. The random map generator need work too, sometimes the islands don't make any sense as half of the island is cut by a plateau and you cannot built a road or remove it. The raid missions feel very uninspired and sometimes you will just get a delay after delay without having an option to do anything about it just wait 720 days and then why don't you just wait another 720 days for the lols.

In fact, my *only* issue with it, so far, is the mission system 

Rather than a cohesive single player storyline to drive your gameplay, each mission is an entirely separate experience, usually opened with a nostalgic monologue from Penultimo. I realize this is a throwback to Tropicos roots, but I had really gotten into the narratives of 4 & 5, and was hoping for something similar in 6 

I suppose my only other complaint, and this is likely a personal problem, is the difficulty. I find that even on easy I have trouble, and it's problematic that you automatically lose when you hit $50,000 in debt; seems to me that it should be $100,000 or $150,000, but maybe that's just me

I originally thought this was going to be a game about playing a tyrannical dictator and horribly abusing your populace while generally being a minor annoyance to the rest of the world in general. What it turned out to be was a neat city building game where you can play pretty much however you want to. You can exploit the land for short-term gain or build a self-sustaining commune, focus on wealth or happiness (or if you're good at it, both), choose to tyranically oppress your populace or give them all the amenities they can afford. Each different style of city has different challenges and rewards.

All in all it's a pretty good game. Worth more than what i paid on special.

OK, I take that back, I had a chance to play Tropico 5 briefly for free and decided to pick up Tropico 6 while it was on sale because I wanted to play with the new hotness instead of old and busted. Because I don't have any experience with the older versions, I don't have as much to be disappointed about, it seems. There are some tricky moments with logistics and transportation that need serious finagling to overpower what behaves like an overly pedantic A/I at times, but once you get how the game ""thinks"", you can plan ahead for it. So, that being said...

I absolutely LOVE this game. Let's start with the slapping salsa soundtrack which keeps me chair dancing, especially when my missions are going well (I'm Latina so it doesn't hurt to have some game music to which I can really relate). 

The variety of mission types and challenges is good, the degree of difficulty is up to you, and there are a lot of nuanced and subtle adjustments that enhance enjoyment and dramatically influence outcome. If you're familiar with city builders, you know this. But if you're not, I think you're in for a real treat on this one.

The graphic is quite beautiful even when my setting isn't at Ultra. A lot of way to generate income, through tourist, farming, or mining.
This game is more relaxing, we don't have to manage traffic like the other city building game.
What I hope for this game is:
1. More variation for the building. Some building like Office only have 1 variation and if you build it alot, it kinda repetitive. Also, it would be great if we can select the texture of some building. I just don't like the Modern Mansion have grungy walls.
2. Description more detailed. The juice building have a workmode of mixing 2 fruits. What I don't understand is how it affect the output. Does it more efficient? Does consuming 2 fruit at once only create 1 unit of juice? etc.

But there are some points I would be noting down here. This game has ridiculuous amounts of waiting in it. Even with 4x time speed, some stuff just needs you to wait for 2-3 in-game years. Of course, you can focus on some other stuff while waiting, but especially in the defined missions, sometimes only thing you need to do is waiting time to pass.

Where this game was about to be fun, waiting takes the joy away. So my playtime till now is basically to see all the content in the game through the missions. Man, there are tonnes of content here, that's really amazing. And also tonnes of different ways to play the game. Maybe sandbox without limitations would makes more sense for this particular title.

It's one of the best city building sims out there with fun political twits and game mechanics. Missions, scenarios, sandbox modes are all good and challenging. Developers have put out plenty of updates and add ons so there is plenty of newness to the game. Only downfall is, even though its been promised by the developers almost 2 yrs ago, no map editor. This prevents the player from really building their dream island. The sand box mode allows you to create randomize maps but must of the time you have to go through more than 10, 15 generated maps to find the one that is close enough to what you would want.

Not all produced good options work and that is a weakness I think, this way the game forces you to produce certain items if you want to avoid making a loss.
The mechanics are somewhat unexplained as well. There's no warning if a lot of your people die due to absent health care in the colonial age, not does the game help you with any advice.

You have the choice of being the good guy or going full authoritarian, and neither are easy on higher difficulty. You will struggle to keep opposing factions happy with you.

I'm personally not a huge fan of the EULA, but you can hardly find games these days that aren't 'license to play' and not an 'owned copy play as your heart desires even if we decide to completely discontinue supporting the game.'

The story is pretty basic, but in a good way.

There are a few bugs, but nothing too game-breaking. My only major issue is randomly generated maps generating areas with tons of resources that are inaccessible to vehicles, so you can't really get to them without airports (Caribbean Skies DLC), which take up a lot of space.

And another thing: I don't completely get DLC. I never have. But, that's a rant for another day. I'd like to keep this review short. If you end up liking Tropico 6, get the Caribbean Skies DLC for drones and cargo airports if you have the funds to do that, they're extremely useful.",1617616164,1617616164,True,0,0,0,6,True,False,False

So, part of the above review was from my experience playing while a bunch of bugs were in still in effect and having residual fallout from that. When I went back and found out what I felt wasn't quite right, I was still frustrated. So, in the Tropicoland mission, there is a part where you have to build 3x3 parks on four different islands. Well, they have two different 3x3 parks and only one activates the requirements to complete that step of the mission. Turns out the multiple times I've tried to do this mission, I've been choosing the 3x3 park ""conveniently placed"" at the end of the decorations tab. That is not the park that completes the mission.

The game is solid and offers a unique theme to the city builder genre. Placing things (buildings, roads, ect.) feels really good and you can normally get things just how you want them. Biggest problem with the game is a stall late game which can make sandbox mode feel unfulfilling.

This game is challenging, fun, and has an excellent learning curve. After spending hours and hours making new island after new island I still love this game. The campaign is fun and a challenge too.

Pros:
Resource management is fun and seems balanced
Controls are pretty good 
Time passes in a fair way
Good campaign and sandbox mode

Cons:
Road snapping can be annoying
Military can be derp and not do anything while you're being attacked
Attacks- sometimes they are rare other times it is one after another for no reason

I have played Tropico 4 and 5, and I'd say 6 has mostly added, not taken away. I'm sure there are tons of DLC for 5 that never got ported over, but I was never big on collecting all the DLC of a game, anyway.  Comparing to the other games, I'd say this is a very decent addition with lots of replay value and difficult scenarios to try.

But here's the main issue with this game, and it will probably put a lot of people off. I'll keep it simple as I can: This game doesn't explain anything nearly as well as it should.
I've skimmed the forums, and based on my personal experiences as well, a lot of difficulty and confusion comes up from one or more of the following:
""My citizens aren't doing what I want them to do""
""I am getting constantly attacked and my army can't defend me""
""My economy is completely screwed and I have no idea why.""
There's answers to all these questions, but don't expect any help from the absolutely MEAGER in-game descriptions and tutorials. Usually there is no way to know what you are doing wrong, period. most players have figured out how to play this game through quite a lot of trial and error, and some bugginess has made the general confusion worse.

Ok, so why the hell am I actually recommending this game? Well, I'll tell you my last playthrough. Like most colonies, I started off rough, then started to pick up my economy. Eventually I overextended myself and got into a financial crisis, and pulled myself out of that tooth-and-nail. That was a great feeling, because the next hour or two of gameplay, I was winning, and everything was too easy. I thought about restarting on a harder difficulty, because I had more money than I knew what to do with, I had stolen 3 world monuments, I was advancing in ages faster than reality (I ended the cold war era around 1960!)

And then, it stopped. My economy tanked. I thought I was growing steadily and then it messed up drastically. The worst part, I had no idea why the things I had been doing stopped working suddenly. My workers never seemed to work, my teamsters weren't transporting goods, I was blowing cash trying to keep them happy but they started rebelling as the population outgrew the infrastructure, and here I was, too strapped for cash to effectively expand....

Can you guess what I did wrong? it took a while searching forums, googling, looking at guides, and eventually I understood. My workers had simply stopped working because.... they were too busy having fun. What the heck? I assumed these little civilians worked on a set schedule, but no, they work when they need the money. If they have too much money, and the entertainment is plentiful and cheap, they will simply never go to work.

That, well, wasn't exactly explained anywhere. Or I had missed it, or it got lost in all the jokes and ironic comments from the advisers, and I mistook it as some kind of joke. It's certainly ridiculous. But it's just one of the problems that are so easy to overlook and misunderstand in this game, that I'm not even sure I actually know how to fix the problem, other than demolishing all my nifty entertainment buildings. I'll figure it out, but I didn't even know that this was a mechanic of the game.

So, yeah, that's one example. I've had other times where I was totally confused as to what to do, and only found answers from other players, on forums and such. This game tells you all about your camera controls and which menu is for what, but fails to actually explain the core gameplay. That's ok, I guess. I'm still going to play the hell out of it, and keep achieving and failing spectacularly. It's really fun, if you can get into to.",1616258159,1616258159,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The almanac is also a good tool for judging where you're at. Worker numbers, income, expense, hapyness. Everything you need to know (in theory).

However tropico also does not give you enough info. There are things that are completely non-intuitive. You can see that your people are all happy, above the caribean avarage, yet you're constantly invaded by rebels. Why? IDK. People are happy, but some dude doesn't have a local radio station so he decides to go all Allahu Ahbar on your car factory.

Despite being the sixth entry in the series, and being built directly from Tropico 5, Tropico 6 still feels like a beta.

Multiple mechanics either are not explained or simply do not work as you are told they work. While in theory the game brings a lot to the table, many potentially fun builds are unworkable while what does work is too 'gamey' to live up to the very theme heavy selling point.

Tropico 4 is cheap, and its only major flaw is it is too easy, which can be addressed in the sandbox settings. Other city builder series do not have the charm of El Presidente, but have their act together as games.",1583063193,1614236743,True,0,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

492720,87200239,76561198006667939,0,2,5857,0,1066,1651830426,"I have (amazingly, and perhaps sadly) had some of the most fun moments in my life in Tropico. Especially in one of the earlier iterations of the game, Tropico 3. Ever since I decided to give Tropico 4 a try, I have searched for the same fun moments with that particular and enjoyable Tropican flair. Unfortunately the game developers have so far not been able to recreate that, let alone, as I had hoped for, improve on it. Tropico 6 is a breath of fresh air in the series after what I consider the ""detour"" of Tropico 5. I'll give some details about the crucial successes and failures of the series and how that is reflected in Tropico 6. 

Before I start, I'll say that if you are new to Tropico, I 100% recommend buying this game. It makes you think about how the world works, it looks beautiful, and it is just very fun. If you are a long-term fan of the Topico franchise, I also recommend it, but this game does not recreate the atmosphere of Tropico 3. It is, though, a significant improvement on Tropico 5. 

First of all, what was so great about Tropico 3 was the atmosphere among the people. I felt like I could be on the same side as the relaxed, fun-loving Tropicans, who lived on a tropical paradise island. What they wanted was to have a nice life, a nice home, and to be able to have a glass of rum on the beach in the early evening. I was THEIR presidente, one of them. Even if I built a factory to strengthen the economy, it was painful for me as well as for them to ruin the island paradise. But they also had strong opinions. If you did something against the best of the people, they complained and may even become rebels, taking up arms against you and trying to kill you. I loved their strong dedication to their rights and their freedom. With the 'Modern Times' expansion of Tropico 4, this became less important. In Tropico 5 it was completely gone. They population were fast-walking robots with no personalities. There were rebellions, but it felt like you just went through the motions with fighting the rebellions. Even though the new developers, Limbic, have put more of a focus on the well-being of the population again, this is still missing too much from Tropico. 

A second essential aspect of the important atmosphere in Tropico 3 were the radio hosts. Betty Boom and Juanito were the life of the party, the beating hearts of Tropican culture. No matter what you did, good or bad, Betty Boom came on air a few minutes later and critized it as a capitalist plot. This was the polar opposite of the ""always good news-approach"" of Juanito, who only had good things to say about El Presidente. This also fit perfectly with the setting of the game, which started in 1950, a time when ""everyone"" listened to the radio. Radio was how people got their news and entertainment, and it shaped people's opinion. The developers of games 3, 4 and 5, Haemimont, tried to develop this aspect after Tropico 3. In game 4, only Juanito was present, but by game 5, the two original hosts had been replaced. Lola, the new radio host who broadcasted from a bar on a hidden beach somwehere, added both hidden and obvious sexual scenarios to the radio broadcasts that were triggered by your constructions and policies. I liked Lola, she was fun, and brought something new to Tropico. But she was not even in the same league as Betty Boom. In Tropico 6, your vice president, Penultimo makes some announcements based on what you construct or what policies you enact, but it is always a dry defense of big politics actions, spoken as if being said to people who are too stupid to understand they are being tricked. Betty Boom would have ripped him to shreds and eaten the pieces for breakfast. 

A third aspect, which perhaps sounds trivial but has a big impact on my immersion in the game is the speed at which people in Tropico 6 walk. Even at normal game speed (1x), NPC's walk at what looks like full sprint. This aspect was introduced in Tropico 5, and Limbic has chosen to stick with it. One of the things I liked about Tropico 3 and 4 was that people on the island walked at a normal, or even slow, pace. When they were not working, they meandered. Since the work mode on the Teamster building, for instance, was described as ""A standard 14-hour day of back-breaking labour and merriment"", it made sense to me that as soon as they were off the clock, they walked slowly to enjoy the few breaks a 14-hour work day gave. Most jobs in Tropico 3 did not give much job satisfaction, so I enjoyed that this, and the hot climate, was reflected in that people walked at a casual, or even slow, pace, to give the bosses the middle finger and demonstrate how life should be lived. Not at a breakneck pace, but with a glass of rum on the beach. You may work 14 hours a day but they will not take your soul. This attitude made me feel close to Tropicans. This is completely missing from the high speed, seemingly soulless robots in Tropico 5 and 6. 

I have saved the best for last. El Presidente. That is you, in the game. In Tropico 3, El Presidente is a father to the people. He is the bad guy when someone needs to be the bad guy. He is the warm, comforting hero when things seem stressful. If you simply click on El Presidente's avatar, he gives a quip that is both confrontational and hilariously warm. For instance, ""What? I'm busy ruling!"" El Presidente's election speeches would make anyone feel better about the future, even if it is a lie based on another lie. In Tropico 5, which was a big break in style and a complete re-doing of the game, El Presidente was simply cold and evil. If you clicked on his avatar now, he would say things like ""Fear me and obey"". The atmosphere had completely changed. The voice actor was different, which may not even be a problem, except that El Presidente was now a different creature. This was a sad move for the series, and took away something very meaningful from the game. In Tropico 6, the voice actor seems to be the same as in game 5, but the tone is slightly changed back towards warm and funny. It is possible to give election speeches again, which is a very good step. But the tone and atmosphere of El Presidente has still removed one of the essential aspects of how the series was made a success with Tropico 3. YOU are El Presidente in the game. So his or her personality is essential to the game. This still needs fixing to get the game back on track to being a real successor to Tropico 3 and 4.

Don't get me wrong. I have a lot of criticism simply because I really, really care about this game. Tropico 6 is a really fun and good game, and unlike Tropico 5 it may be worth buying at full price. But, having said that, I would still wait for a sale. The essence of Tropico is the atmosphere, alongside the significant political and economic simulations. I have probably played more than 1000 hours of Tropico if you count all the iterations. I say with confidence that Tropico 6 is the best game in the series when it comes to the political and economic simulations. BUT, and it is a BIG BUT, it still comes short when it comes to atmosphere. I love the Tropico-games because I loved the atmosphere in Tropico 3. Every time I play Tropico 6 (or 5) in my head I still hear Betty Boom, Juanito, the original El Presidente, and reminisc about simply clicking on an inhabitant of Tropico meandering the streets, to hear him or her say ""Que occure?"" and see how they are doing. Atmosphere is essential in Tropico, that's what it's all about.  Buy Tropico 6 on a sale, everyone who is interested in computer games should play Tropico, but keep in mind that this game is an iteration in a series, and that it still needs some work (and not in a DLC, please, developers).",1613959624,1613959624,True,21,0,0.745380401611328125,0,True,False,False

Still I am finding my way around the new interface looking for information I used to know exactly where to find, but overall, I find the new updated interface to be more intuitive after getting used to the structure.

Very minor, camera movement seems a bit more restricted than it used to be, but perhaps that is me not fully understanding the new controls and trying to use it like the older version I have played for so long. Again though, this is a minor point and not really a problem, just a preference based on familiarity.

The new mechanics such as multiple islands to inhabit, and more direct control of transportation lines, etc are all welcome additions. I have not uninstalled version 4, and likely I will go back and play there more still. However, I don't expect version 4 to have the luster it once had for me now that I am getting spoiled by version 6.

My overall verdict is, great update to a great game, even my favorite series among city builders with its quirky sense of humor and great soundtrack.",1613518275,1613518275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playthrough for all the missions was ~90hrs to me (mostly fun. like. 95%).
The game is witty, fun to play, entertaining. Amazing music, great VO (voice over) and well addressed irony on politics and how grotesque ""the world works"". Kudos for that.

A lot of things if not the whole game is a little sketchy. It's more a board game on steroids rather than a strategy game - but (hence the upvote) with a lot of charm.


Negatives, so you know:
[list]
[*] all the small and annoying things: the [b]horrible[/b] quality of pathfinding of road building (it's a shame, really...), VO interruptions, i.e. 'overrides' by a new, one liner VO popped by a UI action

[*] the lack of a knowledge base or in-game encyclopedia or something. So any issues come up, one has to google. Issues accoring to that e.g. Colosseum's function goes for the calculations only, if anything is in red which one would think doesn't matter (e.g. Faith Happiness), rebellions left and right.
But the worst was tunnel building. It turned out it's a thing how the tunnel is rotated when one tries to place it: the end closer to the mouse icon is the exit, the other end goes inside the hill. An arrow or something could have indicated that, I assumed rotation doesn't matter, it's two tunnel ends after all. But it does...

[*] A lot of information is hidden: e.g. finance details, teamsters' average / actual load, reason for turning 'rebel', etc)

[*] A lot of inconsistencies: e.g. plantations have to be micro-managed (they get ""depleted""), raw materials can be (kinda) managed but shouldn't be, mine / building / etc priority cannot be, as human resources are auto-assigned and cannot be overriden

[*] Faction (and broker, etc) demands are totally random. They ask the same things in a row, they ask for thing one already did so cannot do again (e.g. alliance with a state), Environmentalists ask for coal power plant... The whole thing is just lazy

[*] Trading is also totally random. Sometimes one can buy things from a power discounted, and sell it back with profit, sometimes the main export items never come up as a trade option, amounts are not very well balanced, etc. Sloppy stuff

[*] ""The Referendum"" map is MEH, I hate time pressure

[*] The map after that is even worse, it feels like the control over the game is out of the player's hand. It wasn't fun
[/list]

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*] Speeches are back.
[*] More islands on one map.
[*] Trading is more efficient.
[*] Improvement on building and exterior designs, such as being able to decorate the palace with way more options than any Tropico game.
[*] Can re-position the palace anywhere on the map.
[*] There is no dynasty system (I personally like that they excluded this, but some may feel different).
[*] Consistent updates to improve game mechanics (They finally fixed the rebels and army behavior!)
[*] Offers just about everything you'd expect from a Tropico game. 
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[*] The overall visuals/graphics are not an upgrade from Tropico 5.
[*] Expect to see tons of small DLC at premium prices like there was for Tropico 5.
[*] Once you reach the Modern Era, there isn't much else to do. There isn't much incentive, and depending on how well you set up your island financially wise, the game will just play itself.

All-in-all, this is a pretty solid Tropico game, with some pretty minor cons. Like I said, if you like the Tropico series, you will like this game.",1588048368,1611862062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have a lot of possibilities. You have to learn the game for quite some time to get a bit of the hang of it. It can be hard to upkeep your city or to find out what you need to do at times, a lot of things happen at once which is nice if you like fastpace gaming but it can also give a lot of pressure into decision making.

- Graphics: 8/10 (simple but still well done)
- Gameplay 8/10 (it can be really hard at times but it's still a lot of fun)
- Multiplayer 6/10 (you don't get a lot of options, you just play on the same map but that's it)
- Diversity 7/10 (i'd like to see more maps and more options on multiplayer)

- Rating 7/10, there's a lot happening, if you like your building games with an extra touch of running it and making the right decision (or perhaps the wrong one) this is deff the game for you. You can spend hours on it. If you looking for multiplayer I'd advice you to skip this.

I saw that there were many mechanics missing from the last one, such as there being bridges and multiple islands. Finally, the game was on Steam. When I first checked it out, it costed $50. When I found that out, I decided to buy it when it was on sale. Today, I remembered the winter sale was ending soon, so I got whatever I could on my wishlist. When I saw this game, it was around half price. Without hesitation, I got it. Long story short, it was worth it. It lived up to my expectations: witty dialogue, good humor, and fun gameplay.

Arranging your city to be efficient and beautiful is a challenge at every turn. There are only 3 things about this game that i do not like. Learning the detailed tricks to the game is trial and error, because there are a lot of time the game does not fully explain some of the features. For example: if you have a rum distillery, how much sugar does it use to produce X amount of rum. Well, without placing one and watching it for 5 minutes you don't know. Second is the starting situation. There are 5 buildings that you must have for tropico to begin and the game always gives you the same setup, so i find myself spending half of my starting money to relocate every building and then a few game months waiting for the recently unemployed to have to walk to wherever. A neat way to fix that might be similar to every other RTS where as you start the game it's, paused and asks you to place the 5 buildings that you need to function. Finally, there are only 9 multiplayer maps and none on the workshop, so if you play with friends, it will get super repetetive, BUT.....

None of these negatives outweigh how much fun the game is. The actual game is AMAZING. Sure it lacks some quality of life things when building, but after a few hours or so of gameplay, you get used to how to overcome that. The graphics are beautiful, the music is groovy, and there are several paths to success, so you don't have to play the exact same way each time. Did i mention the graphics are stellar? Find this game on sale to make it worth the purchase though. If i was going to pay $50 for a game and full price for every DLC, i would expect those quality of life improvements. 

Overall 4.5/5
Music 6/5
Graphics 5/5
City Management 4.5/5 (only lacking better explanations of functions)",1609780950,1609780950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I still have the same complaints described in my original review, below, but I also have a deeper understanding of what the game sets out to be.

There are a lot of complex, intricate systems to manage simultaneously, which  makes it so addictive for me. 

I also think the quality of the voice acting and overall polish deserves much more credit than I gave in my original review.

Finally, the updates since then have corrected a lot of minor problems and added some nice features like emergency routes for teamsters. The most recent DLC was a fairly solid addition to the game.

If you're on the fence about giving the game a try, go for it. You won't be disappointed.

Original review:

While there is a lot to like about Tropico 6, there are a few problems that tip this review toward the negative. Full disclosure: this is my first Tropico 6 game. I play a lot of other city-building, management, and sandbox games, but this is my first time with Tropico.

I played through all the tutorials and the first campaign map. After that, I wanted to try some sandbox games with easy settings just to become familiar with the game mechanics, systems, etc. Here are some things I observed that rob the game of the fun factor.

I feel like I'm on rails. I don't have much agency. Too many of the choices I make come down to ""do this or lose the game."" The loss might come gradually, or it may come quickly. 

Don't get me wrong--I'm not complaining about challenge. But there's a difference between challenge and events that just create an artificial drag on your economy or progress. If I lose the game because I made unwise choices--spent to fast, didn't build enough of a certain type of building, or whatever, that's great. There should be consequences, but those consequences should be avoidable by making the right choices.

For example, one of the factions demands that I build a high school. If I say no, I push myself closer to losing the next election or whatever. The problem is, I had just invested a ton of time and hassle into heisting the wonder that provides automatic high school education to all new citizens. So, I didn't need the high school, but I had to purchase the blueprint and build one anyway or else sacrifice the faction approval. 

There doesn't seem to be much room for gameplay where you get to decide to focus on some aspect of the game like tourism or military power. Instead, you basically just have to follow whatever the RNG demands throw at you while balancing everything else. 

Give the player some more freedom. There's a ton of delicious complexity that goes to waste because, in each game I've played (supposedly sandbox), there's really only one path forward. And in other cases, even good choices are indirectly penalized.",1580247364,1609776607,True,0,0,0.63937842845916748,4,True,False,False

On the negative side, I think the world wonders are stupid because they make the game less realistic and are too powerful and I wish there were at least the same quality of statistics as there was back in Tropico 1. The game could do a better job telling the player what is going on. Like, why am I being attacked by rebels even though I have an approval rating in the mid 90s?

But still, the designers did a good job with the advancement through the ages (colonial, world wars, cold war and mondern times) and I also think the categorization of people into wealth classes was a good idea.

Unlike 4, this one requires a lot of strategy and budgeting. Like, if you try to go all dictator in the early eras, your're gonna have a bad time. It's VERY easy, to go bankrupt and would be political suicide. The AI, is very sensitive and unpredictable. Obviously, with every era change the AI will adjust accordingly. Some people hate this, however I love it because it makes each era standout and forces you to adapt political changes. Also, having basic knowledge in politics is a must in order to truly enjoy this game... Lots historical undertones with funny contexts. Just like in real life, dictatorships are a gradual outcome. That said, if you intend to play the long game and build up gradually, it can be a very entertaining banana republic simulator!

Not much to say about the positives, for the first time almost all aspects of Tropico since the 3rd installment are great and balanced. Lots of quality of life improvements, good UI, great graphics, interesting missions, music great as always.
Enough freedom to play the politics to your liking and create the democracy or dictatorship you like.

On the list of negatives there's things like a lack of explanations on game features or missing in-depth description of important game mechanics which becomes obvious to avid city planners when the logistics of the city become somewhat complex. Or that some features are hidden in the UI (it's not intuitive at all on how to prohibit export of something). Personally I miss some more history economy graphs. The heist mechanic also bugs me a bit, as it is extremely easy to get those buildings and they offer very strong buffs. I find it highly unbalanced.
The bigger negative (compared to previous versions) however is El Presidente. The avatar played a much bigger role in previous games and the family concept was odd at first but nice. In T6 the avatar is basically useless. He or she just runs around on their own and there are no interesting perks to be used. They could have cut it all together and I wouldn't notice any difference.

My only minor complaint is that missions are not spelled out too well. You are playing and playing without really knowing what the end goal is. But that is very minor.
Graphics, building, etc all well done. Even the humor is well played.

It's not perfect, no Tropico game is, but it keeps the same undoubtable charm as the previous instalments. If you liked the others, then this is certainly the best Tropico game in recent years, in my opinion.

So what does it do right?
The catchy Latino music, humour, stunning graphics and addictive game-play are second to none, really. There's no doubting that it's a Tropico game through and through, and this goes in its favour. The maps, although not massively diverse, are an improvement over previous games and for the first time allow you to rule more than one island, which makes it a lot more interesting. There's a good balance between humour and silliness and real, serious game-play mechanics.

What doesn't it do well?
It's somewhat buggy and in places rough around the edges. Although not unexpected in games these days, some have been a bit ridiculous in my opinion, and some still seem to go unfixed. Thankfully these issues have been minor.
Some faction demands seem very watered down and repetitive compared to previous games, and are largely meaningless demands, such as ""build another cocktail bar near our embassy"", which makes diplomacy a bit weak sometimes.
The customisation options, especially for El Presidente aren't the best, and are largely novelties at best.",1608305244,1608305244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the Tropico franchise all the way back to sneaking the original onto my workplace desktop, and I really wanted to like T6.  It's gleaming and polished...and it's lost its heart.  Improvements over T5 include discontinuing the ludicrous overarching, absurdly time traveling narrative for the scenarios.  Each scenario now stands alone as it should.  The equally ludicrous dynasty system is dust.  (Might could have been reformed, but if the choice is keep the old or get rid of it, then they made the right choice.)  Now you just modify your president and palace at will, suggesting the presidency quietly changes hands cordially over the century of game play.

Looking back, I have to ask...where are the papayas?  Quietly scuttled out of T5...some Europeans outsmarted themselves to think papayas no longer belong in the menu of crops for a game set in Latin America.  Ok, so I rarely ever planted them before and don't ask for unrealistic gimmicks to bump the export price.  But they were *there*...because this was Tropico.  Maybe the right idea was to figure out a new lateral mechanic to keep it in the setting, rather than erase it from existence and keep stretching this franchise ever further into realistic graphics and cartoony politics?

The soundtracks have lost their soul, and to the tune of bleached latin music to hypnotize me I'm sending out 3rd world pirates to steal the Wonders of the World like the Bond spoof ""Evil Genius.""

The character set up has swung violently from overly complicated to too simple.  The old Tropicos had it perfect already, you know?  (It's too bad it's we live in the age of the Bizzarro version of the Red Scare: snowflake PC paranoia and so we're deprived the menu of history's Latin American Rogues Gallery.)

Sick to *death* of Penultimo.  Sick of the same old characters whose attire and diction are misplaced for their era.  Sick to death of all the gringos --make that 'individuals of European ancestry of whom the North American variety Latin American folks historically made the effort to translate 'verde vete' into English, [thanks for such a thorough language filter, Steam!]--who for some reason are half the faction leaders of my Latin American country?  I appreciate the effort and guiding principle of Tropico that it makes fun of everybody.  (Credit where credit is due: the EU ambassador makes me laugh out loud.)  That doesn't require nonsensical characters for the setting to accomplish.

Instantaneous roads and bridges requiring no construction and no upkeep.  You see?  This is even more science fiction than stealing the Eiffel Tower.  After 4 sequels in the franchise, has anyone in this label even been to Latin America?

Back in the old days I was asked to micromanage wages and the rising tide of inflation was permanently instilled in my nervous system.  Now you just 5-star your businesses, cozy up to the Broker (who does all your bribery for you,) and you can't lose.  So don't worry, there's no reason for you to miss the almanac data prior to the 12 months.   [eye roll]  Don't expect these developers to offer you enough information on unit production and conversions to make informed decisions on product processing, either.

It breaks my heart to thumbs down Tropico.  But it's lost its way.

I recently acquired Tropico 6 for the Nintendo Switch. There was lots of great functionality, the graphics were.. decent, and the game-play was fantastic! Unfortunately, the game may be a little to powerful for the switch, and I had some continuous crashing, and heavy ""laggy"" game-play. I already have a pretty beefy gaming laptop, so I decided to download Tropico 6 from Steam. 

Since the download from steam, I've had nothing short of a great time. There is tons of options, lots of fantastic things to do, and on top of that, I can be the dictator I always wanted to be. I highly recommend this game to anyone that's looking to build a city, world, army, and have lots of freedom within this game. I was a huge fan of Age Of Empires (AOE) when I was younger, and this definitely brings back a lot of memories, although it is different, it does have similar aspects.

Please be aware to check your settings. If your computer can handle it, you can increase max population to 10,000, although, in the 6 hours I've been playing on ""Large"" map, I have roughly 6,000 inhabitants/tourists, and my Island is slap full, but do take a look at the settings, and see what may or may not be to your liking. For people that haven't played, you can change the look of your ""El Presidente"". 

I do want to cover a couple things quickly, I don't want this to be a long drawn out review, I want this easy and straight to the point. You can issue edicts, for example, you can choose the ""Free Car"" edict, and give out free cars to inhabitants. You can create a metro or bus station so people can travel throughout the island. You can issue trade routes with different countries. Yes, you do have a Swiss Bank Account for all those shady deals you may perform. You CAN and will be attacked by other counties, and guerilla fighters. It's just part of the game, but why not set up your barracks, army base, or aircraft carrier to take them out. Someone looked at you wrong? Send people to arrest, kill, or institutionalize him. Think he can change his mind? Give him a bribe. Want to build relationships with the church going folk? Build More! Buildings catching on fire? Build a fire station, as you progress, upgrade it to have a helicopter. I did forget to mention - you can upgrade buildings as you progress. You can also choose how much money to continue paying your workers from low to high, but they will have to be paid something. You can build bridges connecting islands, but the bridges can't be very long, if the islands are to far apart, you will need to just build a dock on the other island and people can get there that way.

Tourists will be beneficial to your island, so make sure to build an airport, or tourist dock when you can. They spend money, they go to casinos, arcades, theaters, etc. Tourists will be a great source of income. On top of that, you can build plantations for about 10 different types of things, such as tobacco, and cocoa. You can set up a woodcutting camp, and then you can make a facility to turn the logs to planks. You can do this type of thing with lots of different resources. Further down the line you can make a weapon making facility that makes handguns or other types. So as you can tell, there is a lot of variation to what you can do.

As you can tell, there is an endless amount of things you can do. So far, I HAVE done the full tutorial on the Switch just so I could figure out controls, and then I started sandbox mode on the switch before realizing I wanted to play Tropico 6 on a more powerful platform. On the computer in 6 hours, I have ONLY played sandbox mode on 1 large map, in the same saved game. I'm about to start another sandbox mode on a ""Huge"" map this time. I have been starting out with 150 inhabitants, starting at the colonial age, with unlimited money. The reason I do this, is I can mass produce, and really see my island ""Explode"" quickly. I will start the story line soon, but I just wanted to get to the point, have fun quickly, and not have to worry about funds. If you choose to not have unlimited money, do NOT overbuild, do not build too quickly, take it slow, pay close attention to the needs of everything around you, and  make sure you spend wisely, because it will run out quickly.

As far as issues go with game-play, I haven't had any game-play issues. No lag. No trouble running this on max settings, and it was super easy to pickup the game-play without doing the tutorial. Buy it, try it, and conquer! For the record, you start in the Colonial Age, and build your way up to the Modern Age. So yes, you have everything from huts and shacks, to nuclear facilities as you progress, and of course, much much more. If I had to guess, without counting, probably about 100 different building types. 

I have not downloaded the expansions yet. I wanted to get as much out of the base game as possible, then I can buy the expansions, so I can not review those as of right now. I do almost wish the ""Huge"" and ""Large"" maps were bigger than they already are. As I stated, my computer can handle this with ease, so I was hoping that I could have more open space to build on. That is probably my only complaint now that I think about it. Hopefully they will release larger islands. 

Good luck on creating the Militia, Religious, Broker, Industrial, Environmental, or Dictatorship colony that you have always dreamed of. I recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in other Tropico games (I played the 1st many many many years ago, and that was the last I played in the series), Age of Mythology, Age of Empires, Boom Beach, or anything similar to those games.

After some time, you will solve all missions and it will just become very easy to progress trough time and make money.
I feel like the developers did think about this, and they made multiplayer where you can compete with other players who will make money faster and destroy the other player (win the game). But this is where the experience is not good.
For long time the multiplayer didn't even have a save option, and after adding the save, we still can not use autosave.
If your internet breaks, you will loose all the progress of the game, and unless you saved manually you will not be able to continue. There is no reconnect button. 
It is extremely hard to find other players. There is no global chat or simplified way to view somebodies profile and add them on steam (if they are playing from steam).

It just doesn't seem much improved over Tropico 5, in my opinion. In fact, it feels like somewhat of a less in-depth game than other Tropicos.

But for me it was terribly disappointing, because it is simply neither the game I expected from the images and feature lists (a light-hearted game about being a dictator) nor a fun game about ruling an island. It's a grueling game that, even on ""easy"", requires you to follow specifically an industrial development track focussed on the bottom line at all times, with aesthetics or role-playing both resulting in quick trips to bankruptcy.

You can read the forum for all the pointers to ""the right way"" to develop your country, and the many players who quickly realize that unless you find grueling failure fun, this is not the game for them.

The UI is also really bad for the kind of sim it actually is. The tools for overviews of the economy, politics, etc. are vague and general, and when you select a single person or building you get very little useful visual information about its linkages - buildings highlight their employees, but people don't highlight their home or workplace. The camera zoom levels are coarse - you can see a pretty close-up of things or pick from a couple of zoom levels, or see the entire map.

The entire economy changes instantaneously when you cross an era boundary, so an insanely profitable economy will likely go bankrupt within a year without immediate changes. But unless you've played before you will have no idea how; there is no preview of what will change, no advice from your sometimes-helpful lackey about how badly you will fare. 

It also suffers terribly from giving bad implicit information. Your starting layout on a new map is generally poorly designed and needs immediate fixing. The tutorials leave out crucial information and focus each on one or two specific mechanics.",1606859484,1606859484,False,66,1,0.737091362476348877,0,True,False,False

This is a bigger problem than it may sound like. Other than that it's pretty nice but doesn't seem to add much (altough I've only played 2 eras so far) and it's a bit unfortunate that dynasty has been removed even though it wasn't always very well implemented. Overall, I'd say this is better than 5 and provides new missions, but it's not a huge difference.

Edit: The economy tab is really bad, it doesn't separate one-time costs like construction from running costs making it really annoying to find out how your economy is actually doing. There also isn't a good way to see how far your workers need to travel to work. This is really basic stuff that would be in any other city building game.

Edit 2: As I keep playing I see more and more small but annoying problems that wouldn't be there if the devs and publishers had cared about making a good game rather than just cash in on an established franchise.",1606295230,1606480902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After a long period of not playing the game, I recently picked it up again. It seems like most of these issues are fixed, along with other stuff that really bogged me (missing ability to save in MP for example). Devs care about their game, and as originally announced, I will change this review to recommended now.

There are still issues that are quite unnecessary, but small enough to not spoil the party. It is, however, a little disappointing to see that some of those have been in the game since beta, and they still haven't fixed them, like people standing on incoming steam boats in T-pose or without any textures. Still, the game is absolutely playable, even in MP, so here you have it: I officially recommend T6 now. It's a good entry to the series, not as in-depth or challenging as T4 and it has its flaws and missing content here and there, but generally speaking, you can have lots of fun with this product.

Oh and I want to share a few words on the new DLC. It surprised me that they took so long this time because Tropico is well known for getting mini-DLC every couple of months that would only contain a new building, a new map, and a new mission, and those DLC vastly outnumbered actual expansions. T6 seems to go with some sort of a middle ground solution. The first DLC took more than half a year, and it contains multiple buildings, a new map and a new mission, but also some new gameplay mechanics, voice lines etc. I would still prefer it if they saved up new content for a big addon, but I am okay with this. I think Llama of Wall Street is a little overpriced for what it delivers, but discounted, I think you can give it a go.

In summary: T6 is a good game - finally. Still needs more fixing and content, but I don't have a reason anymore to not recommend it. While I would still recommend waiting for a sale, it is a decent game you can sink hours and hours into without getting bored.",1605900204,1605900204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a pre-teen when the first installment came out, playing on my Dad's iMac all those years ago. Every revisit to the series has been fueled by a deep nostalgia and desire to recapture that true, utter fascination the game presented me as a kid. I honestly feel this game's influence in so many interests that developed out of that period in my life, from the thousands of hours I've spent over the past 20 years playing simulation and strategy games to my appreciation for Latin music. Heck, I'm not sure if this game was something that initially piqued my interest because of my passion for history, or if my passion for history, and even eventual degree in that field, was somehow rooted and fostered in those hours and hours spent with this game in adolescence. 

This time around, with Tropico 6, a series of burning questions have been scraping at the back of my mind. I get that this game is supposed to be fun, goofy, tongue-in-cheek, whatever. But where are the indigenous people? In this utterly depraved world that colonialism and imperialism have created, do we participate in this amnesia? Do we deny any acknowledgment of the millions of people who were exterminated or enslaved to create the premise for this game? Do we mock those individuals throughout history who, time and time again, have sought to defend their culture and livelihood from the nightmare that is settler-capitalism? Why, when looking to other games in this series, is the only actual mention of indigenous peoples a Tourism building from two previous games, in which the building description reads only ""nobody on Tropico knows exactly what happened to the indigenous people of the island?"" Why, upon further investigation, does one realize that Kalypso Media is also behind Railway Empire, a game that features this same glaring peculiarity? Is this an accident? An honest mistake? Why is it okay with me that this German company that makes video games for European and American audiences allowed to to get away with such blatant western chauvinism? I guess the answer to that last question is that it isn't. I cannot play this game without confronting these contradictions, and I certainly cannot recommend it to anyone based on this realization. 

I don't believe that the subject matter of this game is too taboo or untouchable or anything like that. I think that the people who created this game and this series have really missed a great opportunity to not only celebrate the rich history of indigenous struggle and self-determination, but also an opportunity to create a game that is deeply intellectually and emotionally satisfying in its exploration of the complex historical relationship that is found in imperialism and revolution.

Look, I don't want to convince anyone of anything. I don't want to shame anyone. I don't want to ruin anyone's good time. I really just wanted to goof off with this silly series of games I've been following for nearly twenty years, but with any ounce of reflection, I am left with this real gross feeling as I click away on my island that unfortunately, doesn't just go away when I issue edicts for free housing or higher quality food.",1605661295,1605661724,False,3,2,0.492138087749481201,0,True,False,False

But actually T6 feels quite the opposite. Especially in later stages it really plays like a economy simulation with far more depth than its predecessors. It is harder to make money. The days when it didn't matter what you do you will always end with profit (Tropico 4) or some basic thoughts are enough (T5) are gone and a well driven economy in the government type of your choice needs proper investigation and management to your island - at least on higher difficulties. Factions are harder to handle as well. 
Still it hasn't lost its cynical humor.

Gameplay wise T6 took the best out of T4 and T5. Theres a lot to build and do. Shaping the island to fit your style is really fun and rewarding. But then again there is nothing really new in Tropico 6. 
People with a small budged might just stay with the older ones and won't miss too much. If you are new to the series this might be the best way to start.

There are some issues with building bridges combined with random generated maps when the islands might be too far to connect and no information appears as a downside of the newer features.

Bugs are existent but mainly within the scenarios when they are really annoying like non working pirate bays. But since I barely play them they don't affect my rating for the game very much. I'm more of the sandbox guy.

The old political system in which factions had a coherent set of goals in line with their ideology based on satisfying economic and social needs now revolves around meeting random demands to build or do things you don't need, with relations penalties for declining these nonsense objectives.

Citizens frequently make stupid decisions about where they live, work and meet their needs, happily driving across the country (or spending months waiting at bus stops) instead of using the services in their community. Mitigating this leads to every island devolving into the same few tired optimisation problems, leaving little room for experimentation or visual variety if you want your treasury to stay out of the red.

Avatar customisation is minimal and has almost no effect on gameplay, so the days of setting up your leader for a particular strategy and theming your island around it are gone.

The previously vast array of decorative items is now replaced with a dozen or so park blocks of various sizes, none of which are particularly interesting to look at.

The game is more stable in that you don't lose tons of workers in factories and other places.

Finally, mines don't wear out so fast and one nice feature is that you have warehouses to stockpile goods for trading.  Also, it's easier to keep power plants running.

Adding insult to injury, the game does not present numerous statistics within its menus that would be helpful in determining where you fall short, which leads to wild, eccentric swings in income. The game lacks numerous dials that would enable more successful playthroughs. For example, buildings have absolutely vast amounts of input materials storage. Far more than they could ever reasonably go through in any kind of short-term. There is no way to adjust this. As such, raw materials that you could otherwise sell for some kind of money instead sit useless piling for eternity. This, and many things contribute to a snowball effect of unforeseen errors that doom your island. 

Please note, even the official Steam guide for the game states that there is not a set formula for teamsters to production. So even the guide concedes to the apparently random and shoddily designed systems. I understand Tropico has always gone for a certain kind of laid-back 'feel' in its gameplay, however the developers here have extremely miscalculated. The game must work at its core in the first place.

For Gameplay: 

1. Add more wonder options

2. Please consider improving the graphics. Reflections of light and particles don't react natural and trees dont blow with wind... There are no weather effects, or seasonal effects that can affect your city management. 

3. Consider more options for generally everything. It gets repetitive.

First the story. Previous Tropico games, 4 and 5 in particular had campaigns. It was series of missions which created a narrative, with a sense of progression. Usually it started gentle and pushed the difficulty slider as you went to propose more challenge, sometimes being quite harsh. In one case, your had multiple islands where your progression was saved, and could decide which one to use for which mission. Again, it was good. You pretty much built on what you already made your home, your economy was already there, you could plan for the future. Here? A grand total of 15 missions which are absolutely not linked in any way, and each is a flashback. They often are limited to one or 2 time periods, and nothing of what you do in any of them is saved for an other one. It's a big step backward.

Due to the lack of progression and conserved assets in this game, a lot of good ideas from the previous games disappeared. Exit the dynasty system which was fun as you could have your president's family run businesses or become ministers and offer bonuses, as well as groom them using your swiss bank account. Here, the swiss bank account is pretty much a black market. You do tasks to get some swiss money, and you use it to purchase some things on said black market. Problem is, your swiss bank account is independant in each game, so once you finish a mission, it's completely wiped out, forcing you to start from scratch again. Sure, it creates a balance for each mission, but the disappearance of this system also removes one of the main goals from Tropico which was pretty much to bleed your country dry for your personal profit, and the profit of your family. Finding ways to vampirise the treasury while keeping it afloat and prosperous was a nice challenge which I enjoyed. Now it's gone.

So, you have less content overall, you may think the new systems would make the game better though? You would be wrong. First, they tried to expand on the already bad political system from 5. In 4, it was simple, you make people happy, they vote for you. Normal. 5 made the politcal parties, which were the real entities you had to court, as even if someone was super happy, if their party hated your guts, they would vote against you. As party assignation was completely arbitrary by default, it required social engineering to manage to keep things going, and created an added level of complexity which was not needed and not fun either. 6 went further by keeping the same system and making each party or country/block bombard you with tasks to accomplish to get favor with them, most of them sidetracking you in doing stuff which is a pain. You can refuse, but refusing penalise you. And because you will run a lot of those at the same time, they will progressively fill the bottom left of your screen with a bunch of reminders. It has to be noted the public order is also a lot more volatile now due the creations of a stupid concept of carribean happiness which raises over time, and compare itself to your overall happiness, lowering public order as both number get too close, and forcing you to send raid missions to sabotage it constantly to keep it in check. Yes it kinda makes sense on a realistic standpoint. No, it's not fun to incorporate in a game as it's one more chore to do for the player so their games aren't ruined.
The archipelago system which was hyped to hell and back during developing is in fact a massive logistic pain because the game doesn't give you proper tools to deal with it. You see, tropicans can travel via road, or via metro on the same island. To travel to an other island, either they use road and bridges with cars and busses, or they will use little rowboats which are super slow, pretty much takings months to go from point A to point B. If you can't establish a bus network, or have car parks everywhere and bridges, people won't travel fast and use those idiotic rowboats, pretty much not working enough and tanking your economy. If the game had made a ferry system to allow tropicans to commute between islands using the sea, it would have been great. But this doesn't exist, as such commuting between islands is a logistical nightmare. You come to wish any map will be one big island, or multiple big ones close by, as multiple small islands are pretty much the absolute worst. Not only that but goods must also transit, and doing so also takes ages, as instead of a logical system of local teamsters carrying local goods to a port, then ships carrying all that to the main port, teamsters instead take boats to go to where they are needed without taking into consideration which island it is, do their task, then come back. It's incredibly inefficient, and turns archipelagoes into even more of a pain as moving things around is long and tedious. Of course, the mappers love to put complementaries resources on multiples islands so you have to bring one to an other island so it can be mixed with an other to make an intermediary product which then has to be carried on an other island and mixed with an other into a final product. Oh boy, the archipelago system is so great!

Let's talk about roads. Roads were notoriously bad in previous tropico games, and angling them properly to make them go the way you wanted and not take the most silly curves was a pain. Somehow 6 made the roads worse. You can't lay a road that is less than 3 squares long. The point or origin and end of said roads are the only ones able to connect to other roads. To explains why that's terrible, imagine trying to make a T junction. You lay your first straight road, then you want to make an other which will cut it into the middle to connect it. Well, screw you, you can't. Because the middle of the first road isn't a connecting point, it won't work. Roads angle stupidly still too. Bridges block connections too. If you build a security post on a road, it also count as an obstruction and will conflict with connections. If you try to relay the road and the post is still there, it will prevent you from laying any road, and you will have to destroy and rebuild it, which cost money. Alternative being to relocate the post two times. The game hate you making angled road, which is the most efficient way to lay roads as space is premium and you absolutely need to cram as much stuff as possible in a small space for efficiency, and buildings are always square or rectangular. As such roads will try to take as much room as possible and waste as much space as possible. It's terrible, I don't know why anyone would make that and call it good, and why so long after release no one has fixed it yet.
A corollary of that is that the mini-roads connecting a building to main road is very sensitive to any change. If you build a park near a building's entry, it can very well somehow change the terrain to make the game consider the building no longer connected to a road.

So at the end of the day you're left with new systems which would seem good on paper, but just make the game worse, and with overall bad tools to build in what is pretty much a city builder. Like a lot of city builders, the game falls into the commuting pitfall where the game turns into managing traffic instead of building a nice city. It's not as bad as in say, City Skylines, but it's still quite bad. In theory you would make it so you build some zones with everything your citizens need around their workplaces. In practice, space is limited an so is money, so it's not possible until it's not really an issue anymore or you lost because of it. Because you start missions with islands which often have bad layouts and worse economy for their era, the problem is increased. When you are in modern times era and you don't even have the basic researches of colonial era, it's infuriating.",1600889513,1601058854,False,178,5,0.874208569526672363,0,True,False,False

My thoughts are that this is an adorable little game and I've still got lots more to discover.  I've always loved Tropico and I think the developers have done a good job on this one.   The only thing I find annoying is the fact that you can't build on certain 'uneven' terrain so when you put buildings down sometimes I can't connect them with roads even though it looks 'buildable'.   Other than that the narrative is quite amusing and I enjoy doing tasks for my contractors.  The contractors keep you in focus so it never appears as though you've run out of things to do.  Game over is usually down to  overspending and a negative balance so if you feel like you're getting nowhere consider reading up and starting over.

Naturally, when I discovered there is a new Tropico game, I was hyped. And it's my pleasure to say that I'm not disappointed.

You'll come across many negative reviews (although the rating is generally positive). I get it, this game kinda feels like a mashup of preceding installments with a little completely new features added to the mix. Many also don't like the way the new developer is handling Tropico. I get all that, this game sure as hell isn't perfect. I just can't concentrate myself on the flaws, because playing Tropico 6 is great fun. Keeps me occupied, can be challenging at times, so far I think it's less exploitable than for example Tropico 4 (but I may be mistaken) and it even takes some features from 5 that I didn't like at all and somehow manages to present them well enough for me to be entertained.

Overall, I'm very happy I made this purchase. I also bought content DLCs but haven't tested them yet, so I may edit this review in the future.",1599565449,1599565449,True,7,0,0.600828409194946289,0,True,False,False
492720,75492912,76561198026210741,256,8,120,0,120,1599313326,"This is the first game (out of hundreds) I ever refunded.

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the previous games in the series, I was already on the fence about it because of other reviews and gameplay videos. However, with the 50% sale I decided to have a go at it. However I was almost instantly hit with the sensation of this being a optimized/unfinished game. 

The first thing I did was go into the customization menu, and was shocked at the character-model that was standing in front of me: An ugly model that was clipping with itself at several points while not even being animated. The shock about the graphics continued when seeing the models ingame. I generally don't care about graphics as long as they aren't an annoyance. But in this game they seem like they were placeholders that still had to be updated but never were. Even Tropico 1 has animations that are more fluid then this. ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kt5ipuDFMI]Legit, just go check a video or play that yourself.[/url])

I continued playing though, as this is a game where the gameplay matters! Within minutes I was hit with repetitive text lines and ""build X"" missions that asked for the same (completely unnecessary) building in a row. While the voice acting was good and the dialogs felt Tropico-ish, there was such a disconnect between them. Like they were never really finished all the way: after saving Penultimo, he instantly goes on like he always has been, like he has been at your side for ever and that is basically the whole story of the first mission. 
There are instantly noticeable improvements too like being able to actually get a top view, but, there are to many obvious shortcuts taken to truly enjoy t this game for me.

[b]Addition after playing the game a few more hours on a mates PC: [/b]
The music in this game is more subdued than in the previous ones, the average BPM (Beats per minute) is slower and the volume of it seems normalized and lowered. (I had  music and master set to 100% with the rest around 50-70%.) This makes the music truly background music, you can perfectly watch a stream on a second screen with it going for instance. But this isn't a good thing; The music in the previous games was more on the foreground and grabbed your attention in a good way, it suited the theme/feeling of the game greatly. 

That fact, accompanied with the fact that a lot of tasks are just ""plop X down and wait for Y"" makes this game grab my attention a lot less. Even after hundreds of hours, when I start a mission or a sandbox in 4 or 5 it grabs and holds my attention until the game is over or I suddenly realize the time. Tropico 6 doesn't do that and I find myself losing attention (while waiting) a lot more.

Speaking of the tasks you get, this game seems to reward ""the humane president"" a lot more than ""the harsh dictator"" and pushes you way more into bending over to everyone. Even though I play mostly play as a good president in the previous games, it feels a lot less like your will is absolute law (even though you make the laws). In the previous games factions had requests, in this one they have demands and telling them to F off has a lot more consequences. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but because the way it is implemented makes like you are just doing chores for factions, instead of being that almighty dictator.

Tasks/demands also seem poorly tested and implemented:
-You can just turn (unwanted) edicts off right after enabling them because of a demand. (This wasnt the case in previous games).
-They love to make demands for the same building over and over (even if you keep them), the military loves having 12 roller-coasters....
-The Dual demand sometimes requests the exact same building for both parties, yet you still have to choose.
-Non of the tasks are challenging, they just ask to plop X down, or wait for Y to be produced: No time limit to put any stress on it.
-The urgent demands that cause ""terrible""events to happen (forgot the ingame name) are very trivial at best.

Furthermore the few games i played, were always the same. The economy becomes sooo predictable after a few games.. And some aspects are simply ducked up, you can have an overall hapiness of 70 but 30% of support. Dunno, something wrong in those figures.

Currently the game costs 20$ which honestly is still too expensive to me.

The economic page only shows your income PER MONTH. Once you realized that your income had drop below the zero, that will be few month later when the boat come again. The only chance to deal with this problem is prepare tons of cash and then try to find a way to increase the income before the game end, which will always be failed in normal difficulty.
I don't know what make the in-game economy so hard, but I do believe this is the hardest normal difficulty I ever play in the Tropico series.

I tried to give everyone in the island a job, but the fact is that the  economy will never be better when everybody have a job. It seems like somebody absent his/her job and I still have to paying them, so the best choice is never pay or never give them a job.

Beside, I found that happiness system in Tropico 6 become more difficult, too. Is this  been designed to stay around 50%? Every time I try to break 50%, there always be an economy problem follow behind. And last time I try to increase the happiness of housing, I build lots of empty apartment but people are still homeless. I have build two bus line and a parking deck for them, so that may not be a traffic problem.

Tropico 6 is a good city managing sim because it's goals are simple: keep your approval above fifty percent, and make a profit regularly. This plate spinning is easy enough to understand, you exploit your islands resources and fulfill the demands of your citizens and your political factions. What makes it so addictive is that there are lot of different kinds of resources to exploit, and your factions and your people constantly want different things, so each play-through is varied enough, and the basic objectives are simple enough to understand.

What can get frustrating though is that the game will not explain certain statistics to you, which can doom you and you won't know why. Your popularity will steadily decrease and you won't know why even though you keep building what your populace wants, or your treasury will constantly be in the negative and you won't know why even if you slash everyone's salaries to save money or max out everyone's salaries to motivate people. There is an almanac, but it doesn't explain enough; it will tell you your biggest expense is paying the teamsters to transport goods, but lowering their salary or demolishing a few teamster's offices will not change anything.

I also want to point out a flaw that I've had with the series overall. Tropico is suppose to be a banana republic dictator simulator, but since you are not personally experiencing the perks of being a heartless dictator there is no reason to be one. You can rule with an iron fist, have military and surveillance everywhere, but all that gets you is tons of rebels that you have to constantly put down.

I'm basing my experience on the mission campaigns. Tropico 6 has a tutorial, missions and a sandbox. It's weird, I was going to complete all the missions and then try the sandbox in the belief I would know everything about running an island, but after I finally completed all the missions my enthusiasm for the game dried up completely. That probably would not have happened if the missions were shorter and acted more like an extended tutorial. Instead most of that 200 hours were on trying to complete all those damn things, I almost quit playing altogether several times because they were so frustrating, but they also hit the addictive part of my brain. They could be awful though, the missions would go on for hours then near the end you would find out you didn't do something so you're all out of money and all your work would be for nothing.

I think I am done with this game. It was fun, but I am exhausted. This is a good game for anyone who wants to build a kingdom that actually has a personality, but does not want to deal with a lot of graphs and micro-managing.",1599184436,1599184436,True,27,2,0.776042163372039795,0,True,False,False

Tutorial is great in presenting small concepts in stepped concert, exposing the player to more concepts and then building on them in the next episode.  My only ""druther"" (I'd rather) is that I would appreciate the next tutorial mission giving a reminder ""hey, you just learned X, don't forget it in this scenario, you may find it useful"" and then giving the player the option to utilize it.  However, I suspect that's handled more-so in the campaign.

Tropico does a pretty good job of avoiding the ""hard early, easy late"" trap common to builder games by having the agents you must placate - citizens and foreign powers - become more numerous and more demanding as the game progresses. There's also a lot of content allowing you to develop your island in many different ways. Even with populous islands, I'm not coming close to building everything. 

The game has a nice whimsical sense of humor. To give an example, in the ""Llama of Wall Street"" scenario, the ""Broker"", a shady character who does illegal deals with you, is kidnapped by the Americans and tortured until he gives them a plan to defeat the Eastern Bloc. After you save some resources for the plan, the Broker is released to you barely alive and disabled. Once released, he develops a plan to get revenge by destroying the US with bugged computer chips, which of course you get to implement. Whimsy! Well, OK, it doesn't sounds like such a whimsical plot described that way, but it is, trust me ;-)

There are some fundamental, I mean really fundamental flaws here. As an example, housing. Citizens who aren't ""well-off"", which isn't well defined, can't live in houses. That simple. You can't reduce the rent to allow them to live there. It's just really stupid and shouldn't have been included. The game feels cluttered compared to it's predecessors, and there are some small things which have been changed and only for the worse. There's very little to like here over the previous games. El Presidente is less customisable in material ways (there is more junk customisation into terms of hats or whatever). Things which you want to be able to see easily feel like they are harder to find, the almanac for example is worse. The crowning achievement of utter stupidity here it that somehow, you can ""heist"" various global iconic buildings to provide a bonus. Brandenburg Gate can be on Tropico. It's just silly honestly. The graphics aren't really much of an improvement. It just feels like the overall product design is just badly thought out. Stick to any of the previous ones you already have. Or, if you haven't played the others, play Tropico 4 or 5 instead. The previous Tropico's had a very sensible and reasonably complex game beneath a veneer of tongue in cheek humour.

Graphics are okay, mood is good, jokes are entertaining, music is great. I honestly wish I could recommend this game, but the gameplay itself is just horribly unbalanced with regards to the economy and era progression. Suddenly your perfectly tweaked economy falls like dominoes and turns into a bottomless money sink that is beyond saving unless you saved up millions to cushion the transition and somehow figure out the magical formula that completely reshapes your island's infrastructure. Add to that the foreign superpowers that are more like annoying little brats that can't take no for an answer, and the factions that are somehow even worse. While the country is in irredeemable debt, at war with rebels that bomb the most crucial buildings, your army literally just sitting on its ass doing nothing because most of the soldiers are in their homes and not at the barracks, the factions will throw a tantrum and totally cripple the country simply because you refused to build that theatre they asked for. The rebels for that matter, oh boy, they are just a lazy game mechanic: stupidly annoying, frustrating and totally unrealistic without actually bringing any fun or a deeper level of gameplay to the table. I know it sounds like I can't handle the pressure, but, honestly, I never had a moment where I found the rebels actually useful, fun, or valuable to the gameplay in any way. They are clearly just there to lengthen the game and give it that Tropico feel from the previous games.

Having in mind all what is said above, I would not recommend buying this game. The only point for Tropico 6 to exist is so that mac users can play the 64 bit version.",1598052178,1598052178,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This series is my favorite city building franchise and Tropico 6 does not disappoint. Many small improvements make this fun and addictive to play. Between balancing the economy, happiness, and different political and foreign factions. There are many new and different things to consider when building your city.

In reference to Tropico 6, I like how they added the bridge and tunnel system, although small changes, it really puts a fun spin on building your island empire. The graphics are beautiful and the mechanics are solid. I ran into maybe two very minor bugs, so it also ran very well for me. One of the few downsides for me is probably the campaign. Although the missions are challenging and still have that same Tropico charm. I still miss the days where you built on past towns in past eras and progressed through a campaign and through towns you had already built.  

Again a very solid entry for the Tropico series. The only caveat for me is the price as of August 2020. $50 is a bit steep for any city builder game in my opinion. But if you catch it on sale for $30, it's well worth that price and probably worth the $50 price tag as well.

1. when you check on you approval rating - its doesn't tell you what the people want. Or it does but i couldn't find it.
2. This game is about elections, but what if i wanna be a dictator, nope that's not allowed. There must always  be an election.
3. the maps make it quite difficult to have good fertility with the plantations and ranches, and the trade, wow
4. you get little to no profit with trade. It all depends on the teamsters and modifiers, and all this other shit. 
5. You must always do what the quests say, you can decline and lose more approval even though its against the capitalist, or communists, or environmentalists.
6. The houses are just stupid, only a certain wealth can live here, but all they do is live in shacks, you cant even move them or indicate that there are houses for them.
7. The teamster and construction workers, you can't select them and ask them to collect a certain thing, all you can do i watch them work or walk or drive from one section of the map to another section in 4 months. what?

Its a good game but i think the developers went from one extreme with Tropico 5 to another with Tropico 6 - like night and day

They re-balanced it since it's release, so it isn't as easy as it was to have a runaway economy that carries you through all objectives. With the decay now forcing you to mix up your economy and stop just producing boats and rum for the entire game. Scratches that itch for a good management sim that has been missing in the market since around the time of all the good Tycoon games. With a clear objective and ways to accomplish it, this game really shines. Tourism can really break your game if you focus it though. Was heading over 10 mil when I finally decided to finish the Tropicoland mission. The roads can be fidgety, but when you figure out how to work them, they work well enough.

The bugs can be frustrating though. That's really the only problem. But it's a big one that can ruin an entire playthough and waste hours of good progress. The only big one I've run into was where my teamsters forgot that a uranium mine existed, and never picked up the ore, all while my reactor sat without ore, because the second mine I had kept ejecting it's workers no matter how many times I hired foreign ones, and no matter how many jobs where available. Farther away mines where getting workers, this one was relatively close to city center. Even when it did produce uranium, it went straight to my dock. This shut down my economy, because my main industry was cars. Without power they failed to produce enough to cover expenses. I failed in a matter of a few months, but not because of my economy. The people without power in their homes, due to a 600+mW shortage ousted me. 

Smaller bugs are plentiful though, with a recent one being that I locked the broker offers, than he wouldn't allow me to reset it without a reload of the save. Built up a good 10k in broker funds before I figured it out. Another recent one was that America refused to register that I sent them any trade goods. I checked and was sending out about 1000 units of rum per month, but America never registered that, or the cigars I was sending them. The other trade partners where fine. And for some reason, even though every worker is present at a barracks or an army base, they will allow rebels to set fire to your buildings, and will usually not kill them unless you have multiple of each military building. I recommend that you just buy 2 or 3 the aircraft carriers, and research the alternate work mode that makes them not do collateral damage. That being said, those bugs don't happen every game, and the only game breaking one I ran into was the uranium problem.

I do recommend this game though, as I've already put in 100 hours and plan to finish all the missions and do a couple sandboxes.",1596676439,1596676439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am referring to the military aspect, or lack there of. I understand that Tropico has never focused on military but I think it would greatly benefit from paying more attention to military. After all, you cannot be a dictator without control of the military. 

The major issue thew game currently has is when there are Guerrilla attacks the watch towers do absolutely nothing, even with the most recent DLC/update. I spend a vast majority of my time just putting out fires. I wish we had the option to advise which barracks would respond and assuming they are fully staffed, be ready to respond right away. Watch towers should engage enemies, they currently do nothing. 

I do think the game would also be improved by having a faction leader of the military (general) that you need to win over. Getting the military on your side should be an important part of a dictatorship. 

I like the idea of guerrillas but I think there should also be times when your people attempt to overthrow you if you become to unpopular.

Enter the free weekend earlier this month.  I saw the banner pop up and without kidding myself thought, “well shoot I’ll give it a free go, but let’s be real, I’m probably going to end up buying it.”  I’m only human after all... a human that loves city building games.

To start off, the game is GREAT for easing you into the learning curve.  The first scenarios are essentially tutorials and I was amazed that I was picking up on the concepts and menu navigation fairly quickly.  The scenarios themselves are what’s driving my gameplay.  Where in Cities: Skylines I’m yet to try any of the scenarios out, Tropico’s scenarios offer unique storytelling and propel you through new mechanics and challenges.

The game’s visuals are pretty good.  I love zooming into little parts of my archipelago to see what my busy little workers are doing, or to get a nice screenshot of the docks with a flowing waterfall in the foreground, but for a game in 2019 they are somewhat basic.  You won’t find the Anno 1800 level of detail in this title.

The music, however, is top notch.  I often find myself bobbing my head while carrying out my duties.  Just listen to El Malo, El Feo, El Otro on the soundtrack a few times and you’ll be yelling “Qiiiuuuennn?!” along with the song.

There’s a few items I’m a little weary about.  Efficiency of plantations, factories, etc seems to be an arbitrary number to the player.  You don’t have the precise “this is how long it takes to output this” that Anno does (at least not that I’ve found so far) which leads to a lot of trial and error.  Also a few things aren’t detailed in the menus, like specifically what the area-of-effect circles do for certain buildings, and what it will cost when selecting certain diplomatic or regime options.

Overall the game has been compelling enough to look over the minor rough spots.  I’m happy that Tropico 6 was my introduction to the series cause I do love the bridges and tunnels which apparently are new to the series in this game, and the scenarios have been entertaining and increasingly challenging so far.  I look forward to working my way through more of the scenarios and battling the obstacles they throw at me.

Tropico 6 has made my list for current favorite city building / management games with Cities: Skylines, Surviving Mars, and Anno 1800.  I heartily recommend it for anyone into the supply chain management type builders who also might enjoy a bit of politics and a dash of whimsey.

8/10 El Presidentes would stuff the ballot boxes again.

It does take a minute to get used to the new mechanics and menus, it can be a difficult game at times too. There are a few glitches once in a while, where you have to restart the mission to fix it.

Best of all - I absolutely LOVE that they have included the classic El Camino as the vehicle of choice for Tropicans.  Awesome.  So clever.  Love it.

*Buildings of Tropico 5 DLCs are all in one in Tropico 6. 
*Less Traffic due to Bus services and Metro system unlike Tropico 4 and 5 where traffic is a nightmare and main road needed 
  two parallel roads but in Tropico 6 only one road need.
*Different Foreign powers in each era, and I love it <3 
*Some characters in Tropico 4 are back like Moreno also Sunny, and Rodriguez though some characters from Tropico 4 and  5 did not come back, though new characters in 6 were also likeable.
*Raw Minerals especially Oil and Aluminum has more resources than Tropico 4 and 5 unlike my previous games those 
 resources easily diminished and need heavy imports, but Tropico 6 makes me less depended on importing raw materials.
*Rebel Uprisings were rare unlike both Tropico 4 and 5 that needs many army to crush them. 

Things I hate: 
*It's hard to raise an economy than Tropico 4 and 5, especially in the Missions, even in Easy mode. And despite has 
 complete industry including tourism, I was easily game over.
*Some people did not move in to the residence when the work place was near to the new residence that I built. Since, I build aside the main city along the small towns design for tourism and other one design for agriculture. 
*The Salary part at first was confusing but it's not the same of adjusting the salary level of Tropico 4 nor Tropico 5 paying 
 simple level, since the Tropico 6 combined the elements of Tropico 4 and 5 level. 
*The rent part is more confusing it's more on budget though don't know how to specified in order to adjust the paying rent, so that less homeless. 
*Slowing food to produce like Sugar, Tobacco and Shellfish. 
*I miss the Natural Gas part since less pollution than Crude Oil/Petroleum.

I have played Tropico series from the beginning. Tropico is a unique game--it's the only game that like a realistic dictator simulator. It is great fun, ruling a virtual country the way you see fit, just like a president. Well, maybe this game helps you to become a real president in the future? Who knows!

 Let's talk exclusively about Tropico 6. In this franchise, there are multiple islands that you can connect them with harbours or bridges. It's all up to you. Or if you want to connect them with Telefèric stations, you can too! There are advantages and disadvantages of choosing one of them (don't pick all three because it won't be efficient) that you'll learn as you play the game.

The main profits are still exporting stuff or tourism. But as you progress, you should upgrade your profit-building fast! In Tropico 5, it's still okay if you want to please your people first, but in Tropico 6 hard mode, you should fix your economy quickly or you'll lose the game. I feel this franchise is more challenging than the others. I like it! After all, in real life, a banana country won't last long.

Now we're talking politics! Politics in Tropico 6 is way more complex than in the other franchises. You cannot be extreme in a faction, because there are still people who will oppose you. It's realistic to me because even if you want to create a communist utopia, there'll still people who have a capitalistic way of thinking. When you want to create an atheist heaven, there are still people who have faith in God, just like in real life. So, you have to please them or there'll be unique consequences if you have a bad reputation in one of the factions. For example, if you have a bad reputation with the capitalist, there'll be a monetary crisis which will increase all the cost of your buildings and decreases the price of all your exports. It's that challenging. Then again, you can be an endless dictator if you have good armies in your side. Just sign the martial law edict and try to live with it.

Tropico 6 is a really great game that I think people who like ruling games should buy this game. You won't be disappointed.",1581616156,1594994657,True,6,0,0.561004757881164551,0,True,False,False

Having said that, I wouldn't recommend paying the full RRP for it (I bought it in the sale) - I don't think it's a keeper.  Although it's nice to play a grown-up, complex game with multiple facets, I also found it pretty tough to play (I played on ""normal"").

- Balancing income with keeping the citizens happy is very very difficult.  People get unhappy very quickly, despite having millions of identical clinics, taverns etc. all over the place, and it's hard to resolve this.  The average Caribbean happiness index meanwhile shoots sky high, making the population discontented with your rule.  However, bringing in enough money to build and maintain more services while meeting the mission objectives is very tricky.  This results in periods of sitting waiting for export ships to come in to get some cash, which is then all instantly spent on a new building.
- A lot of the side missions which come up are irrelevant to the main objective, and sometimes will not help you with the main mission at all.  Even if they're not actively detracting from your mission, the time and resources you put into them distract you from meeting the main mission, with the ACH increasing all the time and making balancing everything rapidly harder.
- Sometimes loads of side missions and main objectives get triggered all at once, which results in an overwhelming surge of too much on.  This is interspersed with periods where you sit waiting for things to happen in the background.
- There's no ongoing campaign or storyline, just a series of completely separate missions, which I found quite surprising.  It seems like the kind of game which would normally have an ongoing story.

-Vehicles disappearing in thin air or appearing out of thin air.
-Bridges being too low and having no possibility to adjust their size; Ships clip right through them! This throws me so much off, that I want to avoid building bridges.
-Ships clip through each other.
-Citizens walk themselves into the Asylum instead of getting arrested and transported there.
-When you issue a nuclear testing edict, the weather only gets hazy, no mushroom cloud in the distance, no flash... earlier titles of the franchise did this better.
-The building process is not pretty, first a crane erects a framework and later on the building suddenly appears out of thin air. Also when it does, the framework clips throughthe building model.
 No one expects a more detailed building system like in Workers & Ressources Soviet Republic, but yet it could've been prettier with multiple visible building stages and no clipping.
-There are road signs over bridge entrances giving directions. But since you can't name the individual islands, they all look the same and call out the same directions.
A waste of potential. This is a case where it would've been better to not attempt to make road signs, if they had no intention to lead the idea to the logical end.
-In the Intro you can see things like high street bridges (equivalent with maybe grand bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge), yet you don't get to build these. Would've helped
with ""Ship vs Bridge"" Clipping Issues.
-No day/night cycle, this game switches just skips the night. Another wasted opportunity to actually improve the game, I missed this already in earlier titles.
-El Presidente just casually strolls over the island and visits buildings, even when his approval is low as hell and rebel presence is high and that without an armed
escort?
-You can't build metro stations to connect different islands, they only work on the same island... Eh Limbic, tunnels below waters, these got invented, didn't you know that?
-Workshop support but only for custom islands? Come on, again wasted potential?
-The Coloring, compared to earliers titles, is not that vibrant, that tropically rejuvenarating, not so full of life, not so bright.
-There are no radio short debates, where Penultimo is basically kissing your backside and Sunny is criticizing your government in a satirical way.


Overall, the game feels rushed in development, as if it still would be in an Alpha Stage. If the advertisement would be honest, they should decrease the price by 50% permanently and attach an ""Early Access"" in front of it to reflect the current game state, as long until all these flaws are fixed! 

So far I sadly can't recommend the game and I honestly don't understand, why so many people give it a positive review regarding these flaws.
Reading these positive reviews, consisting of one-liners like ""The game is fun"" and stuff like that... I honestly believe these reviews got either bought by either Limbic or Kalypso or the Tropico Franchise has an incredibly non-demanding fan base.
And this game is out for like nearly a year, this is somewhat unbelievable...

I hope that Limbic fixes all these flaws so it can be called a proper game with proper improvement in comparison to earlier titles and if Kalypso rushed them (happens, when Publishers are too greedy)... well Kalypso, if that is what happened, you can be glad that Tropico is just a game and I'm not a real, mad, caribbean dictator...",1594625735,1594625764,False,3,0,0.529506564140319824,0,True,False,False

I've played every Tropico game that has been released, from the best (1 and 4) to the meh (3) to the terrible (2 and 5). I would say that 6 falls unambiguously into the meh bucket. 

My biggest complaint about the game is the mechanic for citizens becoming rebels -- when liberty happiness is low, citizens start becoming rebels, sometimes BY THE HUNDREDS. It doesn't matter if your citizens are happy with every other aspect of their lives, it doesn't matter if 95% of the population votes for your re-election every election; low liberty happiness leads to hundreds of your citizens, many of whom otherwise love you and vote for you, converting into rebels. 

Because of this mechanic, many of the options available to you in the game are useless. For starters, propaganda. If you build a radio tower or a TV station and start broadcasting propaganda, your liberty happiness will start to drop and eventually you'll have so many rebels on your hands that either they'll overrun the palace, or you'll bankrupt yourself defending against them, and/or you'll slowly kill off your population by constantly hunting down your citizens as they become rebels and attack you. Similarly, because of the mechanic that low liberty happiness --> rebels, you can't realistically use the martial law edict, and you can't realistically set the constitution to allow total surveillance of your citizens. What's the fun of being an evil dictator when the game punishes you for trying to behave like an evil dictator?

In earlier Tropico installments you could choose the path of being a militant totalitarian warlord, or a freedom-loving capitalist president, or an eco-fascist, or a hardline marxist dictator, or a democratic socialist, etc. etc., and there were pros and cons to the different approaches. This game takes that choice away from you in two major ways:[list]
[*]As stated above, you can't make any choices that harm liberty happiness, or else you'll eventually lose the game
[*]Also, if any faction on the island is sufficiently upset with you, they'll hit you with a negative event that will often cause you to lose the game; therefore you're forced to keep all the factions happy so this doesn't happen; therefore you can't cozy up with some factions and screw over other factions like you could in previous Tropico titles[/list]

In sum, I really dislike how Tropico 6 railroads you into maximizing liberty and trying to keep all the factions happy.

A final note: this game is DIFFICULT. Remember how easy the missions were in Tropico 3 & 4? That's certainly not a problem with Tropico 6: fewer than half of players who own the game have beaten the first mission, fewer than a quarter have beaten the second mission, and **only 1.6%** have the achievement for beating all the missions. Of course, a lot of that drop-off could also be explained by the game being, in the words of Kalypso CEO Simon Hellwig, ""good, but not very good"". 

tl;dr: The game is okay; better than Tropico 2 and 5, but worse than Tropico 1 and 4. It's about on par with Tropico 3. If you're a fan of the series, maybe buy it if you can get it 50% off. If you're new to the series, I'd pass.",1590023212,1594600451,False,30,0,0.751140892505645752,1,True,False,False

Pros: 
pretty graphics and building design, wayyyy better than tropico 5 and on par with 4.
ability to move palace and other permanent buildings is good
citizen's schedule affecting production is huge as well and adds challenge

Cons,
Combat is a step down from 5, you have absolutely no control over your army. You cannot set retreats or tell your army to wait until back up arrives to begin attacking the rebels. The result is rebels will just clump together in one spot while your army just marches into their doom one at a time. I should be able to actually issue commands such as just defending the palace.  I've lost so many games to a miniscule rebel threat simply because of this

Logistics logistics logistics. This is the hardest tropico game economically. I like that because I feel like I'm actually running a country. However, this game has little to no way to manage logistics effectively. It would b nice to be able to designate plantations as strictly for processing agriculture in factories while allow other plantations for food consumption only. The most we get is the ability to designate a farm as local consumption allowed. I'm sorry but this is not enough. Also you have no control over your teamsters ( the dudes who transport items all around your island). They seem to just decide which goods to get at random. The result being is that sometimes crucial parts of your economy (oil, ships, uranium) will not go to the desired location fast enough, this can tank your economy at times because your teamsters are busy moving corn around the island instead of, ya know, the uranium thats literally powering my entire island. I need the ability to give orders on logistical priority. For example, I care more about pineapples reaching the cannery and becoming a valuable item to sell than a tropican not havin pineapples in his grocery store. The only way to remidy this issue is to spam teamster offices.

Because it is so robust, I recommend doing the tutorials first. There isn't a help in the game and so you are on your own with figuring it out. But if you play the tutorials, you have a head start.

Pros:
+ Good soundtrack
+ The ability to move around islands
+ Customizable palace
+ Addictive game play

Cons:
- strong learning curve
- tutorial is lacking key elements
- limited ways to succeed
- lacking in variety of buildings and people
- Its extremely hard to improve the happiness of your island while maintaining your budget and materials
- It lacks so much content that Tropico 3-5 had

Overall, I give the game a 2/5. It needs so much more to make the game run smoothly. The palace customization looks like it was a side thought; and the decorations make the palace look odd (it needs foliage to make the palace look decent). The happiness aspect of the game is where it really gets complicated; people get very unhappy due to things like housing, religion, liberty, job happiness, and etc. In the other Tropico games, it was easier to raise the happiness of the island before an election, now its harder to make people happy while maintaining you island. Everything needs to be balanced for everything to work properly. Once you get to the Cold War, everything gets harder.

I had a chance to test out the game during beta, and while it has come a long way since the initial Beta release, I still find myself unable to recommend this game in it's current state. With additional patches or content, I would be willing to try it again. I also recognize that the studio designing this game is new to the series so I understand there is a lack of continuity with this edition, and that if they are a new studio there are things missing that could be a result of a lack of experience. I think it was a good idea to delay release, but I'm still not interested in playing the game in it's current state.

This is a summary after a few hours of the full release, but many more hours playing in Beta. I also have had the chance to play for about another 20 hours or so and still have a hard time recommending this game.

The issues I have are as follows:

Glitches - As per the most recent update, pirate missions don't seem to do anything at all? Also when I close down the game it keeps running I have to go into my task manager to close it down every single time.

No Campaign mode - Tropico 5 had great campaigns, several of them in fact. I liked that it would jump between two different maps during a campaign, and that the city would carry over to the next map exactly as it was built. There are Missions in this game, but no ongoing campaign, and since each Mission appears to be locked to a particular era as well as a map, the city you make doesn't appear to carry over between campaign missions.

Difficulty - It is easier than it was at first to advance past the colonial age, but ultimately, as soon as you do your economy will tank completely. Every single game I have played since advancing past the colonial age I have failed because I run out of money. I need to build infrastructure to keep your citizens happy so they will vote for me, but service jobs make no money so I end up making people slightly happier by a few percentage points and drowning in debt. I need to build industries to get out of debt, but I can't build buildings to do so because I have no money. All the industries that you build in the colonial era are worthless once you advance past that so you have to essentially demolish it all and start over again. You will also hardly get any trade route for products that you actually produce, and watch out because for no reason whatsoever the game will spring a financial crisis on you that tanks your economy even more. Also people will move into buildings as far away from their work as possible, so you end up with someone who lives on one island but works on another and since they changed the mechanics so that your citizens only work while they are at work, your production will be nil. I dunno when my workday starts I have to be there on time when the day starts, not whenever I feel like it. Because of the way the mechanics work, the amount of time it takes for your tropicans to get to work is included in their work day so they never work a full work day most of them spend most of their shift time just getting to work in the first place.

Pirates will attack you almost immediately and destroy buildings before you even get any defenses up. 

Multiplayer - There are no multiplayer save games, which pretty much makes Multiplayer unplayable. It forces one to create games that are doable in one sitting, and doesn't encourage players to build sprawling cities because the games don't last long enough. There are also only 9 multiplayer maps, no option for random ones, and only two 2-player maps. 

Graphics - My system is not that old but I could run Tropico 5 on max settings and it looks great. This game I can run now on Ultra settings and everything still looks choppy even with the anti-aliasing on. Also the building designs are pretty lackluster, and look very generic and uninspired. There are woefully few variations of certain buildings, like Taverns and parks. There needs to be at least double the amount of available park layouts, some with more green space as most of them are concrete. Still no 1x3 park? Also the 2x2 parks don't fit well together so they are often misaligned.

Gameplay - The trade screen is difficult to navigate, imports and exports should be on different screens. There is still no way to pave areas where you don't want parks but also don't want shacks popping up all over the place. Intersections can still only be built as perfect right angles, no ability to make more unique roads, like having a traffic circle or intersections at odd angles. 

I really enjoyed the Dynasty mechanic in the last game, shame it was left out. Also no capability to name El Presidente? More buildings need to be able to rotate or change layouts. Being able to have plantations or grocery stores with different layouts would be ideal. At least being able to mirror their layout would be helpful. I would like to be able to have a grocery store entrance to the left instead of to the right. 

Since I have been having difficulty getting out of the Colonial Era, I haven't been able to try many of the mechanics so certain things like espionage and the business man I haven't tried much at all.

What I did like:

Music - As always the music is great in Tropico. It fits the game very well, although I wouldn't mind more tracks, as there are only a handful of them.

New buildings - There are a ton of new buildings, and a few classics that are revamped. The Mono and Multi-culture settings on the plantations is great, encourages you to build lots of different types of farms together. Leather and coconuts are great early game resources to invest in to fill some jobs. The way the mines work in this game is much better than Tropico 5, as it allows more flexibility, and the opportunity to reclaim land after the mine is empty. 

Moving between different islands on the same map is neat, either by boat or bridge. But oftentimes boats will just get stuck in the water and stay there forever so you are paying people to do literally nothing. I have to demolish the building they work at and rebuild it so that they return to work.

Interface settings are nice, being able to set the scale to whatever works for me. The overlays and the almanac are very helpful.

They brought back pre-election speeches that can have a huge impact on your approval ratings as well as the ability to make a minor ""campaign promise"". The technology tree makes more sense compared to Tropico 5 IMO. There are some edicts you have to research prior to using them which forces you to be a little more strategic, a plus to me. Previous Tropico games really lacked something for you to DO, other than build and watch the cash fly in. You can now send out or conduct various ""operations"" that can have differing effects such as new blueprints, bonus money, immigrants, even acquiring special monuments (Statue of liberty, etc.). These are done through spending operation points that are slowly generated during the game. The swiss bank account concept has been totally re-made as well which adds a more lucrative side to the game. You can use swiss funds for various actions. Tropico 5, swiss bank accounts became pointless once you maxed out your dynasty, a feature no longer in Tropico 6. One of the BIG changes IMO that really is a downer, is the soil degradation. You essentially have to either relocate plantations over time, or run a less efficient workmode in order to avoid this.

I enjoy the different elements that you have to juggle in order to keep your economy afloat. From increasing efficiency, reducing pollution, providing entertainment, appeasing the factions... It's all about managing a country's economy from the point of view of El Presidente. 

As far as actual city building goes, the relaxed nature of building placement was refreshing. Placing roads, after some practice, is exceptionally easy and island layout usually makes it easy to construct an organic, aesthetically pleasing city. I haven't done much with age progression, as I'm still in the beginning missions, but it excites me to know that as I progress and grow, I'll have the opportunity to modernize my buildings and industry. 

The animation style is also quite lovely. With my cpu specs, I'm able to zoom in on certain building and see my people bustling around, fulfilling their various roles. Uncovering roles was also a unique aspect that made getting to know the citizens of Tropico even more compelling. The criminals, soldiers, pirates, and commandos was not something I expected to enjoy. 

Industry can get a little complex. My recommendation would be to lay a good base with food production and resource gathering, then moving on to creating the industry buildings to refine it. Trying to rush and put too many refined items into your economy can lead to a boom in trade that you won't be ready for. And warehouses are important to store inventory that you don't have enough space for at your docks. Be sure to incorporate plenty of those around your resource producing buildings.

The good parts:
++ The same great humour as the other games.

The bad parts:
-- The map generator generates plateaus that is unreachable for goods transports.
- The options for raids feel a bit limited even if they realy arent.
- Not a big fan of the fact that i have to buy/steal blueprints for buildings.

General opinions. One thing i have actualy missed from a lot of tropico games are Railways for goods transports since on a larger map the teamsters can create a lot of trafic problems. The tunnels in this are a good adition but since they need to be placed inside a wall this causes problems when you have a plateau without a mountain.

1. Play this game with an island setting for the first time.
2. Send your agent to a foreign country to steal the wonders of the world and monuments to add to your collection.
3. Build bridges, tunnels, and transport such as taxis, buses and cable cars. Tropico 6 offers transportation and new infrastructure.
4. Customize the appearance of your palace as you wish and add some additional visual display from what we have provided.
5. Tropico 6 provides a revised research feature to focus on the political aspects.
6. Tropico 6 provides co-op and competitive multiplayer features that can accommodate up to 4 players at once.
7. Tropico 6 will not continue the story in Tropico 5. This game will provide Campaign Mode in 15 unique and fresh stories.

The cons of this game is that even though Tropico 6 presents multiplayer features, there are still restrictions that are applied. The players must be on the same platform network to play together, namely the console. Xbox Live players can't play with PlayStation Network players or PC players. And vice versa.

I like the political flare - especially on the harder difficulty settings, you need to pay attention to your populace's happiness otherwise face expulsion from office. Once you've played for several in-game decades, you will get to a point where you will be hard pressed to lose an election, but overall balancing the needs of your populace helps the end game from getting stale (at least for me). And unlike my second favorite Tropico game, which ends at the year 2000, there is a long end game. Tropico 6 is, IMO, the most ""city builder""-like of all the Tropicos. You will get to a point where you're basically challenging yourself to expand your population continuously. In your settings you can set it to up to 10,000 people, but I've only ever had about 2200. Balancing jobs, immigration (attracting enough talent to fill positions, but not too much which will increase unemployment and lower happiness), education (you can't just build an endless supply of factories and other advanced economic buildings as they require educated workers. You can set you immigration setting to ""Skilled Workers"" but in the end game this will not give you enough people if you go through a spending spree and build several factories all at once. Alternatively, waiting for your uneducated masses to earn relevant degrees will take some time), services (religion, entertainment, health, safety, liberty, etc), and safety can be a challenge. I have even had moments in the ""end game"", well after I had researched everything and built almost every building, where I almost lost an election because I basically grew too fast. This adds a much more interesting and nuanced city builder compared to something like Cities Skylines which is basically impossible to lose. 

That said, it's not perfect. One of the best features from Tropico 4 was basically the ability to role play as a particular type of dictator. There were literally premade dictators, like Fedel Castro, that you could choose from to start a new island, but you could also create your own. This created some fun situations: maybe you role play as a minister trying to build a holy oasis, maybe you're a cold hearted capitalist trying to keep control of an island teaming with communists, etc. In Tropico 6, you can basically create an island in your vision (you can pass ""edicts"" which will morph your society into what you will - religious, communist, intellectual, industrial, etc. paradise) but you can't change the settings to make most of your populace a certain faction. 

At any rate, I would definitely say it's worth the price of admission. You'll either like it enough to get several dozen hours of entertainment, or love it enough to return to it time and time again like myself.",1593806978,1593806978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of the franchise. Enough of a fan, that I bought the DLC despite the fact that the game was am unplayable bugfest at launch. In hindsight, I even felt a little bad about being so disappointed about the state of the game, that I ended my launch review with the words, ""If the workers in the game reflect the devs' work ethics, the necessary fixes may take two years.""

So here I am, a year and then some later, giving it another try - and what am I expected to do? Close my eyes and pretend, things got better? Stop using entire features in order to be able to play a game, whose design I adore?!?

After fifteen months, the state of Tropico 6 is nothing short of an outrage.

I refuse to go over the lengthy list of features, which are still bugged afdter fifteen months, since evidently nobody cares. But I will not take quietly, that Kalypso has the nerve to add insult to injury. It isn't bad enough, that this city builder is too bugged to reliably handle multiple construction sites. No. In reaction to this deal breaker, Kalypso added an information ""help"" text to the loading screen shuffle, which informs the player of the fact.

A lot of fun is possible once you understand some of the mechanics at play, but sloppy design decisions lead to a steeper learning curve than it ought to have. Further, some design decisions seem counter-intuitive when looking at earlier installments like Tropic 3 or 4.

Example one: the budget moves in a chaotic manner since expenditures and gains do not occur simultaneously. Take a game like Europa Universalis 4, or Civilization 6: in those games, what you see on the budget reflects the net, not just gross transactions. So, in those games, you see the total change listed next to the current amount. Here, that's impossible as far as I can tell... there's just the gross amount, and things get taken out or added to that amount in no real organized fashion. So, I go from -1,800, to +2,100, to -300, all in the space of what is about 10-15 seconds of gameplay in the early game. It would be less drastic if I was on speed 1x, but in the early game there's really no reason to go that slow.

Example two: I might be wrong, but is there really no way to set wages manually? And linked to that: is there no way to adjust housing quality manually? There seems to be no manual control over these things like there was in earlier Tropico games. That's a poor design decision IMO, because this, too, means the economy moves chaotically... I can't adjust wages or housing, so rather than just slightly bump those things up with the slider, I now have to build a whole new building or demolish an existing one to make any sort of change. I could be wrong on this, but really feels like there's no manual control over those things this time around.

Example three: Sandbox mode really isn't sandbox mode. Sandbox, to me, isn't having this level of missions and this level of strategy. Even in sandbox, I am having to decide which world-power I want to side with and do a bunch of missions to make it happen. Again, could be wrong, as it's early on, but I fired up sandbox just to explore and was quite shocked to see I had a timer in the colonial era in which to declare independence. Again, not my definition of 'sandbox', though something that can probably be modded easily.

Overall, it's Tropico. But with better graphics, more need to actually engage in trade and research, and so on. And there's the ability to steal world wonders, as well as a bit more sensible military layer (I see other reviews that complained about the military part, but this actually is the best of the last 2-3 games IMO, as I can build specific buildings to get tanks, watch-towers, etc., all without needing DLC).

Currently, on sale I think it's worth it, but unless I am mistaken, there are a couple of odd design choices that I'm quite surprised by, including no ability to manually set wages or housing quality.",1593783947,1593783947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tropico 4: 

- the intellectuals faction leader is much better (the sultry miss pineapple); the one is 6 is the worst faction leader in the game

- there are a lot more missions

- you can set wages for every building, whereas you can't do that in 6

- presidente has many traits that can change how the game is played and what your focus is; I completely forgot about them after a while in 6 because they don't have the same weight/value

- great characters like miss sasha, miss pineapple, nick richards, ambassador crane, reverend esteban are in this and absent in 6

- the radio function for banter between the faction leaders. This is gone from 6 to my knowledge


Tropico 6:

- the music is miles better than 4's

- road construction. The roads snap much easier and aren't awkward (though what's up with those tunnels?)

- this game is really funny. Penultimo is just as great as ever

- the superpower leaders are funny as well, and each era has a different one

- this game seems much harder than 4, although this might have something to do with the mechanics being different. One of the late game missions, The Referendum, was a real ass clencher

- the raid system, broker, and trading system are all great additions. Trading was in 4 but more cryptic and had less of an impact



All in all, I had a lot of fun with this game. I'd like to see some more content come out for it though.

What I want to see in a Tropico 7:
 
- bring the radio back
- some really scummy, autocratic, dictatorial, satanic-level edicts
- bring back the faction leaders from 4; I'm also curious as to the motivations behind getting rid of the nationalists
- maybe some futuristic innovations like cloud cities, flying cars, blade runner-esque stuff for a future era
- I'd like the option of setting grids to dictate where people live and work; for example: highlighting an area and having the people who live there also work there, instead of having them live on one island and traveling all the way to the other for work. The micromanagement involved with evicting tenants one-by-one isn't worth the time/effort in towns with 1000+ pop.


All in all I had a lot of fun with both of these games and I consider them to be the best city builders I've ever played in terms of originality, humor, and uniqueness

~ weirdly toxic community

Tropico 6 is a solid addition to the series featuring all the things us fans have come to expect; economy management, city building, political manipulation, and swaying in your chair along with the music.

The addition of building bridges/having multiple islands made developing my little paradise more fun, and in some ways, challenging than in the previous games. Choosing where to build what, can make or break you, and I found it really fun to come up with creative solutions to make it all work just right.

My primary gripe with this game is a combo of two issues; Learning curve and Insufficient tutorial
I failed several missions in the campaign, on easy difficulty. That was particularly frustrating because I never had any problems with the previous games.  It took lots of experimenting, failing, and reading online before I figured out my problems were related to limiting exports and lowering Caribbean happiness more effectively. If these mechanics were explained in further detail in the tutorial, I would've had a much better time of it.

To add to this, when I looked up how to complete missions, a lot of the community surrounding this game is weirdly toxic. People asking questions are angry and the people answering questions are belittling; it's weird. Not a strike against this game, just wanted to point it out. Be nicer to each other you pricks.

Once I had gotten the blockers out of my way, I quickly discovered that there aren't very many ways to build a thriving economy. This mostly impacts the early to mid game and ultimately isn't a huge issue for me, because you can still experiment with layouts, do side projects, and late game economic adjustments.

All in all, I would recommend this game to any Tropico fan or Tropico newbie who's interested. Be prepared for set backs, and for searching through salty forums for answers.

It lacks customization through mods which is something that the creators really need to work on introducing, especially since it makes wonderful testing grounds for new ideas and concepts.

The comedic commentary by the various characters has been diminished and the comic rantings of the female radio personality have been replaced by rare comments by Penultimo.

However, it is a wonderful buy for those who are new to the series or who wish to create with a larger population (you can use up to 10,000 citizens in this version and even when you overshoot what you can handle it doesn't crash but rather has periodic lag instead.

- you can delete a road or building and try to place the same road or building in the exact same spot and it will say terrain uneven, so you'll be adjusting a city you've spent hours on, go to recreate a road, and you can't... and you have to destroy everything in your city to recreate a viable path... which isn't like your original that you were just trying to quickly fix... and isn't what you had planned at all... and the autosave is 14 minutes away and honestly damn you people for not fixing this, and
- you still can't auto import needed goods; all manual
- mass transit is still a joke

Without having to google things like how many teamsters offices I need to transport all the goods in my city etc.  Of course I am brand new to the series, so I can't be too critical.  I thought the graphics could be better as well as the simulation but that's probably do to my time spent in other city builders.

Multiplayer works but is currently useless. If you buy it for multiplayer COOP know that you can not save, there is no interaction, no mechanics, nothing. Just 2 people building on different islands in the same world at the cost of saving any progress. There has been some disconnects, which cause you to lose everything in the blink of an eye.

There is a problem I have with this one over the others. The campaign does not feel as connective or as long as the past games. Tropico 5 had a series of missions that built on each other and a main storyline. The missions also took a decent amount of time to complete. I had preordered Tropico 6 with these expectations in my mind of continuing such a great series and believing the developers would have done it justice. The game has some missions and they dont contribute to a main story. At first I was patient, understanding the game was just released and still had some bugs. Now we are much further into this games existence and although they have released some DLC, the game does not have much replay potential which is almost essential for a sandbox game that refuses to have a campaign mode.

Tropico really highlights the political and economic tightrope that high level political leaders face in not only just keeping their jobs, but also getting positive economic and social outcomes.  So much of what we see about leaders are the simple narratives driven by media.  What we don't see are the complex web of (often competing) stakeholders that leaders must keep aligned, or the financial/resource constraints that leaders face when actually executing their mandate.

Tropico 6 isn't a difficult game, and the direct parallels to the real world are generally simplified (it is still a simulation game afterall).  However, it is realistic enough to have real world applicability.  And fun enough for quite a bit of replay value.  Even for players like me who mostly stick to sandbox mode.

EDIT: Ok, 100 hours later and I have got the hang of the economy now. The key thing is to make sure you build industry as soon as possible.

The game feels like a mix between Cities Skylines, Civilization and Banished. It's a City Builder/Micro-Manager game and that's right up my alley. 

At the time of writing this I have 5 hours in the game and I only have two recommendations for improvement. 

1. An inventory list to see what goods I'm producing so that I can see which trade routes I can take, and to see how much of my raw items are being turned into processed goods. 

2. A timeline more like Age of Empires 3 where I have to intentionally trigger an age progression. I feel like  the jump from 1700's colonization times to 1905 is incredibly fast and I want those 200 years back. 

Overall a very fun game with a great cast of characters and a wonderful soundtrack.

Maybe I just suck at dictatorship....But I was real good at it with Tropico 4 and 5: Just ask Penultimo, he'll tell you!
Despite having better looking graphics, the maps feel empty and lifeless. Despite having the benefit of 5 previous games to see the strong and weak points of the Tropico series, they've amplified the week points and missed on some of the better aspects that were making this franchise so unique.
The problem with this 6th (and worst) edition, is that Kalypso went with new devs...and at the interview stage, they sadly forgot to ask them if they knew the Tropico franchise? If they liked it? And most importantly: why? Or was there even an interview or due diligence made?? Because simple answers to these questions would have loudly tip what type of game they would end-up with!
Clearly these devs liked city builders. But the problem is this is pretty much their ONLY contribution to the game: You can now build bridges and tunnels! (like in all other city builders! yawn!) You can now build (i.e.'import') the Eiffel tower or the Pyramids! (like in all other city builders! yawn!) But for the rest, they did clearly show that they had no clue what TROPICO was all about: A chilled, crooked, but real dictator role-playing game! 
City building is almost just an unintended consequence in any good Tropico editions. Ask any dictator and he'll tell you: ""Why would have God created palm trees if it wasn't for offering proper housing to ordinary people? ....Fiiiine....I'll build them some houses, and maybe a restaurant, so these big babies stop complaining all the time!"" THAT's how city-building happens in Tropico! By playing a dictator that 'sometimes' has to re-route some of that money that was so destined for the Swiss bank account in some buildings and infrastructure on the island instead.
And I think this is the part that has been completely missed in this edition of Sim-City 6 (Oh! Xcuse me: Tropico 6!) 
They have also completely misunderstood the humor of the game. This too is just a side-effect of the game: i.e. Laughing a bit (or a lot) about the fact that civil rights, including elections, would be...mmmm...disregarded a tad (hum!). And massive sums ($) would be 'invested' in police, army, ...and Switzerland, despite food and healthcare being a 'tiny' issue on the island at the moment. But instead, the devs made a very childish game, with a dictator always walking like a drunkard, etc., and missed to realize we were taking our role as a dictators...very seriously! Now it doesn't matter how you play. You can go full-force Communist, capitalist, in-between or else: The outcome, and the boring game-play, on any islands will always be the same!
Tropicans: It is time for the REVOLUTION!!!!
1) Don't buy this game! (I promise you you will thank me later if you are just bit of a true Tropico franchise fan);
2) I can't believe it is so hard to make a good Tropico Edition. So please Kalypso: Promise us you will never let these devs touching your Franchise again!
Just consult with your fan base....And start working on new, better, and TRUE Tropico 7: Urgently!

It seems the latest patch removed the option to use steam workshop maps for multiplayer. Why the fuck do you implement mulitplayer if you don't give a fuck to support this part, like at all?!

------------------------------

Let me highlight that as in the case of Tropico 5, I bought this game for multiplayer only, so I can't talk about the single player experience. And just as in the case of Tropico 5, this game is fun to play with friends and laugh at random stuff, but imported all of the major issues from Tropico 5, or let's be honest here, the devs didn't give a shit to fix it.

Moreover, it even added more problems which I never experienced before.

The good:

- Well, it's Tropico and it's still funny.
- Multiplayer desync seems to be gone, although never got too late into the game and never played with more than 2 people.
- Tropico 5 vanilla (meaning that no DLC purchased) was a poor skeleton if a game with barely any content (*cough* hello firaxis/paradox games *cough*). Now, Tropico 6 is definitely more content rich than Tropico 5, but far from perfect.


The bad:

- It's still fucking Tropico. Meaning, that vital information, or otherwise important mechanics is totally hidden from you. Therefore if you are new to the system, probably you will wonder why your economy crashes, why stuff is not working and such. Even basics are not explained, e.g. people travelling between work-home-buildings satisfying their needs, logistics and such. To be honest, I sunk tons of hours in the Tropico series, but I still have only a vague idea how some stuff works. Definitely uncool for a city-sim/managerial game, especially that these things are hidden from you. Like, for instance, you can define that certain production buildings' output are allowed for local consumption (or export only). But how do I know what is the surplus (if there is any) there? Why? I defined a cannery to do export only production, but I see canned food sold in the grocery stores.  Why? I have rum distilleries next to a dock, but for some reason rum is not delivered there, but for another fucking (opposite) side of my island, causing huge lag in my production flow. Why? And many of these annoyances.
- While the game is more feature rich than Tropico 5, colonial era and world wars era is painfully barebone in the sense of buildings and options for revenue generation. Then with Cold War era the whole framework of the game gets bloated as fuck, lots of redundant options or ones without any usage whatsoever. More is not always better, I presume we may get colonial/world war focused DLCs, but now it's meh'.
- Talking about more is not always better, somehow Tropico 6 became a swamp of micromanagement for me. Tropico 5 -for me- was a leisure experience, comfortably playing, managing issues and talking about random stuff with friends. Here, in Tropico 6, you get a bunch of micromanagement, not the fun, but the chore way. Somehow the game got more tedious to a great extent, god knows why, can't pinpoint to a single thing (the shitload of edicts/stuff to research/options are definitely culprit, especially that most of them have barely any use at all).
- There are no new multiplayer maps delivered with patches, not even with DLCs. Yes, community can create maps now and release via Steam Workshop, but for me it always meant that the dear developer is a fucking cheapskate to create maps, it's easier and cheaper to just let the community take care of it. Very uncool. And where the fuck is the multiplayer map random generator? I know, I know, there are lots of maps in the Steam Workshop, guess you are too busy churning out your bullshit priced DLCs.
- Talking of bullshit priced DLCs, Limbic has an amazing history of delivering two types of DLCs. Either an outright cash grab (hello Llama of Wall Street), or releasing vital content which feels like being ripped off from the very core of the game to be sold separately (hello Espionage/Waterborne from Tropico 5!). It's not as bad as Firaxis/Paradox, but definitely outrageous practice.

This game is one of the most enjoyable simulators I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It is an incredible mixture of strategy, skill, and luck that keeps it interesting throughout the entire stimulating experience! Incredible graphics which may turn your NASA computer into sludge, but they're well worth it! If you don't have a computer made of cow meat, then there are lowered settings as well. There are many missions, sandbox preset scenarios and a random generator where you can customize all the way down to how plentiful resources will be on your island. There's also a multiplayer mode that I have yet to check out, but it's there if you like to play with other fellow humans (I still don't understand why anyone would want to, but to each their own). I give this game a 10/10 for every category imaginable. I am also unbiased here as I have no allegiance to Kalypso nor the Tropico series. This game is objectively a masterpiece and deserves the highest of praise.

With all of the praise out of the way, there are a few things I would personally like to see improved upon, although I know I'm just a wee peasant and realize beggars can never be choosers, in case the devs are open to suggestions.
1. Roads - when trying to build roads, they connect in very odd ways and I am unable to build a 1 square long road which gets a bit infuriating as I have to delete the road and do not get my hard-earned money back upon destruction.
2. Citizens need to take jobs up quicker (most of the time) - I would have so many times where it'd take a full year to get my citizens to take open jobs that were unemployed. 
3. Multi-culture farms - I noticed that sometimes my crops, which all were different, would incorrectly count how many surrounding crops I had and would nerf my efficiency significantly. I had 4 at once and only received credit for 2. And yes, my crops were all different.
4. Conflicting missions in the colonial era - I found it strange that I had to arrest one of my revolutionaries as I was trying to establish independence from the crown, but if I denied the mission, I'd find myself in quite the trouble with them and risked going bankrupt from not having enough financial aid. I understand it's challenging, but I don't understand why it has to be in the form of a paradox.
5. Citizens REFUSE to move into the open housing options (sometimes) - my homeless citizens, who made plenty and were of the proper economic class to move into my residential buildings, just wouldn't. I built plenty right near where all of them worked, no matter how spread out. I included their favored and necessary amenities (grocery, tavern, etc) and they still refused to move! They were all employed and the housing quality was astoundingly better than their stupid shacks. 

These are just suggestions to be improved upon. This is still an amazing game and I highly recommend it. Remember that nothing in life is perfect, that includes Tropico 6. But that's no reason to stop improving and making progress as evolution guides us humans to do! 

Stay safe during this pandemic and cover your coughs!

In short, every single map and challenge can be solved by ignoring it initially, building your economy through building boats, getting the Colosseum to keep your population satisfied, building offices and banks, then finally doing the main tasks after you're rolling in dough.

Other issues:
-Some of the main missions are bugged and haven't been fixed at the time of writing this. 
-The influence circles of some building are too small to be useful. 
-There is no real variety in how you play. You have to be a standard, freedom loving, free healthcare giving, tax break throwing Presidente otherwise you will have nothing but revolutions.

They really make no sense and the consequences for enacting any of them far outweigh using them at all. The timeline is absurd. I once watched a fire rage in one of my buildings for 3 years. That was with the firefighters fighting the fire. Making good on promises is pointless. I once was given over 2000 days to fix the housing situation. After building numerous houses and upgrading them the housing approval did not even budge. It took my people nine years to complete a contract to export 125 bales of cotton.

It really does a legitimately good work at depicting a satirically dysfunctional Latin American banana republic, it's quite on spot with Latin American culture and the Spanish language, all of that with pretty solid gameplay mechanics that also fix quite a few of Tropico 4's shortcomings while also being more difficult and requiring more thought than Tropico 5. Presidential speeches are back and welcome, and the technological era system also relieves a lot of early game difficulties by blocking mechanics that were very difficult to fulfill in Tropico 4's early game like schooling or medical attention. I very much recommend it.

Specific things I'd like:
- Bring back Tropico 4's ""build last selected building"" key. It's kinda tedious when you have to build 10 houses at once and you have to go through the whole process of selecting the building again.

Hint: try dressing up El Presidente as your personally most hated politician. Or if you're Latino, dress him up as your own president.

---{Game Time}---
☐ Long enough for a cup of tea
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
One play-through takes about 3-5 hours and you need at least 12 play-throughs to unlock everything.

Tropico 6 is definitely the prettiest Tropico that tried to find balance between the gameplay mechanics of 4 and some new features implemented with 5 (some, like Dynasty didn't make the cut though, and generally the game feels like it's missing plenty of content yet). The pathfinding seems to be working better, which was my main issue with Tropicos before this. 

As always with Tropico, it's definitely a pleasant, vibrant and fun experience though with plenty of awesome puns and plenty of opportunities to role play being a dictator and manage a tropical island. In my book I'll be recommending these games as long as these elements are there.

The main thing that made me lose interest in the game is that during missions, islands come prebuilt.

So, to compare this to Tropico 5 for starters:
Loads of added functionality, the most obvious being that instead of being confined to your island, you are now able to build Tropico on a group of islands. meaning there are now multiple ways of connecting land over bodies of water, including bridges. Tunnels were also added, which make mountains almost a bit ""ignorable"".
The basic gameplay remains the same, with the game starting in the colonial era, progressing through the world wars, the Cold War, and then modern times, with more buildings, edicts, and constitution changes unlocked at each stage.
You can still set the funding of a building at five different levels, which is where my problem with Tropico 5 and 6 begins; as opposed to Tropicos 3 and 4, you are not enabled to set salaries, rents, and prices as an absolute value, but are instead limited to those 5 different funding levels across the board - where in Tropico 4 you could carefully build your neighbourhoods with rent-setting making sure you could control who lives where, or guarantee the best housing for everyone if you were so inclined, here you just build housing for ""poor, well-off, and rich"", with each social strata being limited to their form of housing, with no sufficient opportunity for the player to influence social mobility.
If the function of setting wages and rents as values had been kept, this would be a great game.

Apart from that, the game gets old fairly quickly, and the progression through different eras just leads to deliberately leaving gaps in your city to fill with buildings that are not unlocked yet, the new function of raiding just seems a bit out of place, and there really isn't that much change to Tropico 5, if you look a bit deeper. 
Also, it did seem slightly off to read the Allies in the World Wars era being referenced to as the ""marginally less evil side"".",1586682371,1586682371,False,2,1,0.538949072360992432,0,True,False,False

You play as president of a caribbean island starting from the colonial era up to the modern era.  It is my favorite strategic city builder as it also includes a comedic approach to the real world policy making that real world dictators undertake. You can play as a democratic president or a communist dictator or anything in between.  The building models in the game look beautiful as does the islands.  The campaign missions are generally hilarious and each offer a different challenge that requires unique methods to complete.

The sandbox mode further allows endless gameplay as you can set up games and islands to your own liking and play for as along or little as you'd like.  Multiplayer is further a fun addition that lets you rule islands alongside or against your friends.

The graphics are nice but not overwhelming (admitedly have a weaker computer). I like the new piracy mode where you take world wonders; it adds some interesting bonuses to the game. And some of the economic / use views are more like layout of Tropico 3 (which, in my opinion was the best for its times). But I think that this is a step down in how you interact with el Presidente - in old games you had him go building to building giving boosts and could level him or his heirs up, but in this one he can only do a limited interactions and many of these charge a fee.

Bugs:
- Palace does not always load correctly in multiplayer
- Rebuilding plantations doesn't work correctly, the plowed land doesn't reappear.
- Bus has errors, sometimes it wont come, sometimes it comes and stays there indefinitely.  So your island's economy can literally cripple because no one works while 100+ citizens are waiting at a bus stop...

I've test played campaigns, done a few sandboxes, read reviews and guides, and I get it.  Some choices however are just bizarre, and a lot of what they had in previous games has been lost, for the worse.

Some examples:
- 99% approval rating, with 2 undecided voters.  Good happiness all around.  100 rebels constantly, instantly, and preventably burning my buildings constantly.  Just 'cuz. 
- To service two docks with an economy of around half the available resources, at a 4:2:1 ratio, you need 30 to 50 teamster buildings.  Typically, 20-40% of my expenses are teamsters.  This isn't because they are necessary, but because they are stupid.  The game doesn't prioritise locality of resources and exports.  For example if you have a teamster building on one side of the map and the other, they will travel the entire way across the map to fetch resources, instead of gathering from nearby.
- I had one save with a single island with minerals on, teamster office, dock, etc.  Instead of filling that dock with minerals, they left it empty and moved all the minerals half way across the map to another dock, leaving this one empty.
- Elections are stupidly easily to win, it's not even worth being a dictator in this game any more.  Last ones it was sometimes fun or interesting to try to win elections, but I've never had a game below 70% approval without deliberately refusing to ever build any houses (which took me almost to modern error to get any disapproval).  Note of course that disapproval has nothing to do with rebels, still had plenty of people burning my town down.
- Electricity is too easy now, it's just a thing.  I've never had to worry about it.  The benefits are minimal but it doesn't cost much and maintenance is easy.  In previous games managing power was vaguely tricky and required considered investment.  Now, eh who cares, doesn't make a difference if you do or don't.
- Trade is hugely unbalanced, especially in the main campaign.  A few resources (Rum, Cigars/Tabaco, and Boats) are so brokenly good value it's not even worth doing anything else.  In modern error I'll just make rum with Colonial tech is it makes so much more money than modern goods.
- Fun interactions such as radio and news paper chats have been replaced with rather dull and generic messages, no real ambient ""feel"" for your country other than the bgm.

Honestly, I've been playing this a lot the last few days and whilst I will continue to do so (largely because the music and art is still spot on) it's not worth buying.  Go buy 4 or 5, they're much better games.",1585677900,1585677900,False,4,0,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,False

The lack of shock itself is probably the problem.

I think the housing is bugged, since they always seem to be upset even when I replace their bunkhouses with tenements and bump the middle class up to nice apartment buildings.

As far as the management goes I've noticed that if you expand faster than the demand for a particular good goes it can hurt you, like if you build a factory that requires some food before you have enough extra food and then your people are complaining about food shortages.

One big thing that pisses me off is that I had an island with a lot of a particular resource with a warehouse set to collect/store that, but instead I guess the teamsters were sending it to the teamster port to go across the bay to the main island where the factories were which made it difficult to diversify my economy. The teamsters themselves seem to often be overpaid but underwork, with a lot of raw materials kind of sitting around in the nodes waiting to be collected. I wonder if it's more efficient to just not build bridges or teamster ports between the islands and just make each island a different factory-raw material complex with independent docks to keep all the people on track. But I don't really like that since I like building bridges everywhere, even to the isolated desert island at the end of the chain where I put my nukes and my prisons (it's like an island version of nevada, maybe I should have put my tourist stuff there).

The game itself has always been very simsesque citybuilding, but it feels like they've taken a big step with archipelagos but then refused to take it to the logical conclusion by adding things like other colonies (colonial era) or nations. Giving the military a real purpose by rooting out angry separatists or invading the Dutch colony next door would he been pretty okay. 

The game has always had an extremely linear progression that means replayability is kind of limited- you can go around again and be a dictator, but there's only so many times you can do it. Diplomacy and the like always felt limited, the military feels mostly for show outside the colonial era independence war (honestly the buy independence/fight independence thing feels limited, I wish they'd expand on that and let you do something like getting outside help from the US instead of the local anarchists). Diplomatic options that exist seem to mostly revolve around being nice to the big powers of the era, but I feel the cold war era should give you india and the non-aligned powers as a third option between america and russia. I suppose hypothetically DLC should fix it, but I feel like we shouldn't be hoping for extra paid content to make things right. I would buy it, especially if it had a slightly-deeper layer of options, but so far it doesn't look like T6 will have nearly as much DLC as T5.

Another peeve related to stuff in game is that the system randomizes in weird ways. Like there will be mountain ranges on the edge of the island so it's not economically sensible to build telefericos or tunnels over/through them, or on an archipelago map the resources will be equally spread even though the point is to create situations where some resources are only in one area. Another annoyance is that you can seemingly grow anything anywhere so even if you're in an arid map there's always lots of space for plantations unless it's a really really small map. It is extremely friendly to people who just want to place stuff wherever and not have to set up supply lines to the far side of the island to get their hands on uranium to become a powermad dictator (and that's another thing, the great powers don't seem all that scared of El Presidente's nuclear arsenal) that gets sanctioned by the UN (the UN does not exist in game) for being crazy. In between all of this there's a weird place where if you're winning you're snowballing with ease, but if something goes wrong it feels like you go into a dive that's unable to be correct- there's no median ""struggling but surviving"", it's just 'winning' and 'quitting because you're going to lose'.

Overall it was worth it to buy it on sale, which was my plan from the start (though I missed the Lunar Sale). Played it exactly 3 years after I stopped playing T5, it all worked out  decently. Knew what I was getting into, wasn't really surprised by much, it's Tropico. It's a good game, don't expect to get 1000 hours out of it unless the quarantine lasts another few months.",1585577231,1585577231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a must if you liked the other games and it's really cool seeing how far this franchise has actually came. It has beautiful beaches, trees, ( Don't get me started on the water ) The water is very well done. I even find the city management a lot smoother and easier then in the past. Personally i prefer trying to stay Eco friendly and that is actually a lot easier to do when in the past used to be a nightmare for me to understand. I love the more industry options. That along with the grocery store lets you really take care of your people a lot more which makes them happier which is nice. Its easier to keep people happier which makes people vote for you which is nice. Overall to sum it up the game is great and a lot easier to understand and keep happy. The game is very beautiful and pretty. The only con is it's very easy to mess up and send your country spiraling in debt. I was focusing on keeping the money flowing and was raided and a lot of my buildings was destroyed and next thing you know i lost almost all my money making buildings. I went into 50k plus debt. Yes i understand this con is my own fault. I'm just explaining my problem. I got out of the debt, but soon my income was quickly overcome with expanses and i didn't quite realize. Yes i could have fixed it if i paid more attention to my book, but i remember you got a pop up warning when this would happen in Tropico 4 i believe. Would be nice to have that back so my hours of work on one island isn't wasted cause i get caught up in quest or trying to make money that i lose the island to debt after a raid or event that i fought hard to recover from. overall i give this game 9/10!

Even with reading some of the reviews here I decided to buy it because it was on sale and I'm stuck at home just like most people are at the moment.

I also tried the demo, almost an year ago, so it was not like I was going to be surprised with it too much.

There is hardly anything new in this game that was not in 5 and there is plenty that was in 5 that is not in 6.
This game is less funny, terribly unbalanced economics/politics and became mostly a rinse and repeat approach to the islands. The ui is also less intuitive and you need to customize your president in the settings before starting a game?(who came up with that?) Also, moving the president anywhere costs 1000, what's the logic in that?

Less jokes, less gameplay, better graphics, less story -> much worse that 5. Only buy it if you played all you could play with 5 and the game is more that 50% off.",1585480152,1585480152,False,2,0,0.51185077428817749,0,True,False,False

Here's my 15-hours-in opinion of the game. 

First, I should say that I'm a HUGE fan of the Tropico franchise. My favorite was 4, and 5 was okay as well. 6 does not hold the same magic as the others for me. The Tropico franchise has always been primarily a city builder, with a few management things on the side that made it a bit more challenging and fun. Tropico 4 was the last one I played where city building seemed to be the focus. 5 had a little more of the management elements, but it wasn't overwhelming. 

6 is almost all management, and I can't handle it well. To be fair my complaints are largely based on me needing to ""Git Gud"" at the management elements. It's too much. Even on the easiest setting, even in [i]friggin' sandbox[/i]. I can't wrap my head around what Kalypso wants me to do with the management of the buildings. 

It seems like no matter how many houses, apartments, bunk houses, or anything I build, there's never the right balance of housing. No matter what upgrades or downgrades you make, no one's happy with them. No matter how you set the work modes or how you research new ones, on ranches, plantations, business buildings, whatever. None of them work right. Having one of every building i doesn't work. Having several of any building doesn't work. Trade makes no sense. Building docks doesn't have the same effect it's had in the past several games. El Presidente exists to visit buildings. That's it. 

Just boring, entirely too difficult, unbalanced, and not intuitive compared to previous games in the series. I'll go watch some videos of other people who can win and see what they're doing differently, but I'd rather go play Fallout 76 than feel like an idiot. 

Good job, Kalypso.",1585206611,1585206611,False,67,5,0.705406606197357178,7,True,False,False

There are some glaring omissions in teaching new players how to do things. For example, the very last tutorial where one steals Stonehenge and the pirate ship breaks down and says ""we need planks to fix our ship"" and the tutorial directive says ""provide 1200"" planks but offers nothing to the player to tell them how you do this. If I have to google how to do something for the tutorial mission? Yeah that's a big failure on the part of the dev team.

I also don't like that the control for zooming in and out and rotating a building when you're deciding where to place it are bound to the mouse wheel by default. If I want to zoom in close to get a good look at the spot where I am going to build something I need to make sure I'm zoomed in first otherwise I'll have to cancel the build order, zoom in, then go in to build again.

All that being said? The game is still very fun so far. It's just you need more in-depth tutorials, and the controls need to be refined and made less clunky. Otherwise I'm having great fun for my first time with a Tropico game. :)",1585194416,1585194416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Transport is broken.  Period.  And the devs insist that the things that make it broken are ""gameplay"".  Metro slows down the more stations you have.  Parking garages have capacity limits that make them almost useless, and are so ""ugly"" that no amount of parks can restore beauty to any area with even one garage.  Warehouses are pointless, and there's no point in even building them.  Oh, and busses.  What the actual #@%$!  You can only place two stops for each route, and basically need to spam depots in order to accomplish anything.

The ""Atheist State"" constitution choice seems to only exist in order to punish players that choose it.  It shutters all religious buildings, but the invariably large religious faction still demands them, and all of your citizens still need to visit religious buildings to satisfy their faith need.

Bridges.  The game loves to brag about how there are now multiple islands.  Okay, cool feature.  Then why make the bridges so low that all the boats clip through them?  I know it's a small thing, but it's a perfect example of the development mentality that lead to this disaster of a game.

Don't buy, don't play, not worth the time.  Lowest point in the Tropico franchise since Tropico 2.  (Ironically they used the ""Pirate Cove"" idea from Tropico 2.)",1585179035,1585179035,False,9,0,0.619612276554107666,0,True,False,False

I guess I understand why someone would like this game, but I don't. Maybe I'm just not a good country leader, and maybe I really don't have an understanding of how economy should work, or how to make the people happy enough to not oppose me at the elections. I have no idea why the capitalists are asking me to build prisons, religious are asking for restaurants, and militarists are asking for teamster warehouses. Some factions ask you to do outrageous things like rewrite your constitution just for a little bit of faction standing. Makes no sense. I build my people housing and they stay in their shacks for a year before figuring out that they can move in. The actual intelligence of the teamsters is abysmal. In some cases, I would have one sugar plantation and one distillery, but even if I have a trade agreement to export sugar, they dump *all* of the sugar into the distillery. Makes no sense. Maybe my biggest gripe is how uneasy it is to understand the citizens. My approval rating has gotten down to 6% sometimes and I have no idea why. I have to go to each individual citizen and read their minds in order to figure it out, and even by doing that sometimes it will only raise my voter approval by ~10% (which is nothing). Makes no sense. I build highschools to raise the education rate and people don't go to them to get any education. I build clinics to raise the healthcare happiness and they don't do anything. I build police stations, but it's never enough to raise the crime safety happiness, so I have to build 20 of them in one city cluster in order to put it in the green. Makes. No. Sense. I don't feel like some building work modes, efficiencies, costs, etc. accurately reflect their real-life counterparts, which makes the nonsensical economy balancing continue. I was always paying more in wages than I was getting back in revenue from exports. I was always building another unnecessary structure to appease a faction. The axis always want a trade route, and the allies always want me to sabotage the axis in the commando garrison. One action takes a hell of a lot longer than the other. Nothing you do is ever enough for the people of Tropico.
Makes.
No.
Sense.

But in a way, Tropico is a great reflection of real life. People make no fucking sense, ever. They never know what they want, and when they do know what they want, they make outrageous demands to get it. They're always unaware of what's going on around them, and always stuck in their ways to move out. There are die hards to their beliefs, and there are people just looking to push their agenda. Everyone is a pain in the ass. So I'm leaving the title of Presidente to someone else.

Here goes, I've played only the first two missions. i dont know how the rest of the game is but my first impression with this game is really bad. The game play is fine, no bugs/ glitches, micromanagement is cool. 
The thing that I hate the most is the mission. ( I dont know how to put black line spoiler alert thing, but spoiler alert)


The second mission is about crime safety. At first they wanted me to build a prison, when im done when the first one they asked me to build another 3 at a small island.  Story goes on, the amount of criminals was not even that high the filled up a prison, so yes the game just wasted your fund on the other 2 prisons. 

Around the end It wanted me to build a restaurant around a place with  crime safety below 30. At that point my Island crime safety has reached 70 because I need to fulfilled the promise. Yes I had a rough time decreasing that number but it still  couldnt go below 57, I I even issued penal colony edict and everything to reduce it. Only 2 things that reduced was overall happiness and number of my votes. so I had to build docks because it has high rate of crime around it. Okay, done.
BUT you need to a bank with a low crime safety, another dock and garage built. Okay AND THEN 7 bunkhouses and 3 mansions.  
2 prisons, 4 docks ,3 garages ,and 10 houses were wasted during this game.  

You think that was it. 
BUT you need to make a shady deal with a crime lord who was already in prison( you actually cant do anything to npcs that are in prison) So yes i had to demolish the prison in order to ""make a shady deal"". Okay youre almost there. We need you to find the kingpin and arrest him.

.....

The king pin is already in the first prison that I built( the one that is not on the small island) 
I had to break him out and demolishing prison. Build a prison for him again. Arrest him.

It wasnt hard but it was time-and-money consuming. There might be alternatives or I could restart the game but i dont like wasting my time building it all again.

PS. I jumped straight from tpc 4 to 6.  What i liked in 4 is you usually hear the radio broadcast from Sunny girl and your adviser with his humour every now and then. It makes the game more ""alive"" to me. This one straight up loneliness

You can adjust the difficulty level to your liking (in sandbox mode) to the point you basicly can't loose. The missions on the other side offer enough of a challange to be worthwhile if you want a challange. 
Your playstyle ist mostly free, from a (almost) democtratic leader to a dictatorship - whatever you like.

PRO
- The music is terrific as always!
- Always great to see Penultimo.
- Buildings are smaller scale and not ridiculously huge (I.E the military fort from TP5).
- Better graphics and fun game mechanics.
- More buildings!

CONS
- A couple of my favorite TP5 characters didn't return like Veronica, Evita, Lord Oaksworth, and Lulu.
- Tourism got nerfed(?) Revenue isn't generated well enough from tourism, unless there's a strategy I haven't picked up on.
- Aside from rubber and hides, maybe you could've added carrots, or other type of fruits/vegetables which benefits the juicer industry or another type of industry. 
- The requiring of the blueprints to get buildings. It would've been better researched than bought.
- Demands are plain and boring, and hold no significant storyline like Pnemultimo going to the Asylum in TP5. Little stories and run-ins with a few people. 

Overall, the game is a huge step-up from Tropico 5; with the exception of characters and lack of backstory to the demands, aside the obvious conflict between countries. The Broker idea was pretty swell concept over the family creation, and finding more difficult ways to recieve Swiss income.

I played about 1/3 of the missions to face the same broken aspects of the game just to learn how to play ""hard"" a certain way, the same way, every mission. 

For those of you who are familiar on how they have handled the NPCs over the last few games, they are actual entities again that visit and perform tasks but they are so small, when you zoom out, they are not part of the visual, again to save on resources. 

Other than an improvement visually, some ""modifications"", there really isn't much new added to the base game, yes this game advertises very well ""new"" ideas but they actually come off as a ""DLC"" feel. 

After playing, I just wished I waited till all the DLCs came out and spent the same money but went off the reviews just to be disappointed as a veteran to this game.
