Even the cut scenes - which is the spotlight of many other JRPGs - can put you to sleep. And the opening song, oh my god, whose idea to put that abomination in?

Combat so far is just okay, mixed between action and tactic, excels at nether. 

But hey, at least Rinwell is an eye candy. Gonna try to finish the game so I don't feel robbed from purchasing this disappointment. Update: I actually didn't lol, no motivation to end this snoring grindfest. 

Edit after 30 hours: The plot still sucks, but combat actually picks up the pace and gets quite good. A lot of restrictions are removed or negated to give battles a flow, not awkward moving and swinging like the beginning. The problem is why must it takes 30 hours to get to this point? 
Also the horrible terrible opening song get replaced!

[b]Combat:[/b] once you get used to how things handle, and experiment with what artes combo well into each other, the combat can feel buttery smooth. Just a shame that enemies can take a while to even stagger, and some require certain boost strikes to even be allowed to either get staggered, or just to even land a hit. And sorta-spoiler, bosses CANNOT be staggered at all. Or boss-level enemies either. If you go into this thinking you can combo bosses to death, you will not.

[b]Story:[/b] it's serviceable, but will go off the rails once you reach the last third of the game (and you WILL know when that happens).

[b]Characters:[/b] they're fine, definitely not perfect, and anyone who gets upset at dumb decisions the characters make just wants Mary Sues and Marty Stus that do no wrong and learn their lessons before they ever make mistakes. That said, I do understand if people get frustrated at character archetypes, or a character going so long before a lesson finally clicks for them, but in my personal opinion, the playable cast is perfectly fine. Though I won't say they have any mindblowing dynamics.

[b]Pacing:[/b] The balance between story and gameplay is handled decently well, though I will admit that skits right after most cutscenes feel a bit... invasive. Skits in previous entries felt like a chance to give more insight into how the playable cast thinks or perceives story beats, or even to provide some levity in story lulls. In Arise, however, most skits feel more like extensions or re-explanations of story beats we just went over in a cutscene just before. The few skits that provided character insight or levity, I enjoyed very much, but for the most part, skits in Arise felt like Russian roulette with 5 out of 6 chambers loaded, and I was praying for that 1/6 chance of an enjoyable skit. That said, about the pacing being decent: that applies for the first two-thirds of the game. [b]The pacing takes a horrible nosedive for the last third of the game.[/b] [spoiler]The balance of story and gameplay just skews obnoxiously to story for the last third of the game, and there was barely any actual gameplay to be had in a sea of just cutscenes and skits every few steps as the game scrambles to come to a finish.[/spoiler] That said, however, once the final dungeon is open, the pacing stops being an issue.

All of the party members really grew on me, the main-story is engaging and worthwhile, the side content is great. The game has a lot of small quality of life features which make it fun to play. Also, the battle-system is just top notch! And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack. For me, this game is a straight 10/10!
(english) voices are so well done, it's rare to have such good voices and emotions even in native english games, even more rare in an original japanese game. I really cannot praise it enough, I finished it in a little more than 50 hours while taking my time, not rushing things, just making sure to never be underlevelled, and I had zero problems with the difficulty on normal. No need to turn it down; I feel that the game is strongly balanced around you doing pretty much all the fights it puts in your way _and_ do the side content which is around your level. This way, you don't have to mindlessly grind but gain EXP and SP and materials and ""Gald"" (money) in amounts which are enough to beat everything regarding the story. I never ran short of money, I pretty much always were able to forge the best weapons as soon as they unlocked in a new region... It all came naturally. So if you want to do yourself a favor: play the game's content, don't skip it.

Best jrpg I played for a long time; even if it's shorter than let's say Persona 5 Royal, I personally had even more fun than in P5R and also the characters here in ToA are at least as good, if not even slightly better (especially because of the great voice acting!)",1708726512,1708726512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s a good game and I almost reluctantly recommend it. It slightly reminds me of both Dragon Age and Dragon’s Dogma.
The good part of the game is the first 90% of the narrative. The story is engaging, the characters are endearing, I was enamoured with their interactions, because I am a fan of a budding bumbling awkward romance story. Everything to do with the main 6 characters is great, but unfortunately nobody else, especially the villains, got the same level of quality writing. Villains are especially one note, making it almost impossible to care about them, with one exception who is integral to the plot. The voice acting is great and there’s a lot of it. Story does get pretty contrived in the last 10%, but at least the ending didn’t completely suck, especially considering I had to grind for it.
The combat is fun, flashy, has enough variety for an entire long playthrough. Many options, many combinations, a lot of stuff to unlock and combo together. There is some minor jank, like the occasional strange hitbox and attacks that miss point blank, because if it’s an advancing attack, the character will sidestep the enemy and miss everything. The targeting system exists, but more as a suggestion and to guide your companions, doesn’t actually help you aim single target projectile attacks and if you’re pointing the wrong way with your analog stick or even slightly sideways, the attack will miss. 
My favourite part of combat is the Combo Attacks, of which there are many. Two characters team up and do a very flashy powerful move together. Potentially the best part of the game. The fact that the pretty particle effects linger a few seconds afterwards makes them even better. They’re implemented really well with how the camera moves back to the combat instance.
Another praiseworthy part is how loading in and out of specifically combat is quick and smooth. It really helps the process of fighting for many hours. 
Game does suffer from some narrative dissonance, seeing how some companions, before they join you, are of a much higher level and have more than 30 times the amount of hp they have when they do join you later. To say that they get nerfed is really underselling it.
Now about the bad part of the game. 
The way the amount of hp your enemies have scales is ABSURD. Your damage is nowhere near high enough, it’s unreasonable. The last part of the game consists of hallways, with huge HP sponge enemies blocking entrances. But that itself isn’t the worst problem. By the time you get there, even if you took your time and fought at every opportunity, you will be at least 10 levels behind. But the grind to catch up will be slow, really fokking slow.
The game is terrible at allocating numbers correctly. Be that HP, EXP amounts, number of healing items, money, etc. In the case of healing items, you get almost none and monsters don’t drop them. You either buy them for really high prices or sometimes find in chests, once per playthrough. I hate it. Can’t craft them either. 
CP as a mechanic is terrible, severely limiting the number of times you can heal your party, which impedes progress a lot. Makes levelling a tedious grind and worst of all, drains your resources constantly. 
The AI is not very good at evading high damage/one-shot attacks, so the resource drain is ever-present, so the last part of the game becomes a super annoying tedious slog. Many times my party was entirely dead and I had to kite the boss alone for 15-30 mins. And my damage, even though I had the best gear/abilities always felt SEVERELY lacking.
So even though I recommend it for the story and characters, if you wish to finish it, find out what you’re getting yourself into first.

This game is stable unlike any other games. It just doesn't crash. It works. I saw some games crashing even they are 2D, made with major engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. And I cannot be silent about Diablo IV, MW III, they were nightmares and headaches.
I'm telling that those kinds of games are crashing like Hell, often, not just sometimes.
Actually Diablo IV was better than its released version. It just had to stay as an early access.
It's hard to see normal, standard, sane games these days. So many games are crashing, they don't work with controllers, they've got errors, bugs, faults, and they are too many, and they got paid, they keep selling. Oh, how on earth they get money with those products with so many errors!
Even NVIDIA's RTX 4090 flickers, blinks, especially with G-Sync.
Yes, it's a future we dreamed about yesterday, but is it really better than before? Cutting-edge techs, better looking, but they've got so many bugs, errors, faults than before. And it causes crashes. They cost more, they provide more errors. Is this common sense? Is this sane?
Some people said ""They are blinded, they are crazy about money."" I didn't agree, but now I agree, because I can see this, I saw.
Oh, RTX 4090 flickered again. Gotta turn off that stupid G-Sync again.
Oh, I bought ultimate editions and I haven't played Diablo IV, MW III for long time.

The premise is just interesting enough to keep you pushing forward despite some pretty awful scripting and plot choices. The actors in both dubs do their best with what they are given, though. It feels like the story doesn't get a chance to breathe. From the beginning it's just nonstop action. It's the best Tales Of game for people with ADHD. 

The combat is fun and feels like a modernized Tales game for sure. Previous games probably had deeper mechanics, but it seems that the whole goal for this entry was to capture a more casual audience. I think this combat system does a good enough job of keeping Tales DNA while being easy to pick up for newcomers. The combos are simple and easy to pull off and the presentation is nice and flashy. You have everyone screaming artes in your ears while you all work together to defeat enemies. It's a fun spectacle. 

Exploration took a bigger hit this time around. Areas are quite a bit more linear and focused, which makes sense with what they were going for. Still, fans of the older and larger maps may be disappointed. You kinda go from point A to B with some small nooks and crannies to find along the way. Things do open up a bit more later though. Very standard JRPG map design for the most part. You either tolerate it or you don't. 

To be honest, it has been a long time since I've completed a Tales Of game so they could all be corny as hell. Maybe that's just part of the appeal. There are games out there with offensively bad writing, and this is not really one of them. It's just kinda goofy and half-assed.

Gameplay: easily 50+ hours of just story, probably another 25+ for side content and fully complete

World building: Perfect, you understand the world your in, why its that way, every new location is broken down and built upon
Combat: Aside from the constant shrieking of your companions, the combat is really solid. Not overly complex, lots of different options. You are not stuck playing the main swordsman, free swapping is not required but i encourage it. So many different ways to smash the zugals.

In-depth review:

Story:
A very on-the-nose tale about freedom, liberation, and abusive oppression, each of the five realms represent an idea of control. The game starts off strongly and paces itself well. Except for the latter half, I don't know what prompted to have massive lore dumps in skits and an abrupt nose dive in story telling, but you have to stomach them I guess - the second half is ""fine"". This game has two major story arcs. The first half is better.

Visuals:
The game has gorgeous set pieces and maps, as a Tales fan - most Tales games heavily suffered from uninspired gimmicky UE3/UE4 asset engines. Arise is the GOAT for visually striking art direction. Their usage of the watercolor render engine will last for years to come, every city has a touch of personality and you'll always look up just to see the wonderful skylines each city has to offer. The cities in this game are memorable.

Gameplay (Combat) 
Tales of Arise has very expressive and interactive combat systems. The game has evolved to a point where I can confidently say that Arise has the best iteration of combat compared to the past decade of Tales games.  Granted, some combat elements are diminished from previous titles, but the combat feels complete and well refined that its the case of ""Two steps back, ten steps forward"" type of thing. Every character feels nice to play, and that you can be skill expressive with these characters to show mastery of the game's combat. Combat is not repetitive, and you'll always find new ways to handle a situation depending on your preferred character, gameplay, and style. And after a decade, I finally enjoyed playing a spellcaster in Tales games. Rinwell's gameplay is too damn fun.

Quality of Life/Polish/Etc
These are my opinionated nitpicks that Arise should improve on in order to make the next Tales game astronomically better. This shouldnt be a major factor in the review. Nevertheless, if you like to read nitpicks, please consider these:

[list]
    [*] As with all english localized titles from Bandai Namco, Tales of Arise suffers from a small quality control, there are a significant number (maybe like 5% of dialogue) wherein the subtitles dont match with the audio. It's fine.
    [*] Lack of endgame, I'll be real, other tales games had the incentive to start New Game + runs, this game doesnt have it. On one hand, you can do everything in one playthrough, on the other - its a completely different take from what Tales games are known for, which is replayability.
    [*] Hard is brutally hard, you'll be forced to keep using expensive items just to progress in the story, alongside with some frequent grinding runs in between bosses. The amount of extra hours to pad the game is not worth it in my opinion. Hard makes every boss like Dark Souls, the less-than-stellar AI companions make it worse since you're managing idiots while fighting for your life.
[*] Don't buy the DLCs, do not rationalize BanCo's scummy predatory behavior
[/list]

Conclusion:
Definitely one of the best anime action JRPGs in the market. I will patiently wait for the new Tales mainline game in the future. As Arise is now the bar to beat in action JRPGs.",1677007756,1708467761,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False
740130,158825030,76561198865450964,0,17,1303,1303,1303,1708451609,"Really tried to enjoy this game, but for a story based/driven game...the writing is absolutely atrocious. Having come from Tales of Zesteria, this series has fallen, HARD. Having just cleared the third kingdom (characters level ~25 out of 80), I can't even bring myself to keep playing. Can't give the game much more than a 4/10.

The cut-scenes have tons of awkward, unnaturally long pauses between lines. Cut-scene animations are lacking (for example, protagonists are struggling to fight through enemies to get to a castle but are getting pushed back by an army of enemies...an army of four soldiers holding guns and doing nothing but walking forward un-menacingly) and every character always looks strangely happy even during serious conversations...unless they're absolutely being over-dramatic and bawling their eyes out. The characters also tend to speak in an highly unnatural ""grand"" and ""general"" fashion, as if they're trying to make what they're saying way more meaningful and deep than they actually are.

Absolutely every single plot element feels forced and most of the time it doesn't even make sense. For example, the backstory of Law (the character): [spoiler]neglected by dad who was too busy fighting in the resistance against the evil lord, sneaks into the neighboring country which also has an evil lord, eventually join the resistance in that country fighting against said lord, gets caught and forced to watch all his friends die, beCOmE eVIl anD seRVe tHE lORd wHO jUST KIlLED hiS frIEndS beCAUse lOGic (yes, that's literally it), become good again after basically killing his dad and hearing sob dying speech (that was abso-****ing-lutely cringe), feEL bAD foR seNDINg inNoceNT pEOplE tO guLAG.[/spoiler] This is a glaring example of how the story feels forced - the writers wanted this story arc to happen and just didn't care enough to flesh it out and have it make any sense. There's entire story is riddled with plot holes, cringe moments, and characters being complete brick-heads for the sake of inciting tension/conflict.

Combat is decent at the start, but gets worse as you progress and get more characters. The game keeps on trying to cram down new mechanics that are just bland (new character has special ability that can block&break a charging enemy, new character has special ability to break enemy heavy shield, new character has special ability to cancel all enemy casting art/spell). You can only assign three on-the-ground arts, and three midair arts despite the characters unlocking an absolute multitude of arts. While you're playing them though, there are really only a few arts that are good as the rest don't allow you to chain them together to form combos. A ton of them will just outright miss their targets unless you've got the enemies in a very specific position when you start the art. A really egregious example of this is Rinwell - one of her standard attacks casts a projectile towards an enemy. However, said projectile is always, ALWAYS very far off to the right. By mid-game, there's just an incessant stream of yelling and bright flashy lights absolutely everywhere as characters spam arts.

If you enjoy exploring, this game isn't for you either. Maps are completely revealed at start and are essentially one-dimensional. You follow the path and there will be little loot rooms with additional enemies off to the side every now and then.

This game also has the ""must have crafting and fishing and cooking and farming mechanics syndrome"". Crafting sucks. Basically when you beat one or two enemies in a new area, you can forge a new area-appropriate weapon. Get to a new area, you can buy a new set of armor. Cooking just gives passive bonuses that don't meaningfully affect game-play. Farming is just tossed in as a side-thought so you can have meat for some food recipes.

Quite a bit of effort seems to have been put into the music. Its decent and works well in the background. However, none of the tracks are memorable. I might recognize them if I hear them, but can't recall them if I tried.

Dawn Ultimate Edition is worthless. Didn't play the DLC story (which has mixed reviews), but the rest of the goodies aren't all that great either. Sure there's some skins (which I didn't use save for one or two weapon skins), but not everyone is into wearing bathing suits into battle in the arctic. The DLC weapons will completely break the game for the first two kingdoms as you will be completely overpowered. Hence, I ended up not using them at all. The boosters will similarly cause you to be over-leveled and walk-through enemies without much though (even on hard difficulty). I ended up switching every single booster off, except for +20% SP.

One last thing: no ultra-wide support. You have to download 3rd party software to get to work.",1708454913,1708455064,False,6,0,0.596950650215148926,0,True,False,False

Another big thing Tales of Arise gets right is designing every game mechanic as an essential piece to enjoying the complete experience it has to offer. None of these mechanics seem tedious or boring enough to make the player lose interest. On the contrary, they can be quite enjoyable.

The game introduces us to Alphen and Shionne, two protagonists from different worlds bound by fate. Their quest for liberation from oppression leads players through a profound tale of resilience, friendship, and sacrifice.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Tales of Arise is its visually stunning world. From sprawling landscapes to intricate cityscapes, every corner of Dahna and Rena is meticulously crafted with breathtaking detail. The vibrant colors, fluid animations, and cinematic cutscenes elevate the gaming experience to new heights, immersing players in a world brimming with wonder and beauty.

However, it's not just the aesthetics that make this game shine; it's the gameplay mechanics and combat system that truly set it apart. The fast-paced combat mechanics blend real-time action with strategic depth, offering players a wide array of abilities and combos to master. Each character possesses unique skills and playstyles, allowing for diverse and exhilarating combat encounters throughout the game.

Furthermore, Tales of Arise features a robust progression system that empowers players to customize their characters to suit their preferred playstyles. Whether you prefer to focus on melee combat, magic, or support abilities, the game offers ample opportunities for character growth and development.

Beyond its gameplay and visuals, you will find a compelling narrative that explores themes of oppression, freedom, and the resilience of the human spirit.

Tales of Arise breaks into almost [b]zero[/b] new territory. The plot, linear gameplay, over-exaggerated script. Practically everything within this edition to Tales is a ""been there and done that"" thing. Several times I found myself finishing the character lines or reactions before they did. If you are not in the `Teen` age bracket, you may very well be let-down by this title. If you are only recently venturing into these kind of game, please disregard what I have to say and give the game a shot.

Now, speaking of... speaking (yeah.. a pun), the script is extremely mundane. While the well-lknown (Japanese) voice actors do their jobs well, the writing is mediocre. Was that a very normal clock chime?! 
 Oh my!! Let's scream from the top of our voices: ""What in the world was that?!?!?!"" (not once, but twice!). [spoiler]The main boss, after sparing your life for no reason early game like some many other games do, reveals his greatest motive in the end... he has NONE!.... How exciting.. There is one part when the main villain kidnaps Shionne (again, for  [b]literally[/b] no reason) that pulls on your heart some, but even when you rescue her later, that also has literally no point)  [/spoiler] Tales of Arise follows the likes of Star Ocean and FF7.

Some minor points:

Be ready to listen to the J-Pop boys attempting to sing in English in the OP video over and over and over again. Noticably low in-game draw distance is also something you must be ready to buddy-up with. Otherwise, graphics is one of this game's strong points. Combat is also an 8/10. Lastly, exploration is a mixed bag. Oh, that dragon just felt like sleeping in between the door we need to walk thru... just like so many before. You will fight the same 10 types of monsters with different skins on [spoiler] from world to world. [/spoiler]. Loot is even more random. Hey! I found the strongest armor for Shionne in the game! It called, um ""Wedding Dress""? I don't know. I just found it laying around in that cave over there.

Complaints aside, with all the unorignal-ness the game brings, it brings it pretty well. If you are new to RPGs this can very well be a wonderful experience for you, so take my review with a grain of salt, and make your own judgment.

I personally played Rinwel for pretty much the entire game since her mechanics was pretty interesting to me. Playing a mage who can combine magics to produce higher tier magics was fun to play with. One thing I do want to mention is that you can end up underpowered for the enemies if you ignore the side quests and don't actively seek out new equipment. The game doesn't have to be difficult, but definitely can be if you try to blitz through the story. I noticed a bit late that side quests were the easiest and most fun way to avoiding that. 

The characters were also really enjoyable to play with, especially if you do the side quests. They all have distinct backstories, I especially liked Dohalim's and Shionne's arcs, though I won't go into spoilers. That said, at the end, it gets really heavy on the cutscenes. That may not be for everyone (I was prepared for it, so it didn't bother me much).

What I like:
-Story
-Graphics (The views are so good)
-Satisfying combat mechanics
-10/10 Soundtrack
-Interesting Characters
-A lot of things to do + interesting side quests

Downside:
-After around 30+ hrs of gameplay, there is a certain part of the story where it have so many dialogue and talking, it goes for around 3-5 hrs lol with a lot of dialogue and only minimal combat

ENDING: [spoiler]Why you gotta make Alphen dumb in the ending by not taking the Renas Alma in front of Vholran?💀[/spoiler]. But still, the ending is good. but could have done better :)


Overall, I didn't expect I will get so immersed in the gameplay and the story especially the characters, played and finish this in 1 week.

The main character does not have a personality. Story is corny, but maybe that's what one expects from a by-the-books JRPG.

The combat system is worse than it was in the PS2 and Xbox 360 era Tales games. You cannot set strategies for individual characters. You can set only set strategy that affects the whole party. So you can't set some party members to attack at close range and some to attack at far range. You can only set every team member to attack from close or far range. 

Combat is more about flashy colors and particle effects than substance. Positioning your teammates isn't a thing anymore. You cannot set a battle formation like you could in the old games. During combat there are certain teammate attacks that you can call. When you call these attacks your temmates magically teleport next to you to unleash it.

The dodge mechanic is your main line of defense. Its a dodge mechanic from something like Dark Souls or Bayonetta where there are a ton of i-frames and you get access to a more powerful attack if you pull off the timing perfectly. 

Overall the game just seems to lack strategy when compared to the old Tales games. It seems like they tried to shift the combat system over to a more ""player skill"" based type of design since dodging attacks matters alot and since you have much less control over the positioning and strategy of your teammates. Unfortunately they didn't go all the way in that direction because leveling still matters a lot. If you are under-leveled then your attacks aren't going to do any damage, and it does not matter how good you are at dodging because your AI controlled teammates are eventually going to fail a dodge and get hit and die.

I wish they would have picked a lane. Either have it a pure ""skill-based"" combat system where character and enemies levels do not matter as much, or have it a strategy based system where positioning of your team and individual team member strategies can be set. Instead they picked an mid point between these two philosophies that just dose not work.

The game has DLC to help you get stronger, so maybe these game design decisions were made on purpose in order to increase sales. If character and enemy levels didn't matter as much then I bet it would be more difficult for the consumer to justify a purchase.

TLDR:
-Corny story
-Combat system lacks strategy
-The game seems to be designed around getting consumers to purchase DLC in order to level up their character.",1707150337,1707151705,False,9,0,0.540216803550720215,0,True,False,False

OST is good - although, feels like their volume control was not the greatest, sometimes you just get blasted with epic music when you're just running in the overworld and it doesn't really fit.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Great combat system that is definitely a step above other JRPGs. There are many different skills and abilities for each of the 4 party members that all have superb visual effects and animations. Although the auto target system can be a bit wacky sometimes, I personally wasn't that bothered by it.

The game world as a whole feels vibrant and well-crafted and also very lively with the sheer amount of different NPCs and enemies that you will encounter just by running around the map.

With that said, the biggest flaw of Tales of Arise is hands down the writing. The story was at least a bit decent in part 1, but then it took a nosedive in terms of quality in part 2. Some plot points made no sense at all, and I found myself double-checking sometimes to see if I accidentally skipped over some cut-scenes or not with the amount of random craps that they put into the story. The dialogues between the characters sometimes are just them repeating themselves and totally pointless, yet somehow the focus of the game is very heavily placed on the story. Ironically, the further I progress into the game and the more I read, the less I care about any of these characters.

Still, I did have fun playing this game and exploring every nooks and crannies of the maps (and running through the whole dungeon again just to get to the fucking owl that's 5m above my head). Do give it a try if you are a fan of JPRG.",1706959411,1706960069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In order for Rinwell to cast Sharpness/Concentrate All, the player has to specifically swap to her, losing a good 15 seconds of combat time, allowing all the other characters to take a beating. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why they would do this.. One simple fix to this would be putting S/C All as an option for the strategy selection. I mean, c'mon, all the predecessors have an option to fill this gap, why have you abandoned it so?? ALl the other stuff is able to be overcome by simple skill manipulation.cancelling but this, this is just atrocious.

Beyond that this is probably one of the cleanest and most appealing Tales of games so far. I really loved Tales of Symphonia but this one has held me so far. I originally purchased it a while ago and it got pushed down my list, unfortunately. I am now making a conscious effort to go through my library and complete my games. This is the first one on the list, and so far it has not disappointed. I plan on buying the Pre-Order pack, if nothing else but to be able to leave a review for all the babies who are upset that they paid nothing extra for what I will have to pay $4.99 for. Lol.

Ignore all the haters, I suspect most of them are lying about their play style, time, etc. There is one I can think of that says they beat it in 38 hours but wouldn't play again. On record it says they have 62 hours... Just LOL! If you found this combat too easy, you probably had it on story mode. If you found it too difficult, you probably didn't swap your moves for elements and kept the basic six you earn.

It's a game that I can certainly see the positives and I bet loads of people will really enjoy this game, plus the combat system is a significant improvement over older tales games.

But man is this game slow and filled to the brim with meaningless dialogue, with a story not interesting enough to keep the momentum up, I started off liking most of the characters and enjoying the setting and themes but by the end of it I was just not caring about anything that was happening, this games story gets so dry and uninteresting I struggle to remember what happened. 

Let's talk positives, graphics are gorgeous with fantastic battle effects and great looking characters.

The combat is much better than it ever has been, it's fast and fluid with plenty of options for skills and the use of your party can be key. 

And that about does it for the positives. 

Tales of Berseria was the last tales game I played and I really enjoyed that, it had a story that hooked me in from the get go with a villian that I loved to hate, tales of arise startrs similar but with a less tragic character, Alphen for me personally is way too upbeat and happy go lucky do gooder, his design in the key art invoked similarities to guts from berserk but he ended up being a real let down, sure velvet was very edgy put I prefer my characters to be a bit edgy than just a bit too lame. 
The same could be said for the story, we have two humanoid races but one has enslaved the other, this is a really good hook and I was expecting this to be the most messed up game in the tales series - and while yes it does deal with dark themes it doesn't do enough to make me feel the same hate and distrust that the slaves have over their captors. 

Also this game is just super linear, every section of the world is just corridors broken up and spread about the place, of course this is somewhat the case for most jrpgs but when I was walking through the final dungeons which was just boxed in corridors with monsters slapped about I really started to hate the game.

Look if you like jrpgs that have an abundance of melodrama then you're quids in. If you want a game with a decent battle system then this has it but you will have to wade through the ocean of painful anime stereotypes to get to the good stuff.

Make sure you always buy/find/equip new armor & weapons when you can and do not be afraid of using a couple healing items to tank through hard fights.

I really wanted to like this game. The same developer made my favorite game of all time. However, this particular game is kind of a mess. I think it tried to copy elements of other popular games, and as a result it lost any of its own heart.

Mechanically, it's missing a lot of basic features like a quicksave hotkey and even a menu to let me exit the game. (I'm sure there's an exit button somewhere, but it's not coming up in the normal places where I'd look for it. I have to tab out and then close the game window, and then manually shut down the game on Steam because it's actually still running in the background.) The real-time combat is also VERY poorly designed. I'm sure I could master it with time, but it is not fun or interesting enough to motivate me to grapple with such a complicated system. (This developer has often used turn-based combat in the past, and probably didn't have enough experience designing real-time.) I think they only added real-time combat in order to mimic other popular games. 

Similarly, the game includes a lot of bland mini-games/optional crafting features like fishing and cooking, but in a way that again feels like the developers said, ""Other popular games have these features, so we should add those too.""

I'd have liked a little more depth with this, but considering she's one of six characters I think it's fine.

 Dohalim is one of my favorite characters to play in *any* game, his Artes blending together so perfectly it's hard to see where one attack stops and another starts, with the added benefit of being able to step back and take a breather if you want to cast spells for a minute. Law has amazing combo potential and rewards you for skill by giving a damage boost if you can avoid damage. Kisara is alright but I've never been a turtle, so she doesn't really fit my playstyle. Shionne and Alphen are great too, though I only played them up until I got Rinwell and haven't really touched them since. 

The graphics are gorgeous although there is some pretty bad pop in, there's some mods that are supposed to fix it- I personally don't install mods for a first playthrough of anything though, so I can't tell you if they work. 

The story is pretty standard Tales fare; lots of anime tropes but also some cool original ideas, likeable characters, and I've been consistently looking forward to what comes next. I've not finished the game yet, but my guess is I'm about 75-85% of the way through, though I don't know if there's a ton of endgame, or maybe there's going to be a ton of extra game to come, just right now it seems like I'm nearing the end. I'd say it's about level with Berseria's story with better characters. 

As for the DLC, I bought Ultimate because the Tales games are some of my favorites out there. I mainly just buy it for support. That said, I love all the school costumes (Dohalim looks like a Blue Mage from FF, and I actually like Law's costume better than his default one), the bathing suits are cool for RP in the tropical area though this would be better with a photo mode.

The Warring States all look incredible though I've not used them too much to keep the tone of the story in line (that'll be for a repeat playthough), the New World sets or whatever they're called look great too, Kisara and Dohalim have been using them for 90% of the game, mainly because I hate Dohalim's default costume. Those pants and that neckline, man. Just not for me.

What they either don't tell you or I missed in the description, the costumes actually give you unique titles that will give Artes and buffs, which is nice. Orochi's Wind Gale, Alphen's Warring States title Arte, is one of my favorites for him. 

I rate this game a solid ""buy it if you like Tales games, give an older, cheaper one a shot if you're not sure, and pass if you can't stand anime""",1631894189,1705372235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game went from 9/10 to 6.5/10 in second half but overall still 7/10 after everything sank in. But DEFINITELY -3 points for bad DLC practices.

Engaging Flashy Combat and the simple theme was definitely a hook and first 20~30 hours were alot fun. The playable area are small but extremely well detailed and everything looks beautiful. 
The economy is tough and keeps you poor throughout which forces you to do side quests.
This game has pre recorded Skits and those were alot fun too as they help build charger development in a passive way. Side quests were meh but post game dungeons were better. The animation and Japanese voice was done beautifully with amazing OST and this would have been a must pick up

 untilllllll
you reach so called later part/second half of the game. What most reviews failed to mention was the story took a big hit with the poor execution of the ending and the immersion broke for me. The skits which I praised earlier in first half started to become overwhelming and plainly boring. Even though it's optional you get FOMO for missing out imp stuff but at end every time I played I regreted my time. The sheer amount of skits dialogue animation text boxes it was way too much of a dump rather than competent story telling. It didn't help that the Combat which was the strong suit started to feel reparative and tedious with the same exact enemy re skins and practically the same dungeons having the same path with  different (beautiful) backgrounds made me almost drop the game. Even the some of the characters which were very interesting started to be  annoying in certain areas and I had to skip their part. Final boss is the biggest meh and the execution was WTH. 
Scapegoating the story problem to something beyond is bs and running away from the story imo.

Overall First 20~30 hours highly recommended. Almost Everything which made this game interesting goes downhill in second half Soo my honest opinion is don't be afraid to drop this game  if you ever feel tired and just search up for the story.

The combat much better than predecessor premise, Berseria and Zestiria especially in structuring CC (Chain Capacity) combat system in intuitive way and total elimination of overly complicated armatization like Zestiria and BG {Blast Gauge) system in both of the game. Most of enemies hitboxes I found are actually quite big and permeable area. The comeback mechanic like enemies airborne and character jump and double jump from Vesperia also help with fluidity of the combo.

With the introduction of CP (Cure points) system in battlefield, I think its brilliant move that the game tried to distinguish the heal/ resurrection, astral casting, normal/ charge attack and mystic artes niche into sub-system. Major drawbacks I could observe are for human or demihuman-like bosses which can't be stagger like in predecessor game. Tutorial in early and mid game also seems friendly and cater to new audience into the series.

For the lore part, in my sense is decent and the length is reasonable (took me around 38+ hours on hard mode to finish main game). Camera really ducking out the potential of the scene. Maybe the problem on the skits.

I really enjoyed Berseria and I heard everyone was saying this was even better and then I saw the reviews and got hyped. What a disappointment once I started playing it.

First of all the positives, which are the graphics which are better and the battle system ... at the beginning.

The story is a mess. First you go around 5 different ""domains"" (more like cities tbh) in what feels like a NES game plot. You barely get to know the rulers of these places (except for one). On top of that there is a lot that remains a mystery. Nobody in the party asks Shionne about why she is so hell bent on destroying the lords or why she was on that train. They just go along with it.  However, once you finish with the lords the game gets even worse. The second half is rushed and there are so many plot holes that I stopped caring about the story.

Characters are very one dimensional and you can barely relate to them. Their motivations are barely believable. Law, for instance, after getting his father captured because he did not like him has a sudden change of heart just before his dad is about to be executed (he dies anyway) and now he is a good boy and wants to help the team to destroy the Renans and the rest of the party is like ""yeah, come along buddy even though we were fighting some minutes ago!"". It is so jarring especially when compared to Berseria where you could feel why Velvet was so angry and you really wanted to put an end to the villain who also had a very good reason for the things he was doing.

Gameplay is atrocious, the combat system was fun at the beginning but the enemies are massive sponges on the latter half and the dungeons (the part I hated the most of Berseria) are even worse here. Just corridors with a lot of enemies. Oh and the enemies ... The developers have palette swapped the same 10 enemies during the whole game. It's just so lazy. They even made a palette swap of one of the bosses.

I am just very disappointed with this game. I thought I was in for a very nice JRPG, but this is just generic and boring. Not sure how this won RPG of the year on The Game Awards considering it was against the much better (but still a little bit flawed) Shin Megami Tensei V. If you want to play a good JRPG and have Nintendo Switch play that instead of this piece of garbage.",1705025890,1705025890,False,43,3,0.599410474300384521,0,True,False,False

-visually cool but shallow villains.
-long infodump section with no gameplay (If there was a dungeon or something in-between it would have been fine).
-general strange direction of the plot that kinda undermines the first half.
Nevertheless the main party is fantastic, soundtrack is amazing, graphics are great and the combat system if quite fun although enemy hp is unnecessarily high.
Overall, as a fan of the franchise I was still very pleased with it, to me it's a great step in a new direction of the series. I hope the next game will learn from Arise's mistakes and be more consistent and fleshed out!

[h2]Story[/h2]
[b][i]Arise[/i][/b] is set in a conflict between the twin worlds of Dahna and Rena. They once stood peacefully until the technologically advanced Renans enslaved Dahna’s people and stripped them of their dignity and freedom for the past 300 years. An amnesiac Dahnan man named Alphen is forced to experience the brutal torture of slavery until he meets a Renan maiden named Shionne, a traitor to her kind who causes pain to anyone she touches due to her curse. With their common goals overlapping, the pair reluctantly team up to overthrow the bloodthirsty Renan lords and free all Dahnans from slavery. During their journey, they meet with four amicable companions whilst uncovering the truth behind Rena’s horrific actions.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the story as a whole. At first glance, the story doesn’t hesitate to tackle heavy subjects, such as the horrors of war, slavery and prejudice. However, that’s not to say everything is dark and gloomy. Initially, there was hostility between Alphen and Shionne, which was understandable due to their conflicting races. Despite this, as the story unfolded, they became less antagonistic to one another. Watching their relationship grow from contentious to becoming caring friends is one of my favourite highlights to witness. In addition, there was plenty of cheerful banter that made me laugh and smile because of how charming the characters are. They build meaningful relationships with each other whilst learning to cope with their personal issues and grow to become extraordinary individuals, showing strong character development and effective storytelling.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
[h3]Combat[/h3]
What really shines is the captivating combat. Not only was it consistently enjoyable, but it became increasingly addicting. When you touch an enemy on the field, you are put in a circular real-time arena, allowing you to strike at your enemies with fluid movements using [i]artes[/i]. You control one of four active battle members whilst the other two provide support. Each character has their playstyle and a variety of action-packed moves, which can be upgraded with skill points. For example, Alphen is pretty straightforward as he can hack and slash with his sword, and his perk has a risk-reward mechanic of sacrificing his health for more power. Shionne, on the other hand, casts healing artes and is a gunslinger who has the advantage to shoot down flying enemies. Fighting is exciting because dealing damage is great whereas healing takes time and effort to keep my friends alive. Dodging allows you to perform a lethal counterattack. Spamming the same move can be a habit, and it surprises me that the game penalises you for that because enemies can easily recover, rendering said move ineffective. I find this strategy essential because it encourages me to try out different moves to accumulate interesting combos.

My favourite part is performing special attacks. When foes are stunned or near death, they are vulnerable to a [i]boost strike[/i] where two fighters combine their strength for an instant kill. This finishing move is great because it can sometimes destroy surrounding foes, turning the tide of battle. In addition, you can perform a powerful move called a [i]Mystic Arte[/i], launching you in a jaw-dropping spectacle that will obliterate your foes with destruction! Boss battles are challenging because they can unleash their ultimate abilities that can nearly wipe out my party in one hit. However, that doesn’t stop me from fighting back because they are incredibly rewarding in the end. After the battle, you will earn XP, consumables & various key items.

[h3]Exploration & Side Activities[/h3]
Exploring the vibrant world of Dahna feels immersive. You will be searching various continents, such as the barren wasteland of Calaglia, the snowy mountains of Cyslodia and the fancy streets of Elde Menancia. Among the rich lands are filled with secrets, loot and valuable resources that you can use to cook meals and craft stronger weapons and accessories. You will frequently come across camping sites or inns to rest, restoring HP, but not before being given the option to cook meals and increase bonds with your party members. Cooking grants temporary buffs, such as ATK or DEF boost, an increased rate of finding rare materials and healing a certain amount of HP after the battle. Not to mention the food presented in the game looks appetising. These buffs save you time from grinding. In addition, there are cheap DLC boosts to upgrade your experience. However, I find them unnecessary because it is a waste of money when you have meals to back you up. Tired of exploring? Use fast travel to avoid backtracking. 

There is so much content to enjoy with New Game+ being unlocked after completing the main story. Side quests don’t feel like repetitive chores, even though they are generic with simply collecting materials and fighting enemies. Some can be finished quickly after activating them, and others branch out into short side stories. Outside of combat, you can search for hidden owls for cosmetics, and there is a fishing minigame that can serve as a pastime. The controls are simple, and there are no limits as you can fish as many times as you want. The fish rewarded can be used as ingredients for food or sold for money. My time with fishing was refreshing, as fighting will eventually become tiring after so long.

[h3]Performance[/h3]
Thankfully, I haven’t encountered any bugs or performance issues. I ran the game on high video settings at 1920x1080 with a stable 60 FPS.

[h3]Audiovisuals[/h3]
Built using Unreal Engine 4, the visuals and character models looked stunning. There is photo mode to capture stellar screenshots, but it would be nicer if there were more options like switching between different frames, colours or character expressions. Once again, Ufotable produced gorgeous 2D anime cutscenes, and the soundtrack is phenomenal to the point that I listen to the songs on repeat. 

If I had one thing to complain about, that would be the small but frequent localization issues. I played the game in English and I noticed that in some scenes, the lip-syncing feels off. I also spotted occasional typos in subtitles, as well as unscripted dialogue. Other than that, the game felt very polished, and none of the cons I mentioned above undermined my experience in any way.

I am not okay with the only cheat code in the game being your credit card number. 

I'm okay with the skin and accessory DLC, there's a healthy amount of fun and world appropriate skins in the base game. 
The DLC is a fun addition it's not required. 

My hours played is low because I played the game via a friends account before purchasing it myself.

As far as the game goes: 
It's a linear action rpg with real time combat mechanics where you play in a party, something like the FF VII remake. The mechanics, moves, spells, dodge mechanic are all fantastic. 

The art in my opinion is fantastic, I think because the characters were designed for  a video game first and not simply 2D manga characters adapted into a game like DBZ and One Piece.

I loved the presentation of the story but be aware the story itself is quite basic and it's telling colours very much inside the lines of the traditional storytelling tropes of the heroes journey, a romance subplot and a pretty basic lesson of racism is bad. 

The skits are the best part, they're little cutscene conversations that break up the world exploration and combat. However some people might find them cliche and boring. YMMV but I play a lot of horror themed games so a very simple power and romance fantasy is appealing. 

If you've read all this and are on the fence, probably DON:T try the demo. See if you can play the first hour of the game by any means available as the first hour has been my experience up to and including the third main story boss.

As time goes on, storytelling in JRPGs seems to turn games more and more into elongated television dramas with gameplay sparsely littered between scenes. Developers have forgotten how to make high impact moments interactive and therefore more satisfying. [i]Tales of Arise[/i] suffers from this prolific ailment perhaps more severely than other titles.

I do not blame [i]Tales[/i] developers for this phenomenon, as it has become the prevailing standard. I do, however, consider it a shame since the gameplay elements truly shine. [i]Tales of Arise[/i] boasts one of the most engaging combat systems in the genre with a leveling up of the [i]Tales[/i]' series iconic blend of action combat and JRPG character development and building. The writers and designers also paced the implementation of new factors like boost, combos, and over limit almost perfectly, putting the storytelling itself to shame.

Ability and title unlocking makes the side content far more rewarding, turning the experience of the game into something of a [i]Kinder Egg[/i] opening, pushing each character forward in unexpected ways at different moments. As someone who also spent a great deal of time mastering and playing with each character, they all have a unique design and playstyle that keeps the system challenging and rewarding throughout the game just by switching the character the player controls periodically and makes one eager to try higher difficulty levels like Unknown or Chaos.

Much has been said in praise of [i]Tales[/i] combat, however, so I have almost nothing new to offer. I just wish the writers and game designers realized that this was where [i]Arise[/i] performs best. The storytelling is filled with tropes and retreaded content. Character interactions are sometimes funny, but never engaging or dynamic based upon player decision-making. Especially toward the end, watching cutscenes and skits turns into a chore for achievement unlocking rather than a reward for conquering the recent challenging boss the way I remember the cinematic JRPG experience feeling in the 90's and early 2000's.

If you've played JRPGs or watched anime before, I guarantee you will miss nothing interesting by skipping every cutscene. For whatever reason, the developers seem to believe that [i]Tales of Arise[/i] is a masterpiece of storytelling and cinematography, when it is not, which makes the elongated cutscenes practically insufferable. Many times, I would leave the game running and walk away to do chores until a cinematic or dialogue sequence finished, and I can't say the story was nuanced or interesting enough for me to ever wonder what happened. The optional content also lacks creativity and challenge beyond continuing to enjoy and experience the base combat system and unlock more of its secrets. The most challenging bosses are retreads of story bosses.

Having played and acquired every achievement available in the base game of [i]Tales of Arise[/i], I wholeheartedly recommend getting stuck into it and experiencing every facet of its gameplay. Unfortunately, the story is not part of that.

Skip the cutscenes. Thank me later.",1704455038,1704455038,True,16,0,0.612551748752593994,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, the game is playable, it's not completely unpleasant either.
It's just.. fairly bad, especially in comparison to higher standards I set from the previous Tales of, and something I absolutely hope does not get repeated.

And I don't usually do negative reviews. 
I swear I began typing this telling myself I'd keep it short and sweet, in doted-list format.

[h3] Pros [/h3]

[b]The technical execution[/b] is good. While the setting of the game is not aligned with my personal aesthetic preference for the most part, you got to admit the games is probably the most beautiful Tales of Yet, as it should be, given chronology of releases. 

Combat is also fairly fluid, there are varieties of gameplay approaches with different characters, all relatively easy to get used to but with enough difference to make it worthwhile to try them. Level design is generally well thought of, making sure exploiting the combat point system is an actual challenge (if you're rushing you're in a real rush, you can't just stroll around), and doing full exploration comes at a cost that can make it overall more challenging if you want to single-pass all dungeons. 
It's the classic Tales of system, [i]properly executed[/i]. 

The music is.. it's okay.

[h3] Cons [/h3]

[b] Baseline: redundancy. [/b] The game overall feels [i] extremely rushed. [/i]

[b] Combat[/b]: I just said combat was one of the better part of the game, right? Well that's the technical execution of it. Beside that, the enemies can feel even more repetitive than in previous Tales of Instalments, simply becoming larger damage sponge as the game progresses. The diversity of Artes (combat moves) also seems to have plunged for the worse, with an unordinarily high ratio of them being shared between allies and foes alike.

[b] World[/b]: 
One of the things I really loved about Tales of Berseria, and what I generally like about JRPG, is how breathing and alive the world can feel. Walking around towns and talking to various characters, you'd usually get to learn more about them, [i] their life [/i] and how the things you do affect [i] them as unique individuals [/i]. NPC would move around and evolve as you progress down the story, making going back to different part of the map a refreshing experience rather than an annoying chore. 

In Tales of Arise, most of the World variety in how the world is in the physical layout, each ""region"" having a different visual skin and, in the initial state of the world, a unique culture. That unique culture however doesn't go in any level of depths considering individuals: during the first pass of any given ""region"", all characters basically tell you the same thing, which is indeed unique (in some aspect) to that region. 

Once you complete a region, in any given time of the story, in any given part of the (completed) world, every character is acting the same, thinking the same and telling the same. [i]This is extremely ironic considering the theme of the story.[/i] Characters content is also not always updated to be consistent with your progression. 

Dungeons also don't have a lot of unique mechanics, or these are exploited once only rather than building an entirely new/refreshing gameplay experience. 

[b] Story[/b]: 
Usual Hero quest with step-by-step execution which """"""slowly"""""" unveil a bigger scheme affecting the whole world (as is usually the case in Tales Of, gotta have high stakes), except it's unveiled all at once and the story is clearly split into two parts. 

The first half is itself split into five arcs, with mild resemblances but overall fair variety. The same topic is addressed in all sub-parts, but from a different standpoint. Honestly this is generally well made and might simply not be to my liking / too shallow to make it into the pros. Or maybe it's being overshadowed by all the extremely annoying cons of the rest of the storytelling.

[spoiler]
The theme of the story is racism, the sub-topic addressed in each region is oppression and we observe how states can control their people through, respectively:
1. sheer violence,
2. control and pitting them against one another (1984 style),
3. giving them semblance of freedom and ways of evasion (notice how a lot of people have alcohol problem in the third region, anyone?),
4. [skipped, lol]
5. Extreme fear, akin to what is achieved when controlling through religion.

An interesting approach and subject for a game, which could have been fairly nice if explored in more depth. [/spoiler]
 
The second part gets wilder, weirder and is not addressed as ""cleanly"" or naturally as you would expect, it feels rushed. A lot of the cutscenes follow ones-another and/or are reformulation of the same ideas, as if the writers assumed we (clients) were unable to absorb information if presented to us only twice. 

Or maybe they had quotas to fill and realised too late that they didn't have nearly enough depth to their story and characters to actually reach them.
Rushed Redundancy, basically. 

[b] Characters[/b]:
Only considering playable or really important characters, because as mentioned above, NPCs are not really people in this game, you'll still have a hard time finding difference between them, visual asides. 

Each playable character's character development is handled in two part, one is their personal struggles facing something unique to themselves, which occupies the smallest screen time, and the other, associated to the main story theme, [spoiler]racism, [/spoiler] takes the vast majority of screen time and will have each character go through the same 6 or so stages, repeated almost as-is for all.
[spoiler]1. ""I hate all these people""
2. ""These people are all horrible, but there might be some exception"" 
3. ""Okay these people are all horrible, but there are ass**les in all communities"" 
4. ""Okay maybe they are not all horrible, and also the context can force people into doing horrible things"" 
5. ""Each people are their own individual"" 
6. ""Each people are their own, hopefully I can help everyone understand that fact"" [/spoiler]    

Obviously, it gets really old really quickly.

Even characters' personal struggles are relatively simple, having to do with coming to term with one's own past (or lack thereof hehe), mistakes and/or the loss of loved ones, and finding one's purpose.

The ""villains"" are mostly pure black and white villains, with no substance and no nuance, the idea of them also being people being slightly, shortly and optionally explored in a late arc of the game (which explains how the system is why people become bad, politics). This is way below standard when it comes to JRPG in general, where villains typically have some greater purpose that could be argued for or against.

[spoiler]All main characters come in obvious pairs/couples, which feels extremely artificial.[/spoiler]

[h3] Overall storytelling [/h3]

It should be obvious based on the last three aspects discussed, but I can't stress enough how much of a failure this Tales of is in term of storytelling. Purely in term of being an enjoyable experience, its fails to provide any of the depth mandatory to proper world building, character development and storytelling. A lot of the cutscenes feel like rehash of previous ones, they do not mesh seemlessly in the gameplay [i] at all [/i], and you find yourself begging for it to end.

Tales of Berseria instead had me begging for a new full-length game on Magilou (or any of the characters really, as it should it good RPGs). 

But I think one can't really talk about Tales of Arise without mentioning the elephant in the room, which is how it tries and fail to be a tool for some (positive) propaganda. I might comment about it as I'm running out of length. :') 

[i]Oh, and I don't personally care but some people might dislike how a huge chunk of the Menus screenspace is occupied by injunctions to get the DLC.[/i]",1703535782,1704320985,False,3,0,0.473000019788742065,1,True,False,False

""just remember, you can't drink alcohol until you're old enough, tee hee.""  ""don't you have shops in your town?""  this isn't tokyo, the world is all slave work camps, and has been that way for 300 years.  at least as far as the story has told me.

the gameplay is needlessly complicated, like final fantasy 13's core grid, job switching, breaking system, and other micro managing of strength gaining.  arts are fueled in battle, but healing is done with CP.  a serate currency for healing and restoration, but also for unlocking doors.  your main characters gimmick is using a special flame sword, but that damages him for large parts of his health bar for single attacks.  about half his health bar when charged, which if interrupted, the move is lost, but you still take damage from it.  your damage output is tied to your health, and everyone else has about the same amount of health as you, the same damage output, but no health drain.  so you're micromanaging your health for no real benefit.

combat takes a tedious hike when you encounter the golden boy that can break through armored defenses.  basic enemies become tanks that outlast the boss battles in time, and do not give good rewards.  there is a timer on the golden boy's ability to break enemy defenses, and it resets after he uses it.  the effect lasts about 3 seconds and then it's back to running around and dodging invulnerable enemies until the golden boy can land another boost attack.

I eagerly purchased the game at launch, but it quickly became evident that it wasn't quite what I expected. My primary draw to the Tales series has always been the combat system. For instance, Tales of Vesperia is my favorite, where I've spent hundreds of hours mastering combat across multiple playthroughs on various platforms. Despite this extensive experience, I feel I've only just begun to uncover its depth.

That said, I don't consider this game bad; it simply caters to a different audience. It seems more focused on story, exploration, and fetch quests rather than in-depth combat.

Pros:

Stunning graphics and animations.
High-quality cutscenes.
Decent voice acting.
Pleasing music.
Enjoyable battle mechanics, particularly the linking specials with teammates and boost attacks.

Cons:
Story:

The narrative feels rushed, moving from one boss to another with little in between. After only 30 hours, the game appears almost over, and I'm reluctant to progress.

Characters lack the depth of those in previous games.

Skits, typically a highlight, are frequent and overly dramatic, leading to annoyance. I often found myself skimming or skipping them.

Travel mechanics resemble a Dark Souls game, with limited resources and reliance on campfires for rest and fast travel.

Combat:

Initially, you are limited to only three art slots in battle (three for aerial and ground each), which is restrictive compared to Vesperia's more extensive system(12 on the first page, 12 on the second).

6 more slots, three for aerial and ground each are unlocked 30 hours into the game after a cutscene.

Healing arts use a finite resource (CP) instead of the traditional TP, requiring reliance on items or campfires for replenishment.

Enemies are very resilient, necessitating armor break tactics, contrasting with the more straightforward combat of previous titles.

Experience and SP gains from defeating enemies are minimal, even with boost mods.

Arts are tied to titles, some of which are behind paywalls, encouraging exploration for title hunting.

Due to low combat rewards, completing fetch quests becomes a primary way to level up.

In summary, the game feels like it intentionally limits combat in favor of exploration and questing, likely to showcase the new engine and graphics and appeal to a more casual, story-focused audience.

Edit: Learning to Enjoy the Game
I've since discovered a way to enjoy the game and have started over. Here are my steps:

step 1:Download mods from Nexus (arte cancel, enemy stagger, graphics enhancements, multiplayer mod, costumes).
step 2:Start a New Game Plus with a downloaded mod save file, selecting desired artifacts (I  chose extra art slots, difficulty modes, bonus cooking time, and ore pickups).
step 3:Use the latest cheat engine and corresponding game table to adjust SP, XP, movement speed, CP regeneration, etc.
step 4:Enjoy the game

Story: I personally love simple core structure, established in the begging and unfolding later. This game is right up my alley, I had a problem with a few latest games in that regard. It sometimes felt like the story gets scattered all over. Thankfully here I didn't get that, some turns were unexpected and I never felt bored. Each part (realm) felt unique and I found myself wondering what's next. Lately I never thought Tales were that good with story. I liked older titles in this regard more. Here characters were memorable, I love the fact that there're only 6 of them, so each one had a good compelling story behind them. Some even got character development, which is satisfying to see. Dialogues and skits made me smile a lot. New look how they were presented is a huge improvement (you can new see them all in a costumes and with attachments!). Hope they'll keep this feature in later games. 

Side-Quests: Side quests are not voiced and that'd be ok with me, but weird voice-overs (""alight"", ""yes"" and so on) the character made were not. Better just silent voice, I wish I could turn those ""Hmmm""-s off. But in terms of story I loved the fact that you mostly get side-quests after liberating an area and they actually made pretty good sense. They end up being ""kill that monster"" or ""bring me food"", pretty simple in a core. But there were always a story behind what you were doing. All in all they never felt like a chore, but it wouldn’t hurt to make them complicated. This part is probably the weakest in the game. If they were voiced, it'd be a big plus. But Tales are known for unvoiced side-quests, maybe some day they'll move on from this. 
As for the map and how you acquire side-quests -you get letter icon on your map, so it’s super easy. Map is just very well implemented in all aspects btw. 
Owls-quest is lovely, as a completionist, I love this types of quests, but when they're done with such love as this one, even more. I smiled at least 38 times at this side-activity that's for sure.
Fish Quest heavily reminded me FFXV (just way easier, thank lord) and I'm not complaining, I love it there and I love it here. 

Combat: I'm not going to say much, every review you ever watch praises this aspect. And it's true, I never felt bored fighting even standard monsters on a field. Tho I won't say Arise has that much new mechanics really, many were taken from previous games and I have no problem with it, since they reworked them a bit and wrapped it in a pretty new effects. Imho the main new feature is how unique each character feels as a supporter. You can really have a lot of fun with it. 

Equipment: I was happy to get back old-school getting equipment from vendors and chests feature with no modifications. I never was a big fan of very complex equipment modding (you have Atielier games for that, leave it there). Making weapons from monster parts was cool too. The system they provide for accessories was fun, but to tell the truth I'm not a big fan of micromanaging (but it's subjective and they made it convenient enough with replacing parts of the attached bonuses). I love the fact that each character has specific armor and weapon type that no other can use. And you can leave visible cosmetics of any weapon, that is cool small feature.
I just wish there were no vendor near each campfire, it's a bit unimmersive. Blacksmiths should be in respectful locations imho, but it's subjective. I understand they were trying to make things more convenient for the players. 

Coliseum: It's pretty standard, but i love that the bouts are not that lengthy in terms of time. Tho on the minus they kinda felt repetitive, especially group ones. 

Leveling: Titles system in this form is new and i found it interesting, it makes you satisfy conditions for characters through the whole game, but this time for leveling the character, which is more rewarding. I think it's a good new use of titles.

Graphics: It's gorgeous - the design of monsters, locations and characters are beautiful, I enjoyed it the whole game, it didn't get old anywhere. Probably the only one downfall is not that big variety of TYPEs of monsters. They differ from area to area, but using the same model. They still look great tho. 

DUNGEONS and FIELD maps: It was a biggest complaint from me throughout the latest games in the series. I'm happy to say Arise fixes that, the maps are interesting and you have fun till you get to boss fight. Still no old-school puzzles, but at least there's no boring locations that look the same, each and every location is stunning and very unique (dungeon AND fields). And with the design being so gorgeous (I mean did you see the the palaces and the cities at night!!! or jungle, I mean I literally loved all the locations), I couldn't have enough. And it's cool that transitions through a lot of dungeon locations are seamless (like ladders and pits). 

To sum this up: Starting from Xillia+ it's the best in the series from me now personally. (I'm judging from Xillia, 'cause I don't want to compare older titles, they were really much more different back then, for me modern tales start from Xilla). Arise beats all previous titles in all possible aspects, taking best old-school things and all recent changes and wraps it up in a gorgeous cover. In the next one I hope they'll work more with sub-quests and add a bit more puzzles, but other than this the game is great. If you're only starting with Tales games, I'd definitely recommend it.",1631893879,1703407624,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

(Update 12/23/23)

After finishing this game I can confidently say its a very good JRPG. Like I said before, this game is visually stunning at almost every point in the game, and makes exploration along with dialogue very enjoyable to watch. Each of the main 6 playable characters have great stories that all get varied resolutions at different points in the story. And the main story itself isn't the greatest, its still decent and enjoyable if you cab get in to it. They only real ""problems"" I had in the game was the overall pacing of the story, as it felt a little rushed at the ending scenes and areas. The other unfortunately is the combat. I ended up strongly disliking the combat and having to play on auto combat. Its feels extremely repetitive, with not feeling rewarding, and not feeling smooth after a while.

Overall, good JRPG even though there were a couple areas I didn't like. 7.5/10",1689609241,1703357204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GAMEPLAY
----------------
The basics are still the same with other Tales series; the main difference is in its more dynamic action combat. The character-building aspects are enjoyable, with numerous upgrades available such as skill learning, weapon crafting, etc.

----------------
WORLD BUILDING AND STORY
----------------
It's fun to travel to other realms that have different vibes and feelings. The only problem is that there isn't much going on in every realm aside from the main story; you just go there, follow the story, and that's it. I don't feel any attachment to any of the other realms. The story is good enough and kind of straightforward, not really complex or anything. It tries to make players feel something, but I just don't feel anything. I don't even feel anything when genocide happens; it just happens too quickly and moves on. It did try to build up emotions, but it's just not enough to make players feel anything. So the only problem is that it's not built up enough

I am above average RPG player in my 20 years of experience since Nitendo, game cube sega, etc era. I had played every FF series, every star ocean series, AC franchise, etc on multiple platforms. Enough about me, this is frankly the first tales series I picked up and played after i had finished playing the latest AC Mirage. I was bored and found this game on my other account and played. Right from the start it captivated me tbh. The story is interesting from beginning to end. 

Pro…
The storyline is really interesting and captivated albeit some element to story seems like derived from FF12 nevertheless it still is interesting.

The combat system is what I actually liked most. Fast paced, Can auto everthing if you want to or semiauto or manual which is a really nice QOL options.  The whole battle system is really polished enough for me although kinda generic imo since this is the first of tales series i played. The battle system is kinda mix match of ffXII, Star Ocean divine, mostly but i like that system. There is also mini gambit system like those games. The AG system and the other is kinda generic like star ocean divine system. So if you enjoy playing this type of battle system this game will give you full enjoyment. The battle really fast paced but manageable. Not too much grinding.

The protagonist man, he literally kept me going since I want to know more about him. Iron mask lol which is really interesting story to derive from the history of King Louis XIV france.  I do like and enjoy that mystery unfolding.

The difficulty level actually is good in this game the AI aren't that dumb at all.  You actually have to prepare for some of the fights which is first for me tbh. In other games I played I literally overgrind all the time. ( e.g. dustia grinding in ffxii) and the story content seem relatively go berserk and rampage on all of them and i didnt  have any problem not much preparation needed. This game have some leveling system which is also interesting take on balancing the game difficulty. You will never be underpowered in this game at all even in unknown difficulty but will also need a lot of focus on take on some of the bosses in the first ran thru. But in NG+ things will be easier because of devil arms.

This is the first game I felt like the gameplay graphics are better than cutscenes lol. Actually its not really fair to compare that way . Still the cutscenes took anime style and the gameplay is what you expect from latest entry to the game really polished enough to enjoy the game. 

Cons…

There is not much I actually hate about this game at all.
If I have to point out one thing it is the level system. Since I am the type of guy who wanna get OP and beat everything easily from beginning. I always find a nice way to grind at beginning all the time especially when there are stats included. I tried to get over leveled and over powered as much as I can at beginning and not to worry about those SP LP etc and level till the end of the game. Thats the type of gameplay I always used to do. I don’t wanna worry about resources either as the story unfold. I just wanna enjoy how the story unfold later in game. But thats just how I play. This game leveling system kept me from doing that to a point. This game leveling system work like how mmorpg work rather than normal solo rpg work. You stopped getting enuf exp to level up at a zone after a certain point of level difference. You will have to explore next zone and fight higher level enemies to level up more efficiently. But then I have to played another section of the game in order to get that zone. Which wont be that much of a problem for most of the player. But for me it took a bit of fun out of me. But i still am beating the crap out of the beginning mobs of the next zone easily so its like there is a cap to how overpower you can get at each point of story. Thats why I said it is good and bad in previous section. But still the game  never let you get underpowered either so it is balanced. 
The price tag is steep that is another cons of this game. So not worry about cosmetic item it wont effect your game play much at all. Sure some of the mystic arte are locked behind them but you can still enjoy all the content fully without them.  Imo get this game on discount and you are set. I did buy the whole package and tried it out with and without them already and I don’t find that much of a difference. Sure you will get more attack combo that change the way you can play certain character but i mean the efficient combo are still open without locked arte. I barely used locked arte at all time. I go with opened arte.
Another con personally for me is lol, I cannot max out every stats at all without playing the game for more than 1000+ time and over 10000 hrs of game time lol thats just estimate I don’t want to calculate the exact no.  You can actually max 3 stats within 4-5 hrs with turbo controller cheese and left it over night. But the 3 defensive stats cannot be maxed out the above mentioned time lol. 
I tried to max out every stat in most of the game i played at post game and this game wont let me do that efficiently. That is just my opinion. You dont need to do that the max cap for each stat is 9999 and you can actually beat every single content including post game bosses with around 1500ish in all those stats. So there is not worry about that it is just my OCD playstyle that I want to do that lol. 

For most rpg player out there will find this game really enjoyable.

Each [b]character[/b] introduced is fully fleshed out with a distinct story and personality, and each one has a very different playstyle. Which means you don't have to stick to the main character, you can try all of them as you please.

I initially started with the blazing sword (main guy), but ended up unexpectedly enjoying Rinwell a lot more. For each playstyle, just like the game, if you learn it well, you will do well and it is pretty rewarding to see the damage output. And the combat, oh the combat, it just gets better and better as you do more, and the game does a great job of having different teammates work together.

Each character has armor and accessories, which let you emphasize their strengths. There are also outfits that you can earn by doing various subquests. I liked that most of the cosmetics are simply locked behind progression. 

The [b]environments[/b] are beautifully crafted and wonderful to explore, and indeed there is lots of exploring to do, and to be rewarded by. 

I really like that the game carefully paces how much [b]experience[/b] you get, so that you're unable to overlevel for the next story encounter, and as a result it always feels like you've _just about_ scraped by. It really adds to that feeling of 'us against the world', or a ragtag bunch fighting against forces much more powerful than themselves. 


The [b]music[/b] wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible, it did work well enough to set the tone for the game.

On the one hand, the combat system is amazing, when first starting It felt so smooth, and when I learned to chain together combos with my allies and juggling an enemy forever keeping combos of over 100 hits just a few hours in. That was very fun!

But what good is this amazing combo combat when every single boss is immune to it?? I'm not kidding about this point. every single boss, whether as big as a building or smaller than a person, will not react to the combo system, no matter what you do. The most you can do is ""stagger"" them with special actions that you can only do every couple minutes, and most of them have to be at the right time. and the stagger just makes them stop attacking for a couple seconds at most, but they still won't react to your hits or combos themselves.

This wouldn't be the biggest problem, if every boss after the first couple didn't take forever to die. On Normal difficulty a boss fight can easily take over 15 minutes. 15 minutes of hitting a wall, dodge roll spamming, and using healing items every so often, especially on your party members. Its very mind numbing.

After The second Lord, I hated almost every boss battle. at the game's midpoint I finally decided to switch to an easier difficulty, and I still hated it, mostly because most battles were still taking too long, only difference is that I wasn't dying due to less damage numbers.

The amazing combo combat system also gets a bit boring, because it doesn't evolve much, its very similar your first 5 hours to what you are doing 50 hours in.  But to be fair, that's a thing with most long rpgs, not really a point agaisn't it.

What's a point against the game though, is the story. What the heck happened to the writers after the first half of the game??? Its... bad, the pacing is incredibly off, and the story itself is mostly stupid with a lot of contrived reasons for things to be happening.

The more I think about it, I feel like they rushed to finish the game, at first every boss has one or even two cool reaction actions unique to them that no other boss has, like the light boss getting punched very hard by Law. Or Rinwell using a special spell on the dragon lady. However, after the first half, not a single boss has anything like that.

I'm just so mixed on the game. Out of all the tales games I played, this one is the one I enjoyed the least. Lovely combat system, very interesting world, ruined by terrible writing on the second half of the game, absolutely mind numbing bosses, and lack of direction for a good part of the game. 

Started strong for me, ended up pretty bad.

Pros:
*likeable characters
*skits and story sequences till endgame(but unfortunately not at the final stretch) are evenly spread that it makes it feel very well paced
*Voice line dialouges while randomly exploring the world make the party feel more alive.
*tries to put more serious themes in its story
*graphics

Cons:
*The game overstays it's welcome. At one point i felt like the game was ending but suddenly it got prolonged and stretched.
Usually when doing a subquest or a dungeon the game would give you the option to just teleport back.
This stops at some mid to endgame dungeon and even the characters ingame are annoyed by it and mention that they ""really have to walk back all the way"". 
This is where the game falls apart imo:
* The final strech has exposition dumps. You kinda get pumped at first since you think that  the game will end but you're getting blue balled instead.
After that:
*They put you in an area that has elite mobs that take a long as time to finish off and the area is huge. I skipped the mobs by fleeing from encounters which put me at the risk of being underleveled for the boss (which luckily wasnt the case), but it still took hours.
After finishing the area the area got mirrored and I had to drag myself through that slog again.

At that point i felt that the game was disrespecting my time until i fought the final boss, which took longer and longer for reasons i wont spoil.
*even though the combat system is fun it gets old near the end because they spam you with enemies.
*final story part is dumb af


This game could have been easily an 8 or even more but they fucked it up.

Although I can't really say that I didn't enjoy the game at all, the question is ""Do you recommend this game?"", in which I can't really do that, especially at full price.

On the surface it has what you'd really want from a game of this sort.
Nice graphics, fun and fluid combat, good voice acting, companions and banter between them and a story to follow.
The music is quite nice as well.
But unfortunately the execution of most aspects of the game is quite lacking.

The dialogue in the game is.. bad.
This isn't the first JRPG I have played at all, and while most can feel quite anime, be ""Cringy""/extra and so on, the dialogue in Tales of Arise a lot of the times felt just... Unnecessary. There's so much of it and a lot of it feels filler, uninteresting and either takes itself too seriously when it shouldn't or too lightly when it also shouldn't. The characters also over analyze or explain things that are way too obvious.

The story itself wasn't really good either. Without going into any spoilers, it goes all over the place all the time. There's no consistency, things don't really make sense if you turn off your suspension of disbelief. It relies on constant ""Twists"", but each one made the story more boring/generic, made the pacing worse, and brought on more and more exposition dumps.
A story that started off as the treatment and liberation of slaves, went on a completely different route.

I don't hate the characters, but there isn't anything really special about any of them. Fairly generic and not memorable.
The righteous Hero main character, the Tsundere romantic interest, the comic relief silly brute, the ""mom""/responsible one, the hotheaded young girl/kid and the weird guy that takes himself way too seriously. Mind you these tropes CAN work, for example Persona 5 did things quite similarly, but it was executed better.
They had at times funny interactions and banter, but due to the terrible dialogue, usually it just felt like a waste of time.
I just finished the game, and I can already barely remember the names of most side characters, villains and even locations.

Like most JRPGs, most side content is uninspired, uninteresting and not even voiceacted.

The looting/gear system feels completely redundant and tacked on is pretty much exactly the same as any other JRPG.
The chests you find around the world consist of either materials that you get from fighting enemies from roughly the same zone anyways, healing items and the level/zone appropriate armor piece for your character. The gear itself is simply just slightly higher numbers than the previous, so there isn't really any reason to choose between different armors, but just equipping the newest one you got.

Combat itself is actually quite fun and fluid, but sadly the way fights are implemented isn't the most entertaining.
Regular fights are fun, though some can even be too quick/easy, but whenever you face any ""Boss"" enemy, the fights just drag on. Bosses are damage sponges and feel like battles of attrition rather of skill or strategy.

Although wasn't the case for me, It seems that originally the game was also supposed to be a bit grindy as I noticed in my version of the game was included with EXP and currency buffs and yet it felt like I managed just about with them.
I'm imagining that without them I would've had to farm to progress at some point.

If you enjoy JRPGs and already know the lows and highs of games of the genre, then there is fun to be had here, especially if you get the game cheap.

What I want from a Tales game is not great gameplay, but fun and memorable characters, captivating story, bittersweet endings.

There will be minor spoiler but nothing major.

Let's start with the basics, the game graphics are improved but a bit odd feeling. You will get used to it. I find it weird they didn't use the same shader that they used in code vein, scarlet nexus or others. They add this smudge weird painterly look.

The skits and in game animations are okay, there is less 2D ufotable animation cutscenes. I don't really enjoy the fact they used a comic or manga style to present those skits. Since if you play with the original voice (JP) you will be struggling to read the subtitles and enjoy the skits itself.

The sound and music is one of my biggest grief in this game. Nothing really sound epic or blast you adrenaline like the main menu of code vein, tales of zestiria, berseria and more. It sound like a lot more generic commercial. The in-game track isn't worth even noticing. At no point I felt that it was stunning, just okay forgettable.

The combat is an improvement compare to the old system but the party menu could be improved and be more intuitive. There is still a lot of potential for improvement. I still highly dislike those mobs respawn system, force battle because the mobs block the path.

There is a bigger grief for me is the loading screen and map size. You want to enter a cabin/room you will get a loading screen. Come on, this is past 2010 limitation of hardware. Let us open the door of the cabin or room and do away with loading for such tiny spaces. Same with loading an elevator + small 10m corridor of nothing to go to another location. This is silly, it feels like a meme at this point. I do understand it for big terrains and maps but for just a tiny corridor and a cabin? It seems to be a legacy thing for console, they could have done it better for PC.

The new skill tree system looks nice but actually is so bad to tell you what you are actually getting, they try to reinvent it but it's not readable and I barely cared about it. Just unlock stuff without care.
Cosmetic slot is limited to 2, come on, give us more. Let us have that freedom you gave us in other titles to customize our character. A bit of a step backward in terms of technology.

Let's now address the story issues. It feels like I am watching an american colonialism clicher story (Avatar movie), korean drama TV show and Japanese typical main protagonist trope with his naive idea of justice vs reality.
Like 3 writers never really communicated on what they were writing for each individual arcs, thus the end resolution felt the worse underwhelming delivery. You go through such a long dungeon for a nothing burger. The pay-off is bad, very bad.
This feels like how crysis 1 felt. First you fight with a clear goal, then ""aliens"" appear and nothing makes sense and THE END.
Who in the writing team thought that emulating crysis plot structure was a good idea in a Tales game?
We had a strong cast with Tales of Vesperia, Zestiria, Berseria and this one is one of the weakest cast with a poor world building. The whole universe felt dead. They should take a page from the series: The Legend of Heroes for the NPC dialogue, world building and music.

This is one of those games where you need to play 5h to get to like a bit the character then start to enjoy it. But once you enjoy them, the game ends and you absolutely fell that the whole story was rushed since too much plot holes appears.

Once you reach the end credits, the music is barely noticeable, the small illustration is minimal compared to other titles.
Overall, one of the worse modern Tales of game for their plot and cast, everything is forgettable and lack impact or depth.
Honestly, I expected more from that game but not much came out. I am more disappointed I didn't get attached to them like I was with previous titles.

- This game has very stunning graphics that looks really good and amazing visual designs for every realms and worlds that you will be visiting. 
- Audio and OST is REALLY good. I liked both of the openings and the ending OST of the game. 
- Combat animations are really good and flashy.
- There are a lot of enemy and boss variety and their design looks really good.

Things I didn't like:
- Combat can get spammy and repetitive after a while.
- Some bosses tied in the main story of the game didn't have a satisfying conclusion when defeating them.
- The game can get a little grindy especially on the final level.

Look at my convenient power-ups. Look at my cape. Hey Law let me quote your daddy over 20 times in this game like I knew him for years even though I only knew him a week tops."" (3 hours ingame)

-  This main cast sucks compared to the other games. You can skip all of Law, and Alphens dialogue and won't miss a thing. It will be recapped by another character right away.  
-  These characters go on and on about how they are friends in one cutscene, but in the next they quickly act like coworkers.  Here is an example 
Character A says something. Character B gets offended. Character C says  ""watch what you say"" repeat this about...30+ times throughout the game. Every single main character gets told to watch their mouth by another main character.  If you take a shot of GreyGoose everytime you hear the word sorry. YOU DEAD!

The story is enjoyable, great OST, good voice work, graphics that are good/artistic, deep themes, interesting character arcs. Solid gameplay that feels good to master, and a diverse party that adds variety to the way the game can be played (can control any member to suit your playstyle).

What isn't quite so good:

Enemies can be tanky, especially in the latter stages (and in the DLC in particular) making some fights go on a while if underleveled. Not a lot of enemy variety, and during the DLC expansion there wasn't much new areas or new interesting enemies. I'd say get the DLC when it's on sale, not full price unless you are really itching to continue the story.

Overall:

I highly recommend it. One of my favourite Tales games and one of the better action JRPGs out there I think.

From the outset, the narrative grabs you, weaving a rich tapestry of themes like freedom, oppression, and the complexities of revolution. The characters are the heart of this tale, each with their own compelling backstories and growth arcs. As they journey together, their interactions and evolving relationships add layers of depth to both their individual stories and the game's world. The way they change and influence each other is beautifully portrayed, making it more than just a game; it's a journey through lives that grow and change in meaningful ways. Tales of Arise is a masterpiece, offering not just a fun gaming experience but a story that stays with you long after you put the controller down.",1701239796,1701239796,True,2,0,0.519595324993133545,0,True,False,False

The game’s combat is hyper fun! When it comes to action RPGs there are a few games that has done it right - FF 7 remake and now Tales of Arise.  This game addresses the problem for most players who are not a fan of leveling up. The excellent combat makes grinding welcoming need to do due to the share fun of it. 

The boss battles are one the best experiences I have ever experienced in a game of this genre. The cinematic shots and coupled with the artistic fight choreography is something to be hold. 

The game does have some short comings, like the story, it is nothing memorable - I honestly cannot remember what the characters were fighting for months after I completed the game. 

Nonetheless, Tales of Arise is a good game. The combat, artistic direction of the world, characters, and the share fun of leveling up will keep one coming back for more. 

I am hoping for the next Tales game to focus more on good story telling and then we will have series that is better than Final Fantasy.

Graphics are absolutely gorgeous considering how incredibly well optimized the game is. As for the music, to put it simply I found myself idling in one place just listening to it more than I care to admit to, which speaks for itself.

I recommend approaching this title with a hefty amount of free time to fully experience all that it has to offer as the main game took me about 90h to finish everything and additional ~20h for dlc.

The DLC itself is a nice addition to the story happening a year after the main game ended but I'd argue about it's worth of the full price. Go for it if you really loved the story and it's characters and seek more of their wacky adventures and interactions, otherwise wait for the sale as it isn't as big in content department as it makes itself seem so.

I have to drop it for months because I cannot stand the cringe and non-sense story of the late game. Its just So Bad like a teenager's fantasy dream. No reason nor connection of each events or just made up a non-sense reason to explain.



Only 3/10 for me. Cannot compare to previous Tales game.
Pro
-Beautiful graphic. Effects and Maps
-Good sound effect
-Good voice acting.
-Beautiful spell and Artes.
-Interesting skill system But a bit letdown in skill variety.
-Good item system YET it felt too easy despite too many materials needed to farm and hunt.
CON
-BAD MAIN STORY. Not very enjoyable and very easy to predict outcome. 
-Good character setup BUT Bad at implement. Like they usually do stupid things just to convey some cool lines.
-Character usual have ""Skit"" like other Tales BUT the serious, deadly, starvation and conflict of the main theme do not go well with the chitchat AT ALL. Like someone just lost a family member but still complain about bad food around the bonfire.
-Unforgivable too little combat option. AI both allied and enemy are too stupid and cannot give them target or roles.
-Combat roles and play styles are restricted to characters. It's quite common in RPG but this game is seriously restricted with very little to adjust or buid.
-NO Worldmap. This make it a lot less interesting into the situation. I have no fcking idea how the world or each city looks like or which direction to go. only to follow the quest mark.
-Many animations feel very cut-cost production. No door action, character actions, environments and even some storyline action. Just hide it with the screen edge or fade black and it felt really off, incomplete, cheap.
-The second skill button set is locked until almost middle of the game FOR WHAT? For Fuck sake this is unacceptable. 
-Merchants ALWAYS go ahead of you and this felt odd. It's convenient but not in a good way.

Summery
This game is an ok game BUT the previous Tales are a lot better even Zestriria. Not even close to Abyss or Eternia or Symphonia.
Better port older titles to PC Than create this bad game to destroy the series' name.

The decent japanese style action RPG combat system does not make up for the several failings of the game. 

No variety - all zones/dungeons are just a single corridor with recolored monsters you have fought dozens/hundreds of times already. Bosses and elite monsters will be repeated often. The expansion (horrible fake expansion btw) features no new areas, no new monsters, and no new character skills. Even the final zone of the game which is supposed to be the 'oh shit what are we doing' type of culmination of the adventure, features recolored monsters you have fought before, exclusively. They couldn't even cough up a single new enemy type for the final zone of the game.

Horrible and excessive dialogue - there are probably 15 hours of voice over dialogue in this 50-ish hour campaign. This wouldn't be a problem if it was interesting, but its not, its 90% trivial uninspired and uninteresting banter or whining. The last zone of the game features about 5 hours (not even kidding) of voice over exposition, since the game failed to impart necessary information along the way. It's some sort of 'big reveal', but its drawn out for literally (I am not exagerrating), hours of dialogue. The story is remarkably boring anime cringe (I bought an anime game so I was expecting this), but I was hoping for some novelty in that regard. 

Horrible loot - there are chest and boxes in the world. Most of the time they contain a potion or literally monster parts from the same monsters you fought to get to the chest. There is the occasional gear chest which contains upgrades, but are few and far between. It's incredibly boring and disappointing to open a chest that contains something that drops from the same monsters in the zone. What the hell.

Horrible gear/items - gear progression is almost entirely linear with minor % upgrades that you have to keep up with. The gear has no interesting stats, its just 'more everything'. There are weapons that improve certain elemental attacks, but because the item power progression is linear, these boosting items are pointless to use since you will miss out on raw stats. 

The small exception to this would be the accessory crafting and skill transfer system, but this is pointless and fairly limited considering the simple selection of stats. If you were playing on the ultimate difficulty then perhaps it would be worth investing time into grinding ore and making amazing accessories for everyone.

Horrible HP sponge bosses - For most of the game, until towards the very end, you will feel like you are spending 2 or 3x as long on boss fights as you should. The mechanical variety of the boss fights are very limited, so its not even an execution heavy experience, you are just beating on a punching bag for way too long. Most boss fights in the game are like this even when you 'learn to play properly'. Towards the end when you are reaching the zenith of your power in the campaign and have all the tools from the skill trees, it starts to feel a bit better. 

Overall its hard to believe this game exists. Why make a such a long RPG full of boring, stupid, pointless garbage? Why make a horrible expansion that adds nothing to the experience except more boring, stupid, cringe dialogue? Who is this game even for? 

I don't know, and I don't have the answers obviously. I realized I wasn't having fun at about the 30 hour mark, and just sort of assumed based off of where the plot was at, that it would be over soon. I was wrong, and just sort hung on, and on, and on, until things finally came to a close. I was glad it was over. I finished it sort of out of spite and sort of out of amazement and annoyance. I just couldn't believe it wasn't done yet, and was curious to see just how far they could drag it out.",1700932628,1700970425,False,7,0,0.54876941442489624,0,True,False,False

    * Exceptional Qualities *
STORY. Due to its presentation (character design, title music, etc) I expected anime cliche. I expected to not like the game but get a solid JRPG experience out of it. I was wrong. This is now one of my favourite games and easily the best of the year.
-SLAVERY & MORALITY: The story is phenomenal. An accessible and yet thorough and mature examination of slavery and social control, and the consequences of ending it. It becomes increasingly nuanced as the story progress.
-FOUND FAMILY: The main characters come from wildly different backgrounds, some of whom wish bodily harm to one another on first meeting, for believable and non-petty reasons. But by the end of it, they're a deeply connected family, cherished friends. Writing that sort of transition and taking advantage of long form storytelling to do it -- that is NOT easy, and they knocked it out of the park. I was deeply invested in these characters and their well-being and inspired by their perseverance, courage, and willingness to change. This will be a treasured memory for me.
-ROMANCE: It was great. I don't want to spoil it. It was a great journey, from nearly enemies to deep and unquestioned confidence in one another. The story even took time to examine how much of their feelings were due to circumstance or something deeper.
-VOICE ACTING: Truly fantastic on most of the main characters. All the female VAs were exceptional, even minor characters! Other supporting characters ranged from competent to good.

    + Strengths +
-COMBAT is a blast. I didn't even want the game to end, but there's plenty of extras to enjoy if you want to keep mastering characters and beefing up your skills, including a New Game +.
-LEVEL DESIGN is gorgeous and cleverly arranged. Gold standard quality of life stuff, like progress points and always clearly warning you when you reach a point of no return.
-MUSIC punches way above its weight. While not all of it is memorable, it's frequently complex, intensely emotional, rich, polished, beautiful, and always fitting to the area and situation.

    = Weaknesses =
-The ART and CHARACTER DESIGNS aren't anything to write home about, but the information delivery is truly poor. It's so common for players to spend a few dozen hours in the game and have totally missed crucial, fundamental mechanics, tooltips are vague, mystifying or absent success indicators, and on and on.

Once past the new game struggle, however, we can start to see the plot appeal and character development to this game, outside of the battle system.

PROS:

+ Probably the prettiest JRPG I have ever played. The flame particles in the sky, the planet looming overhead, Iron Mask's Flame Sword, it's all so gorgeous! I know it's cliche, but it really feels like playing an Anime.

+ High production value all round. The voice acting, animations, etc. Made me go ""Is this really a Tales game?""

+ Story starts off really strong and makes you care for Iron Mask's plight. (Redacting his real name for Spoilers)

+ A very good PC port. High settings 1080P and 60 FPS achieved with a GTX 1070.

+ Characters each have a role in the party, you can play as each one and they all feel so different to play as!

+ I could not help but laugh at the cute Owl's you find in the areas, even though the tone of the game is bleak, these owls appear and make their stupid noises and it's funny because they clash with the tone.

CONS:

- So much TALKING. I know the skits are optional but If I don't listen to them, I miss out on key character details.

- Shionne is hard to like, very typical Tsundere character who b*tches at Iron Mask when she is pretending not to be hungry or sneezing.

- Damage sponge enemies and bosses, even on lower difficulty. Fights just drag on. (and I saw a review that says this gets worse. Tempted to put a thumbs down because of this ""feature"" but the game has not irritated me that much)

- DLC practice for buying Arte's, Arte's behind a paywall. Pretty terrible if I do say so myself.

- You know how in a JRPG it can be fun to grind? Well, this game scales the experience by making it so old enemies give you a tiny bit of the EXP they would normally give you. You have to play along with the games way of progress and not your own, and I really dislike that.

- Motoi Sakuraba is known for his high energy battle themes. So far, this game has been mostly orchestral with toned down music. Not his best work.

Overall, the game is super pretty and a marvel to look at, but it needs more to grab my interest. I don't usually review games before beating them but I will make an exception in this case. I feel I have seen enough of what the game is like and I may never beat it. (Will update the game if I do) 

 I do recommend especially on sale, but it doesn't feel as ""Fun"" as past Tales games did. So why am I recommending it? Well, it's a JRPG with really high production values and that's rare to come across outside of Persona, Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. The Tales series has come on leaps and bounds for sure.",1700736394,1700736843,True,43,3,0.76547539234161377,0,True,False,False

maybe I'll be back someday to finish it. just to see how the story ends

Update: Just finished it, yap not loving it.
so many bad things could be avoided if these characters were not just standing around mindlessly while letting the bad guys take all the opportunity to do something that could potentially lead to something really bad, I know it's necessary to progress the plot BUT at least they could try to do something even if it's futile instead of just staring, they had magic and gun just for decoration *shrugs*.

at one point in the story, there is a very IMPORTANT item (It's Very IMPORTANT) that they need so badly right in front of them instead of taking it first, they had to talk to this bad guy first for like 5 minutes, why is there no one in the party take the item. they're just watching the MC talk to this bad guy and eventually, that item gets taken by another bad guy like whyyyy, why not just secure the item first and then talk to the bad guy and maybe somehow the party got surprised attacked by the other party and then the item got taken or something. it's just ridiculous it made me angry watching it and that is just one of them there are more similar scenes that happened like that in the game.

They have certainly improved the upgrading equipment system from their previous title, Berseria, which was a mess to begin with. However, the story leaves much to be desired and characters feel uninspired. The antagonists are evil for the sake of being evil and the reason as to why they are doing evil deeds are weak. The protagonists aren't that great nor bad from other titles, but they serve well. The QoL features of this game are enjoyable as you can fish and hang out with your party members to bond with them, but for some reason you can only bond with them per hour real time which is an odd decision. 

One main thing that I absolutely hate about this game is how it markets and advertises itself. I don't like how it completely screws previous buyers to not being able to upgrade to the Ultimate Edition which doesn't contain all DLCs btw, and we still have to buy it separately for more money. It feels so scummy that they just leave it like that even though they have the opportunity and power to fix that issue but choose not to.

Nonetheless, this game is taking the right step in modernizing this beloved franchise. The content, gameplay experience, and graphic improvement is the right step, but the way it markets itself and it basically forces people to pay unnecessarily more is just scummy.

I will try to explain the reasons why low score even when I got all achievements. I still recommend this game but with BIG caveats. I play Tales of Zestiria and Berseria before, while it’s only 2 Tales games I spent a lot of time on other J-RPGs. TLDR at the bottom.

The story premise is actually good with colonialism and racism with actual adult characters in tales game, this is the first time they are doing it. I can bear the usual J-RPG dialogue about friendship, I like this genre after all, thankfully this game mentions less about it so it’s a plus. That being said Tales of Arise story best described as a ‘missed opportunity’, it should be 2 games like Tales of xillia and Tales of xillia 2 because the scope is too many and too big for one game. Here Bandai Namco made pacing of the game fast so it can be completed in one J-RPG game but it actually makes story inconsistent even though there’s repeatable story session like defeating one lord to another for 5 times (this is explained pretty early so don’t worry), dahna is a planet but the world feels small because how rushed the story is.

Now onto the last 25% story part. The easiest way to describe is that 25% should be 50% of the story. Bamco really needs to delay this game 1 more year. Make it longer and got more weight each session. I can bear 75% part but the last 25% is…. just happen. All those lore dumping at once in only a short time to reveal something, [b]it’s TOO FAST![/b] . The reveal is just for the sake of being there as an obstacle for the party to overcome and explained suddenly. Tales games always have story skits, you know like comic panels but mostly it’s just party banter like usual tales games, it should explain the lore more and interesting facts about the world for Tales of Arise case. Berseria's story is great because it stays to [b]ONE[/b] problem but there are many stories to deliver to go there while Arise's story branched out too much makes the story ‘mediocre at best’. 

The plot hole happens few times, new things introduced to the story but never mentioned again and some of them left unanswered. The way new NPCs introduced on main story and suddenly gone gives bad feeling that he/she only there so the plot progress. I am already too far grinding story, items, and side content before realizing this so might as well complete all achievements. Honestly I don't get it how this title got best RPG on the game awards 2021.

For characters, Alphen is decent but nothing special. Shionne is unbearable and not friendly, she got her reason but needs long hours of game time to explain why. Rinwell is the youngest but mature when it’s needed and goes well with Law. Law is kind of funny and stands out from other members. Kisara is the caretaker of the party and acts as a mom. While dohalim struggles to learn how a normal person should act it’s amusing and the way he talks is poetic. There are almost no memorable casts but it’s passable.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Tales of Arise combat is pretty great not gonna lie, great improvements from the previous Tales game, and the game becomes more stylish with boost attacks and boost strikes. No button mashing and spamming the same artes (skill attacks). There are dodging mechanics that is actually fun. Artes are actually cool and varied. You might stay playing this game for combat more than the story. Sadly the combat hurt itself because lack of enemy type, the normal mobs' enemies maybe can be counted with all your 10 fingers because of how few it is, there is a gigant enemies type as side content that only few are different, the rest are just bigger and harder enemies of normal type, even some main story boss design at least used TWICE. You know those old J-RPG and mobile games that same enemy types but only different colors as progress goes on? Yeah, tales of arise is like that, it’s an embarrassment for a game that boasts about different places of the world to visit and different biomes only got the same enemies with different colors, [b] and Bamco is brave enough to ask for a $60 AAA game price LOL.[/b]

All of your 4 members cast the spell and attack while screaming the name of skill, I know this is happen in all Tales games but I can see some people getting irritated about this. Too much happening on the screen in a small combat arena, making it hard to dodge and avoid damage if you use close combat characters like Alphen, Dohalim, and Law which need few hours to get used to. But if you do not use close combat characters and let AI do it, they die too fast. Bosses got too much HP make it HP / damage sponges. The AI is not good enough to play on a higher difficulty than normal on the boss stage, they like to stay in the same place when there’s an enemy projectile and attack targetting them, There is also no compensation for AI like damage reduction. A way to solve this is to change control to them and dodge, but doing it every time is pretty tiring, another one is going to artes menu to uncheck long animation arte and use arte that have short animation or use spell to attack from far away, But it’s still not good enough to justify how bad the AI is. Can change the difficulty when playing.

Gald (money) to buy items is harder to earn and everything are expensive especially orange gel that only adding 30% max of CP (stamina like to casts heal spell) , to buy one the price is 1 side quest on early game. This is my first time on J-RPG struggling getting money, you will found out runs out of gald on higher difficulties. it's bothersome from start to midgame.

[h1]Graphics and OSTs:[/h1]
The graphics are insanely good. The shaders they use to become more like watercolor painting are amazing and should be used for a few next tales games because it creates a new visual identity for J-RPG, really pleasant to look at. Tales finally use a time cycle that changes from morning to night. These are the strongest points of the game but again lack of enemy type really hurt this game a lot, only variants that different colors and were a bit stronger.

Characters model design are great. Alphen, Shionne, Kisara armor are nice. Rinwell and Dohalim looks good too while law outfit suits with his style but it can be better. The voice acting are suitable with how you expect them to sound like, fully lipsync both in japanese and english language. English dub need more expressiveness on some part but not a problem.

I don’t remember memorable OST from this game sadly except for a few like ‘Flame of Hope’ because it uses violin, the OST when fighting the third lord, and the Vocal opening and ending OST.

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
The game just passed barely for positive review, i think Tales of Arise is good J-RPG to start if you are new to the genre, maybe as your first 5 J-RPG. Clearly better than Zestiria but far worse than Berseria in terms of story. Except graphics anything else feels need 1 more year of effort to be great but the problem might be the lack of budgets that bandai namco gives to tales team and this is almost happened on every tales game. Play Tales of Arise if you are new to the genre or run out of J-RPG titles. There is another series that can be compared to this franchise called Ys, specifically Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana which is better in every way except graphics but the art direction still good to look at. Buy this game only on 60% or more sale.

[h1] Beyond the Dawn: [/h1] 
It suck so bad. No new playable characters + no new skill + no new mechanics + literally only final boss the new one + place (dungeon) only 3 that new + main story 7 hours, side quest so barebones to make the game longer to 25 hours + pre-fixed level on level 65 for ""lazy content"" + recycle map but can't visit most of them because separated title screen than main story. Play it if you want more of the characters which imho they decent nothing special except law and dohalim.",1688530632,1700542265,True,98,1,0.787107586860656738,7,True,False,False

the game-play itself is ""unwieldy"". the story constantly deteriorates as it progresses. some game mechanics are outright infuriating, and have no place in the game to begin with (i'm looking at you random, unnecessary 1 hour bonding cooldown). the skit feature that ""forces"" you to suddenly stop what you are doing and listen to ""X's"" racist-ass about to cry again, is also just awful.

it had nice visuals and character design tho so ill give credit where its due otherwise its mediocre
and the skits arent skits there full on cut scenes that last longer than 15 to 30 seconds they last like 5 minutes lol



alright i replayed it and its not as bad as i initially thought i figured out that the skits actually had something to do with the story (typically theyre just dumb comedic conversations between characters so i skip through them)

If you enjoy the game, then I would recommend Beyond the Dawn expansion. It is a rare look at a world after the real conflict happens, and what would the ramifications be. Most review outlets have this expansion around a 7/10, and those feel about right, not the current reviews on steam.

Pros
+ Great amount of content for the price
+ The combat is the best in a Tales of game
+ I love the characters and they all grow throughout the story
+ The world is beautiful, and I love the art direction

That being said it does have quite a few issues and I feel like this game could have gone from a 7.5 or 8/10 to a 9 or 9.5 if they had just put some more time and care into it.

The story is unfortunately packed full of tired and obnoxious tropes. There are a lot of unique and interesting things about the story such as the main character having a mask on for the first 1/3rd of the game, but in the end it's just a rehash of the amnesia trope.
The entire story is based around the theme of racism and it's a little heavy handed and not subtle at all.
The worst offenders are the way that characters constantly argue and get into bad situations because they refuse to just speak to one another. So many problems could have been solved if they just spoke, but instead they are constantly guarding themselves and refusing to open up. They throw it in your face with too much foreshadowing which ruins any possible surprise we might have gotten out of the eventual revelations.
For the second half of the story the party is chasing a mcguffin that can save the world and every time they get it in front of them they just stand there and talk until the enemy comes by and steals it. It's quite tiring to see it happen over and over.

The biggest shame about this game though is that you can tell that development either ran out of budget or time because the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the game is about as rushed and sloppy as Xenogears disc 2. You will literally walk down hallways fighting damage sponge monsters and listening to exposition for 10+ hours. Even worse they start throwing skits at you at a pace that will tire out even the biggest fan of the story. Imagine watching 40 minutes of story scenes only to be given 5 skits in a row. The pacing is absolutely horrible.
The story also goes from something that is very understandable and interesting in the first half to being a bunch of nonsense about energy and the will of planets and things that just don't have any impact because they are so ambiguous and ungrounded.

There is also a lot of gameplay padding near the end. You will fight tons of reskinned monsters with huge HP, you will go through dungeons that literally repeat levels rather than have unique layouts for each level and you will fight boss monsters that have a second boss as soon as you beat them just to make it take longer.

I would suggest that you use the DLC items to increase your EXP bonus as much as possible around the halfway mark of the game. This will make the monster hallways and damage sponge enemies much more tolerable. It's just a time sink with no real payoff since the battle system is fairly simple and it's just a matter of fighting the enemy long enough to win.

The game really is good, I enjoyed so much about it but it's such a shame that they opted for padding things out rather than tightening them up. This is a tales game and with the new game+ system it doesn't need to be a 50 hour game. I would have much preferred a tight 25 hours than the 50 hour slog it ended up being since there is so much to like in this game.",1698547988,1698548187,True,18,3,0.689026057720184326,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: Again, it retains similar JRPG-style flashy combat players have most likely experienced before. However, once I got the mechanics of the combat down, I found myself really enjoying the combat. Compared to other JRPGs, the combat is really responsive and smooth. I did need like 50 hours invested to get the mechanics down, though.

Difficulty: Some of the bosses are definitely tough to beat. You need to memorize attack patterns and openings. I'll be honest with myself, that's kinda obvious. No impact on my review.

Exploration: The game is pretty linear, but I found myself really invested into each area. It's a really beautiful game.

They did a fantastic job developing each party member through cut scenes and skits. And it has a perfect mix of drama intrigue and pacing. However the only downside is the combat can be a wee bit repetitive and the level scaling is a bit whack. One moment your having a casual stroll and beat up some boars. The next your having a dark souls boss fight trying not to get one shoted. The post game faces the same issue. I beat the game on normal at level 60 but most of the post game stuff is level 80-99 which seems like quite the jump for end game content. Id rather spend hours grinding the endgame area just to beat a boss that maybe drops a good weapon for my next playthrough. Other than that i recommend at least a playthrough.

[u] I would recommend the game [/u] to people who enjoy real-time combat and generally enjoy the JRPG category. [/b] I have played the game through to the end and did all side content that I possibly could. I have spent a decent amount of time playing the game after initially dropping it around two years ago and finishing it. I plan on completing a few more things to work towards 100% completion when I can. [b] But, it was not a perfect game and I have a decent amount of [u] minor gripes [/u] about my experience with it. [/b] These gripes did not overpower the big things that I enjoyed about the game and did think they did right, but [u] they were numerous enough to make note of. [/u]  That being said let me break down this further. 

[b] Important caveat: I played on NORMAL difficulty. [/b]

[h1] The major aspects I enjoyed about this game were: [/h1]
[h2] 1. The combat. [/h2]
It was enjoyable for the most part. It felt interactive, the party members we able to cater to different play styles, the timing of boost attacks and boost strikes were satisfying, and it over all felt pretty intuitive. It was really fun until the end-game where I was able to abuse specific accessories to trivialize the combat a bit using Alphen's boost attack with a Strength accessory with all BG Charge Rate stats. (Difficulty level could be affected by this.) But, that really isn't that bad of a thing because that's more on the side of optimization and it made difficult boss fights (especially if a bit under-leveled) a lot more manageable! 
[h2] 2. The party members I overall liked! [/h2]
Their interactions, their synergies, their reasons for joining the gang, all of it felt natural. You would be able to witness their character development and how they became stronger individuals while being great friends. They were all likable and really felt cohesive. 
[h2] 3. I think visually the game looks great. [/h2]
The art and the environment look distinct and appealing. You could really get a feel for the differences between the regions and the different looks of the characters. It was just a nice thing to really look at and enjoy while taking care of quest objectives. 
[h2] 4. Progression felt smooth, it wasn't really that grindy. [/h2]
As long as you took all the encounters you could along the way you wouldn't have to go back and grind much if at all. There were some times at the end of the game where I opted to refight specific optional bosses multiple times for more EXP but that is optional content and I enjoyed the fights enough and felt they were doable. If you were under-leveled the consumables definitely helped close the gap a bit and they were generous enough (but not too generous) with the game's currency and the items you could collect to where you wouldn't feel like you were short on anything. 

[h1] That being said, it does have its fair bit of downsides: [/h1]
[h2] 1. The game felt really tropey, exceedingly so. [/h2]
There is nothing wrong with using tropes in stories, they are the framework for making likable characters and stories. However, there needs to be a fair bit of deviation and care when handling it. It became a relatively big issue for really tense, climactic moments where they would just be shouting about the power of friendship at the top of their lungs. I like stories about people coming to together and relying on each other, but the delivery was not tactful enough to the point where it broke my immersion and made it difficult for me to take the moment as seriously as I should.
[h2] 2. I feel as if the second act did not compare well to the quality of the first arc. [/h2]
It wasn't necessarily bad, but I just wasn't able to maintain the same level of investment in the story. The story lost some of its charm for me at that point. It also shows that the development of the game towards the end was rushed as it feel like it did flow as well as the first act did. 
[h2] 3. Some combat cut-scenes (specifically at the very end of the game) were poorly integrated in the sense that it felt like they ended early and the transition from cut-scenes to combat was extremely jarring. [/h2]
Some of them also felt extremely unnecessary and they could have gone about moving from one situation to the next in a better, smoother manner. 
[h2] 4. There was limited enemy variety. [/h2]
I understand there are limitations to the amount of mobs a game can make and that reskinning a specific type of enemy is necessary. But, there just weren't enough base forms to work with. It made the combat feel more redundant than it should have been because the enemies that you see past some of the major bosses are all enemies that you have seen before. It made me less interested in who I was fighting and I stopped figuring out how to deal with these enemies because I had nothing new to learn.
[h2] 5. I experienced some technical issues with some of the game's basic systems. [/h2]
These could be technical issues on my end, but during some of the combat cut-scenes, (specifically for boost strikes) I might experience a freeze in the gameplay. I also had some really weird issues where I was just unable to control the camera during some fights which became extremely annoying. Otherwise, the game ran perfectly. My PC is able to run most if not all things so it was weird for it to experience something like a freeze, albeit a short one. 
[h2] 6. One specific character (Kisara) felt rather flat for me in terms of her development. [/h2]
I wouldn't say she was a poorly written character, but her frequent mentioning of her brother kind of undermined my enjoyment of what she could/did contribute. I understood her brother was a core part of her development/story. However, they could have gone about it in a much more subtle, less intrusive manner. 

[b] Again, I enjoyed this game and would recommend you to play it. The issues I mentioned were just things that bothered my during my play-through and were minor enough to not ruin my experience. [/b] I hope this helped!",1697351220,1697351256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

80 to 90 percent of the enemies you fight are re-colored variants of the first enemies you fight (and maybe with different elemental weaknesses). The small bit of variety comes from bosses and mini-bosses, but even those are often retread variants of enemies you've already encountered. The complete absence of variety means combat encounters become boring very quickly.

Speaking of combat, the gameplay in battle is probably the best part of the game, but even this breaks down. Some enemies, particularly the larger ones, have bizarre hit-boxes on things like weapons and attack areas. Lumbering giant carrying a mace? Stay five feet clear of the mace, because it will damage and stagger you if you get any closer (and no, you don't need to actually contact it). The auto-targeting system also makes bizarre decisions, causing you to potentially lunge ineffectually at an enemy halfway across the (relatively tiny) battlefield instead of the one right next to you. This is not helped by the visibility issues, where you'll often be blindsided by an enemy because they're behind the camera, or else blinded by the extreme number of large visual effects that, to be frank, should come with a seizure warning.

This game is *NOT* Open World, despite the tag. The game is *heavily* railroaded. There is a bare-minimum of dungeon crawling that you can do to discover items, but don't expect to get lost, and don't expect to stumble upon any hidden areas or secret bosses. Everything is laid out in front of you like the instructions for a color-by-number picture.

This game seems to want to straddle the line between being a cinematic experience and a hard-core challenge. It fails at both. It's a lazy, plodding, repetitive, and boring game. I wanted to like this game. I put a fair amount of time in it trying to get invested, and it continually rebuffed me.

Story: The game have good story, have emotional story for each character. There is also some light joke scene in the game make it feel not bored with the main story/side quest story

Gameplay: Compared to FF VII Remake, this game have better gameplay. I like the battle mechanics, It's simple but fun to play. Also the battle action is very intuitive which have combo variation between party's characters and elemental things was also simple to understand

Graphics: I won't compare it with FF due this game was anime RPG like. The game have unique art style and design which half 2/3D. The game also have beautiful effect for each magic or particle on the world environment.

Music: Well I just like the OST, they have good intro songs lol

Pros
⦁	Nice visuals, great anime-esque 3D graphics
⦁	Good sound, despite a pompous soundtrack
⦁	Responsive controls on the keyboard and mouse

Cons
⦁	Bland characters
⦁	Dialogue drones on and on without really telling a good story
⦁	Waaaay to many cutscenes - walk ten meters, boom theres's a cutscene
⦁	Servicable combat system, but it lacks any real depth - can seem like a chaotic and overwhelming burst of colours and effects

I prefer the cartoon era, however the adult themes of Berseria were amazing. 

Berseria and Arise realocate a lot of mind space into very high RPG or what we know as the ""Consequence"" RPG space. While not a direct opponent to this (Tales of X2), I think it's thematically not well placed here.

There is no direct gravitas on your own decisions, and the ending is not affected. While the last time a Tales game gave us this freedom was actually Xillia 2, it is definitely a step back.

All of this would matter if -anything- mattered. You are not a pawn, but you aren't exactly in charge of anything either. You kind of plod your way into this sick destiny because you hate things.

In the end, it's a compelling story and it is kind of well done, sort of half Anime version of ""Man in the Iron Mask"" and all, but it needed to be more impactful.

Berseria was a far more Justified ending to Zestiria than even itself, which was itself a tear jerker once you realize how fucked the world was because of a single man's greed to feel nothing because of his awful sacrifice.",1633115501,1696674772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You grind through an area, with healing items capped EXTREMELY low for a grindy JRPG, forcing you to rest and go back to town constantly. Due this the skit cutscenes advance and show the characters getting more developed, but when you get to the next story beat that development technically hasn't happened yet, so I felt like I was just spinning my wheels and kinda hated all the characters by the end of it.

Side quests are almost nonexistent. They copy/pasted the same couple of quests for each city. If you're lucky, one might show one of the few good character moments. Or will look very funny with dumb glasses on the characters.

World looks pretty but feels VERY empty. The NPC dialogue was just nothing. Some areas you clear stay empty, except for a couple resource nodes you can come back to, and some have some spots for the fishing minigame or a large enemy to hunt. Also the stylistic choice to put constant anime girl moans in the fishing minigame is beyond me.

The Good Stuff:

- Flashy, fun combat. More accessible than other Tales games but still satisfying to master. 
- Colourful world, good graphics, interesting spaces. Missing a lot of the jank and rough edges usually associated with this style of game.
- Well-optimised and seemingly bug-free. 108 hours played with no issues. 
- Good story (but if you're used to games being 20 hour jaunts and can't stomach more than that, maybe pass)
- Good cast of characters who manage to keep the same themes fresh for upwards of 70 hours
- Harder than FFXVI with difficulties unlocked earlier instead of reserved for NG+ because Tales isn't cringe.
- No 3rd act grind, burnout or content stretching. Very well-paced for a game of this length.
- Fishing. Some people really like fishing in video games.
- The modding community :^]


The Less Good Stuff:

- Quests don't have a level rating and you can sometimes get very high level quests early on. 
- There's quite a few kill/fetch quests. If you enjoy the combat, you won't have a problem as they almost always culminate in a big ol' boss fight. 
- NG+ is mostly pointless. Enemies don't scale to your level, there are no hidden quests, bosses or story progression. 
- Useful stuff is paywalled behind DLC.
- If you use the original Japanese dub and English subtitles, you might 'disagree' with the translation. Very minor gripe but one that i couldn't quite shake, all the way up to credits rolling. 
- Fishing. I don't like fishing in video games.

The best thing about the second half is they managed to avoid the same cookie cutter bittersweet ending JRPG trope thats been done to death so thats something I guess. Would I recommend it? I would but only to a seasoned tales player, if you can get a good deal on it and are fully aware of how the second half of the game plays out. To a first time tales player? definitely not. Go buy tales of vesperia or symphonia. they regularly go on sale for under 10 bucks and are the epitome of what good tales games are. 

ill give it a thumbs up but not because I think its an amazing tales game. its because its playable and what it does, it does well even if what it does bad, it does bad in the worst kind of way.",1695537310,1695537310,True,25,0,0.717541635036468506,1,True,False,False

That being said, here's the full honest review:

Pros - 
- Likeable main characters
- Fun enough main story
- Absolutely gorgeous art
- Awesome music
- Good battle system

Cons - 
- Battles get repetitive (especially late in the game)
- Enemies don't level with you (especially annoying for New Game +)
- Only way to get cash is to complete quests and sell stuff (no gald for battles?!)
- 90% of villains one-sided, not even interesting enough to really want to defeat them other than to progress the game

Personally, I play JRPGs to feel like I'm immersed in an anime and that's pretty much what Tales of Arise is.  If that's what you're into, perfect game.  If you're looking for ""souls like"" battling, then better look for that tag instead.

Edited to add: A bunch of people don't like all the random banter that happens when walking around or during battles.  Honestly, to me they make the characters feel more fleshed-out than even the skits do.   I mean, IRL you'd banter with your travelling companions - so having these characters chat with each other along the way makes sense.

Edited MUCH later to add:  YES!  Full soundtrack with BGMs available for purchase!  And HOLY COW!  Continuation of the story coming via DLC in a couple of months.  The story wrapped up well enough, but left much unanswered and me craving more.  But now they're actually going to show what happens a year later?!

The longer I have away, the more I dislike this game. Spoilers are at the very tail end, and will have another warning before then.

tl;dr: If you like tales games, you'll like this. Maybe not love it, but is adequate. 
Story and characters are far from the best, and aren't compelling in the end. If you want a challenge, look anywhere else. If you are new to JRPGs, there are worse ones to get into than this one. 

Pros:
-world looks is awesome
-voice acting is good
-The history/lore is alright

That's about it for solid pros from me. Oops?

Mixed:

-Character models look great upon first look, but the use in skits are terrible. Their eyes and flapping jaws look lifeless, like dolls, and it takes away a lot of charm that the old portraits had. If you played it, you'll know Berseria did this best.
-The area design can be wonderfully solid, or outright a straight shot to the end goal with minor deviance. This is one of the most linear 3D tales games. I was not impressed by the multiple small offshoots of areas that only ever go out for one map. Yet at the same time, the terrain and cities look great!
-Characters are great for 5 minutes, then they all sort of become less interesting, falling into stereotypes of a hero team and becoming far less emotionally invested as time wears on. Dohalim I think was the best written character, but for reasons later discussed, that doesn't say much.

Cons:

-There is absolutely NO subtly here. You won't need to find hidden plots. Its all at the forefront. The small moments where they try to redirect you are only that; small. This game does not have enough character, story, or even lore to make anything seem like there are cogs moving around you. It's only you, and what you happen upon.
-Puzzles are sort of here, sort of not. They're not hard, but they are mostly just to make things less of a straight line. Rarely do I feel like I've achieved something when finishing a puzzle.
-Side NPCs are there and rarely feel important for long if at all, and in the final areas, there's a slapped on 'this person is important' but has nothing for us to go off of, and then the final arc has such a drop in NPC and world building interaction, it feels lifeless and not in the way they wanted. 
-Pacing is so bad. So, so bad. The first 2 areas are solid enough, but from there everything falls apart. I'll go into details after the spoiler tag, but just know that the best written part of the game is Cysloden. 
-Battle, a HUGE part of the game, is easy. Laughably easy. Normal feels like easy mode, and harder difficulties don't even feel that challenging. Great for going on autopilot, but not for much else. I took on most bosses way more underleveled than I should have, and rarely ever used a life bottle. I'm talking like 10-15 levels underneath, including the 'end game' content. 
-Stardew Valley fishing but not as intuitive.
-Only 66 hours in, with me idling and looking at the scenery, I have 80% of the game's achievements. I'm missing a few friendships maxed out, which because I don't find the characters too compelling, I'm not the most invested in, the max level, and a few other small things like fishing. Including starting a new game plus. 
-Don't buy the DLC to level you up, you will NEVER need it. Max level is only 100, you will get there far easier than you think. 
-Ads in the campfires for DLC you don't have.
-Skills locked behind titles FROM said DLC.
-items feel useless in this game, I hardly ever used a life bottle or gels beyond CP gels.
-Honestly, I think the story fell flat at the end. Pacing being off, the story becoming bland.. Eh?
-Characters are shoehorned together into clear cut relationships, with a very clear bias on who they're being 'shipped' with. Normally that's fine, but with Literally all of the characters, and so aggressively subpar and down the throat that this barely feels like a team vs a triple date.
-Story tries to be dark, but it doesn't feel like it earns the gravitas of the situation it creates, and almost makes it a joke with how things evolve so fast at the very end of the game.

Spoiler Central:

-The final boss kicked ass, for a moment, before I realized it was basically all scripted. I love Shionne until she completely 180'd as a character, and became the damsel in distress. I loved how she advocated for herself and fought hard for what she wanted, before essentially giving it all to Alphen for his spotlight.
-I like the wedding credits, very cute but not worth the trip and isn't worth the journey. 
-The end game sucked. So bad. I loved the references to older tales games, but it just... Wasn't enough to make the journey there worth it. The references to the older games only really matter if you've played most of the 3-D games. Especially Berseria and Zestiria. 
-the final scenes just felt like a generic anime ending, with little catharsis. I had no desire to fight the hydro-punk, seeing as he too was a victim of the system and not the greatest 'evil'. It didn't feel like I was overcoming someone who had messed up. He was doing it all out of spite, which for a final boss felt like a weak conviction.
-Dohalim was a great character concept, but because they showed his flashback in the first few minutes of meeting him, instead of saving for after he went berserk made the impact FAR weaker. We already knew why, and it just made the scene overly dramatic.
-The boys are written so much better than the girls for the majority of the story but with Rinwell and Law swapping places at the end of the game. They let him kind of fade into the background, and made Rinwell more of a plot tool. 
Kisara is a typical Mom Friend, with little done to make her stand out. Her arc was all at once, all at the beginning of her introduction, and then her character feels like a background character. 
Shionne was amazing at the beginning, but becomes the damsel in distress. The part when Alphen feels pain again was heart wrenching to see her give up. But... Then she loses all agency, trusting it all to Alphen. Sure, that's romantic, but it doesn't feel like she has enough depth to give that to him. She needed it to stand on her own two legs.
Rinwell is a plot device that has her arcs hinge on someone else's action or inaction. Even her highlight of going after the comical villain that killed her family was deeply flawed in that she was talked out of it versus coming to that herself based on what she had seen from her friends.

Similarly, Alphen's 'plot twist' didn't feel emotional for me. Not because of the plot twist itself, but how he handled it didn't feel real at all. He was still acting in his time of ""grief"", and basically didn't change at all. Just, now he knows his past, none of his faults were highlighted or conquered. 
Law was REALLY strong at first. Angry at his dad, then went through the grieving process and relied on Alphen. However, toward the end, he kind of became a bandaid for Rinwell, being centered around her.
Dohalim had his arc immediately upon entry, and he shows the most changes as a character alongside Rinwell. His character's secret is literally shown to you in a cutscene when you first get to meet him. It's so, so poorly written, and unclear as to what exactly happened till later. 

Add that these characters are very clearly written to be the romantic partners of each other make them all feel so much weaker! This could've worked but it doesn't. It only serves to focus on the 'partners' instead of team building, and makes them feel less lovable. 

Don't get me started on the alien twist. It feels so out of place that it makes everything feel trivialized.

I really wanted to like this game but I don't.
If you want an easy tales game with a bland story, go for it.
If you value quality in your characters and world, this will leave you hungry for more.

The story is artificially long and padded with repeated content, and it suffers from severe pacing issues at the most important points in its plot.  

[u]My rant[/u]: The visuals are gorgeous, the voice acting is pretty good for both English and Japanese and the level and world design is amazingly gorgeous.  Combat gets a bit slower than other Tales games, but it allows the player to use all of their party mechanics like mystic artes and combo finishers regularly, which works with how gorgeous the battle system is.  And party management between battles has been boiled down to just managing CP, which is only used for healing and buffs.  All other offensive abilities and spells are now free to use.  I have mixed feelings on this, but it works to streamline combat.

So why am I giving this a thumbs down?  The story, the most important part of a JRPG, is pure frustration for me.  It's bad enough to frequently make me angry at it and good enough to make me care enough to be angry at it.  It suffers from extremely severe pacing issues, with interesting scenes suddenly being interrupted so a character can stand on their soapbox and preach to draw the scene out for another 10 minutes.  This ruins the mood so badly that it makes me not want to play Tales of Arise again whenever it happens, and it happens almost every time I start cautiously enjoying the story again.

And you won't just hear that pace destroying soapbox when you were about to confront a boss who just killed a bunch of people once.  Oooooooh no.  You're going to hear about how all renans aren't evil sooooooo many freaking times in this story (as one generic, non-spoiler example among many repeated offenses).  They pad the length of the story by constantly rehashing old lines, which also ruins character development when they keep bringing up old problems to resolve again.

I've given the story in this game several tries.  I've walked away from it to cooldown each time and come back to it a month or two later.  It's just an exercise in self torture at this point, as it utterly frustrates me to no end every time something cool happens only to have someone step up and start spewing their soap all over the place for 10 minutes and making me keep hitting skip scene because I just don't care anymore.  I don't care anymore.  And that's why I'm giving this a thumbs down and probably not going to torture myself with it further.",1643795887,1694826296,False,19,0,0.555826067924499512,0,True,False,False

The characters in this game are...good. But that's kinda it. Tales games are known for their characters, the fun skits and the relationship both you and the other characters build together over a long, long journey. This game is SO serious compared to a lot of the Tales games that it made it kind of hard for me to fall in love with characters in the same ways I have in games like Abyss or Vesperia. Those games are DARK but have so much humor thrown in that it lightens the load and makes the serious stuff SO much more effective. There's a lot to love here, still. For a Tales game, there's a medium amount going on and it's fun to learn a bit about everyone and watch the party interact.

The story...is kind of meh. Like a lot of games in this franchise the story is ever-present but rarely the real focus of what the game is trying to achieve. I'm not going to talk much about it. A couple twists and turns that are fun, but don't expect anything deep and you'll have fun with it anyway.

The combat is where I really struggle in Arise. I am in love with how sped up everything is. Usually, esp with modern entries into the franchise, combat gets bananas complicated and fast by end-game if you want to achieve high combos and massive damage output. This game achieves that from go...for regular encounters. Bosses often aren't allowed to be staggered in the same ways small enemies are. This makes it really hard to do fun, long, effective and flashy combos in boss encounters. So, kind of, what's the point of making the combat so much faster and snappy if you're going to drag it into the mud in the fights you want it to be fast in the first place?

The game looks stunning. I will tell you I'm more of a fan of the much more cel-shady-esque middle era titles, but I'm hard pressed to actually complain about what this game looks like at about any point.

Overall, this is still a strong recommend imo, esp if you're new to the series as it's a great entry point. JRPG fans will almost definitely find a decent amount to like in this game and, though it's pretty long, doesn't really feel it too often. Pacing is really nice for most of the game.

If you've played these games for years, you might run into some bumps in this one that make you a little sad or yearn for some Tales titles from yesteryear, but that's the JRPG afficianado's lament, right? Either way, if you're looking for anime af action RPG entertainment, Tales of Arise will supply this for the entirety of the game. Watch the skits and the cutscenes and just absorb as much as you can and you'll wind up falling for a character or two.",1694817529,1694817529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The cut scenes of the speech that makes Rena and Dahna want coexist willingly. 
2. Show the characters' past more instead of tell or dialogues either by skits or cut scenes. Sure, Alphen is the main character so does the rest of the group, especially Shionne

then it all falls apart quickly. sometimes jrpgs do this thing where they speedrun their conclusions by just doing a 10 hour info dump, sometimes its ok when that happens, IF the info dump is at least interesting or has a nice twist(some Trails games do this. a lot).

sadly this was not the case here. coupled with a horrible hp sponge filled final dungeon this game's ending was the part that kills the recommendation for me. 

a few more nitpicks

music. mostly atmospheric chanting horribleness. nothing to put on your playlist.
sound mixing. terrible. maybe its my sound system but I could not find a good mix of audio that would not have either the music or the voices overpowering each other.
also. get ready to hear people sigh or grumble. all. the. time. you could make a drinking game out of it. but you'll be dead after 1 scene.

 The story is very generic but the characters, their interactions with each others and the combat is the saving grace of this game. Every interaction between characters felt so natural, it's so fun to watch them grow through out the story, no forced relationships or harem and that [spoiler]kiss[/spoiler] at the end make this entire journey totally worth it. If you manage to finish the game, please don't skip the credits, I haven't had this feeling in me for a story since Toradora! and that was a long time ago.

 The game take quite awhile to feel good, early game combat is just okay, there aren't much you can do but once you unlocked 4th member and more artes, combat started to get complicated because there are so many actions you can do. The companion AIs are good I guess, maybe better than Dragon's Dogma AI because you can customize strategy for AI to do specific actions when conditions are meet.

 You can control any characters at any time and they all have different playstyle, you have a MC that can potentially do the most damage by using attacks that sacrifice his HP, a mage, a tank with a shield and a shield breaker both are melee attackers, one range character and one melee character with a variety of artes and healing artes. There's a weakness system but it rather simple, Fire beat water and water beat fire, earth and wind, light and dark, most of the time you don't really need to worry about it because casting the same arte multiple times within four actions get diminishing returns.

 You really should try out the demo and read the field guide for combat before buying the game, there aren't a lot of depths with this combat system but there are a lot of things you can do and it can be complicated especially after you unlocked your first non-DLC artifact. If you don't like the combat or JRPG then maybe ignore this game (I'd recommend Astlibra if you're new to JRPG and want to give them a try, the story is so much better).

 The game is simply just not hard because of how basic the combat system is, it's like a hybrid of turn-based JRPG with spectacle fighter, you can pause the game in middle of a fight to switch character or use an arte from a character you're not controlling, do really long amazing looking combos, no animation cancel which make the combat feel less fluid, once you hit the attack/arte button you're stuck in that animation and some can be really long. The core of the combat focus on breaking enemies and staggering them for long combo, bosses don't follow that rule, they can't be broken and their HP is massive so it's like you're hitting a rock with no response, it felt so unnatural for them to take so many hits and not being staggered even a little bit. Beating a boss doesn't feel satisfying, they feel more like a chore because the fight take way too long to finish, I never felt like I got stronger and better at the game because these bosses are always taking too long to die, they aren't hard even on hard mode but they take minutes of constant attacks to beat with my characters doing like no damage all the time. Boss fights are so much better after I installed a mod to cut 1/4 of the boss hp, spongy bosses = longer fight, not harder and super long boss fight with you using same attacks 30 times is just boring.

So why the thumbs up ? Because outside of the boss fights the game is pretty good, I enjoyed it. I find it a bit weird that post-game contents put us back before the final fight, I don't see any reasons why we can't just continue the game after saving the world. I'm actually quite disappointed that we didn't get post-game content for [spoiler]Alphen & Shionne wedding, all we get is an image from the credits, why did the NPCs get a side quest but not our MC ?[/spoiler] Damn it, I love seeing those two together and I want to see more of them.

The story largely follows what is best described as an uprising from a occupying force from another planet. As the story progresses it certainly hits some dark notes but also features well rounded characters. While this type of story may seem a bit dark and a departure from some of the previous entries in the Tales series it is still a solid entry none the less. 

At it's core the gameplay is a mixture. If you've play previous entries then this won't be much of a surprise but there is a few twists here. While the core combat does feel like button mashing at time and repeating same combo again and again where one of the biggest changes is in the healing system. Unlike other games for players to receive healing via spells the have to spend CP. While this resource can be replenished both via items and at traditional points like rest points and inns it is absolutely critical to maximising your parties efficiency especially with a dedicated healer. Also once you get more than 6 party member you can switch them out on the fly in combat but it is not critical as exp is spread to all characters. So you'll most likely find a combination that works for you and probably never change it once you've settled on the best way you like to deal with combat. At the same time all the characters have a special skill that are useful for dealing with certain foes so you'll always need someone to help deal with something. 

Graphically wise this is a very nice looking game and can really push hardware pretty hard to help render all the details. Especially at 1080p. Still very nice looking game.

I have played most of the Tales games, probably around 7-8 of them. This is the worst one by far. And this is the only Tales game I won't finish.

Game is too artificial, unnatural. Too structured. I want a living world to explore. World in this game feels like a MMO world. There is a fire region, ice region, normal (grass?) region, it probably has water region too. You go and visit them one by one. They all have similar structure. They have 1 main area, they have 1 main boss. You go one by one and do the same thing all the time. If locations were good, I wouldn't be this against it. But for example cities are terrible. They dont have anything in them, no interesting characters. In the end, world is pretty bad.

Main story is... boring. Typical, nothing interesting happens. You have few targets, that's basically it. Side quests are also boring, many of them are fetch quests.

Worst thing about the game.. Characters. This game has the worst main character I have seen in a game probably. He is just so boring. So uninteresting. Annoying. Not cool. Other characters are not better either. Of course we have Anime tropes here and that is expected but execution is bad. For example, second most important character is a tsundere women (surprised?) and she is bad too. Simply not interesting. Dialogues are also bad.

Combat is decent, progression is good. These are the only 2 things good about the game. But they can't save the game for me.

If you like medicore JRPG games, you can try it, but I can't say it is a great game or worthy of Tales title.",1694209647,1694209647,False,16,0,0.525059878826141357,0,True,False,False

Generally a very enjoyable game. The graphics are nice, the characters are entertaining, and the combat is smooth. The post-game content isn't as diverse as you would expect, but the main side-quests meant to be done are very entertaining and sufficiently difficult. Throughout the game, the skits adds perspective to the group's dynamic and world-building. There's a massive amount of these small comic-styled scenarios, and I found it very fun to find and listen to. The main locations, despite looking nice, do not feel super memorable in my opinion, only the second and third regions stood out to me. 

Though, I have some qualms with their combat system and levelling system. Some enemies feel like damage sponges despite being at the same level on Normal difficulty. It didn't exactly make the game difficult, just prolonged fights. That isn't to say the game is grindy, if you do side-quests regularly, you'll be close to pace-ish. The game tends to raise enemy levels by a couple per new area, and in some story places. It's not hard to handle a gap in levels, however. 

The first 80% of the story is a worthwhile experience. After that, it gets somewhat confusing because the pacing triples in speed, and then it's finished. Very odd, but I wouldn't say it will entirely ruin the game for you.

It took me around 15 hours to 100% it after completing the story (with post-game side-quests, collectables, and max level grinding).  

Should you buy it at full price? I wouldn't suggest it, but it is entirely worth it if it's 25% off.",1692912629,1692912629,True,15,1,0.685518980026245117,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise however is a complete dissapointment... no interesting characters.. no interesting story the gameplay hasn't evolved in any way...

Absolutely stunning world too and the english dub is AMAZING, especially fot Shionne. The beginning was a little overwhelming but it was supposed to be that way, so that we would be more inclined to know more about the world. The combat is addicting and i constantly find myself purposely triggering fights even when I am low on HP as it is so well-made. There are also bonding skits that allow your characters to learn more about each other on your journey which is I didn't think we need but was an ABSOLUTELY necessary touch to make the characters feel lifelike. The dialogues all feel lively even during a battle which also serves as a purpose to remind yourself what the enemy is doing and watching Shionne slowly warm up was great. Good entry to a tales game and a solid 9.5/10 with a seal of recommendation from me

Review after completing the game:
WOW this game is so fascinating!! The so-called act 1 was a blast to play through with recruitment of new characters, then act 2 started and with our main characters and their ambitions, it blesses us with its AMAZING lore and character interactions as they got closer to one another. Also, the game just gives you a lot of content to do while advancing the storyline, a solid 60 hours of content at least which is AMAZING as I was kinda speeding through the platinum. The ending is also ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL and I couldn't think of a better ending.. Check it out for yourself if you haven't finished the game yet. However, I felt like the 2nd act was a little slow compared to the 1st act and It's WAY more action oriented which meant not much character interactions or skits. Just pure battle interaction and the last part also felt unnatural and like a drag but I can forgive it due to the nature of these games to inflate the hours so it seem like a good deal, which it is. After a long time I have realised that there will be that 1 combat art where you just spam it out and watch your enemies health drain as there is an obvious bias for that 1 particular combat art for ahem ahem Alphen.

As you get further in the story you unlock more combat abilities to increase your combos.  However the further along you get in the game the tankier the enemies become to the point of being ridiculous,  items are extremely expensive and to make any money you have to walk back and forth in map sections to kill enemies and pick up resources which hardly gets you anything.  As soon as you get to chapter 5 the enemies health skyrockets and they hardly ever stagger causing long boring fights that barely give you any xp.  The game take a complete nosedive and becomes exceedingly repetitive and boring the pacing is awful and the cutscenes are way to long just to conclude a story that honestly is very bland.  The final dungeons of the game is a boring slog of tedious combat with high health enemies that take too long to kill only to immediately have to do it again multiple times.  It becomes a test of your patience instead of fun.  It is obvious that all the love and care for this game went into the first half.

Recommend for a tales of fan. 
For a first timer, get it on a sale.

+Graphical fidelity
+World design 
+Accesories crafting system compliments team/character building.

+-Combat, fluid, fun, mystic artes/boost attacks could've been slowed down animation wise a tad bit to let the player admire the visuals. End game (storywise) all enemies are weak to light-->highest dps is achieved by spamming few skills that exploit that weakness leading into stale gameplay. (hey, you don't have to - but i would've prefered if enemies were less spongy)

-Tapers off at the 2nd half.
-Story is largely unexplained until last 2 hours where you get a good hour long section of the game where you're mostly just scrolling through dialogue / watching cutscenes. And soon after the big bad is defeated. 
-Plot left a lot of unanswered questions. (things just happen, with no explanation )
-Sidequests are largely unforgettable
-DLC practices are becoming more and more egregious. (buy straight power from shop in the form of levels,gald and exclusive artes/titles that grant bonuses to your character)
-Character design is shallow, each one fighting their own demon and that fight is their only character development through the story pretty much.

Overall, not the best nor the worst in the series but the most recent. If the story was better this could've been something more than just yet another Tales of game.Not that there is anything wrong with that, there's a reason why there have been 17 mainline tales of games so far. But in my opinion this wasn't the game that takes the series to the next step.

While I do like a lot of the things the game has, it just feels weaker in every way after Berseria. It is not a bad game and I do love my fishing mini games. But at full price I can't really recommend this unless you already have the other games or you really really want it.

To those who are heavily invested in story. The story does have its moments and there is a ""payoff"" towards the end. The story as a whole thou feels like it is trying to do too many thing in the limited scope it has. While camping you get quite a lot of conversations with your companions that does give more nuance to the world and your companions. 

To those who are heavily invested in the combat. The combat feels extremely shallow. There are only a few moves that you really need to do and most likely you will end up using just 1 OP move. I really do like the idea of using powerful moves costing health. But that really quickly stops being an issue, especially if you are good at dodging.

To those that want to explore. There is practically 0 of that. It is almost completely one long corridor.

To those that want weapon and/or armor drops. Again none of that. All armors and weapons are either crafted or dropped by a specific boss. No stats variation. This makes pretty much the farming of xp (and skill points) only reason to grind enemies. This again makes the combat feel quite unrewarding. 

TL;DR -  Not as good as Berseria. Bought ultimate at discount (i think -60%). Kinda meh game. Despite its flaws I still did get my moneys worth out of this game. Get it if its on sale.",1692251062,1692251062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Very long story with surprising twists and turns
* Decent fighting system. I say decent because the mechanics presented don't really work the way they're presented. For example, one of your characters is a lady with a shield who you're told will use her shield to stop charging monsters, but when you use that skill, it simply hits the monster and the monster keeps charging.
* Clean and easy to use interface
* Great voice acting and animation. The skill animations were quick but looked nice.

Cons
-----------------------------------
* Graphics are mediocre for such an expensive game
* Accessories are not very useful. I went through the entire game without improving them.

they made the correct choice in having dungeons not be super long, bc zesteria and berseria's dungeons were god awful, but the final dungeon in this game just sucks BAD, and recycles a bunch of non-important bosses as normal battles. which for a jrpg in the 90s or even early 2000s thats fine, but as a triple a 60$ game i cannot stand by that choice at all lol.",1692146828,1692146828,True,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

Game starts at a very slow-pace like the game just opens up on the 15+ hour mark that lets you interact more freely with the systems like being able to shortcut 12 abilities instead of 6 there are SO MANY abilities even at that point in the game that you just wished had more extra slots, furthermore even with that amount of skills a lot become useless as they either doesn't do any damage or the animation is too long, this can be even more inconvenient when you play on hard (which I did since it's my preference) as it locks your character on the animation and get's you open to get hit it very reminds me of Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars.
Story is you know fairly JRPG standard you're chosen one, bunch of strangers come together and power of friendship is OP, the character with the greatest development is Shionne tbh very conflicting character that get's revealed as the story progresses, others are just focusing on what they believe and rectify their motives that one way or another overlap with the goal of Alphen.

The graphics are beautiful, the anime cutscenes are well done, the games mechanics and combat are smoothly polished, the story was a fun ride.

The combat is not turned based and if your familiar at all with the series, you are basically put into a combat arena where you can move freely and hit buttons to issue your different skills of attack, while the other party members are automated. In Smyphonia, the arena was side screen however in this game you have full 3D movement. You also have special attack command thing for each character, when there gauge is full you can have them use there special attack ability but they all have a function, for example if the enemy is casting a astral Art (magic), you can use Rinwells ability to cancel there attack, if the enemy is flying you can use Shionns ability to snipe them out of the air to make it easier to hit, and so on.

After completing the game there is still post content to do, and a handful of side-quests that required I be a higher level I still need to complete, plus you unlock NEW GAME +. The game also has what is called artifices that help make the game easier, and there is a few special ones you want to find before you move on to new game + that allows you to carry over level, money, items, ect over.

If you are a fan of the Tales games or jrpg in general, i recommend this title and honestly the series to check out.

Cons:
1) Forgettable and underdeveloped cast outside of the party members. Even after trying to develop them, the party members are still pretty one note.
2) The 2nd half of the story is a lot less fun than the first and full of info dumps and reskinned enemies.
3) The ending was very unsatisfying to me because the finale boiled down to just [spoiler]using the power of friendship[/spoiler] and they don't have any epilogue for the characters. Also the final story dungeon sucked since it didn't have many checkpoints/shortcuts and was filled up with spongy enemies.
4) The story and character interactions are way too tropey. You can basically predict how most of the story will turn out.
5) The romance needed to be more fleshed out.
6) The majority of side quests are very dull.

A fantastic entry in the Tales series which maintains the staple characteristics of Tales games while exploring new ideas. While not my favorite Tales game, I still thought it was a solid game overall and I look forward to the next one!

[h1]Story[/h1]
I enjoyed the story, although I'm not sure it topped past Tales entries (such as Berseria). The story went in an interesting and somewhat unexpected direction in the second half. While I personally liked it, I can see some people having mixed feelings about it because it has a very different story focus compared to the first half (being vague to avoid spoilers).

The characters had great chemistry and interesting backgrounds. Not my favorite cast (Berseria takes that spot for me) but still a really fun cast that shines through the classic Tales skits. I loved the ""mascot"" of the group, especially for the expressions it has during the various skits. I found the deadpan look in certain skits hilarious given the conversations and couldn't help but notice even when it wasn't the focus of the conversation.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
I thought the gameplay and systems were really well implemented with some caveats. Combat is fluid and the ability to modify practically anything including party in the middle of battle is great (that's not a new feature for Tales games but just pointing it out).

Enemies have what is effectively a stun meter that you can build up through uninterrupted combos and abilities. It makes it quite satisfying when you manage to successfully get the stun off since it relies on the enemy not interrupting the buildup with a successful hit. The one issue I had with this system, however, is that there are a couple of enemies that show up near the end of the game which you cannot build up the stun meter on at all. The cherry on top is that they are incredibly tanky enemies with slow attacks. Hence, fighting them felt like a chore because you just have to keep slowly chipping away at their huge HP with constant attacks while occasionally dodging their slow attacks. There is no weakness to target, so you're effectively just mashing any attack and dodging for a while... Luckily these enemies only showed up in about three different places, so it was only a minor issue.

In terms of equipment, Tales of Arise went for a basic system where you craft weapons with materials and skills are from skill trees (well circles in this case but same idea). It's a standard approach that basically any semi-regular RPG player will be accustomed to. By comparison, Tales of Berseria (the Tales entry prior to this one) went all in on the complexity of its equipment system and acquiring abilities. I don't mind the simplification although it also means that it did not really stand out as a system.

Interestingly, unlike past Tales entries, titles do not really matter. Well, you need to acquire titles to unlock skill trees but the titles themselves do not do anything afterwards. You use all the unlocked abilities across the different titles together.

One other thing that I think is worth praising is that the game does a fantastic job at minimizing grinding and farming even for post-game content. You finish the game around level 60 and simply going through the post-game dungeon naturally levels you up to around 90. Then you can get the last 10 or so levels to reach the level cap within 30-60 minutes by fighting the bonus dungeon final boss (which is not a long battle) 3-4 more times. Beyond that, you get fast travel almost immediately and the fast travel points are plentiful which greatly reduces backtracking by walking. Oh, and you can even find out what places/people have quests available for you from anywhere by looking at your map which I found really nice.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
I thought the graphics looked great! The animated cutscenes were also really well done, although that was expected since they were done by ufotable.

Nothing much to add beyond that. There are monster reskins in the game but the dungeons and environments still felt varied without feeling unnecessarily large and empty (a critique I had with Berseria's dungeons).

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
I enjoyed the soundtrack, although no particular track stood out to me. It definitely had my least favorite opening songs out of any Tales game I have played so far. That is not to say I thought it was bad. However, I remember almost always listening to the opening track when I opened the game for other Tales entries while I consistently skipped it after the first time for Arise.",1690717847,1690717888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite putting the dozens of hours in required to finish the game, I can't shake the feeling that time was spent wading through padding instead of engaging with the game.

Combat should be the one of the highlights of a Tales game. In series tradition, it uses an action RPG combat system where encounters take place in real time, with a large variety of attacks and characters at your disposal. But right off the bat, glaring UI issues rear their ugly heads and drag the experience down. Each character has a unique playstyle and a massive bloated movelist with individual abilities that can be assigned to (at first) three buttons for quick access in combat. This gets expanded to 6 about a third of the way through the game. At first this seems like a valid part of building out a strategy: you distill down the moves you need down to the ones you can immediately access for the next battle encounter. But you can actually swap your equipped artes through a menu, and furthermore that menu allows you to use any arte your character has, just with a slow, clunky, flow-breaking interface. This makes no sense and is annoying, but more in a principled sense than a practical one. Severe balance and design issues end up alleviating this UI issue to an extent.

Enemies have an unreasonable amount of health. Bosses also all have a form of super armor and are generally impervious to hitstun and can't be juggled. Most of your characters' abilities tend to be about forming combos, which just aren't applicable in these encounters. This quickly pushes you to using your most damaging attack, Alphen's Reigning Slash, which does  a massive amount of damage but doesn't interact with the combo system because it's too slow.  What you end up finding is that using this one arte, and occasionally rolling to clear stale move negation, is your dominant strategy, from near the beginning of the game all the way until the end. If you dabble in other characters, the same problem arises. Most of the combat system becomes fluff when you find the most effective arte you can spam ad nauseum, throwing in occasional enemy downs with boost attacks when the situation arises. Every combat encounter becomes very repetitive, which isn't helped by the fact that there's probably about 10 distinct enemy types, with models and animations that get reused from the beginning of the game until the ending. There are some Compile Heart games with more variety, and that is a staggeringly low bar.

The tedium is further reinforced by the story and pacing of the game. There's very typical JRPG story with a very typical JRPG structure of cutscenes, getting from point A to B with battles along the way, and then more cutscenes. The game does a poor job of masking this, and despite what seem like beautiful open fields (marred by terrible draw distance), looking at a map makes it abundantly clear how much the game is very much a giant hallway. At each end of the hallway is a cutscene, followed by two optional skits, which repeat the contents of the cutscene back at you twice. Like everything else, the cutscenes have a problem of just being too long. Or maybe way too much expository dialog and uninspired direction just make it feel that way. I get that a JRPG has to really stretch its animation budget, but there's also a lack of cuts that make any action the cutscenes try to portray fall on its face. It kills tension when characters are in a supposedly urgent situation, maybe with adversaries ten feet away, but are prattling away with full conversations while their would-be murderers politely stand around doing nothing in the background. It's the kind of thing that feels like a holdover from games of yore when dialog was text I could mash through at reading speed instead of sitting through minutes of voiceover.

That voiceover is pretty quality (at least in the native language), but is lent to characters that are again pretty boring and cookie cutter. Characters are likeable enough but fall into tired archetypes and the very slight twists and quirks that the game tries to introduce are clumsily handled and too in your face to be believable. Sprinkles like ""this character is a glutton"" or ""this character likes fishing"" doesn't do much to disguise the shape of the mold.

This may just be recency bias kicking in, but I can't shake the feeling that Tales of Arise is taking a lot of cues from other modern JRPGs that do it better. In particular, Xenoblade. Even if it's not a direct ripoff and most of the commonalities could just be chalked up to ""it's a JRPG,"" some of the suspicious similarities just provoke unfavorable comparisons. What's made clear in those comparisons is that Tales of Arise is missing the mark.",1642868466,1690584377,False,4,0,0.471760332584381104,0,True,False,False

alll in all it feels unfinished and hollow. it had potential but it feels like the developers didn't get enough time to finish the game.
epic attacks that do no damage. you haven't constantly hit area enemies with ridiculous combos that do .5% health dmg. 
a map that doesn't feel grand and like everything is on top of each other.

This review has vague spoilers, you have been warned.

This is more or less another standard Tales game. It's not bad, but it's not amazing either. My experience with the Tales series started with Graces, and then I played Symphonia and Vesperia. After that I paid full price for Zestiria on launch...and decided I was done with Tales games for a long while.


The good:
Tales style combat, has some flaws (covered in the bad) but overall it's solid. 
Good VA (I played in Japanese though, not sure about English VA)
Visually appealing game (it's quite pretty, at least on high graphics settings)
Fun characters
Decent first-half.

The bad:
Game runs out of steam in the second half.
Late-game enemies are gigantic HP sponges.
Enemy exp gets lower as your level goes up, making it hard to grind. 
Characters often act to serve the plot, rather than acting like actual characters.
Story scenes only feel earned about 40% of the time, the other 60% don't put in the work for the payout they try to cash in.
The ending feels rushed. Not like things are moving too quickly rushed, but more like they cut scenes that would have made the game feel more polished. There's at least one moment where they use a quick cut to black instead of actually animating an interesting event.
Optional text dumps to explain key plot points instead of actually explaining via story developments.

Conclusion: Tales of Arise is a decent jrpg. It's defined by the genre, rather than defining the genre. After the dumpster fire that was Zestiria, I'll take it.

I know it's been mentioned plenty of times but the music ranges from middling to generic to bad and while it may sound overstated it's honestly true.

I had high hopes for this new entry and while it's very pretty and fun to play story-wise I'd say it's one of the worst stories they've given us.

It is great to see the Tales series finally being given a better budget to help realize an improved quality overall.


[h1]COMBAT: 9/10[/h1]
Combat in [i]Arise[/i] takes on some concepts from [i]Tales of Berseria[/i], with free-run movement through the battlefield and Artes usage being tied to small ""nodes"" called AG (Artes Gauge), which replenish over-time or when characters perform specific actions.

Each character has their own perks and capabilities to engage different types of enemies. There is the all-rounder, the healer, the one who can take on armored enemies, the tank, so on. While you're still limited to a 4-man party like in the previous games, all characters take part in the battle as the ones in the reserve can be briefly summoned to do their Boost Attacks, which can have certain effects depending on the type of enemy you're fighting.

There are also these finisher moves called Boost Strikes, that become available after you hit enemies consecutively, building up a blue gauge around their target. These attacks kill enemies instantly and increase your battle points earned, which in turn reward more XP and SP (Skill Points) multiplier.

Overall, combat feels good and responsive, although I wish they had implemented some frame cancel mechanics (such as dodge cancel). Hitting enemies with Boost Strikes never feel old as it is quite the spectacle to watch.


[h1]ART DIRECTION, DESIGN AND MUSIC: 10/10[/h1]
The art direction is absolutely fantastic. With the Tales series finally stepping their game with a better engine, the team went crazy with environments and textures, with everything having this ""watercolor"" feeling to it.

Also, characters a wide range of emotions and expressions which are fitting to the anime aesthetics. Minoru Iwamoto returns once again as the lead character design, with all characters feeling unique and distinct.

The soundtrack is stellar, as you'd expect from the legendary Motoi Sakuraba. There are even some remixes from past Tales series that add that extra flavor of nostalgia. He really got out of his comfort zone and composed some unique pieces while still retaining his signature style.

The graphic design part is also great, with a very clean and sleek UI in the both the menus and combat. Very minimalist and doesn't get in the way of the action.


[h1]STORY: 7/10[/h1]
The story falls a bit flat on its back initially due to some typical tropes used and the linearity of narrative: go to point A to B, fight the big bad boss, get the MacGuffin. There are some twists here and there, but nothing great.

However, later in the game the story starts to unfold with some big reveals, as you'd expect from the typical Tales game. The ending is incredibly fulfilling and wholesome.

The heart of the story lies in the characters themselves and their interactions in the skits (which are now fully animated as opposed to moving portraits). The main cast manages to be diverse and very memorable in terms of personality.

Overall, the story is great but takes way too long to really kick in, but this is saved by the characters, who are very well developed.


[h1]OVERALL GAMEPLAY: 8/10[/h1]
The game tries to be a ""semi-open world"" with vast areas to explore, where you can fight enemies and collect items, such as plants, fish and ore. Despite having these open areas, the game is incredibly linear; think [i]Final Fantasy XII[/i].

Enemies no longer drop Gald (the in-game currency), but instead materials that are used for crafting, and there are some few ""trash"" items whose only function is to be sold for Gald. Fishing and mining ores also provides those ""trash items"", which results in a decent source of income. Sidequests often provide larger chunks of Gald, as well SP.

Speaking of sidequests, there are A LOT of them. They're quite simple in nature, with many being bounty hunting (go to the point marked in the map and kill the enemy), while others require you to bring specific materials to the NPC. Nothing groundbreaking, but at least this time you can track sidequests and they're shown avaliable on the map, as opposed to older titles where sidequests were elusive, timed and very easy to miss.


[h1]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h1]

- You can now fast travel at pretty much any time you want (unless you're in a specific story point that prevents you from doing so).

- You can use unlocked weapons as skins. Additionally, you can also save ""costume sets"".

- Shop NPCs are now conveniently found in the same place, at the Inn. You have a blacksmith, a accessory crafter, an item seller and the innkeeper themselves (sleeping no longer costs Gald, by the way).

- You can find campires around the world which are used to rest and cook. A traveler NPC will be right next to it, and provide services for items and crafting.

- Cook has been simplified and you no longer need to ""level up recipes"" to increase their effect. Instead, foods now have ""favorite"" characters tied to it, and have different extra effects depending on who is cooking (such as increased duration or a stronger effect). You can only cook at campfires or Inns, though.

- Everything gets tracked, and there are very few missables, unlike past titles. You can play this game perfectly fine without a guide.


[h1]THE BAD AND THE UGLY[/h1]
The most heated topic are the costly DLC costumes. The Tales series has always been one where you unlock costumes through side-quests, but this one has plenty of costumes that are exclusively paid DLC. The worst part of it is that each costume also unlocks a title, and titles in this game are tied to skill trees where you unlock new passives and abilities for the characters. This means you can only 100% the game by cashing in for the costumes, and for me this is absolutely unforgivable.

The game is absurdly linear, especially dungeons. The fact there is no longer a world map like in older titles kinda kills that sense of wonder and exploration. This was already a problem in [i]Berseria[/i], and is as bad in this title too.

Another massive problem this game has is recycling enemies. There are pretty much a dozen types of enemies and you encounter their ""reskins"" in all zones. All the same wolf, bird, armadillo and whatnot. The Tales series always had enemy reskins, but not this extent. Really disappointing.

While the combat is amazing, it has some glaring flaws:
- The field of view (FoV) is absurdly small. The camera centers on the character and it becomes really hard to see enemies around you, so it is very common to be hit from something offscreen that you can't really predict (like those armadillos' rolling attacks or the wolves' pounce). The fact there is no option to increase the FoV makes this even worse.
- Cluttering effects. Sometimes it becomes downright impossible to see what is happening on screen because of the many effects from Artes, especially magic. This becomes very annoying when fight human-sized enemies, who are small and it's hard to see what they're doing.
- Most enemies are damage sponges, even on Normal difficulty.

[i]Arise[/i] also ditches multiplayer, which has always been a staple of the series, as a second player could pick up the controller and play with one of the characters during combat.


[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]
[i]Tales of Arise[/i] is arguably the best game in the series from a technical standpoint and combat, but falls flat on its back due to linearity, limited exploration, repetitive damage sponge enemies and DLC barring gameplay content.

I still greatly recommend this game specially if you're a fan of the series, as there are plenty of easter eggs and satisfying character interactions.

I hope, however, that for future titles Bandai Namco decides to not be as greedy as they were here with DLC, and give the developers an even larger budget to develop an even more complete experience.",1633392287,1689816485,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

As someone who has watched a bit of anime but wouldn't consider themselves a huge fan, the plot and characters felt fairly fresh. The setting and plot are highly reminiscent of some of my favorite childhood JRPG titles (FF4 and FF6 most particularly), but I didn't find any of the story developments to be overly predictable. One potential downside, in fact, is that the significant ""twists"" in the story, while fine and plausible, generally come without any noteworthy foreshadowing, making those moments less ""ah-ha""and more ""oh, ok.""

In terms of game mechanics, the (almost) save anywhere, teleport anywhere system feels modern and generous. The map UI is simple but serviceable. The environments are sufficiently varied and consistently beautiful, including just enough verticality in the outdoor regions to keep things interesting without becoming confusing. These environments branch just enough to avoid feeling like hallways, without permitting the player to stumble into areas they're not ready for. The dungeon environments, on the other hand, are almost entirely linear, diverging only in small sections for optional loot.

Other reviews allude to the ""power of friendship"" style dialog, which does become overbearing occasionally, particularly in the final act. Regardless, I was pleased to find the characters actually have interpersonal conflicts and go through some fairly believable character development. The sheer abundance of fully voiced dialog in a variety of formats (from occasional full anime to in-engine cut scenes to manga strips to simple voice overs) rarely feels excessive, though they get repetitive in a few places. The main downsides are the non-voiced side quest dialog (which is entirely skippable) and much of the cooking scenes/dialog (which often merit an eye roll).

Some reviews make mention of required grinding, but that seems either to be limited to harder difficulties or to have been addressed by recent updates or DLC. By simply fighting through every natural encounter in pursuit of main story and the side quest objectives, I never felt under-leveled for an area or boss fight.

The range of gameplay difficulty and character control (from very hands-off to completely hands-on) make for some reasonably customizable and thus very enjoyable combat. The abundance of mechanics are introduced slowly with seamless tutorials over the first 20 levels, so one never feels overwhelmed. The use of a single party mana pool provides some much-appreciated simplicity given the sheer number of spells and abilities.

I don't recall encountering a single bug or glitch in 50 hours of gameplay. I believe I remember seeing a few subtitle typos and mismatches with the voiced dialog, but overall everything felt exceptionally well-polished.

All in all, a big thumbs up for the experience as a whole.",1688855431,1689736104,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Characters are good-looking and their story is above average. Fights are engaging in a way that you can choose either brute force if you're casually playing or spend more time on planning the upcoming fights, I like the pacing.

One of few gripes is that this game doesn't support any special screen ratios which is kinda disturbing since my main display is 21:9 wide and steam deck uses 16:10 screen. The black bars kinda ruins the immersion.

To the other devs that sees this TAKE NOTES:
This game has the best SKIPPING function that I've experienced! You can rush the story while listening to the whole work of a VA. Please make this a standard feature for story driven games!

So far so good, this game is essentially if you combined an action MMORPG game with an anime. The controls are fluid, there are many different attacks and combos to use. The lore is quite interesting as you start off as a slave with no enemy etc. The characters are also different having their own unique personalities which is a plus. I have not checked the english VA but the japanese VA was done quite well.

You'll be going around in a linear open world environment fighting enemies, collecting things, completing objectives/storylines etc. If you have ever played an action based MMORPG like Tera before then you kind of already know what you are getting. I would highly recommend playing this with a controller though as with most games that focus around precisely moving, dodging attacks, and being relatively fast paced, you should definitely use a controller for that. It's pretty good overall and I definitely recommend giving this a shot if you like action based MMORPGs and/or anime styled themes.

-The visuals everyone are praising are good compared to older Tales, but mediocre compared to almost any other game.

-Enemies are damage-sponges. Fighting feels like a chore, what's the point of doing cool artes and combos if they end up damaging a MOTHERFUCKING SLUG for 0.01% of its max HP ? No matter how cool you look, you feel weak.

-You get absolutely 0 FREEDOM, it's far beyond being linear, the game feels like more like a movie with farming in-between cutscenes, except farming isn't fun : 

         -> You can't visit neighbouring zones until the games tells you it's time to.
         -> You can't ""build"" any character, the game tells you ""This is the next weapon you need to buy"" because, well it's the 
              only option  anyway. And the next Big Monster you find will give you the materials to craft it. FUN ! 
         -> This is a classic for such games, but you can't make any decisions. Here, however, it really feels like you're just 
              farming in-between cutscenes. It's more like a bland, generic interactive anime than a video game.

-The plot is mediocre, I don't mind generic but it's just poorly-executed. You're a slave, and you're fighting to free other slaves... OK, cool ! Except the game does nothing to shape their pain and suffering, everything feels rushed, you can't emphatize with anyone and it's just very hard to care.

-The world-building is utter dogshit. I'm not kidding. You leave the first ""country"" only to reach the neighbouring one. You enter ""Small Village 243"" which is the literal name of the village, yes. And Small Village 243 which is the one nearest the border is ALSO exactly 2 short areas away from the Capital City !! It feels like 500 meters, give or take. Where are the 240 other small villages ? Where are the larger villages and cities... WHY DOES THE CAPITAL CITY HAVE A GRAND TOTAL OF 3 STREETS AND LIKE 400 CITIZENS ? Of which you see about 30 as NPC.

[hr][/hr]

When I first booted up [i]Tales of Arise[/i], I knew I was in for something special. The minute the anime-style opening started playing, a smile came unbidden to my face, and the game did not disappoint at all. For some context, I've never played a [i]Tales[/i] game before this one. My experience with JRPGs up to this point has been limited to three of the [i]Final Fantasy[/i] games (X, XIII, and XV), and I've never been a big fan of the flashy ""style over substance"" approach that many Japanese action RPGs take to combat gameplay. 

However, this game is honestly one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing, and by the time I've finished writing this review, I hope to lay down why this is a game that you deserve to play. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

The basic gameplay loop of this game can be split into two distinct parts. The first and most prominent is the combat encounters, which I spent around nine hours of my 53 hour playthrough fighting through. Encounters allow you to control one of the six main characters (who you can switch between during combat), with three other characters actively fighting beside you under AI control. 

The other two are relegated to the backbench, where they do not actively fight with you, but can be briefly summoned to use their special ability to counter enemy attacks. They will also appear to carry out finisher animations on staggered enemies, but will always disappear unless part of the active roster. The AI is competent, and does not require much (if any) babysitting. They will loosely follow a set strategy during combat, and can be relied on to intelligently deal with threats during combat.

The combat in this game is fine, although I do have to criticise the overly chaotic visual language during combat. Overused and overactive particle effects make actually comprehending what is going on during larger skirmishes difficult, and often your controlled character will be hard to discerd due to large enemy character models and a poorly designed third-person camera. Furthermore, due to the way your party's special attacks work (pretty much all of them will counter a specific type of attack), all but one of the special abilities are difficult to actually use. 

For example, Shionne's special attack is a powerful beam attack that can knock airborne enemies out of the air and stun them. Cool. The issue is that I don't know what the game considers to be a flying enemy. I often ran into situations where the enemies [i]looked[/i] like they were airborne, but the game didn't treat it as such for some arbitrary reason that was not adequately communicated by the UI. 

The only exception to this rule is Rinwell's ability, which has a specific UI prompt that effectively communicates when you need to use her magic-cancelling ability. Law's armour shattering attack is hard to use because the game doesn't communicate what enemies actually have armour very well, Kisara's shield attack is hard to use because I was never quite able to lock onto a charging enemy while they were charging, and Dohalim's vine attack didn't work half the time because I wasn't told what constituted an agile foe.

 Even the voice lines that play when an attack should be used are near useless because the window for some of these counters is so small that by the time the voice line played, the attack was already over. It's frustrating, but I never died because of this, and it's a minor quibble with a punchy and functional combat system. 

The other half of gameplay is exploration and resource management, and this is far more plain than combat. Most levels are linear, with each region having a central hub or two with a city area inbetween, and branching areas coming off from those hubs. These levels are reasonably well designed, with plenty of hidden goodies and good enemy placements that don't feel cheap (for the most part). The only level I actually got super frustrated with was the final dungeon, where you will be funnelled into miniboss encounter after miniboss encounter with very little rewards outside of endgame crafting materials for weapons. 

Characters also have special abilities that can be used to open up locked areas of the map, but these are infrequently used, and also cost CP, the resource you use for healing in combat. This design choice is understandable, but CP costs for these locked areas also increase as you go through the game, and will sometimes outpace your increasing CP pool's expansion rate. Another nice feature is the ability to switch the party leader outside of combat, which has no gameplay variance, but allows you to run around as Shionne or another party member instead of the default. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]VFX/SFX/Visuals:[/h1] 

[i]Tales of Arise[/i] is surprisingly easy on graphics requirements, which I guess is down to the easy-to-render anime artstyle. Art design runs between fantastic (Elde Menancia, comes to mind) and ""Generic JRPG art"" (Calaglia), with standout elements being the character design and the monster design. The real standouts are the anime cutscenes done by Ufotable, the studio behind the anime [i]Fate/Stay Night [Unlimited Blade Works][/i]. These cutscenes absolutely sold the game for me, along with the fantastic OST and sound design. VFX are a mixed bag, but are mostly solid outside of the overactive particle effects during combat. Not much to say here, but fantastic all around.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Technical aspects:[/h1]

The game didn't run flawlessly on my (admittedly low-end) hardware, but it ran fine outside of some frame drops. Keep in mind that I have a absolute potato, and that literally anything better than what I have will run this game far better (presumably). However, I do have to say that it ran better than expected, as I usually can't run anything made post-2016 on my measly Intel i5-10210U with 8GB RAM and Nvidia MX250 with 2GB VRAM. I could run this game on medium settings with an average framerate of around 20-40 FPS, with frequent drops into single digit frames in intensely detailed areas or big fights. 

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

Overall, [i]Tales of Arise[/i] is a fantastic RPG with one of the most deeply moving and character-driven stories I've ever experienced. While having some minor design decisions that might be called into question, it makes up for it with fantastic production value, an amazing visual and audible landscape, and some of the best music I've ever heard out of a game. Well worth both your time and money, 10/10.",1688954381,1688954381,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Great game that packs a lot of content & totally worth it even if you don't get it on sale. Couldn't recommend it enough.
Here's a brief summary of my experience.

Story - 8/10 (Good)
Good Solid story nothing ground breaking but still manage to get me curious on what's happening next

Graphics & Visuals - 9.5/10 (Great)
Almost a perfect score for me but, I'll drop 0.5 points due to some noticeable pop ups when you teleport in into areas. 

Characters/Party Members & Interactions  - 10/10 (Perfect)
Very likeable characters & I got invested in them from the beginning. Their banters especially during exploration are very well done and enjoyable to listen to. Every character have interesting background to them as you get to know them the further you progress into the game. Job well done.

Combat - 10/10 (Perfect)
Combat is great & very fluid. While I mostly played as Alphen (I prefer melee approach), I really like the fluidity of the artes system & the amount of control you have of your entire party members. Everybody has a purpose & you can customize/ switch characters in combat. It's absolutely necessary to utilize all combat mechanics in higher difficulty as most elite enemies could easily 1 - 2 shot you. I also love the fact that the game is not very hand holdy in terms of advance combat system. So you have to discover & learn them by yourselves.

Enemies, Encounters & Difficulties - 8/10 (Good)
Overall enemy designs are enjoyable. The highlight for me are definitely the Gigant hunts & the main bosses as their designs are cool & they require you to react accordingly with the combat combat mechanics. I would like to see improvements to the regular enemies though in the next installment. Personally in my opinion, there are quite a lot of reused model as most basic enemy types are reused with just a slight variation in later areas so I feel like I've seen all of the same base enemy types starting from the mid-end of the game. Although they do mixed in some gigants in there so it's not too bad.

Sound & Music - 9/10 (Great)
SFX sounds great & very helpful during combat for sound queues. Music are also very good especially the final ost in the ending.",1688923097,1688923097,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The reason, as simply as possible, is the combat system is downright stupid. There is no mechanic by which you can focus-fire. Your allies all have different logic and seem to go out of their way to target someone other than your target. This is particularly frustrating because the mechanic by which you charge up an ultra ability, which is particularly effective for damage output, strongly relies on your team collectively focusing on a target. And as this meter seems to be very reluctant to fill until an enemy is low on hp, or worse with bosses only at set points (50% and 0% really), it becomes more and more useless. This leaves a combat system that is incoherent and very frustrating, and while I despise the frustrating nature of this combat, I have a personality that requires I finish this game. Needless to say, I would not recommend it. Unless you change the setting to the easiest setting just so that combat becomes an irrelevant barrier to your consumption of the narrative, in which case I would say it's just fine - not great.

EDIT UPON COMPLETION:
This game has a satisfying story. Beautiful even. The characters are diverse, have continuity, and show growth. The world makes sense and so do the side quests, allowing for a broadly immersive experience. 

That said, I still can't get past the issues I have with the combat. I can't say it got better. I did only play as the starting character in combat despite you having a handful of other options, but that isn't the crux of the combat issue and I stand by hating it enough to not recommend this game. For those who don't care about the combat or go so far as to just play on easy and skip thew hole nonsense, it can be a satisfying game. There are some mechanics that are generally fluff and wasteful in my opinion and don't add too much to the game - that being the cooking, fishing, and by extension much of the gathering.",1687640329,1688858626,False,3,0,0.528910219669342041,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise is the first in the Tales series that I've played and it is really fun. The story is nice and the characters are likeable, even though they are quite one-note. The gameplay is also great but it does get hard to keep track of what's going on with all the explosions onscreen. But what this game does best is that it doesn't have the insane grinding that most JRPGs are filled with. Crafting materials are just straight up given to you before reaching a boss fight and you'll get enough XP to do the post game side quests right after finishing the story.

On the other hand, what sucks incredibly is that the Relief Support Pack DLC is pretty much compulsory to get if you wanna play the game on harder difficulties. The game by default limits you to only 15 of each healing item and the DLC raises that to 99. And the DLC isn't included in the deluxe or ultimate editions.

It does nothing particularly bad, but at the same time it also just doesn't do anything particularly well either.
It is one of those games that you just complete and move on.
None of the characters, heroes or villains, really stand out. Most are functional but incredibly bland.
The story follows a similar pattern with many of the same beats we have seen before, just it is lacking that distinct Tales flair of picking familiar tropes apart, just playing them straight instead. It starts quite promising, but then just loses steam and becomes a villain of the week setup that remains until the end with every arc just being an over and done deal once completed.

The combat is serviceable with smother controls than before, but suffers from some very spongy enemies and bosses making fights drag something fierce.
The graphics however are generally great and this marks the best the series has looked. But sadly that is the only point I can say is a full positive and not without any caveats. The rest feels like it is just there.

In general, this game feels like one of those that are just ""painfully average"". It does its job, but nothing more.

Also removed the decision making of equipment that was present in every other title other than a minor buff to specific attack types that is easily ruled out of use
And with most boss fights turning into grind fests just to beat them thanks to gank machanics.
But now, a detailed break down on each of the party members (that I can remember):

Alphen - No memory, no pain, weapons bring me joy, basic gag is ""I like spicy stuff""
Shionne - hates other due to wanting something from her, brings pain to any that touch her (except Alphen), fashion girl, is a also foodie
Rinwell - persecuted witch, racist against oppressors (including Shionne [for most of the game]), also save the owls (her only reliable friend)

740130,100815070,76561198349791894,93,4,4233,0,2749,1692349738,"I made a review a while back where I talked about the improvements and downgrades in this game compared to other titles in the series. While I initially gave it a positive review, as I played more, the downgrades become a lot more noticeable to the point of me just having to drop this game partway through.

Some improvements compared to prior titles:
- Huge leap forward in graphics (Very noticeable change between Berseria and Arise graphics)
- Combat is a lot more flashy and cinematic 
- World traversing feels a lot smoother (running is a base feature and motion isn't super stiff)
- Fields and towns are a lot more diverse and open (Older titles have a lot of nearly identical towns and fields)
- Dungeons are a little less linear (not much of an improvement, but noticeable)
- Skits had a complete design overhaul (2D pictures to animated 3D models in a comic like format). It's different, but feels better to me
- Combat system received another big overhaul compared to prior games and arte combos are a lot more streamlined which make the game more accessible to newcomers

The downgrades:
- The characters feel a lot more anime and edgy compared to the goofy, but charming casts in prior games
- 6/12 artes compared to 8/16 in older games is a bit restrictive
- As there is no more MP like system for artes usage, healing is now limited by a new meter called CP. This drains really fast as party members die a lot, and it only restores in towns or by item usage.
- Item scarcity; Healing items are extremely expensive and you don't get much gald as you play which makes the CP system even worse.
- Story falls off a bit as you go on
- Low enemy variety (lots of reskinned enemies with buffed stats later)

The biggest downgrade is the boss design. Arise's design was heavily inspired by FromSoftware games (Dark Souls), and this made the boss design really take a blow. 
Bosses have permanent superarmor meaning they are COMPLETELY IMMUNE TO STAGGER and all the cool combos you learned from smaller enemies is thrown out the window. Your only method of ""comboing"" is downing them through boost strikes (long cooldown situational skills) and cutscene attacks (occurs ever 25% dealt to boss). Even when you down the enemy only stops attacking and they still don't stagger, so you can't really combo bosses. This changes the game from a combo heavy game to a more hit and run game which isn't what tales is known for. 
It doesn't help either that
A) A lot of artes have long animations that can't be cancelled severely limiting your options
B) Bosses basically 1 shot you which is nothing new, but CP healing restrictions and item scarcity really makes you feel the burn
C) Bosses have massive healthpools. Since you can't efficiently combo bosses and bosses can straight up one shot you, bosses take forever and are a real drag.

Conclusion:
Arise takes a huge step forward in it's visuals and combat system, but it's really held back by the horrid boss design which invalidates almost all combat mechanics making this game a real drag to play through. If you want to experience a true tales game, look at previous titles such as Vesperia, Xillia, Graces, or Berseria where you'll find a much more lovable cast and enjoyable bosses. If you still want to buy Arise, I suggest you wait for a price drop or a sale.",1633830907,1688278125,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not a huge fan of JRPGs in general, but there are just a few JRPGs that I do like. That being said, I'm reviewing this game mostly as a standalone game. I played it entirely in Japanese.

[u][b]The good:[/b][/u]
- The graphics are VERY pretty.
- Game difficulty is mostly well-balanced throughout, at least with the way that I progressed through the game. For the most part, I did just the side quests that are easy to do, and that was usually enough to buy better gear. XP gains are alright I suppose, and using it to unlock skills felt decently rewarding.
- Exploration is rewarding.
- Not too much backtracking, though there still is some.
- It's pretty well optimized. Ran on my RX 5700 XT at 4K, at around and often more than 60 FPS throughout the game. Played it on Linux through Proton without any significant issues, too.

[u][b]The bad:[/b][/u]
- Typical JRPG tropes. Some people might like them, but I personally find them a bit annoying.
- Some parts of the story, especially those which I didn't really care about, dragged on for a little too long.
- The game mechanics weren't anything particularly refreshing.
- In-game DLC promos are annoying. Nobody should need a DLC button at a campfire; it breaks the atmosphere and immersion, and discourages me from even going to a campfire. It's especially annoying with how much I paid for the game already. (The game is priced at 8,778 JPY in Japan; according to SteamDB as of writing this review, that's 73.63 USD, which is 22.74% higher than the US Steam price of 59.99 USD.)
- [b]The party battle AI is dumb.[/b] Probably the biggest, most frustrating gripe I had with this game. Often I thought ""DON'T JUST STAND THERE AS YOU GET ATTACKED."" I tried adjusting the strategy to make party members keep their distance, but it didn't do much.

It's not like I [i]hate[/i] the game. As stated above, it does have some pretty good features, and I did enjoy some parts of it. However, it also has some very unfortunate downsides as a video game which I think [i]must[/i] be improved upon, especially with its price tag (at least as of now in Japan), and that led me to not recommend it. It certainly isn't for everybody, but I can see why some people would like it.

I think my biggest gripe is that Boss fights just are not fun. They had all the tools to make them cinematic, cool, and engaging with the d-pad of calling in allies to do something to interrupt enemies and then juggling them. You CANNOT do that with bosses. They are 100% uninterruptible with their actions (unless they are casting an arte) so you could be doing a cool interaction/combo that works on all the fodder up until the boss. Boss enters and just powers through interrupting you with every attack they make, while you just have no real interaction with them unless it's a scripted part of the fight. There are also large monsters that are sometimes boss and sometimes not. They act the exact same as a boss, even if they have a breakable part which stops them for maybe 2 seconds depending on the monster

Story overall also just drops in quality, and it took a nosedive for me after getting your whole party assembled. It felt like they just wanted this huge story that may have just been better to split into two games. The final boss of ""Part 1"" felt like a great spot to potentially end the story but they just rushed through it all to say ""Yeah uhhhh slavery is bad"" without really going through each of the initial zones to show a more grassroots or some other more nuanced approach. Because they do in the aftermath of it all ask themselves ""What can we do now?"" but then within literally the next 30 mins a world ending threat with no real build up at all to it happens. I put the game down here because I just wasn't having fun anymore on both fronts. 

TL;DR Cant interact with bosses like you can other enemies so you are at their whimsy, story just rushed through its selling point *for me* and hand waves it off to deal with the next threat.

The tales' series is known for its interesting combat formula where you have basic attacks to spam and weave in special moves to hold combos. Alternatively, you can swap off to one of the 6 party members with their own movesets and combos. You even have ultimate combo attacks between all the party members that you spam. The combat was extremely fun and kept me hooked....for the first nine to ten hours. After that, it felt very repetitive, regardless of swapping out different combos, playing as different characters. Some of the bosses in the middle to late game have insane amounts of HP. Granted, there's a stagger bar to alleviate the need to constantly dodge and read their mechanics for what seems to be an hour. 

Once you hit that halfway point, the game's rpg mechanics begin to weaken. There's less point to gearing out your characters for specific stats, you just want to pick what's strong against THIS specific set of enemies. Granted, there's a lot of stat items to be used, I'm talking in the thousands for you to pick up throughout the game. The boss mechanics are really fun to dodge or interrupt, but most of the time you have to die to them to even understand how to negate it while also resetting your gear to be attuned against their elements. 

If you like grinding in JRPGs, you will love this game.  Personally, I hated it. Some of the bosses are insanely tanky and require the sufficient stats and skills to even breakthrough their mechanics. In the late game, at around 60 hours, the enemies begin one shotting you with any of their moves if not properly kitted. So, you either spend hours upon hours grinding EXP from previous enemies, or you spend all of your currency on recovery items to constantly resurrect party members. 

The skill tree system is really fun, you have a ton of freedom in choosing which skills you want and what stats you want to specialize in. It's a great addition to the tales' series formula that should be kept for more variety in the future. 

The party members are really fun to play as. My small gripe is that the party would've greatly benefited from just having some sort of priest or healer that could pump out healing. Most of the time you're either buying thousands of recovery items or stuck with having the one or two party members that have weaker healing spells, but also drastically weaker dps as well.

In terms of visuals and audio, the game looks really nice for anime graphics. The particle effects seem a little out of place to me sometimes since they're borderline realistic. Characters and enemies are drawn very detailed, but some of the enemy designs sort of lose their flair. Many bosses end up reusing assets in the later part of the game, with a different color palette. The audio is crisp and many of the effects happening during battle really convey the impact of each hit. 

For story and characters, the game was a little dull around 3/4ths of the way through. The story dumbs down to anime amnesiac goes on a journey to stop slavery and discrimination. The main character is really generic, he's positive and outgoing at every turn, always trying to help and save everyone. He becomes darker once he recovers his memories, but by then the conflict and turmoil he would've face gets resolved by the power of friendship anyways. I prefer Yuri's character from Tales of Vesperia more, but to each their own. Every other character in the party is more interesting and the dynamic between each of them and the main character is exponentially better. The villains are okay, they have their reasons for being evil so its not laughably bad. There are some of them that fall into the category of ""I'm a higher being that's ascended, you should bow down and worship me"" and are very plain, emotionless and boring. 

I was moreso a fan of the little interactions between the characters during combat and the camping portions of the game. The main cast made me wince more than twice everytime a cutscene happened. The game cannot stop reminding you that anime discrimination and slavery is bad, the characters never stop shoving it in your face. Scenes were solemn silence would've been perfect or breaking up the tension with a funny joke are instead replaced with unnecessarily complicated exposition about anime slavery and how bad it is. There's no cutscenes with the characters having friendly banter or cute sidetalks. There are no other side characters, the only side character in this game is anime slavery. 

I finished the game because I was already more than halfway through, but I dropped the game and picked it back up 4-5 times because of how badly the story drags and how irritating some of the scenes are. The combat was fun to experiment with, the skill trees were really fun to play around with, the customization options allow you to reoutfit your partys' color palettes. The writing for the story and characters are really mediocre and make you feel uninterested most of the runtime. I personally recommend tales of vesperia or berseria if you want a more interesting story and characters. This game is only worth the price on a deep sale of like 15 to 20 bucks. 

P.S. The fact that you can buy levels and skillpoints with real money in a singleplayer game just baffles the mind to me. Big shit move from Namco, but well, it's a singleplayer game so people are free to do what they want with their own money.",1660839812,1687827025,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise focuses more on its combat, which would be fun if the enemies weren't such HP sponges, I admit it can be satisfying to pull off combos and do special moves by maintaining your streak, but the novelty wears off rather quickly.

One of the main issues I have with this game is just the lack of content compared to previous titles, take a look at vanilla Vesperia, there's a huge overworld to explore, tons and tons of sidequests, optional extras, and secrets, not to mention the wide variety of weapons and gear you can synth to learn new skills. Well, here comes Arise to get rid of all of that; with its terrible, boring sidequests that's pretty much just ""go here and do the thing"". Equipment upgrading is pretty much linear, a new weapon will appear in the shop, and it will be better than the last weapon you brought, no decision making, no stat-building, just a very bare bones upgrade system for your accessories, like I said, a very streamlined and watered down experience.

Not recommended if you enjoy the series for its large amount of activities, and decision-making when it comes to upgrades. 3/10",1687814346,1687814346,False,97,4,0.616891443729400635,0,True,False,False

Graphics:
+The best graphics in the series and one of the best for anime-style graphics in gaming period. Looks especially clean in 1440 and 4k and this Tales Port can actually get 60 FPS.
-The game was specifically designed for PS4 so I felt some of those limitations. Things such as excessive pop-in, some muddy textures, and bottle-necked segments that are waiting for the ""PS4"" to load something my PC loaded 2 mins ago. The graphics setting can also be a bit finicky. Mine kept going back to 720p and I had to look up fix online to get it to stay in 4K. I play games on Switch so I wasn't too upset with graphical shortcomings, but I definitely was expecting a bit more on PC, at least with the pop-ins. 

Music and Sound:
+Some music is excellent, fitting, and moving. Sound direction is very good and I liked all the English Voice Actors (I'm a huge fanboy for Shionne's voice actor). Shame they get so little credit in game. The credits PLASTERS the Japanese VA's in multiple places (no hate, they deserve it), but relegates the English VA's to some fine-print corner of the credits. All voice actors from other regions deserve more love. I genuinely appreciate how Xenoblade 3 handled this. You can go into the menu at any time and see who voices any of the main/secondary cast.  
-Some music is practically grating. I appreciated the good songs, but I expected a bit more consistency from the guy who composed for Dark Souls, other Tales games, and the Baiten Kaitos games (his best work IMO).

Story and Characters:
+The story has some good themes, dialogue, and genuinely likable characters--Big Bro Bucket Head, Thorny Waifu, little sis who deserves infinite headpats, Big-sis tight pants, Mr. FABULOUS (just look at that hair!), and possibly the most ABSOLUTELY LOVABLE mascot character (he's so FLUFFY). Oh and there's...
-...Law. He whines, he preaches, he womanizes, he gets people killed, he's a hypocrite and he ruins almost every scene he's in. And the game acts like he deserves a s-tier waifu for just existing...it's insulting (his VA does a good job though). Personal bias aside, there are some inconsistent messages, cringey dialogue, generic side characters, and mediocre world building that other Tales games have done better (such as Symphonia or Abyss). I always felt like I was racing through areas without really getting to know them, which made the world feel kind of disconnected and more hollow than it should have. I'm saving the world, but do I really even know it? Text also has a surprising amount of typos, to the point it got distracting. 

Gameplay:
+Excellent core battle system that is likely the best in the series. It fixes the slow AP gain of Beseria by having it regenerate quickly to keep doing more moves. It offsets this by giving enemies more HP, but allowing you to ""BREAK"" them which can lead to instant-kill moves if you combo enough directly afterwards. This feels very satisfying, especially when combined with the genuinely unique play styles between characters. Arise is probably the most like a dungeon crawler out of any games in the series (that I've played). This mostly works well as dungeons are decent, but it's a shame we don't see the same thoughtful puzzles like we had back in Symphonia and Abyss--it's mostly just fight monsters, push switch, fight monsters, boss. Still, at least the dungeons are nowhere near as sloggy as SMT/Persona (I'll die on this hill, Atlus doesn't do fun dungeons). Fast travel and sidequest tracking are done right, which is a relief. 
-DLC, DLC, D, L, C. Why must you do this Bamco? You're cheapening your games by offering $150+ of DLC to a single player game. I get devs need more money, but there are more genuine ways to do it. Xenoblade 3 got it right again (probably the only JRPG lately that has) with a full $30 DLC collection that came with an EXCELLENT extra story that was developed after the main game. The DLC here is just content gutted and held hostage. I miss the days when characters had 6+ extra unique costumes in game as part of sidequests. It's mostly DLC now (in-game ones are mostly just palette swaps and generic, shared ones) and to make things worse there are also micro-transactions for things like money and XP. You want to know what this game is stingy with? C'mon, guess! Yeah, money and XP. I played on normal and my money was always stretched thin (items are WAY more expensive than in previous games) and if you skip too many battles bosses are going to be a slog. If you play above normal you'd need the DLC unless you wanted to grind like a buffoon. It's annoying the game is essentially encouraging you to use the DLC to make the experience more enjoyable. Aside from the DLC abomination the game feels a bit too linear for it's own good, especially in overworld maps. The game needed more room to breath and flesh out the world. Also, as good as the break system is, there are a few enemies that are immune to it, which leads to some overly long, bullet sponge battles. Not many, but worth mentioning. 

Overall I enjoyed Arise and the overall experience of modern Tales games does appear to be improving. I just hope they can tighten up some of the experience to finally return to the golden era of Tales games.",1687769473,1687807829,True,1,0,0.501538455486297607,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise does a stunning visual overhaul where darlings will embark on a standalone adventure following the intertwined paths of Alphen and Shionne. The combat has undergone a notable change, embracing a more action-oriented approach with a full range of motion and dynamic dodging. The character developments are presented in the familiar form of skits that don't feel too cliché nor forced.

Onee-chan is most impressed with the environment design, having spent hours in photo mode in the gorgeous blend of elven fantasy and sci-fi environments. There is no small amount of side activities that further immerse darlings into this rich watercolor-inspired world. Featuring a story that unfolds in a conflict-ridden universe, delving into themes of oppression, suffering, and revolution, Tales of Arise is a great starting point for darlings seeking an epic RPG adventure.",1666595068,1687714669,True,11,2,0.645973801612854004,2,True,False,False

Pros
+ Based and Redpilled Rinwell / Pre Final Lord
+ Combat was fun for a while 
+ Looks Amazing

The whole games writing starts to fall apart after the Final Lord fight and the cool twist of the red woman but soon after the stupid Marvel Sky laser shows up.
The game goes from a well made and well crafted story and characters to Kingdom Hearts Friendship BS and bloated over explaining like Metal Gear. 

I was really enjoying the game but dam it just Falls to pieces and becomes yet another cringe Friendship and love vs god plot like its still 2005 JRPG all over again your party starts acting like they are brain dead and every scene is over powered by the bad writing of the second half. This made me lose all interest in playing anymore or ever coming back to finish the very predictable ending of ""Stopping the Darkness"" or the worlds will end. as if that's meant to drive me on to finish the game.

[olist]
[*]You get a glass cannon main character so you're pretty much reliant on having one of the two healer characters in the party in order to do damage to bosses who have super armor and can two shot you.
[*]You're either full HP or 1HP hoping to perfect evade enemies but you can barely see because there's so much crap cluttering your screen. Even when you do evade, your counter-attack only staggers normal monsters so you have to constantly perfect evade if the boss uses a multi-hit attack.
[*]Some strike artes do not combo well together and often have long start-up animations.
[*]They added too many elemental strike arts, found myself switching my artes every other battle during the end game.
[*]Cool looking bosses are just arena battles with annoying mob spawns while the real boss you want to fight sits in the distance shooting its elemental bullshit at you.
[*]They removed mana and gave you ""Cure Points"" which for some reason you have to use to unlock paths to get treasure.
[*]They kept the stupid title system from Graces and made all the skills stupid expensive making side quests mandatory for titles,exp, and gald. [b]The worst part is that you don't even get any costumes from them because they're all locked behind DLC[/b] and NO, I'm not wearing that farmer's outfit.
[*]There's a lot of repetitive dialogue and Skit dumping. Feels like the same conversation happened 5 times in a row but was just reworded differently.
[*]Every MOB in this game feels like you're using a stick to break a rock even with increased Penetration items.
[*]No joy in Boss fights. Kept finding myself killing enemies too fast to use my combos to their fullest extent. Can't do it on bosses because no stagger and aerial moves don't work on humanoid bosses.
[*] They added the title opening movie into the beginning of the game which spoiled most of the cast
[*] They added a second opening movie near the end game which lead you to think that there was more coming from the game.
[*] The story lacks a main villain any sense of a clear motive for any of the villains. They are just speculated to have reasons without any actual answers. There's an awkward mix of Scifi and Midieval in the story similar to that of [i]Graces F[/i] and leaves you asking more questions than answers.
[/olist]
[h1] Super Armor from past games[/h1]
[list]
[*][i]Symphonia[/i] gave bosses Over Limit to break through your combos, 
[*][i]Vesperia[/i] decided to just let the bosses break your combo chain whenever they felt like it, 
[*][i]Xillia and Graces[/i] made you block charge to stagger enemies...
[*]in [i]Arise[/i], you gotta wait for the correct boost strike to finish cooling down to stagger the boss for 5 seconds until it resets again only for you to die which depletes your boost strike completely.
[/list]
[h1]THINGS THEY DOWNGRADED[/h1]
[list]
[*]They removed most of the party strategy for the A.i so now you cant even tell your members which enemies you want them to focus on.
[*]They gave you 3/6 artes instead of 8/16 on your list because they wanted to add a jump button and a dynamic camera(which sucks).
[*]They added artifacts in the game completely removing the GRADE shop, destroying NG+.
[*]They removed blocking in favor of evading [strike]except for one character because her whole personality is BIG SHIELD MOMMY[/strike]
[*] Lack of Costumes but increase in attachments

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
I love the Tales series and I hope that they improve on their mistakes for the next entry.
Luckily they lowered the ridiculous over the top outfits that were in Berseria. The characters looked like they actually belonged in the universe this time around.
Arise felt like an attempt to return to the roots of the series. Unfortunately this entry had a severe lack of memorable side characters and villains.
It would be nice to see world building, actual dungeon puzzles, and a true nemesis villain in the series again.

Shockingly no, now granted I will say this is by no means a perfect game, it has it's issues which on the main part I will go into but for now I can say it's a fun game and what's more with some fixes it's the direction tales of game should be going from now on that's how much I like the new system dood.

Okay into the meat of things, Tales of Arise changed a few mechanics some for the much better, others for the much worse, some kept exactly the same disappointingly, We'll start with attacking, the new ways to attack are extremely awkward but you get used to them and that's the important part, now I'm a fan of Dark souls games to a degree but why games these days are deciding the best button for attack is R1 rather than square and the occasional triangle for heavy I don't know, that said it was probably to make way for the new combat system dood.

So talking of the new combat system, combat now has no MP...no seriously you can now play a spellcaster almost no hassle and this is outstanding and fun as anything to me, I say almost though because what the game does have is CP, what this is essentially is your heal/cure/buff pool, anything that does one of those three things costs you from your limited heal pool, now this is awesome to me because it lets attack magic shine but doesn't make the player over powered because of free heals, it's a great balancing act so to speak but it does have it's issues as it can be quite expensive and even ignoring that your team composition can be integral, there are two healers eventually but frankly I never wanted to use the other one to cut down on costs and play with the team I like most, which is totally fine outside of the usual arena affair as most tales of games have dood.

As I said R1 is attack now and for artes in it's place is A, X and Y, once you get used to that you can even get a nice flow of artes going from ground to sky, that said here comes an issue with the game, combo's activate in a timely manner most times but they don't always hit so to speak, often I will initiate an aerial attack only to find the enemy is too high or too low to continue a combo depending on the arte I used, some work better than others but sadly enemies are either too floaty or not floaty enough to make some work making some melee artes useless, nothing game breaking but certainly a shame dood.

Talking more about artes, they cost AG a free meter that refills over time, this is what allows you to string attacks together, a lot of which are great if you can find the right combinations, then we have dodging, now this one is a bit...bothersome to me, they replaced defending with it (although it still exists in one form but that's spoils) and that would be fine but some enemy attacks are quite finicky, often leaving you taking a full heaping of damage over half, the pay off granted is that a perfect dodge let's you counter and fills up a certain invisible meter later on but it's just not worth the effort and risk, especially if like me you are a spellcaster and even more so when a certain enemy type decides to appear and really make you regret playing a mage at all lol in the future though I suggest giving players both options for cases where dodging just ends up not being an option dood.

Let's go onto damage, Tales games have done this for a while now where having so much ATK will effect how much damage you do but in a weirdly set way based on enemy defence and your attack, ATK too low? Barely gonna damage them, attack decently high? you're gonna do x amount of damage despite them trying to make it look like you are doing different damage with slight number variation, high atk? you'll do a bit more but it will always be that kind of set amount meaning some fights end up being real chores time wise, same goes for defence for players but there seems to be an annoying extreme, for instance I have put all my herbs (permanent stat buffs) into my mage but despite her extreme magic resistance even fighting a boss or enemy of the same level or lower in some cases results in a lot of damage, there in lies an artificial difficulty that really hurts the game in general, even going as far as to make defence buff foods and the like basically useless and almost weird they put it in at all, same with ATK buffs, in the future I'd like to see them get rid of this silly system so people can actually just do damage as they should dood.

Cooking is a thing as I mentioned as usual, none of the effects honestly are good enough to warrant the effort or ingredients bar maybe exp buffs thanks to the damage system as I mentioned, that said to make up for that equipment is now set unlike prior games so no annoying upgrading of those to absurd levels and accessories can be upgraded but in a more meaningful and helpful way for once which greatly please me to see dood

Money is handled interestingly in this, you don't get it from combat but rather from quests, materials you find and found here and there oh and fishing which is kinda fun to a degree but nothing too special, items on the other hand are a bit less good these days, health gels now heal set amounts rather than % which is a gods awful decision as it means you absolutely need to rely on spell heals or very expensive healing items and the CP healing gels cost quite frankly absurd amounts to buy, especially early on dood.

There's a fair amount of strategy to the game, you can play pretty defensive with the right equipment if you give it time such as having 50% damage reduction on certain elements and such on accessories and they can be switched during combat for efficiency, sadly the strategy settings are quite complex now, you get set ones but they aren't great and AI isn't the smartest, often they are being revived a lot costing more CP which is a bad time dood.

The cast as always is great, that never changes from game to game with some stellar story moments and hilarious skits, this is something they've always gotten right and I pray they always will dood.

Relics are basically what you'd get in NG+ in older games only right away now and grade is done away with because of that, I highly appreciate this because as fun as grade was it was a hassle to get over one playthrough, they are basic to really handy things and a fun idea dood.

Last words? Again Tales of Arise isn't perfect, it's harder than it should be in the wrong areas and yet despite that it's fun as heck to play, it's a good beatable game as long as you aren't stupid about how you play, the main thing I will say that they need to neeever do again though is make the protag so useless outside of being in reserve, his main specials cost health to use which considering the damage rates in this is absurd, doubly so for CP costs, otherwise this games a blast despite it's issues and if they fix those issues I can see tales of games getting exceptionally good, thank you for reading and hope you enjoy the game too dood ^-^7",1686871007,1686871007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters developed in Tales are interesting and i did care for them though not as much as the ones in DQ11. The world is lush at times and the game does encourage you to explore, though again DQ11 does it a bit better. This line of commentary could be said for almost all of the Tales experience when compared to DQ11, except for the combat.
The combat is fast, fluid and never gets repetitive. I had to grow into the combat system of DQ11 in terms of really enjoying it, but with tales of arise I was gripped and enjoying the challenge of it from the beginning to the end. 
So the main selling point of this game is that it's a good above average JRPG with a memorable fighting system. If the writing of the plot and character development was better and a little more directed at adult audiences (a la persona at the very least) this could break into top tier category. As it is it treads the line of being a conservative and 'innocent' foil meant for teenagers (characters obviously love each other but here is zero romance, even a declaration of sentiments ) The music is good in some moments and in others sounds like something you'd hear in soul calibre (which for me is so-so, like generic epic music). Some of the later levels and fights are a bit unimaginative and the lore could be a bit more detailed. 
Overall this is a 8/10 (compared to DQ11s 8.5) If you like fast fighting in your JRPGs and don't want turn based pick this. If you want something a liiiiitle bit better and don't mind turn based, I'd say pick DQ11 over this. Ideally though? PLAY BOTH! :)",1686730195,1686730195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I felt the combat took awhile to get up to speed, once I had a full party, it's quite satisfying to see the action play out like your weekly anime fight. Of course, all the effects of your team casting spells and abilities can kinda make it a mess when trying to dodge the enemy attacks. 

While the game is quite meaty in terms of game play, it is quite heavy on the dialogue. QUITE heavy. Like, ""hold my beer, MGS 4."" levels of heavy. And while that does let you have a better chance to get to know your cast of characters, it can come across as a bit much by the end, especially given the the story isn't anything to write home about.  

I played 43 hours and it definitely felt like it. In particular: [spoiler] the third act drags on for way, WAY too long. There are a lot of lore dumps and areas the feel needlessly overlarge and empty. The finale is also the only time I wish I had grinded for levels, which was not a issue for most of the game. It also forced the issue of not having enough money and items by the end of it; this proved particularly brutal at the very end, though i was still able to finish the game without lowering the difficulty, i only managed by the skin of my teeth.

Combat is an important part of any Tales game, and this combat, while different from previous entries, is still quite good.  While previous Tales games had a block for enemy attacks, this one uses an evade/dodge roll/sidestep for all but one character.  If you dodge an attack in the proper timeframe, you'll have a cinematic style dodge and be able to counter attack.  The only issue with this is that the default controller control scheme has dodge on right trigger, and normal attack on right shoulder.  This can be awkward to hit the required timing to do the counter attack.  As you build up combos on foes, especially as they get low on health, you'll be able to trigger a combination skill with another character.  Finally, each character (including the two not in your active party) have a skill with a cooldown that provides some sort of unique function for the combat encounter, such as Shionne's anti-flying foe barrage that knocks flying foes (including some bosses) to the ground and opens them up to attack; or a later game character's ability to stop a charging foe in their tracks.  These unique functions make each character valuable in combat and makes the combat more dynamic.

Story is a bit more linear than many other Tales games, you don't get the typical openness until fairly far into the story.  There are some pacing problems late, one section in particular has a bunch of lore dump cutscenes, right after another, with just minor movement between.  Oftentimes there's not even any combat to break it up, just a few seconds of movement before the next scene.  Otherwise it was pretty solid.

Graphically it's really good, it makes decent use out of the Unreal engine's power, and ran well on my Linux desktop maxed out (Ryzen 5800X/RTX 3070).  That said, I wish there was a way to reduce some of the flashiness, and a way to reduce or disable screenshake.  Some attacks, both your own and your foes, do a ridiculous amount of screenshake which makes things hard to see and uncomfortable to sit through.  Sound's solid, nothing stands out (aside from bonus post-game content that used older game's music) but it's a workable soundtrack.  Sound effects worked fine,m and mostly conveyed the cues they needed to.

Voice work for the main game was pretty solid in English, though it was jarring to see such a high profile and high budget game use placeholder voice lines for most sidequests.  I can accept that in a lower budget title like Ni no Kuni II, but not Tales of Arise.  

Characters were pretty descent.  There was only one party member I wasn't super fond of ([spoiler]Law[/spoiler]), and the chemistry and interactions between Iron Mask[spoiler]/Alphen[/spoiler] and Shionne were pretty good.  I also liked [spoiler]Rinwell's[/spoiler] character development.  Character growth overall was pretty solid too.  There were some aspects of the character interactions or story that seem to be culturally tied, and a Western player would not always get why the dialogue went that way.  I might have understood it better if I watched anime or read manga.

A few cutscenes are anime videos, rather than in-game rendered cutscenes.  These are typically really pivotal moments, and while a bit jarring to see the different look of the characters, they worked well.  There's also a new skit system in this game, images arranged like a comic.  It took a little to get used to the new skits, but I felt they worked well for this title.

Side content includes a fishing minigame (which directly benefits you with cooking), weapon and accessory crafting (both of which are far easier than Berseria and especially Zestiria's equipment system), and the typical costume hunt.

Overall it's a solid title and well worth a play to action RPG fans.  Difficulty isn't too high (but you can turn it up if you want it harder), combat is fun with a lot of ways to spice it up or get some variety, and while not breaking any ground the story is fun for most of the game.",1686678269,1686678269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're a long time JRPG fan this is what this game has to offer you:

-A well built, fleshed out world full of unique locales with each realm having it's own distinct personality. Each realm is it's own unique story with an original premise. This game has a smart way of mixing traditional fantasy tropes with modern sci-fi elements.
-A long and complex story that has a lot to tell you and is full of surprises for those willing to play it till the end.
-The combat in this game is smooth while also being deep enough to justify the 60 hour campaign. Being an action RPG, it's about controlling your own character while calling in the right teammate at the right time to perform team attacks and chaining them into devastating combos. If you can master it's mechanics, you'll be able to call in cinematic attacks every 5 seconds making the fights more like interactive movies. Another cool thing is how you can choose to play as any member of your party. If you want you can play (almost) the whole game as a white mage, a black mage or a monk.

The graphics pretty much nailed the anime look.  You can expand or contract the amount of story and world building with the skits.  The music has lots of nods to the older games.  The battle system is fast and fluid, each character bringing a mechanic to use strategically, and enough extra gimmicks to play with.  There's plenty of voiced scenes with good voice work and quality. There's also a lot of nice little touches like seeing a lil' icon next to chat bubbles of folks you already talked to to know you did in fact talk to them already.  Lots to be pleased with overall.

Though I can't say it's all sunshine and rainbows.  While combat with regular enemies can feel quite fun and rewarding, and even some of the larger quest monsters are decent, fighting bosses is the worst thing in the game combat game play wise.  Sure the spectacle is there, but it almost always descends into a 7 or more minutes brute force endurance match.  The gimmicks each character has to counter certain move types?  Ignored half the time.  Split second attacks that you take on the chin (over and over again) because you're animation locked.  100+ hit combo?  Ignored and barely moves their life bar.  In the bigger fights later in the game the AI will frequently stand in effectively 1 shot attacks that are telegraphed, which adds a further drain on your resources.  The AI also doesn't ""learn"" a enemies weakness, which can then force you to go in and manually edit dozen or more of their skills so they stop using fire against the fire enemies, and of course you then need to set it back to normal afterwards.  And because the fight takes so long, you really reeeaaaaally get tired of using your sorta limited combos.  It's pretty high on my list of most obnoxious experiences for video game boss fights.

Also not a fan of dropping players into unwinnable ""boss"" fights.  Like if you don't the player to ""win"" an encounter, just make it a cut scene.  Why make the player waste their time and inventory on something they have a 99.99% chance of losing or are secretly supposed to just last for 3 minutes or something that basically just means you spend the whole entire time rolling around nonstop like a goofball.  It's not fun.  It's not suspenseful or making me think 'Oh wow this guy is so strong'.  It's just irritating game play in my opinion.

While on the topic of combat, there's a large chunk of unnecessary moves I feel.  Given you can only have a fairly small pool of abilities equipped, the dangers of being animation locked against a boss, or the enemy dies and you spend another 5 seconds slashing away at empty air it just feels hard to justify them all existing.  Even more so when you give each ability ranks to grind up with enough uses, because then you feel like you're wasting your time if you change from the ones you already have 100's of uses on.

Aside from the combat gripes above, the only over fairly large gripe I would have is the accessory crafting.  The core concepts are all enjoyable, but I hate the RNG aspects.  It's no fun to run around for hours trying to get things with the right traits you want (which you may not ever get because RNG), of the right rank you need, to waste leveling up ones you don't care about just to get a splattering of skills from.  And to attempt to counteract some of the most god awful boss fights, you'll want certain accessories powered up with certain skills.  The system is just designed to pointlessly waste your time and should have a much more deterministic approach.

So all wrapped up, I'd give it like a 8.5/10.  I'm very happy I bought it and do enjoy it taken as a whole.  I just wish they could do away with the obnoxious and irritating brute force boss endurance matches, bloated skill system, and RNG accessory grind-fest.",1685504489,1686418929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you understand that you can only control one character and the other 3 are AI controlled, and you see them getting knocked out in two hits without being able to do anything, thats bad.

The game basically required me at that point to grind regular enemies for hours until I leveled up enough so that my team members could tank that boss and not get one or two-shotted. Worse, healing items are quite expensive and over a bloody 30mn fight (yes, actual 30 minutes because the bosses have hundreds of thousands of HP, that is an actual design choice the devs made), you use a ton, I ended up being too poor to buy enough of them to sustain the boss fight.

Even so, it's not like I avoided fights earlier in the game, I fought almost every enemy group I saw in the whole game, and that still wasnt enough to be sufficiently leveled. 

I just don't like games that don't respect my time and expect me to mindlessly grind the same monsters for dozens of hours before a boss fight for me to be able to have a shot against him and not have the fight last half an hour.",1686070556,1686070556,False,5,0,0.55420297384262085,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, it did not cut it for me. I am not sure if this is only related to this game or Japanese game design in general but here are my takes.

The good stuff:
- interesting graphics
- kinky Japanese anime style all around (owls, ...)
- story seems to be going in the right direction

The stuff I did not like:
- terrible learning curve, where game introduces you to 20 different game mechanics in the first 2 hours of the game and you are overwhelmed by all the stuff you should be taking care of
- inventory management is just bad; the same goes for healing/food controls
- controls in general were non-standard imo; I play games my entire life but here I felt like clumsy non-gamer
- general game settings - I did not even find Exit game button. I constantly just Alt+F4 it, when I wanted to quit

So if I summarize this into shorter review - you are thrown into interesting and colorful world but overloaded with information, so most of the time you just have very slight idea what to do.

If you played any Bandai game before, then you are most probably going to enjoy this one, but if you are just trying to start with Japanese game titles, I do not think that this is the right choice.",1685882860,1685882982,False,3,0,0.522760629653930664,0,True,False,False

After that, the story becomes a bit of a slog. The ending has some twists and tons of cutscenes. Unfortunately, the end of the game is a tad grindy and the enemies, while not difficult, all turn into health sponges. The ending was satisfying albeit more abrupt than I'd prefer. I didn't hate the ending, but I would have preferred a few conversations during the prologue to wrap things up.

The characters are probably the weakest link. I liked the main character and a few others but everyone else is very anime cliched. A lot of dialogue, etc. seems to get repeated over the course of the game and once you get a gist of some conversations it almost forces you to skip through them to stay awake.

If this was my first Tales game, I'd be more impressed. However, I played Tales of Berseria and the plot there is just... better. Granted, Tales of Arise *looks* way better (beautiful in spots even) but I came for the story. Its not bad, it just falls between acceptable and great.

1. It's not that game is bad, it's probably really good in ""Tales"" category and Namco B. IS making games for PEGI 12, so youngsters will probably love it- it's for them after all. Big adults keep it in mind and lower dark ""Witcher"" expectations. I remember how extremely much in love I was in Kingdom of Hearts many years ago. Today I would probably found it silly too.
2. As old hag, I'm though, banging my head and screaming over cliche, silly, childish actions, painfully outworn relationships and conversations, anime overhealming cuteness and GASPING (Sooooo many gasping!), more often that I wish ( but again I saw those same and same structures way to many times in all JP productions through decades- new skins- same skeletons, but that's the point here I guess)

-It has moments I didn't expected in the story, so yeah some parts of it, are NOT that bad and predictable from some point (mind: SOME)
-Thank God for great ""side"" characters. Kisara- voice of maturity, Dahalim-voice of wisdom and Rinwell- well it's hard not to adore her in overall - those 3-  keeps me going
-Still can't find in myself any postiviness for Shionne and Alphen ( So.. Nantasu NT Elisabeth and Meliodas...  bleeeh, bleeeh and blurp, God they are so annoying)
-Law admited he's freaking stupid- so heh Naruto mode forgiven :D

Glass of wine, kick A&S from the party, school uniforms, arena school weapons, owl- riddiculus glasses for S&A - and suddenly everything is fun and has incredible sense! I Really DO enjoying this now! 
I just realise characters meaning. I'm grown up mum and I set Kisara as my well ...all. Simple creatures- we gamers are. But developers new that. You play Kisara- you have more Kisara acticity, concversations, attention on her el cetera. Same for other characters you feel more ""close"" with and use as ""you"". Psychollogical approach.

Plus:
-The concept of the story is simple yet fun to follow. The additional romantic spice somehow works, and the interactions between characters are interesting to follow.
- Each character has a unique build and playstyle, making building and playing each a worthy experience. After trying all characters, I chose to mains Law as he has a very huge potential if manually played.
- The fight is fairly easy, and since there is a lower difficulty, it should be playable for most players. Please take note this is an opinion of a normal difficulty player.
- Semi-open world concept gives a lot of grinding opportunities, both for level and money.
- The voice and soundtracks are good.

Minus:
- Somehow, I can't help to feel it lacks detail. Not visually, but the world and story building. The world feels so small and too straightforward, and how each region is created and explained seems not detailed enough. i.e., the ranks of Renan. There are sovereign->Lord->other Renan (mostly soldier). While some enemies are called captains, or so, they have no story at all, just a slightly stronger enemy, that's it.


In conclusion, it is still a very fun game to play. If you are a Tales series fan like me, there is no reason not to buy this game. If you're new to the Tales series, this game might not be the best to start.",1685811089,1685811089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat flows as smoothly as ever, and transitions between battling and free roaming are seamless. While the party isn't necessarily as interesting as the previous instalment, they still have sufficient depth and interactive possibilities, so it's worth engaging with them when possible.

The first half of the story has decent writing and allows you to get immersed in the circumstances of the regions you visit. Unfortunately, the second half of the main storyline is poor, and suffers from pelting you with far too much dialogue and exposition with little gameplay to break it up. The areas also become increasingly linear and devoid of environmental interaction, meaning it's easy to get tired of it. This issue is not present in the post-game or side missions, which possess the same high quality as the early-game.

Story starts off strong with themes of racism and slavery explored quite well, with each lords and their realms dedicated to explore many facets of those themes but it lacks nuances. In fact, the whole game lacks nuances and subtlety. You're meant to believe that a planet only has 5 countries in close proximity that you can travel to and between each cities by foot. Bandai Namco seems to forget that a city or a country needs trade and transportation for its economy, and yet each cities lack the basic logistic, except for 1 city (Menancia which is the most logical city with its shops, lifestyle, etc). All other cities focused too much on the theme of slavery and racism, they end up become caricatures. What do these people do for a living? How does each government operate? What kind of trade they have between each realms/countries? Tales of Arise seems to think these questions are too much for it to handle. When you have 5 countries with a sea in the center of them and there is only 1 country that has a ship, hidden from all the lords.. And then you inspect each realms/countries, look each castles and they all missed important details. There's no barracks, no training room for the soldiers, no meeting room, no storage room, not even toilets are there in the castles. It's baffling because Menancia is the only believable realm and Viscint, its city and its castle has most of these features. Arise often treat the lords' castles as just dungeons with monsters in every blocks of room. You can tell there's no logic in this world. Arise's world is not believable and in turn makes it hard to not see this as just a mere caricature, with no soul and thought put behind it.

Then comes the plot and the villains. What started from band of misfits on a journey to kill all the lords and liberate the planet, which by itself becomes predictable and tiring between each realms/countries, eventually turn into a tale of forgiveness and aliens. In theory, the plot seems fine but the way the game handled it is terrible. Arise seems to not have the patience to sit down and think on the aftermath of the liberation, instead it treats its plot in episodic nature, with its realm treated as stand alone episodes with no connection between each of them. Also the dialogue is really heavy-handed. By the last arc of the game, you're constantly bombarded with characters telling each other ""the world needs forgiveness, we need to liberate ourselves of hate"" over and over again, it becomes tiring and meaningless when you consider that the protagonists themselves also killed the lords without thinking, without considering there may be a room for negotiations. When a character goes all the way to the opposite mindset, preaching about forgiveness many times, even though he just killed many soldiers and lords just a moment ago. It's hard to believe these characters and their motivations. 
And then the villains. I have never seen such well designed villains with a complexity of a toddler. These villains are not people. They are defined by just two emotions; power and hatred. They have no personality, no connection to the protagonists, they come and go as quickly as they are introduced in the story. By the time the game tells you each lords' backstory, it's too late, most of them are already dead anyway. Vholran, the main villain doesn't have goal aside from beating Alphen and just hating on everybody. Arise deliberately made him seemingly to be a foil to Alphen with similar background, but do nothing to him. He's just there.. angry, all the time.

Then the combat. It's great on normal enemies and awful on bosses. Bosses have too much HP, deal very high damage on higher difficulties, reward too few experience points and all have hyper armor. Arise's combat relies on combo and guard break but when bosses break the game's own mechanics, it's just easier to spam the quickest artes and ones that deal the most damage over and over again. Then when you consider 90% of the time the screen is filled with flashy visual effect, making it hard to see the enemies' attack animations and which spells come from your enemies or your own party members, it becomes too much. The combat is flawed by itself but when you add the annoyances of the overly expensive item cost, the CP for cure and interaction situations, the dumb companion AI and each bosses can take as much as 15 minutes to kill . These really lowers down the quality of the combat. It's great that each characters play differently but like almost anything else in Arise, it is wasted potential. 

So, story is bad and predictable, villains are one-note, world doesn't make sense, dialogues are heavy-handed, skits are too long and they appear in bundles, pacing is all over the place, ending is cringe with its overly emphasis on emotion and love trumps everything, characters are not fully fleshed out. This leaves visual, music, control. RPG progression the only good qualities of Tales of Arise. Is this enough to be a good game? Probably. But for me, whose favorite Tales game is Tales of Abyss with its good cast of characters, story, good villains and good combat. It's hard to recommend Tales of Arise.

Arise is pretty and sounds good. I think these qualities sums up Arise perfectly, it's good on surface-level but digging it a little deeper, it's bland.",1685768494,1685768494,False,54,10,0.594695210456848145,0,True,False,False

Just finished the main story, so its about time for a review for this game. I'll be noting the good and bad parts of both the story, design and the gameplay:

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

[b]The good parts:[/b]
 [list]
    [*] It does the usual rpg elements and it's also almost open world! I've always enjoyed the rpg genre and this game was just as fun as other rpg games, so if you like these types of games, I recommend you give this a try.
    [*] The boss fights feel rewarding, especially after hitting those final blows (The Shionne/Alphen one goes raw when the enemy dies after). 
    [*] The combat is fun and doesn't feel too much of a drag as some rpgs do. The way you can customize what kinds of attacks you want to do feels very player friendly and to choose who you want on the battlefield is so nice!
    [*] The ""before sleep chat"" with one of the characters is a nice feature and is a good addition to both character development and world building.
[/list]

[b]The less good parts[/b]
[list]
    [*] This might be a skill issue on my end, but I had to change difficulty mid gameplay due to the boss fights getting too difficult (I started on normal and switched to story). Even if you fight every zeugle you see, you'll still be a bit underleveled.
    [*] Items in this game are a tad too expensive, especially mid-end game. For example, life bottle for 1000 gald that only heals 800 hp from k.o state is ridiculous. Sure there are other types of ko bottles but they're super rare to find (and I believe they're even more expensive). Make sure to always have at least 5 of each heal and cp gel with you and around 10 life bottle (mostly use them on either Dohalim or Shionne since they cant be ressed in one of them is not on the field).
    [*] The mini boss fights should all be ones you retry and not get thrown out! I absolutely malded through that Calaglia manthis boss because just as I was about to defeat it, my teammates and I KO and I get thrown back to the map and I lose all my items I spent on that combat. Some mini bosses are available to retry but man this gimick is annoying.
[/list]

[h1]The Story[/h1]

[b]The good parts:[/b]
[list]
    [*] I love the character development in the story. There were characters I disliked in the beginning of the game but as the story progressed they became a much better character. I could recommend this game from the character development alone.
    [*] The story has a simple story, but the world building and the overall important plot points made it ""predictable yet unpredictable"". The plottwists in this game were also well executed.
    [*] It can pull you in the heart strings in certain scenes, both angsty and wholesome.
[/list]

[b]The less good parts:[/b]
[list]
    [*] Way too much dialogue in my opinion, but fortunately they could be skipped. I of course did not skip through the story but there were times I would pull up my phone to pass the time. Subquests for example are easy skips for me and I'm grateful the dialogue in it can be skipped hastefully.
    [*] While I feel like the mc plays an important role in the story, his personality did not really stand out in end game since many more of the characters stood out more. It's not a big problem, and he does have traits that stand out but there were better characters.
[/list]

[h1]The Design[/h1]

[b]The good parts:[/b]
[list]
    [*] The character design is great, and I like that the female characters are not all fanservice! It fits so much better their characters and the environment around them. The male designs are also neat, I love the design for Dohalim, he's peak.
    [*] The screenshots bout to be insane for this one. The world is beautiful and even the dangerous environments are so aesthetically pleasing. 
    [*] While I did think the music was a tad too dramatic at first when exploring, it toned down a bit mid-game. That of course doesn't mean the music was bad, I did enjoy it a lot (some pieces are in my spotify ost playlist).
    [*] Cutscenes fit nicely to different contexts and didnt look too awkward, I also enjoyed the few anime ones the game has.
    [*] Give the person who put the lohikeitto dish in the game a raise, perkele.
[/list]

[b]The less good parts:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Not much to complain here, only thing that bugged was the lack of design diversity in NPCs. They all looked pretty forgettable. I know they're supposed to be more simple but I'd love if there were a bit more to the design of important npcs.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

A fun story based single player rpg I recommend to anyone who likes character development and world exploring!

[b]Story[/b] 
It was captivating, with a lot of unpredictable twists. It has a great plot, a long length of main story, the party bonds and character developments throughout the storyline and skits. most of the skits are unique, interesting and funny. It helps to support the gap in the story, get to know the characters more deeply, and seeing their relationships growing with each other as well. (Party bonds and character developments are the reason why I started to love this game even more.) 

[b]The gameplay[/b] 
The 1st half of the game is actually decent, but then it slowly starts to feel rushed in 2nd half of the game. As a results, dungeons in 2nd half of the game are quite lengthy and dragging. The sub quests are also quite repetitive too, only leaving a few that are actually interesting. Most of the side quest are basically asking you to attack Zeugles and then come back for reward. 

[b]The battle mechanics[/b] are solid, and responsive. Every attack hit is satisfying and addicting. Though the default control scheme are kinda odd to me. Like RB/R1 button for attack, and B/Circle for jump. But despite the weird control scheme, I just keep it default as it is. 

[b]The graphics[/b] 
Decent, eye pleasing and well designed. Details are great, Each Realm feels really unique. From the constant hot of Calaglia, The snowy cold of Cyslodia, The vibrant green of Elde menancia, etc. And it performed very well on my PC, thanks to Bamco for using UE4.

[b]The soundtracks[/b] 
Well composed and memorable. Each area has it's own mood, and they fits pretty well, which helps immersed the game a lot. 

[b]Conclusion[/b], 
Tales of Arise is a fantastic game. It was so fantastic that when I beat the game, I started to feel empty. But aside from that, If you want to experience a good story with a great character development, this is a perfect game for you. It's also a Great game to start Tales series too IMO.

Best and memorable game i've played in 2022. might have a new game+ once i 100% the game (I hope)

From its breathtaking visuals to its engaging narrative and captivating gameplay, this game is a true gem that leaves players spellbound from start to finish.

First and foremost, the graphics in Tales of Arise are nothing short of extraordinary. The game world is beautifully realized, with lush landscapes, vibrant cities, and stunningly detailed character designs. The attention to detail is remarkable, and each location feels alive and immersive. Whether traversing vast open fields or exploring intricate dungeons, the visual splendor never ceases to amaze.

Beyond its visual allure, Tales of Arise boasts a rich and compelling story. The game introduces a cast of diverse and well-developed characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. As the narrative unfolds, you become deeply invested in their journeys, their triumphs, and their struggles. The overarching tale of oppression, freedom, and the power of unity is told with skill and grace, leaving a lasting impact on the player.

One of the game's strongest aspects is its combat system. Battles are fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The combination of real-time action and strategic elements keeps you constantly engaged, and the smooth controls make executing flashy combos a joy. The diverse roster of playable characters adds depth to the combat experience, each with their unique fighting styles and abilities. As you progress, you unlock new skills and abilities, providing a sense of progression and customization that keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting throughout.

In addition to the main story, Tales of Arise offers a plethora of side quests and optional content to explore. These side quests are not mere distractions but rather meaningful stories that further flesh out the world and its inhabitants. The world is teeming with secrets to discover, hidden treasures to find, and challenging boss battles to conquer, providing countless hours of gameplay beyond the main narrative.

The sound design and musical score in Tales of Arise deserve special mention. The voice acting is top-notch, with stellar performances that bring the characters to life. The music perfectly complements the emotions and atmosphere of each scene, whether it's an intense battle or a heartfelt moment of reflection. The orchestral arrangements and memorable melodies elevate the game's already superb presentation, making it a feast for both the eyes and the ears.

In conclusion, Tales of Arise is an absolute triumph in every aspect. Its stunning visuals, captivating story, exhilarating combat, and immersive world-building make it a must-play experience for fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Bandai Namco has delivered a game that not only honors the legacy of the Tales of series but also stands as a testament to the potential of video games as a powerful storytelling medium. Prepare to embark on an unforgettable adventure like no other.

The story starts off good then plummets, all characters feel super cliche and are not believable. The world feels artificial and revolves around your group. There are also quests like ""help this guy improve his fashion"" by finding clothes or sth; bro you are in the middle of a civil war no man's land in the desert, everyone is wearing rugs and has no water or food, the house behind you is literally about to collapse, your neighbour is probably crushed under his, there's like 50 scorpions near your ""town's"" gate, I think fashion is the least of your worries. This is what I said about the story and world, and there are many examples like this, where parts of the narrative are incompatible. 

The combat is a button spam mess. It has no weight, and the mobs are damage sponges, so you have to repeat the same air combo 5 times, lifting a dude with 100kg armor into the air like it's nothing, while he is borderline T-posing floating into the air (because there are no air idle animations for mobs even though half of the attacks in this game launch enemies into the air), until you do the insta kill-ish attack.
Also you can just stack plenty of HP, revive and ""mana"" regen items, so it's quite hard to actually lose a fight, but they still take like 10 to 20 minutes sometimes for bosses, in which you just spam the same combo dozens of times.

So, anime graphics good, music ok, story meh, combat yikes. 

The real bad? You can buy ""DLC"" which improves your party's stats, inventory size, gold, merchant discount, and whatever. Quite typical of Bandai Namco, yet no less scummy.


TL;DR If you really like anime RPGs and pink haired tsundere girls, this game is for you. If you don't care whether a game is anime or not then this is not a good game, just mediocre. Maybe it would have been good if it was released 15 years ago

Perhaps that's why some dislike the story.
The story is absolutely amazing imo.  Not all feel as
I do.  But this is true with any media.  But no one can
say that great effort went into the telling of the story.
  
Combat is hell to learn (for me), but once you get used
to the mechanics and what each team member offers, it's
not bad.  
There's the option of auto combat and you manage the
potions used and when to use Artes.  
I started doing this about half way through the game.

I really liked how the characters grew.  Very well done.
I don't want to say much more as the character growth is 
big for me and any hints would be a story spoiler.

Crafting is ok, gathering is ok also. Nothing unusual or unique
here I don't think.

Armor and costumes look very good.  The outfits really do fit 
the characters. 

I give this game an easy 9/10.  I did find the grind over the top.
But many JRPGs are like that.  Actually many RPGs are like that.
But to be fair, I don't think the grind was game time filler.  There is
a reason for it.  Examples:  for potions, gold, to craft and to level.
I mostly grind so I'm a higher lvl than the mobs in a zone.  
So by grinding, I'm a higher lvl, have a full stock of potions and food
and I rarely lose a fight.

But yes, a solid 9/10  I will play a second play-through for sure.

Exploring the dungeons and overworld is a joy, too, especially with new map abilities that make traversal engaging.

I've played almost all serial tales from the playstation 1 console to the playstation 5 starting from a dozen years ago. And has finished almost all the series.

Would've preferred Do and Kisara's perspective over Alphen and Shionne's.
Because both of the villains are forgettable pieces of trash you need incredibly strong protagonists and the two they chose fall flat, Shionne's development is nice and it was cool to see Alphen develop into a mediator Dohalim fit the protagonist role better overall for the kind of story that is told albeit, they were more a band of ragtag fighters more than liberators with Dohalim taking the backseat.

The graphics and design are awesome but that's where the positives end. It goes down hill fast when it comes to game play and battle sequence.

Do you like our new action combo system? Forget it, bosses expect you to spam the same skills again and again. 

Do you enjoy weapon and accessory crafting? You'll be so low on gold from wasting it on reviving your allies (yes, healing is limited and yes, the AI will constantly destroy itself) that you won't want to experiment. 

How about the simple joy of exploring and levelling? Well, enemies are heavily reused and the pace of levelling is glacial even if you do fight everything that crosses your path... well, unless you pay extra $$$.

You'd think this would all at least have made for a challenging game, but once you figure out the boring way the game wants you to play it's pretty mindless (even on hard). Every terrible game design decision [i]mysteriously[/i] has microtransactions to solve it. There are gacha games that feel less needlessly punitive. 

How about the story? Tales games tend to at least be charming. This one starts with some promise, but quickly runs out of things to say leaving you disinterested at best and resentful at worst.

[VAGUE SPOILERS]

The game starts with themes of racism and reparation, but undermines them with an uninteresting 'chosen one' narrative (some people are just intrinsically superior I guess!?!?!?).

So much of the story is built around generic NPCs that appear and immediately come to comically abrupt ends. Why does generic NPC #27 occupy more narrative space than half my party?

There are so many contrived plot twists, but none of them meaningfully change how you see the world or characters. Worse still, the game feels the need to [b]constantly[/b] explain every obvious thing ad nauseam. I never thought I'd actively dread skits in a Tales game. 

Are the characters at least good? Well, the game quickly gets bored of them so calling them characters might be too generous. Dohalim has crippling PTSD for a scene or two, then just doesn't. Kisara goes through a scene of overwhelming righteous fury, then the plot forgets about it 5 minutes later. You could watch every character scene out of sequence and it'd feel equally meaningless. 

How can I care about the story, characters or even gameplay when the game doesn't? Play Tales of Vesperia, the Trails Series, Dragon Quest or any number of other games that let you walk away with [i]something[/i] positive.",1684502324,1684502324,False,27,1,0.596035242080688477,0,True,False,False

A game taking a dozen hours to finally get to the decent parts of the plot, and then squandering it by resorting to anime cliches (DBZ memes come to mind) is a relatively bad formula.  Be warned:  It'll take a while to see most of the strengths of the game.

Yet there definitely are strengths:  the visuals alone are impressive.  The characters look hawt for sure.  The music is mostly mediocre but there are some good tunes later in the game.  The combat gets compelling after a while, especially after you start unlocking more skills and getting used to it:  but it was relatively boring at the beginning

You know, this game's biggest strength is, ironically, how well sidequests integrate themselves into the main atmosphere, they really help you feel like you're helping people, and character dynamics as a whole.  The cast does seem to care about and like each other.

That said, the writing lays it on thick at times, one character who was kinda racist for some time (her people have been enslaved for centuries so it's definitely understandable) and who is otherwise a kind and pleasant person started getting grating until she finally says, in a cutscene and after defeating the boss responsible for her personal pain, ""People are individuals and painting them all with a broad brush is unfair.""  This was after she went out of her way to decide not to kill the boss herself.  It's as if the game fell over itself to beg us to like her after slowly showing us that hatred had been consuming her.  It's lucky that I already liked her for her pleasant behavior before then but I do admit it would have been a lot more compelling if the writing leaned into how she couldn't let go and how she must work through it to be a better person.  Sure, she's learning how to overcome her hatred, but it's too forced, the way they've done it is unnatural and borderline mary sueish

And thus I'd say the writing is definitely hit and miss.  The parts that miss include a decent chunk of the plot, they kind of phoned it in at the start, did a bit better deeper in, and then stumbled into more anime cliches, almost as if the climax was still in relatively early game LOL.  The ending is good, though.  If you're willing to slog for dozens upon dozens of hours to get there that is

I'm shocked this game got best RPG of 2021, were there no other good RPGs at the time?  Do they give out these awards to larger companies (Namco) or to good visuals?  I recall Genshin being rather new around then...  And Genshin's visuals pretty much match these in some respects.

Whether the game is worth your time will ultimately be up to you.  The game's strengths were compelling for a while for me, but eventually I just grew tired of it.  Best to wait for a sale if you're curious like I was",1682192658,1684223093,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Man. Let me tell you. One of the best purchases I've made this entire year in terms of gaming. The cast of characters are so intriguing, and each of them have dynamic and thoughtful backstories and motivations. 

The voice acting cast is absolutely fantastic. Honestly in a world where most people skip cutscenes or speed through dialogue, doing so in this game would be a complete disservice to the amazing plotline, and even yourself for missing out on some of the really thought and feeling provoking interractions and story arcs. 

The battle system is the icing on the cake here, with a near seamless combination of tactical and free flowing combat that feels somewhere between vintage RPG and Devil May Cry. Every single time I play this game, finding a stopping point seems harder and harder, as the impulse is to keep playing to see where the story is going next.

I like the modern aspects of being able to ski[ through dialogue in cut scenes. the seamless transitions from battle arena into the over world.

Story is typical jrpg, nothing crazy. Characters are fine but they can be annoying at times in typical Jrpg  archtypes as well but it's passable. Battle system is very fun except for a few things. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and the bosses and larger monster become HP SPONGES. Like holy hell they have so much hp I actually get bored in many of the end game battles. Also some monsters can only be defeated with the tag team attacks which can be annoying if you don;t want to look at an animation and just want to end a battle instead. 

Another thing is that the game does a pretty bad job of telling you (Unless I've completely missed it) at what level certain ""bosses"" are. There are some gigantic versions of normal bosses that are on the overword and some can be beaten at lower levels while some require you to be a higher levels. Thing is I haven't noticed which ones I can fight and which ones I can't yet so you'll end up triggering a battle, finding out that the boss is level 80 to your level 25 and cry because the game doesn't let you run from these battles so you're forced a game over.

Another thing to note is that there is NO ENEMY VARIETY at all. It's all the same enemies but different color s and levels in each different area of the game. It get's tiring to fight the same enemy variant over and over again.

Combos are very fun to create and chaining moves together is probably my favorite thing about Arise's combat. Almost every character besides 1 or 2 of them are pretty much broken coming mid-late game. The MC is just nuts along with Shion. Quests are alright, mostly get item drops form killing monsters or finding and killing monsters/ clear some dungeon, basic Jrpg game play loop.

Overall I had a good time with the game, though coming late game it did become a slog to finish it out though. Granted I've only beaten the story and a few post-story content but honestly I'm content with just doing that for Arise.",1683882345,1683882345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a student of the first Tales games on the Playstation in the mid/late 90s and played most of them up until Vesperia which was the last game I played until this one. With that in mind I can whole heartedly recommend this title for most newcomers. They have clearly cut out a lot of excess and stream lined the experience to a knife point. The result is a mostly tight, linear roller coaster that is a lot of fun. I still recognize the Tales brand of characters and plot in this entry, but both have some welcome updates. The game seems tuned around delivering a well paced story. So many aspects are stream-lined to get you to the next point of what is a surprisingly long game. 

So lets talk about a few aspects of the game.

The story. Overall, I found the story to be pleasant. I don't think it will win any awards on prose, but it's delivered well and the emotional points hit you like a good Shounen anime (lol). I was engaged and wanted to see the next point pretty much all the time. There is a bit of redundancy/padding around the third quarter of the game where I found I wanted to skip some dialogue, but it isn't a huge detraction. The main story ends up quite a bit longer than I would have initially thought given the pacing of the game, but I didn't feel like it was severely dragging. Honestly, It could have maybe used a little post game world building, but I think that is just because I want more and that, in my book, is always what I'm looking for in a RPG. That I want to see more of the world and its characters. It gave me what I wanted in a satisfying way, but I still want more.

The characters. You've got most of your standard anime archetypes, but unlike older games in the Tales series I didn't find anybody annoying, which is surprising. The characters are dealing with some mature themes and circumstances through the archetypal lens but somehow manage to avoid falling too deep into any one trope as to be discounted as frivolous. Sure, there are plenty of cliches and tropes but I found most of them endearing and not overdone (maybe outside of the comedy punching bag that is Law). The relationship progression between the two main characters is well done and super sweet. Its understated but shown well. Honestly I don't know why they can't write some of the story elements the way they do character elements.
There are plenty of character moments where the characters know something that isn't told to the player. Through context and character motivations we know what that something is, obviously, but the point is that it doesn't have to be shown. This contrasts the games story as it almost never done that way. The characters are constantly defining the thing you just saw or went through. Telling you exactly how you should feel and think about it. 
Overall I liked all the main cast, but I wish Kisara had some more development as she is a goddamn angel. I even put her in angel wings and a halo. Don't judge me.

The Art Direction/Graphics. The game really benefits from the modern engines and art styling. Its a pretty game by most measures and it really helps sell the action on screen. The colors are vibrant and the character models are nice and detailed. The world has your nice elemental variants and each is pleasing to the eye. I don't have much to say about this. I liked what I was looking at most of the time. If I had any gripes it would be that enemy variants get redone pretty quickly and that I miss the old 2D anime skit faces, but I can forgo the latter.

The combat. I've heard Berseria has some fantastic combat but as I haven't played it yet I can't compare the two. I can only compare it to the others I have played. Unlike older entries, the combat is smooth and reasonably fast paced which helps the fun factor. Its definitely not deep...you don't really have to think about it too much in my book, but the boost strikes and combos are fun to do and look at. If you are looking for a more complex fare...honestly the Tales series probably isn't the place to look in my experience. There are a couple gripes I have with the combat and design though. Firstly, the end game seems designed so that instead of making battles more interesting or complex they just get more health and padding, so if you aren't properly over leveled or prepared they tend to drag more than they should. For a game that seems intent on stream lining the experience this seems to cut against that philosophy. Having a lot of enemies on screen is still a pain to deal with when you have to deal with groups of different 'boost types'. I know maybe it was a small part of previous Tales games, but wheres my player two option for other characters in battle man? I wish there was a little more choice over character progression in the talent grid, other than to grind so you get more powerful.
The only real control you have is probably relegated to accessory crafting and which ones to equip, but honestly It was never so important as to be a necessity. I played on hard the entire game and the most use I got was probably from decreasing aggro and stacking penetration on key characters depending on how you play. The rule editing is there but was never really necessary. You are usually fine with the default rule set, maybe just with tweaking item and cp usage, and by late game you should have enough cp and cp items to where even that doesn't really matter.

The gameplay. This is probably what would lose some points on any other game. As I said before this game seems tuned to deliver a well paced story. So much so that most of the game is cut down on to facilitate that happening. Thankfully those offerings are quite good so you can overlook the poor side-quests, lack of secrets and boring dungeons. Most of the side-quests are either pointless or uninteresting except a few that have character building interactions. Mostly you will probably want them for Gald and SP though, so thankfully they are pretty quick to complete, usually involving fighting a monster or two. The late game 'super boss' quests are pretty fun and difficult, but only in the sense that you need to be a super high level to even attempt. The owls were quaint and i liked the accessories, but they were quite easy to find. The level design is all pretty straight forward, nothing overstays its welcome but it also was somewhat boring to me. There really aren't any puzzles or interesting mechanics i can remember. Just gated progression and rather pointless CP walls for accessories or items that you will want. I like a good puzzle. I'm not looking for a Lufia 2 depth of puzzle in this already long game, but surely you can feed me something to think about instead of blitzing through the area and mercing all the mobs. They give you a ranch for meat...and yeah. Its there, that's about all I can say about it.

The music. I can't say much about the music. I thought it was good, everything fit in its place, but nothing really popped out at me either, which isn't a complaint. It just helps to sell the moments the game is providing you. There aren't any annoying ear worms here, its all suitably bombastic, dreary, or sad when it needs to be.

Voices: Most all the voice acting for the main cast is fantastic. There is only so much dynamic in delivery but the characters say some really cheesy things and are able to deliver it in a non cringe inducing manner (mileage may vary). That's mostly a joke, but seriously, props to the English VAs for a job well done.

Gameplay wise, there are options to let the AI handle all the fighting because gameplay is just a mechanism to advance the cookie cutter story from one event to the next. Walk to area, murder everything, cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, repeat. Grinding is kept to a minimum. There's a fishing minigame too. 

Graphics are mixed. The new engine does a good job, but to me it lacks a charm that the old engine used in Tales of Vesperia had. In the attempt to maintain the status quo from other games all the potential of the Unreal Engine is discarded for its cel shader.

I fell blindly for the tons of positive reviews and gave it a try... for over 50 mostly tiresome hours. I tried so hard to like this game and really hoped with further progress it will 'click' somehow. But it's the same thing over and over and over again. There's no question gaming is heavily subjective, yet there are so many questionable design choices that I still cannot believe the general enthusiasm about this game.

What's absolutely ridiculous is the fact that this is supposed to be kind of a AAA-ish game, with a non-sale price of around 80 bucks. Yet there's heavy monetization on top that's not even cosmetic, but has a significant effect on the playability, and the game partly induces the need for having these features.

Talking about playability. While the combat is flashy and can be exciting for the first few hours, it becomes incredibly repetitive. It's rarely more than button smashing with the plethora of artes changing the feel at least a little bit. But calling this the best combat system, as so many reviews stated, is preposterous and only reasonable if this is the first action game you've ever played.

What really blew my mind is the insanity of combat chatter. Which game designer in their right mind thought: 'Hey, let's have all characters call out their skills every time they use them AND have additional conversations in between'. It's an unimaginable mess. 4-6 characters constantly calling out their skill names (SWORD RAIN ALPHA... MEGARAY) while chattering (Why did you heal me? -so you don't die! Ah, right!) mixed with enemy noise, effects, and music. Its apex is one character literally saying 'Blah blah blah.' To make it worse, it's always the same lines over and over again. During the countless repetitive battles, you listen to the same repetitive chatter countless times. Sorry, Bandai, but this is bad, and you should feel bad!

There are tons of other head-shaking stuff like Side Quests without level or difficulty indication (your first side quests is only doable end/post-game 50+ hours later) or things like boss design, where it's 4/5 of the time button smashing, and the last 1/5 the boss ends up spamming one-shot attacks. Not to mention the cheesiness of story/dialogue or the several rip-offs from other games (seriously... Red Woman?)

It is a flashy game that's appealling visually, but if you've ever played and enjoyed other action games like Nier, God of War, Horizon, or any FromSoftware Game - Tales of Arise feels just cheap - to an extent that it has the quality of a mobile cash-grab game.

Character traits are sometimes ignored or repeated and you are immediately given someones backstory upon meeting them pretty much lol. What makes the best Tales games so special is how the characters comment on the smallest things or how you dont know much about a member of the team until much later and it has a huge impact. I am willing to sit through shitty dungeons, less impressive graphics, and weirdly placed side quests if it means i can see the characters interact. This is a mediocre experience so far.

Pro:

-Visuals and Performance are good.
-15h in and not crash,lags or any bugs to speak of. (yea...thats a pro in Gaming these days...)
-Combat is fun and reminds of Anime Series like naruto or dragonball.
-World and Enemy Design is consistent and fits the theme.
-Epic Battle Moments, even if much of it is caused by chance. This is no tactic Game in any way.


Con:

-Story is the typical 0815 anime fight the evil guys stuff
-Combat system isnt explained well enough and alot of stuff is lead by chance instead of tactic or planing
-Skills dont have % or damage or anything stat related explained in the skilltree. You have to test and see in combat what is doing what.
-Party Charachters act too often like spoiled 15y old.
-Game suffers from never ending pointless and boring dialogs and conversations, like many of the Asian A-RPG´s. I fast click through 90% of the dialog because its just aweful.

As you progress you notice a pattern of the characters expressing their struggles to the others. But they aren't given the chance to develop as characters because this becomes obnoxiously repetitive. Character is sad for some reason. Other's cheer em up. Scene over. Later in the game, character gets sad for the same reason, players tell em to stop b*tching. Accept this happen multiple times and it gets annoying real fast. Like I said the characters revert back to square 1 for plot convenience and are not given the chance to have an arc. 

Another problem with the story is that it is explained through massive lore dumps. Characters become unnaturally detective and explain everything the players have already witnessed. Like the writers are doing an 8 hour lecture in a pseudo history class. This gets even worse in the second half of the game as before you know it you get all the answers before the final boss! Everything down to the lore and every cutscene. There is no subtlety at all!  

In the Tales of series, it is well known that they have skits. The skits don't often mean much to the story but when done right, you get a glimpse of the personalities of the characters. Not only that but a few laughs here and there. Yeah you don't get that in this one. The skits here are where most of the lore dumping is spat out and when they try to be funny it is just soulless and cringe. They are not even 2d here either. Just stills of the models flapping their lips in the most robotic way possible. LAZY! But I digress.

Looks amazing (actually manages to look better ingame than the 2D cutscenes). Voices (played Japanese voices) are top notch, with one exception - there was this one scene where the guardswoman cries - completely ruined, it's SO bad, almost Alt+F4-ed. It's supposed to be sad but it's like a 6-year old impression of crying and it last for so long, it was very grating.
The one other minus - didn't see a way to pause during cutscenes and that turns pretty bad since there's no balance between fighting times and cutscene times. At one point there's like cutscene after cutscene for literal hours and I was getting worried because I wanted to go to the bathroom. Some cutscenes can get a little boring too tbh. At times you have one fight 3 cutscenes over and over, at others you have 2 hours of fight.
There's a fishing minigame - it's easy enough but annoying, not sure why they keep adding fishing minigames in most Japanese games, they're passable at best, frustrating at worst, don't think anyone actually enjoys them.
You can complete all achis and everytning ingame in one go. There's also New Game+ option but atm not sure why I'd want to try that since I got everything in the first run.

I was skeptical at the auto-battle functionality at first, but it made grinding a lot more palatable when I can setup my tactics and let the game run itself. Higher difficulty just made for more spongy enemies, save yourself some headache and hours of your life, just play on a lower difficulty. There's no achievement difference. 

I might even fire up a NG+ since I was a bit sleepy through some of the early story bits. They repeat themselves quite a bit though, so you'll catch up whether you like it or not. Certain characters have very specific motivations, and they make sure to keep hammering on those points later in the story. The love interests are all very peckish and shy, which makes sense for the kids, less for the older members of the party. The big bad guy at the end could have had more level design around them. The concept was cool, the execution felt a bit rushed. Didn't really see it coming either way, so not bad.

If you're going to 100% the game, most of it comes naturally. Make sure you're camping every hour to keep up with your group members. Make sure to check your ranch animals when they're ready. Those were the only real time gated issues. You'll want to keep track of your own fish when you start that part. You don't have to cook every food item, just collect the recipes, which is nice. You DO need to craft pretty much every possible weapon, so don't throw out your old weapons, they're used for upgrades. You can sell your armor as soon as you find something better. The ultimate group battle in the arena doesn't have a pre-requisite, but it'll probably be the last thing you do all powered up. I thought I blazed through it fast, and was about 20 seconds from failing it.

Combat, outside of auto-battles, isn't hard to catch on. It IS hard to get your team to use the skills you assign. Thankfully there's no achievements for getting their skills leveled up. Each member has three main skill types that level up, and they unlock additional skills. So the melee fighter has punch/kick/skill, the punch and kick level up naturally, but you'll need to set a tactic to make sure he actually uses his skills in the fights or he will ignore them. Lots of the aerial skills just don't go off naturally, I'm not sure if the AI just doesn't understand they can jump, or they explicitly need a knock-up skill first. For one of the MC's it's about half of their kit, never got that figured out, but they managed fine anyway.

All in all, as long as they keep ripping Denuvo out of these games, I'll keep buying them. I've got no patience for garbage DRM in my life, so it's nice when you get a game a year later that's fully patched and tested.",1682914103,1682914103,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played over 20 hours and just couldn't get into it. Despite a great start, the story just never hooked me, the gameplay was a little fun but rough, the music was oddly placed, and the characters never interested me. Tales of Arise looked quite a bit different, so I was hoping I could get into it.

It took me about a year after i bought it to finally play it, but I'm glad I did. It's a major improvement in a lot of ways. The gameplay is fluid, hype, and fun. The characters are interesting and fun to watch. And the surrounding themes of the story are great. 

The bad:

I have one word that represents probably the biggest problem for this game: pacing. For a game released only a couple of years ago, it baffles me how often the cut-scene transitions are jarring. One moment, the characters are in one backdrop and the next moment they are in another. My brain can fill in what happened between the two scenes, but considering PC load times are extremely fast, I don't get a moment to take in the previous scene or even the atmosphere of the new one. Another pacing issues comes from the speed at which dialogue progresses at times. The game seems to leave very little room for you to take in an important line and grasp the subtleties of it before another character interrupts them or even worse the scene ends abruptly.

I absolutely LOVE the concept of the staple Tales skits and enjoyed watching them. Unfortunately, my enjoyment was thwarted because of the quantity you get at once. At many points in the game, you will be presented with 3 skits back-to-back. Because I don't want to miss any, I play them as soon as they are available. This absolutely kills pacing for me. All 3 skits are entirely different conversations, so it's jarring listening to them back to back. This could be fixed by simply dropping them one at a time throughout a dungeon or zone. Some may find this approach to be distracting, but I for one like to take a breather in a really long dungeon and get immersed by the conversations that would naturally occur as the party travels together. This is by far the biggest problem I have with this game.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't rage quite a bit from the game play. I'm very new to Tales, so I didn't understand that Tales is balanced around AI programming. It would seem the game wants you to program the AI so that you can change AI tactics on the fly. It mentioned this to me early on, but put no real emphasis on it. Because of this, my teammates would constantly get killed in a boss fight, seemingly outside of my control. This was rage-inducing and I hated it. Since I was still liking the game, I took to Google to figure out what I was doing wrong. After tweaking the AI settings, I eventually found some presets that worked for me and substantially improved the experience.

I'm going to praise the story below, but there are many shortcomings. Character interaction can be very awkward and the writers tend to deliver on big plot points without proper buildup. The pacing issues that surround the game only exacerbate this, leaving me disappointing with the potential the story and characters had to be truly amazing.

The Good:

As mentioned, Tales of Arise's combat is fluid and fun. It has spectacular visuals that really help sell the weight of attacks and flashy animations that really gets you hype. It was difficult to get used to at first, but I found that finally using Manual mode helped tune the game to my Action Game sensibilities. 

The combat is great, but my favorite thing is actually the story. Not specifically what actually happens, but the themes and concepts surrounding them. As with the best stories, characters are king and the two main characters really prove the point. I loved their interactions and really enjoyed seeing them grow together.

Conclusion:

Despite me having a lot more to say about the bad, I overall really enjoyed this game. I got sucked in by the game play, but stuck around for the characters and story. Despite the very rough pacing, I was able to find a game that I enjoy and one I'll likely remember for a very long time.

I felt that the story was somewhat lacking. Whenever you play a game, you have to suspend your disbelief a little, but here I was having to do that far too often. Overall though, I'll admit the story was interesting and pretty fun. My main issue comes from the characters. The protagonists are all bland and the skits are nowhere near as comedic as the ones from Berseria.

The antagonists are exceptionally bad. (I won't go into any detail to avoid spoilers.) The ""rival"" antagonist's motives and actions make very little sense. At one point in the story, he could have become a sort of Chrono Trigger Magus-like character or an ffxiv Zenos-like character, but it never really panned out. Just became a boring ""I'm Angry"" villain. As for the ""main"" antagonist, there isn't much that can be said. It was disappointing. More interesting things could be done to drive home the themes. Artorius from Berseria did an amazing job interacting with the thematic elements of that game. The antagonist here was just something that had to be dealt with, (mostly) uninvolved with the story's themes.

So NOT only do you have a tremendously LONG trek from point A to Point B on Rena but you only get 1 magic spot that heals you completely (which is located some distance from the last fight) then you have to fight SOLO which is a dodge heavy fight (and my comp doesn't respond to dodging well or i just suck, lol).

Rating: 2/5 Stars

As an avid gamer and a fan of the ""Tales of"" series, I approached Tales of Arise with excitement and anticipation, only to be sorely disappointed by the end of my experience. Tales of Arise is a game that doesn't dare to break any boundaries, and instead, chooses to play it safe to appease the Twitter crowd. The result is a bland, uninspired story that's not worth mentioning, let alone playing through.

From the get-go, it becomes painfully obvious that the developers have taken a cautious approach when crafting the narrative, resulting in a story that feels watered-down and overly cautious. The narrative lacks depth, and it becomes clear that the game is geared towards a PG-12 audience. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that the ""Tales of"" series has a longstanding history of engaging storytelling that caters to both younger and older audiences. With Tales of Arise, the mature gamer is left feeling unfulfilled and excluded.

Furthermore, the game's graphical presentation, while initially impressive, quickly becomes overwhelming. Tales of Arise is powered by the Unreal Engine, and it's evident that the developers pushed the engine to its limits. While this results in high-quality visuals, the overabundance of particle effects quickly turns the game into a visually chaotic mess. At times, it's difficult to discern what's happening on screen, detracting from the overall experience.

The game's combat system, which should have been a redeeming quality, is unfortunately just as shallow and lackluster as the narrative. The mechanics are simplistic and fail to offer any depth or challenge, leading to monotonous gameplay. The flashy particle effects do little to mask the shallow nature of the combat, and ultimately, the battles feel like a missed opportunity.

In conclusion, Tales of Arise is a disappointing entry in the beloved ""Tales of"" series. With a bland, safe narrative and an overblown visual presentation, the game lacks the charm and depth that fans have come to expect from the franchise. The shallow combat system only adds to the list of grievances, resulting in an experience that isn't worth the time or money for adult gamers.",1682110185,1682110185,False,1,0,0.480480492115020752,0,True,False,False

update: I'm at the last dungeon and I'm really suffering trying to push to the ending. The characters have potential - I love their designs (Dolahim and Kisara are like the hottest characters they've ever made bruh the potential is killing me) but they're all so BORING. The skits are so bland. Yes the story is garbo, but that's usually fine in this franchise as long as the characters are good, but their interactions are so hollow and soulless. It's like watching a bunch of cardboard cutouts interact with each other. There's no conflict between them, nowhere for their relationships to grow besides Ice Queen Learning The Power Of Franship, every skit is just re-iterating the latest plot development in the most boring way possible. I feel like the sign of a Good JRPG Party is that you can choose any 2 members of the cast and they actually have some sort of relationship to each other instead of everyone only really interacting with the main character. Like they have at least some dynamic that's unique to them. This definitely ain't it. (brb dying on the hill that FF13 was great actually)

So you're telling me I have to commit to an attack when the screen is going sicko mode with the brightness, flames, ice, and special effects flying around? Sometimes I can't even see the enemy it's drowned in special effects sensory overload and when I do they're about to caught me off guard with my pant's down cause I have to commit to my attacks. 
What I said before only happens once or twice in a single battle, my biggest problem is what the lack of cancel animation does to the AI. The commitment to attack also hoed the AI and in turn it hoed me too. When it's a soft hitting enemy it's not that bad but if the enemy is an absolute unit then good luck keeping your healing items more than 0. All of my items are reduced to atoms cause the AI got targeted and can't dodge so now It's a cycle of them dying, reviving, dying, reviving.

It should be said that I am only 7 hours into the game and these are my impressions so far. If my opinions change I will either revise or delete this review.

1. Story Line - So far the story is poorly written although the concept is interesting, there are a lot of places where it doesn't make any logical sense. Dialogue is tough to sit through and is not engaging at all.  You literally spend more time in cut scenes and optional scenes then the game itself. 

2. Art - The game looks pretty good for the most part. Similar to phone games that cross platform. 

3. Game play - combat system could have been better conceived. there are a lot of things that are left unknown to you in terms of determining quality of abilities, Damage and timing. The game world is very linear and straight forward. Even ""secrets"" aren't really hidden. Encounters are not random and as such will require you to grind to catch up if you skip things. The crafting system is trash.

Ultimately the game could have been much better. Half the reviews i've read don't actually seem to have played the game, even if there are hundreds of hours ""Played"". Play this game if you want to watch a graphic novel with a poorly executed story line in which you make no choices that further the story and the entire game is predetermined and highly controlled.

Going into this game i Knew nothing of the Tales Of faranchise but now i very muvh plan on playing the other games.

If you are on the fence about this game , trust me and give it a try it is fucking awesome!

and if you cant take my word for it ill touch on a few points though im not fully through the game yet!


First off the combat is very smooth but its different enough from most games to feel refreshing and non repetitive , the amount of different attacks you can use are insane if you get bored with one loadout just try a few new moves and learn new combos!

secondly the graphics are gourgeous , i didnt know how beutiful this game would actually be not to mention the flashiness of the attacks!

and lastly though im not through all the games story yet its soooo good so far, its a slow burn early on but once you get into it its rocking all the way!

one criticism is that you need to do the side quest and crafting new gear. if you dont you will be under leveled and underpowerd. its not impossible to do without the sidequests but if you dont want to feel super annoyed during bossfights make sure to do the side quests . plus a few are kinda neat.


all in all this game gets a 9/10 for me and could very  well become a ten depending how the rest of it goes.

The combat system, combo patterns, all felt great, but it falls flat when it comes to the system's 'stumble prevention' nature. The enemies stumble mechanics from combo-ing is very frustrating, because it does not allow for long combos that 'punish' their mistakes. It basically forces a back and forth; after you finish a simple combo, you are literally FORCED to dodge their attack, because they become NIGH IMPOSSIBLE to stumble again until AFTER their attack. Obviously, it's easy to dodge when you realise that this pattern is present for EVERY ENEMY, and it just becomes an extremely boring back and forth with no rewards given trying to min-max since you'll just get punished for not dodging lol. Did I mention that the variety of mob enemies can be counted with two hands?

Characters - 3/10 
The characters are flat. The issues they have are always the same, and the way they resolve it is ridiculous. They only ever developed in character over 1 thing, making it extremely boring to see. 1 or 2 characters don't even develop in my opinion i.e. Dohalim, Kisara. and Law. They just went from bad guys to good guys and ever since then is the same. The interactions or dialogues between the characters are childish, only ever pushing idealism with no sense of realism and consequence. What really sticks out like a sore thumb is how uncharacteristic their personality really truly is. Yes, they have some quirky behavior but that really is about it; there is nothing more in-depth about them.

Plot and Writing: 10/10, 0/10
The idea and the world of the plot is good. Yes it is commonplace, but it is still highly appreciated. I give this a 10/10 in plot because i really want to bring out the massive difference it has over the writing/portrayal/idea of the plot. Dear God (mind you i'm not religious), it was so difficult to sit through the dialogues and cutscenes from the level of ridiculousness that is happening.

Tales of Arise, if you've played the Demo, feels so fun to play. But getting up to that point, i.e., the early game, is such a grueling experience. Tales of Berseria, for example, had me enjoying its combat system from the get-go; even without Velvet's OP Soul Arte and generally just fighting the weaker mobs found in the early areas. Because the combat is smooth and enjoyable.

Tales of Arise feels like they tried to mix in the methodical gameplay of a souls-like to their anime JRPG combat system that you can find from prior games. What resulted from that mix is a game that tells you to build up your combo and perform crazy ability chains, but with enemy designs that scream ""wait for the right timing and play it methodically"". You can't give me two opposing gameplay ideas in one go.

Even though I play games 60% because of their stories, and I got this game on a 60% sale, having to withstand this awful combat system for more than 40 hours just to see a mediocre storyline isn't worth my time and money. I really wanted to enjoy the game, but the combat ain't just doing it for me.

If you're a fan of the Tales series, this is definitely a game you would want to pick up. It has that Tales formula that probably what made you love the franchise in the first place. If you're like me that has played only a couple of them (I've played both Tales of Destiny on the PS1 and Tales of Berseria), or are new to the franchise, it'll probably be a hit or miss, especially if you're looking for a combat system similar to Berseria.",1681385144,1681385144,False,5,2,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Personally, the characters were good, story though unoriginal is also okay, BUT as a jrpg the bread and butter of this genre is the way they tell their story aka pacing and UNFORTUNATELY tales of arise is so bad at it. Now i'm not saying this is a bad game, in fact, i felt that during the start this game was a solid 8.5/10 and then it went bad down the road. When people ask me my thoughts on this game, I always compare it to Naruto. Naruto was interesting until Sasuke left Konoha and everything in between until Shippuden were fillers. Much the same, Arise started out really well but in the middle, they kind of strayed and then started padding the story to the point that the ending felt too rushed and all i wanted was to just get it over with, sadly.

I just finished this game. Clocked in at about 76 hours. With doing most side quests. Haven't touched on any post game content yet. But I really recommend this game. This was a fantastic game. It's not without it's faults. The pacing between story beats can be slow sometimes, there was certain plot points that just left me with a ""Why did you just do that"" feeling, and then some of the characters are a little tropey. But I think overall the package is fantastic and nothing that really pulls away from the overall experience of the game

The combat is fantastic and addicting, there was never a time I dodged out of combat other than maybe to conserve healing/restorative items while dungeoning. The characters while I mentioned were tropey I grew to absolutely love. Tales games are usually renowned for their good characters, while only playing this one and Tales of Symphonia I can say that so far in my experience this is true. I don't think I like some of the characters as much as some from Symphonia but I do love all their interactions together and towards the end it really felt like they were a super cohesive family/friend group. It was fun seeing their interactions. And seeing all the skits. Although the skits are dispersed a little unevenly. There will be times where I get 3 or 4 skits at a time. I was compelled to watch them when I saw them, but there was a lot at once sometimes. 

But keeping that all in mind, if you're looking for a really good time with combat, learning and meeting new characters and seeing their interactions and bonding with them, and also goofing around and dressing them in goofy outfits like bunny pig gloves then I totally recommend this game.

Enough time to build up and make you interested to listen to their stories as well as the dialogue in cut scenes. Overall an amazing game better than most JRPG games.

The combat for me was good and relaxing but I prefer combat gameplay such as Dark Souls or For Honor.  The positive side is this was prefect for me to retreat to from PVP and technically stressful. The combat didn't matter to me as much because I was immersed from the story. Excellent game!

I really like the characters even though they were inconsistent. In one scene they are banding together and connecting then ten minutes later they are disagreeing and getting upset with each other.

When all is said and done - I did enjoy this game, the world, and the story arch. The graphics are beautiful and the combat is pretty fun!

(This review is my personal opinion on this game and the experience i had with it)

As a classic tales fan who started with the symphonia duology this game feels like a major step up in game/series direction aiming to be more main stream with its story and writing complementing with its wonderful animation along side its smooth and buttery combat mechanics makes it one of the more friendlier tales of games to get into albeit it may differ a lot to older tales of games especially in combat it still serves as a great entry game to the series in my opinion despite the slow pacing of the story while only kicking things on full throttle on the latter part of the game. 

Pros
-For full marks on Character Design and Animations
-Playable characters with different play styles to try out
-Difficulty and uniqueness of each Mob brings to the table each fight
-BEST FISHING MINI GAME

Cons
-No major hook that i can remember 
-The only good and memorable writing the game has is on its skits (not saying skits are bad but if the game has to rely solely on this feature that smells worry some for future installments) 
-It felt like there are things they wanted to do more but weren’t able to and things that could have been executed more effectively and because of this it would create awkward and questionable moments.

Overall Ill give the game a  7/10

Would recommend to someone who wants a modern gateway entry series to the franchise.",1680817908,1680817908,True,1,0,0.510489523410797119,0,True,False,False

Graphically it's one of the better looking anime games out there. It sticks true to the anime art style while still looking gorgeous. Particle effects, colors, lights, galore. It's an eccentric  firework show on a masterful watercolor painting.

Music is done very well, each track gets a solid grasp of the feeling the area you are in is trying to evoke. The intro music is also especially well made, feels like it comes straight out of a popular high budget anime. 

Gameplay is very fun but this is mostly carried by the diverse move-sets and flashy effects on screen. There are some drawbacks, once you get used to the same kind of enemy it becomes a slog. And this game really does like to re-use enemies. You'll fight a wolf, then you'll fight a wolf in blue, then in green, then in red, and so on. But these fights usually take a good bit to complete and they start to feel like padding. Towards the end this gets REALLY bad, like I had to just take a break bad. The enemies get really big health bars and they're just repetitive back to back appearances. Furthermore, there's a problem in this game where since there are so many lights and colors it is hard at times to understand what is your ability and what is the enemies damaging ability. As a result, combat at times feels like a fight against a punching bag that will at random swing back and smack you. Combat leaves a lot to be desired but it is serviceable, it does however, get tiring when it's repetitive. 

Story is one of the main draw-ins of this game. While it has sort of a corny trope filled plot, at many times it does have some unique elements. I will say although the tropes do exist it is refreshing to see how bold-faced the game feels as it uses them. Sometimes you just have to embrace the anime tropes and have fun. This game definitely has that. Yet, aside from the baseline story you have some exceptional characters interacting with one another as the game goes on. There's a sort of nuanced banter that this game has that makes you laugh along like you the player are part of the group, or well the quiet friend that sits off to the side that enjoys everyone else just having a good time. 

I have some other complaints such as this game having quite limited mag design and often annoying obstacles and weird puzzles where you have to come back at specific points of the game. I don't like any of that stuff.

If this game had a more responsive and easier to read combat system with more diverse enemies mechanically and visually it would definitely have left a better impression on me. But as it stands there are enough positive aspects to warrant a positive review.

As it stands now I give tales of arise a 7/10, if they did the same game but with better combat say for example FFXV or FFVII remake which I have more experience with in the realm of JRPG. I would probably give this a 8.5. There are still things it leaves to be desired.",1680742640,1680742640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all graphics and cutscenes are simply beautiful, there are a bunch of different regions and they all look stunning and game is really consistent from start to finish when it comes to graphics. 

Combat is also a lot of fun, it took me some time to get used to it but once I did it felt so satisfying making combos, also a big plus is that I never got tired of it during my whole playthrough so when it's comes to combat it's really consistent and fun!

Story is also masterfully done, it revolves around slavery, overcoming your past and becoming a better person, it's really good and it will definitely keep you interested till the very end.

Strongest point of the game however is definitely it's character development, as you play the game you'll get to know each member of your party more and more, and seeing them grow so much during the course of the game is definitely my favorite part of the game. As for antagonist they are also interesting and well designed.

The shortcomings: The story is good, not great. The plot and bare-bone story itself is good, but the way the dialogues are presented, and the character progression are not inspired in any way. Very few reviews seemed to point this out, the conversations between the characters are mostly pointless, they revolve around their past problems with no solutions, just plain sympathetic acknowledgments. I wish the skits were half as good as Tales of Berseria.  The side quests are a chore, thank god for the easy-to-use fast travel.

The good stuff: Apart from the tsundere anime heroine, the game has good combat. But the more good stuff is locked by DLCs (Shame Bandai Namco). The graphics have come up a long way from the last Tales of Berseria. Every town or realm has its unique charm. The RPG mechanics are good like ""Character Relations, Cooking, Farming, Crafting"". The music is decent and some skits have some good light-hearted comedy.

-The gameplay can be fun even if most mechanics are useless
-Gameworld looks nice and the biomes are varied
-What some characters go through are quite meaningful and can really resonate with you at times
-There are a lot of lighthearted moments in the game which are pretty funny. There can be quite a bit of drama between the characters too.

Cons
-Way too much pointless dialogue. About 70% of the skits in this game are just the characters repeating what has been said in the cutscene earlier, or just asking nonsensical questions. The questions don't matter because the characters know nothing so they're like a pack of blind mice. Personal problems that are resolved in one scene can be brought up a few hours later. The exact same problem.

-Characters are wildly inconsistent. Their lifelong views can be changed in an instant in some cutscene, and yet several hours later they just revert back to their original selves. At the end of the game you truly wonder if any of the characters have changed at all.

-Lore makes no sense. Renans are this super advanced race with space travel and teleporters, and yet they are using metal swords and have wolves as servants instead of, say, drones.

-Many combat design decisions don't make sense. What is the point of having 100 artes when only a few are the best and the others all suck? Furthermore the game doesn't give you any damage info so you have to test each arte by yourself. Also the combo system is completely pointless since they don't matter for bosses anyway. 

-All of the NPCs' dialogues are pointless as well so don't bother wasting your time talking to them.

-The entire 2nd half of this game is an exposition dump and it's executed in the worse way possible. You load into an area, there's a cutscene. 2 more optional cutscenes after the initial cutscene. Then you literally walk a few steps into....guess what? Another cutscene! And look at this....there's yet another optional cutscene after that!

     I believe that alone should be enough to make everyone try the game, but in case you want to read more, then kindly read what I thought after playing the game. I’ll try my best to make it spoiler free.

[b][u]1. Story & Characters – 9.5/10[/u][/b]
     Tales of series is a long running franchise that is known for their story and characters, and Tales of Arise didn’t disappoint in that regard at all. The story is quite dark as it tackles slavery and oppression, but it never gets too dark, because they were able slid in funny tropes and skits from the main characters.
     
     The 6 main characters were all portrayed amazingly, having well told backstories and progressive character development, my favorites being Rinwell and Dohalim. It definitely felt like I was travelling with them as the story progresses.
     
     The only thing I can honestly nitpick is that there are very few instances that the skits and cut scenes were occurring consecutively for a while that it felt like I’m watching an anime instead of playing a game anymore.

[b][u]2. Gameplay & Exploration – 9/10[/u][/b]
     Tales of Arise is an action RPG, and compared to all the previous Tales of games, it’s definitely the best in terms of gameplay. The gameplay was smooth and fluid, it revolves around dodging/blocking then countering the enemies to deal damage. It can be hard at first, especially if you use Alphen as he has self-damaging skills, but it was satisfying once you get the hang of it.
     
     Exploration is similar to Pokemon, where you travel around the world to gather materials and talk to NPCs, then you need to run towards the enemy to trigger a separate battle scene. It would be amazing if we can battle the enemies right away without the separate battle scene, making the map and area play bigger roles in the battles. The game doesn’t support multiplayer as well, which is a bummer for some like me.

[b][u]3. Graphics – 9.5/10[/u][/b]
     The game was built using Unreal Engine 4, with few animated cut scenes produced by Ufotable, so obviously the game has amazing visuals. The high quality is very consistent throughout the game as well, even in the DLCs. My only wish is the animated cut scenes of Ufotable have similar quality to Demon Slayer or Fate series next time, one can dream right haha.

[b][u]4. Soundtracks – 8.5/10[/u][/b]
     I love the two main tracks of the game. It will definitely feel nostalgic and give me goosebumps when I hear them 3 or more years from now. But those are honestly the only ones aside from few tracks played during Rinwell and Shionne’s emotional scenes that stuck and resonated with me.

[b][u]5. Post-game & DLC – 8/10[/u][/b]
     If you’re like me who wants to 100% complete a game, Tales of Arise has a good amount of post-game content, from finding all the owls, catching all the fish, cooking all the ingredients, watching all the skits, clearing all the sub-quest, etc. There is definitely a lot to check but it was pretty fun and quite challenging.

     The DLCs are definitely the main reason Tales of Arise has any negative review, they locked THREE skill panels on DLC, which obviously disappointed some people. The SAO DLC was surprisingly the hardest content for me in this game, but buy it when on discount please, it’s not worth it at full price.

This is my first time playing any games in this franchise, and I was extremely surprised by how fun and deep the combat and RPG systems in this game are. It's definitely not a hack and slash, you will actually need to think about what you're doing... but it's incredibly fun and action packed. I'd go so far as to say one of the best action-RPGs combat-wise. [list][/list]Everything else is at least good, great, or above average! Some really good characters and a serious story with some heavy/mature themes like slavery, tragedy, genocide, and even politics. I was pleasantly surprised by this considering the game seems marketed to a young audience. The main character, ""Iron Mask,"" is very likable with Japanese voice-acting (I wasn't a fan of English at all). He is a blank-slate slave with amnesia who rises up against his masters and really comes into his own.[list][/list]This is an extremely good game -- better than most modern AAA titles. I strongly recommend it. Skip the demo and just buy it-- it does a much better job of introducing you to the combat and overall gameplay experience in the full game.

It has since made me want to try out all the other Tales series. I'll get right to my thoughts, pros and cons.Pros:- Beautiful graphics. There are many times where I just have to stop running around to appreciate the colour and environment. Also, the amount of effort that went into cutscenes and mini-movies. Like, actual straight up anime animation?? Was not expecting that, and I was blown away by how seamless most transitions were. - Character development is amazing amongst the entire cast. Is there a lot of dialogue? Oh yes. Can you skip the majority of it? Also yes -- but your investment and emotional attachments to each character throughout the journey makes you not want to. - Combat is fun -- switching up different abilities, party team members, combos, et cetera never gets stale. It is also gorgeous to look at it. - Plot -- while there are some ""I don't quite understand whats happening"" moments forsure, the storyline is actually interesting and has kept my interest and desire to progress it throughout the entirety of the game. There may be a few plot holes here and there scattered about, but by the time they may happen you really don't care as you get lost in the world building and dialogue anyways.Cons:- Enemies, especially bosses, have LOTS of health. Like, an almost unnecessary amount of numbers. The difficulty doesn't necessarily increase, they just become more and more damage sponges. While the combat is still fun and pretty to look at, some battles can rage on for what feels like forever. - Exploration -- while I didn't hate it.. it sort of left a lot of room to be desired. Maps are very linear, and even the areas that aren't, there are only two or three at most passages you can explore before stumbling upon the loot that you are expecting to be at the end anyways. It isn't that thrilling exploring the areas, other than how beautiful they look. - Along the same vein, a lot of enemies are recycled unfortunately, as you will only see different colour or armour variations of the same enemy types within the first few hours and then the rest of the game. I think they did a great job with detailing the Lords and bosses, however, so no complaints there. This is more specifically talking about the trash mobs.Things I thought were eh:- The soundtrack, while not bad, was sort of meh. You usually end up with the same themes recycled over and over throughout the game. (This is not including the music for the animated cutscenes)- The villains themselves were practically one-dimensional. The reason I am not putting this as a con is because it makes sense world building wise, but I never really felt anything for them after defeating them. Not a bad thing, however.Overall:This game is a solid 9/10 for me. I have only done one playthrough so far, so there might be more things I think of. At the end of the day, if you like JRPGS, a thick plot, flashy combat and damn good character development where you may end up shedding an actual tear over them, this is a great game for you.

It might take some time to get used to the gameplay mechanics, especially with the battle part, because it is a little confusing. But when you get used to it, it's really a fun game to play. Each member of the party has their own roles for each type of enemies available (e.g. Shionne with flying enemies, Law with armored enemies, Dohalim with fast-paced enemies, Kisara for protection, Rinwell for canceling enemy artes, and Alphen as the overall DPS in the team). This makes the presence of each members of the party to be very important. Also, if you love exploration games, then this game is definitely for you.

For the lore:
I won't say much so I won't spoil anything. Although the story-telling is linear, it is quite good. But beware though, because this game has so many optional conversations that could sometimes be too overwhelming. Those optional conversations are sometimes about the characters talking in circles about a topic that they've discussed in the main cutscene. So if you would like to skip it, it's not much of a big deal (I don't skip it tho). The game has a balanced funny and serious moments. which makes this Tale as the one to be remembered. The character development and each of the party's relationship also continues to grow from time to time, which is also something to be enjoyed for.

For the graphics :
1. Tales of arise has so many beautiful environments for each realms, I personally loved the 3rd realm, because it has so many greens.
2. The combat animation (especially the combination attack) is visually stunning.

A generic as the story went, saving the world and whatnot, appear in like 10000 games until now. It's the sceneries, the landscapes, the characters, and the interactions that are over the top. These are the point that made this game so unique and captivating. 

Every character feels alive and related because they have their own struggle throughout the entire game, as you gonna be fed a shit ton of dialogue about that.

The story explores delicate topics around discrimination, systemic oppression, and creating a world where people can accept each other. The party will tackle these subjects, leading them to experience tremendous levels of growth throughout the game, both individually and as a team. I felt genuinely moved by these characters, both because of what they stood for and the relationships they had with each other.

TL;DR I ultimately decided to NOT recommend this game because of how disappointed I got after the first 20-30 hours of this game; right around the when you get into the Menancia story. Gameplay got stale and tedious, Story and its pacing got really bad, less creative and felt super linear. I compare this to the other Tales games and I have never experienced such disappointment in the franchise before. 

[h2][u]Pricing[/u][/h2]
At $60, I legitimately think it isn't worth it. I'd say if you got the game for $20 - $30, It's worth a buy.

[h2][u]Graphics, Performance, PC Port/Localization[/u][/h2]
[b]PROS:[/b]
- Graphics are really nice at the highest settings because of the art-style. The pastel art-style works so well on the environment and characters which make it pretty unique compared to other games.
[b]CONS:[/b]
- I think a lot of my performance issues came from the sub-par PC port of the game. There are two main examples of this. First are the Boost Strike and Mystic Arte cutscenes. My 120-144 fps would immediately go to 60 fps because it was locked to those frames during that mechanic. The second example are cinematic cutscenes. They lock to 30 fps. It just looks so bad on my monitor and the cutscenes don't look smooth at all.
- Controller support is kinda wack. If you use an xbox controller, it'll show PS Dualshock controls/prompts. If you use an PS Dualshock controller, it'll show keyboard controls/prompts. Why couldn't they just have controls/prompts based on what your using at that time. This was so annoying to deal with. 
- I played with Japanese VA w/ English subtitles. Localization wasn't all that bad. I know how to speak, listen, and read in Japanese. That aspect I didn't have a problem with as the localized translations weren't all that bad. But the nuances of acting of the characters like the body acting and speaking felt so weird. Everything is over exaggerated.  It's VERY similar to live acting in musicals (like broadway acting), which does not fit in video games at all.

[h2][u]Game Gameplay/Mechanics[/u][/h2]
[b]PROS:[/b]
This is a step up from the previous Tales 2D-3D hybrid mechanics. It's overall pretty fun! 
- The action was very engaging. If you're like me and like fast paced fights, you'll like how everything flows. There are enough different fighting styles between the characters which each are very interesting.
- Unlocking skills is much nicer compared to other Tales games as well. You still get the random unlocks when fighting enemies, but you can also unlock skills and attributes. 
- Enemy weaknesses were self explanatory and didn't need that much thinking; the game makes it pretty clear.
- Fishing minigame is fun
- Skits are a very strong point of the game. They improved them aesthetically, making them like a manga which is a nice touch. They provide nice charm to the game.
[b]CONS:[/b]
- There were way too way many skills/attributes to unlock based on the game length. I had an in-game time of 85 hours, did most of the side quests (only didn't do the last 3, which are post-game), was at lvl 60 and didn't really get close to getting all the skills within the game for all the characters. 
- The unlocked (2nd) Mystic Artes mechanic where you had to have a 5+ artes combo to activate it was really bad and finicky. Sometimes it wouldn't activate after clearly getting way above the combo threshold. 
- Enemy diversity is non-existent. Even the bosses didn't have much to them. After the first TYPE of enemy/ boss you encounter, you can pretty much expect a re-skinned enemy or boss later in the game.
- AI are so dumb and some times you have to micromanage them. Whenever certain characters, mainly [spoiler]Law and Kisara[/spoiler] get low on HP (or not even low on HP), they wouldn't attack at all until I fully get them healed up. Even with custom commands, some characters won't revive and continue casting offensive artes even if a character was down.
- Gameplay after Elde Menancia got so tedious and grindy. You were never around the same level during any of the areas. Sub quest bosses were way too highly leveled. This is where the pacing got so bad and I just wanted to finish the game ASAP so I didn't have to experience going through it again.

[h2][u]Story[/u][/h2]
I won't have pros and cons section for this because this was the biggest disappointment to me from this game. IT WAS REALLY GOOD THE FIRST 20-30 HOURS. The environment of Calgia and Cyslodia were really cool. I really loved the settings of these areas and how the liberation plot of these areas were conducted. The story took a steep dive mainly in the middle of Menancia. The story got linear and obvious to the point of insanity. New characters introduced weren't interesting. Antagonists were just there for the sake of being antagonists. Didn't help that the main characters felt like they were over reacting to every little plot point. [spoiler]Vholran[/spoiler] is such a bad character. [spoiler]I thought that he would be an interesting mysterious character after the first fight he gave. No. He was just a psycho that didn't go away in the story and provided no significant value to the story other than being a weird twist that wouldn't go away.[/spoiler] Probably the worst part was the pacing. Everything that was grand in scale just happened in a short period of time. You go to places so fast to the point where you question what the point of that area was other than you just had to go there for the sake of the pacing of the story. The ending itself was just stupid. At that point you didn't care what happened because it felt like there was no sense of urgency from the characters and those around them.

The normal combat is alright, although AI can't be bothered not to use attacks with attributes enemies are resistant against, so if you play above normal difficulty there is a lot of micromanagement added. There also isn't any sort of profiles or anything to save up ""builds"" so good luck clicking all those checkboxes every time you wanna optimize against a different category of enemies.

Boss fights are terrible. Very scripted and introduces AoE attacks the AI is too stupid to avoid. They just stand there, die and force you to use items to revive them. Some characters have healing and reviving skills but despite a tactic system (priority action list, what to do based on certain criteria) ordering them to focus on healing they often ignore it. There is also an occasional stunlock where you lose all HP or revive and instantly die again if you are in the wrong place or get hit by an enemy outside of the camera view. More common in boss battles.

The main plot heavily uses cutscenes, half of which are impossible to speed up or skip individual lines. Some events also turn into anime videos which feel off, since the art style differs somewhat from the game proper. Very annoying when you just want to play but are forced into watching some naive, badly written PG-13 plot about the power of friendship, the goodness of stuff, and monologues of various boring characters.

At some point, the game does something inexcusable, for an entire arc (except for pre-boss fight and boss fight) nerfs your main character, blocks quick travel outside of a small region, and removes the main healer from your party. Drastic spike of difficulty for just some plot reason and locks you out of finishing various sidequests until you complete the arc. It occurs at an unexpected moment so you can't prepare for that.

The economy in the game is. And that's all. There is an easy source of infinite money from fishing, but it's boring. Money is as plentiful as the ways to spend it since the game constantly offers you various insignificant upgrades. Not much in terms of progression, equipment-wise the only difference is some small numerical improvement, and switching to new gear isn't reflected in any way, since most items don't even have in-game-graphic. There are many skills you unlock and can combo into one another but since most characters are tied to certain affinities like fire and can't swap skills to optimize against enemies there isn't much to this part of the progression either, except for different visuals and slightly higher damage numbers. There is no feeling of any importance to building up character, as there is no numbers attached to skills and it appears to me there will be enough skills points to max out everything. There is no much in terms of builds, except for min-maxing accessory composition, which has clear Best-in-slot items.

Not sure whether it's part of the genre but the game feels like ported from RPG Maker, very oldschool but not in a good way. Everything is 3D and in real-time, but the core mechanics, chests with more or less useful items, touching enemy transporting you into a locked-out arena to fight, is unchanged from games twenty years old.

First of all, the graphics are simply breathtaking. The world is so detailed and beautiful that you'll feel like you're actually exploring a living, breathing fantasy realm. And the characters? They're so well-designed and animated that you'll quickly become attached to them and their stories.

But what really sets Tales of Arise apart is the combat. It's fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. You'll control a team of characters with unique abilities and work together to take down all kinds of enemies, from giant beasts to powerful bosses. And the special moves? They're like something out of a martial arts movie, with flashy animations and devastating effects.

And the story? It's an epic tale of rebellion and redemption, filled with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll explore a world torn apart by war and political intrigue, and you'll meet all kinds of characters along the way, each with their own motivations and agendas.

Now, I will say that the game can be a bit challenging at times. You'll need to pay close attention to your party's abilities and work together if you want to come out on top. But that's what makes it so rewarding when you finally defeat a tough enemy and see your characters grow stronger.

All in all, Tales of Arise is a game that I highly recommend. It's got everything you could want in a fantasy RPG - gorgeous graphics, engaging gameplay, and a gripping story.

Battle system is the typical arena battle but with more fluidity than other entries. Air combos and dodges as well as double jumping are a thing. Special attacks etc. are flashy but don't take up too much time. However, battles seem to be longer than previous entries.

No open map as usual, but areas are unique and it still feels like a fun journey going through them. Certain areas have event text where it might be typically unexpected keeping it fun.

Story is great - nothing else to say here.

Some titles (meaning abilities and enhancements) are locked behind DLC, to get them all you're looking at a decent amount extra to invest. These aren't necessary to beat the game though. One worth getting would be the Warring states (male) for a certain healing spell for a character which is pretty OP.

740130,118248819,76561198056683029,0,32,2153,0,2153,1659359562,"The game is simply way too overpriced (SGD80) for the quality of content it offers. This is primarily a linear game which is not inherently a bad thing since certain non-linear games may as well be linear with the quality on offer. In particular, the second portion of the game feels extremely drawn out and there are also egregious non-cosmetic microtransactions in this singleplayer game. I will start with what I do like about the game.

There is an abundance of voiced character dialogue. For example, there is a particularly tall waterfall where multiple party members will react to if you decide to jump. The characters in your party are well-developed and have believable motivations. The art never really got old for me and I had no performance issues. I also appreciate the anime cutscenes although they are extremely limited in number. Every now and then you get skits which takes the form of a comic book/manga and fleshes out each character although you might find the frequency tedious but I enjoy such narrative story telling elements. I also did not encounter any game breaking bug.

The story is not as well thought out as the likes of divinity original sin 2, pathfinder: WOTR or the Witcher 3 but it is nuanced enough in some areas to be enjoyable, with some character deaths feeling very contrived for shock value. Certain characters are poorly done like the villains which are very much one-dimensional. For instance, the fifth lord's motivations were too edgy, even for an anime.

Now for the negatives. When playing on normal, you will always be underleveled for the chapter's boss even if you complete every side quest available to you. This is exacerbated by the sharp difficulty contrast between bosses and trash mobs which populate 90% of the game. The latter are just punching bags while the former actually forces you to use potions if you don't dodge every single hit. Therefore, the player can either grind levels by defeating the same filler monsters over and over again or one can use one's credit card for level boosters. There should not be any microtransactions in a single player game, especially if one is paying for ""convenience"" and not new assets. 

The currency used to buy potions is also pretty limited early on which again incentivises the player to visit the cash shop. Moreover, your AI companions are prone to taking damage which forces you to either let them die and solo the boss yourself or continually waste healing potions on them.

The side quests in the game are unfortunately more of a quantity over quality thing. There are different options that give the player the illusion of choice but in reality lead to the same outcome. 

The environment looks pretty but also feels lifeless at the same time.  Reloading into the same map magically re-spawns the monsters that you just slew and in the exact same spot. The game wants you to fight the same monsters over and over again to artificially extend the playtime of the game. The biggest immersion breaking factor would probably be how you have to load into combat. When encountering enemies, you trigger the combat by being near them and then you load into a separate instance of the game where your movement is restricted to a small arena. You are only able to see your party members during combat. When combat finishes, you are alone exploring the map again which limits interaction with them. This is by far the most puzzling aspect of JRPGs to me, how they magically appear only during combat but not exploration.

Monster variety is also extremely lacking. You will fight the same filler monsters but with a different coat of paint over and over again. After awhile this just becomes a chore especially when levels are filled to the brim with these filler monsters. 

I conclude this review with a few minor complaints. The controls on PC are a little strange. Usually tab is used to target but here you have to hold left alt. Esc doesn't bring up quit game, instead tab does. All in all, I will only get this without a sale if you really appreciate the anime-esque art style. Otherwise, in hindsight I would get this on a 60% sale or better.

Not only do the characters feel alive, but the graphics and fast paced action are also quite impressive. The story really made me want to sit on the edge of my seat, and made me want to keep playing to find out what happens next. 

Not only is the story emotional and well thought out, it is ambitious. There were so many times in the game that I legitimately went  "" Wow! this game is crazy/awesome ""  The game also has so many twists and turns in it, so of which very few people would be able to see coming. Besides the main story, the game has quite a few side quests, but not enough for you to get overwhelmed. I have played other JRPGs that have so many side quests that it seems half the game is made out of them. Well fear not because this game has a healthy amount of side quests. 

This game does some grinding to it though. But I mean you are playing a JRPG so keep that in mind. the game's true combat comes later in the game, making the beginning of the game's combat system seem quite bare bones. but after you get playing it for a bit the game introduces more of the combat system. The game's graphics are also quite impressive, with large worlds to explore.

Over all I would say that this game is a 9/10 or a even a 10/10. Do note that I have never played a "" Tales "" game before, so I might have missed so Easter eggs through the game if there were any. but it means you play it without any other "" Tales "" game experience.  I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of story, impressively in depth characters, and fast paced combat.

Visually, the game is pretty nice! It's very Unreal Engine looking, but the stylized art style works well. There's some issues with muddy visuals in some scenes (especially on Steam Deck) and the frame rate consistency can be rough at times during combat.

Audio wise - nothing to complain about. Voice acting is acceptable and at some times is fairly good. Combat sounds are good, apart from the insane amount of chatter during combat (which is par for the course in this kind of game).

Controls wise... I wish you could dodge out of animations. The game buffers inputs, so if I accidentally hit ""X"" twice, it'll do the move assigned to X twice and it's hard to get out of it. Really punishes you if you get stuck in one of the longer combat animations.

Using other characters during combat (especially their combat trials) highlights how unwieldy the combat can be. It's annoying controlling them and performing their moves. It's probably the worst part of the game.

- The ""P2W"" items are actually ""Pay 2 remove fun"", since they make the game too easy.
- The story is par for the course for a JRPG, but the characters are developed fairly well.
- Combat starts out extremely fun, but there are some annoying mechanics involved, a bit too much visual clutter with spells flying everywhere, and end-game being boring once you've figured out the ""optimal"" damage-dealing combo.
- The translation is quite bad; it seemed to focus more on localising for an American audience than translating what is actually being said.

Note: I 100%ed the game (yes, even collecting all 500 items and viewing all 320 skits) in around 107 hours on Hard difficulty exclusively. This review will be mostly about things I disliked about the game, but you should interpret that as me liking everything else about it.

[h2] Microtransactions [/h2]
If you've seen some of the other reviews, you'd notice that many people are complaining about the microtransactions in this game. In general, I disapprove of the practice. Predatory games like Genshin Impact abuse negative reinforcement by making certain elements of their game so frustrating that players feel like they have to pay to progress. Tales of Arise is not one of those games.

As someone who bought the Ultimate Edition, I actually withheld redeeming even a single item - even the costumes - because I quickly noticed how easy they would make the game. As I sit here with my 100% file, every single piece of DLC still remains unclaimed - and I enjoyed the game more because of that.

Experience gain is not an issue, since the game massively increases your EXP gain when you defeat an enemy that is higher level than you. SP gain might seem to be an issue at first, but I was able to unlock abilities at a steady pace, maxing out the skill tree for my last character as I completed the final side quest. Material grinding is not a problem either, since you would generally get the materials needed to craft your next tier of items by just defeating all the monsters in an area - AKA what you'd do anyway.

Unless you're a really busy person who doesn't have the time to even grind an area once or twice, you really shouldn't purchase any of the DLC. Tales of Arise isn't one of those games where they build the full game then take away bits of it later to resell to you. They've clearly designed the game without the DLCs in mind, then were told by the execs to slap on some ""P2W"" items because money.

And yes, this applies to the DLC skill nodes as well. Each character has weaknesses, and those skills seem to eliminate that weakness (e.g. Giving a Water attack to someone who doesn't have one; giving an AoE heal to the healer who is good at single-target healing). Others just make numbers bigger. You can effectively achieve the same effect of purchasing the DLCs by just decreasing the difficulty level.

I feel like this is going to be controversial, so I'm leaving comments open to hearing arguments more complex than ""mIcRoTrAnSaCtIoNs bAd"".

[h2] Story [/h2]
The plot is average for a JRPG. Nothing spectacular. The foreshadowing they included was kinda nice, though.

The characters are interesting, each with their special quirks and some with nice character arcs. This is reflected in in-combat quips and camping interactions, which is neat. There is also a cute owlet, which is super neat.

The side quests are (mostly) nothing too special by themselves, but each of them is an opportunity to learn more about the characters and see how they would behave in various unique situations.

The world building is spectacular for the first few realms of this game, which then takes a sudden nosedive mid-way through. It picks up a little near the end, but it feels like they rushed everything past you assembling your whole party.

[h2] Combat [/h2]
The way you can weave your moves together is extremely fun, and the way you have to utilise specific moves to counter the enemies adds a nice layer of strategy to the game. Some gripes, though:

- Certain enemies possess AoE damage moves with no tells (i.e. roaring). Imagine Bazelgeuse from Monster Hunter roaring at you, except it chunks 60% of your HP and stuns you if you're near it.
- A few boss fights feature very annoying adds that are super tanky and stunlock you.
- Visual clutter becomes an issue once you pick up more party members. This makes it hard for you to see certain bosses' moves to avoid them. This gets exacerbated once your mages learn spells that summon a natural disaster to the field and your eyes.

Another issue is that you unlock your second Arte set relatively late into the game (holding RT in conjunction with pressing Y, X, or A for the Xbox controller for 3 additional Artes). This has a few issues. First, you're basically forced out of playing the healing character, since you have the choice of a) having only 1 or 2 offensive moves on the field or b) having to go into the menu every time you want to heal someone. Next, you'd need to redo your control mappings (if you've changed them) and relearn muscle memory relatively deep into the game. I think it was unlocked fairly early in Berseria, so I don't know why they felt the need to withhold it here.

Finally, later on in the game, enemies get really tanky (at least on Hard difficulty). This becomes an issue, since the optimal way to play is no longer to weave together Artes to stagger and stunlock your enemy enough to execute them, all while paying attention to the rest of the battlefield. It's to do something really boring, which I will be hiding in spoiler tags: [spoiler] Sacrifice all your HP to release a Blazing Sword attack that deals more damage than everything else in the game. Go into the menu to force your healers to heal you. Roll around until your HP is nearly full. Repeat. [/spoiler]

[h2] Translation [/h2]
Note: Played with JP voice and EN text.

Often, there is a tough decision to make when adding translations to Japanese games like these: translate or localise? Translating would mean trying to convey what is being said or written as accurately as possible between two very dissimilar languages. Localising would mean trying to convey the general feeling - or to reinvent it altogether.

Tales of Arise chose the second option and it... doesn't do it very well. As someone who understands most of the Japanese that's being said, it's like the team had the decision between a) translating what is being said and b) spamming one-liners you'd find from a C tier Netflix original that gets cancelled after one season and decided to go with b.

Very few games manage localising well, with Pokémon and Devil May Cry being chief among them. In those games, you feel like you're getting a different but equally amazing experience in English. Here, it's like a worse version of the original.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
The game is very fun, and the characters are well-developed with believable arcs. There are complaints to be had, but the microtransactions in this specific game should not be one of them.",1632376946,1677455409,True,2,0,0.52649003267288208,0,True,False,False

The voice acting is great in either English or Japanese, and to me had a certain coziness to it. There's a bit of character customization with different costumes, accessories, which can make cut scenes pretty funny. 

But for a game made in the past 2 years, I didn't find it that impressive in terms of game design:

1. The world feels small and linear, with most locations having very little depth, and some of them being revisited, in what is a kind of disappointing repetition. I almost felt like I was playing a ps2 game with ps5 graphics in terms of level and town design - where as I was expecting a more...modern iteration of this series. Towns are just passive hallways to walk through, with very few interactions. Think more 'towns from Oblivion' and less 'Novigrad from Witcher 3', which feels alive.

The story is honestly just okay, it's not that sophisticated and I think based on reviews it's quite overrated. A lot of the dialogue is hammy, and the serious thematic scenes read very 'young adult' to me.

The combat is fun for the first 10-15 hours. It's flashy, fast paced and at first feels like it has a lot of depth. But at some point, you realize that:
a. new maneuvers and all enemies feel the same
b. some enemies and bosses are a literal grind to kill

It became tiresome to me when I wanted to advance the story, but repeatedly couldn't kite an enemy and was forced into a 10 minute battle. The combat didn't become more challenging, it just became longer. The leveling system rewarded you for using the same techniques over and over, which sucks when most of the leveling was unlocking new techniques that, other than style, don't really change combat for you anyway. It's just a different combo to mash. Also, the equipment/crafting/cooking system was basic. Armor and weapons just scale you to the difficulty of your enemies, and other equipment just wasn't rewarding to craft. Cooking is very straight forward, and while it provides benefits, it again just doesn't feel satisfying. 

There are no puzzles in this game, at least up to about half way through, which for this game made dungeons boring because they're very simplistic otherwise. This game feels very style-over-substance to me, and I quit playing after just about 40 hours. 

If you can turn your brain off, and love pretty button mashers with high HP enemies - this is going to be a great game for you. If you play for story and system depth, I'm not sure I'd recommend this.

Let's start with what I hated, surprisingly, there wasn't anything in the story itself that I hated, what my main hate for this game was the fact that I shared a CP pool with the entirety of the party, this is like battle mechanic and outside interactions whatnot. Though I see what it is that they wanted to do, it was still absolutely a pain in the fucking ass to have. AND THEN!!! They made the fucking Orange Gels, Pineapple Gels, and Melon Gels EXPENSIVE!!! THIS PART OF THE GAME MECHANICALLY I ABSOLUTELY DESPISED!!! TALES, NEVER DO IT AGAIN!!! 

Now moving on from the hate, to the mediocre, just like, what felt okay for the most part, it took me a while to get attached to the characters of this cast. The main cast I mean, I found myself enjoying a lot of the side characters more then the main cast for a little while. But that absolutely changed when the story continued to progress, along with seen the little side quests and chats, definitely have to dedicate time and effort into the game to grow to enjoy it in my opinion. Because the characters themselves show the ugly parts immediately, which from a story perspective I enjoy it. But definitely not a ""love at first sight"" kind of cast.

Onto the story itself, it was enjoyable, it definitely evolved into something way greater then I had expected. It had quite a few plot points that I ABSOLUTELY was not expecting. I didn't feel like anything was forced into it, all felt naturally into the bigger puzzle picture, and I gotta say, the ending satisfied me. I haven't had a satisfying ending since Tales of Symphonia, Berseria is a prequel to Zestiria, so it's story doesn't end till Zestiria ends and I have my grievances against Zestiria if you've talked to me before you know. Anyways, I won't go into it, the whole point is, that I enjoyed it for what it was.

So in conclusion, I give Tales of Arise a 8 out of 10, and I definitely would recommend it to my friends or anyone who would be interested in playing it. It is not my all time favorite, unfortunately it can't top Tales of Symphonia for me, I hold that game too close to my heart. But that doesn't make Tales of Arise a bad game, it is a good game, extremely fun, maybe a tear jerker for some people, it definitely pull at my own heartstrings a little bit but didn't make me cry.

There's no way I can fight something that has 80k health when I'm doing chip damage to something that instantly kills me every time it farts. 

The bosses in general are just bullet sponges that drag on way too long. Generic fights are actually quite good once you find a combo that works for you, but the bosses try to be ""challenging"" by just having such high stats that all the mechanics you've learned just don't apply anymore. The second Lord had an attack that would almost one shot the whole party, and the only way to stop it is to kill all 3 of his clones. Even going all out (i.e. every boost attack and having the whole party focus 1 target), I was only able to BARELY kill 2 of the clones and didn't get to start on the third.

The lack of dodge cancel is just absurd for a game where a single arte can be 12 hit combos. The enemy can have enough time to make a waffle, eat it, come back, and still have time to get a free hit against me because I'm still in the middle of an attack I hit a single button for.

And don't even get me started on the mess that is CP combined with Alphen thinking his health pool is infinite. Alphens main gimmick does far more damage to himself than to the enemies. Which is terrible when combined with a resource the whole party shares that limits your healing between rests. Said resource can also be restored with orange gels which cost 1500 gald, but I can't farm gald as far as I can tell because enemies don't drop it, or it's just so slow to find sellable commodities that I still have no interest in doing so.

I swear the absurd difficulty spikes and resource issues weren't made to provide a challenge, but to drive people to buy the awful power ups Bandai calls DLC. I mean it, the design is about microtransactions instead of making an actually good game. They create a problem to sell a solution, but I have a better solution : play something else!

78 hours to get all achievements, not bad for a JRPG. It pales in comparison to earlier entries in the series though, but I'm getting ahead of myself. In short:

The good:
Story, worldbuilding
Combat
Music
Graphics

The neutral:
Postgame
Sidequests

The bad:
Boost strike animations
CP

Things:
Fishing
Difficulty and grinding

[h2]Story and worldbuilding[/h2]
This game managed to do something amazing: it made me feel like the story was going quite fast, while in reality it dragged out my playtime to levels expected of a good JRPG. The story revolves around Alphen, Shionne and a party of rebels on a murder spree to kill all of the Renan Lords. Like other Tales games, the story is very much character-driven, rather than plot-driven. It takes some getting used to the more animated skits and some are definitely on the long side, but they do what they are supposed to. The main story is written well, and it managed to keep dragging me in throughout the entirety due to the many layers that were hidden beneath the surface.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
Judging only by combat this is not a Tales game, as a single change makes the entire combat feel different from its predecessors: you cannot guard. For those that have never played a Tales game (go do so!), the combat is a real-time battle system where your characters walk around and hit stuff with whatever weapon they possesses or use artes (hitting but fancy or magic), with you controlling one character. Rather than being able to guard, you are only able to dodge. This introduces a far greater skill ceiling as once started, an attack cannot be interupted to dodge. It makes the combat feel faster and more dynamic, and though the change was unexpected I did very much enjoy the combat.
Every character has not just unique moves, but also a unique mechanic that sets them apart from the others. Furthermore, every character has a boost attack that you can call upon the enemy you are currently targeting once charged. This will teleport the character to that enemy, or spawn them in temporarily if they were not currently in battle. These attacks all have a specific purpose, from denying magic to breaking shields, and using them wrongly means you are fighting with a disadvantage. It adds a nice layer of depth and gives at least some purpose to characters not currently in battle.

[h2]Music[/h2]
Nothing much to say here. They did a very good job like usual.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
The game looks beautiful. Go watch the trailers if you want to convince yourself.

[h2]Postgame[/h2]
I will spoiler tag this just in case. There will not be any spoilers for events that happen in the postgame.
[spoiler]It's too short. The only actual postgame things are some walk-around quests that don't actually do anything, a single dungeon and a boss rush. The dungeon is nice and I do love cameo's, but it was too short (five floors with maps and a boss after every map + one more boss at the end) and the cameo's didn't feature nearly as much as in Zestiria or Berseria, which I think is a letdown. As for the boss rush: it was fun, but that's about all there is to say about it.
The actual problem is the lack of a good NG+. Grade does not exist, and what is carried over to NG+ is determined by some collectibles you can find on the map. However, there is no incentive to play NG+, as you cannot get actual buffs compared to a new game, you just carry over your ridiculously broken loadout from the endgame (that includes both your levels and equipment). Not doing NG+ is the main reason my playtime is not doubled, as it was with Zestiria and Berseria. On the other hand, if you don't care about NG+ there is still 80 hours of game to play, and because there is no reason for NG+ all achievements are obtainable in those 80 hours rather than needing 160.[/spoiler]


[h2]Sidequests[/h2]
Nothing shiny, nothing new, but they do what they are supposed to. Most of them involve killing enemies, getting resources (usually by killing enemies or finding food) or killing a boss.

[h2]Boost strike animations[/h2]
Haven't I already talked about combat? Yes. Do I want to mention these? Yes! Tales of Arise has a mechanic where if an enemy is low enough on health and your combo count is high enough you can insta-kill the enemy (not if they are a boss though). This mechanic is great.
Insta-killing an enemy triggers a couple second animation. There is one for every combination of two playable characters, making 15 in total. I'm kinda done with them after insta-killing as many enemies as I did. There's too few.

[h2]CP[/h2]
Your party has a CP gauge, which is used whenever a healing or buffing arte is cast. It resets upon a rest or by using consumables. Restricting the healing is good in theory, but in practise this mechanic just means you're spending that bit of extra gald for the consumables. It's more of a chore than anything else.

[h2]Fishing[/h2]
The fishing minigame is the only minigame, but they did a good job on it. There are quite a few ponds on the map and especially the boss fishes really put up a fight.

[h2]Difficulty and grinding[/h2]
I did my playthrough on hard mode, without using any buffs from DLC aside from getting a few additional artes on my characters due to having several costumes. That did not notably affect the difficulty.
There was only one boss that had me stuck due to me failing the damage check to prevent an AOE attack that my party couldn't survive even at full health. One level of grinding fixed that. The only other instance of grinding was beating the final boss of the post-game a couple times to get to level 100 from level 90. Mind that there are also normal and easy, if you prefer. Hard does force you to not get hit as much or bring some healing items, since you dying means a boss will attack your party as you are not distracting them enough. All in all, hard mode was perfectly doable.

TL;DR: Better than Zestiria but much worse than Berseria. Very casualized entry to the series that is [i]VERY[/i] cutscene-heavy. Plot is boring and predictable, characters are... alright I suppose, there were worse main parties in previous games ([spoiler] I'd love for Kisara to step on me though [/spoiler]). Music is good, world is good. Enemies are ""which flavor of Mountain Dew are you feeling fighting today?"" levels of bland and unispired. Worth full price? No. On sale? Probably yes.

Jesus H. Christ I'm kind of not surprised that only 1/3 of Steam's Tales of Arise owners have beaten the game. 

Tales of Arise's main problem is similar to one of original Half-Life. It does a solid job keeping up the pace but once you reach this game's Xen - sweet Jesus I kid you not - last 20% of the game is one big boring lore dump that is so boring, pointless, overexpained and uninteresting it starts to cause excruciating physical pain. After reaching [spoiler]Lenegis[/spoiler] I had to take 20 minute breaks after every hour [strike]played[/strike] of cutscenes watched. About two and a half to three hours of watching cutscenes with game being generous enough to let you """"""play"""""" in heavily scripted areas where nothing is happening and characters just keep talkingdsggsgajpdfgg hnawpughre;bgvurhbg(RBVGN""[nrb lmvg bap]rhgbna[eridbn.

I'm okay, sorry about that. Tales of Arise overexplains stuff [i]WAY[/i] too much. Everytime you load into the new area there's a chance that you will be presented with up to three 3-minute skits (Tales Of- series stamp, series of usually small Visual Novel-like cutscenes that are usually comedic in tone and used for character building, bonding, comedy and so on, however ToA f$#*ed this up too) to watch. For the most part you don't play, you watch bloody cutscenes. In general, it feels like in the last 20% of the game they simply either A) ran out of time, B) ran out of budget, hence - forced lore dump. Plot itself is very predictable too. Two main ""arcs"". I guessed 3 out of 4 main twists of Arc 1 right ([spoiler] not 4 out of 5 because I was already spoiled that tanned dude is a party member[/spoiler]). Nothing you haven't seen already.

Sigh... apart from that disasterous problem of Tales of Arise, it is the best techonogically-wise game of the series, no doubt. Combat is... actually fun, only thing I've never gotten tired of. In general it feels like it's a casualized combat ported from CODE;VEIN (I'm not implying it's a bad thing though). Port is well optimized, managed to beat it on iGPU without any issues whatsoever (zero trademark console port slowdowns too, solid work Bandai, keep it up). Level featured in Demo is literally the ""laggiest"" one, rest of the game ran almost flawlessly. Oh, Bandai actually bothered to make a proper KB\Mouse controls too for a change, game can be comfortably played w\o a controller.

Main cast is... decent. Nowhere near Berseria's band of mistfits but I kinda liked them regardless, Kisara is the best girl. Characters outside of the main cast on the other hand? I honestly can't remember a single name. Jesus... I actually can't. Well, apart from Zephyr dude I suppose. Really, really bland.

World is... alright, nothing special. Deserts, tundras, jungles, mountains, shores. Staples of most of JRPGs. For some reason they decided to not include world map and instead an entire game world is presented in a text form, quite questionable decision. The WORLD BUILDING on the other hand is... quite poor. You're given a tl;dr in the beginning cutscene and it's too bad if you forgot what this game is even about because main characters are busy discussing pointless stuff. Same goes for the enemies. ""Samey"" dragons, wolves, wyverns, slimes you've seen in previous games or any other JRPGs. Music is... eh. On one hand some of the tracks feel really solid, but on the other hand you don't want them on your playlist.

Visually stunning, but failry dissappointing adventure, however I must admit that I did had my share of fun thanks to the most entertaining combat of the series so far. First half of the game is solid too, I admit. At that point you still care about what would happen next. But alas it goes downhill towards the end. If you're into Naruto or Bleach or whatever - you'll like Tales of Arise and characters talking about nothing for 20 minutes before letting you play. I was THIS close to start skipping all cutscenes towards the end myself. 

6 out of 10. Once I'm done with post-game content, I'm never returning to this game. Shame, real shame.",1676404594,1676450021,False,50,5,0.58055722713470459,0,True,False,False

First of all, this game is beautiful. The art style and art direction are two of the strongest selling points of this game, a cell shaded style with a watercolor-like filter that looks great on both characters and environments. Voice acting and music have a good standard of quality too.

Story-wise, and gameplay-wise, the game goes through phases...the beginning is a little rough, specially in the combat system, that shines when you've got a full cast of four members (and gets even better when the full roster of six is assembled), is action RPG-oriented and allows the player the flexibility tho choose which character to use, as only one can be controlled and the rest are controlled by the AI, which isn,t bad, but not great either. There is a pseudo gambit system that I never needed to use, as the four generic strategies where more than enough to breeze through the game (which isn't difficult at all, even in hard mode).

Experience and Skill Points are granted after battle, and SPs can be spent in a skill tree to unlock abilities and raise stats, Nothing revolutionary, but works well enough. Since you will max out (or be very close to) at the end of the game, it's not that you need to choose carefully which skill to pick, which could have been managed better. Additional Skill trees can be unlocked through advancing in the main story, completing side missions, reaching certain milestones, etc.

While this system wotks through the majority of the game, it gets a little boring and repetitive by the end of the game. There is good enough enemy variety, but the game is long enough that the improved versions you find as you advanced will feel repetitive. Enemies will get a new color palette better stats, but not additional movesets.

Overall, I think the games shines in the midgame (10h to 40h of game time) and gets downhill after that. I didn't complete the post-game content after beating the game as I didn't feel motivated to keep going.

The story suffers in a similar way: it starts in a desolate, slavery-heavy setting with different shades of desperation in each new country you visit, but gets worse in the last quarter of the game. It had potential, but could have been rounded up better.

Having said that, the game was good enough for me to put over 60hrs into it, but the combat system and enemy types lacked depth and variety. I would easily rate it 8/10 adn recommend it as an above avergae Action JRPG.",1676448132,1676448132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise is an ""okay"" recommendation for me. Great gameplay and character design but is plagued with sleep inducing amount of skits and cutscenes.

Full Review:
The characters may appear as cliche early in the game but they eventually come to their own as the story progresses. It was also clear that the aim was to have at least one character to be relatable to different types and generations of players. The gameplay is also pretty similar to FF7 Remake and has pretty smooth anime-like transitions when power ups are activated. Overall, it was pretty fun to play.

Story-wise, it can be hard to follow specially at the 2nd half of the game. It appears that they tried to mitigate it by placing a huge amount of cutscenes and skits in which I struggled to keep awake. A lot of these cutscenes are also redundant and doesn't add value to the story. I would advise you to skip watching the optional cutscenes (accessed via R1) when you get to Lenegis onwards to keep your momentum going.",1676301176,1676301597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My reasoning on why it's not worth it :
All the pros fall flat due to the plot being incredibly guessable from the first hour and the pacing takes way longer than expected and the story could not hook me in to the game, the interesting bit only happens in the 2nd part of the game which is only a blip of the full game which is incredibly disappointing. The characters take way to long to get together and when they did get together the characters bickered so much it made me skip most of the little skits that make these games lovable. 

Pros I do see in the game:
- Amazing visuals with a charming watercolour look to the overall scenery
- Great voice acting
- Great character design

Although, the major issue you could tell the title was rushed, being forced to side quest to properly rank up in Hard-Mode, also forced to fish all the way at the beginning of the game to properly rank up so your team has XP boost after eating. Automatically at the fourth arc I'm being forced to start at the beginning to collect material to rank up properly. Also a ton of side quest shouldn't make up for story. Still a genius system and fun fighting but, after the Second lord it becomes dull. And I don't see the point of fighting with different characters it's quite dull.
Well, time to start at the very first stage to spend hours fishing so I may properly rank up and defeat bosses, I refuse to not play on hard mode... Besides exploring more mythical areas..... 











Old Review: 5 Hours In
Tales of Arise is a new JPRG based on the tales series I believed, which consistently from game-cube focused on team-based strategy to win the game. The A.I in the team system is changes with the player, configurable, and spot on to have fun Experience. The difficulty is is accurate compared to another RPG I recently played like FF15, which to me didn't make much sense. It seems the game was rushed because I'm in the middle of my second cave in a row, also going the fight the main bosses are redundant hopefully the third isn't in some sort of castle again(sigh*).

Gameplay 4.5/5-  I think the arte system is quite difficult because some you can't link due to AG limitation, later in the game you advance your character but still. I'm a big fan on how the game limits your experience points which will always make boss battles well worth the hype!

Story 4/5- The story is simple, fun, and engaging, going through my second tunnel/cave in a row after beating a boss in a castle isn't to cool. 

Graphics 5/5 - I like how they balanced Anime like graphics, manga, and a assortment of other styles to fit in.

Character Advancement 5/5- Perfect adjustment and placement for characters to advance with slight adjustments than the typical RPG, which makes the game not heavily focused on side-quest which will be little the combat and fun advancing in the game

Near the end of the game very repetitive and same monsters not worth the time",1671685412,1676142603,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Sanat tasarımını çok iyi. Çizimler her oyunda göremeyeceğimiz derecede güzel.
- Hikaye anlatımı oldukça güzel olmuş sanki bir çizgi film izler gibi akıyor. 
-Müzikler hoşuma gitti, ancak çizimleri çok güzel olan bir oyun için daha güzel müzikler beklerdim.

Oyunla ilgili Negatif izlenimlerim:

Gezindiğim evrende hareket serbestliği olmadığı gibi aksiyonda kullandığımız silahları veya becerilerimizi bu dünya içinde serbeste gezerken kullanamıyoruz bu gerçekten oyun çeşitliliği öldürüyor.
-Kombat sistemi teorik olarak çok güzel, ancak iş uygulamaya geldiğinde oyun evreni içersinde robot gibi duran canavarlara yaklaşınca otomatik olarak devreye giren dövüş sekansı oyundaki kombat özgürlüğünü ciddi anlamda dar boğaza sokuyor, oyun içinde sanki başka bir oyun oynuyormuş hissi veriyor dövüşten ziyade kendini sanki bir dövüş smilasyonunu yöneten birisi gibi hissediyorsun.
-Oyundaki Hızlı seyahat kısmıda çok kullanışlı değil.
- Oyunun dünyası yalancı bir açık dünya hissi veriyor, açık dünya olamaması benim için çok daha iyi , fakat açık dünya ile çizgesel oyun karışımı bir  melez gibi erken erişim oyunu tadında bir dünya bu şekilde sanatsal çizimleri olan bir oyuna yakışmamış.
-İlk 8 saat içiersinde karşılaştığım yan görevler aşırı ruhsuz üstelik npc diyaloglarında sinematik veya seslendirme yok bu şekilde özensiz bir işin bu oyunda nasıl olacağını düşünürsem kafayı yiyebilirim yan görevler erken erişim bir oyunda bile daha özenli olabilir.

NOT: 33 saat deneyimim sonrası takıma yeni eklenen karakterlerle birlikte çok iyi bir hikaye sunduğunu söyleyebilirim. Eksik gördüğüm kısımlar da oyuna gelen çeşitlilikle birlikte göz ardı edilebilir noktaya geliyor.

Gözlediğim tüm eksilere rağmen bu oyun kendine has bir tarz yaratmayı başarmış. Bu oyunun sanatsallığı aynı veya daha üst kalitede alınıp, üstüne daha iyi yan görevler, daha iyi bir evren tasarımı, keşif hissiyatı, aynı sıra tabanlı dövüş sistemini özgürleştirip tasarlayabilirlerse çok daha kaliteli bir oyun yaparlar.",1675460962,1676044197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Given that I explored almost every corner where I wasn't supposed to go in the main story, this may have caused the actual story time to be extended so take my time with a grain of salt please.
This was my first Tales of title, and I'm hooked now. The combat is quite enjoyable, and I personally recommend setting it to manual with short input ques for more flexibility. Aside from that, the game is wonderful. I finished it on hard difficulty on my first playthrough, and the challenge was good whilst not feeling too punishing yet still demanding some caution.

Though I should note that the skits in this game take a considerable amount of time and are rich in terms of lore and character development. Therefore, you may need to either be patient and watch them before rushing head-on into a new zone or watch them later at a campsite.

Is it worth continuing past the main story? Definitely, and I highly recommend doing so if you're interested in more lore, character development, and post-story content. However, before diving into New Game Plus, be aware that there are some requirements to carry over items, and there is a lot to discover and obtain past the main story.

Combat: Good god there is a lot here. Too much maybe as the game already took me 70 hours to beat on Moderate but combat feels fantastic... most of the time. Running from one encounter to the other and with the inclusion of the combo gauge once you reach the 3rd kingdom makes advancing and fighting so much fun and it is FLASHY. The enemy types are fairly recycled, I personally don't have a major problem with it since its a fairly common practice for JRPG's but be wary of the 4 types of just about every enemy. The faults come from its abhorrent health inflation, scream/roar disrupts, split second attacks and enrage mechanics... basically things that only apply to bosses. The fact that I am given the ability in most combat to learn BG stuns and cancels and learning to read the fight which is promptly robbed in bosses as they sit in an enraged form for most of the fight or have a .2 second stun window from a BG stun. Some bosses barely give you time for any comboing anyway so BG stuns are practically pointless in most boss fights. They're still cool af and stylistic but most of the fight feels more like a chore and running away like a bitch than fighting. I also didn't have much of a problem in terms of enemy damage. It it high? Fuck yeah it is, which is only a problem for AI as you learn most of the attacks easily with the exception those that have zero wind-up

AI gets its own thing, its so trash, play with all ranged characters with Decreased Aggro and melee with tankiest accessories. Most CP will be used healing and Reviving everyone except yourself

Story: It leaves plotholes for so long you worry its a shit story given there is no context or foreshadowing. The story is really good though, most of the party members story and struggles is told really well. The plotholes will get filled eventually, the game having essentially 2 sections with a new anime season intro for each makes the second section feel forced in a way but wraps up nicely having explained it all but you are lost as hell. You may say thats a part of story telling but you will understand playing it that something always feels off about its story progression.

Overall, this game is really good. Combat absolutely carries(Despite its issues), the storytelling is pretty solid with some good twists, the atmosphere is beautiful even in the most depressing areas and the conclusion felt so worth the grind.",1676000535,1676000535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Awful characters and story. 

In one scene the female protagonist hates the male one and in the next one she talks about how they need to hold together to beat the evil force. 
Legit a 5 year old can write better stories.

The battle system is build up the following way:

You fight in an arena vs enemies but the real enemy is the camera. You need to permanently adjust the camera because it randomly zooms in and out, doesnt follow enemies, doesnt follow your combos. It´s really bad.

Every boss is just a bullet sponge meaning they have 50-60k hp (the first 2 at least) and you deal 20 damage with a normal attack.

All fights that i considered hard so far, I tried to do all these fancy combos that resulted in me being obliterated by my enemy
After that I just decided to step up to the enemy, cast my (whatever the fuck the fire sword thingy where u hold down the button for a bit is called) and then pressed the dodge button followed by an attack to get close to the enemy and repeat until they died. 

When i was lucky my healer didnt just stand around jerking off but actually moved for once so in the case I  got hit she can cast her 5 second heal spell... oh she got interrupted again what a pitty, better pay 1000gals to pop a ressurection potion.

The combo system straight up doesnt work imo. You permanently have to look out for what your AI teammates do or otherwise they or you knock the enemy out of the combo string and bosses can not get knockbacked unless you brake them under certain conditions so they can powerstance and hit you out of your combo.

Also bosses bombard you with a visual array of effects that makes it unbelievable hard to recognize what´s going on on the screen at any given moment. ( talking bout the frog and the 2nd lord lmao wtf even is that fight)

If you look up guides or anything the first thing that pops up are multiple reddit threads where 150kg basement dweller neckbeard weebs who jerk of to the female protagonist on an hourly basis tell you how they easily beat the game first try on giga ultra chaos difficulty with their screen turned off and sucking them selfes off whilst shoving a my little pony figurine up their asses so you have to get good or otherwise the game just isnt for you.

The story of the game is your basic anime good guy bad guy thing where the male protagonist is so fugly that half his face is hidden by a mask or otherwise the enemies would insta die out of pure horror of his facial features and also he lost his memory (wow we never had this one before).
The female protagonist is so unlikeable that i dont even know what to say except that she must be mega bipolar as written in the beginning of my review.

I didn't like the fighting system either. I don't know, i really liked the previous combo-heavy games where you could juggle your enemies with skills (vesperia, xillia), here you pretty much just spam the ""best"" ones. Maybe it was me, but I did play the game on Hard, so it wasn't easy.
It's also a single-player which is a huge no-no for me as we've been playing through tales of games with 2 other friends of mine for the past 10+ years :)

Story- The story itself isn't all that special, but it's still an entertaining story to follow along. It's essentially a sad anime story where good triumphs over evil with a good amount of charming moments thrown in for good measure. Not bad.

Gameplay- The combat system in this game is really fun. It's a fun hybrid of hack and slash mixed with a cooldown mechanic for the characters special moves. There's a lot of diversity in play styles among the characters and it allows for some exploration for optimizing combos. Exploration in the game is pretty standard of most RPG titles. You have a a few material nodes or chests in a map you collect. See enemies in the wild you can fight and talk to your occasional NPC's for quests and story. Nothing crazy, but that's not to say it's a bad thing. 

Issues- My only really qualms with the game is that the combat system can be a little confusing at first. I think that this is one of those games that could really benefit from a combat practice room/ tutorial room so that it would allow players to really understand the mechanics or get a refresher if you were to put the game down for a bit. The last issue I had with the game is at the very end they dragged the ending out when they did the big plot reveal. A lot of the info was repeated and crammed in at the very end which really messed with the pacing of the story. 

Final Thoughts- It's a game that I think is worth your time if you like hack and slash combat mechanics with some light RPG elements wrapped in an anime colored coating. The campaign isn't all that long if you were to just plow through the main story (50-ish hours). Just prepare yourself for the ending because those cutscenes and dialogue segments were pretty lengthy. Side quests are absolutely 100% worth your time in this game and I think the creators did a great job of having interesting and rewarding parts (rewarding in both the sense of entertaining and you get good stuff) of the game that didn't tie into the main story. The post-game content is pretty ""grindy"" to actually do. Seeing as it's recommended that you be lvl.80+ for some quests, you're gonna be farming certain areas for a bit. 

Overall, I had a great time with this game. This game goes on sale pretty frequently around $20 or so and I think that is a bargain of a price if you are looking for something that has a okay story, solid battle mechanics, and a fun cast of characters.",1675053953,1675324116,True,1,0,0.51776653528213501,0,True,False,False

     -The games gameplay is good with mutiple play styles you can enjoy, However I tended to stick to using the main character as he seemed to be the highest dps and close to how i play these sorts of games
     -The Dungeons seem to be intresting in their own right, but i had found that quite a few of them seemed to similar with climbing here get lever and cross to the boss arena. 
     - The story is where this game shines the best in my eyes, some plot points are easy to see coming suck as certain people being villains are character that will probably be important later in the story, however there was also many times i was on the edge of my seat experiencing the unexpected.

The art direction and general aesthetics of this game are top notch from the vistas to the character designs.
It's one of the more beautiful games of late.
The game play I found entertaining, I really liked Tales of Graces CC battle system and found the AG system was a bit similar to that.
I liked how it had a separate healing resource management system too, giving it a little more depth.
Another good thing I thought was the character growth chart and how parts of it were unlocked after doing various tasks, it gave it some sense of accomplishment.
The fast travel was actually useful this time too, when I played Tales of Zesteria it was awful, in that game I quit because of backtracking.
The accessory crafting was a nice touch too, I found gathering and matching skills together and having the payoff in battles fun and rewarding.
I liked the sub quests and the endgame dungeons, I really liked the fishing sub quest mini game too.

The cons of this game:
I wanted to give this game a higher score but I just couldn't because the story and the pacing were terrible. 
I could only really recommend this game to people who like anime games.
There were clearly many scenes where the writers wanted to evoke powerful emotions but they just fell flat and came off as ridiculous at times.
I think the problem was that they just didn't invest any time developing those characters and somehow thought we could instantly have an emotional connection with those characters without any work.
The amount of dialogue in this game was also insane, I really get the feeling that the quality control people just didn't care about this game when they test played it.
It was especially evident in the second half of the game, it was just talking and talking and talking, just talking about nothing, my eyes just glazed over after awhile.
The economy wasn't balanced either, I think that would put a sour taste in beginners' mouths, I didn't mind it too much once you could farm the armoured knights a bit but I'm sure many people would hate such things.

Overall I think this was a slightly above average gaming experience, I'd say a 6.5/10 if I were to give it a rating.

+ Great visuals. It doesn't have that unfinished, vacant feeling that the previous games had.
+ Motion acting really brings it to life.
+ Diverse dialog keeps it interesting.
+ Some thought-provoking observations on life, albeit very surface-level. To me this made the game much more interesting.
+ Funny masks.
+ Didn't notice any bugs.

- The pervasive tropes are so cringy.
- Maps get confusing because they're isolated without a bird's-eye view showing how they connect.
- Bad translations here and there. E.g., sniff vs snuff.
- Inconsistent dialects in English breaks character. It's especially obvious in fishing dialog. If you're going to put the effort into motion acting you might as well hire a linguist to check your dialog.
- The battle system is a little improved over previous games, but still not very enjoyable. It's more about practice in building combos than skill in fighting. Combo, cutscene, combo, cutscene, etc. Occasionally, you have to dodge or do some special move to deal with an enemy attack, but for the most part it's very monotonous. I don't see the appeal.

I've seen the negative reviews about the skits and stuff

But if you're a super casual player like me? Those cons don't really affect you.

In fact, they help me remember things about the game after leaving it for a few days.
I like details of the skits emphasizing the characteristics of well.... uhh... the characters (duhhh)

This is a very late review, I really appreciate the world building and the story.
I was not expecting it to be good. Well for me at least.

I recommend buying it on sale, if you just wanna find something to play just to kill time or on your break. 
Its relaxing to play .

I believe you can appreciate this game better if you don't rush it.
Treat it like a manga that update chapters weekly lmao

If I have anything negative to say?
Maybe the costumes need more variety but that's just an aesthetic thing for me. 
I kinda wanna match the mood of the story as it progresses.... and so far its about how npc's are suffering from slavery and I have a SAMURAI/BEACH/SCHOOL COSTUME on my list (not that its bad or anything but I wanna blend in with the theme.... give me more rugged clothes lmao)

Story: 3/10, It is not interesting but not the worst story writing I've ever seen. (another thing is that they messed up the skits. As a former tales of fan, I think skits should be short and fun but in this game there is too much talking and they keep repeating what they say, definetly a torture) 

Gameplay: 8/10, It is fun and I hope it stays that way. I have high hopes for this. I don't like the fishing part tho. 

Grapic quality: 9/10, the game looks soo pretty. I like the watercolor like scenery, its different and I think they did a great job. Characters doesnt look out of place either.

Characters: 5/10, I can't feel close to any of them and their conversations are just... dull. So I can't relate. (yett?) Design-wise they are cool ig. (Shionne and Kisara so good, so nice, very cool)

Other than these, I am so sad they got rid of battle quotes, those were so fun. Skits have been my biggest dissapointment so far, side quests are boring too.

The combat felt wonky at first but it gets better, it never gets truly fluid as it is a tab target based combat system but nonetheless it pulls it off and works decent enough.

Do not play this game if you are allergic to cringe, there is a lot in this one. The plot is pretty bad and the characters are sooo shallow and cookie cutter personalities from every generic adventure anime you've seen and not the good ones either, the kiddie animes that's all about self righteousness cringe stuff.

The only reason I held it together and pushed through the game is because I paid for it and the combat was decent although I still don't feel fulfilled as my approach to these games is to have a omnipotent team at near 100% completion. the powercreep in this game never gets OP which is dissappointing personally, though some folks may take that as a plus.

P.S Kisara is best waifu, and I want a Hootle plushie.

Long Review:I got the game because I wanted a jrpg with a romance aspect that drives the story and its integral to the plot,most jrpgs fail this, and this game, although clunky in the execution at times delivered what I wanted. First, this is one of the most beautiful games, visually I have played;I liked the latin/chorus songs/themes, the battle system was okay ,I enjoyed the sub quest and liked the FFX style sphere system for special attack/stats boost. Loved hunting for the little owls to get the usual tales of wearable attachments or outfits.

The second thing I wanted was a good story, and again it was delivered. Yes, there are some plot holes (not too grating that I can't overlook) and the theme of what make a slave a slave, although heavy handed at every conversation, was concise and well explained. My experience was the first arc, I did not like it even thought to give up on the game since it seemed the plot was about politics, Second,Third arc was entertaining, then closer to the end a lot of back and forward, of repeated dialogue and plot holes and a bit of a rush ending. But, I was entertained through it all, and I found myself going in for more extra content and other things to explore. Its a Tales of game, I expected this in a way when it comes to the writting, but I have to say they vastly improved on story telling from previous tittles, It was an almost perfect story. I liked the entire party and how well they interacted. And going back to the romance aspect, you can see how they get closer and a fun little nod on the stages of a relationship (the youngest Rinwell/Law = childhood crush, the main protagonists Shionne and Alphen=young love planning a future together and the older ones Kisara and Dolhaim= a mature love where no words need to be said) It was such a well put little detail that falls well with the entire thing :)

Anyways, Imma finish this. Not a lot of bad that needs to be mentioned; Yes, buy this game, i'm sure you will find something in here that will keep you engaged, there is a lot of good stuff in this tittle.

I really liked the anime style graphics, and story line. However the story line did have some monotonous moments.

The fight game play was just alright. it felt like everything revolved around having one over powered skill that can be used for all fights again and again. When ever it got too difficult, spamming life bottles and kiting the enemy seemed to always work. 

Although the environments were really beautiful, the towns felt empty with little to no interaction. There were very few interactions aside from chat box dialogues and additional quests. However, seeing new environments and wondering what the next environment would look like was really fun.

I really had a lot of fun with character progression, leveling up, recruiting new characters and grinding for the best weapon stats in the game. 

There are many things that I over looked, but all in all, its not a bad game if you want a linear anime game with a good story line with a little challenge, its worth looking into it, but I would highly download the demo before purchasing it!

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
A long time ago, the people of Dahna lived peacefully in their world, minding their own business and their own culture, being able every night when looking at the sky to see another planet very close called Rehna, which they believed to be the resting place of the souls of the departed. But one day all that changed, when spaceships came from the neighboring planet and began a brutal and rapid conquest, thus making Dahna, with almost no chance of resistance, fall into the hands of Rehna's conquerors, and this happened three hundred years ago. ^^

Now three centuries after that tragic event, the world is divided into five kingdoms each focused on one element, and each controlled by a lord of Rehna who, along with his or her soldiers, does as they pleases with the local people who are seen as slaves expendable, to be able to produce as much energy from the element of they realm as possible, in search of becoming the next leader of Rehna. Such practices obviously do not please the locals of Dahna who have tried to unite in resistance groups, but this has always failed, at least until now, where in the deserts of the kingdom of fire a person appears, with white hair who say he feel no pain, and who has no idea how important it will be to change the balance of the scales. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ A very interesting story from its first act, with a wide variety of things, whether it's focusing on the main story while watching the group members change and learning, or doing smaller activities like fishing and cooking, but also showing more of the world and the characters.
+ Very charismatic cast, all the characters that make up the group have their own stories with their bitter memories of the past, but also several fun moments which some made me have a good laugh.
+ Fluid combat, easy to understand and a lot of fun, with each of the characters having a useful power against certain enemy tactics.
+ Beautiful graphics, maybe not so much in the first two kingdoms, as they use much the same colors a lot due to geography, but from the third the beauty of the world becomes much clearer.
+ Good music and sound effects, along with excellent work by the people who voiced the characters.
+ I liked the mini-games like fishing and finding all the owls, I find them very fun.
+ I started to like owls a lot more after this game.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- I felt that in terms of DLC, it left the game a little unfair, as not only do we have DLC that allow you to level up characters immediately, but many other DLCs that include items that, for example, reduce the prices of items in stores or increase them as much as possible, that we can have of healing items, making the game easier, but only for those who buy the DLC.
- The story from a certain point starts to have several twists and mindblown, I personally liked it, but I don't guarantee that it will please everyone.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
And so begins the journey of our group of heroes, in this adventure in RPG style where we have to travel and explore the five kingdoms and beyond, fighting to bring freedom and beyond back to the people, but that won't be easy, because each of the lords is very determined to win the competition, and using any means they think is valid for that, includes sending several soldiers and the most diverse monsters to try to stop our heroes. ^^

Which leads us to the most diverse battles, where as we advance in the story and release new characters, we can use them in battles in a more action RPG style, where we can control one of the characters of our choice, while the AI controls the other characters, thus allowing the characters to fight together and make devastating combos. In addition, each of the characters has a special ability that not only deals a lot of damage, but can also be very useful against certain enemies or their movements. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by the studio BANDAI NAMCO, I must say that I really liked the graphics, a friend of mine had already praised it before and I confirmed it, especially from the third kingdom, because in the two previous ones, due to particular issues of the kingdoms, there are not so many variations in colors and in architecture, but from the third we see a greater variety of colors and greater variety and creativity in constructions. As for the soundtrack, I was also very satisfied with the music and sound effects, but mainly with the excellent work that was done with the Japanese voices, mainly because there are many lines, both more serious and tense, as well as lighter and fun. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
I must confess here that Tales of Arise was not the first game in the Tales series that I started, but it was the first game that I completed the entire story, and I must say that I was very satisfied and looking forward to future releases in the series, as well as to return to other titles in the series to complete them. So Arise is a game that I highly recommend to everyone, because I had so much fun with the main story, which always made me want to see more, as with the other activities, like trying to catch all the fish, becoming like this, in my opinion a great recommendation to everyone. ^^",1663643253,1674413556,True,30,2,0.642891526222229004,0,True,False,False

It has a decent enough start, not great just decent, but past the second region the game just quickly falls completely apart.

-Boss fights are a waste and the only way you fight them is through a gimmick attack and by spamming strong moves. You can't combo them, which is just unforgivable since it's a game all about stringing together combos.
-Enemies become total damage sponges halfway through with way too much health and Every Single Fight just becomes a chore.
-EXP rates are painfully low so it pressures you into buying the DLC.

you will watch 30 minutes of cut scenes (no kidding a full half hour of bad anime, commercial-free) where you cannot interact with the game whatsoever

then you get to walk a few feet (don't turn left or right or you'll hit an invisible wall) and then back to the TV show for 10 more minutes

then you'll finally start to play, only to discover that it's yet ANOTHER jrpg that hates: interesting story lines, decent camera controls, familiar button mapping, or widescreen support

My two recommendations is you use the Japanese voice acting, its MUCH better imo. The second, you can set up how your AI act in combat which you 100% need to do. You can choose what items they use and when, you can choose what healing/support skills to use and when. Without setting this up, you will probably have a very rough time as they will burn your CP (used for healing spells) and use all your recovery items.

The combat gets better when you unlock the ability to use a second set of skills on top of your primary set, and you really shouldn't bull rush enemies down. When fighting normal mobs you want to build up combos to insta-kill them to make it faster, although boss fights have no combo system, so they will be much longer due to large health pools.

I played on hard start to finish with the base game and no DLC. I wasn't down bad for money or anything, selling your monster parts you aren't using for crafting will give you all the money to need to upgrade and restock.

If you're after a great modern JRPG you won't be disappointed with this game.

Gameplay is alot of fun, the majority of it is pretty standard to JRPGs, though this isn't a bad thing at all, it carries many of the classic tropes that we look for in these games. 

The combat is alot of fun, there's alot to learn, all 6 characters are completely playable with customizable kits, normally I find games that have other playable party members aren't as good as the main character and thus you find yourself never using the other characters, this game not so much, don't get me wrong I still played Alphen for the majority of the game, but the odd time I did play a different character it didn't feel clunky or out of place.

The combos are really fun and fairly easy to pull off, but to make your own combos is completely on you, you unlock moves and abilities and can choose 6 ground attacks and 6 air attacks, playing around with different move set ups and combos is always alot of fun, it plays very smooth, i often found if something felt a bit off I could go and change something I didn't like or simply had to learn how to fit a certain move into my kit. 

Now with all this praise about the combat does come a couple of complaints
Some of the boost attacks felt useless alot of the time, they all deal damage so they're not completely useless, but they all have specific uses, Shionne can stun enemies out of the sky, very useful, Rinwell can stop enemies from casting spells also very useful, Law can break armour... sounds useful, and it is at times though there are not enough armoured enemies for this to feel awfully useful, Dohalims boost feels almost useless, like it doesn't really do anything at all, or at least thats how it felt.

Changing your stratagy is all well and good but in the heat of battle you do often find the party members being somewhat careless with Items and positioning, these are all things you can kinda control with the strategy system but it did feel a little flawed at times, this isn't a huge complaint mind, its just something i noticed here and there. 

Big enemies and bosses, basically anything with alot of health makes the combat feel very button mashy, this is probably my biggest complaint with the combat, rather than being excited about huge enemies towards the end there's so many of them that its kinda a drag, they dont break like smaller enemies do so your combos don't have the same effect, normally comes down to doding around spamming the powerful moves and spamming boost attacks, unless there's a specific move or something an enemy has that requires a specific boost attack then using boosts against bosses feels sometimes mindless. 

there are alot of different enemy types, though there's also alot of repeated, recoloured enemies for different zones, this is pretty common for JRPGs so i wont rag on it too hard, but it does happen like... alot, in most open zones past any challenges or big enemies the majority of the open zones consist of different variants of the same 5 or  6 enemy types, towards the end I was sick of seeing some of them i must say. 

Story is actually pretty good, but i don't think the writing is awfully good, though the story did have me gripped at times the game dosen't know how to take a breather, there's ALOT of talking, especially towards the end game, soooo much dialogue and alot of it is them repeating themselves, now this does achive its desired result, by the end of the game i really felt conntected to this group of characters and they do have some good depth but at a point its like... at what cost? lenegis especially had me sitting there for literally hours just watching cutscenes, and some of it being so drawn out left my attention drifting and sometimes i'd just completely miss something important because of the excessive waffling. 

Music is great, nothing mindblowing but i certainly have found it all on spotify and dotted some of its songs throughout my playlist collection, it compliments the game very nicely, though sometimes i felt it wasn't the best implimented, like sometimes i'm just walking around a chill open area and the music just didn't know when to chill tf out, this wasn't an overly common occourance but i really noticed it when it was, I think its more noticeable in the early game. 

I've not put the game down just yet but my opinion of the endgame content so far is pretty strong, there's actually alot to do at the end of the game and i feel like leveling to max and being able to go and do the superbosses will feel natrual, I'm currently nearly level 80 and i still have alot to do, which means no spending hours just grinding for levels which is quite refreshing for a game like this actually, I think by time i've done everything BUT the hardest stuff, i'll be ready for it. 

really good experience overall, as i say if you're looking for a good JRPG to take you on a fun and engaging adventure then this is a solid pick.

On one hand the tales storytelling/characters are so very on point and among the best jrpgs you will find anywhere in that regard. They are amazing and the reason i keep going back to tales game despite my reservations below.

Then you have the combat system which has always struck me as way too ""fighting gameish"", it relies on many  long and unintuitive combos and precise timing to make the combos work.
Combine that with enemy attacks that are often poorly telegraphed and require super fast reflexes to dodge and you have a system that can feel downright impenetrable and always leaves you feeling like are just fumbling through and never doing particularly well.

This game has probably what i consider the best battle system to date for a tales game, the combo system has been streamlined so its simple but satisfying. The old system of 8 artes at once has been overhaul to just 3. 
Now you can perform combos and feel like you are doing well without also feeling like you are playing a piano. 
Air and ground attacks have been totally separated (so i guess 6 artes but normal artes become air artes when in the air) so now air combos are much easier/more intuitive than before. It all comes together to make the system feel so much more natural.
Combine this with enemies that better telegraph their attacks (much less quick jabbing which the previous games loved to spam at you) and you always feel more in control of the fights.

Seriously to anyone on the fence about a tales game because the combat system has always been too dense i highly recommend this, give it a try.
Its a big departure from previous titles and far more accessible. 

Hopefully the series will continue in this direction, it was always a massive shame for such an awesome jrpg setting to always be walled behind such a hardcore combat system.",1674009505,1674009505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think most of the negatives being said about the game are from people that are unfamiliar with some key differences between RPG and JRPG that pertain to more than simply the country of origin.

I think the biggest critic skewing towards the negative for me is just me being nitpicky. Said critic would be that there is little real variety with enemies. For the most part there is just a handful of enemy types you encounter throughout the game with the only difference to them being that they are different colors and levels in different regions with their elemental affinity changed to that of their color/region.

Besides the story just being like ""wait there's more,"" the combat gets tedious. Sure I'm on the hardest difficulty but I checked other reviews and such to truthfully say that the game is not hard versus mobs, you just have to combo a lot and it takes a too long. Each fight versus trash mobs takes a few minutes too long, that's right, minutes. Against bosses? This game fucking aches. You just spam attacks then dodge. While doing this, your AI companions will be getting absolutely WRECKED. They won't be helpful. They will be eating up your CP which is for heals. 

CP? Yeah that stuff doesn't come back after fights. You have to go through dungeons and whatnot with just that little bit you have. Of course there is items but those will get burned through by the awful AI just as quickly. God forbid you actually spend the big bucks on the revives...

Story is actually really good and nice, but I was prepared for the ending. I was reading to knock this off and continue on to another game.

The writers shoe-horned in A LOT of the world facts without being subtle about it within the first few hours of gameplay. It's basically ""this is the world and how it works"". HOWEVER, after that the world does build on itself quite well. The writers found their footing and constantly surprised me after the first realm. Just lots of twists I didn't expect and I like to think I've become jaded over the years of playing so many RPGs. I've been genuinely pleasantly surprised by the overall writing.

The in-combat cinematics are amazing. The ToA store page's gifs don't do them justice. They easily beat Tales of Zestiria hands down. Seriously, only a ToZ fanboy would try saying they're better. The overall combat feels much more fluent compared to it too. My only complaint is it can be a bit of a pain to switch targets.

If you don't like spoilers don't watch the opening theme. It will play it every time you launch the game and once after you beat the first realm. You can skip the opening them after launching the game but not the one after beating the first realm. So grab a drink or watch a video of something else while you wait.

The draw distances of NPCs, enemies and shadows are abysmal. Get the Arise SDK mod. It's super simple to install and fixes a ton of issues. Outside of the draw distance issues mentioned a moment ago. There are lots of graphical options that do not require a restart of the game.

If you rush through (not speed running) you can probably beat ToA in about 40 hours. Maybe 30-35 if you're really good. But if you take your time, watch nearly all of the cut-scenes, and grind out some of your gear towards the end like I am. You'll probably end up around 50-60 hours like I'm heading towards at the time of this review.

Playing with a m+kb. It could be better but it's still pretty good. Lots of the menu options auto-move the mouse to the appropriate menu to make it easy to click. There's only a few that I wish that they worked on.

My only main other complaint is the lack of variety of enemies. There are A LOT of reskinned enemies. They aren't even subtle about it.

[spoiler] In areas where there are lots of soldiers. FARM THEM. They drop dog tags that can be sold for gald. Gald is annoying to come by even late game.

Some artes will be advantageous against certain enemies and some elements will more against a weakness but it's all unnecessary.  You don't have to worry about immune enemies either.

First of all the graphics. The game looks great and there is so many unique places to look at. Definitely one of the highlights of the game. Characters are well detailed as well. 
The Sound and Music. Well.. the music servers it purpose but it's nothing that memorable. It felt quite generic but ..it's fine..? I guess. After Tales of Zestiria every other Tales game feels like they can't possibly top that. 
Gameplay was awesome and fun. The combat was smooth and it was great to combo artes up. Only thing was that the spells were kinda useless and slow to use. Just because you could do so many quick artes with casters instead of using big spells. They could have been more useful. Do more damage or something. I played on Hard difficulty whole game and sure, it felt sometime a chore because the enemies just tanked juust too many hits sometime and it affected the games pace quite a lot. 
The game felt a bit linear at times so there could have been more open areas with stuff to discover. There were sidequests that you could do for getting your characters skills. Getting SP points was more useful than experience in the end. There was also fishing, crafting and such, but they were kinda bare bones. 
About the plot and the characters. 
The plot was kinda generic, I think. There was some unique stuff that prevented this game falling into the gray mass of jRPGs, but nothing spectacular. I have to compare this to Tales of Berseria a bit because I hated the characters in that game so much it ruined the rest of the game for me. In this game there was Shionne, whose character arc saved this game for me in the end. Other characters were kinda boring and could have used a bit more fleshed out character arcs. Even the main characters big reveal didn't save him being just a generic good guy.
In the end I liked this game even with the generic plot and characters. It was a good ride and I recommend getting this on SALE ONLY. I don't think this game is worth full price at the moment.

Watching the characters interact with each other and their environment was a delight. They have a lot to say about everything, and skits follow tangents that are empathetic, enlightening, and entertaining. If only people in real life were that interesting, I might be inclined to be more social.

Visually, the game is astonishingly pretty.

Tales of Arise is definitely a deviation from the classic 3D Tales games with a lot of new and changed elements. Of course, ToA was initially conceived as a new IP, and so it makes sense that this game isn't entirely in the same vein as what most Tales fans are used to. That being said, ToA does not feel like it ""doesn't belong"" - it looks like a Tales game, feels like a Tales game, plays like a Tales game. The changes made are not steps taken backward or decisions led astray, but rather innovative ways to bring new life into a classic franchise in a way that helps the franchise evolve. 

I do have some complaints with regards to pacing and balancing between dialogue and action in the last leg of the game, but it didn't take away too much from the game. The jam-packed dialogue scenes were made bearable by an amazing Japanese cast; I don't know how the English voice-over compares, but with my past experiences with Tales' NA localisations, I'm confident it should not fail to live up to expectations.

Combat - i think this game has the best Tales combat out there. Its easy to learn, hard to master, finishing moves are flashy as hell and they don't take long to make you wish to skip them. AI is not stupid and does decent job at playing your other characters. As usual though, battles can be felt dragged and normal attacks\skills lack impact, but that's been a problem for all Tales titles. Certain boss encounters may feel hard even on Normal difficulty and require some strategizing

Characters - both gameplay and story wise, cast feels good. They are not constantly whining and recover from any story induced shock fairly quickly, understanding that they have to move forward to achieve their goal no matter what.

Story - half good, half meh if you ask me. First half of the game i enjoyed very much, even though goal was as standard as you can think of (collect 5 artifacts by defeating 5 evil retards. well, 4 in fact, since one of them you recieve for free). After that though, it felt as a drag, going above and beyond original philosophy (make 2 human races coexist peacefully), taking step into celestial\cosmic crap and forgetting everything else, since ""now we have bigger shit to worry about"". 

Cutscenes\skits - there are a lot of them and unfortunately, cutscene\skit placement is poor. imagine getting story cutscene, then after that 2 (sometimes even 3) long skits, then making 3 steps forward and getting 1 more story cutscene and 1-2 skits more afterwards. i mean, thanks for the effort, but later on i began skipping  because it was way too much me.

Overall, it is a decent game with very good anime visuals, ok'ish overall story, decent character cast (except maybe for that Sephirot look-alike villain), engaging combat and flashy moves.

P.S. - oh, and please ignore those power up DLCs with money\exp boosts. If there's one thing Bandai Namco needs to learn, is that selling ingame currency and levels should stop. Use cheat engine if you want to add a few levels\some money instead, there's no protection in the game against it",1673467860,1673468067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a JRPG and being judged as such, you might actually like it. I was not aware that JRPGS where 90% story/dialogue, then a little running and some combat.  I just can't get into it because the balance is just off and the gameplay inbetween just isn't good enough to keep me motivated. 

I liked the over-the-top anime style cinematics in combat, but they get old real quick and they aren't impactful - and also, i hate how you get boxed in for combat and the bosses are so spungey, even on normal. They aren't THAT hard, but they take forever and it's tedious toggling between characters and in/out of the item menu to heal/res party members over and over. 

So basically, if you LOVE JRPGs, well you might like this a whole lot more than me. If you are less of a ""watch dialogue for 35 out of 40ish hours"" like me, then this game will bore you the fuck out. Nice characters, neat enough premiss and alright bosses; but too much dialogue and unedibly simple gameplay.

Completed the base game.  Typical anime style of characters.  Most look like kids saving the world but still dealing with basic emotional situation.... but that's most anime.  Story was fairly good and enjoyable with some twists you don't see coming.  The game did seem long as I thought I was about over but looking back I still had another 20hrs.  One major complaint was the travel is very linear, there is no open world map.  You cant fast travel wherever you want, or to hubs, but never having an open world was a let down.  Similar battle style of all Tales games that you love or hate.  I was not excited about it and wanted to give another Tales game a shot.  I came to enjoy it as you can set the battle to be almost auto and it seemed better than say Tales of Vesperia in that area.  I think if you like Tales games you will like this one but if you are on the fence and haven't liked previous Tales games I would look elsewhere.

The positives -

- Really enjoyed the gameplay of this one, it was flashy and characters kept unlocking new artes till very late into the game, making your combat set ups feel fresh. 

- Graphics are gorgeous.

- Music is great.

The Ok's -

Characters - The characters are a tough one for me. I didn't hate any of the main cast, but there was only really one I grew attached to when it came to their story arch. In comparison to the previous entry, Berseria, character writing was definitely weaker. 

Story - The story had a lot of potential to be amazing, however due to what felt like end game crunch time, it does sadly fall off. I won't go into a lot of detail here about the pacing as I'll save that for negatives. 

Exploraton - I enjoyed seeing the different areas the team came up with for us to run around in, some of them are really gorgeous. However outside of fighting enemies, collecting treasures and a few other generic jrpg features, this game did absolutely nothing to enhance exploring the environments they created, It's a shame really, as I say some of them were really stunning. Ultimately they are just open/linear areas for us to run through to get to the next story section. There's nothing remotely interesting to make you want to stic around in them. Still, atleast it as better than the god awful backtracking and areas in Berseria. 

Balancing - Game is either really easy or infuriatingly hard. There is no inbetween.

Negatives - 

Pacing - Right from the get go you can feel the story being rushed. You're expected to care for these new characters immediately with absolutely no building of character because of how fast the story is progressing. In the blink of an eye you're already fighting your first main boss after running through the first main dungeon, it was EXTREMELY underwhelming. There are a couple of parts that felt way more fleshed out, and by result the characters introduced in those parts were easier to connect with.   

Ending - My god, the last couple of dungeons you need to run through to finally reach this games conclusion (another thing that felt rushed) were incredibly dull. It's just running through corridors, fighting the same mobs over and over and then being stopped to watch a cutscene and a skit explaining the exact same things.  They'd have been much better off completely cutting out the second half of this game and focusing all their time and attention on making the first half far more fleshed out and the key story. This could have left them with way more time and resource to focus on actually bringing something new to the series, but sadly....they did not. 

Overall I give the game a 6.5. It feels bad to say because I did have fun with it, but so much of this game is just mediocre.",1673124175,1673124175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game lacks exploration, lacks customization and variation in how you build your character, lacks ability to control your squad mates in the most elementary ways and consequently needlessly starves you of basic resources with which to play (details below). In addition, this game has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard in any game. It is unlistenable. Badly written, poorly orchestrated loops that fail to match the mood of the dialogue or story.

The combat system is disorganized. You cannot control who your party is targeting, nor when or how they execute the majority of their moves, except for specials. You can customize which abilities you use, but beyond that everything is set. For example, there is an ability point which allows you to regain stamina each time you land a critical hit. But there is no ability that buffs crit rate. There's no weapon or equipment that buffs crit rate. Combat is not unique, not situational. It is all the identical combat. There is no use of the environment in combat. There is no line of sight, nor cover. There is no mez or crowd control. You have limited access to AOE. No ability directly sets up or combos with another, except by generically creating chain hit strings. The only decision point in combat is ascertaining the elemental type of your enemy, as they are weak to its opposite. 

Your party AI is stupid. They constantly stand in enemy attacks and lose HP. HP is recovered by healing artes. But it costs CP to use healing artes. CP cannot be recovered except by sleeping which resets enemies, or items which cost gold and should be spared for emergency use during boss fights. Thus in many parts of the game you are starved of the ability to heal, not because your own playing is unskillful but because the AI cannot stand out of stupid. But not only this: your main characters' most powerful attacks cost life to execute. So, essentially, it costs gold to use your most powerful normal attacks which is absolutely idiotic, infuriating design. You have this arsenal of incredible attacks which you are discouraged from using the majority of the time because it costs a non-renewable resource to use. 

The one positive aspect of this game is the story which is an allegory against colonialism and enslavement. The fact that you are formerly enslaved rebels out to end enslavement and exploitative resource extraction is what kept me going. But it is not good enough to compensate for (1) overly simplistic combat with major design flaws (2) a flat, non-immersive world on rails (3) an outrageously bad soundtrack",1672948228,1672948228,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really liked that it looks like you good at the game, with all effect and teamwork strikes. System of titles is interesting. Good amount of moves and magic. And there good amount of bosses and regular enemy's. 
Characters and story? Pure anime. Idealistic and black/white mentality (They try to add notes of gray ... but well, it went poorly imo. Nothing can redeem literal genocide). Main antagonist (human one) is edgy to the extreme. And final is ...  nakama (friendship) wins.

The good:
* Combat flows nicely and is incredibly anime (if that's your thing you'll love this). The boost strike system is a nice tactical addition and the boost finishers are varied enough to not get boring. 
* English Voice acting is good, at times excellent. Cringy voice lines are few and far between. 
* Animation of characters is good, better than I remember Berseria being. 
* Fishing minigame is nice. 
* map and quicktravel system makes it easy not to miss anything (but this can be a downside too as it makes exploration trivial). 

The bad:
* feels even more linear than tales of usually does. 
* Story is pretty bland, it feels like a poor rehash of Symphonia's story. 
* character development is predictable, with the main romance dynamic being an incredibly boring tsundere story. 
* Sidequests are boring as well, with no depth to them except fetch this thing or slay that monster. 
* The rpg grind is limited, as far as I can tell. There is very little in the way of character customization and even the 'build your own accessory' system is shallow to the point where you can create best in slot accessories with relatively little effort.
* there are a few animated cartoon cutscenes, as is common for Tales Of. In contrast to previous titles, I feel these actually detract from the experience. The in-game animation simply looks better than the anime-style, and since in-game cutscenes preserve the weapon and armor skins you have equiped, but the anime doesn't, there's this weird discontinuity. 

EDIT: I have now finished the game. I have additional cons. The story gets even weaker near the end, with some severe deus-ex-machina nonsense. The postgame/newgame+ is also not worthwhile, there is no replay value to speak of.

It makes the series lean more towards the action-rpgs coming out, with its own dodge mechanic where if you perform a perfect dodge at the last second, you slow down time and can rack up extra damage. It is an annoyance however, that you cannot dodge while your character is performing a skill animation, so you can try to dodge with more then enough time to spare but have to watch your character get hit anyway. 

Enemy variety is atrocious, the enemies you encounter at the start of the game can be seen in different colors in the end game as well. 

The game seems to speed up the story to the point that the end game feels smaller and more rushed then when you started. It takes way too long in parts where everything is predictable, especially character introduction that are as generic as they can get.

Perhaps the worst portion for me is that it was way too linear. Maps are almost straight corridors with a few branching paths, but nothing you can get lost in. The sense of exploration is lost when you realize that the path you took to cross the world isn't nearly as long nor branching as it could have been.

TL;DR
Great visuals and flashy animations but still won't recommend this game for players like me who don't like to waste a lot of time grinding (unintentionally) just to make the story progression easier. The story is good until the first half but the next part starts to meh.

-----

Played this game in a ""normal"" difficulty, I would say it's a good game but not for everyone. It has a lot of good animations, some good plots, a lot of flashy moves, and character strike combinations.

What I don't like about it is that the story starts to fall off after the first half of the game, the pacing seems off, the storytelling is kind of a rush, and the ending was a meh. But don't get me wrong for hating it, it's just that there was a lot of lost opportunity for them to make it better (*sad Hootle noise).

The battle game play is unique for this game and I was able to adjust with the battle mechanics, overall the character movements and attacks are good, mystic artes and strike mechanics are great and has flashy animations (the selling point).

But what turns me off are the following:
> Perfect dodge/guard mechanic, it feels unpolished because you can't interrupt your attack animation (and I don't feel like the game encourages you to do so) so you really have to think twice if you are going to attack or dodge/guard especially if you want to conserve your CP just to avoid using healing spells (see point 2 why this is so). I would say this seems really put you off because the battle looks like fast-paced and you expect to be so but when you execute commands/movements you can't quite do so because of the limitations.

> CP (Cure Points) usage, this is your team's ""mana"" where you can use your healing or resurrect spells and for world exploration (WTF!), your offensive spells doesn't consume CP (nice). It's shared as a team (not individual) and can be only increased by leveling up as a party (pretty straightforward) OR by exploring the world and defeat mini-bosses (the grind part).

You might say ""it shouldn't be bad right?"" or ""you can always buy potions. DUH"", let me explain further, mini bosses are tend to be difficulty spiked monsters so it's not a monster that you can just casually walk into and defeat them, so you have to grind for a bit to get better equipment and/or skills to defeat them easily (yes you can still brute force your way and try to find exploits but good luck having hard time defeating them) and the grinding in this game isn't rewarding for me so pass on that.
Next, you can also use CP for removing obstacles in most maps just to get that 1 chest (not 2 or 3, just 1) that contains a decent equip upgrade or CP-restoring item. It costs you 40 CP which is more than (x4) what it cost you for using your healing/resurrect abilities (WTF TO THAT) they call it ""Cure Points"" but can also be ""Cut the obstacle Points"", maybe they were so high when they decided to include this in the game. Oh, did I tell you that most dungeons has a lot of monster encounters? so ideally you'll also need to conserve CP for your healing/resurrect on battles, good luck with your OCD!
Lastly, about CP-restoring items, unfortunately even in ""normal"" mode the game isn't generous to reward you a lot of it in battles OR even treasure chests! (rare drop) so you'll just have to buy them from NPCs which are WAY OVERPRICED the cheapest you can buy is @ 3000 Ghald (WTF TO THAT) imagine only getting enough ghalds each battle + you also need to buy upgrades on your equipment so most of the time you'll find your money short to buy them (unless you will sacrifice upgrading your equipment). TBH I won't waste my time putting this harsh review about their CP mechanics if it didn't give me a headache through out my play through.

> Most side quests are kind of boring, it's mostly for the sake of grind although some of them is connected with the story, but overall I didn't feel hooked into fulfilling them.

> Battle strategy config is hard to understand, so I didn't bother wasting time exploring on it and doing experimentation with what fits best for my playstyle

> Skill/Abilities does not have a preview in the menu so it's really hard to decide what to put in your macro config, on my initial play through I've been experimenting which skills fits best for my preference but as I progresses the story and learned more skills/abilities I gave up checking them individually (experimenting) and I just stick with my skill macros til I finish the game.

> Too much unnecessary cut scenes (on some scenarios) when they can just merge them to one cut scene, imagine after finishing a very long cut scene and then you start to move forward (5~10 steps) it triggers another cut scene. WTF

> This is only nitpicking on my part, but there are cut scenes that I would have preferred to be just in-game rendered rather than an anime video of it (seems like they just have a low budget for anime scenes hence the low quality)

To conclude, I don't hate the game but apparently it left me with a bad taste when I finished the story that's why I don't recommend it, the game graphics and  flashu animations seems to be the selling point of this game but other than that the rest of the features doesn't really appeal me much. To be honest I don't really mind the grind in this game just for achievements but the fact you have to grind to make your story progression easier what turns me off.",1672634938,1672654585,False,5,0,0.493966609239578247,0,True,False,False

Option 1. You play on Normal or harder, turn off any EXP / SP boosts you have from DLC and stay around the same level as the next boss.

Option 2. You use EXP increases, lower the difficulty when needed and usually stay 3-5 levels higher than the next boss.

I say this because both of the playstyles give you a vastly different experience. Around 2/3 into this game (when you reach Ganath Haros) you arrive at a crossroads. most enemies have CC at this point (paralysis, stun etc.) and your party members die in 4-5 hits because the AI doesn't dodge like the player does. 

If you choose Option 1, you are pushed into playing this game like a pseudo-souls-like. Having to carefully attack and dodge so you don't waste all of your healing items. It gets tedious witnessing every party member die at least 4-5 times per boss. It even made me pick into my Elixirs to resurrect people because I so often ran out of Life Bottles. This especially turns Shionne into a healbot because she doesn't have time to deal damage when everyone is dying so quickly.

Option 2, however, keeps the scrappy, chaotic combat from the first half of the game intact. The game will never challenge you, but you don't have to deal with party members throwing your fights.

I eventually chose Option 2. If you choose Option 1, prepare to span Reigning Slash 3000+ times (that's literally how much I used it, you can check in the Artes menu). Also, prepare to only use Alphen, Shionne, Rinwell and Kisara for the whole game. Law dies especially fast and Dohalim is just the worse version of Rinwell, Law and Shionne at the same time (basically a weak jack-of-all-trades character).

I wish there was an option to skip combat cutscenes. I used Kisara in my party as soon as I got her. I think I saw her Mystic Arte (her super move) over 200 times over the course of the game. This is a ~10 second unskippable cutscene of her slamming a massive shield at the enemy, then landing on it and shooting fire and ice everywhere. It's a cool cinematic. I didn't need to see it 200 times though. I either disable the move entirely, and willing nerf her by denying her the strongest move she has, or watch that cutscene at least once every two fights. This is only a Kisara problem though (she takes a lot of damage which gives her a bunch of charge for this move).

Enough whining about that. The visuals are fucking stunning. Combat and the world are both astonishing to look at. I know there are a lot of people on the 'realism' train. But if you feel like you can appreciate stylised graphics, this game is up there with the greats. The music is pretty neat too. It's no Kingdom Hearts or Persona, but it really holds up. This isn't a Dragon Quest 11 situation where it gets too repetitive either.

It runs well too. I have a mid-tier system (GTX 1650 and an i7-3770) and it ran consistently at 60 fps in combat and 80+ out of combat.

The story is a big box of clichés. Nothing special but I'd be wrong if I said it's bad. I truly wish it lead to more. Of course, near the end there are some genuinely interesting twists if you didn't piece things together earlier on. But this is ~2 hours before you beat the game, and nothing really comes of it. There's nothing more I can really say without spoiling anything, but the story is good enough motivation to keep you going.

Exploration didn't really lead to much. You get some armour sometimes, but usually it's some ingredients or a useless tier 1 accessory (you can easily make better ones). The main reason to explore is for the hidden owls that give you cosmetics. I actually enjoyed running around looking for them, as I enjoy the cosmetics very much, but I know a lot of people won't really care about them. The best cosmetics (new outfits and weapon skins) can only be gained through DLC, story progression, the training grounds or side-quests anyway.

End-game has some cool bosses and some other Tales characters show up (Eizen my beloved) in the new dungeon. I'm not completely 100% done with it yet though, so maybe there's more.

It's an AMAZING game but let me get through the things I didn't like really quickly:
1) Last level was WAY TOO grindy, but if you're used to jrpgs, you'll be fine
2) The hand-drawn/animated scenes are subpar and mediocre compared to do captivating and gorgeous cgi 3D art design and animations 
3) I wish a few of the parts could've been skippable

With that said, it's still an amazing game that any anime/rpg fans would enjoy. I loved its characters, morals, and story direction. It also cant be mentioned enough how gorgeous everything looks inside the game. I'll play any future Tales games if it'll be just as gorgeous as Tales of Arise is because walking around the maps alone was worth purchasing the game for me.

I have played: Symphonia, abyss, berseria and vesperia.

I love the skits, i love the outfits, i love the title systems i love the combat.

This game made changes to all of that.

Skits- This game will have 4-5 in a row after a boss fight. The story to this game made me apathetic to it by telling it terribly. I actively got to the point where i would just skip scenes because i was sick of watching them.

Outfits- Still pretty legit. Finding owls for cosmetic gear was fun. Being able to put ""deal with it"" glasses on kisara adds 2 points to the game itself.

Title Systems- they changed it up to where now if you unlock a title you can buy new skills from that title.
I don't like this change, i don't like my skills being tied to arbitrary crap
i liked the old style of use X skill X times etc. (that still happens in this game but to a lesser degree)

Combat -
Oh combat... what can i say about this other than i feel the most changes here from the other tales games and personally this was a huge miss for me and made me hate this game after hour 15

so everyone gets these ""counter/assist skills"" that all work on one specific kind of enemy and just do damage otherwise.. but they are really niche

for example, Law will punch things stupid hard and break thier armor
great if you have one heavy armored guy

but if you have 2-3 you have to wait until law's move charges up to use it again.. and while the big guys have their armor non broken your other teammates do like 5% of their damage..
it artificially extends combat and it feels terrible.
Bosses are awful, although not as bad as trash due to always having the skill you need up as you control when to use it- but they are awful because when they get to about 5% they will start spamming super moves and you have to use an assist move to kill the boss.
NP if it is up
if not i guess you get to run around and try not to die.

Not to mention that they have way to much life to the point where the boss will start looping animations and make the fight very boring.

If you are a tales fan this game is maybe a 5
if you are not- avoid this

i paid 20 bucks on black friday and i'm annoyed i even spent that much

Also all the most entertaining attacks the players can use and a non insignificant amount of Player power is also locked behind Costume DLCs.

Overall, the story is quite good, the game focuses entirely on the story. The world and setting are gorgeous. Battle mechanics are fun, at least for me. The combat is dynamic and fans of the franchise will have no trouble with it. The soundtrack is great.

The problems I see with the game are as follows:
1. Personally I really lack side quests. There are 3-4 per area and most of them you accidentally complete even before you accept them by simply fighting your way through the map. For such gorgeous world I really want more content to explore it.

2. At the end of the story we find out a lot of things about our characters which will remain unresolved by the end (around 25-26h mark). The ending clearly says that ""it is just the beginning"" and gives strong vibes of a sequel that would basically focus on finishing the story and wrapping it up to a satisfactory conclusion. We achieve only the basic goal set at the start of the game. and none of the goals of our main protagonists or get a glimpse to understand their stories better. Ultimately, you will be left with unanswered questions and no clarity as to what is going on. This would have been alright if the sequel was actually coming, but according to the producer of the game the company does not plan to make any direct sequels and they believe that the story is wrapped up nicely. Hence, it will remain as a standalone game. So you have to accept the fact that your questions regarding the plot, characters and all will forever remain unanswered. This is the biggest minus of the game

3. The boss fights become a drag by the end of the game. They tend to be beefed up with abnormal HP and you are forced to undergo quite a repetitive combat which becomes dull, at least for me. They do have change of phases which spices up the otherwise extremely tedious battle.

If you do not mind feeling puzzled by the end of the game and never obtaining the answers that the plot forces you to have, then I do recommend the game, but only on sale, it is not worth the full price.

This was by far the greatest, ""Sure, I guess I'll give it a shot. I just hope it doesn't disappoint"", game I have ever purchased. This game would easily outclass the FF7 remake if I didn't hold FF7's story so near and dear to my heart. I almost gave up at the beginning when I first started playing this game because I found myself comparing it to the FF7 Remake's epic and nostalgic start. That all ended after a couple hours and after about 9 hours the story came flooding out and had me stuck in the riptide. 

PROS

Fantastically riveting story.
Lovable and memorable characters.
Great cut scenes that never cease to keep my eyes locked.
An overflowing amount of Weapons, Armor, Accessories and Items.
An endless amount of unique skills for each hero.
Combo techs which combine two of your Heroes abilities and unleash a devastating blow to the enemy. (If you liked Chrono Trigger this game will not fail you.)
Each Hero has their own Overdrive ability and just as everything else, has an amazing, jaw dropping animation.
A profound skill tree that never seems to end even after 30 hours of gameplay.
A ""Perfect Dodge"" system which make the game so much more fun when you begin implementing it into your routine.
A reason for backtracking. Not that you have to do it, but for those who love to explore, this game will keep you busy.
Bring a fishing rod with you because they added fishing which is actually surprisingly very fun.


CONS

This game is a 9/10 for me but only because of my own damn stupidity. Stupidity aside this game is a solid 10/10.

In almost all aspects that you can think of in rating games, Tales of Arise does ""good"" in each criterion, but never hits the ""great"" or ""outstanding"" marks. The exception would be the production quality in its cinematics, animations, and world design, which are all gorgeous, but that is what all Tales of Arise seems to boil down to: [u]An alright, decent game wrapped with very pretty surface-level aesthetics.[/u] Several major points of interest are as follows:

- Character cast chemistry was touted to be one of Tales of Arise's biggest strengths, but I ultimately find it lacking and shallow, as most of these showcases of ""cast chemistry"" are only contained within the in-game skits, and are not reflected as much in the main story. 
- There isn't much palpable character growth for the cast except for maybe the one key event shortly after their introduction, with Kisara and Law being the biggest offenders. Only Dohalim and Rinwell had semblances of progressive growth in which you can see distinct phases of their character evolve throughout the story. 
- I also disliked how the relationships between the three pairs are being handled and resolved towards the end, creating many awkward moods for the party that are also needlessly prolonged when the relationships try to transition from being platonic to romantic. Even then, the romance pay-off isn't as satisfying as I would have hoped it to be.

- If you run a party full of magic-using members, the late-game spells will absolutely fuck your entire screen up, and you will find it hard to distinguish which spells are friendly or hostile.
- Enemy types that are huge HP sponges need to be tuned; please apply the Hellmask Fiend Skull artifact effect by default for these enemies.
- Combat in Tales of Arise for the most part will end with boost strikes, and as impressive they are in how impactful and awesome they feel, it starts to get tedious a couple of dozen hours in. I wish they implement other ways to finish off battles.
- I liked the low max item amount cap, discouraging the typical hoarding behaviour cultivated by many JRPGs.",1672284002,1672284435,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It's hard to explain precisely what makes the game so uniquely aggravating, compared to many other RPGs that might seem ""objectively"" worse on paper, but I think it really comes down to a single point: it's arrogant and pretentious.

Tales of Arise thinks it's better than it is. This theme runs through every environment, every battle, every cutscene; the game is enamored with itself, loves to hear itself talk (both figuratively and literally), and we gamers are a mere afterthought, barely worthy to behold such great art. ""Oh, you say you want [i]fun?[/i] Silly bougie, shut up and watch another six cutscenes and then fight another three giant damage-sponge quasi-bosses.""

Several examples to back up this claim:

1. Combat desperately wants to be Souls-like, but just isn't. Dodge/counter is wildly inconsistent and often ineffective; many enemies don't have visible tells, or have random timing; counters often don't cause stagger or even interrupt an enemy combo; and once you have a full party, it's impossible to consistently see what's going on anyway because you're constantly bombarded with a shower of flashing effects and a cacophony of voices shouting out their moves. The deal-breakers with Arise's combat are legion, and I won't try to list every single one. What it boils down to is that battles are very cinematic, designed to look and sound awesome to a passive viewer, but aren't actually interesting or fun to participate in.

2. The orchestral score is always big and epic, full of dramatic progressions and sweeping crescendos... even when you're just skulking around some rinky-dink passageway or fighting another trash mob. Like the combat system, it's as though it was written and arranged solely for the purpose of sounding very impressive to a passive listener, not to complement the story or environment or create any kind of immersive experience for players.

3. Bamco hired some great English voice actors who, for the most part, gave an impeccable performance... of the most stultifying, tedious, and downright depressing dialogue I've ever seen in a JRPG. The characters are almost all one-note, and the canon pairings have no chemistry. Alphen evolves from merely naive into an obnoxiously creepy male feminist. Shionne starts out with a normal (albeit prickly) personality but quickly becomes Discount Tsundere leading into Best Waifu Girl. Law is supposed to be a supremely self-confident adolescent who has no filter whatsoever, yet magically turns into a gibbering idiot around the shrill and boring pixie-bob Rinwell, whom he repeatedly refers to as a ""tomboy"" yet is actually presented as just a whiny angsty teenage girl with all the personality and depth of a wet noodle. Kisara is the mother hen - okay, we get it already! - and Dohalim is an absent-minded artiste who puts his shirt on backward. With the sheer volume of voice-acted dialogue, you'd expect to learn some interesting back-stories or see intriguing character development beyond these one-dimensional tropes, but there is none of that. In fact, none of the characters, including villains, are really important at all to the game's narrative; they're not shown to have any agency and are treated essentially as props and plot devices. What we're left with is more lipstick on a pig - voice work that's technically proficient but empty of substance.

4. The dumpster fire of a plot takes itself fanatically seriously, and throughout the entire progression is thick on heavy-handed moralizing that goes well beyond the usual ""power of friendship"" memes found in most JRPGs. I don't generally expect video games to deal with topics as complex as slavery vs. self-determination, vengeance vs. justice, friendship vs. fealty, violent revolution vs. peaceful reform, and so on... but if you ARE going to dive into those issues then you have to understand them if you don't want to break the audience's willing suspension of disbelief. Arise's morality is infantile, and comes across as having been written by some freshman student who just finished Social Studies 101, rather than anyone who's studied actual history or has enough real-life experience to understand the human condition. It's all ""slavery bad, hierarchy bad, racism bad, everything before current year bad, tear down all walls"", etc. Any possible nuance is handwaved away, often quite derisively - there's a moment when [spoiler]one party member wonders if it's human nature to organize into hierarchies, and Alphen responds with ""that just means we need to fight even harder!""[/spoiler] It's utter garbage, but constantly presents itself as being deep and thought-provoking. And that's just the half [b]before[/b] [spoiler]Lenegis[/spoiler]; the second half is just one ass-pull after another, each delivered with even more expositional dialogue and even heavier moralizing.

5. All of the environments - at least in the first half - are incredibly detailed and lifelike, from the realistic fire spewing everywhere in the first chapter to the patchy, mucky swamp land in the fifth. Yet they are all, without exception, extremely small and mostly linear. There are hardly any secrets or reasons to explore, just the same 3-4 monsters and the occasional obvious side passage with a chest or mining point in a very obvious location. There are no puzzles to solve, and very little reason to backtrack aside from the pointless forced backtracking in some of the late dungeons. Side quests are literally just ""fight this big palette-swap monster that appeared in this area you've already been to"" - none of them convey any additional narrative or flavor or take you to new or previously-unreachable areas. It's all designed to give the visual impression of a living, breathing world, despite actually having the most basic and watered-down level designs of any Tales game to date, including the original SNES title.

There's more, but I believe the point has been made. Arise is a fraud, constantly pretending to be something it's not, and wearing the Tales brand like a skinsuit while dropping steamers on any actual traces of Tales history and lore (Undine is changed from a beautiful serene woman to... well, look it up on YouTube if you're curious). Almost every single long-time Tales mechanic has been scrapped and replaced with something worse: CP replacing TP, CP-consuming map actions replacing the Sorcerer's Ring, camping replacing on-demand cooking, boosts replacing stagger/hit-stun, etc. It doesn't deserve to be called a Tales game, and it doesn't even really deserve to be called an RPG as there's no character customization or progression. It's more like a Visual Novel with a super basic crafting and battle system haphazardly tacked on.

I bought the game at 50% off and I still say: save your money. Even if you ignore the predatory DLC, there are indie games selling at a fraction of the vanilla price that are way more fun.


P.S. I doubt that any Bamco employees or execs will see this review, but on the off-chance that one does: good executives know that there is a roughly 5-year time lag between the decisions of an entrenched brand and the market response. Tales of Arise sold well because the [i]last[/i] Tales game (Berseria) was received positively by the fans. If you stop making games for the fans, and target casual/newbie audiences instead, you can get a big sales boost... [b]once[/b], maybe twice if you're lucky. After that, you'll realize that it was your Force Awakens/Avengers Endgame moment in which you ate your seed corn. You'll find that you're no longer able to recapture the original spirit of the franchise, the old fans won't come back, and the new money is fickle and quick to drop you for a newer fad.

As a long time tales series fan, if you too are a tales series fan, then I won't try to deter you. Go ahead, its more of the same and it will kill some time for ya and be some enjoyment.

As a person who expects quality from a game that still prices itself as a 60 dollar AAA title over a year after release, I file it at 1 outta 10, under incomplete.

Theres no button, and no ability to map a button to switch target. How the hell? why is this not a thing? It says they're either alt or cntrl in the menu, but neither of these work, even when remapped. When it first booted up, I had to find a way to move it off my other screen. No game has ever done that. The storyline is on permanent autoplay, so if you have someone come to the door, a kid need something while you're listening to a story, better be ready to load the game and do it over again if you wanna know that part. The feel of dodge in combat feels completely useless unless you enjoy sitting and waiting to bait things. This is my personal preference but ya it 100% weighs in for me. I don't like it when I hit dodge, and nothing happens. Screw your animation lock, the attacks last 10 seconds and the wind ups last half a second. I'm suppose to commit to the 25 hit combot without hitting dodge or getting hit at all? Bad mechanics overall. That I can forgive, but the sloppy interface problems that literally take 5 minutes to identify and fix are unforgivable and not uncommon. There's more, but honestly thats enough. This could go on to be one of my favorite stories, the voice acting isn't bad really, and the graphics are nice. But I can't recommend something to someone who hasn't played this kinda thing before, when the people creating it didn't do their job.

But ya, if you're already a tales fan, you'll grit teeth and go through it. Get it on sale. Worth about 10. Its never been worth 60, not at release, not with full dlc, and its because they don't know what they're doing with basics. Fix it all and ya, 60 on release I can see. But you can't turn back time.

Each character in the party has interesting and unique Boost Attacks that are strong in different situations (they can just be used for damage except for one but will do knock enemies down when used in these specific situations) and the mystic artes are just as easy to execute as some of the newer Tales of titles, which is something I do appreciate.

The mystic artes are good, although limited in quantity. The Boost Strikes (which are essentially pair mystic artes) are also good.

Overall though this game lacks what older titles have (even in terms of the most recent titles) and therefore, FOR ME, it was a letdown.
Some of these include:
- Lackluster skits (I feel not only the quantity has decreased but its quality too. They're not as entertaining as older titles but also don't really develop the characters and their dynamic within the party which is one of the main features of this game series).
- The story is okay. Its not good but its not bad.
- Not enough meaningful party interaction. The filler content in-between big cutscenes, that are suppose to facilitate party interaction, really don't do it for me and feel quite mediocre.
- Fast travel points. They're littered everywhere pretty much, meaning at a point its not worth running through a ton of enemies to rest at a Campfire to potentially gain more (albeit also mediocre), cutscene times with the party members.
- Level grinding. To me it felt too much and some of the side content feels is too high for where you're suppose to be in the story.",1672041469,1672041469,False,4,1,0.544351041316986084,0,True,False,False

What makes me sad is knowing that the game ends. I am feeling empty right after the ending. Bittersweet is the perfect word to describe it. By the end of the game, I really want to see what happened with the rest of the team.

But yeah, here's my quick review:

- Gameplay

Is good. But I am not here for the gameplay. As long as it's not bad (annoying, random button mashing, or super timing and reaction based like Souls like game), it's passable for me. Typical JRPG. If you are here looking for something challenging, you can get it, just crank up the difficulty to something higher than Normal. I just wish the game explains more on Accessories and more accessible Light/Dark artes

7/10

- Story

This is the bread and butter of the series. The one that made me stay. At first, it's quite mid. But once you gather all the member of the team, things starts to get interesting. The male and female protagonist alone is not enough to carry the whole thing.

So what makes the story good? Noticeable character development, sense of grand scale conflict, the story makes you curious what will happen next, really keep you on your toes, and the skits (the animated comic strip) is truly a great way to build chemistry between team members in a form that is noticeable to us as players. 

Solid 8/10

- Graphics Quality

I am not playing it on the best hardware, but hey it works absolutely fine on mine. But the cutscenes are OK and the cinematic is top notch, on par with most AAA studios anime.

8/10

At least that's the experience of mine. Maybe if you play it on PS5/XSX/3080 PC+4K monitor, you will mark this as 9/10

- Technicality

I encounter zero bugs/crash while playing this game. Stable frame rate, except on the Water region, around the rain forest.

9.5/10

- Features/Things to Do

I am not the type of player who likes to 100% their game. I simply explore, fight, story. Repeat. I haven't even complete all of the subquest. I am not rushing it either, I think I still have 5 subquest left, but I finish the game because I am too curious with the ending. 
And yeah, like other JRPG games, they also have... Fishing. No date sim or something like that. The love story between each character is already pre determined. No harem bs. Besides, it's NOT a romance story. I just wish they could add more cutscenes after beating the game, like how each region fares post-ending. Or give us a tease, MCU post credit style, on possible sequel of this game, because I can still see possible sequel (or DLC) out of this game. 8/10

Overall??? 8/10

I am not the type of guy who will do NG+. I want to redo this game, but without the knowledge of knowing the stories, ending, etc. I simply want to experience the whole thing from the beginning.

The thing that I find lacking in this game that prevents it from getting 10/10:
- The story is good, but by the time you reach the credit, you will realize ""ah just another Shonen anime"". If they attempt to use another possible ending to the conflict, the one that is not so lovey dovey, then it will be solid 9/10
- Too much plot twist. Like you think this guy is the big bad guy, then there's another big bad guy, and so on. That alone is forgiveable, but they keep adding unnecessary shocker even till the end. That last Vholran appearance? Absolutely unnecessary.

Well, that's it for me. If you are a gamer that love stories, I recommend this game. If you are here for gameplay only, I still recommend it, but I guess you will enjoy Elden Ring more than this.",1671983960,1671983960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
740130,129259314,76561198091547937,0,1,3022,0,3022,1671922634,"I'm ""meh"" about the game overall, but between the two choices, I'm more of a thumbs down. I completed it for the sake of commitment, but I was inclined to give up maybe a third of the way through until things became more tolerable. I was a teen when I played Symphonia and Abyss, so I'm definitely out of the intended demographic now, and I'm not as big on the anime style of characterization as I used to be, so keep those points in mind.

The Pros:
- New features allow the characters who aren't a part of the active combatants to participate. It's a fun direction for the franchise.

- The romantic setup between the leading man and woman is pretty creative. Those who are into that aspect of the story will probably enjoy it.

- While the first part of the game does suffer from pacing issues, they at least kept it creative.


The Mehs:
- I found the leading man, leading woman, and the mage to be annoying up until their epiphanies. I understand why the latter two behave the way they do, but they still frustrated me. The leading man is just an idiot for the first half, and sometimes his overreaction to certain events seemed, well, over the top to the point of sounding contrived (I was using the English voices - maybe the Japanese actors were better in those instances). All this said, I'm not as big on the anime style of characterization as I used to be, which no doubt plays a part in how I feel. Others will probably enjoy them more.

- I found the story to be relatively simplistic; it lacks the same level of intricacies and enjoyable twists like what Tales of the Abyss had, for example. Those who don't need a lot of depth to enjoy a story will be more content.



The Cons:
- At least at first, the premise seemed glaringly odd to me. Everything is thought out, but nothing starts to be explained until halfway through the game or so. Again, the pacing isn't great in the beginning. Others might be okay with the long wait, but I became iffy because everything seemed overly simplified and almost like a bad revisit of Symphonia until they finally revealed the necessary details.

- Grinding is necessary, at least if you are playing above story mode, but better players might feel differently. I started on normal difficulty, and despite fighting every encounter, I still found myself having to grind, because the bosses were always like five levels higher and would own the party, despite them being the same level, or higher, as the map's monsters, or I'd get to a new segment of the game where the new monsters would see a similar bump in levels. Spending 2+ hours trying to become strong enough to progress the plot is not how I like to spend my time in a story-heavy game, so I gave up and dropped down to story mode. I didn't have to grind beyond fighting every encounter, but even on that mode, the combat became a challenge toward the end. It gave me the challenge I needed without wasting my time, but those who want a ""true"" story mode might feel differently.

- Dodging feels clunky compared to other games, in part because the mechanic isn't explained very well. and it seems like the game won't allow it based on factors like distance from enemies. Better players might feel differently, but I struggled with the timing between the button press and the joystick tilt for a good part of the game. 

- A lot of the cutscenes cause the game to spam the player with 3-5 skits at a time. I generally enjoy that aspect of the franchise, but it quickly became a nuisance to me. I didn't want to ignore them outright, but I also disliked the feeling of being given back control, only to be inundated with even more content.",1671983258,1671983258,False,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,False

The seven hours I put in are still firmly in the ""opening hours"" of this series and genre, but both the story and combat were so one-note I didn't see a point in continuing.

I did really enjoy the art style and the general feel of the combat, though. I would have tolerated the tropey and bland story if the early skills you unlock changed the combat in any meaningful way. I would swap attacks I had equipped and unless it was a projectile vs melee attack it was hard to tell if I had changed my loadout properly. Ultimately it felt as though I was only ever just hitting, evading, and then waiting for the ""big attack"" gauge to fill. 

If you've got a severe action JRPG itch to scratch there's definitely worse ways to do that.

Would I recommend this game? Sure! But not as a ""Tales"" game. ""Tales"" fans have certain expectations that this game will simply not hit. However, if you come to it as a standalone title and play it as its own JRPG, it definitely hits the mark. Don't expect a mindblowing story, and don't expect to be moved to tears, but you will have some fun if you like RPGs and a little bit of challenge. (I played on the hardest available difficulty just to keep it interesting).

The storytelling is just plain bad, and I've played free games that had better. Seriously, I can't imagine whoever wrote this crap is any older than 10 years old, due to its excessive amount of contradictory plot and interpersonal elements. The world doesn't contain any immersion whatsoever, as there clearly wasn't anyone with half a brain at the beginning of the game's development making sure that implications and connotations had the same theme.

The magic system is about as complicated as the creativity of an average six year old could come up with, so at least that's a positive.

I got this on sale, and the price is 0% worth it, but I fell asleep while playing, so its over the time limit. If this went on a 99% sale so it goes from $33 to $4 or so, instead of its normal $86, then I'd still hesitate to recommend it as there are other games sold for less with a more interesting magic system and a more believable story.

The core gameplay which is battle start out good and smooth if you do it well can play almost like devil may cry, until the boss fight which immune to stagger so most of the combo cannot apply at all, end up you just spam the highest damage skill over and over.

on leveling system they cut off portion of leveling scaling to make it sell as DLC, so on normal difficulty and above you always behind level of normal monster which cost you extra grind to progress even mainstory, the falling level getting higher gap as you progress until a point you will stuck 1 place for long time.

Also because of poor boss design and level gap, end up your boss fight either impossible to win or too easy because you overleveled, and your teammate AI is dumb so mostly die on boss 1 skill, if you dont want them to die you only can set them dont attack at all and focus dodging. you can youtube and see those pros do high difficulty boss fight which most of them make ai dont move and only control 1 character do some cheese move, which kinda suck a boss fight only can win like this instead of worthy challenge.

Pros:
+Combat is my favorite part of the game, liked it way more than previous titles
+Decent story
+Lovely characters
+Nice looking graphics & environment
+Good music
+Great voice acting

Cons:
-3D skits, it's the first time they doing this and I don't quite like it. I preffered the 2D anime portraits style like the old days
-In-game cash item promotion (like smh this is not an mmo)
-Boss can get too tanky in early game (the 2nd boss for example, without proper equipments, it's hard to deal with its ultimate attack, annoying af)

(SPOILER)
[spoiler] 
-The change of pace in the half of the story is kinda meh for me. The first half is about racial war and liberating nations, then it turned to alien sci-fi sh*t, at least it got some good romance
-Main villain is just an angry dude wanna rule the world or something idk, don't care

I liked the game and would recommend it with other, HOWEVER...

A big let down for me is the game's monetary system.It isn't pay to win but, about midway through the game money to buy items becomes important enough that you quickly realise you have two options, buy in-game money with real money or grind excessively. This is especially annoying if you are trying to do the sub-quests involving more difficult enemies, of course you could push on with the main game and reach the point at which money is easy to come by, but by that time you will have levelled up enough to essentially invalidate the sub-quests and their rewards that you needed the items for in the first place.
As an example 1xOrange Gel, an item that is especially useful, costs 3000Gald, most items you can sell mid game aren't worth more than 200Gald. So you will need to go through around 5 or 6 battles to afford 1xOrange Gel, and it is probably better to have more than one, plus some other items, meaning you could easily grind 50 or 60 battles to get a good stock of items.
Don't get me wrong, I like item scarcity as a way to increase difficulty, however the way this works makes the mid-game irritating and potentially grindy, in a way that screams ""buy some Gald and enjoy the game or learn to dislike the game by grinding"". This is made very clear by the 100,000Gald pack you can buy which in grinding terms would be around 120+ battles, by which time you will likely have grown bored of the game.",1671543671,1671543671,True,9,1,0.584111630916595459,0,True,False,False

I don't remember much about older games from the series, but this seems about as good as it usually gets. That said, the story kind of lost me after a certain point, but I still remained curious enough to care about the game.

There is half a dozen of difficulties. I originally started on Hard, but dropped to normal over time. In the end, I 
ended up just playing the rest of the game on Very Easy. It just didn't feel worth being on a higher difficulty. It didn't feel more fun or rewarding, as things were simply 2-3x tankier, which made bosses with adds really annoying. I don't know, most encounters felt like a waste of time, before late game. Additionally, there is no Achievements tied to difficulties anyway.

The combat experience felt a little bit clunky, as you cannot cancel animations to dodge out of the way, and since most bosses have non stop Super Armor, you're not going to be doing big combos on them in general. Things can get a bit hard to see during certain bosses with an humanoid model due to all the flashy animations. That aside, the combat was still enjoyable, especially when all features have been unlocked and you learn to play around them. My favorite thing about the combat system was actually leaving combat, that was very smooth. 

The game felt very comfortable using Mouse & Keyboard. I did change one keybind after a while, as I currently have trouble pressing CTRL comfortably with my current set up (put ""alternate"" on RMB since I use Shift to dodge anyway).

It was a great game overall. It has its issues, just like any others games, but it was still a pleasant experience.

2. Combat is very fast and fun, it requires you to read enemy movement and act accordingly. The setback here is with the amount of visual effects and the extreme number of things happening on the screen, making it hard (and sometimes impossible) to read enemy movements.

Typically when I play stuff I either finish it and enjoyed the game or drop it having not liked it. This one however I played all the way to the end, but am fairly on the fence on whether or not I can recommend it.

The game itself is overall decent but it does have a few issues that really hurt it. If you've looked online you've probably seen a lot of them already but they are the overall pacing, and the general gameplay. The story is decent, but if they had just not repeated themselves constantly I would probably say it was good. Overall I enjoyed the story and it was the main reason I actually finished it. The characters are great and personally I would love to see a second game with them again.

 The gameplay itself is.... not great. At first I loved it, and the pacing was wonderful but then I hit 25 hours. After that point the game started to overstay it's welcome. Though the whole game it pretty much forces you to be underleveled even if you explore everywhere and do all the quests. The exp rate actually decreases if you get too far ahead of where it wants you to be. I'll be honest, I am a massive causal when it comes to games. I play on the easiest difficulties and mostly play for story. The second half of this game almost broke me. Everything starts to take of chunks of your health, and it feels like you're punching brick walls even on the easiest difficulties. If it wasn't for one character's healing ability I would have quit halfway. The combat itself isn't interesting enough to last the 40ish hour story because it doesn't really evolve at all. Part of jrpg's fun factor is feeling improvement and this game just doesn't have it.

Overall I enjoyed the game but teeter more towards not recommending it, especially for other gamers like myself that tend to be more casual. The story is good, but could due with some trimming. The characters are amazing. The art style is fucking outstanding as well as the soundtrack.

- Story is pretty good, a tad bit predictable I'd say, but overall pretty good

Pros:
-Combat's Fleshed out and there's almost 0 grinding needed for the game
-Character design is aight
-The Environment and Setting is gorgeous
-First Half of the story's decent, tolerable at worst.
-Cinematics in JRPG standards is astonishing. 
Cons:
- The game slaps you with a ""WE HAVE A DLC AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY IT"" in the menu as it will keep on giving a notification.
- Cosmetics in this game is very limited unless, you guess it, DLC. Which is fine and all, but compared to previous tales games wherein they just give it to you through challenges and collectibles, the dlc practice is kinda douchy
- Last DLC rant, the game locked some combat artes onto some DLCs. 
- Plot turns from compelling Racial War in the first half, to a 15 hour information dump about sci-fi bullshit at the second half. The game's plot did not contain its scope to the point that everything that happened in the first half is almost irrelevant.
- Even though the game gives enough optional information to clarify some plot points, there's a LOT OF plot devices that's unexplained, underutilized, or just forgotten. 
-For a Tales game, it is too easy and dialing up the difficulty further from hard will only give enemy boss higher HP since you're most of the time 1-shot in hard with reckless abandon artifact (Artifact that boosts damage dealt and damage taken by 100%)
-Boss' are tanky af. Had to equip reckless abandon as soon as I got it.
-The combat system has a elemental weakness exploit mechanic which is kinda out of place for its combat since you exploit enemies with your companion's boost attacks

Overall, the gameplay carried my whole experience, but the second half almost ruined it for me. Post game is also fun, but short. I hope that they flesh out the story and combat sytem more in the next tales games like Berseria

Normally I'd leave it there but I feel the need to elaborate as this game seems to have come under some harsher scrutiny after its' initial honey-moon period.

Firstly even ""good"" layered characters are arguably cliche in one way or another. This is because tropes and stereotypes trace directly back to very human cultural patterns and lived experiences. Regardless I ended up in love with these protagonists and I don't award such praise lightly. There have been rpgs I played where I appreciated the mechanics and settings but the main cast  grated on my nerves. (Star Ocean Last Hope being a prime example) That doesn't happen here. There is not a single party member I found to be annoying or unnecessary. Between Arise and Valkyria Chronicles 4 I feel as if I have been ""spoiled"" when it comes to memorable likable companions!

A point of contention for some people are the villains in Arise are earnestly evil. Unlike the villains in Berseira that had low-key redeemable qualities mired in shades of grey,the Renan lords are mostly soul sucking cackling tyrants that delight in the suffering of others. (For nothing more than political gain among their own people) Let me add there's something refreshing about such brutal honesty! When the baddies do not justify anything they do with convoluted mental gymnastics pertaining to a variation of the greater good. Sometimes even in real life an individual is ""vile"" with no underlying deeper context. Not every antagonist needs a sympathetic backstory to be interesting. Obviously if you prefer your villains to be oddly endearing or to be misunderstood outcasts unjustly wronged by their own societies this may fall short hitting that particular benchmark.

Now,let us move on to specifics shall we?

1. Combat

Arise's combat has everything you could dream of. Launchers to set up enemies for pummels on the way down. Team attacks between the varied protagonists. Flashy finishers. Specific techniques that break an enemy's concentration or defense. Magic spells that can be charged or combined with other mystic arts for when you want to fill the screen with nonsensical eye-candy doing ""big number"" damage. It is all there at your command! As with Beseria, it still feels like ""Devil May Cry"" only instead of Dante fighting solo Trish,Lady,and Vergil are fighting alongside him simultaneously. I've used this analogy before and it is still apt here. Keep in mind that I tend to play Tales Of games on very easy. I do this because I've seen complaints about enemies being insufferable damage sponges that spam high-damage area-attack-B.S. No thanks! That kind of ""challenge"" never appealed to me. Your mileage may vary! (And luckily you can adjust difficulty on the fly whilst saving anywhere!)


2. World

You spend most of your time in the five realms,each with a different elemental theme. These biomes are often beautiful,vibrant,and filled with meticulous details. That being said,do not expect them to be the gigantic sprawling wildernesses in an Elder-Scrolls game. They tend to be compact with side areas that loop back around to a centralized hub or that eventually lead to a dead end. However each environ has hidden items,plants,and ores to scavenge so it is worth it to deviate a bit from the main path. These components will be essential for crafting better gear as well as cooking dishes that give you helpful stat bonuses. (I also like the more futuristic Renan strong-holds that are high-tech. They have that classic Phantasy Star feeling!)  


3. Sound/Voice

A few battle themes remind me of Wild-Arms or Y's for some reason. By the way,that's a compliment!  The voice acting is very good too so its' a bloody shame that some of the lip syncing is really off whilst certain side characters moan,sigh,or say only one word before everything transitions to text-only. But I understand. If every line was spoken the devs would have to pay a small fortune to the VAs which may have set the game back in other areas. Every project is done on a budget. Nuff said.


4. Character interaction

As before,Tales Of Arise often uses optional skits with character-art stills in a comic-book style to fill in what the protagonists are thinking and how their relationships are developing. Beyond the occasional slip with lip syncing,misspelling,or dialogue goofs where lines get spoken by the wrong speaker the presentation of skits has gotten much better.

However,I have noticed younger rpg fans take issue with this. At least I hypothesize they are younger as the Tales Of series has used this technique for many of its' main-line entries. (It's not ""new"" or out of place for this franchise.)

Personally I do not see it as objectively right or objectively wrong. It's a subjective creative choice to convey the dialogue and friendly banter among the main cast. It is there if you want additional character filler and can be ignored if you do not. As such I don't understand the complaints...


5. The one bone to pick! (Sin of greed sabotages any attempts to chart new better frontiers and to exceed)   

Tales of Arise is a worthwhile fun adventure but it is also a harbinger for what J-rpgs are becoming as opposed to what they used to be. Imagine a whole other difficulty setting,certain powers,and items that help you accumulate money and experience more quickly put behind a pay wall! Sorry,but when did Tales Of become a mobile gacha game? When did extra outfits originally found in the game-world thereby rewarding players for exploration or fighting extra powerful side-bosses get sectioned off in a DLC market place? 

I don't have the money to continue to support such egregious nickel and diming tactics. Given our present economy I imagine the number of people who feel as I do will grow. I read certain reviews wanting to genuinely love this game but still gave it a ""thumbs down' due to the dubious piece-by-piece marketing. Those fans have every right to be upset even though I'm still recommending Arise as a good Tales Of entry overall.

Pros

+Best looking Tales Of in the series

+Good voice acting fitting each character

+The blend of fantasy and futuristic is chef's kiss

+Melodic soundtrack (Good use of the violin and choir chants especially)

+Fun frentic combo-tastic combat

+Save anywhere

+Adjust difficulty anytime

+Cooking and crafting are helpful and not too difficult to grasp

+Party member AI is competent and you have options when it comes to tweaking it for each individual character.

+Alphen is the best aspects of Cecil and Dragoon Kain fused together! (Final Fantasy 4 reference)

+Every realm has believable sociopolitical struggles holding up a dark-mirror when it comes to aspects of class,race,propaganda,indoctrination,slavery,witch-hunting,genocide,and tyrannical regimes.   

+Law,Rimwell,Shionne,Kisara,and Dohime all have their moments when they steal the stage. It's a good supporting cast of companions whom are not nearly as ""basic"" as they initially seem. 

Cons

-Paywall DLC highway robbery

-Lipsyncing and voice clips are way off during certain conversations

-While the main cast is relatable and very impressionable I find Berseria also extended good character development to its' npcs as well. So far there are not as many lovable side characters in Arise and that is too bad. (Still, my respects go out to Zephyr,Mahavar,and Migal!)

-There are ""three"" versions of the game with varying amounts of extra content so in my case it was easy to mistake a deluxe edition for a complete edition. Something similar happened to me when I picked up Soul Calibur 6. I really wish Bandai Namco would work on its' advertising and presentation to make purchasing their games less of a hassle. Seriously,why not just have a ""basic"" version and a complete version? Easy peasy and less room for error!

I was craving a new JRPG experience, and this is one of the higher rated titles of the past few years so I gave it a try.  To be fair, it's not terrible.  But it has too many critical flaws and eye-rolling moments.  Other reviewers have rightly called out the unethical DLC practices, so my criticisms will focus on other things.  

Problems with this game:

1. Overly gindy without paid DLC

2. Combat is decent, but has some critical flaws
     a. Locked animations for abilities means you can't cancel long attacks.  Enemies at end 
         game barely stagger so you are kind of locked to using shorter lasting abilities.  
     b. The worst flaw by far is how you can't choose who your companions attack.  Technically, 
         there are a couple ways, but one of them is on a long cooldown, and the other is too 
         cumbersome to be a valid method.  This matters because focusing on a single enemy at 
         a time IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE.  It shocks me that this was never addressed, or worse 
         that this was intentional game design.  

3. Story is made of typical JRPG stuff, overly complex and not very compelling.

4. Characters are bland, despite all the ugly crying and screaming. 
 
5. Anime and regular clichés everywhere.  Enemy appears just as you are about to acquire what you've been searching for to steal it from you, MULTIPLE TIMES.  You'll slaughter a hundred soldiers to get to the lord and then refuse to kill the lord for morality reasons.  

The combat kept me interested in this game until its flaws became too much for me to handle.  It is a shame because they are easily fixable.  However, there is no easy fix for the cheesy anime dialogue, unremarkable characters, and cliché ridden plot.",1670596004,1670596225,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Note to others looking to play this - if you plan to actually read and follow the story, I HIGHLY recommend taking the time to watch the skits in between battles. I did a play through with skits, and one just rushing through. Without the skits, the MSQ fails at really developing a strong connection to the characters. If you watch them, it adds a lot more context to things and makes the characters seem more natural and human. The bulk of the character development is hidden in those skits. And honestly, in the side quests too! The MSQ is good and solid on it's own, but it is majorly strengthened by taking out the time to watch through the skits. Plus, there is an achievement for watching a lot of them away! :)


Story:

I am not super well versed on the different Tales games, but I can say this is weaker material than previous installations. I don't want to say the story is bad, because it's not as though it's horrible, it's just not as well written as previous games. Honestly, the story kinda reminds me of generic YA fantasy books - which if you are an avid Tales fan you probably won't like. But for someone like me who used to read a lot as a kid and is now a burnt out adult who hasn't read a book or played a single player RPG in quite a while, it's been good. It just seemed to me like they were making a game that was less targeted to old Tales fans and was more targeted to younger players new to the franchise. All in all, I like the plot. The story is okay. The dialogue between the characters is sometimes on the cringey side. 

For the characters, it took a while into the game before I started to actually connect with / care for the different characters. So some stuff didn't hit as hard emotionally as I think they intended. They grew on me, but it was a slow process getting there. 

Misc things I do like:

There regularly are quests where you aren't given direction and genuinely do have to explore and navigate on your own, rather than the game holding your hand to the destination. Not to say there aren't quests that do give you the exact location, but those usually come after you've opened/explored the area anyway with the open quests.

When looking at the Map List it gives you a list of all the locations you've found (obviously) BUT it also has a little envelope icon shop up on the different areas so you know that there are side quests available in those areas. This is awesome for me as I usually like to circle back to old areas to pick up sub-quests before moving on to new places and I can easily tell where those quest givers are. 

After you've spoken with a random NPC, their conversation bubble turns blue with a check-mark so you know you already spoke with them. I like to talk to all the NPCs, especially after big events in the story line, so this prevents repetition on my part.

A shadow of your player icon on the map stays at whatever entrance you came from which helps when you're like me and are directionally challenged and faced with multiple pathways. 

There are multiple skits that you can watch as you journey on and, while they aren't all that lengthy or particularly well written, it helps make you feel connected to the different characters.

You can choose the person you default start as when entering combat, and that person can be different than the person you have selected to play as when exploring. So I love to fight as Rinwell, but prefer to wander around as Shionne, and the game allows you to set it up so you can do exactly that. 

All of the above items feels to me like the game is trying to encourage you to go out and explore outside of the main story and make it a little easier to do so.

Misc things I don't like:

The first thing you need to do when playing this game is to adjust your camera settings. Just trust me on it. I do not know what was in their brains when they decided the default camera settings. 

Combat is overly noisy with the AI shouting their artes and talking to each other. I love the little bits of side commentary but it can get annoying when you're in a long fight. 

Jumping outside of combat is weird. Sometimes there are items that require you to jump to get to them (not often from what I have seen so far) and the movement gets all clunky. And your character will continue to move forward sometimes after landing and you'll just walk right back off lol

Do you know that pose when you first open some kind of character / avatar creator where the person is just standing straight with their arms to the side, but not like close to their body but instead like a gentle lowercase T pose? There are a number of scenes where they have someone standing talking and posed like that. I don't know why it bothers me so much but it annoys me greatly. 


End Judgement: 

If you are going into this with an open mind and aren't clinging to previous Tales standards, and want a story that is basic enough to be an easy read but still have a decent plot, this is a good pick. I would recommend buying it on sale, though. I don't think full price really matches the quality of the game.",1669757372,1670457986,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-The story was mehhhhhh worsen than other series.

-the crafting some how make gearing up  boring,there no spacial def/attribute on armors and weapons you change it so often that you barely care for attribute buff. And DEVIL ARMS again?? so I need to grind every character to power up my best weapons??? in you devoid world??

The gameplay. Its visually appealing, but boring. They have so many characters and combos, but somehow they found a way to make the core gameplay boring after the first few fights. I thought to myself... maybe the bosses are better. They are not. The boss fights are the most monotonous bullet spongey fights ever. Don't play the game on a harder difficulty because it simply just adds more health, there is no change in enemy aggression or numbers, just more health.  Its annoying to get to a point in the game where you are ready for an awesome battle with some asshole that you want to take down, and its just a half hour rhythm game where they attack and you counter and there is not much else. You really don't need to grind levels which is nice because this gameplay is just not fun enough for the length of the game.

The story. Its Dark Souls. You go kingdom to kingdom getting this game's version of a Boss Soul. Now at each kingdom there are varying storylines going on developing the world and the characters that I did find very interesting. This game also doesn't pull its punches and will not shy away from just killing characters off which is really nice to see in a genre that doesn't typically do that. 

However the main reason I dropped the game was the main story.I don't know how far throughout the game it exactly is but around 16 hours in for me the game just drops in a character that is very obviously [spoiler] a discount Sephiroth, down to the long sword and the clothing choice [/spoiler] and thats when I realized I could just be playing better games. Nothing in particular about the story really encouraged me to keep going on and when the combat is also bland it makes a good combination to drop the game.

The simple slave life doesn't last long, however, as Aphid gets caught up in a rebel attack, and winds up joining the rebellion.

Aphid gathers companions along the way, and you wind up controlling a party of six, of which four at a time can take part in battles.

Not sure why a third of your team just sort of cheers you on as the others fight, but that's how it works.

It's a pretty solid RPG, though one with some things that I found really annoying, to the point that it felt tedious at times.  What things?  Glad you asked.

The characters are always talking.  You walk around doing your thing, then suddenly there is a cutscene where everyone has a chance for some exposition, as well as to feel emotionally torn between, well, it varies for each character, but they are all carrying their own dark secret or burden, and are prone to self-doubt to the point that it might be better if they gave up their quest to save the world and just start a therapy group.

This chatter doesn't stop even in battles, and every fight sounds like a crowded bar on a Saturday night.  On top of all that, there is a pop-up in the corner every so often that lets you know you can watch yet another cutscene, if you somehow desire more inane dialog.

But even with all of that, there is one thing that just really annoyed me more than anything.  It goes like this:

--ominous music--
A boss appears!
""We will get you, boss!""
""Mwa haha!  You will not!""
--Big fight scene--
The boss falls to his knees, gasping.
""Give up you bad bad villain you!  Don't you see how wrong you were!  I am not bad like you so I shall explain how you can be good, so listen up while I tell you!""
""Mwa haha!  You have talked so long that I have become even stronger!  Take this!""
--Next fight scene--
Boss dies.
""Huh, who woulda thought he was gonna regenerate like that?""

Well, I did, for one, because that has happened every single time we fight a boss, so maybe skip the lecture and just finish them off when you have the chance?  Especially since there is a recurring bad guy.  I mean, you totally know he does this.  Stop talking to him, he's not going to join your therapy group.

So take out a whole lot of dialog, and this would be a way better game, because everything else is pretty good.  You fight, you level up, do quests.  All the things you would expect.  Just be prepared for some of the most emo characters to ever grace an RPG.  No need to pack for the trip, because they will bring the baggage.

Characters have very nice interactions with each other that some are funny and even have a hint of romance which I find it rare it some jrpg games. 

As for some negative reviewers, I think they find this game difficult as they got used to generic jrpgs with unlimited or atleast 99 items you can use. I find having limited items to use in tales series is very refreshing as you really need to think how to manage or use your items in each battle.

I would have to compare the story to FF14, where it's a slow burn that feels daunting and unending but ends up growing on you by the end of it. 

This game doesn't re-invent the formula and keeps things relatively simple with a bit of depth to compliment the grind. Combat does become simplistic at times (and can become aggravating when you crank it up to unknown) but the fun is still there to be had once you find a comfortable difficulty.

Gameplay: Epic great and probably the best among JRPG's out there. 
Story: Great - Mid, it starts out great,fun and interesting and on 2nd half it turns confusing, fast phased and boring.
Worldbuilding: Great world, the transition from different Biomes are very nice and can ease boredome, some place specially on 2nd half are very bland and non-attractive environments. 
Characters: They are great yeah there's like 6 of them and you do get a lot of progress for them and have time to like them. 
  as for the villains or the bosses they are very lame and non-interesting and might as well be mobs specially the Volhran guy. Forgettable but he always pops up. they need to put better backstory for some of them cuz they are still renowned in the other world.

Replayability: Bruh this game could reach 300Hours in terms of replayability just from base game and not NG+. post game brings you back before beating the final boss which is like level 61. and you can go back to former places to do sidequests and finish a lot of stuff and the thing is you can farm and reach level 100 max with Ultimate weapons before going NG+ and you fight the boss before going again so you can just like 2 hit it. The thing I wanna say is the Post game should have a situation for us to see when the final big bad is dead just to check the reactions of the other characters in the overworld but nope just finish = end. Also the main thing here is that the game forces to keep going forward and if you're not that engaged on going back to former places you're going to finish the game without knowing about the former things you can do. 

Total score for me is 8.5/10 great JRPG, gameplay and good enough story, great for New players in the genre but gets progressively tiresome.

Other than that I really like the cast of Characters and their story, the flow of battle is quicker which is a positive in my mind. I'm recommending this because it IS a good game with great story, just not on par with the other Tales game I played (*cough* Berseria and Xillia 1).

- combat can be OK, but nothing special and I was even thinking of reducing it from hard to easy just to be done with it faster to continue with the story. Maybe it gets better in the future but so far it was mostly boring or OK
- also in combat it has a lot of stuttering (I'm not even sure if sometimes a freeze is intentional or a bug but it's really annoying when it happens multiple times in a interval of a few seconds, I'm not even sure what it happens anymore) 
- lots of useless repeated chatter, most of it during combat but it also happens while walking around. I wish they at least added an option to stop this
- poor graphics and animations. Lots of scenes where there should be fighting you just see people staring at each other but the background voices try to make the scene dramatic and it really fails because of the visual
- no ultrawide support, but I did found a fix online for this. It made the game better but the skits are not well done for this but better than having half of my screen just black. 
- also related to graphics there was a point in the story when a character had a speech that it was suppose to be in front of a audience but the game only showed an almost empty yard. 
This is where I actually skipped the cutscene, then after the fight after I just closed the game.

-English voice acting isn't great.
-99 Item Cap is locked behind a DLC.
-The main heroine is pretty much unlikeable for the entirety of the time I gave it, and companions are meh at best.
-No animation cancelling, and getting stunlocked occurs just as often as stunlocking

Overall:

Its definitely not the worst game I've ever played, but this feels like a game I'd pay $25 for, but they charge $60, plus $155 in DLC, locking some really basic quality of life features like MAX INVENTORY CAPACITY behind a paywall. The game is clearly built to be purposefully grindy to try and annoy players into buying their DLC. The combat is extremely close to fun, but the lack of move cancelling meant that combos i thought would break posture, once failed, basically takes the controller away from me for 5-10 seconds. I tried to give the game a good chance, but it feels like the character progression vs plot progression are incredibly different, one wanting to try and be a slow burn story, the other wanting to just rush through, and make the major bosses feel way too close together.

The few bits of decent writing for the characters can't overcome the world and plot the story throws out.

For battles the game provides an array of palette swapped enemies and boss fights that drag on far too long. You are offered the option to skip fights with enemies, but by doing so you will be rewarded not with a difficult boss encounter but a slog.

Basically, I struggled on the second major boss due to no way to recover CP (think of it as shared MP among all characters) so I booked it out of the dungeon to go back to the nearest shop keep to stock back up on consumables. To my surprise, you can't buy any items to recover CP. Okay, that's cool, a lot of JRPGs fo that. I socked up on healing items that were available to find out you can only carry 15 at a time... okay, that's cool too. Trials of Mana only allows you to use a limited number of healing consumables per battle so I can deal with that. 

I am pretty much against grinding in the early game so I decided to do the one thing I didn't really want to do, see if there is an item pack dlc so I can at least get some items to recover CP because thinking that $2-5 is fine to drop. Questionable, but fine. But then I check the DLC packs and... well... why does this exist for a single player game? A pack that unlocks item cap to 99 among increasing all stats. Another pack that doubles exp and sp gains. 

I've known Tales games to be particularly challenging because of how frantic the combat system can be, but all this tells me is that the game is horribly balanced for a vanilla playthrough and beyond grind. And to read that these DLCs are almost near essential to make it through the game, it really does reduces my motivation to play it to the end.",1669752251,1669752251,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Good graphics
-Good storytelling
-Major characters are all very likable and they all have huge amount of dialogues, the interactions between the characters are often entertaining to see
-Combat is satisfying, every character has their own playstyle, some of the party members are obviously a bit stronger than the others but overall their strength are quite balanced

Bad:
-Boss fight can be quite annoying as some of them have quite a difficulty spike, and they all have huge HP pool. DPS-checks which could lead to team wipe if failed, are quite common.
-Story is not bad but just OK, plot is overall quite predictable. There is also a big information dump in the later parts of the game, you really have to sit for 3 hours doing nothing but watching the characters talking non-stop, which really hurts the pacing of the story.
-There were many antagonists in the story but only about two to three of them were actually memorable and important.
-Gameplay loop is very repetitive

This game is still pretty good despite some of the rather obvious downsides. The story is completely unrelated to the previous games and so I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for JRPGs to play.

It took me an hour to kill the first boss, which felt like a fluke because the gun character is basically built to fuck him with his attacks being telegraphed usually about a half football field away, so you can just kite him to death in very boring fashion

The second boss I fought took another hour to beat and that felt like a fluke, because he has a bullshit AoE charge that likes to come in from outside the camera while you're trying to deal with the mobs he summoned in at the halfway point and EVEN IF you manage to kill those adds and dodge the bullshit charge, did your healer? because if she goes down AT ANY POINT it's a wipe, problem is that if you take control of the healer your main damage dealer gets himself killed and you end up in the same problem as the first boss, where you just kite the boss until it dies of boredom.

Finally I got to the third boss and it's one-shotting my healer and mage before I can react, and I seem to merely tickle his healthbar

OH and the glowing weakpoint? not a weakpoint. Yes, it will *eventually* break which puts the enemy in a ""downed"" state for all of .5 seconds before it gets back up and returns to normal, so don't go swinging and positioning for the weak point thinking it helps, it doesn't

Oh a side note, on the second boss I also noticed my mage and healer were using things the boss had resistance to, so I set them to use only attacks it was weak to if they had them, virtually no difference in damage or ease of fight, not sure why I bothered truthfully

Additionally, the story seems like it *might* be going somewhere, but I'm in the second zone and these characters are being surprised by things they should have no business being surprised by, or they keep re-hashing the same fucking beat over and over again. I get it, you two hate each other, just fuck already and get on with your lives.

All in all, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who values their time in any real capacity. if you MUST know where the story goes just fucking youtube it and you'll have a better experience.

No character customization, if you're running around as another character they still refer to you as the main guy, and aiming / targeting feels jank.

The last thing I've run into so far thats bugged me is the skill pallet where you pick and choose what abilities to 1 of 3 buttons.
Its incredibly annoying with just one pallet and nothing more cuz that means you can only use 3 of the many abilities with easy access the rest you might want to use you have to pause the flow of combat and tab over to specifically choose what you want to use.

The game is fine especially if you like instance based combat games or the tales series in general but idk, running around I've got this constant nagging in the back of my head like ""Dang, dragon age did this better""

The positives first, this games combat system and visuals is just outstanding. At some points it hardly felt like I was playing a traditional tales game, combined with flashy finishers and the smoothness of character control makes you really want to beat up everything. Story and characters were amazing, besides one and you can find out why when you play it.

The AI in the game either behaves really good or really bad, I had many fights where my companions die instantly due to their decision-making RNG, there is a strategy system but I find even setting a great strategy the AI still can make grave mistakes. I'm not sure how I feel about CP in the game either, which if you played any other tales game that is this games mana system. There is a dungeon late in the game that shreds through your CP without any refreshes and very late checkpoints, causing you to annoyingly walk back through the entire dungeon... but at-least most of the game doesn't have that issue.

[u]To sum it up:[/u]
+Great story, good music.
+Bonding events which are really just skits you can view every once in a while.
+Engaging side-quests, and entertaining but some of the most stressful post-game content because of a specific quest.
+Amazing graphics with the new engine.
+Flashy and smooth combat abilities, that make you want to fight more enemies.
+Entertaining main cast that keeps you engaged during their physical and emotional struggles.
-The AI is a little on or off with their decision-making, causing some frustrating moments.
-CP, which in my opinion is an amazing idea for boss fights not regular mob fighting.
-A meh character later in the game, I can see why they put them in the game... but in my opinion the worst character by far in this game.
-There are translation issues on some dialogue, but it really isn't that serious I still enjoyed playing.
Tales of Arise is an exceptionally good JRPG, with an amazing cast and a cute owl. If you want an engaging and fun JRPG to try and play, I would highly recommend this game. I did my entire play-through on moderate difficulty, which I feel is the best difficulty for general balance or if you want more of a challenge than what normal gives you.",1634035473,1669433613,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I had no issues with the settings whatsoever, which doesn't happen that often with games that see a console release as well as a PC one. Very happy to be able to NOT have to go through NVIDIA control panel for a change. 

As for the story, it's quite good so far. I'm barely 5 hours in and I have laughed, cried and twitched from being nervous during boss fights. Difficulty settings appear to be very well balanced, too... so whether you want to follow the story or have a challenge, both are actually possible.

It pains me to assert this, because I truly love this series, but it shows a real lack of growth in many aspects of the franchise by still having problems I've noticed in games from over a decade ago. In the Tales fandom the game is generally considered ""In Name Only"" which I find completely ridiculous, it's VERY in name, having trademarked Tales flaws all the way around. The biggest and clearest one is the game's narrative, which hobbles its way through poorly handled racism (and later classism) allegories, weirdly outdated depictions of women and their mental health, and pacing that feels like it's both trying to win the Olympics and turn into a snail. The game both tries to tell a dark and complicated story and spell out every simple moral with repetitive language. (Seriously the early game will repeat the same five things to you over and over per area). The character relationships are flat and samey, the only dynamic that slightly alters is Shionne and Alphen but even then it's the same thing on loop for most of the game. The gameplay itself is a fun evolution of the behind the back games in the series, but it has a lot of faults (most likely due to rushed development). The character balance is really wonky, certain characters like Alphen and Rinwell feel far more thought out than others like Kisara and Shionne (Shionne herself doesn't even get an arte that puts her in the air despite being designed for aerial enemies, meaning her AI won't ever use aerial artes). The bosses are infamously awful to deal with, being genuinely unfun at points with how hard they hit and how hard it is to interrupt them. Half the time big spells will lead to enemies walking right out of them, and a lot of more powerful artes lock you in their fancy animations, leading to you getting flattened (especially so for the AI). If you just want to play as Alphen and don't want vastly interesting storylines, then you might enjoy this game, but overall there are better generic game experiences out there for you that are far cheaper and don't require DLC to gain entire artes. It's with a heavy heart that I'd say just wait until there's a sale and if you're really curious, watch the cutscenes on youtube, (they aren't worth it).",1658381982,1669257561,False,9,0,0.569715797901153564,1,True,False,False

The story start out as the classic collect 5 crystal and save the world type story but evolve with a few twist in later part of the game. The story is not masterpiece but great enough to get me hook the entire time. Because this is standalone game with standalone story without sequel or prequel, the lore is not rich like trails series but good enough to cover the main story. 

The romance part between the two lead is very good and feels natural. They banter back and forth, argue, reconcile and support each other in entire game. Same thing can be said with others party member as well. There is no Harem trope or love triangle bull$hit here which is big plus for me. Each party had their own pairing and doesn't have conflict romance. This game have conclusive romance which is pretty rare in JRPG nowadays and the ending wasn't left open ended too which is a great. Its very satisfying and make the journey worth it. For those who are concern about bittersweet or depressing ending from past tales of game, rest assured because you will get a good feeling ending in this one. [spoiler] The main couple even kiss and get married by the end of the game. [/spoiler]


The interaction between character is really good and make the journey feels alive and fun. The party keep bantering and talking with each other in skits even chit chat about day to day topic (fishing, cooking, laundry, clothing, idle chat, etc.) They even make a comment or two everytime you encounter something new or unusual on the road. They also have more dialogue for you when camping. I sometime rest at the camp and do nothing just to see character camp idle animation lol and the camp interaction is evolve each time new party is recruit and the character relationship progress in story. All this small interaction make the journey more fun and alive and serve to lighting up the mood of the game because the story can get pretty dark sometime. I literally drag the game before finishing it because I don't want the story to end and want the journey to continue a little while longer and end up finishing the main story at 125 hours mark. Even after that I still got a lot of post game content to do and skit to discover.

The combat is very good and responsive and the combo is not too complicated to execute. I play the whole game in hard mode and the combat can be brutal sometimes in early game but get more easier and fun in mid to late game because you unlock a lot of skill and perk and can chain more combo. The party combat role is pretty different from each other so if you bored of one character you always can try the other 5. The game run smoothly in my 5 years old pc (GTX 1060 6GB and I5-7400) and runs 60fps entire time and only dip sometime when battle got intense with lot of magic animation going around.

All in all Tales of Arise is very Excellent game and my best game of this year (2021) . Must play if you fan of JRPG.

While I do like the presentation, battle system (when it works), VA work, animated Skits, and the generous fast travel and item gathering systems, I find I have a lot of gripes in other areas. My biggest gripes have to do with the story and battle system. 

The story feels very contrived and predictable to me personally. I never quite connected to any of the main cast and felt everything was, for lack of a better word, ""anime"". I also didn't like how the big ""twists"" were thrown in so heavily at the end. For me, it felt like it happened just because the story needed it to, as opposed to actually making sense. Also, if I think ""Wow this is just like another Tales of game"" there may be a bit of an issue. The story isn't bad nor is it good. The saddest thing about the story is that it's bland.

Battles are fun when the systems fall into place and everything is flowing nicely; however, I found that the dodge mechanic and monsters telegraphing moves never clicked for me. I wish there was a more generous window for dodge cancelling. Also, especially during boss fights, so many things would be happening that it was nearly impossible to tell what was happening. I found myself mindlessly dodging simply because I didn't know where an attack was coming from or what was happening next. It didn't feel fun to beat a fight it just felt relief that finally it's over and I can slog to the next area. On top of that, there are just too many battles and regular mobs are far too spongy. In a 40-50+ game you know you're going to be battling a lot but each battle can take a good chunk of time and there are just so many. No matter how good a system is, if the battles get too repetitive it really wears you down in the long run. Honestly, near the end, I found myself running form bigger fights just so I didn't waste resources/time fighting the mobs.",1669200515,1669200515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-----------------------
(Cons)
*Cliche story with out spoiling much Racism is bad. You'll figure this out in your first 5 minutes. its the side stories that matter and make the plot better

*You'll find what skills (artes) work best for which ever protag you main and end up spamming it. for hours... Yes you have a GIANT list of skills but about 3 of them are really bread and butter(Raining slash) while the others end up falling flat due to damage.

*Some of the stronger skills(Artes) and passives are locked behind dlcs. (Schoolgirl/Beach/Waring States).  Petty imo

*The voice acting in English is hit or miss, You'll constantly hear the whole party shouting out the skills including you. this was not bad at first but after hours and hours it will sort of grind on you. (this has always been a tale series issue)

*Party AI for certain characters (mainly Law) and (Kis)  wont use them to the full potential, law especially will be taking naps during your fights.  Kis however will get better. 
-------------------------
(Pros)
*The party banter is pretty good and is guaranteed to make you chuckle a few times
*The side stories tie very well into the main which end up fixing a lot of whats wrong with it
*Very flashy finisher skills. Never got tired of them.
*Plenty of content here, Bosses/Side Bosses/Temple/Dungeons/Sidequest.  you will get your moneys worth and lose hours.
 *Hootle, the asshole owl
*Some nice cosmetics. Like the way the older sword looks compared to your new one? dont fret. you can reskin your new one with the old.
*Interesting hurt yourself for more damage mechanic for Alphen

7/10. Linear exploration, decent story, repetitive combat but a lot of excellent quality of life features

So many times in the first few realms I nearly stopped playing, the story was painfully predictable, the MCs were annoying as hell and the fighting was extremely repetitive. However I stuck with it and I'm glad I did as the story really came around and I thoroughly enjoyed the ending and am considering a new game + (discount the hours played, I left it on overnight quite a few times during cutscenes or boss battles).

I will start with the negatives.
The enemy design is repetitive, same sprites different colour, add to this that particularly at the start when you have a limited selection of moves, the combat is VERY samey. Bash, bash, uppercut, aerial attack bash – boost if you have it – repeat. Later on, as you get more moves and the option to play as other characters in your team this is alleviated somewhat but honestly every fight feels exactly the same. The boss fights suffer from this too, just bash with whatever appropriate element, dodge, heal, repeat, they are always a boring slog (especially the late game optional bosses)

Most of the voice acting is decent but some of them are jarringly bad (looking at Kisara and Almeidrea and maybe even MC)

Character development is good overall, excellent even in some cases but one character in particular (a young person – can’t say more for spoiler reasons) is terrible. Their personality does a miraculous 180° and suddenly they are on your team and it’s just jarring.

Positives
After an initial slog the story takes a twist and it improves dramatically, it follows through to a pretty great ending. If you play RPGs for the story – stick with it, it’s worth it!

Visually it’s a great game, the combat visuals in particular are excellent. The skits (small conversation pieces with your team) are cutely done and the worlds overall are easy on the eye. There are also a few anime cutscenes throughout that are well done.

What really impressed me about this game were the quality of life aspects. You can pause during cutscenes and combat. Cooking provides concrete benefits. You can fast travel. During the fishing mini-game you can see which fish you have already caught at each location. You are rewarded for exploring every nook and cranny – You can tell this isn’t their first game, they put a lot of thought into the user experience and it works really well.

What kept me from quitting after about 40% completion was the discovery of the fishing mini-game. I was just about to quit when I discovered it and got hooked (sorry, not sorry). This provided a welcome break from the combat slog. (Ironically it is straight after the discovery of the fishing game that the story starts speeding up a bit and becomes less predictable)
The fishing game is very well done and there are some excellent benefits to catching the fish whether it be monetary, culinary or XP boosting

The crafting is also well handled, towards the end of the game you can take a break from the slog to spend some time crafting some excellent custom accessories for your team. You can transfer excellent abilities from one accessory to another building towards an ultimate accessory. I spent a good bit of time on this and thoroughly enjoyed it. The weapon crafting is simple by comparison – have materials, make new sword – no customisation.

I got the deluxe edition on sale which came with some currency so I was never broke which seems to be a common problem in other reviews.

Overall I enjoyed the game, however I am glad I got it on sale, the repetitive combat and enemies really detract from all the other good aspects of the game. 7 out of 10.

The story so far 8 hours in seems decent. skits what tales are known for are not really skits more comic book style and feel cheap and clunky.

the dlc obsession comes into play by the very grindy leveling and I am no stranger to grinding a map to level up but im 7-8 hours in and have just not long hit level 12 and finished the first boss who was level 15!. This does not bode  well for the rest of the game.

combat is a bit better but  for every positive they take 2 steps back. as for skills you need points this makes you grind for them in battles and certain skills only unlock depending on how many times you have used a ability. 

this game isnt worth 75 pounds i got mine on sale at 30.00 with some of the dlc none of which were for level bumping the characters  just temp boosts to exp and gold and costumes which makes it a insult as maybe not at the start but leveling later is going to be such a chore which is why these scummy level dlcs exist.

update.

Game runs very stable however my fears of this game being a absolute grind fest which is a real shame its a absolutely gorgeous game however its clear from the first 8 hours as i have said this game is designed to be as grindy as possible there are some artifacts that help ( barely) and recipes to boost xp dont come into the game for a good while.

xp gain is broken small example.

your party is level 7  the enemy is 10. lets say you get 500 xp from that.

well the moment your 1 level under them level 9. that xp goes to 50.

also ability unlocks go from 1 extreme to another where your forced to play mini fishing games or the arena to unlock skills  i hear you ask do you get xp for the arena ( of course not that would be to easy. what you do get is stupid costume packs and a few edible plants that will update your defense or attack by 5 or  10 points.

also noted solo battles in the arena unlock the skill trees not the group battles as each character needs to do this once or more.

also you will have to do side quests in order to unlock even more skills 
ahh but you will also have to battle and grind to even be able to put points into this as bandai gives you a small pittance of points for doing the quests.

also you will want to collect as much minerals and items  and rocks to make accessorys.

i recomend the vegetable soup recipe for better ore to make accessorys as youll want to collect as much ore the higher the number the better the stats this can be changed much latter in the game so you can customise the skills your accessory gives you e.g more attack but dont expect that unlock untill quite far in the game.

i have so far not used any eshop items apart from the ones given in the bundle of the game i bought.

i am not finished the game and have just hit around level 40-41. let that sink in ive been playing the game 65 hours. if i was to get rid of the grinding and side quests the games real lenght would be close to 25-30 hours maybe even less.

8 hours into the game i was level 12. the bosses levels im barely keeping pace with. 


I still dont recomend this game for its grindy practices this game is good as it was this is just greedy bandai etc trying to push people to a e shop.",1666234135,1668736713,False,3,0,0.533765614032745361,0,True,False,False

The progress of the Tales series is quite constant. Vesperia was very good, Berseria was very good (although a little long), but Arise is seriously the peak. Great characters, interesting plot and sub-plots, more side-quests and an easier to play ""action"" mode. The only possible evolution of this series is to move away from the usual ""pockets"" of enemies in the map to a real open-world (which they do, btw, in one of the dungeons!)

I have seen people saying the game is too hard, with DLC-centric economy that is hard to come by ingame. That is utter nonsensefrom people who don't get a single thing from Tales series. and by ~75% of the game I was so rich I couldn't care less about gald of items. You don't need to always have THE best equipment, just get the best you can afford, you will often find even better in chests, or large sums of gald.The dificulty is all about which characters and skils you use, your gear doesn't play that much unless you are still using your first gear at the final battle.

I brazed through the game with NO DLC, playing as the story goes, and had near to no difficulty with any boss except one or two lords. Like ALL Tales games, there are some unique monsters (one very early in the game) that are there to scare you, but you are supposed (as any person with a brain would conclude) to return LATER, because its a lvl 49 mantis. Yet, I had no issues beating unique monsters that were 10 levels above my party, just need to learn how to play. 

Some grinding might be required if you don't know the game mechanics (like the exp boost you get if you fight mutiple battles fast), and you should know every mechanic of the game, which is simpler then Berseria.

Now my only real qualm about this game is how much dialogue you get near the end of the game, its like it turns into a playable movie. I would be ok with it if it weren't always the same subject, the characters are always rotating about the exact same subject and the extract Shionne dilemna so much that you stop caring.

The graphics are great, nothing to say in that regard. Story is your standard JRPG fare, not bad per se but it's not going to win any awards, and it comes with a boatload of cliches (whether this is good or bad is up to you). Character are decently likeable, and there's a crafting system that's not too annoying.

What will make or break the game for you is the combat.
The combat system is dynamic and satisfying. It's probably one of the best in the Tales series at least. You've got a string of basic attacks, and your special skills (called ""artes""). You can only do a certain number of attacks in a single string, and the artes use a rapidly regenerating ressource. The point is to coordinate between the different characters to string together a barrage of attacks, where once you've reached your limit (used all your attacks and burned all your skill points), another character is hitting the enemy so the combo doesn't break while you ""catch your breath"", so to speak.
Enemies initially resist your attacks, but after being hit enough their guard break and they start to get hitstun, hence the need to keep the combo up. On top of that, each enemy will have one or more ""attribute"" (flying, armored, casting, etc) and each character has a special attack that correspond to one of those attributes and will knockdown and interrupt the enemy when used.
The result is a combat system that's relatively simple to approach but actually has a good amount of depths, and results in flashy and impressive fights.

HOWEVER, there are a couple of decisions the devs have taken that ultimately ruin the experience for me and are the reasons I'm not recommending this game.

-They really wanted you to do combos. Understandable, since this is the point of the combat system. However, in order to do combos, you need an enemy to hit. And enemies disappear the moment they're killed, so you can't keep up a combo on a dead enemy. The result : every enemy is a big freaking sack of hit points. Every. Single. One. Even basic ones you fight by the dozen.
Now, combats are still relatively short, but they're involved. Even if it's just a random wolf identical to dozens of others I've already fought, I'm still going to need do my whole basic attack string and add artes to do a good 20 or more hits before it goes down. Sometimes, a trash mob is just a trash mob, you know? I should be able to down it in a couple hits and move on. But not in this game. Ya GOTTA combo.
It also makes you feel weak, as your damage number are very low and the enemies' healthbar are noticeably slow to diminish. Not a great feeling.

-For some reason, bosses (and any ""large"" monster) do not interact with that combat system at all. Because they are completely and utterly immune to hitstun, and therefore cannot be combo'ed at all. You CAN briefly interrupt them on occasion with the attribute special attacks I mentionned earlier, but those are limited, and once a boss gets low on health it becomes immune to those too. On top of that, if regular enemies are already sacks of HP, bosses put them to shame. As in ""the first boss has nearly 20K hitpoints when your attacks are dealing sub-100 damage each at that time"".
Also, they hit extremely hard, and you cannot cancel an animation, so using any of your stronger artes, which will typically have a longer animation, is therefore basically a death sentence. The end result is that oftentimes the best strategy for boss fights is to run like a chicken, pinging the boss with weak ranged attacks, sloooooowly whittling down its immense health bar, and throw a knockdown attack every now and then when it becomes available to get a second or two where you can actually hit it with your good attacks. It's baffingly different from the normal combat and typically not a good time.

-The AI is bad. You can customize their behaviour, but for some reason there are no option to setup the AI for each character individually, even though it's possible in other Tales game. Want to have your healer passively stay away from danger so they're able to heal the moment it becomes necessary? Great, your tank is now ALSO staying away from danger! Isn't that awesome?
And even beyond that, it's extremely limited. For example, there are two types of artes, ground and aerial ones. Well, the AI [i]never[/i] jumps. It's not too bad usually, since there are ground artes that make you jump as part of the animation, allowing you to string together ground and aerial artes for a combo, and allowing even the AI to get in the air to use aerial artes... for most characters. There's one who doesn't have any ""rising"" artes, and therefore will never use a good third of her arsenal if you let the AI control her. (Oh and she's the healer, so if you're thinking to just control her yourself to use her to her full extent, then congratulation, you now have to babysit a bunch of idiots).

-The game [i]heavily[/i] discourages grind by making enemies give greatly diminishing returns in terms of experience. The result is that you cannot grind to overpower the previously mentionned problems, or even simply because you enjoy it. Well, technically you can, but the exp slows to such a trickle that leveling up past the ""intended"" level of each area would be disproportionately long.

So in the end I didn't enjoy my experience with the game all that much, which is why I didn't recommend it. But if you've read my previous points and thought ""that doesn't sound that bad"" then by all mean give it a go, as I said at the beginning it comes down to taste in the end.",1668627323,1668627323,False,33,1,0.717482268810272217,0,True,False,False

The game feels very clunky in a lot of ways. The enemies who cant be interacted with, except for in a ""fight sequence"" kind of break the immersion since every fighting arena feels like just a big flat circle. The combat itself is alright but it doesn't feel like you can express your skill very much outside of just spamming abilities. 

The world maps feel like someone put most of them together in an afternoon without much though. Items are just classicly at the end of hallways or corners. Enemies seem littered around arbitraliy without much thought. The NPC's have little to nothing interesting to say, the attempt at world building was made half heartidly.

The story starts off strong and stays entertaining as the mystery is revealed piece by piece. What brought it down for me was the mediocre last chapter and the constant preaching about ""judging people by their actions, not their race"" (every character gets 10-20 mins worth of dialogues about this)
Characters were likeable and developed enough to feel like more than tropes, but when everyone has a dark and horrible past, it kinda loses its impact.
Graphics and music were fine, even thought the character models seem a bit outdated for a 2021 game.
Combat is fast paced and fun, except for extremely spongy monsters (most of them) and when large monsters have half their body hanging outside the combat area, often making reaching the weak point impossible with melee attracks.

It has all the JRPG-isms including using friendship to defeat evil and all that with a troupe of characters that span all of the common JRPG archetypes. The story and characters are nothing groundbreaking by any means, but well-executed and still entertaining with the interesting world setting and lore. The game looks absolutely beautiful, by far one of the prettiest JRPGs, and plays wonderfully with excellent action-combat built off of something akin to FF7R's ATB system where normal attacks will fuel 2 different resource types for you to execute more heavy-hitting special attacks. The combat also offers plenty of variety as you can tag in and out between characters on the fly to experience 6 unique and different playstyles. This makes it so that the game's combat never runs dry after its 40+ hour long runtime as you can always swap to a different character to tackle each encounter, even if the encounters themselves repetitive. I will say the game has a few major flaws:

1) The balance feels a bit off. Bosses are too spongey at the start and can be brutal with their Arte casts, forcing you to play around Boost Strikes perfectly. Shionne also struggles heavily with CP (basically mana) economy at the start. I highly recommend turning down the difficulty for the first few bosses as they feel heavily overtuned.

2) The end of the game has a very long, 10-hour ish walk-and-talk section that is a huge exposition/lore dump and plays more like a visual novel than an action RPG. It's a huuuuge dip in pacing and it feels like they ran out of time and had to hurry it up and deliver conclusion through dialogue dump. That being said, it's all worth it in the end as the ending ties everything up with a neat little bow.

3) The dungeons in this game are very, very long and encourage multiple trips back to the campfire to rest. This can result in repeating large sections of the dungeon as the enemies will respawn. However, to me this wasn't a huge issue as the combat was so amazing that I didn't mind beating up an extra 100 mobs rerunning my path towards the deeper parts of a dungeon, but it is something to note.

4) The dialogue interludes (""skits"" as they are called) aren't very interesting. There's some humorous ones sprinkled in, but largely they seem to rehash what you already know about the characters.

Overall, a very solid JRPG that has excellent combat but is held back by a few flaws. I would definitely say it's worth a playthrough. If anything, the visuals and combat alone are worth experiencing.",1668225537,1668225698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs did an amazing job with the core combat gameplay, every party member feels unique and fun to play in there own way. The story is pretty good, its not the best in the world but it's enough to get you to continue going on and seeing how the story unravels. The game looks really good for a JRPG, now a days JRPG graphics are hit or miss but this one got some really nice graphics. 

Let's move on to the issue of the game. This game has one core issue with it and it's simply the progression of the game. I'm playing through this game on the second hardest difficulty and iv noticed that the amount of exp you earn in this game is abysmal. At one point my party were requiring 4000 exp to level up and the highest area i could grind would give me 30 exp per fight. This was my only option as my party were level 16 and the main boss of the area was 16. I typically like being within 2 levels of bosses so i tend to grind within that 2 level range in any JRPG. The grind to get from level 16 to 17 was almost 3 hours long. The way the game wants you to level up is to buy DLC which is stupid. The DLC add bonuses for exp increasing the amount you get  per fight. I Simply refused to buy these bonus cuz it's stupid, a game should require dlc for normal game progression. Another thing to point out is how much they try to shove DLC down your throat, you can see tabs for DLC on the main menu, in game menus, and even resting locations!!! The game is constantly reminding you that you can be buying there DLC which is super annoying and intrusive.

Over all if you a fan of JRPG or the Tales franchises and can tolerate long grind session than this game will be great for you, other wise you will either have to pick up the DLC which is not included in the ultimate edition or simply not pick up the game. It's honestly a shame they lock normal progression through a pay wall since this game is really fun.

Combat plays very different from other Tales games with combos and special moves flying at almost all times, still fun to play but the NPCs can end up dead more often than not if you aren't careful with their health bars or don't character swap often mid combat.

The Story is incredibly weak though. The early game relies heavily on ""Slavery bad"" and absolutely races through the different flavors of slavery in each city. All the main cast felt flatter than boards to me with only a few standout moments from Kisara and Shionne.

Most JRPGs rely on it as a fallback in case the gameplay or visuals fail somehow.

Like Symphonia, parts of Phantasia, and Rebirth before it, Arise also follows with ""racism bad"" as a starter for Alphen and Shionne's quest to beat up the [strike]kid friendly, Dark Souls bosses/Lords of Cinder[/strike] five elemental based Renan Lords to free the planet of Dahna of three centuries' worth of slavery. Bonus, you also get some romance in there for extra motivational measure because it's so damn adorable to watch develop and unfold (it's well earned). Mind you, said average story does falter a bit in the second half of the game (it almost gave me Xenogears flashbacks) with quite a bit of exposition dumps as well as being slightly rushed in getting you to the final area of the game without tying up some of its loose ends. However, if you're invested enough in the characters to see how the cast fares in the end, it's worth it. Even if you do pick up on knowing where the story beats will go eventually, it shouldn't mar your experience. Side note: YMMV with the final boss, I personally didn't like how it was done, but the result was satisfactory in the end I suppose.

[h1]Now for the gameplay. [/h1]
Ngl, I was initially baffled I had a dedicated jump button or even an ""evasion"" button at all in a Tales game. Enemies appear on the map and in front of you (no random fights), combat is very anime flashy and bright, very fast paced with the stressed mechanics of dodging/counterattacking or ""Counter Edge"", even being outright required in some important battles. Beware, this has much tankier enemies than previous Tales games, especially the bosses whom you cannot stagger and later in the final area. CP or ""Cure Points"" acts as your healing pool and casted buffs such as Lionheart, Guardian Field, Steel, and Concentrate, so you can't attrition the enemy to death. Arise expects you to play well and do your best in evading incoming damage.

As it is in Tales tradition, there's party skits, cooking, in Arise' case the obligatory hot springs cutscene, post-game EX dungeon for higher level grinding, and cameo fights from other Tales characters. Like modern Tales games such as Vesperia (fusion of old and new), Zestiria and Berseria, you can craft new weapons with enemy loot drops. Once you've acquired a new weapon, you can use that appearance as a weapon skin if you  choose too without having to change out your current one (this is new).
Learning new skills/artes is either tied to completing subquests, overall artes proficiency categories (no longer tied to individual usage anymore), and character titles. Earning money is done through selling dropped enemy loot, completing subquests, or finding it in treasure bags/chests, not through simply harassing the local wildlife in battle. Items are expensive, especially for CP restorative items. Orange Gels don't normally sell for 3000 some Gald in previous games. EDIT: I forgot to mention that unlike previous Tales games, there is no internal way to play co-op with others unless it's through modding.

EDIT2: in some previous Tales games, there used to be a ""Grade shop"" you could spend your accumulated Grade from fights or minigames into NG+ activators for the next playthrough. This one instead has collectible artifacts related to other Bandai Namco games that stand in for those carryovers, such as items, weapons/armor/accessories, titles, etc. Some of them can be toggled, such as doing 1 damage to enemies for arte exhibition purposes.

[h1]Dat Sakuraba bassline[/h1]
Music's a bop, although I think there's some audio imbalance during cutscenes as sometimes it swells up too loud (I did this on 30/100 BGM volume and it was still loud). Could be me, could be the internal levels somehow, I'm not sure. Enjoy some Flame of Hope at least.

[h1]Do not bother with the DLC, not with those initial prices[/h1]
Even on a sale, they're priced a bit high, [i]especially the $28 Battle BGM pack[/i] (which should've been unlockable somehow on your own). What's sadder is how the costume packs come with extra skills linked to titles you cannot earn on your own in the base game. There's also P2W ones that jumpstart your early beginnings in the game that make you pretty OP initially, but peter out quickly. Only get them [b]on a very heavy sale, at least half off or more[/b].

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Yes, this game is geared towards newcomers to the series. Go play this on a discounted price, you'll like it. Personally I couldn't stop seeing Final Fantasy 4 parallels, but I'm weird.",1667259808,1667941609,True,56,3,0.80710601806640625,1,True,False,False

I was never a huge fan of jrpgs as most of the ones I tried were turn based and I don't really like vanilla turn based combat, or the combat system of games like neptunia. HOWEVER, this action combat, smaller maps making up a pseudo open world type of gameplay is just fantastic.

This game is brilliant, interesting characters, good story, entertaining combat system and beautiful graphics, with a lot of stuff to discover!
This game was so great in fact I bought the whole tales series on steam.

For complete transparency I bought all the games on sale, but I would gladly pay full price for them now.

Solid combo system that builds on similar mechanics from other games in the series that does unfortunately devolve into skill spam for (very satisfying) stagger-break mechanics later into the game as HP pools drastically outscale your damage. Understand that the game knowingly locks you into your Artes and does not allow you to cancel out of it as a form of punishment-based decision making, so install the mod if you're into more free-flowing combat.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Without diving too much into spoilers, what I've always enjoyed about the best Tales Games was the willingness to get into the dirt and explore darker elements that mainstream JRPGs stay away from, which changed heavily when Vesperia became a massive hit.

This entry is more or less in line with Vesperia in that it's not very interested in having real philosophical debates about the setting and background of the characters, and focuses primarily on the relationship between the two leads, and their supporting cast. Without spoiling too much, I will simply say that the conclusion is satisfying in a way most JPRGs aren't. 

[h1]Pacing[/h1]
That being said, the first 40% of this game is some of the best Tales has to offer in terms of pacing and production quality. The remaining 60% screams of shortened development time. The padding is strong for the second half, and there is a good amount of meandering before you are shoved towards the climatic showdown.

[h]Final Thoughts[/h1]
This is a Tales game for Tales fans. It's glossy, well-produced, and filled with a good amount of charm. It misses the mark with the second half, but strong characterization and a satisfying gameplay loop will carry you through to the end. 

While Tales is not known for their DLCs, this is definitely an entry where I would have loved to spend more time with the characters and the world in post-game content. Here's hoping the next one doesn't take another 5 years.",1667788704,1667788704,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Beautiful artwork, great combat system, and a fairly good story. The skits can get too fluffy and feel like unnecessary filler at times, but fortunately you can skip these entirely or watch them later at campsites through the “reminiscence” feature. The music is alright – literally “Back to the Future” the remix. 

As for the enemies and dungeon progression, the first half of the game was very enjoyable. It was a breath of fresh air to actually have to use items in battle and make sure to always be stocked up, rest and eat food properly, and plan how far to progress before resting at a camp site. As for the latter half of the game, it feels dragged out and long at times even after only playing 40 – 50 hours. This is because the enemies are HP sponges and take forever to down and combat becomes an endurance of how patient you are rather than actually having challenging combat. I actually turned the difficulty down during the last dungeon to make the game go by faster. The last dungeon also had uninspiring visuals, which made it feel that much longer. However, if you can get over that, then this may be the game for you. 

The game was not bad by any means and I do not regret the purchase (bought it on sale), however, thumbs down because I feel there are better modern JRPG options and I wouldn't recommend buying at full price.",1667774623,1667776034,False,2,0,0.492957770824432373,0,True,False,False
740130,125068296,76561199221921158,0,6,114,0,64,1700876770,"*TL;DR: This was my first Tales series game, and it really surprised me. From my own personal enjoyment, I’d give it a 10/10. If I’m being more objective and taking my personal experience out of it, I’d still give it 9.5/10. In my opinion it’s the must play JRPG of 2021, as well as a great entry for JRPG newcomers, and those who are new to the Tales series. There were many good JRPG’s this year, but this was the one I enjoyed the most. Tales of Arise is worth the $60 price tag, and if you can find it for less than that, grab it. I'd suggest waiting for a publisher sale, as you can find this game and it's DLC for 50% off. I already wish I could play it again for the first time. Enjoy


I got the Platinum Trophy for this game on PS5. So my in game hours don't reflect my play time with this game, but it took me around 72 hours to get 100% completion. I bought this sale just to be able to play it on Steam Deck. And so far, so good, it runs great on the Steam Deck.

This was my first Tales game, and it really surprised me. The combat is really fun, smooth/fluid, and it has gorgeous animations; the graphics are good, and the story is worthwhile, even if there are some cliche moments and overused plot devices like amnesia. There’s also a lot of character development with all of the party members, and I found the party members to be plenty likable. I also really enjoyed the theme of romance between the party members, which is something I’ve yet to experience before Arise. Each party member has their own love interest, not just the protagonist. But the development between Shionne and Alphen was great, I couldn’t help but root for them. It’s a very polished and fun experience, and I can honestly say that Tales of Arise is my game of the year. I haven’t enjoyed a game as much as I did with Tales of Arise in a very long time, probably since playing the original Persona 5. Some of the themes are actually somewhat similar too, and it reminded me a lot of Persona 5 in the best ways.  Normally I couldn’t care less about getting a platinum, but this game was just that much fun. I’d also consider Tales of Arise to be newcomer friendly too, even if you’ve never played a JRPG.

Expect to drop anywhere from 50-100+ hours depending on whether or not you’re a completionist; whether or not you bought the double XP boosting artifact, and whether or not you actively searched for more XP boosting artifacts during your playthrough. These do however carry over in New Game Plus, so it’s definitely worth the effort. You could also buy level skips and jump up 30+ levels in no time, which would drastically shorten your play time. There’s many ways to go about it, just do what feels right for you. If you’re short on time, you at least have the option to skip all the grinding in favor of enjoying the story. I opted to buy the double XP boost Artifact that was like $3, and it was worth every penny... I'd even go as far to say it's necessary. I opted to skip the level jumps though, it seemed like it would take away the fun & the challenge. They’re also expensive, and they don’t go on sale like all the other Tales or Arise DLC.

My only criticism would be that the pacing in the second half of the game feels a little off, and there’s an info dump at around the halfway point signaling the second half of the game that can feel a bit overwhelming. It can also be quite a grind, more so than most JRPG’s. If you don’t want to spend hours and hours grinding, I’d suggest spending the $2-$3 for the double XP artifact, and actively search for artifacts while playing for further XP boosts. Another criticism I have is that some of what’s considered DLC feels like it should’ve been included in the base game; such as the paid double XP boosters.

This game has a lot of dialogue, so if that’s something you don’t want, steer clear of JRPG’s, not just Tales of Arise. But it does have great English voice acting. The game isn’t perfect, but with how fun it is, and with all the quality of life, and ease of use that’s built into the game, this is an overwhelmingly great game. There’s also a ton of after story activities when you finally finish, and I’d say it has a high replay value. It already has a New Game+ available for future replays.

Story is a joke. ""Slavery bad, friendship is magic"" stretched over 60000 hours. The game never ends. There are no interesting twists. Nothing of significance happens, ever.

Characters are gigasimps, forgiving mass murderers and villans only to get backstabbed, repeat 1000 times.

Combat gets REALLY spongey at the end. Your damage does not scale properly and fights take forever. It is not difficult nor engaging, just really drawn out. If this bothers you, feel free to buy additional levels and boosts conveniently offered in the store.

""A casualised version of what could've been a Tales of Game""

First, the obvious. It has improved graphics and animations.
Now. They removed most of the systems that Tales of games usually have. Systems that define the franchise.

They removed most of the elements and attributes and systems from combat, and now enemies are hp-sponges. Seriously, you can fight a common enemy of the same level as you, having the best equipment of that point in the story and it will take you multiple minutes to kill it. This is bull**it, they are extending the duration by extending the combats.

Story is good, not great, but good. Characters are also good, not great, but good.

Skits are worse in this game than in previous games. Skits are no longer 2D animated, they are now in 3D. This is not a bad thing per se, but the facial animations and lip sincronization are not good, which ends up these skits looking crappy and cheap (and overwall WAY WORSE than 2D animated skits from Zestiria or Berseria).

Weapon system is also worse than in Zestiria and Berseria. Now you don't have any kind of progression towars the utilization of a weapon, they no longer have ""levels"" nor ""affinity"", and since they don't provide status bonuses or elemental effects, you will just use the weapon with the bigger damage number each time.

The Cooking system is also worse than in Zestiria and Berseria. They also removed the progression system from which you could benefit creating better dishes as you leveled this ability up. Now you will just craft the best dish each time and you won't care about the other 99% percent of them.

They also reduced (a lot) the variety of enemies compared to Zestiria and Berseria. Many enemies look like the same enemy but with a different skin. It feels lazy and cheap. And they also removed the enemies drop progression system in which the more times you have defeated a certain enemy, the more chances of getting a better drop from that enemy you had.

Secondary missions are ""Errand boy"" missions. ""Go and kill X enemies"", ""Go and Gather X plants"", etc etc. They are boring, empty, repetitive and story-less.

They butchered the ""Mystic Artes"" system. Now in order to  perform a Mystic Arte you need to do perfect evades (which is hard by itself), but it is even harder if the enemy decides not to attack you for a while (then you loose the ""charges""), or if your companions attack the enemy too much so that he cannot attack you.

This is something thagt could have been a Tales of game, but that it is not. Casualization and laziness killed it.",1666466336,1667441216,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed the game until I was about 75% of the way through. Combat was fun, there was a good balance of exploration, story, side quests, combat etc. Then you hit the late game, and you get funnelled into just, grind, whether its story grind or combat grind. You either do nothing but talk for an hour or more, or nothing but fight for 3 hours, until you get literally teleported into the exposition dimension to carry you into the end. I don't understand why they made that choice, but it makes the last acts of the game very frustrating and tedious. If I could make a suggestion, it would be to ignore 95% of the RB1 prompt conversations. They add nothing, it's just the characters reiterating the important bits of the last cutscenes, and the end drags enough without them. And that's not to mention the Kai Leng-esque villain that hounds you throughout most of the end game.

The visuals are great, the combat is great, the voice acting is good, the game just has the most aggressive pacing issues of any game I've ever played.

[b][u]tl;dr just play Berseria instead[/u][/b]

[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]: The story starts out great and very engaging, but it didn't take very long after the party was fully formed for me to lose interest in the story merely out of... simplicity. The flow of plot becomes very predictable, and the end was rushed. The final dungeon didn't even feel like a dungeon, so they must've rushed some bits.

[b][u]CHARACTERS[/u][/b]: Like a lot of Tales games, characters start out fairly simply molded, and they develop as the plot progresses. Unfortunately, due to the shallowness of Arise's plot, our characters had little room for growth. My favorite character is Dohalim.

[b][u]LOCALES[/u][/b]: You cannot convince me that the whole game is set in [spoiler]a whole planet, a super-satellite the size of a moon, and a destroyed planet with an exposed core[/spoiler]. Each of the 5 countries in Dahna are little more than city-states with some countryside, yet together they're supposed to make up the entire planet. The scope of the story was too big for the setting they chose and the gameplay they put together. If there's one good thing about the small size, it didn't feel very empty. However, they should've come up with something a little different than the whole Dahna/Rena thing to make the setting feel a little more realistic to the gameplay. For reference, Berseria was a bigger game in the realm of sheer map size, yet the setting of that game was a single continent.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY pt.1[/u][/b]: Berseria have its 20 arte slots, but you could in fact use every single one of your artes far beyond 20 slots due to warrior's ventite (comboing by holding a button) and wizard's ventite (basically lets you start with a basic spell, but recasting instead of unleashing allows you to instead unleash a different, stronger spell with the benefit of shorter overall recast time compared to if you tried to cast that stronger spell from start to finish). Casting additionally had an ""exploit"" where dodging counted as a combo sequence, so dodging a few times before casting spells allowed you to cast with even shorter cast times (higher combo count shortens cast time). Due to having access to every single arte, the game had to be balanced where every single one of them was useful, and the gameplay often required you to use every single one of them (at least those that matched an enemy weakness or at least avoided their resistances). Berseria's Break Souls also automatically triggered a self-heal on the controlled character and allowed you to continue your combo which would've otherwise been strictly finite without using Break Soul. Remember how Alphen loses his HP from using his own abilities? Velvet also suffered a similar problem, but with key differences: using a Break Soul healed her, her HP drains as a function of time, she is invincible while her Break Soul is active (she can take damage but cannot die; upon hitting 1 HP, she will automatically unleash a finisher and leave Break Soul and lose her invincibility), and since a Break Soul costs a full Soul and there are finite Souls to carry, she must continue to stun and debuff enemies in order to refill her Soul count. If done right, Velvet is actually unkillable while being able to put out full offense. In addition to self-healing, using a Break Soul adds a STACKABLE damage boost to all your basic and mystic artes as long as you don't lose your combo, and with the right equipment giving an ungodly damage multiplier on stunned enemies, using a Mystic Arte on a stunned enemy after a very long combo chain with many Break Souls will do... more damage than you can hope to comprehend. Berseria's combat system is chaotic but beautiful. Wizard's ventite is unfortunately a little buggy, but all other gripes are minor. However, because Break Souls are so strong, playing at the highest difficulties usually results in getting one-shotted to game over, so don't take damage!

[b][u]GAMEPLAY pt.2[/u][/b]: The open world gameplay of Arise is mostly fine, and it makes sense to revert to teleporting to a combat arena as opposed to Berseria's doctrine of spawning a combat arena centered around where you encountered the enemy. This is because Arise has a much bigger variety of terrain, including MANY corridors and tight hallways. However, once in combat, you're faced with the most boring (and a very unbalanced) Tales combat system ever. The main new gimmick, finishing off enemies with the D-PAD (sound familiar, Vesperia players?) only triggers when the game feels like letting you fill that gauge, and on bosses, you will ALWAYS use it at 50% hp to deal... exactly 0 damage. It doesn't matter what damage number flies out of the boss's body, their HP gauge remains exactly the same as before tanking that boost strike. And of course you must use a boost strike at the boss's 1HP mark because they cannot die by any other means, INCLUDING MYSTIC ARTES. Additionally, the characters' usefulness and arte usefulness are extremely unbalanced. I ended up playing as Shionne or Dohalim 95% of the time. Never use Alphen as a party member because his special move sacrifices HP... however, when he's a support member, he can still use his special move at 1HP without dying and cannot receive damage from enemies while in support. And unlike Berseria, not only do you lose a SIGNIFICANT number of arte slots (Arise has just 12!? and only 6 of them are ground artes, and all spells are ground artes), but the artes available are very unbalanced with each other. Any that have long animations are automatically no-gos as during the attack animation, you cannot use the evade mechanic. Only Rinwell may use Magic Charging (this game's version of wizard's ventite with some changes), and using it usually seems to negatively affect your DPS. The only thing I liked about Arise's combat is how smooth evading and counter-attacking felt, even though the actual damage of the counter-attacking is usually pathetic. However, evading did feel too forgiving to use, and so to compensate, some bosses attacked near constantly. Unfortuately, even enemy Mystic Artes (with the exception of one) can ALL be avoided because you're still controlling your character and able to evade/counter-attack.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY pt.3[/u][/b]: Arise peaked at the second boss, [spoiler]Ganabelt[/spoiler]. If you fought him at a low enough level (which I did), his DPS checks were very strict, and you had to use all you knew of DPS-ing at the low level you were at. His DPS check that includes adds can actually be approached differently: you can attempt to kill 2 or more adds for the best mitigation against his Mystic Arte ([spoiler]Indignation[/spoiler], the only enemy one in the game whose damage cannot be avoided), or if you doubt you can kill 2 adds, just kill 1 and focus on healing/mitigation as you brace for impact. His normal attacks were telegraphed but fast, frequent but not constant, and it was very engaging to play (unless you controlled Rinwell, then you just didn't cast any magic).

[b][u]USER INTERFACE[/u][/b]: It was nice, but Berseria's had less animation, and less animation = faster navigation.

[b][u]PROGRESSION[/u][/b]: I don't know why some people were complaining pacing. I 100%'d the game in just over 90 hours (most of it offline so Steam's reporting logged hours are off), and if xp felt slow, it was definitely because I was overleveled for that area and it was time to move on to the boss. That said, I also felt more engaged in Berseria's story, characters, and environment, so my first completion took me about 125 hours, and I see that as a win because I liked the side content so much.

Bad: Special arts can become annoying at times as they interrupt the gameplay flow late game, the first two bosses are by FAR the hardest ones in the game. The following ones after are a lot easier.

Pretty big recommend for the battle system, kind of a toss up for the story, but the dialogue kind of hurts it (not to be confused with voice acting, which is good given the dialogue they have). I played through on hard mode where the enemies are absurdly spongey, but I still enjoyed the fights.

Characters even if slightly tropey are likeable and makes you feel invested in their relationships and interactions, and are probably the biggest draw of this game.

- Combat while looking good unfortunately has a few issues. Once you figure out the win button (hint: this character's HP bar is really a mana bar), the majority of ""difficult"" encounters are easily steamrolled using one strategy. The other problem is that boss enemies are so spongy that the aforementioned strategy is the best one to deal with them by a huge margin. It's unfortunate because it makes half of the characters' kits feel largely irrelevant.

- Graphics are very nice for JRPG standards, particle effects and animations look gorgeous.

- Music is nice, no ""Fighting of the Spirit"" though.

The game is challenging in a good way, where you need to learn each character moveset. 

Lets compare the game lets say to Kingdom hearts? So similar to Kingdom Hearts you are controlling 1 character and another AI will control up to 3 other characters during battle. Except this time, you can change to either Goofy or Donald rather than sticking to Sora. However, you will still be able to finish the game only playing 1 character(for example sticking to Sora exclusively). But micomanaging in between fights by taking control other characters definitely makes the game smoother and fights easier.

The difficulty has been ramped up severely, mainly in the form of limits to healing and obscenely expensive consumables, motivated by getting people to purchase ""cheat"" microtransactions. If you get this game, you may want to get a cheat program as well.

Long version:
Well this is awkward. My original review seems to have gotten noticed, which is sad because it was an unhinged rant. I was angry due to what they did to one of my favorite franchises, even though I saw it coming given what Namco did to Tales of Phantasia on mobile. I can do better, so here's a more thorough review.

I don't even know how to give ratings for certain categories under these circumstances, so some scores will be followed by [GS: X/10]. This means the reduced score due to Namco's greed.

Gameplay: 9/10 [GS: 5/10]
Tales games have always had great gameplay, and this one is no exception. It's the original beat-em-up RPG series and this entry adds a couple new forms of attacks to the mix. Mystic artes are easier to execute than in many other titles, jumping on the overworld is nice but underused. The Sorcerer's Ring is gone, replaced by context actions for getting past barriers. Combat in Tales games have never been completely fluid like with full-on ARPGs, but it's deliberate and careful planning will see you to victory.

That said, it gets a greed score of 5 due to the inherent, psychologically manipulative design. I've played at least 10 games in this series by now, but I've never been that great. Always managed to get by and in some titles (i.e. Zestiria) even excel with honest play. Usually end up using healing as a crutch.

You can't do that in this game.

The major change to healing in this game is any ability that heals drains from a pool called Cure Points. On its face, it seems great: Shionne isn't solely a heal bot when I play like her counterparts in previous titles would be. Unfortunately, healing has become extremely expensive. This pool is also shared with those context actions which makes things worse. The AI drains a lot of healing just with their own mistakes. Healing items have been weakened because they are no longer a % of health. Items that restore CP (Orange Gel, Pineapple Gel) are ludicrously expensive. (3000/9000 gald!) Getting gald isn't as straightforward as it is in other games, either.

It gets worse: If you aren't saving regularly and you fail a battle, you'll be spit out with any of these pricey consumables you used during said battle lost forever. Don't trust the autosave -- anything that looks like it could kill you, save save save. To be fair, it restores CP when you're spat back out, but you may need more than that for fights you'd need to save for.

On top of all this, the [b]the main character's advanced abilities all harm him[/b]. So even if you're not a terrible player like I am, you're not immune from this predatory system. This isn't like Violet who both harms and heals herself. You want to use the MC's abilities, you're paying a fortune in gald, which can be re-upped for ""only"" two bucks!

Controls: 10/10
They nailed it with Zestiria and two entries later, they still got it right. The keyboard/mouse controls are as strong as ever. It doesn't get overwhelming and everything you need to do can be done intuitively.

Story: 10/10
Tales games are best when the story is weird, and boy is this one weird. In the game's first region, I was shocked just how much was put out there -- it almost seemed like we'd have another Symphonia but without the twist. It's not, and it just gets weirder and weirder. This is easily a series top 5, and could be a top 3...but I'll need a couple years distance before I could say that.

The cast is also excellent, as it is tight-knit while still having as much interaction through main story and skits as a cast of 8 might have. The cast also skews mature versus most of the games, mascot included, which means none of them are particularly annoying. The only downside is none of them are particular standouts either, like Magilou was in Berseria.

Sound: 10/10
Motoi Sakuraba hasn't slowed down, giving us another great soundtrack that punctuates every story beat. The Japanese voices are also strong. It's an old series, they've long since figured it out.

Graphics: 10/10
I don't need much to please me -- I play lots of indie games. This title marks a massive leap in terms of graphical fidelity. The maps feel more real than real at this point, and I wasn't sure where the game was going to end because there are so many detailed maps. There is repetition, but the creators got good at hiding it.

Overall: 9/10 [GS: 6/10]
This is gaming in 2022 -- where we have to rate games for what they could have been if tuning were a little different. The game was designed from the ground up to push predatory microtransactions, and yet all of the strengths of the series are still there. This is painful to watch, a 25th anniversary marred by greed. A beloved series, so story rich that it's akin to a 26-episode anime season, pioneering gameplay, genius composer, reduced to this for a quick sleazy buck. I still encourage everyone to cheat: You paid for a full game, not a quarter muncher.

Namco can't undo what they did here. They can only make right in the next installment, or I'm out, and I don't think I'll be alone.",1665862359,1666539790,False,35,4,0.639273643493652344,0,True,False,False

An example of this is when characters are constantly respond with ""Oh, its nothing"" to everything when someone asks if they are okay, or if they they ask what are they thinking about. It gets annoying after 34 hours, dragging it out instead of dropping little hints every now and then. To me, this is a 7/10 game, but if you can handle the dragged out story, its a 8/10.

Good:
-The combat system is great. Able to chain lots of combos feels so good. 
-Finally character titles have more importance to it
-Kisara best mom, I don't care what others say, I will main her. 
-Beautiful scenery
-Romance is here. 
-Can swim 


Bad:
-Antagonist is just. Evil. Not more than that. They don't even have a proper build up for the villains. 
-Alphen is too much of a boring MC that his able to make other characters feel more interesting than him. 
-Plot is not that great at all
-Alphen is a simp through and through
-No 2D cut-ins for skits and Mystic Artes
-No intricate dungeon puzzles

New: After taking some little more time into the game. It's just the gameplay that is good but the story doesn't appeal to me at all, causing me to start losing interest on playing. Too little comedic moments, victory quotes are in text form are annoying since I prefer seeing than reading it.

+ Graphics look amazing, up to today's standards.
+ Loads of side-content.
+ Most dialogues are voiced. Conversations occur after accepting or completing quests.
+ Amazing voice acting.
+ Great performance optimization. Game ran totally fine on my PC.
+ Satisfying combos and flashy super attacks.
+ Lots of fast travel points.
+ Every character has a unique playstyle and trait.
+ Song choice.

[h2] Neutral [/h2]
= The story has good flow and pacing, but it is dragged too long by adding twists.
= Crafting accessories gets more complex as the game goes. Some may like its complexity, some may not.
= The Strategy feature helps tell AIs what to do given certain scenarios (e.g. heal at 50% HP), but it could be better.
= With no guard [spoiler] (except for Kisara) [/spoiler] and only evade, players need to practice timing evades to be rewarded with extra damage, which can be tough for casuals.

[h2] Bad [/h2]
- Combat is combo heavy, requiring the player to utilize each ability to its full potential.
- The flashy super attacks can get repetitive and boring as you progress the game.
- Monsters throughout the game can wipe your team in a few hits even within level range.
- Quests do not mention the level of a monster, sending you to your doom when you realize the monster's 20-30 levels above your team's.

At first I thought the starting tone of the game was great; serious, no jokes or gags. But as it continues, you start to noticed the terrible character development outside of the main MC and Herorine. Character decisions don't make sense, the writing fails to provide proper foreshadowing and it leaves you asking 'why' at every progression point. The gameplay feels great but the progress seems purposefully flawed. So flawed they had to make free DLC to include new diffculty modes. Story mode (this games based 'easy mode'), which the purpose of this mode is if you just want to play the main story will still require a heavy amount of grinding. The devs solved this with 'very easy' mode but then made it too easy. I personally never found my happy medium and can only assume they were banking on selling micro transactions as progressing through the game normally (doing main quests and some side quests) will not be enough for steady progression.

So I've got a lot of mixed feelings about this game, especially being a huge fan of the series.. I was expecting a lot after waiting so long for another mothership title to be released, but to be honest this game just doesn't live up to the hype.
I'll just quickly go over a list of Pros and Cons:
PROS: 
 - The combat is super fluid, very beautiful, very pleasing to watch. They specifically wanted to focus on that in this game this time around, and it definitely did pay off as the animations and the fighting are very fun and beautiful.
 - The story is actually very good as well, I've seen people knock the story a bit, but this was a good change of pace for the Tales series, previous games usually leave a lot of unanswered questions and loose ends, but in this game they went ahead and finished the game and explained everything, and didn't leave any ambiguity in this game. 
 - GREAT job on the crafting system, the weapon crafting was perfect and very similar to previous titles like Graces F, and was a huge addition for me.
Now that about wraps up my Pros so on to cons.
CONS:
 - No multiplayer... sorry but this had to be said. The Tales series has always PRIDED themselves on being a co-op game, with every single mothership title having multiplayer/co-op... and then nothing with this game (thankfully people have made mods for it.)
 - Lack of arte mixup.. What I mean by this is even though the combat is super fluid, you're very limited to the amount of artes you can use. In example, you can't equip low level artes, and high level artes, specifically the mages of the group, without sacrificing slots that you need for buff artes/healing artes. Tales of Vesperia allowed you to have 16 different Artes. Graces F had a unique A-arte table consisting of 16 artes + a B-arte table where you could choose which artes to have. No reason that they can't incorporate more artes for long-term fans who love to do massive combos.
 - End game content is non-existent. I hate to say this but the side-quests are extremely quick and lacking, and the EX-dungeons, while fun at first, have 0 merit afterwards. It took me under 10-20 hours to complete everything after the main quest. 
 - While this game has a great story, the story is heavily focused on the two main characters.. and the supporting characters really don't get as much love as they should have, like Kisara/Dohalim. 
 - Lack of variety on how to obtain some things.. in example, everyone gets their Level 2 Mystic Arte the same exact way (won't spoil how to get it though).

And that about wraps it up. I will say despite the negative review, I did enjoy playing this game a lot, however once getting to the end of the game it just lost all it's glory, I finished the main quest, and all previous Tales games have additions to the end game to make it more fun, like EX dungeons, the colosseum, comboing, grinding to max level (if you play Tales of Arise fully you will realize it's not hard to get max level, I got from level 50-100 in under an hour through a certain method thats easy.) MULTIPLAYER.. like cmon Bamco, this was the staple of this series..
A couple of things they did include from previous games that were wonderful to have:
- Cooking, nice to have it, but it was super lackluster in this game.
- While I think the colosseum is a great addition, they literally copy pasted all the fights for each individual character challenge, and also the group challenges.
- Skits. Been in almost every Tales game, and it was nice having them, people said they were clunky but I loved the skits in this game, previous games have it like a comic strip, in this game they felt interactive and like a nice side story. 
- Costumes.. sucked unfortunately. Old games have a huge variety of unique costumes (like Vesperia). 
- Hot springs. Been in every game, always nice to have. 
- Tribute to past Tales games. I won't spoil anything here, if you play the game fully you'll see what I mean. 

And that about summarizes everything for me here. If you read this fully, I appreciate it, as someone who has been playing this series for essentially 15+ years, and has played all titles, I really hoped for more from this game. I wish they kept the core aspects of the previous games, while building on this great and beautiful game but.. they really strayed away from the ""core"" of the series, and focused entirely on the ""looks"" of everything. If you want a visually pleasing game, this is a great choice, with fun combat. All I can say is if you want the real ""Tales"" experience, do yourself a favor and play Tales of Vesperia, Symphonia, Graces F, or if you like oldschool, play the PS1 remake of Tales of Phantasia. You will be blown away by the amount of content those games had, and why they still hold up well 10-25 years later.",1666328933,1666329238,False,0,0,0.498046845197677612,1,True,False,False

Pros
[list]
[*] story, characterization, world-building
[*] combat - it starts quite simple, but gets a lot more complex and flashy
[*] voice acting (jp)
[*] graphics (combat animations and effects are wonderful) and aesthetics
[*] pretty good music
[*] nice side activities - I recommend doing fishing from the start (there is a few voiced skits and it can help with money and food buffs). Subquests are also a good source of money and titles (which may unlock skills).
[*] 100% achievements isn't too grindy compared to other RPGs I played (e.g. SAO:HR)

Tales of Arise commits some egregious dlc no-nos and has gotten far too little flak for it.

First of all, locking character abilities at all behind launch day dlc is some hot dogshit, but the fact that there is stuff as impactful as a characters only aoe heal is fucked up. This is huge and the worst dlc I've personally seen in a JRPG.

Also this game has some of the strangest balancing... enemies are complete damage sponges, cash is very tight playing 'normally' without excessive grinding, and your levels are always lower and by a non-insignificant amount than the enemy's. These are issues I've never had in the history of the franchise. And what a surprise, you can just hop over to the DLC store to fix all these issues by purchasing money and xp boosts.

And to top it all off, they put the DLC menu right in the camp and on your main menu and constantly find ways to give you the red ""attention!"" Signal on the UI for the store so it's constantly reminding you of it's presence.

Honestly it's the worst DLC practices I've seen in the subgenre myself and I'm shocked only one reviewer seemed to mention it at all.

The game is fantastic besides these issues imo, but I'd really recommend people avoid the game for these reasons. I've heard a lot of people excusing the practices as well - oh it's fine you're under leveled, farming dogtags gets you cash if you know what your doing, just use Shionne to heal, Tales have had xp/gald dlc before.....

But the plain truth is this stepped way over a line. Never have I felt the need to penny pinch or grind levels in this series until Arise, which could just be attributed to a change in design, but when taking in the whole picture of the DLC it's hard to excuse it. Predatory dlc that's clearly effected the games design to extract money from players via low effort DLC. Straight up shameful, and really mars what would have otherwise been my favorite entry in years.",1666011339,1666011339,False,387,6,0.892956733703613281,0,True,False,False

This game, however, has put me back onto the Tales games in a big way. The story is so in-depth, and narrative drops you right in the thick of it.

As of the time I write this review, I have not finished the game yet, so maybe it'll get worse and I'll hate it later, but I can't really see that happening. I am enthralled.

Edit: So now that I have completed the game, I feel my recommendation to purchase this game goes a long way.

I loved everything about this game. It felt modern, yet, nostalgic all at once. It had all the elements I loved from many of my favorite old school JRPGs, but with a modern feel. I enjoyed the animated cut scenes, voice acting was top notch (in both English and Japanese), (Edit: I played this in Japanese, after hearing more of the voice acting in English, I would say stick to Japanese) and the story elements were filled with all the creativity Japan has to offer (without any of it's overboard convoluted confusion they often do these days). When you play it in Enlgish, the voice track doesn't quite match the lip sync, but even that kind of reminded me of an old school RPG. It felt like I was playing Lunar 2, which for those of you that don't know, is a good thing. The only thing that stopped it from feeling like a full-on old school JRPG was the lack of a world map, which we rarely see these days anyway, so that's okay. 

I also love how certain armors will change your appearance, and how weapons change appearance as well. I've always been a sucker for that. The battle system is very fun, and I love how you gradually unlock skills and battle functions that make the system feel fresh well into the game. 

If I had to nitpick, I could say the only thing I found a bit overbearing were all the sub scenes the game gives you. So every few seconds, it seems, your party has something to say about an event, a place, or another character. Don't get me wrong, this feature is excellent. It's enjoyable in other games, like DQ11 and Star Ocean (if I remember correctly), but in this game there are so many scenes, I couldn't help but to feel inundated by them. Of course, they are completely optional and you can skip them, but I definitely wouldn't. Those scenes give the player lots of insights on the characters and the background of the world in general. A lot of them are genuinely humorous and heartfelt, and if I'm honest, they were fun. However, with the sheer number of scenes you're presented with, it feels like too much of a good thing--especially when you're in the middle of a dungeon trying to stop a baddie from doing something evil and have to stop 3 times in one room to hear it. Again though, these are completely optional, but if you're into JRPGs like I am, it's really not. Although I griped about these scenes a little, I love the animated manga style in which they're presented. I thought that was a nice touch.

All in all, I can't recommend this game enough. I kind of wish this was how the last Star Ocean game felt, but sadly, I don't think that series will come back strong any time soon..

Warning: you may encounter some errors here and there of my english.
And i’m not here to praise the game mainly because there are lots of flaws need to be discussed and the text limitation.

Tldr: The game has highly focused progression and linear gameplay than the past titles. The game did great at some certain aspects as you can see from my score but failed to deliver good role playing experience. it’s filled with bad executed anime tropes&cliches combined with repetitive bad dialogues unlike other JRPG, characters spouting nonsenses and lastly, the plot holes that keep breaking my immersion. 
But! do not hesitate buying it If you don't care about what good JRPG is or Immersion, if you're fine with immature anime-ish rpg, if you want to buy it solely because of combat or its' attractive art&design, that's fine, it's worth your money, but for me this is not a good jrpg of my taste because of some certain aspects that i couldn't let it pass. 

BTW Rinwell’s cuteness 10/10 

Hello, community’s choice of best RPG award, people keeps saying u are well polished, i think they are blinded by all of ur beautiful graphic, so i’m here to prove that they are wrong about you being a “polished game”.

-First, the game suffers from pacing issue, a fast pacing one, to the point that there is only little to no development outside the main casts. Death and lost aren't impactful because player barely spend time knowing that character, everything goes pretty fast and it made every emotional scenes pretty dull.

-Introduction to each lords is not impactful, the game feels rush, in each region, you just couldn’t spend enough time in each city to feel attract to people there, words and story telling and how&when you meet each lord is not good enough to leave the impact. You walk into a city and pass through it like a wind. Past Tales of games are better at introducing villains&minor characters. Cities also are just there as a bare hollow vessel for events to occur, they barely leave any impacts or impressions behind.
    To make it fair, let's just compare Artorius from berseria to every Lords in Arise, Artorius indeed a winner for doing better job as a villain, those very first Lords in Arise are even forgettable because we barely know anything about them, all we know is, they killed peopleee! bland and flat.

-Characters development sucks because the story feels so rush in each chapter,
Fine if you like something short and compact but this doesn’t grow on me. Another problem lies on the Skits itself, Skits, a bunch of short interactions between characters, when some of it get triggered at some point of the story, sometimes it didn't make any sense to the story or situation. Cause an inconsistency in character development. And they repeat themselves.

-For the story&setting is kinda meh to me but i still give it 7
    The game uses the common formula of an amnesia protagonist goes fight villians to save the world with his no life friends, i still missing games where your friends have their own life to take care and their own path to part away from you, then happen to meet and fight along again, but my experience with tales of series never be like that(ves, zes, ber and arise) your friends are always a bunch of no life following you around. But do i hate it? 
    No, Ys games that i love is kinda like that too but what make Ys is more interesting is Ys’ characters still have a bit of their own moment that may part away from you for a while and their own goals are more distinct from the main character. 
Apart from that, all minor characters are memorable, have good development and important role unlike Tales of series. In Ys most of the time the character you happen to like, might not be the one in your fighting party members, because of how well developed the supporting characters are.
    My experience in Ys is the only reason of why i don’t give Arise the low score. Despite my expectation, the story is very anime-ish, it goes fast like how you watch anime, you are not supposed to take your time taking bunch of details in a scene, and you get nothing worthwhile for doing that. Like the game telling you “just go to the next scene already, so you will get another cinematic movie that will keep your dopamine level high!” all the time, and i considered that the game respect your time, your general consumer’s time(which is not me lol) that’s why i give it 7 out of 10, it’s not a bad thing just need some adjustment and rewriting to eliminate the plot holes(which i will soon talk about).

-Excuse me for just one small nitpicking but the game has only one stop running animation. Not the dynamic one like other modern games, in this game, your characters' hands can teleport.

-Plot holes or things that make no sense to me
Most interactions are fun, but some few moments ruined the game
(like :(spoiler: Mahag Saar region) [spoiler]the scene that law gets in the way of Rinwell trying to get her revenge, Law keeps spouting all the cringe idealistic bull*** with his back facing a dangerous enemy who has just killed many civilians. The game try to convince that it’s necessary for development but isn't what they should do at that time is try to fight and capture her together? it's not like Rinwell's magic will instantly kill the Lord, so they can leave that drama talk after they down the lord, and that would be more convincing[/spoiler]
(And :(spoiler: Ganath Haros region) [spoiler]map Aureum Falls, after the skit ends Alphen says up again that they have to hurry and help shionne, she’s waiting for us!(repeating same info) then when you enter the interior you will have to face with a group of monster, after finish, Alphen will speak up like “aw that was hurt” “Shionne, heal me” “Ah that’s right, i forgot…” srsly! this writor doesn't know how to use EXPOSITION right, you don't need to tell this info to player over and over, otherwise it's just feel cringe[/spoiler]

(Minor spoiler about map layout of first region)
Click to see the summary pic that i made first-> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2678688207
 [spoiler]Location for ulzebek, and the way you flee from Renans soldier doesn’t make sense
I mean how tf Ulzebek able to exist for so long as a main base for the resistance? It’s right under the Lord’s castle ground, It’s also the worst location for main base and it’s not so far away from ‘Mosgul’
Right, Mosgul, it’s so freaking close to Ulzebek, now readers do you realize it? You fled all the way from Mosgul, the starting point just to end up right next to it. Oh and what a happy coincidence that there is an fcukin ELEVATOR that leads to the castle front gate! OH WOW BEST RPG yay[/spoiler]

-(Spoiler, Menancia) 
[spoiler]one npc tell story about her boyfriend is being sick, and has to go to medical facility but still hasn’t come back…. because what the game told us in the story that there is no medical facility in quarry, any body who went there was turned into hollow, and became the part of the lake. BUT if that still happening, how tf no one realize that many Danans are gone. How tf no one question about it? And continue living peacefully. It’s one of the most stupid plot holes.[/spoiler]
Game tries to tell story, create a world through dialogues and environment but failed to make it a believable one. Nothing wrong with it because this is one of many series that will throw away all plots, worlds and characters then make a new game/story under same title. Ofc you will see less focus on world building.

It follows the adventures of Iron Mask a slave (allegedly) of the Denan who is harvesting people's astral energy for the Competitions of the Lords, the champion of which is the one who collects the most AE and thus becomes the ruler of the Motherland.

Of course, Iron Mask (if that is indeed his real name), decides he wants to stop it, and along with discovered colleagues along the way, you will go on to challenge the Lords with the aim of destroying them.

The game progresses quite quickly, but the story feels a bit strained in the writing with typical RPG tropes on clear display, and many one-way dungeons to travel though. Eventually though, you'll discover more Artes to use in combat and you'll even get to buy DLC costumes, which is awesome I guess.

Overall, this seems like one of the better Tales games, so definitely worth taking a look when the game is on sale. I give this one 7 It Sucks to Be the Chosen One out of 10.",1665917407,1665917407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is not bad, it just doesn't live up to the standards of other tales games. The game is good but not worth its price. It is worth it on sale.  it's certainly not worth $59.99,  I'd say wait for it to be on sale for about $19.99  

The Things that were bad:

I have one hundred percent completed the game, and I have found it to be lacking. For starters the story and dialogue and social commentary is meh at best and down right bad at worst. The game lacks content. I have over 700 hours in Tales of Symphonia and I have yet to one hundred percent it and found that story to be more captivating. The game is by far really beautiful, especially on the unreal engine, some of the fights were very cinematic and memorable however, the writing was so bad, one would think the writers were writing a children's story. 

  All the positive tales of Arise are undermined by the bad writing, The plot pacing and development feel like you are playing the shell of a game that has the potential to be phenomenal. 
      On another note, while they had a cooking system, it wasn't in detail as many tales veterans expect from a tales series. I thought it was a pretty unique mechanic to actually find the ingredients to cook. but there was little to no progression in their cooking skills, so there was very little incentive to cook other than for minor stat boosts and perks in combat. 


Things that were good: The Game, is very beautiful, especially with the unreal engine. I enjoyed the combat system it had its own unique flare while also paying homage to its predecessors. I found the mechanic of being able to deal massive damage at the cost of health to be engaging.  I also enjoyed the audio of this game, the subtle soundtracks I feel, really do capture an essence with subtle callbacks to other tales games.",1652903275,1665908244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every party member has massive, unique skill trees and the combat system is fantastic. Fluid, well balanced and fun as hell.

The story is fast, epic, and amazing (plus very applicable to our world today) with wonderful characters across the board, each with their own strengths and flaws. Watching things unfold at a quick pace keeps me interested, and the battle system has never been better and has me totally hooked! There are so many options for how you want to play, or just set things to ""auto"" and watch your team fight for themselves according to your pre-set instructions, while you go drink a beer.

I love, love, love the story and this game's take on heavy themes like systemic racism, classism and slavery to name a few. There are so many ""all too human"" moments, where characters deal with their feelings about complex issues, or reevaluate their ideas after new experiences change how they see the world.

But unfortunately, it feels like all these high production values are wasted on average writing. There were lots of moments that were supposed to be emotional, but they just weren't executed well. Not enough build-up, no context. Lots of scenes came out awkward rather than touching. As usual, the English voice acting is a disaster, so I ended up having to switch back to Japanese like I almost always do on JRPGs.

The final boss was great in one way and horrible in another - again, beautiful graphics and F/X, totally awesome for a final battle. But the story and writing are just... ugh. Tons of plot holes everywhere, stuff that just doesn't make sense but added in for cinematic effect. By the end of the game just have so many questions, and not thought-provoking ones, but more bewildered and accusatory (""what the hell was the point of X, Y plot point?"") and things like that.

In addition, the side quests in this game were lacking. The huge majority of them were just fighting more monsters. For at least the first half of the game you are severely lacking in money and are either forced to grind ridiculous hours or purchase DLC money.

Story and writing feel like a downgrade from Berseria, whose characters were written well, story was cohesive from start to finish, and although it also had plot holes, not nearly as big or as many. The game left me satisfied - this one... eh, lukewarm.

Play it for the fun hack 'n slash like combat and beautiful graphics, not an amazing story with amazing writing. About the only things that were written well were relationships between specific pairs of people.",1664595250,1664595250,True,1,0,0.505154609680175781,0,True,False,False

By the end of the first half, I could not give a fart about any of the characters and there was little hook to keep me going. Maybe I'm just old-school, but old Tales dungeons used to have puzzles or quirks to figure out for each one. That was removed here to make it more streamlined, but it resulted in the dungeons all feeling the same, just with different paint. You run around, look in rooms for treasure, and fight things. Same formula each time until combat became such a chore to get to the next part of the story that I turned on auto-battle. 

The characters felt bland to me with very little development where in past Tales games you went on a journey with them and experienced things with them and saw how they grew organically. 

Also, my God. The skits. Old Tales games I would look forward to skits. Little rare dialogue cutscenes where your characters talk to one another and reveal a little more about their character and backstory. In this game, you get sometimes LITERALLY (I counted) five skits in a row following already long cutscenes and they add very little to the story and characters because they discuss things they'd literally just discussed in a cutscene. They shoehorn in character interactions this way because there are very few opportunities for them to do so otherwise. 

This just didn't have the same charm as old Tales games. I couldn't finish it.

However, the combat is so atrociously bad I have to leave a negative review. While on the surface, I do quite enjoy 3rd person action combat, the implementation in Tales of Arise is possible the worst I've ever seen. My major issues are the following:

- There is no animation canceling. This is a fairly core element in my mind, and without it having a system for dodging and blocking attacks is fairly meaningless when you also have very long skill animations.

- No stagger protection/multi-hit protection. It's almost impossible to escape a multi-hit combo once you've been hit, again, this feels very bad.

- Little to no telegraphing. If you're meant to dodge/block/cancel major enemy attacks you need to be able to see them coming, which is often not the case for bosses and only gets worse the more party members are out on the field throwing particle effects at it.

- AI party members are dumb as rocks and kind of suck, but you can't go without them either. Once a boss fight has progressed far enough it often devolves into just spamming revival and healing items trying to keep them all alive.

Put all these together, and the experience of fighting anything more than a normal mob pack is frustrating and unfun, to the point I find myself dreading having to fight actual bosses which is a shame, because outside of that I've actually enjoyed my time with Tales of Arise.

Effectively, this game is trying to have ""souls like"" combat which is punishing but rewards player skill, without having any of the mechanics needed to achieve that.",1664051291,1664062692,False,7,0,0.562469959259033203,0,True,False,False

First off, the environments are unusually varied and simply gorgeous. Wherever we go, lots of attention was put on making sure each segment of the Twin worlds felt highly distinct yet highly detailed. This is true both for open large areas, and for cities. While the latter don't necessarily offer that much to do outside of resting, buying stuff and starting quests, they remain quite joyful to explore and impressive to look at. It's certainly a nice touch that the NPCs have different things to say depending on where we're at in terms of the main story. And then, the castles interiors, while admittedly often making more sense in terms of video game exploration than what they're supposed to be story-wise, are incredibly beautiful and intricate themselves. It's also quite remarkable how, regardless of the complexity of the visuals, the game never seems to perform badly. Not once did I notice any perceivable frame rate drop in-game. 

Some of the cut scenes are drawn and animated (very well too) in two 2D, anime style, which only amplify the overall mood of the experience. Which is to say that it does feel a bit like watching a shounen anime series, complete with the overpowered and more or less young looking protagonist, over-the-top abilities (including in play), and somewhat overly dramatic and one-dimensional characters (at least initially). About the latter, I must say I was annoyed at Alphen and his weird (at least they came out weird to me) and angry reactions at everything about the revolt, though to give credit where it is due, it looks like every single main character when through a significant, and overall interesting evolution. When it comes to the story, while I wouldn't call it revolutionary (in the end, it's still about saving the world as one would expect), it's definitely well-crafted and engaging, and goes quite deep both within its thematic boundaries and within the relations between characters. There are lots of cut scenes, and lots of dialogues (like in anime)! 

I guess the only aspect of the game, apart from some characters being initially a bit overly dramatic to my taste, that kind of struck me wrong was the sheer absurdity of thoughtlessly pairing the premise with some specific mechanics and dialogues. Like, for a story with characters that are so profoundly and actively bent on opposing slavery and any kind of ""exploitation"", it's kind of bizarre that they'd end up owning a ranch, killing whatever animal that reaches maturity, or that they would so often talk with passion about devouring various species on Dahna (multiple skits revolve around that), to the point where it's laughable, or perhaps uncomfortable (I mean if you care about the subject and its representation in fiction of course). Again, it's not something I'd bring out too often myself in such reviews, but in this case, it seemed uncommonly obvious, forced, and contradictory.

The music is amazing. It properly sets the mood in most situations and is actually neat to listen to by itself! What else is there to say about it?

Combat is also wildly pleasant. It has its various complexities, yet never to the point where I wouldn't know what I'm doing or felt compelled to spam one strategy at all times. The AI isn't too bad, although this does depend on settings you apply on your teammates in the menu. Evading and counter-attacking feels mostly fair and fun and ended up being central to my play-style, while it's something I'd often leave as an afterthought in many other similar games. Also, it's worth pointing out that if you get tired of playing the same character, you can eventually switch between six different characters with vastly different styles of play.

All in all, albeit very few faults here and there, I'd say this is one of those gems you don't see too often and don't necessarily expect to find. In fact, I wasn't too sure about the game for the very first few hours, but stick with it for a bit, and you might be in for quite a ride! In the end, this is probably one of my favorite JRPGs yet, right up there with the likes of FFXII and DQXI. Just awesome!
9/10

[b]As a side note![/b]
While I don't consider it central to the experience itself, the DLC practices demonstrated here are notably problematic. Let's be clear: it's never technically needed to buy more gald, more levels, exp enhancements or other similar stuff, but the game does seem to be built so that if, for any reason, you are struggling with those elements, you might feel the need to buy some of the DLCs (in particular, it is extremely hard to overlevel and farming gald is less direct that in many other RPGs). It's also a damn shame, because some of the ideas implemented, like limiting the number of any type of potion to 15 by default, are interesting in practice for anyone looking for the challenge it provides, but locking an alternative 99 capacity behind a paywall instead of just integrating it in a more elaborate difficulty setting seems like a missed opportunity at best, or at worst abusive. Nobody buys a fully-priced single player game expecting to pay more so that they can properly enjoy it, nor should they have to. I have otherwise nothing against the more cosmetic DLCs, for which the pleasurable benefits are very clear (and for which, you know, there is actual work involved on the developers side).
Anyway, for that reason alone, I'd say you ""might"" want to wait for a rebate. I personally bought the deluxe edition months ago for significantly less than what the regular edition is currently sold at, so I imagine patience might be worth it.",1663968475,1663968475,True,1,0,0.501953125,0,True,False,False

I've played previous Tales games such as Vesperia and Berseria and, while both of those were pretty repetitive in the combat, I didn't feel like it was the same slog I found myself in trying to get through this one. 

Early on I unlocked one move where I would do 10x the damage of every other move I unlocked. There was never a point to use other moves other than the game punishes you with diminishing returns on spamming the same move. Once you've done a few battles, it's the same for the next 50+ hours. Every enemy is like hitting a pinata with a damp cardboard sword. It's not hard, it's tedious, and in traditional anime fashion they have to announce every attack move they make so get ready to hear DOUBLE DEMON FANG 20 times per encounter. Even the hitboxes are goofy. And don't get me started on the final zone, where you will face waves of the same monsters over and over and over and over and over and over (not a spoiler). I'm usually one to try and do all the side missions and get the most out of a game, but after playing some of the most boring side missions I've ever encountered in my 30 years of gaming, I just wanted it to be over so I could justify my spending money on it and uninstall. Seeing that only 34% of people have finished the game, I would say it's pretty telling that 7/10 people gave up on it before I did. 

The world, while artistically creative, feels empty and dead. The few towns and cities you go to will have a few NPCs who don't even walk around. Everyone is just a static mannequin. There are cooking buffs, but they typically only last 5-15 minutes before you have to find another campfire to rest/cook again... no thanks. There was a weird tiny farm/stable minigame, but it felt slapped on last minute and was out of place, didn't even bother. There is a fishing minigame, which is better than some minigames I've played, but doesn't offer anything worth the time investment. There is almost 0 character customization outside of collecting goofy glasses or ears/tails to put on your characters from the various owls scattered across the zones. You will find a few armor upgrades, they don't change you appearance, only ""outfits"" do-- but there are only a few unique outfits you'll find without paying for DLC... no thanks.

TL;DR: Should have been an anime. If you're gonna buy, wait for a deep discount and play before bedtime because the boring/repetitive combat will help put you to sleep.",1663654750,1663711946,False,6,1,0.493957161903381348,0,True,False,False

The DLC is overpriced and should just be a part of the game, I bought the DLC that included outfits because it comes with in-game currency 'Gald' and ""talent points"" in addition to rounding out the game visually.  I did not buy the DLC that was +10 levels, +Gald, etc.

The game is composed of three Acts, Act I and Act II are pretty seamless and I could full clear dungeons, do all side quests, etc. and it felt conjoined.  Act III unlocks some side quests that are higher level requirement than what it takes to be the end game boss and there is no warning of this fact.  You may find yourself completedly out classed by a side quest despite full clearing all game, this content is intended for the 'Post-Game'.  

Play through the main story, once that's done, the 'Post-Game' side quests will make leveling a breeze and you'll find yourself going from lvl 59 (where I completed the game) to lvl 100 by the time you finish the post-game side quests.

The combat system was very innovation and a bit button mashy at times but I still want to give props for making a new combat system, kudos.

It's your typical Tales Of game, so for people familiar with the franchise, this will fit in with the rest of the series. Having said that, it is NOT the best game in the series (although it IS the best looking, by far). 

First of all, I just want to say that general game performance was flawless. I didn't have a single crash, and as far as I can remember, I don't think I even encountered a single glitch in my entire playthrough. The game just ran amazing.

Combat is really the meat of the game. Note that I played through the entirety of the game on Hard, so that might influence my opinions. At first glance, it's fun, smooth, plays great, and looks amazing. But as you get better at the game, I couldn't help but notice issues with the combat system.
 
First of all, there is an extreme over-reliance on countering the enemies ""types"". Charger dudes needs you to use the counter charger character, dodger dudes needs you to use the counter dodger dude, magic dudes needs you to use the counter magic character, and so on. If you don't block their mechanics, you WILL take a boat load of damage and way more time to deal with the combat. 

Next is ability balance. I realize that not every skill in a game should be as good as every other skill in the game, but the good skills are VERY good, and the bad skills are a total waste of your time. So much so that if you aren't constantly spamming the exact same attack over and over, your being very inefficient. Which is fine, but around halfway through the game, enemies really start turning into bullet sponges, so your sitting there spamming the same ability for forrrrever. When playing the mages, each time you cast a spell, the next spell in that combo has a -10% or -20% cast time. So you want to pick a spell and just keep comboing it until you run out of action points (you can get a 10s cast time spell down to maybe 1s doing this). 

Which leads me into my next complaint about combats. Each character has skills which trigger mini-cutscene attacks. These cutscene attacks occur in EVERY fight in the game, constantly. I'm talking every 30s or so. They're cool at first, but by the end of the game, I saw these skills literally thousands of times. And each time they occur, they interrupt and end your current combo and resets your characters and the enemies to the starting combat position, which ruins your spell chains I described above.

Regarding the story, I don't really have much to say here. The story was okay, but it didn't really stand out as amazing. The twist halfway thru the game seemed kind of unsurprising, and didn't really add anything to the story. Character development is always a great component of the franchise, and this game was no different in that regard. Most of the characters were great and I enjoyed what each of them brought to the table.

And finally, the main minigame, fishing, was incredibly boring and locking character skill development for one of the characters behind mandatory fishing is kind of a bullshit design design decision.",1663554051,1663554051,True,1,0,0.500565409660339355,0,True,False,False

-One of the most bland cast of characters in any RPG I've played. There are plenty of fun moments between your party members, but only because the game lasts long enough for them to eventually happen. On their own, they just aren't very interesting. Most characters that aren't in your party get basically no development and lack any reason to like them whatsoever.
-The final 15 - 20 hours of the story is one of the most SEVERE drops in quality I have ever witnessed in a game. The story was only decent to begin with, but the final act will test your patience.
-Lots of forgettable boss fights.
-Most of the good costumes are held hostage as paid DLC...in a single-player game. There are some decent accessories and recolors you can unlock in-game, but nothing compared to the quality of what's on the store.

Fundamentally, the game is beautiful, and I enjoyed putting wacky cosmetics on my characters that persisted through cutscenes.

However, it  came to the point when I realized just how much  excessive ""side dialogue"" that shows up. I think about 15-20 minutes alone was just listening to the protagonist and the supporting protagonist ping-pong back and forth with each other about, ""You're not so mean,"" ""What..!? What are you talking about, I was never mean"" ""Yeah, I just thought you were a little at first, but I can see now,"" ""*hmph* that's just how it felt to you"", etc on multiple different instances.

The combat has a great foundation and they built on it wonderfully. But in-place of steady pacing as you go through the game. They've replaced it with turning all fights into damage sponges, no matter how much you overlevel.  

The story so far, is pretty much Bandai Namco standard fare. Nothing horrific, and nothing stellar. Just down the middle and acceptable. 

Why did I vote it negative? Primarily, when it came to deciding to start each play session, it was more of a dread of starting it because of how much damage sponge I was going to have to slog through, while traversing it's unimaginatively designed environments. The castle arc that I just did (the second boss), had the most uninspiring interior design ever, that just did not seem sensible. There were so many random dead end hallways and staggered elevators, etc.

I may play it again when I am desperate, for the time being. It's no thanks. I don't understand why it was so ""acclaimed"",  unless standards have dropped.

This game is a love-hate relationship, and at this point i just want to finish it so i can move on with my life. The story gets to a certain point and takes a colossal nose dive. I've NEVER experienced such an overwhelming amount of excessive narrative and cut scenes in one game. At one point i sat through easily around 2 hours of stop start narrative/cutscenes which were over explained nonsense. It's like when you're at school, writing an essay and struggling to get to the word limit so you just start filling it with waffle to pad it out and extend the utter garbage you're almost certainly writing. It's awful scripting and for me, it truly cripples this game. There's a stupid amount of twists and turns in the story and it begins to be an ass pull - I'm fairly confident at one point I sighed out loud and rolled my eyes as I lay witness to yet another plot twist. A truly lazy attempt by the writers to keep the otherwise linear and boring story line somewhat entertaining. Unfortunately - they fail - miserably. 

What saves this game is the combat and fluidity of it. The monster design is brilliant but unfortunately even they begin to get boring as they're just re-skins of monsters you've fought literally 100's upon 100's of times. Boss encounters are great and i truly enjoyed putting my combat skills to the test against them. Squad building is fun, where making your team really compliment each other becomes truly rewarding. The skill and artes system is also really good and I enjoyed experimenting with what benefit my play style. Sadly the game is also an absolute grind without SP boosters, so good luck getting the 'chunky' skills without them.....

All in all, I'm not sure what pulls me back to this game. The graphics are a joy, and although the narrative is an absolute overkill dumpster fire; I have found myself liking and growing fond of almost all of the main party. (especially Hootle). 

I don't think I can recommend this game - so for now I'll give it a thumbs down depending on how the ending pans out. I'd only recommend this game if you love RPGs and you're up for a somewhat casual adventure, with great combat, team building and graphics. HOWEVER, be prepared for some of the most excessive narrative you've ever experienced in any video game and be ready for that to potentially kill your experience (it almost has mine), I'm not joking......it's THAT bad.

============
Okay, after a year I gave this another try and I could actually solve some of the original problems. The borderless window mode seems to have a very negative effect on the shaders. After switching to true fullscreen mode, most of the ugly artifacts in short to mid distance were suddenly gone and the game looked WAY better. The shader effects in long distance were still rather hit or miss though.

Anyway, I played until I beat Vholran and freed Pelegion - just to find out that the game isn't over and there's a part two. But while I got to like most of the characters (Dohalim not so much), the overall story still didn't really grab me and the fights were dragging more and more towards the end, despite playing on easy. So I decided to call it a day at that point, especially considering that comments about part 2 weren't exactly flattering.

I think for their next game, they should really offer more stuff to do in the world than just fighting and an actual seemless world or at least bigger world parts would be a massive improvement. The arena mode for the fights also felt severely outdated and the combat itself rather dull. The arts were also just guesswork with no helpful description whatsoever. Even Berseria was more transparent. Half of the time you're just triggering special attacks from team members anyway - that still barely do damage.

Overall, I'd rate this game up now to a middle thumbs. Steam doesn't support that, so I keep the thumbs down. It's better than I initially thought, but it still has way too many flaws. A part 2 shouldn't make me groan ""Oh no! This isn't the end yet?!"".

Original review:
============
So, I liked Tales of Berseria quite a bit even if it had its issues, so I had high expectations for this game. However, having played the game for a few hours now, I honestly don't like it at all. The story premise is over the top bland and generic, with the ultra evil Renans enslaving the poor Dahnans and the characters aren't much better.

I also really hate the muddy look of the game. This wasn't so obvious at first when watching shrinked down videos and screenshots, but experiencing it in game in full resolution made it so much more obvious. Everything looks like someone poured a bucket of dirty water over it. It looks really awful and I wish I could just switch off that ugly shader effect.
I'm fine with realistics art and anime/comic art, but this tries to be both at the same time and just fails at it. Just look at Genshin Impact for comparison - that's a clean and beautiful anime look. And here everything looks dirty and washed out. The characters look better since they were actually designed for an anime look, but the environment is just a bog standard realistic look with an ugly shader put on top of it. I've no idea how anyone could like that look.

Music is also pretty meh and the voice acting completely random. Some stuff is voiced some not. You can pretty much roll a dice on every dialog if it's voiced or not.

The combat system is a confusing mess that takes ages of simplistic button mashing to finish. Though, to be fair, Berseria wasn't really much better in that regard. The combat system was certainly not the reason I liked Berseria. Map navigation is also just as confusing with mostly no indication where you have to go.

Overall, a complete disappointment in almost every way.",1633473572,1662591722,False,3,3,0.399277091026306152,0,True,False,False

As far as Tales games go, the combat, systems, graphics, etc are all an obviously big improvement over previous in the series, however the story is where everything kinda falls flat.

I feel like a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but I don't find a story that revolves around the oppressed trying to sympathize with their oppressors particularly interesting. This narrative that violence inherently begets violence and it's on those who are oppressed to forgive and forget to produce change isn't really rooted in any reality and only serves to keep systems of power in place by removing tools from the disenfranchised (or at the very least gives the oppressors a bad justification for their violence). There's somewhat of an interesting, yet fleeting moment where Dohalim has to confront his guilt and learn how best to move forward with it which is almost redeeming, but it does little when characters like Rinwell are consistently set up to look bad for not ""getting over"" being hunted down her entire life by slave drivers and soldiers of a racist oppressive regime. It would've been a lot better to explore and give more empathy to those in that position, rather than posture them as the villains.

For idealistic games trying to create a better world, the Tales series has multiple that do a much better job at it. Especially when confronting ideas of privilege and redemption, Tales of the Abyss is a much better narrative. However that not being on PC, I would recommend Tales of Berseria as the next best thing for a narrative that is actually empathetic to the trauma of it's characters, while not condoning anything particularly harmful.

I do appreciate this series in general for trying to go above and beyond in creating narratives that reflect real people and situations scaled up to a fantasy setting, however this always comes at the risk of being out of touch, and unfortunately this one failed the task.",1662517932,1662517932,False,10,1,0.508229732513427734,0,True,False,False

The story is soulless and only exists because they needed an arbitrary number of main locations for you to trudge through (in this case 5). You might think, ""ok this is just the premise, there's going to be more to it than that"" but no, the story explained to you in the first 20 minutes is the first 30 hours of the game, no joke. Which would be fine if they went for a ""the journey, not the destination"" approach where each area was a fun little romp, but in fact for our heroes EVERYTHING is about the destination, everything they talk about and do serves this purpose, with no room for worldbuilding. Yet somehow there is NO exposition the first 4 locations, then the game just decides to go HAM at the end and finally explain the story, way past the point of anyone caring, not done in a remotely clever or caring way that implies any kind of build-up or motivation. And even when plot points occur, it's hard to know if the developers are just infodumping or legitimately want me to be in shock/amazement but I pretty much sat pokerfaced through 99% of the game waiting for something cool to happen.

The locations are soulless, the first two areas are just ""red land because fire"" and ""blue land because snow"" and the rest of the areas follow suit in being visually nice but aesthetically uninteresting; every castle or dungeon is just repeated corridors, and every town is DEAD. Every NPC says the exact same thing, going with whatever the theme is; for example in area 2 people are afraid of being snitched out to local authorities, so everyone says some variation of ""I sure hope nobody reports me!"" Completely monotone, lifeless dialogue. In fact I'm pretty sure this snitching business only exists for the writers to hit you over the head with some thematic masturbation. The Witcher 3 showed us how to make towns look alive 6 years beforehand; there's no excuse for this NES-tier dialogue.

The characters are soulless, particularly egregious for a JRPG and doubly so for Tales, a series that at least has eccentric characters if nothing else. Alphen has no personality. His go-to line is ""I will protect my friends!"" and a million variations, which is fine but WHO is Alphen? Nobody knows, he never talks about himself or exhibits any character traits whatsoever. As a result he has zero character growth throughout the game. Shionne is a tsundere and...no wait, that's it. Just a totally shameless textbook trope, goes from tsun to dere after random plot event and that's about it. Rinwell is a racist mage, you know how this goes, she's racist because she was wronged by members of said race years ago and held a grudge ever since, then she learns they're not ALL bad and we are the REAL monsters and oh my god these characters suck. The rest of the cast isn't even worth mentioning. Rather than entertain, intrigue, or develop over the course of the game, these characters are forced by the writers to discuss surface-level themes of the game's story like they're in a 9th grade English class. Shouldn't the story and dialogue speak for themselves? Why do characters need to constantly say ""hey, remember [x], doesn't that just prove that human nature is [y]? I guess I never really reflected on that."" Any character quirks only show up in skits and even those are lame. Shionne likes eating, haha so funny I guess. Usually ""bland"" goes hand-in-hand with ""inoffensive"", but here the characters are offensively, aggressively, and intolerably bland.

I would say the NPCs are soulless but the reality is there are no NPCs outside of townsfolk. I'm not even kidding, there's nobody. There's one or two early in the game, but as they fade away, it's the same 6 party members the rest of the game with zero non-villain characters of any interest. In the third area of the game, you have giant empty field, giant empty town, giant empty castle, giant empty forest, and giant empty quarry. In all of these areas, there is nothing, nobody to meet, nothing to do, just beeline straight to the castle so you can meet the two NPCs who will become your party members. There's one other NPC who is disposed of as quickly as he's introduced, but that's it. Every area is like this. I mean this game feels legitimately rushed, like they had all these locations created then didn't know what the hell to do next. And you never revisit areas either, once you leave an area you have 0 reason to ever go back. Compare this to Vesperia where you'd visit certain towns many times, and on top of that the towns all looked and felt unique, inhabited, and alive. They all had a purpose to the game's story and world. The locations in this game have zero relevance to the game's world, they just exist as graphical showcases so the devs could jerk themselves off forcing you to waste time with whatever stupid melodrama is occurring before showing you the next uninspired, boring location. Even the villains in this game have nothing to do with the story, they're introduced in cutscene A and then you kill them in cutscene D and then they literally never come back.

I have nothing positive to say about this game. The dialogue is some of the cringiest in any game I've played, it's so unbelievably idiotic at times I have to actually step away. Sometimes the combat is fun, but it's mostly repetitive and the bosses are the worst in any JRPG I've ever played. Dungeon design is non-existent unless you think a straight line is ""design"". And despite the decent graphics promising a next-gen experience, way too much of this game feels stuck in the past; so much dialogue is not voiced, the skits are lacking in animations, and the NPCs just stand around awkwardly. I dropped this game at the 5th lord and my only regret was the time I spent up until that point. This is without a doubt the worst JRPG I've ever played in my life. 1/10",1651971131,1662478730,False,3,0,0.199988111853599548,2,True,False,False

Graphically the game is ok looking for last gen, but nothing special.  My pc is hooked up to a 60in 4k tv; it made some scenes and text look oddly grainy at times. The CG effects are fairly good though. Later on when you have some of the top Arts, the screen can get a little busy. 

The characters are part of the downside.  Almost all are forgettable with lots of Anime grunting involved. Rinwell has a good arc, but Law is obnoxious as soon as he shows up.  The big problem is the models. Shionne has a semi-permanent T-pose and the other aren't much better. I may be biased, as I came to this game after Trails of Cold steel series.

Sound.  The soundtrack in the background is very good and well scored. It'll make you laugh though because the very first stage has huge swelling orchestral to it.

Story. Very anime. The combat is well paced but suffers later on from a lot of length padding.  While this is typical of JRPGs in general, the final chapter was egregious.  Most of the fights are just hidden exp farming later on.

In regards to your typical Tales of Games, the story is much more than what it seems. Especially this game specifically. There's a harsh realisation about slavery and freedom with this game, and is not afraid to show how cruel it can be. Some good lovable, and yet complex characters that are dealing with their own turmoil and problems. 

So let's get to some numbers.

Story 8.5/10 

Honestly overall good story, though it does get pretty crazy closer to the end of the game (which is normal for Tales of games). 

Combat 9/10 

Awesome combat, which move sets for both ground and air, you can make bad butt combos. Some bosses were awesome where you had to do certain mechs to be able to damage it, but some were so basic like button mashing on a human character. I never tried anyone other than the main character so I can't speak for their gameplay.

Music 8/10 

Once again, awesome music. JRPGs don't tend to miss in that regard

Graphics 10/10 

The best Tales of has been yet. Most of the landscapes are absolutely amazing, and the biomes are unique and beautiful. Plus cute owls

Overall 9/10

Great game, if you're tempted, buy it. ESPECIALLY if you're a JRPG or Tales of fan.

It is by no means a perfect game and has plenty of elements that are simply not enjoyable. However, compared to other JRPGs in the market it just does more things considerably better.

What was good? The cast is extremely enjoyable for me. Shionne, Rin, Law and Kisara develop naturally throughout the story. I rate this quite high cause JRPG usually have an immense problem with characterization - the best example is Alphen who is a copy/paste everything-good protagonist. Dohalim was fine but remains bland compared to the other mentioned names. Another thing that I rate highly compared to other JRPGs: There is not need for grinding. One of the most off-putting activities you can implement in your game. Tales of Arise manages that you stay on the required XP curve relatively naturally as long as you do not flee from all battles. The weapon and equipment feature is simple enough to not get overwhelmed or annoyed. Just give me stats, that is all I need to have, thank you. The side quests were mostly pretty fun, with a lot of zeugle hunting, but the dialogue added a certain level of depth to the characters as well. At least it was not a simple fetch quest in most cases.

What was bad? Fishing minigames in videogames, man. When will developers learn at last? That is one of the most boring and pointless features you can come up with. Poor Kisara has around 4K SP left without anything to learn cause I am not playing a fishing simulator.

Now, for the most important two elements: story and combat. I am twisted on both.

[b]Story:[/b]
The first part of the game was quite straight-forward and I enjoyed myself quite a bit. Yes, it is nothing exceptional in terms of writing, but at least it made sense and the end goal of beating all the lords made sense. The mini stories in between with the different moral dilemmas in each region gave the first part a certain flavour so that it did not turn boring too fast. Now, the second part did an anime. You know what this game needs? [spoiler]Aliens![/spoiler] It went full TRIGGER. The pacing in the second half just was way worse, the story less engaging cause it made everything way too convoluted. The ending was a positive turnaround again, but I simply did not enjoy the second part as much as the first one. Honestly, if the game ended after the fifth lord, slap some Renan endboss on top of that and call it a day.

[b]Combat:[/b]
The action button-smash combat took some time to get used to. Overall, I enjoyed it. In the beginning, when you only have 2-3 members building up combos was harder and the moves were kind of basic, so it was not as exciting. The combat peaked at the end of the first part of the game. In the last region, the combat was just a chore. The enemies were just meat shields while you beat on them for five minutes and dodging once in a while. 


Pairing the stale combat with the considerably weaker story, the game lost a lot of momentum by the end - which is kind of sad cause Tales of Arise is a good game. It does lots of things way better than other games. I just wish that there will soon be a JRPG that does not rely on the common tropes and adds some level of uniqueness. I have played Tales of Arise and I enjoyed it, no doubt, but it feels like I have played basically 90% of it already in the past.

I do recommend Tales of Arise, but would suggest to buy it on discount. Considering that I got it for 30€ further encourages me to praise the game - especially when I got it for the same price as the absolute travesty and straight money laundering game of Edge of Eternity (never not hating on that game).",1661610337,1661610530,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

Really liked this game! Gotta be honest, at first it was pretty ""meh"", but as I played it and as the story developed it was, in my opinion, a really solid game. This was my first Tales game, but since each entry in the series is self-contained (mostly, I hear Berseria and Zerteria were somewhat connected), I was able to enjoy the story from start to finish without worrying about any other Tales game.

My biggest complaint is that, like in a lot of these types of games, enemies are damage sponges (basically tanks) and could really open the game to feel a bit grindy. Luckily, they have a difficulty mode in place which can be changed mid game so I started it on the difficulty level right above normal (not the hardest difficulty), and as the game progressed and kept getting harder, I went down to the one right under normal (not the easiest difficulty). 

I don't really have the time nowadays to grind anymore so I like the fact I never had to do a single side quest or grind my way to the top, even skipped killing everything in the area I was traversing towards the end game, is a huge plus....Not sure about the easiest difficulty, but in the one right below normal, I still had to keep my A game and make sure I played as best as I could and go to every boss fight with a lot of HP/Mana recovery items and revival items as battles were still challenging at this level without any grinding.

In terms of gameplay, I found it very fun and combos felt very nice and simple enough to pull off. None of the characters ""boost break"" abilities felt useless and weak which I was honestly expecting.  None of the bosses or enemies felt too weak or too powerful. Bosses and secret bosses felt challenging, and many of them take advantage of certain character abilities. Venturing throughout the world and finding collectibles, herbs, and of course strong enemies is what one would expect. Lastly, the cooking system and the skits that follow it are features that I thought were very nice. Food makes doing certain task such as leveling up or fighting easier, and the skits offer character development where the main story cannot.

Speaking of the main story, I believe the first half was well paced and introduced conflicts well. The main characters felt likable, even though certain characters at first were quite unreasonable. The antagonists were okay, just your typical villain. Realizing that this is a review, I won't say much about the actual story, but the second half of the story, I feel, was rushed. Solutions to certain conflicts feel too convenient or easy to solve. When I finished the game, I still had some questions remaining regarding the story and certain characters. (Small Spoiler) Naori's story for example, I had many questions. Returning back to the rushed feeling, the final battle felt quite underwhelming for a Tales game. However, I do understand the reason behind the final boss fight playing as it did.

Overall, I think that the gameplay is fun, but the story a little rushed. Had the story been a little more polished and given more time, the game would've been a close to perfect game.

(Any spoilers in this review are vague and broad, I don't mention any plot specifics).

I really enjoy previous entries in the series, just never got around to seeing the credits roll. Don't know why I chose Arise to push through on, but here I am. For context, I stuck to the main story and did relatively little side content, which took 35 hours on easy. Extra play time is from an earlier, abandoned run. 

Visually the game is fantastic—it has really solid art direction and I personally love the visual style. The combat is also fun and fluid. Unfortunately, the title suffers in what, to me, is the most important part of any JRPG: character and narrative.

Characters:
While the first half-ish of the game is alright and the ending is decently satisfying, the characters are very one dimensional. Two of the cast never really develop beyond ""related to side character that is dead,"" and the rest are unfortunately pretty one-note. Rinwell and Dohalim are perhaps given the best treatment, in that they have decently formed arcs, albeit with rushed or shaky delivery in some aspects. The main duo weren't compelling enough that I found them interesting on their own, but their dynamic was good enough that I was invested in that, at least. The party dynamic felt lacking as well. While I can buy that everyone generally gets along (eventually), in some cases, I don't even know how, say, Kisara and Law feel about each other, which is not a problem I had with the larger cast of Vesperia, for example. It should be noted that outside of the six party members, this game does not have any characters of note. The protagonists, including the main one, were even flatter than the worst of the party.

I played in Japanese (interface and voice, so I can't speak for the English version), and felt that the actors all did a very good job.

Story and zones:
The story presented, to be brief, is a 15 hour story stretched out over 30-40 hours and about three too many locations, wherein 5 of the story hours are delivered in the very end in back-to-back cutscenes and exposition dump dialogue. Even in the first half where the game is fairly enjoyable, the story seems to only be able to do one thing at a time. (Vague zone spoilers ahead) Each of the first three zones introduces two of your six party members. There is one instance of foreshadowing for a later villain in zone two—that is it. Considering how much dialogue there is in this game, it seems strange that they didn't sprinkle in more character building or foreshadowing early on to help make some of the events later in the story feel less out-of-nowhere. These first three zones do tell a decently interesting and unique story, and each has a distinct visual identity. Unfortunately, the latter two of the five main zones, in my opinion, don't do much to differentiate themselves from the third in terms of design (zone 1 is brown, zone 2 is white, zone 3 is green, zone 4 is dark green, and zone 5 is green but it's raining for a little bit).

The second half:
After zone 5 the story attempts to do a quadruple backflip and lands on its head, leaving it to crawl, half-unconscious, towards the finish line for the next 10+ hours. This was the part of the game that spite fueled me through. There was so much talking (an actual straight hour, most of it inside of a grey room. This is not an exaggeration) that I was no longer able to focus for an entire scene as my mind inevitably began to wander. The already-high stakes get raised twice and at a certain point the cast beyond the main duo feels very out of place.  Enemies from the earlier game are recycled endlessly to pad for time with absurd amounts of health. I have heard that covid was responsible for much of the issues in the later game, but the reality is in this case that the better solution (not padding for time and cutting higher-end story stuff that becomes relevant only in the last 5 hours, leaving a shorter but more well-rounded title) would almost certainly have been less work than this solution.

I'm not sure I ever noticed the music in this game. So, neutral on that.

If you want a passable anime story, hours of any kind of content, and a beautiful backdrop to fun combat, you might really enjoy this game.

The combat system does not allow dodge cancel, leaving you vulnerable during attack animations. This is somewhat annoying but manageable if you are used to Souls games where you have to plan ahead your attacks. The attack queuing is way too sensitive and there is not way to turn it off (only an option to choose between short/long queuing time), which means you can easily get locked in an attack animation you don't intend to perform.

Besides these minor annoyances, the real deal breaker is the completely broken teammate AI in this game.

First, on Hard difficulty teammate constantly die due to taking damage while locked in attack animations. Disabling artes with long animations helps a bit but it doesn't solve the problem. This forces me to set team strategy to ""Heal only"" so they can properly dodge, rendering teammate completely obsolete.

Second, unlike previous titles of the Tales series, there is only a global strategy setting for all teammates and no way to set rules for individual teammates to suit their roles. 

Third, the settings themselves are very broken. There is no way to let AI to heal you with items so when I set AI to ""heal with item when teammate's health is below 50%"" the AI would heal themselves instead of the player. Then, in another instance of boss fight, I switched team strategy to be aggressive when the boss is knocked down so it's safe to attack, but when I switched the strategy back to ""do nothing"" the AI keeps on attacking and end up dying.

I haven't experienced any of these issues with previous titles of the series so it baffles me how the devs managed to botch it for this game. In an age where advanced AI is permeating every aspect of our daily life, it's completely unacceptable a prominent video game series fails to implement even a primitive binary logic decision tree. With its broken AI, I cannot consider this game a finished product therefore do not recommend this game.

<This review will be spoiler free, but will contain references to characters which exist>

Let's start with the story.

I've been a big fan of JRPGs for about 30 years, and in that time I've seen plenty of stories, this is one of the more frustrating ones.   While there are plenty of things that I generally like about it, the main characters and their motivations are just SO unrealistic.    Every character has their opinions, and despite having HEAPS of evidence that should change their minds about certain ideas, they just stay the same.    One character has a deep hatred for a specific race, and despite MANY acts of kindness, still hate that race until right near the end of the game, despite beating the player over the head with how obtuse they are being.

The motivations of the villains is boring and just bland.  Aside from Dollar General Sephiroth, none of them are terribly interesting, and he isn't even interesting once he starts talking. 

Graphics / sound design
The graphics are good / sound design is great -- but there's a LOT of repetitive talking.   Just chatter... every time Rinwell casts a spell she says the same line.  Every time a heal or a revive is being cast, the same voice line is said... it's just not a great experience overall.  Having 10-20 lines of commentary would've been better here.

Gameplay:
I'll be honest with you -- I played this game on HARD, and the battles were generally EXTREMELY easy from a mechanical standpoint, until you would hit an absolutely AWFUL boss (looking at Ooze Hive / Lord Ganabelt).  There's a few mobs which were extremely problematic as well (Ooze with their ability to chain cast a spell that can easily lock down a player).  Beyond this, even when playing on hard mode (extra SP), the rate of exp / sp acquisition is EXTREMELY slow, and serves no purpose but to extend the playtime of the game.   On hard mode monsters have nearly DOUBLE the health of monsters on normal mode, which makes even some basic fights DRAG, but boss fights which are meant to be 3-5 minutes long can drag on for more than double that due to how many bosses phase.   At one point I was grinding before fighting Ooze Hive (a problematic boss), and I spent about ~2 hours grinding.   Every time I ran through the ENTIRE sewer, I would fight / kill every mob and It worked out to around ~100sp, and ~300 experience.   I had 3 skills I wanted to buy on the main character, one was 960SP, another was 540, and a third was 360.  So that means I had to grind, running back and forth in the same zone about 19 times before I was ready to fight the boss.  This is not normal / good game design.   It becomes really evident that this is a cash grab when you realize you can buy boosts in the game to get up to 4x the rate of EXP / SP drops.    

After beating the ooze fight / lord ganabelt, I did what anyone should do here -- I fired up cheat engine and edited my SP / EXP on each character, and adjusted those to appropriate levels throughout the game.   I refused to pay an additional $20 to play the game with realistic scaling that respects my time.

Overall with a $59 price tag, I could not be more disappointed in the fact that they made the game contain predatory MTX like this.  

So yeah, overall verdict:  The battle system is nice, though enemies are bullet sponges in any difficulty beyond normal.   There's several highly problematic fights where you spend 80% of your time dodging and your AI allies still all die off so you lose. The graphics are nice, but aren't shockingly good. The story is entirely forgettable and doesn't represent anything new to the genre, and don't even really offer anything compelling to drive you through the game.

The combat early game is a ton of fun - by end game, you'll have your go-to combo setup or which arte you plan to spam every fight. As a result, the only reason to fight end game is for better weapons, but at this point large enemies have the same health pool as a boss fight. The game recognizes this and provides enough upgrade material so you can avoid grinding these fights the later you get into the game. 

The game also does a great job of staying in its lane. The characters aren't as deep as the game wants you to think, but they each have a different theme and the game sticks with those themes throughout.

The fishing mini-game is decent, but not amazing.

The costume DLC packs are worth it if you buy them before completing the 2nd city. The XP and skill point booster DLCs aren't needed if you properly utilize the cooking benefits at campfires. The remaining DLC is strictly for late game boosting for post-game fights, which you'll probably be so fatigued from the game that you'll never bother with them.

The combat was a hit and miss for me. I foolishly tried to beat this on hard mode without fully understanding the flow of combat and it was basically a slugging contest of smashing combos, consuming heal gels and repeating until boss or I died.   It wasn't until I actually found a character i liked using (kisara) and timing the blocks between combats that I really got the flow of things.  Utilizing boost attacks kept combos going until you hear the satisfying ding letting you know you could do a boost strike.  Boy were those flashy and cool!  Once I got used to it, the combat was a cinch and I could really see the game shine.

I love the characters in their game.  They're memorable, enthusiastic and well rounded.  The skits were well done and you could easily picture how they would banter and bicker amongst each other. I would consider the skits of this game the pinnacle of JRPG inter-party dialogue.  Even after the years have gone and I can't recall the plot of this game, I will fondly remember how Shionne struggled to connect with her teammates or how Alphen loved amping up the spicy food to the max.

I'm glad I stuck with this game and finished it, as it was well worth it.  Good job Bandai Namco and I can't wait until your next Tales of game.",1660435471,1660435471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. STORY: The game has a decent story which is engaging to some extent. However, unless you enjoy full shounen anime protagonist stuff, I'd say that you won't find the story good overall. It's full of cliches, and it's not very interesting. I play RPGs mostly because of the story, and this one is a no-no, so this is my main reason for giving it a negative review. (I'd also add that the characters suffer from the same problem).
2: COMBAT. It's pretty decent, but nothing spectacular. I got along by spamming the same attack always and forever, which is not a very good sign of well-designed combat gameplay.
These two points and the fact that I felt that this game recycled too much stuff from Code Vein are the main reasons for giving it a negative review.

Now on the positive:
1. I'd say that the game offers difficulties for everybody (whether you are looking for a decent challenge, for the biggest challenge, or you only want to see the story, there's a difficulty for you, and this is a yes-yes). 
2. I enjoyed a lot everything that wasn't main story. Much more funny and relatable that the main anime protagonist shenanigans of the main story.

So, on the whole, I'd say that you could enjoy the game, but if you are picky with your RPG stuff like me, I have more doubts about that.",1660394505,1660394645,False,1,0,0.488861382007598877,0,True,False,False

My first time around, I made it 6 hours in and was bored to tears, so I put it down. Having some spare time and nothing else to play, I decided to come back and power through it. Anyway...

From the things I've read, this entry into the Tales series is one of those ""You either love it, or you hate it"" kind of games. Honestly, I'm somewhere in the middle, but since Steam won't let me do that, I'm going to give it a positive rating, but just barely. 

What I liked about the game:

- Beautiful graphical style 

- Solid music, though they might have ripped off ""Back to the Future"" a little bit on a certain tune

- Great English voice acting -- for the most part

After that though, at least for me, the game just falls apart. 

- The combat: Everything is a damage sponge unless you play on Very Easy, then it's just boring because nothing is dangerous.

- Accessory Customization: What a chore of a system. Feels like some ridiculous thing you'd find in an RPG maker game. Super grind heavy to create anything worthwhile, and there really isn't a whole lot of incentive to do so. (unless you're some crazy sadist that wants to play on the highest difficulty and smack the mega sponges around for a week)

- The plot twists: The game waits WAYYYY too far into the story for the first plot twist. I was about ready to drop the game until it happened, and I still almost did.

With that said...

- The story as a whole: Honestly, it just wasn't all that interesting until the final ... 5 hours? Far too slow to develop, and that's a real shame too. Had they done a better job with pacing, I might have had a higher opinion of the game. 

In the end, it has a lot to offer to the right person, though I don't really feel like that person was me. I vastly prefer Tales of Berseria to Arise, and that's a hill I'm willing to die on.

I hope they don't bring this shitty microtransaction in the next game, I'm okay with paywalled skin, but core gameplay such as skill/arte tho, I despise that.

There was a lot of new vocabulary to pick up, a new fighting style to get comfortable with, and  characters I didn't really feel sold on until around the 3rd realm (~7 hrs in for me). By the end of my playthrough, even if there were things I still didn't fully understand or master, beyond the gameplay and even parts of the story, I really appreciated how much I got to see the characters interact, make jokes, and honestly work together to grow and explore their hurt & trauma (lol, Rinwell needed so much help here, but I mean that in an endearing way... mostly).

Compared to other JRPG styled games I've played (Persona 5 series & FFXV), similarly in Tales of Arise, it was the journey of an eventual group of friends that hooked me. This may speak more to what I look for in a JRPG, but as an anime fan who unironically enjoys watching the protagonist struggle, reach new heights, and save the world (most shonen plots), I think what makes that framework interesting then are the supporting characters and the story (world building, plot, presentation, pacing, etc.). While the story here wasn't what I expected, and probably could have been better in its finale, I really enjoyed what was here. It kept me to my 40 hr goal, and wrapped things up in a super warm way when all was said and done. Is it perfect? Nope, but did I enjoy the journey?

I am really enjoy the game mechanics. Side quests give a balance reward so they are always worth to do. All character had a unique skill set which indicate a different style of combat. However, some aspect of the game destroy the creativity the game try to provide.
- Arte level, the description behind this system is the frequency you use this arte the strong it is. This system is broken. You will never use new arte technique that game provide because you have been already level up the previous low level arte. Time is sunk so much for leveling until it is hard to discard the skill completely.  

For the story, this part is the most disappointed.
At first, I am really hyped for the game because this game presents an interesting plot about justice and freedom. This type of plot are often give us a symbolic and debatable story. The man was enslaved by something was a plot used in many media like in the movies ""The matrix"" or a game like ""Persona 5"". With high standard of the plot type and the potential that the game was advertised, I experience the cheap telling story compare to the standard plot type. This is the awkward list, I found

- The main protagonist is annoying. He is a blindly-optimistic character in a complex philosophical theme game. All he can do is shouting and waiting for shonen phenomenon to solve the problem for him. 
- The story is unbalance, the second part seem to be rushed. the game reveal the most important plot twist with a no name NPC!
- The story atmosphere is misplace. I feel like this is the after-apocalypse atmosphere instead of politic-slavery atmosphere. Almost cities are empty, the antagonist is hollowing. With the bad atmosphere lead to unclear direction of story. 
- The antagonist is not interesting at all. The game seem to be rushed on telling his motivation. The game try to morally compare the antagonist and protagonist. It is understandable but what is the point of comparing bland character to another bland character.
- The game cannot find a ways to ending it smoothly. At the final part of the game the game introduce new characters to manipulate behind everything. This is really bad writing, these new character are only existed in the story before the last fight to solve the dead-lock story. 
- Otherwise, I do not believed in love story of the main character at all. It seem forced. The chemistry between them is really awful. The protagonist just nice to everyone, I don't know why he fall in love with her. It seem the feeling is out of pity instead of loving one.

Decent gameplay with subpar characters (our heroes) and okay plotline. I say ""okay"" because the story loses itself in the later half of the game. The premise is rising against oppression and good vs evil forces.

----------
1. Excellent combat
2. It has variety of QOL features like the ability to fast travel anywhere to saved place anytime (unless when the story prohibits), quick re-spawn of ores for materials gathering, no random encounters, benched party members getting the same xp as active
3. Worthwhile accessories crafting. (Although the best accessories are towards the end of the game, they make the combat cakewalk when crafted the right combination for each party member)
4. Great music although too loud sometimes
5. Great voice acting (Played in English. Japanese seemed okay too)

1. Characters keep shouting their moves every time in the combat and no way to turn it off. Whenever you fast travel, get near a fishing pond, spend money at the store, they repeat the same dialogues. Get boring and irritating after some time.
2. Story initially seemed okay but towards the end became exposition dump with lame ending
3. At the beginning, the CP restoration items cost way too much and you would be tempted to buy the dlcs They don't download any new files and are just locked behind a paywall which is a shame.

Overall, a  great game. (It was my first Tales game)",1659780507,1659780636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And not just while exploring, they announce each and every move in combat that'll make your ears go numb. This game is full of anime cliches. Gets old very fast.

Combat is interesting at the start but enemies are bullet sponges and my fingers started hurting from the constant clicking. There are so many effects that half the time you can't tell what you or the enemies are doing. And don't get me started on the brain dead AI of the party. Ranged members will often go into melee range all on their own and die. Over and over. Way too much micromanagement needed.

Unlike Berseria and Zestiria which were directly connected, Tales of Arise plays in an universe of it's own, which I found very refreshing. However, Tales games are usually an acquired taste and for newcomers hard to get into.

If you're looking for a RPG with anime goofyness then this might be for you, however keep the points below in mind before you purchase.

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Better visuals than previous Tales games, while staying true to their art style.
[*]The boss fights and character designs are amazing.
[*]Sick looking artes (combat abilities).
[*]Voice acting is really good.
[*]No grinding required (started on Hard difficulty and never had to grind once).
[*]100% completion/achieves in one playthrough without having to play on specific difficulties (unlike previous games).
[*]You can re-fight all story bosses in a post game super boss rush.
[*]Fitting collaboration content and unexpected guests from another Tales game.
[*]Game is optimized and runs flawlessly without mods (unlike Zestiria).
[*]DLCs are not required and just fluff.
[*]Great Soundtrack.
[*]Controller support.
[*]Classic dumb Tales humor.
[*][b]INDIGNATION![/b]
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Tales controls. Very annoying for newcomers to get used to.
[*]Costumes unlocked in game without DLC are only recolors until late game.
[*]The twist kind of ruins immersion of the game and makes it feel more like Final Fantasy or SAO.
[*]No victory scenes, but I didn't mind personally.
[/list]

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Lots of cheesy and repeated dialogue, especially later in the game.
[/list]

I understand that this time they went with a love story (which was probably inspired by Sword Art Online or similar games) but compared to previous Tales games this one has probably the cheesiest dialogue of all, up to a point where it becomes a nuisance to listen to. Many things are unnecessarily pointed out multiple times in skits further into the game. Not sure if this was a mistake during localization/translation, but it makes it feel stretched out or lacking of creative writing.

Game beats it's predecessors in terms of combat and visuals, even Tales of Berseria.
The character cast is not as good as Berseria's, but they eventually grow on you.
Especially the little jackass and the noble chad stand out a lot.

Edit*

OK, I reviewed this too early. Now that I'm in what I am guessing is the second half of the game after the intro changes to the new one like a new season of an anime... The sadistic programmers of this game decided to give you access to ridiculously overpowered bosses too damn early. Example: Rinwell wants a flower that grows somewhere. Cool, I'm level mid-thirties so let's check this out! Oh! Did we find it guys? Wait, we're getting ambushes by a LEVEL 52 boss. Boss proceeds to one hit kill everyone. Another instance: Hey one of those lights that fell to Earth. Let's enter it! After a no break marathon of enemy fights of fairly hard enemies, again at level mid-thirties... Big boss time everyone! LEVEL 65 ****ing boss! Summons previous enemies, kill them with difficulties. Summons a death phoenix that one hit kills everyone while shooting environmental lazers that just about one hit kill you. Yeah I get it, you're no where near strong enough yet. WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ME ACCESS TO THESE MISSIONS THEN?! I am more than 20 levels away from even having a chance against the weaker one! You made me spend like 20 minutes fighting several enemies with no breaks to get to a boss that blows on me and kills me. That is just stupid! Wait till at least 5 levels away. I dragged some of these battles out for more than half an hour with pure skill just to be cheaped into a one hit tail spin kill because I was stuck in a skill animation.

Also you can visit a hot springs, although that's more of a Bandai Namco thing.

To outline various quality of life improvements over previous entries:

- Cooking never fails, lasts for a time duration, and it tells you who's good at it
- Expansive fast travel, which can generally put you in the neighborhood of where you want to be unless plot stuff is happening, which it often is
- Menus hotwired to the options buttons while attacks are regular buttons with no added inputs needed
- Dodge mechanic set up to allow you to counter instead of just lowering damage
- Overlimits trigger as soon as you earn them
- Mystic Artes that are actually possible to perform given the conditions (glares at [i]Berseria[/i])
- Titles now organize unlockable artes and abilities, which means there's a point to getting them rather than COLLECTION
- Equipment that can be synthesized but does not need to be upgraded ten to one hundred times for diminishing returns (exception: Accessories, but you can manage with lesser ones)
- A level cap at 100, accompanied by a post-game dungeon that is NOT longer than the entire rest of the game
- OWLS as non-annoying mascot characters

As far as new material added, the game added Boost Attacks, which are individualized for your party members and useful on certain types of enemies, along with Boost Strikes, which combine two users attacks into one powerful hit.  This is often set up by another new stat, Penetration, which adds to the enemy's stagger meter.

If you're new to the franchise and want a place to start, you could do a lot worse.   Veterans might complain about some of the lost meta in making everything more complicated, but for my money, the experience of a [i]Tales[/i] game doesn't ever need to be complicated because the plot sure isn't.

The best Tales of in the series so far, good gameplay, the maps never feels too big like Berseria did, no dungeon feels that they are too intense and the only dungeon that takes ages for you to do is the final one. The best battle system too, it's not as annoying as Berseria or Zestiria, the sound effects aren't weird either and it's easy to understand combos and special systems so far. The story is very good, the ending could be a little more flashed out, having a little more dialogue with a timeskip of a year or so with Alphen talking what happened after the final battle and what happened overall, because most of it you have to guess, and I do like ambiguous endings, I also like when stuff is actually explained and names are given. Especially after they made me care for the world so much in this game. 
I think that as  far as emotions goes, the game itself is the best ride, the ending is not as emotional or heartbreaking as Zestiria and Bersiai, both games with bittersweet endings but endings so good that made me think about them for weeks. This one is good, just not that level of good. However, the story and build up of the story, the world building and the character interactions, dialogues, etc, ar far superior than those two games. 


In the end, this is a very good game, that fixed a LOT of issues I had with the previous, but has some annoying things here and there (you can read more down if you want). But I think this is a musf for you to play. Nothing is perfect, but this game cast of characters is close to that. 


[h1] The good [/h1]
[+] Good worldbuilding.
[+] Good gameplay.
[+] Good story.
[+] Good characters.
[+] Good battle system.
[+] Good music.
[+] Good dialogues between party members and battle.
[+] Good expressions (so far this is the most expressive tales game ever).
[+] Good plot and romance baits here and there without forcing them on us.
[+] Good dungeons and maps overall never feeling too big or too tiring.
[+] You can save anytime, that's a plus.
[+] The most optimized game so far,
[+] Two openings, one in Japanese and one in English by the same singer. 
[+] The fact that the opening was licensed so I don't need to use mods to enjoy the original song is awesome.
[+] An extra mid-point opening as beautiful as the initial one, avoiding mid-game spoilers.
[+] Fishin minigame very well done.
[+] The game recognizes that Steam is using the PS4 controller while emulating the Xbox Controller in the overlay and STILL shows me the DS4 prompts. That's a HUUUUGE thing most AAA games don't do. I still prefer the ability to CHOOSE what prompts I want the game to show me instead of this clownery but at least the game is done right in this regard.
[+] [SPoiler] The ending when Rinwell hugs Shionne is the best friendship development of the century, thank you very much.



[h1] The bad [/h1]
[-] The difficulty sometimes feels unbalanced.
[-] Certain side-quests are available and you can only finish them on the end-game.
[-] Certain places have a big gap in level bewteen your party and enemies, but no matter where you go, nothing will give you good exp to grind faster, forcing you to end the game and spend tons of time on the last dungeon to try and tackle certain quests.
[-]  Higher level enemies doesn't seem to give you a LOT of exp either, at lv 50 - you can defeat a lv 65 monster struggling a lot, and still will receive most to none exp. Even with boost food.
[-] The grind can be very intense here, way too much.
[-] ITems cost way too much, even a character constantly complains when you buy the bare essential for survival. There are ways to make money, but most of them happen after chapter 3 AND they still take a long time.
[-] There are a lot of things you will be forced to do late game, and that's a bummer. Especially if you want to finish everything before going to the main quests. IT's annoying when a boss opens for you to kill him just for you to be constantly hit-killed by him because you need 15 levels. These quests should be at least a post-end game sidequests instead. 
[-] The game does not have a LOG option, every single JRPG should have these. It's not hard to do, it's literally a HUD with boxes and a scroll that grabs the previous 100 texts that happened on screen, live-text or dialogue text with NPCs or story text or battle text, and show it to us once we enter that window. I play the game in Japanese because I find the dub unberable for me, and the dialogue on battles is awesome, but it's impossible to read, or live dialogue while you walk happens so fast I can't read them either. Even in English if you don't pay atention you will lose some very interesting and funny exchanges and I hate that.
[-] Spoilers here: The game has a good ending, however they should have given us a monologue of Alphen talking about what happened with the three words, the satelite of Lenegis, the remains of Rena and Dahna, all of them fused together BUT we don't know how the new planet is called, if the energy of the planet could still mean a threat or if it's on balance, we don't know how people are dealing with everything and so on. We don't even know what happen with the guys on the space station that are checking on the situation from afar. In the end, I feel there's a lot of loose threads I wish were explained and a 10 minutes monologue while showing images of everything would be awesome. The credits sequence is fine, but frankly I wanted more. Especially after all that buildup with the characters.",1656915286,1658945342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Plot is absolutely garbage.



Was repeatedly told this was one of the best written Tales of game in recent times... and Its not; The story is the most generic trope-ey garbage possible, filled with plot holes and weird nonsensical moments if you stop and think about it, and with tons of wasted potential... and some really fucked up mishandling of racism and classicism 
[spoiler] Like making every single villain you run into a turbo, genociding, past comically-evil space nazi... then trying to lazily humanize them in the endgame, on a sidequest that makes you talk to 5 people who just reinforce they only cared about their own people/noble houses, and yet the party goes ""they had people they cared about too, so they cant be that bad""

Visually the game is wonderful, having an great painted-ish look that is very unique, and general art design is very good.

Gameplay feels great, and is really fun and easy to use on mouse and keyboard (specially if you have a mouse with 5 buttons), feeling legitimately satisfying to learn and master, BUT... a lot of enemies tend to be massive damange sponges, where even at the right level, with the right gear, you'll end up wasting a lot of time on them, the boost mechanic also feels a bit poorly thought out:

-Each character has an ability you can use when its charged, and each ability counters an enemy type/move.
-Except the game downright expects you to use those moves, and it takes a while to charge, add to it multiple enemies of the same kind, or multiple spellcasts going off in quick sucession and you will be left completely unable to counter enemies, which makes fights absolutely miserable,

And then there are bosses... every single boss in this game is the absolute culmination of every bad element of the fighting system:
-They are ALL damage exponges that dont flinch/react to any of your attacks unless you use the right boost ability on them.
-Bosses who have abilities like charging or dodging (which require specific boost uses to counter) will keep spamming those abilities endlessly, far faster than the boost will charge.
-Spellcasting bosses will just keep repeatedly spellcasting in quick succession, not allowing you to counter them, and their spells will do TONS of damage to the party, the player controled character can dodge, but the AI will usually fail at it.
-Some bosses have visual cues that tell you to use one of your boost abilities... but are imune to it; One spellcasting boss in particular has the game specifically tell you to counter them, except that doesn't work.
-Some bosses have super moves that will absolutely wreck your party if they get it off, to get it off you need to have a correspoding boost ability ready, and wait for a quick time event to pop up; Except this only applies to the first time they use their super, the moment after you counter it once bosses will (like with spellcasting) keep spamming their supers constantly, only you can no longer counter them (I thought it was just that you did not get the quick time anymore, but after extensive testing I found you just literally cant counter)
-This is not a problem for the player who can perfect dodge through the crazy AO most of the time (its surprisingly easy) but your AI party will get completely wiped.

The game also (aparently, as this is how I personally feel its design goes) expects you to grind, a lot; Just fighting every enemy you run into is nowhere near enough, and you are going to have a hell of a time if you play like that, with the game seemingly expecting you to repeatedly enter and exit dungeons/areas to collect materials and craft stuff.

Also, if you are a compulsive completionist like me, you will absolutely despite this game's sidequests, namely because you get two at the very start of the game that you can only go back to complete after the midpoint (if even that); One of which being a level 40+ boss that is literally just hanging around one of the first few areas of the game (with a quest specifically telling you to go fight it obtained from the first real town you visit)
By the time I reached the midpoint of the game, you should be about level 37 or so, if you did not grind; Its at this midpoint that the game further gives you another sidequest to go fight another boss... that is level 50+ instead.

Basically, sidequests in this game are ass and will cause suffering for people who like/need to complete all sidequests before moving on with the plot.


Oh, and massive spoilers that are both a positive and a negative.
[spoiler] This game literally pulls a nier automata, has a girl in red with a hime-like haircut and unnatural facial expressions show, said girl aparently has clones and can teleport, after she shows up in what the game built up as the final dungeon... you get a new opening and Tales of Arise 2, for all intents and purposes, starts right there and then.
This is also when the game absolutely bombards you with mountains of sidequests.

The writing was neither sharp nor touching, and the characterization was so divided between the generic ""defeat the evil god"" main plot and the long and boring skits that constantly flood you with meaningless anime b******t. Don't get me wrong, I like anime and I used to love this series. But the writing was so empty and robotic that I felt like watching some tone-dead, toothless documentaries.

Gameplay-wise, the camera control needs significant improvements to meet modern gaming standard, and the UI design can seriously use more QA-testing (the campsite screen keyboard control is fixed to default mappings EVEN WHEN THE IN-GAME NOTIFICATION INFORMS YOU TO PRESS YOUR CUSTOMIZED KEYS, yet the devs never fixed the bug cause they don't care). The character progression system is badly explained, poorly organized and frustratingly slow and grindy, especially in the early game, of course, unless you spend extra money to get the double EXP/ SP DLC the devs clearly hope you to purchase.

As a Tales of veteran, I'm genuinely happy to see this RPG series got more recognition, and the graphic overhaul was definitely no small feat. But beneath its shiny new graphics, Arise sadly kept too much of the series' long-standing problems and, in some aspects such as writing quality and character progression, even took a huge step-back in my humble opinion. If you enjoys satisfying high-pace combat, I would recommend trying TODR (PS2) or TOG (Wii) instead. If you desire good characterization and intriguing story, I would recommend TOS (GameCube/ PS2) or the other TOA (Abyss, on PS2).

This game fell short of what it could have been: A Tales Of masterpiece...that didn't happen.

[spoiler]
Visually beautiful, smooth battle mechanics, plenty of character customization without the overly complex armour/weapon building mechanics of other titles like TOB. I enjoyed that most of the game was not spent calculating armour values and combinations, they've really streamlined the system. Same great Tales of cutscenes with many character interactions help to get the player invested in the story. Combat is relatively straightforward and easy to learn. Pathways between areas don't feel like an absolute boring maze of constant grinding and are well balanced for enemy populations.

At times this game uses extreme plot devices such as slavery, war, state surveillance, etc. to cover a lack of proper Worldbuilding. It became a generic plot and boring tropes with an excessively pretty coat of paint. Yes there are beautiful visuals, but it doesn't make up for the bland story. The second half of the game feels rushed, off, and the plot is outta left field, but not enough to be fun or quirky or peak the viewers interest.

Worldbuilding is was okay at best. For a AAA title, there should've been plenty of depth and lore. However, the Tales of series is now infamous for 25 years of the same recycled plot device: a world stealing energy from another world. It would have been nice to see new and fresh ideas in terms of the story. Adding insult to injury is the use of Cliche characters and poor emotional expression. What remains is a dilutional and cliche plot that's highly predictable and more of a headache than an interest.

Also headache inducing are the blinding battle moves, especially late game. The battle system is smooth and fluid, but there were times where I was button mashing my was through the battle because of all the blinding flashing lights on the screen. Mystic Art gameplay is great, but brightness should be better adjusted for and balanced, not seizure inducing.
Also frustrating are the boss fights: long drawn out bouts of tickle damage to Tanks. [/spoiler]

6/10 a pass, but nothing to post to TiKTok about.

The way they give out gald and resources is clearly trying to encourage you to throw a couple bucks at the cash shop to buy those 100k gald packs. But as someone who played NES JRPGS I'm perfectly happy spending some time farming resources to catch things up, so for me this wasn't a problem personally. I could see it annoying people who hate stopping main story to do side content and farm mobs though.

The combat system is fine. I never enjoyed the ""Tales of ___"" style combat on keyboard and mouse, but I picked up a controller to play Elden RIng, and this feels much better with the controller in my opinion. The combat is serviceable; it's not adding anything amazing to the gameplay experience, nor is it wasting my time as a pain point. It's just there, and it's fine.

I found the story (especially early on) very compelling. I thought they dove into some difficult topics in interesting ways, and for the most part did it in a way that felt engaging. There were some points that started to feel tropey, but for the most part they did a good job of making me care about most of the characters. They even ended up making me really like a character I thought I would hate. 

So what's the problem then? So far this sounds like a 7/8+ out of 10 review, and should lean on the side of recommending the game, right? For me, the problem occurs after the ""one month later"" break in the story (leaving it vague for spoiler purposes.) Something happens with the narrative direction that bothers me on a fundamental level. Again, for the sake of spoilers I won't go too deep into it, but at this point something about the game begins to feel very wrong. The in combat banter of some of the characters starts to swing wildly, and one character in particular goes from having pretty standard talking points to becoming very overemotional and sappy. It felt very out of place and kind of came out of nowhere, and was honestly pretty off putting. 

To be fair, I haven't finished the game yet. And it's largely because after getting to this point, the game went from something fun to something that seems to be going out of it's way to annoy me. Little bits in the game that felt like they were just anime tropes are now coming off more like virtue signaling. Rather than the characters acting in such a way that makes them compelling, they just kind of talk about how people should act and feel about things. Stuff I could easily brush off before now just stick in and annoy me.

At some point I will probably finish this game at some point. Not because I really care about the story anymore, or because I need to know what happens to the characters (like in most RPGs), but because I just want to see it through. But the fact that I'll finish this game out of something more akin to obligation or duty rather than interest or engagement is why I don't recommend this game. A lot of people might think it's great, but for me it struck all the wrong chords at the wrong time, and now the game feels more like an emotional lecture in morality than an epic adventure.",1658541030,1658541030,False,1,0,0.504331588745117188,0,True,False,False

Team AI is stupid. They don't always use moves that take advantage of elemental weakness. This being an active battle game, micromanaging maybe 3-4 moves out of 30 is a hassle.

If you're a fan of JRPGs you will probably like this, but you've also probably seen this before. Maybe not as pretty in graphics. The combat is decent and is a nice change for Tales to an extent. However there are many cut corners which should not be ignored just because it is a good game. The story feels rushed around the second half. Many character setups are fantastic but do not evolve past a basic level understanding of who they are. 

What really frustrates me is the very evident padding in this game. There are so many recolors of the same enemy. There are so many dialogues which just honestly waste your time by covering the same points. You will see other comments that say this and it is sadly true. I love lore and dialogue. I found myself getting sick of it here. Usually I can tolerate many JRPG speeches and the like so it is outside the norm that it got to me.

I think the untapped potential of the game is what makes me falter. I love the characters and what I could see in them, but i feel like the game does not play to its strengths with them. Holding necessary development until the end of the game is one thing I think that holds the story back tremendously. If the characters were allowed to change a bit more as they went through the game, we could have more interesting scenarios and many of the scenes would not feel so one note. We all know there is always romantic tension in JRPGs, but this one would benefit from allowing all the characters to progress. Just to give them something beyond ""generic JRPG hype speech"" to discuss.

Too many of the skits feel like they are recaps of what you just saw.

I still think it is worth your time. I still enjoyed it. I still was happy at the end. I still like the game. I think combat could use some refinement as well. The action style of things is very nice. Perhaps what made it start to get tiring was that there were so many rehashed enemies. 

Overall I would give this a 7/10. It's not something I see myself replaying but it was worth my time.

This is going to be relatively detailed, but I'll go over what's to like and dislike in as concise a manner as possible. If you don't wanna read everything TL;DR is as follows: 

Combat nice, but has issues with stunlocking to the point that it's unfair. Boss designs imo are just not good, but normal combat is fine and dropping difficulty just for bosses is perfectly feasible and there's no shame in it. Money is a concern but just do ranching as much as you can until you can get rappigs etc. Use items moderately (expensive but necessary, balancing act here). Story is interesting with not much tropes, overall very nice. Have to give 7/10 just because of the combat/boss designs.

Detailed below.

Combat system: Stellar, not the best ever but very stellar. Perfect dodges are made easier with skills and make sure you change around accessories and artes whenever you need to. Keep your weapons for later enhancement and sell off armour that you replace since those have no value other than reselling. Combat is dynamic and fun, but can get repetitive due to the large health pools of enemies. Learn how to break and stagger enemies with efficient arte combinations, and focus on enemies that the AI are attacking to maximise the stagger gauge. Using elements enemies are weak to is always a good idea, but not essential to getting through most fights. Use boost strikes as soon as they are available just for damage or stagger. Alphen's is great, use it often. Use his blazing sword moves as well.

Story: Interesting, fairly well paced, touches on intriguing topics and challenges certain beliefs of the characters. Interactions between characters are always fun to watch, and I love hearing the little tidbits that really give each character their well...character. Some cliches, but overall nothing so bad that it made me just want to die or anything.

Voice acting: As always stellar, I'm playing in Japanese because that is how I do things. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka literally carries the dynamic though, no one is as expressive as him, so look out for Law's voice lines they're great.

Main complaints:

This game stunlocks you on hit. This guarantees that you will be hit by follow-ups, so to a degree this is situational awareness/skill but also luck or lack thereof. And to be completely clear on what I mean by stunlocking as a lot of games do this, I really mean that both Scarlet Nexus and this game have this dumb stunlock when you get hit that leaves you rooted to the spot with no invulnerability frames and completely exposed to follow-up attacks. This is completely different from other ""hard"" games such as Dark Souls where you do get invulnerability on dodging, or like God Eater or Monster Hunter where you get tossed a short distance away on getting hit. For this game and SN, no matter what you get hit by you get stunlocked the same as long as you don't fall down. This means that getting knocked down is often times better than taking a glancing hit, because at least you get clear of follow ups thanks to flying a small distance away even if it takes you longer to get back up.

As an example, there will come a section after meeting [spoiler] Rinwell and you're going through the waterway [/spoiler] where you get her boost strike to interrupt artes, and you will get a group of like 5 enemies that only cast artes. You've never encountered this before. So the thing is it's not possible to interrupt all 5 of them, and I went into this fight without saving because I was just running the section. I got hit with the first arte, a ground-bursting water arte that hits three times. But 3 of the 5 enemies targeted me, and after getting hit with the first one I was stunlocked, couldn't move or dodge, and as a result once the first hit the other 2 hit guaranteed. So naturally I immediately died. That was some bullshit, because before that all other fights could be progressed through sometimes without taking any damage at all. This only really happens in this section due to having less party members, being more susceptible to damage etc, but still can happen if you're unlucky. Another case, the [spoiler] jumping ape dudes, if you see all of them jump, or like one after another, just run. I made the mistake of only dodging the first one then engaging, which got me hit by the second, stunlocked, then got hit by 2 more and died. [/spoiler]. This makes boss battles very difficult as well, as sometimes you'll just get clapped by one hit and good job, you're now stunlocked into getting hit by all their other lengthy chain follow ups and potentially dying and wasting a life bottle (which costs like 1k that's not cheap) or CP that you might need later on.

Which brings me to my next point, which is boss design. You can't break or stagger bosses so this deviates completely from your normal combat, adding to the extremely inflated health pools the bosses have, and it becomes more a battle of attrition and frustration. Yes, you are supposed to learn boss attack patterns and when to attack and when not to, but the lack of windup for the human bosses makes life very difficult and their ability to combo you into oblivion for a single mistake is frankly ridiculous. Adding to the fact that dodging distance is miniscule compared to the distance bosses can cover with just a single attack or worse, a string of attacks that can kill you ez, it makes many moves actually impossible to dodge. Unlike dark souls or souls-style games, those give you the ability to go truly untouched with skill, patience, and learning. This does not. You are going to get hit, often times making you go ""yo why the F*** did that hit me?!"", so be prepared for that.

This is okay at the start, but gets super bad with even the [spoiler] second lord thanks to his shield, and just gets subsequently worse as the game goes on. [/spoiler] So combine that with the expensive af items, and that's a recipe for no money and no fun. When you hit 50% on any boss, you get a special strike attack (forgot the name), that literally does NOTHING. NO DAMAGE. WHY HAVE IT. Sometimes it just ruins your combos and it's dumb. This is the definition of just fighting with the design rather than true difficulty since you are punished brutally for any mistakes, while having extremely long boss battles that are just repetitive spamming of 1-2 artes then running around until another opening occurs. And long fights means lots of opportunities to make singular mistakes that basically kill you thanks to stunlocking. So be prepared to over-level or just drop difficulty because it's not worth it. If a big boss charges you while you're close to it, good luck, you're getting smacked. No way to dodge out of it unless you perfect dodge. So get good at that. Or hope you have [spoiler] Kisara's [/spoiler] boost strike.

Frankly with this and Scarlet Nexus, I think it says a lot about how Bamco needs to correct their philosophy and idea approval for boss designs nowadays. There is a difference between true difficulty and just unfair mechanics, and they need to learn that difference.",1658074880,1658454469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fight is chaotic, character customization is great(liking the accessory customization), and the scenery is pretty.
The cinematography is top-notch especially during Mystic Artes(super moves for those uninitiated) and Boost Strike(new feature from Arise).

One feature that actually different this time is the boss Mystic Artes.
Instead of your typical cutscene, the boss MA is a full screen attack that you can dodge and prevent.
This is awesome because it adds to the chaotic feel and sense of urgency.
One of the bosses actually casts one trademark spell from Tales series.
I play too many Tales games to recognize the incantation, even though it is altered. 
I literally stopped attacking and let that Mystic Artes to hit and wipe my party. WORTH IT!!

The English voice acting is great. 
I might do second playthrough in the future with English voice.
This is coming from a player who always play jRPG with original/Japanese voice acting.

For completionist players, this game is also great to play.
It only takes me 1 playthrough and 70+ hours to unlock all achievements, which is pretty short compared to other Tales games. 
For comparison, I did 2 playthrough of Tales of Berseria(120+ hours) and I still have not unlocked everything.

tl;dr. A great game for jRPG players and the worth successor of Tales-of series.

If you're looking for a game with good character development and intriguing interactions and bonding between them then I think you will enjoy this game. As with other tales games, its characters and the way they interact together is its bread and butter. The skits were very good, almost as good as the standard cut scenes, always worth watching, some are quite funny and really show the interaction between the characters and reveal things about them that the story doesn't on its own. 

I'm a slower player, I wanted to collect everything I could and did every sidequest I could. I still have some more if I choose to go onto new game + or do the post game subquests as well. All in all I sunk nearly 80 hours into this game, I highly recommend you immerse yourself in the story and characters. If you're a faster player, you might get through it in 60 hours or less, but YMMV. 

This game had one of the best OPs I've seen and its animated scenes were beautifully done. Once again Bandai Namco has released a great game here, and any JRPG fan, Tales fan, or anyone with a soul and enjoyment of fantasy/sci fi will get something from it. 

The combat, I felt, was very well done, it didn't feel overly complex like in some other Tales titles. I didn't have any issues understanding the overlimits and how to execute specific artes or mystic artes. Combat was something I didn't intend to spend much time focused on, and started out playing story mode, but switched the difficulty early on to be more challenging due to how enjoyable it felt. Ultimately the combat felt smooth and fun and I kept coming back for more and ended up grinding out battles just to practice or have a blast.

With Zestiria especially, I really wasn't feeling its combat for some reason, & the characters felt unusually boring for a Tales experience. It felt like Vesperia was the last ""sacred"" installment w Xillia being CLOSE in its style w likable characters & fun combat, but a tired story w cliched character backgrounds. It felt like the series was becoming something other than its best format & getting lazy in areas, writing-wise, & the new map exploration style felt like it made too many areas feel ""samey"". Zestiria, for me, just freakin' KILLED it all completely & had me convinced Tales had gone the way of FF. Just a shadow in name only to what it once provided its fanbase...

THAT being said, this installment, I'm happy to say, has been very engaging w those newer stylizations(maps, combat, etc.) actually feeling VERY well done! The combat actually feels great, the map sections have a nice graphical vibrance to 'em without feeling ""cut & paste"" & I actually feel interested in the cast & their relations to each other! Seriously! I'm a 43yr old gamer who is very stuck in his ways, who thinks that Melee is the best Smash ever made & that Final Fantasy pretty much died w part X! Lol
So if that says anything, ...I wholeheartedly have been having an actual BLAST with this game like I haven't felt in awhile! It feels like a fresh classic of its own, even though it's not the old Tales format I was accustomed to, it feels like something new & welcome w a similar sense of delivery on multiple counts! Definitely feeling that fun, intriguing, satisfying Tales rush!

I wouldnt consider myself a devote fan of the series, but I did enjoy Vesperia and Berseria when I played those a few years ago. Fast Forward to Arise and I have no hesitancy in saying that this, to me, is miles above those 2 games and right up there with the best JRPG's I've ever played.
The Graphics, whilst still maintaining the Cartoon / Anime style, have been massively upgraded from years past and look amazing.
The combat is insanely addictive, stringing combos together and creating Boost Arte opportunities were incredibly fun.
Just when you think the combat might get a bit repetitive, Tales ""Ups the Ante"" by introducing another skill or ability, that adds a whole new dimension to the combat system.
The Story, is far and away the best part of the game, it really made me develop a connection to the Characters. Going through their Friendship, their hardships, their regrets and their triumphs. It manages to have the feel of classic JRPG's (community / race of people in peril, mysterious stranger steps in to help), but it also adds in a lot of human elements and some quite grown up themes.
 In the other Tales games I played, there were always a few ""throwaway"" characters, that were either annoying or useless in combat. Not the case in Arise, all characters have been developed very well and are very useful in battle.
Ray Chase as the voice actor for the Protagonist was a very strong choice in my opinion, he played Noctis in FFXV and Nier in ""Nier Replicant"" to name a couple of my other favourites.
I also wanted to mention the Cutscenes. Far too many games make cutscenes boring or just non stop talking all the time, and whilst there is a fair bit of dialogue in this game, the action cutscenes honestly had me on the edge of my seat. 
If you are hesitating on buying this game, I hope this review helps. I bought it during the summer sale, but since playing it, I would have quite honestly bought it at full price. 
I completed the game in about 55 hours (little bit of XP grinding and most of the sidequests too) and I'm going to continue playing to wrap up the rest of the optional areas. The game also has New Game + when you've finished it too.

In short: another Tales game but run on Unreal Engine and very beautiful and Tweak-able to enhance the experience of cool anime flashy actions of Tales series. The story still very Tales (Anime settings, Anime jokes, Anime twisted, Anime Template)

The story is about rising against oppression and then scaled up Anime Style. Most dialogues are very predictable if you watched lots of Anime. Some Cutscenes are long but there's not too many cutscene. The Dialogue skits ,on the other hand, there're lots of them. You can skip them or watch them as you pleased.

The Gameplay is still the traditional Tales series you go along the story, run into Enemies/Events then you fight and earn Exp/Skills improve your party to the endgame Anime-God-Hero. something like that. The Combat Animations are Very Flashy and fun to play. There're Over-limit move (2 Special Mystic Arte for each character) Finisher Combos (2 characters finishing combo (30 combinations of 6 characters?)) these looks and sound very impressive every time they're used.

Bought the Standard edition but then realized some skill trees are bound to the costume DLCs, decided to let them go and just enjoy the 80% of accessible part of the game. still have enough fun.

Summary: Good game. DLCs situation is always the same BaNam style.

Just combats upon combats of the same hp-sponge mobs, and dozens upon dozens of the same repetitive, dull cutscenes adding nothing or going over the same concepts again and again. Like, sometimes literally just seconds apart. Or those vignette-style optional cutscenes right after a regular cutscene, adding nothing of note.

Visuals and animations are the game's strongest point. Combat is ok but could be way better by cutting HPs in half. It kinda looks like it heavily relies on you to perfect dodge, yet there's no dodge cancelling, turning it into a waiting game, which plays against the feeling of fast-paced gameplay; plus there's a lot of visual clutter, which makes it hard to keep track of all mobs. Also, a somewhat minor and very specific thing: when you reach lategame and all chars have enough action points, not half a second goes by during which there isn't at least one character shouting their moves' names; an annoying incessant stream of them.

As for the other aspects of the game, there aren't many. Very linear exploration, few collectibles/items/materials worth obtaining (except owls and an odd artifact or two). A bland farm system, bland weapon crafting system, an ok accessory crafting system (that I barely touched because I didn't want to deal with randomness of stats and its consequent grind). And then, the story is just boring; again, generic JRPG story turned worse by repeating the same concepts ad nauseam. The game does touch some interesting themes, but they're mostly drowned by the repetition. What's the point of a character showing growth if they're gonna do it 50 times, exactly the same way.

Anyway, I don't consider myself impatient, nor does it happen often that I feel like dropping a game towards the end, but that's how it is with Tales. If you're an avid JRPG fan go for it; otherwise, be advised",1657998775,1657998775,False,5,1,0.510609149932861328,0,True,False,False

This [b]wasn't[/b] a game I sat and completed within a few hours, and moved on. It's a game I [i]truly[/i] took the time to enjoy over a long while, getting to know the characters like close friends of my own. I think a lot of people who rush through this game miss much of it's beauty.

I watched every skit (there's over 300 of them), every cutscene and cinematic (there's over 16 hours worth), and played the game until I found absolutely everything. When I made it to what I thought was the end of the game, it turns out, it was only the [i]halfway point.[/i]

In my opinion this would have been a better anime than a game.  If you're looking for an anime-type game that is visually pleasing and has a fun gameplay that is a little less repetitive and more engaging I'd recommend Scarlet Nexus, the plot isn't as good but it's more fun in my opinion.

Long Version:

I compare this game to Scarlet Nexus alot because they share a lot of similar features, like being an anime-type game, companion based, etc.

Story:
The story is rather long and has alot of development for each character that enters your party with quite a bit or world building. It starts off pretty slow but then it spirals into the basic trope of Good and Evil but dissects it bit showing the grey from the black and white (I'm probably over selling it a bit). I'd say the story is the star of this game.

Visuals:
Anime-type games always had the problem of needing to be modeled in a 3D environment but what they did here is almost exactly like Scarlet Nexus, its so good that it almost looks exactly like an anime but you can still notice a bit that it was generated in a 3D environment (it also doesn't help that they show cutscenes every now and then in anime format to remind you how anime looks like in contrast). This would my second favourite thing about the game. It even did the companion skits better than Scarlet Nexus in my opinion.

Gameplay:
This is where the game nose-dives for me. At the beginning the game it is really refreshing as it's a bit different styled that is very engaging... Until you do it one thousand times the exact same way. 

The gameplay is very similar to Scarlet Nexus but instead of focusing on powers you are using a type of sword/magic but one thing that this game does that I though I could over look is that everytime you encounter a group of enemies (its always in a group) it will drop you in an arena-type area with enough space to fight in (Area is still limited though to where you can go). This is just first issue, if this was the only issue I could overlook it but it's not.

The second problem is that, they way you fought at 10 hours of playtime, that's likely how you will play for the rest of the game, and it gets very, VERY predictable. What I mean by predictable is that each area you enter you will fight a bunch of mobs one group after the next till you get to the final room, where you will fight the boss. THIS CONCEPT IS FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, FROM START TO FINISH.

Interesting part of the gameplay that I didn't do much was that, you can play as any of your companions and they all have different attack abilities and patterns to the point where it gets overwhelming. Otherwise they are controlled by the games AI.

The gameplay is what killed it for me, it was extremely repetitive, it almost feels like someone tried to copy the concepts from an MMORPG and make a skeleton format for Single player, it's sad because I was really interested in the plot of the game.

Overall:
I'd only recommend this game if you are looking for an anime-type game that has an interesting story but be aware that you'll have to do a lot of repetitive fighting to get to the story. That being said, as a game I don't think its a good game, it probably would be better as an anime and from what I read there won't be an anime adaptation so don't expect one. If you're looking for an anime-type game that is visually pleasing and has a fun gameplay that is a little less repetitive and more engaging I'd recommend Scarlet Nexus, the plot isn't as good but it's more fun in my opinion.

Note: This is my first game in the ""Tales of"" series so I'm not familiar with how the series was before this one but I still think my opinion matters for anyone new looking to try and join the series.",1657768661,1657768661,False,2,0,0.512229025363922119,0,True,False,False

And by dlc, they mean microtransactions. You can buy 40 levels right off the bat. Yknow how in games like final fantasy 7 (the original one) you can hold up to 99 of each type of consumable? Not here, you can hold up to 15 if you dont buy the relief pack, which gives you the ability to hold 99 of each consumable. I played my 10 hours on unknown difficulty, which is a difficulty you dont unlock until youve started the game as it is a dlc collectible that they give you for free. Fights drag on forever until you Rinwell, and thats with the replica katana, and gun I got for free which were better then the first four craftable weapons. The enemies were bullet sponges, and they hit like freight trains, the minor enemies taking two shots to kill Alphen in the first fights, and sometimes one shot for Shionne, there is no good way to grab aggro from the enemies, and overall its just hard to crowd control, more then two enemies and it gets chaotic, and hard to control, look at the fight right after you meet Law for the first time. There are 4 there including Law, and you just have to survive, which is kinda hard, seeing as the two gunman could oneshot Alphen, who was level 12 at that time. Leveling sucks, this games sp system sucks, literally look at FFA12 The Zodiac Age, it used a similar system and hit it out of the park.

Next onto the characters. They are all flavorless so far, and I fear the worst that they wont grow over the story. Even dragon quest 11 had some character growth, and part of that was literally going back in time to save the worst party member, and Erik losing his memory. I liked Alphen better when he was just Iron Mask, but only because I put the cat ears and the baki doll (another free ""dlc"") on his head, and it looked goofy in cutscenes. Also because I didnt have to see the horrid mouth movements when they talk. None of the words match up to what their mouths are doing. They just open and close their mouths constantly, and dont get me started on the campsite scenes, one before Zephyr was caught literally broke. Alphens mouth was moving when Zephyr was talking, even RINWELL'S mouth was moving when he was talking. Sometimes their mouths wouldnt move, it was overall just a shit a experience when they had to talk, so I just ended up skipping all the cutscenes, and I was streaming the game. I streamed all 10 hours of it, and I voiced my opinion on stream, and even read a few of the negative reviews out loud. For a studio that brought up Elden Ring, I am upset, and my day is ruined. I want my money back. $60 dollars is way too much for a shit title like this, and the only good quality is the graphics and the menus look nice, which is obviously where all the money went during production.

Finally, the areas, while I enjoyed walking through them, dungeons were boring, and packed full of enemies, I feel the game couldve used the system of random encounters, and did it better, but knowing this game, they would be constant and annoying wastes of time, resources, and my sanity. Also the gels, how hard is it for a gel to restore a percentage of health, instead of a set amount? So they remain useful throughout the entire game, and you have insentive to buy and stock up all the types of gel.

It's not apparent at first, but it's pretty telling when the developers ran out of gas and had to push their bus to the final station as soon as possible. I don't want to focus on the positives for this game, because other people have already told it better than me. I'm just going to say the negatives.

As said before, the content in this game spikes exponentially upward in the beginning, but by the endgame it's just bits and crumbs of cut contents sewed together in something that resembled endgame contents. Individually, those contents are not bad on their own, but when viewed on their own they are either unfinished or hastily finished.

The plot also suffers from this. In retrospect, this is similar with Tales of Vesperia but the complete opposite of Berseria. While Berseria has little to no content on its early game, it opens up in its midgame and endgame on optional content you could do. Vesperia, however, has sufficient content going at the end, but it paled in comparison to the quality it had at the beginning. What made Arise's endgame content absolutely enjoyable, however, was how much fanservice it had to the previous games in the Tales series. Yet the point still stands that it needs more endgame content.

The asking price for the game is not worth it, and this is from someone who have bought the Ultimate Edition. Get this game when it's on a 50% sale at minimum. Never less than that. Also, the DLCs are borderline scams. Get them if they're less than 10$. Especially the SAO DLC.

Even then, I can with good conscience give this game a good score and I would recommend it to my friends. If Bandai Namco could learn from this and design a better Tales going forward, I would gladly give my money to them.",1657759686,1657759686,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

I went into this series without knowing much about it other than hearing that the story was pretty good with decent combat. If combats your thing, I highly recommend you looking at a few videos explaining how it works. Once you get the hang of it, you start figuring out your own combos. Music was okay I guess. The first opening was ehhhh at best, but the second opening was really well done. The OST wasn't really good or bad, but it was acceptable at what it gave. People say that the story was weak or the plots predictable, but I think it was executed well. However what this game made me like about it so much was the little interactions they have. The little banters, the little flirting I LOVE THAT. And the game was rich of it. So full of it. There was alot of customization that you can unlock without paying a penny which means that you can force characters to have cat/dog ears which was pretty funny to me.

Love the graphic and soundtracks are good too.
However, the story is kinda trivial and the characters development is not so interesting. Most characters' dialogues are boring and the things they do in the game just don't make much sense. The maps are a bit repetitive but the exploration in the game is not so bad.
The battle mechanic is the real interesting (and irritating) thing. The way you play give the mix vibes of FF7R, Genshin, P5Striker. The part where they remove the mana mechanic give you a pretty new experience until you find yourself stuck with limited healing point instead.
Another bad points are the camera view and all the effect of characters' skills on the field give you a headache and disrupting you from doing proper action. 
I played in Challenge mode at first and has to switched to normal because boss fight is just a pain. Boss are literally a tank with bulk HP that take so long to stall down and hit you as hard as a cannonball. Without grinding and running back and forth, you wont have enough money to buy healing items for boss fight and upgrade everything.

The story has something to it but it never really hits a home run. Overall the gameplay gets a little old and boring pretty fast, and the combat, just like the story, has something there but just doesn't quite deliver enough to make it memorable.

At times combat could be mind numbing to the point of frustration - you have a dodge but if you take any damage you get momentarily stun locked, or in most cases when an enemy casts a spell, you get stun locked for the entire length of the spell... sometimes this can be 5+ seconds, it's exactly like getting juggled in a fighting game.

The companion AI is also very annoying at times. There will be a big telegraphed boss AOE attack and you'll turn the camera just to see your companions not moving and instead taking the full brunt of the attack. 

Additionally, many times a fight will begin and your companions will attack random enemies rather than focus on your primary target, and don't get me started on trying to effectively switch targets... I feel this game would have benfitted from a combat system closer to Genshin Impact where you can switch out between characters instantly. I often wanted to use a companion's capabilities to prevent an enemy from casting or to deflect damage but it's just not possible, so you'll end up just sitting there watching the enemy do their build up and being unable to do anything about it.

There is also no real difficulty to the game, at higher difficulties the enemies are simply bullet sponges (sword sponges i guess...) so the tedium grows at a very high pace if you play on anything like normal and above. I found myself knocking it down to easy for the last 5 hours just to get through another repetitive dungeon to get to the final boss.

In many ways this is kind of a remake of Final Fantasy X with Final Fantasy XV's combat; storywise there's a lot of comparisons to be made except that it's a slightly more young adult anime. 

If it's on sale, and you're super curious, and there's nothing else that takes your fancy right now, then I think it's a decent buy (these are the reasons I purchased it), but don't expect to be blown away by it.

This is my first Tales of game and it didn't really make me interested in checking any of the others out.

the art/sound direction and execution is excellent, as is the music, the combat feels (mostly) fluid, and the story is worth getting invested in

however, there are some questionable design decisions. for example, there is no indication as to what level a given quest or area is supposed to be tackled at and given that you cannot run from big encounters i had to quit to the menu well more than once because i was trapped in a battle that i could not win purely because of the levelling curve. this issue is compounded by the fact that you receive some quests well out of order from where youre intended to tackle them compared to where you are now.

another fact that i found somewhat irritating, but not to the point that it detracted from my experience is that the combat system heavily incenitivises long combos, but sometimes your combo just drops and i could never really figure out what causes a combo to drop. 

in total though i spent 61h in this game spread over around 10 days where i was capable of holding a controller, so whatever gripes i had with the game clearly werent enough to stop me from thoroughly enjoying it. if one is at all warm to JRPGs, i would recommend giving the demo and the game a shot.",1657373205,1657373205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise seemed like it would be one of the better ones and I heard very positive reviews so I was deeply disappointed by how flawed this game was. 

The Issues:

1. The Characters: The party just felt hollow without any standout hits. No funny or adorable character or anyone that feels relatable or profound. The party interaction never felt interesting and the romance seemed to have no justification for why it existed. So much of the past incredible games have been boosted by the dynamic cast that this lacked. The bad guys were mostly pathetic as characters. They are all deranged buffoons and the game constantly pushes how cartoonishly evil they all are.

2. The Story: The story felt like it was supposed to be very dark and heart-renching but a lot of it just felt absurd and melodramatic. For example there is a scene where a party member and loving leader figure out apparently millions of his people were murdered. It is supposed to be shocking but it just came across as silly, I mean the guy didn't notice this happening 5 feet away? The city seems to only have thousands of people but apparently millions of them were killed and no one thought to mention it? It was hard to take a lot of the story seriously. It was a far cry from Symphonia's genuinely profound and heartbreaking story.

3. The Combat: It is just unbelievably slow. Far more so than any other Tales game, your allies do miniscule damage and every random encounter has enemies with way too much health. For me combat was just repeating my highest damage move over and over to lessen the time it took get through a fight.

I was really excited for this game and was sad it was not the experience I hoped for, I wish I could give it a positive review.

Review Below

combat is pretty fluid but nothing to write home about and they do re-skin a lot of enemy's throughout the game.  This is a story based game though so I feel it should be judged primarily on that. 

So the story itself is also pretty average.  It's best at the beginning and the end but the story is slow during the middle and there are also definitely times were I feel like these characters have one trait and that's their entire character, if you've ever watched ""black clover"" or ""my hero academia"" you'll know what I mean.  As for the ending it was pretty good, my only complaints would be that the final boss was not very intimidating compared to the mobs guarding him, and we never do find out how all of this got started although you can bet it was probably some scientist somewhere messing with astrial energy. 

Conclusion: this game is rite in the middle for me, but compared to the two other JRPG's I have played this was the best.",1657252502,1657252502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't totally agree with the other artes being locked behind paywall though and it's kinda frustrating to know that you can't obtain those skills via playthrough. 

The difficulty spike in this game kinda caught me off guard since it's nothing like the previous tales games where everybody are just being rewarded with a **** ton of gald and items that even if you buy max stack of items from shops you still have money to spare. 

The DLC artifacts are basically easy mode for anyone who wishes to use them. And people who suck at the game will still suck at the game even with the DLCs enabled since the game is just spoonfeeding you at this point. 

All the rants about the game being hard without the DLC artifacts and items is like complaining why the souls games are hard (It's stupid). I know it's frustrating at first and trust me, it is for me too. I died a lot and I felt like I'm playing a souls anime game.",1631234966,1657251818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Theme feels inconsistent; they clearly want a ""more mature"" vibe, but it frequently, awkwardly, goes back to the anime tropes like having the main female lead suddenly flustered out of character?
- ...And the anime feeling was GOOD for Tales Of. The character designs here simply lack the charm, bright colors, personality, and memorability of past Tales Of titles.
- The story thus far is extremely generic? I'm assuming there must be a twist somewhere, right? So far it's just going around freeing nations from super-evil tyrant sorts. Who I guess are from outerspace (not a spoiler--see the next point)
- Huge exposition dump at the start of the game. Usually I'm a defender of exposition in media. But... none of it even felt needed here. If they just didn't have the opening cinematic that dropped tons of exposition, the game's story would feel more immersive and interesting. I don't need to be told how evil the obviously evil tyrant ""of fire"" (actual title) is or how badly the slaves are treated if you then immediately show me slaves being beaten.
- It's not actually open world, there's just no overworld map it seems. (Past Tales Of games had big explorable areas that you go to via walking around an overworld map). I'm hoping it opens up more because thus far this makes the game world feel smaller, not bigger.
- Much smaller criticism, but characters have very strange, modern-feeling dialogue with sayings that sound very out of place for the world setting like ""kicked the bucket,"" ""burst your bubble,"" and ""crystal clear"" ect ect. These work in games like FF7 but feel awkward with this world so far.

So. It's Tales Of, and therefore good and worth playing if you like action JRPGs. But I don't think it's going to dethrone whichever past Tales Of game is your favorite.",1657246020,1657246597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, that is not normal. Normally the game recognises that you are using keyboard and mouse and explains the gamepad layout in the tutorial...

So that's a positive thing...
On the negative side, Bandai still doesn't give a shit what the customers want or what is standard on the PC.

You first have to search the forum to find out that you have to exit the game via TAB. You don't get the chance to leave the game via ESC or the normal menu.....
i.e. the first praise is almost invalid because if you have to search for standard assignments in the forum first...

Story: 7/10 *
Character development: 9/10 *
Graphics: 7/10
Combat: 7/10 **
Gameplay: 8/10
Crafting and Inventory management: 7/10

*Story and Character development have been knocked down by one point each because the ""skits"" through which most of them are delivered are too numerous, too long, and not well timed. There are many points where, for no particular reason, you are faced with many minutes of inter-party dialog, much of which is banal. 

On the up side, after the final battle you are allowed to go back into the world and finish up anything left undone (e.g., side quests). World exploration has enough fast travel to make navigation reasonable.

** Combat could have been 9/10. It probably is for players who play mainly for the combat, and have fast reactions. It also is for players who do not care about combat at all, as the combat AI is excellent, so on Story and Very Easy modes you can pretty much just sit back and watch. However, for folks in between, the action is so fast that, with as many as a dozen combatants in play, all running concurrently in real time, it's almost impossible to understand what's happening, and learn  from it. And unfortunately, there is no way to adjust combat speed.

Combat: The combat is, in my opinion, the best in the series and a massive barrier breaker for getting new people into the series. The previous titles had cumbersome combat that was much more difficult to pick up at least for me. Each character has something fun to offer but you can just as easily play the whole game as the flagship swordsman.

Graphics and Performance: This is another area that has improved. It is nothing jawdropping, but does great for the game that it is. Character models look stunning and the faces are much more expressive. I had no issues running this game on my 2060. 

Characters: While I personally liked the cast of Berseria more, the cast for this game I found to be fun, engaging, and well voice-acted. They are all introduced and added to the party at a good pace and everyone contributes to the overall theme in someway. To get the most out of their character development, I recommend doing the sidequests.

UI: Never once was I lost or confused when finding anything in this game. While this praise may seem strange, this series is notorious for having hidden or missable quests that you can only know of if you are the kind of person to do way to many playthroughs of a game or looking at a guide. Anytime a new sidequest is available, you can see it as a white envelope in the fast travel menu. It would be nice if these missions told you the recommended level before I waltzed into a fight 20 levels higher than me but you can not have everything.

While I still recommend this game, I feel I must address the negatives I had even as a fan of the series.

Villains: Oh boy I have no clue how they messed this one up. The series has had so many cool and compelling villains yet this game misses the mark so bad by denying them any and all development and killing them off before they form any meaning against the protagonists. By the time I was hearing the final villain give his speech right before the final fight, all I could respond was with a careless ""Ight"". The design of all the villains and their accompanied voice-acting was great, but not enough to be as memorable as villains in the past.

Story: I wanted to like the story so bad and I do not want to say it is so bad to scare away those who are interested, but I am so unsure what the plan was. The premise was interesting enough but towards the endgame I was hit with all of these plot revelations that felt hollow for some reason. Thankfully as is tradition with the series, the characters and their developing relationships are what carry you through the story.

Overall I still recommend this game and really appreciate the multiple leaps forward this installment has made for the series. It is far more accessible to newcomers without hurting its identity too much. While the things I disliked are unfortunate, it did not hurt my experience too much and I hope the developers of the next game learn from it.",1657003540,1657003540,True,2,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,False

Story 8/10

I loved the story all the way up until one of the areas near the end of the game. I think those who have already played will understand what I'm talking about. The place felt like a massive info dump and more rushed compared to other moments in the game. Because this story dense area should've been the strongest moment in the story and the mark was missed, it docked an extra point from the score. The story is great, but sometimes the game struggles to tell it.

Music 9/10

I enjoyed all of the music in the game. Some of the tracks felt a bit similar to each other, especially during a couple of endgame areas. That didn't mean they were bad experiences or annoying, but just not as stand out as many of the earlier tracks.

Combat 9/10

I enjoyed the combat a lot. It looks absolutely gorgeous, and with cut scene finishes for enemies, it's never been more satisfying to cut down an enemy, even one of the little ones. There are quite a few characters to play as with quite different play styles. Those characters also have different focuses within those play styles. Unlocking skills is also quite expansive and rewarding as well. You can build your set of skills for whatever combinations suit you best. The equipment is a lot more basic. When it comes to armor and weapons, you pretty much just forge the best set you've unlocked every once in a while and you'll be fine. Buying CP restoring items is a must. When it comes to accessories it's a little bit more complex, but I never felt a huge need to max out my damage or much else. Of course, I only played on normal mode, so I can't say I've experienced the harder difficulties.

Characters 10/10

Loved all the characters. I usually base this off of how hard it is for me to rank my favorite characters from the game after I've finished it, and this time it was extremely hard for me. All of them are unique and charming in their own ways, and I'm going to miss them. The skits and campfire moments have made me fall in love with each character, and I think this game did a great job at fleshing them out.

Visuals 10/10

The game is always gorgeous. The scenery, the character models, your skills in battle, and every cut scene including the few 2D ones all pop with their own magnificent style. I was left in awe many times throughout my journey. There are many times where I simply didn't want to leave an area because I was having such a good time looking around and exploring. I did have a few times where the frame rate would struggle, but the magical visuals were well worth it in my opinion.

Overall Rating 9.2/10

After averaging all the scores together, I got a 9.2/10. I'm not exactly the harshest critic on the block, but this game really spoke to me. There were very few times where I wasn't having a blast. I absolutely loved this game and it's a shame that I'm done with it.

The graphics are pleasing, the music draws me in, and the combat animations are pretty cool. I think the story is kind of meh, typical protag kinda character. Everyone has a dark past, so no real impact there either. It isn't quite tropey on the characters, but it almost does make it there. Shionne specifically is your typical tsundere. Do I like her? Well yeah but thats my personal preference. I also feel like the characters need some better development, but i'm only in the snow area right now so take that for what its worth. Anyway, everything else is pretty good, but the combat needed some refinement to be sure. The system is not fun, spongey enemies take the fun out of fighting when your damage doesnt increase enough to even warrant such growth in hp. Also, the whole ""battle arena"" every time you run into an enemy kind of kills the immersion for me. Not having my companions at my side consistently kind of makes it feel shallow until scenes come up where everyone is there. But i feel like that was also why they made a battle system with a battle arena to begin with. Also, im only level 13, I have 1k hp and already fought a boss that had 30k hp...whats up with that? spongey bosses with unimaginative mechanics are kind of meh for me being an elden ring veteran. In my opinion, giving bosses more hp doesn't generate ""real"" difficulty only ""artificial."" Anyway TLDR ; I rate this title about 4/10. This is heavily from the spongey enemy combat and the lackluster story and characters that go with it. I've played better games, and honestly I dont think im determined enough to finish this game. I also don't understand the fanboying over this game. There are way better JRPGs out there, and this isn't one of them.",1656833063,1656985016,False,5,0,0.525265991687774658,0,True,False,False

First off, the art style of this game is amazing. Watercolors galore and the game never lets up that aesthetic. Looks amazing. The characters were also done really well despite the tricky art style and look amazing as well. Next are the characters. They have tons of story that integrates well with each other and they all build on each other well. You see them grow and become something amazing and watching them grow their bond is just the cherry on top. Story-wise the game can get a little convoluted, but if you're devoting at least 75% of your brain to the story you'll get it. It's got twists and turns and so many unforgettable moments that are so powerful and emotional. The cast did an amazing performance and there are familiar voices such as Ray Chase (who you may know as Noctis from FF15) and Erica Lindbeck (who voices Futaba from Persona 5). The gameplay is really solid, as to be expected from this series. It uses a combo system using a mix between melee, magic, ranged, and weapon skills called artes. You can chain these artes and integrate them into your combos to deal massive damage and once you deal enough damage an enemy you start to fill up a break meter. Once this fills up you can finish off an enemy by teaming up with any fellow party member and doing a unique attack depending on who you choose to initiate the break with. Quests are plentiful and many of them very funny and memorable too. The message of the game is also a tough topic to handle, but is handled well and I really like what they did. One thing I must mention however. This game has the same comic strip type of cut-scene that Scarlet Nexus has, and there are hundreds of them. There's over 300 of them. You can always skip them and visit a campfire where you can rest, make food, talk with members of your party, and view any missed or skipped cut-scenes. The sad part is that sometimes there can be big nuggets of info in these cut-scenes so you don't wanna miss them. Overall, this game is amazing and I'm overjoyed that this won RPG of the year because it really deserved it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long game to sit down and enjoy and take in all the story and atmosphere that this game offers.",1639205341,1656785481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the fact that the devs say this is the ""future of the series"" makes me (a huge fan of this series prior to arise) never want to buy a Tales Of game again, ever. No matter how many shiny stickers and ""awards"" a bunch of numpties who wouldn't know a good plot if it slapped them upside the face give it.

The long story, however, I'm glad to share. But be warned that bad games don't get spoiler protection.
Prior to this game's launch I was really looking forward to it, as it had been years since a previous game in the series. But just before release I had a lot of... hesitations. Heard about the DLC menu in camps, the artstyle change, the god-awful new skits being borrowed from scarlet nexus, and everything. But I naively assumed it was just a quirk of the demo and the full game would be like the older games in the series. I was wrong.
The story starts off very strong, and the game also has great graphics, even on the lowest settings. I won't lie, I was enjoying myself for the first world of the game, with my only complaints being the shitty DLC in camp menu thing. The characters had some mystery to them and I couldn't wait to see them develop further, especially since Iron Mask remembered his name and all that. But the game kept going... and going... and going... and nobody really developed. The only character with any real depth to them by the time I was halfway through chapter 2 was Rinwell, and Law was still going through his arc too but as soon as ch 2 was over he stopped developing and became a flat brawler look-on-the-bright-side character with no real nuance to him. Shionne was a bitch and Alphen... fuck I don't remember shit about Alphen other than generic protagonist dude, being immune to pain, and liking lots of spice on his food. Spy bit with the rebels was interesting but we didn't get any time at all to develop it and just blazed through it when in any other tales game we would've spent a few hours getting to know this faction at least. Law gets some good stuff here but this is all he gets the whole story... but at least we got the most interesting form of Indignation in the series. 
Story continues and CH 3 actually introduced some interesting characters, including the future party members of Kisara and Dohalim. Dohalim is someone I'd like to elaborate on a bit, as he's the only character on par with other characters in the series... he actually has depth... he actually gets character development and overcomes his troubles as the story progresses.. he learns to open up at a reasonable and believable pace, and he ends up uniting his race and the dahnans near the end of the story... only for the game to pull that accomplishment out from under him and go LOLOLOL NANOMACHINES SON YOU WERE SAME THE WHOLE TIME YOUR SPEECH WAS MEANINGLESS... *sigh*... at least he's easily the most fun character in the game in combat, too. As for Kisara, she's nice for fanservice I guess and has neat gameplay, AI can't play her for shit tho thus she's a liability to have in combat unless you're playing her. The only issue I have with CH 3 and dohalim in general is excess flashbacks without something to prompt them. The first flashback at dinner was really unnecessary and should either be removed or have something to prompt it, like Dohalim playing his violin before the meal or something. Also this chapter suffers the most from the stupid fast plot pace. Things barely feel developed and you don't really get a good sense of everything.
After this it's just downhill from here. The game starts introducing enemies that your AI buddies refuse to dodge (like the giant iguanas) and other shit to make you miserable. Rinwell's arc gets ruined here for a ""revenge bad"" bit of BS (when she didn't even eat that cursed fruit, not even in Dohalim's domain, so she wouldn't have melted like the rest if she actually did kill the wind lord then and there). Everyone besides Dohalim stops developing and shionne continues to be all tsun no dere even after being rescued. The game does finally recover slightly on the space station but then nosedives with the ending arc, stupid twist of Rena being a dead apple core planet that makes no astrophysical sense, and the final dungeon being a gauntlet of the worst enemies the game can throw at you, several making the AI braindead just to make you drain more healing resources. I finally gave up on this piece of shit halfway through the final dungeon, just can't finish it.

I could spend days writing an hour-long or several-page essay on how shitty and awful this game is. But I won't. Just know its shit and a waste of your money, especially if you liked the prior games in the Tales series. Don't let the awards fool you as they're solely earned through mass appeal in this case, rather than actual good story. 
The only good things about this game are Dohalim, Kisara, and the OST... and you can just look up fanart of the first two and find the third on youtube.

The built in time mechanics to a single player offline game is pissing me off more and more now that I've 100%'d the game. I finished this game over 15 hours ago, but because of the ridiculous ""bonding"" mechanic only being able to activate once every hour and you need to do this 4-5 times PER character, means my game time in game is slowly going more and more up, DESPITE THE FACT I'M NOT PLAYING if I want to ""platinum"" the game, despite the fact mechanically I've done everything else!

It's gorgeous, it can be fun, but the bosses nearer the end are not enjoyable due to AI mechanics. The AI of the companions is possibly the worst I've ever experienced and some of the achievements at the end are hard locked behind time constraints to buff your play time.

I will add, that I enjoyed my time with this game, as an RPG, but it has some glaring horrendous issues. 
The positives of the game is that it is a bit of fun. I played the majority of this game on moderate because I'm not insane, the game is very hard on higher difficulties, with the reason becoming clear later in my review. 
I learnt enemy attack patterns, I got better armour, weapons, items and fought stronger enemies. This works for about 60-70% of the game. 

Then the flaws arose... the AI in this game. 
The bosses obviously get harder. They have bigger and stronger attacks. Large attacks that can be dodged with ease and then smaller attacks that require you to learn the telegraphs and not button spam and cancel out of your current attacks at the earliest convenience. They are quite well telegraphed and as the controlled character, you can fight these battles with great satisfaction as you learn more and more.
What you can't do is rely on the AI to do the same. The AI will walk into or just stand still in some of the BIGGEST and most telegraphed attacks in the game without ever attempting to move out of the way or dodge. The issue is at any given level you are meant to be at, these are all one shot mechanics. My entire team apart from me is now dead in almost all of these scenarios.

I have seen people try and defend this aspect of the game with ""turn off long cast artes and use the gambit system to program them""... this is an AWFUL defense of this AI, which will then walk in and try and normal attack despite the fact they are casters. Turning off long cast artes helps, but they still do this. The Gambit system, I have seen compared to FFXII's... This is an insult to the insanely detailed Gambit work you can do in FFXII given any scenario. This game gives you the most basic system imaginable and you can't turn off half the stuff the AI does which would extend their life.

The scale of difficulty in this game is purely derived from your AWFUL teammates. Learning the enemy attack patterns and becoming proficient yourself is USELESS when you are having to continuously revive 3 team members who walk into the most telegraphed attacks that are all One shots. 
Once I figured out this games difficulty spike is purely derived from this, the game is unbearable to play. I put the difficulty down to the minimum and rushed to the end. 

There is no enjoyment, in perfectly learning a bosses attack patterns, dodging everything with well timed precision, just to watch your other 3 teammates die in ridiculous manners.

If the game handled the AI better, I could see myself giving this game an 8 like I've seen many ""game critics"" do. However, these people clearly either played the game on the easiest difficulty from the beginning, or just never reached these sections or analysed the gameplay mechanics of this game before they awarded such a score.

Do not get me wrong, is a bit of fun, looks good, but even the environments and the 12 types of enemies in a 30 hour game get very old very fast. This game FEELS cheap.

Overall, this is an alright game and I don't regret purchasing it. I just wouldn't recommend anyone else does the same unless they have spare change and have tried all other good RPGs.",1656625505,1656631196,False,4,0,0.510061264038085938,0,True,False,False

The fighting system it's not my favourite, but still, I have to say, really good: they managed to make all characters accessible in battle in a pretty organic way. 

There is some downside if we want to split hairs, the game is clearly thought for console and that is clear if you look at certain combination of keys in the battle. Every time you want to quit the game you can't simply press ESC, accessing the menu and select an option from there, but actually need to open another menu that pratically serves the only purpose of going back to title.
Story wise I liked it, but spent most of the final stages of storyplay listening to long discussions where the characters took ages to realise things that were pretty obvious from other recent discussions; the dialogues were crammed together at the start of the area, so I spent most or the time pressing CTRL to trigger said dialogues. The ending wasn't bad, but could have been realised way better given how the rest was made, left me a bit unsatisfied and with the sensation that production was rushed at the end like happens in many cases.

I did try symphonia and beseria but i dropped them because i wanted to play other things at the time, but i did enjoy what i played of both. And i thought the game was great overall but the story and characters were lacking a little.

So to start of with the combat. It was fantastic and one of the most fun jrpg combat systems that i have used. I love the combo system this game has and all the moves you can use feel really satisfying to combo into each other. It all just felt really smooth to use and i was very impressed. The combat is the main reason i think this game is great but that isn´t to say that it doesn´t have problems that i think the next game should adress. The enemy veriaty isn´t the greatest, there are maybe 15 enemy types that get reskinned over and over which is dissapointing. I think the enemies are well designed overall but there are just too few of them. I also think some enemies and bosses have a little too much health, they can kinda drag out a little too long. I think the bosses are well designed in their mechanics and very fun to fight but are just slightly too long. It can get kinda repititive also but it isn´t that big of a problem. So, like i said the combat is amazing it just needs a few tweaks here and there to make it my favorite combat in a game. 

The Voice acting is fantastic in this game, some of the best i have heard. I was impressed by basically everybody but especially Ray Chase as Alphen, he was incredibly good. And i also want to mention the music which i thought was alright, there were some good tracks but most of it was kinda forgettable imo. 

The story was enjoyable i guess but it just feels lazily put together with a lot of unexplained things and not that many satisfying moments. But the biggest problem with this story is how the villains are handeled. They are all just really evil with basically no depth what so ever but that could be fine for some of the villains i guess but the problem is that every villain is poorly developed and are basically just evil just for the sake of being evil. The main villain is one of the worst i have seen and they try to give a reason for why its doing what its doing but that´s right before the final boss so by that point it´s already too late and i didn´t care at all. There were some good twists i guess but this villain problem is such a big problem that it brings down the stoy a lot, especially when the game starts questioning if killing these villains is even right but at the same time the villains literally have killed thousands and act like the most evil people in history, kinda ruins that whole part of the story. And i also think the game mishandled the final area, i was excited to explore this location the entire game but it just ends up being a long dungeon with a bunch of enemies to fight and very little story. 

And then we get to the characters. I don´t think the main characters are bad (except for maybe Law) but they definitely feel underdeveloped despite how much they talk with each other. I think Alphen and Shionne are the exceptions though and i liked them both quite a bit. The relationship those two had i also thought was very well done and shows that these writers can write interesting characters that develop interesting relationships with others but it´s only those two. The other ones just feels so basic. The game just seems to think that if the characters have a lot of dialogue they are suddenly deep but a lot of that dialogue in this game is just the characters reapeting the same information over and over and over again. It also doesn´t help that about 90% of the skits are either repeat infomation from what was already stated in the main story or just don´t add anything at all to the characters. I was surprised how little the skits in this game actually added to the characters, i don´t know why i even listened to so many as i did, it just felt like a waste of time. 

So overall, as a gameplay experience i loved this game a lot and it´s one of the best jrpg gameplay experiences i have ever had. At the same time though i only thought the characters and story was ok. I think game is still great however, that´s how good i thought the gameplay actually was, saves the entire game.",1656524456,1656524652,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]Music and Sound of the world[/b]
[list]
[*]They're excellent. The music fits the settings, locations, fights, and world just perfectly. This is one of the strongest aspects of this game.
[/list]

[b]Graphics and World Building Design[/b]
[list]
[*]Maps look gorgeous and have a distinctive feel, but they're confusing to navigate; once you unlock a checkpoint, you will be teleporting back and forward unless the game decides nah, you cant teleport now because the story is too important to even tho you can run all the way to the very beginning of the game.
[*]Do you enjoy running from wall to wall? If not, you won't be able to 100% the game. Also, the pattern of each zone is quite similar. It's either a big open field with a drop or two or one time use your magic power to do an action or a dungeon/city with a linear path where you run from a room to a room fighting the same three types of monster over and over again, or you are running from NPC to NPC
[*]Why does this game lack a world map? I do not understand why they haven't put the time to create a nice world map art to show how big each realm/ country is. This takes from the immersion. Rather than feeling like you are running through a section of a more significant place, everything feels close together and small despite the locations being quite big and having massive structures in the background. This kills the enjoyment of the game. You constantly click two buttons to swap between levels of one map because you can't see the whole zone map at once. It's an annoying and stupid design. 
[*]The overall worldbuilding is done quite well through the environmental design. Each zone is modelled after a different type of element, so you will see gorgeous savannas, deserts, winter lands, forests, green pastures etc. What annoyed me so far is that they sold the game as using this new type of day/night cycle shadow system, but there's no weather change like rain or sandstorm, which could add to the zones if they were more random occurrences. They could boost or debuff certain elemental attunements.
[*]The Zones are quite static, except of a few occasions where you use mana/cp. The maps are static. I would love to see changes in the terrain like opening new paths or changing water levels due to weather that allows you to reach new places or force you to take an alternative route/ approach. This would give a bit more individuality to each run. It's not necessary, but it would definitely be added to the experience.
[*] The main find me I will give you costume objective is owls. If you played previous games, you would remember finding Katz. This is one of the worse aspects of the game. The owls aren't hard to find, and their home is a boring place where you only go to receive more costume items. I prefer Katz Korner, which was full of charm and fun little things. I'm bringing this up because this is the main problem of this game. There are too many soulless elements put there for the gamer not to enhance or be part of the world. Basically, it is game logic, oh, we are in these ancient abandoned ruins, yet the torches are brightly burning. 
[/list]

[b]Difficulty, Fighting and Monster/Boss Fights[/b]
[list]
[*]The fighting is fine. Its tales a style of fighting that has been used for the past few games. If you played Tales of Zestira of Bestaria and enjoyed the fighting, you will find this a slightly improved and more fluid and fun fighting system.
[*]The monsters are annoying. Some just damage sponges that take a hot minute to kill while they don't do anything more. 
[*]Most boss fights are quite simple, especially in the early game. They get progressively harder but usually stay quite fair. Except for this one fight in 3rd realm. The game introduced a new mechanic of stopping charging enemies. The problem is that the mechanic has a time precast which means if you are too close to the boss, you miss stopping him because the stop effect spawns behind the boss. This fight is a sudden spike in difficulty and is quite buggy. I died so so many times from stupid charge stoping animation spawning behind the boss... I was forced to restart to my previous save grind for money and a few levels before stocking up on mana restores and life bottle to beat the bastard on normal difficulty. I can't imagine how hard he can be on higher difficulty.
[*]Also, I had a bug where after a few minutes of fighting one mini dragon boss, the NPCs stopped. They stopped moving, attacking, healing, reviving, dodging. They just stood and died one by one. I was forced to quickly swap between each character, use one or two skills, and quickly swap to another until I killed the stupid mini-boss.
[*]The fighting animations will make you die if you play Law, a melee fighting character. The amount of visual noise and special effects are so annoying. There are times when you will need to dodge back because you can't see what is going on.
[/list]

[b]Story and Side Stories (might include slight spoilers)[/b]
[list]
[*]The story is shallow, with interesting concepts, but the pacing is too fast. So far, I'm just into 4th realm/country. Every story arc revolves around one flavour of the concept of occupation vs freedom and what it means to be free. [spoiler]Do you want to overturn a power-hungry dictator as a slave? Do you want to see a dictator who controls with red fear? Do you want a ruler who establishes equality? etc.[/spoiler] You will see all of those, but none will be adequately explored. It is like smelling and seeing a delicious meal but once eaten, it was meh.
[*]The main main story is unaddressed for 2.5 whole chapters. What is the deal with our main male MC, and what is the story with our main female MC. I know they both are going to be addressed, but in 24h of the game, their relationship and individual characters didn't grow or change much. 
[*]The coolest fight story scenes are in the engine cinematic. As an example, our main character is kicked through the wall, but why didn't the game force me to play this specific character and see in-game being kicked through the wall? And that triggers the cinematic, not the random boss hp. This happens so often that it is just annoying.
[*]The side stories are boring. There is like one recurring character that is boring and forgettable, and he just gives you a recipe for a new dish every time. The usally are 3 types of missions in the game. 1. Go kill that thing/ group of things, 2. Go bring me those cooking materials, or 3. Go there, kill that thing and bring me the monster materials.
[*]There's a lack of fun or memorable characters or antagonists. All of the villains so far in the game are one-note characters. Hur Dur I'm muscle man I want power, Hur Dur I'm a manipulative man I want to control everyone, Hur Dur I'm a good guy, but my underling is evil/ I'm evil, and my underling is good.
[*]Overall, I believe the game would be better off having a smaller world, but the maps physically change or transform with the story rather than having way too many characters and special gimmicks that don't enhance the story. Or the having less distinctive realms/countries but expanding each realm after beating the main story. Like a new map or two, which are optional, with an additional story that shows the progression of the realm after our main story.

I've always leaned towards giant mmo-rpgs with multiplayer functionality. I love customization and I love being rewarded for my efforts which doesn't really happen too much in games like these. I will buy games on here all the time that are marked down just to have them collect dust in my library and never touch them again. This game is soooo different you need to give it a try, especially at its marked down price. There is a demo, but honestly it does the game no justice. The demo starts you off end game with your whole squad of characters unlocked really giving you no substance of what the game is really about. The demo will make you feel confused about the combat system but trust me, the main game does a wonderful job building your knowledge up from beginning to end. I'm so happy with this combat system because its almost impossible to get stale. You will unlock hundreds of new attacks you can swap into your kit on top of that swap your main playable character with any of the others following you around. The tag team combos and animations that follow with it just makes the combat that more satisfying. This is also not a button mash and pass game. While at the beginning button mashing abilities may work, but certain monsters/bosses you run into later in the game will need certain characters abilities used in order to clear them out, not doing so could be fatal. You need to have a game plan and there's an aspect of you getting familiar with the things you are fighting and how to most effectively defeat them. There are monsters routed along the map you can choose to run into and fight or you can dodge them and obtain whatever item they are more than likely sitting in front of. I would normally choose to avoid fights like these in most games but I dive into every single one here, its just too much fun. You are rewarded heavily for sweeping maps of their hidden items and for defeating mobs (which drop items of their own). The game features a crafting system where you can create items in return for the items you pocketed sweeping the map or by killing mobs. The value of time is definitely there and its 100% worth it. Along with exploring the map there are hidden owls that you can seek out that hold special items you can equip to your party members. For example I've gotten wolf ears, sun glasses, cat tail, etc all types of things you'd want to have in a type of game like this. The story of the game isn't bad either. I'm big on anime but have never heard or played a Tales game before this. While cheesy here and there (these things are expected in most anime) it does its job really well and I look forward to finding out what comes next. The game is almost like you are watching an anime yourself with cut scenes that are actually animated like a show to almost manga like panels being darted across your screen (IN 3D I SHOULD ADD) giving you backstory between your character and your party members. It really makes you develop feelings for these characters and makes you feel invested ultimately. The story the gameplay the art style the voice acting all A+. If you could manage the game subbed I would highly recommend for just that extra oompff of satisfaction but the English voice acting was done properly. PC controls may be a bit odd for some people, I more so enjoyed myself plugging in a controller which was no big deal at all because I do feel like its a game where I can kick back and enjoy. I do not regret the cash I downed for this as I know I will be eagerly awaiting the next time I boot the game up. 7/8 hours in and I'm not even halfway through the game (THERES TONS OF SIDE QUESTS THAT REWARD YOU GREATLY). While the game takes a little getting to know its so worth it in the end, it does such a great job of pushing you forward with its training wheels that you forget that they are even there.",1656438600,1656455525,True,4,0,0.527674198150634766,0,True,False,False

Tales of arise is, unfortunately, even worse. It's not a bad game but worse than the other Tales of games. Graphics are a bit better but it's extremely linear, exploring isn't really fun, there is no world map (Berseria suffered from this, too) and the plot is so superficial.

In Tales of the Abyss the whole thing about cloning and not being able to handle loss felt kind of deep. The whole slavery and occupation angle in tales of arise just feels shallow and disingenious (is that how you spell it?). It's just a plot point, nothing more. Also no character development, just archetypes.  The main character in Tales of the Abyss had a great arc. The boy in the beginning is much different from the man at the end of the game. Tales of Arise is just this boring love story with no impact. Characters stay the same and a whole lot of anime crap like having to get stronger than everyone else and friendship and love saves the day. meh. I guess, all the cringey anime crap you usually get in these kinds of games was much more toned down in Tales of Berseria and Tales of the Abyss which is why it didn't make me want to hit my head against the wall every 30 minutes. 

Combat is fine but enemies have too much HP. I know it's about combos and stuff but in older Tales of games, fights were faster and more fun. It didn't feel like you do no damage, at all. Also, I know this is a personal preference but I like to grind in these kinds of games. You can forget about that in Tales of Arise. Once you reach the intended level for the area you almost gain no XP even with XP bonuses activated.

If you get it on sale for cheap, you can try it out but it's a really disappointing Tales of Game. If you've never played one of the series, go with Tales of the Abyss or Tales of Berseria instead. They're much more fun, have better characters, gameplay, plot and freedom.

There has been for long a rather cynical joke about modern video games being one long cutscene which is occasionally interrupted by short segments of gameplay. For some JRPGs this is actually quite literally true. While Tales of Arise might not be the worst example of this, it's still pretty up there. It's difficult to play the game for even five minutes without the gameplay being interrupted with yet another cutscene (unless you are eg. just engaging in repetitive level-grinding that doesn't advance towards the next goal). If I estimate there's about a thousand gameplay-interrupting cutscenes in the main quest alone I don't think I would even be exaggerating. And that's just the mandatory cutscenes. In addition there are some hundreds of optional cutscenes (triggered by a button at certain points in the story).

A story-heavy game does not need this many cutscenes, especially not ones that interrupt the gameplay, the flow of the game. It might just be a personal pet peeve of mine, but it becomes quite irritating when for the hundredth time I cannot run towards the next goal for even a minute before yet another cutscene interrupts it.

It would be slightly less annoying if the story was interesting. Which brings me to the next point: The story is very ""meh"". It's average, run-of-the-mill paint-by-the-numbers, with nothing extraordinarily unusual, interesting or engaging about it (although, to be honest, at the point of writing this review I have still not played the game through. It's possible the story will become more interesting later. However, in my experience if the story isn't interesting in the first half-hour to one hour of gameplay, it won't become interesting later. Exceptions to this are exceedingly rare.)

The graphics are quite ok for the style (ie. cell-shaded more-on-the-cartoony-side), even above average compared to other games using the same graphical style.

The combat mechanics are ok, I suppose (and quite varied). I personally prefer turn-based combat in JRPGs (the more classical, the better), but that's just a personal preference and I understand not all players prefer them.

But now, given the binary choice of ""yes"" and ""no"", with no ""meh"" option, what should I vote? While I'm far from enthusiastic about the game, I don't want to be unfair. If I compare it to *all* JRPGs that exist out there (or even just on Steam) I would say this is above average, so I suppose it has to be a ""yes"" then. I have played much, *much* worse JRPGs than this. This is not bad by any stretch. It's just not extraordinarily good either (at least in my personal opinion; your own experience may be vastly different).",1656243910,1656243910,True,1,0,0.475134819746017456,0,True,False,False

Combat is fun, characters are diverse, although I don't think all the characters are equally fun to play.It is fulfilling to learn the various mechanics and put them to use in real time. You can button mash and mindlessly use moves and do good enough, but strategically using your tools feels rewarding when you see how much faster you can dispatch the enemies in a game where they are particularly health-spongy.

My biggest gripe with the game is really the your computer controlled party members in battle. I never was really able to wrap my head around how to use 'Strategies' (the method in which you control AI behavior in battle). I really wanted my characters to keep away from enemies when their health was low to avoiding dying and using up precious revive resources, but never felt like that was really executed. 

Another small complaint: keeping track of enemy movements sometimes got too difficult behind all the grandiose (but very visually distracting) VFX of both ally and enemy moves. This gets particularly annoying in battles with 4 or 5 enemies, all throwing out a bunch of nonsense. 

There is a LOT of dialogue, all with pretty good voice acting (I played the game in English). It can get pretty cheesy, but all of the characters are endearing enough, even through their cliches. All of the larger themes are pretty heavy handed, but I don't think subtlety was really the goal with this one, lol.

I feel like Arise hits all the same issues that most JRPGs and many other RPGs are all seeming to have over the past few generations of gaming and namely it all comes down to writing. I personally think story and characters are more important than any other part of the RPG genre and it is sorely lacking here. The plot is weak and the storytelling of said plot is very poor. The characters are shallow and forgettable. The world seems empty and uninspired. 

I either did not care about the main characters or in some cases, actively hated them (Namely Law). I hate it when characters just continually act stupid for no reason and the game acts like it's perfectly normal for people to act in that way. All of the characters do this at some point, Law just did it the most and some of the stuff really stood out.

The world feel empty. People talk about the great graphics and all I can even say to that is WHERE? Most of the areas are boring, the dungeons almost all are just the same one or two room designs copy pasted. And they are mostly large, open area rooms with like one thing in a corner then you go to the next room. Many of the world areas were just flat to me style wise. The snow area and fire area were just mostly white and brown/red respectively. It didn't feel like they had any character. Compare this to the 25 year old Tales of Destiny. Each area looked like it was really worked on to give it it's own personality.

The plot. It feels like there was something that could have been interesting but the writing talent wasn't there to do it justice. The game also felt like it was flying through the story. The game only took awhile to get through because the gameplay and side stuff took awhile, the story moments were always super short and just ""This is the thing to be done, next thing, go. Okay, do new thing"" with no nuance, no moments to breath or world build. Barely an explanation.

Combat is.... Fine. It's fine. I don't have a problem with it except that some regular enemies are just HP towers that it takes forever to kill and you just grind it down. They aren't dangerous, they just take FOREVER. And they're regular monsters. Hope you like grinding away at a single monster for 3-5 minutes a battle just to do the same thing over again in the next square room. Gameplay and combat are not high on my list of things that need to excel in an RPG so this isn't a big deal but I hate wasting time on pointless, unfulfilling grinds. 

Overall, it's just a slightly below average game and I detest that people are praising what to me feels like low effort. I understand that the studio that made it didn't have all the resources in the world compared to some, but I really feel that RPGs, especially JRPGs are all doing the same things wrong.

Over the years, the franchise has developed a very solid formula which balances interesting stories, solid gameplay, and a bunch of auxiliary systems like cooking which get ""reinvented"" with each new title. Some of these titles stand out (Abyss), and some just tend to flop into oblivion (Graces F).

I mention the latter, specifically, because Graces F had some odd design decisions that tried to compensate for some major deficiencies in the core gameplay loop. While many Tales games forego a world map these days, Graces F was the first to depart from this somewhat historic element, narrowing down the ""exploration"" element of the game to focus on combat and story so that it could push the next-gen combat system of its time. Unfortunately for Graces F, the combat loop was ""all enemies are huge damage sponges, and your damage potential is developed by arte usage"" which worked at the time because of the novelty of the system, but got incredibly boring by the end. Most Tales games since have come up with creative ways to avoid the sponge effect while making combat interesting and challenging, but it seems someone forgot the lessons learned with Tales of Arise as this title makes a sharp return to long, belabored fights with minimal rewards that seem only to drag out content. Were it not for increasingly smart AI in the series that actually plays your party members well, I'm not sure I could have stomached the slog for this title, as by the time I got to around the 60% point I was avoided absolutely every fight possible to save myself 5 minutes per trash fight. Most non-human bosses fought get reskinned, and then fought again as normal enemies multiple times...with the same boss HP bar scaling. Sometimes you get multiple bosses together to add difficulty. But at the end of the day, each fight is very repetitious, forcing you to push toward chains in order to bypass absurd enemy health bars. Expect normal fights to be 5 minutes, with bosses taking upwards of 20 at times. It's not a good look given how smooth and fluid Berseria's combat was in the previous release. Given how much cinematic time is present in the game, it's clear this was done to just extend the gameplay time artificially, and it's rather annoying.

All that said, Tales of Arise is still a solid installment to the series. The cinematic element to the series was massively overhauled, and this is by far the most aesthetic and beautiful Tales game yet. Outside some light expected social justice / power of friendship nonsense most of the characters feel solid and likeable, and the story fits the Tales formula like a glove without any major hiccups. All the secondary systems like the skill tree return with an acceptable-but-not-memorable structure that feels rewarding to fill out. Fishing and cooking make their return for some reason, and it's my hope that one day the Tales creators will get a bit more creative with these systems and either remove them or stop spending so much budget on their implementation to make room for other novel things. While combat has its flaws, the difficulty curve was still there on many fights, and the ""early fights are the most difficult"" trend continues on baseline Hard difficulty with some very challenging fights that feel rewarding to complete.

It is my hope that Tales of Arise will form a sort of pair system with its successor title in much the same way Berseria did with Zestiria. Zestiria was a relatively mediocre title that touched on all the ""necessary"" elements well, but felt largely incomplete with a lot of filler...much like Arise. Zesteria was enjoyable the first time through, then felt completely forgettable until all the work Bandai-Namco put in got re-realized with Berseria for the actually good title. As is, Tales of Arise is a good game but is largely forgettable, and has minimal depth to warrant a second playthrough. Definitely on the lower end of the types of titles the franchise puts out, but still decent and not a waste of time for fans of the series.",1655826339,1655826339,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This is my favourite JRPG I've ever played so far and I don't think anything else will top this for a while, if not ever. Let me throw money at you for the soundtrack dammit.
The elephant in the room first of all, the amount of DLC's and other packs that are available, don't bother, absolutely not needed. 

No spoilers in this review of course, this game is one that I absolutely recommend to everyone to pick up immediately, to play the very lengthy, but mind blowing story to experience for yourself. If the devs took it the extra mile to actually change the map and put us in the events after the story instead of putting us back just before the final boss, that would've been amazing. However, after the 48 hour journey, there were still a few questions left unanswered, but when you finish the story, it feels like it just doesn't matter. The character development I was looking for in all of them was there, and to top it all off, Ayaka's ""Blue Moon"", and ""Hello, Again"", are absolutely beautiful pieces of music. There is PLENTY of dialogue to go through, so if you're not a fan of that it may take away from the experience a little, but I do like going through everything story wise. 

It's really bittersweet knowing that there are no plans to expand the story for these characters, but it's probably best to leave it as is even though I just want more, if they brought them back in another game, I wouldn't mind it at all. 
A one and done story, leaving a great aftertaste for us players and for the devs. 

The combat, while towards the end, it does start to feel a bit repetitive, is very enjoyable when you start getting the most out of it. You can play different characters, each with their own sets of abilities, from physical attacks to many types of Astral Artes. Building up combos with the whole Boost Strike system is very addictive, and stringing them all together with the satisfying execute animations is just the cherry on top. All of the Boost Strike executes are all a joy to look at, whoever worked on the animations, VFX and SFX all deserve a payrise. I can watch the fight choreography all day.
The annoying thing can be that there are a few times where I noticed that characters do repeat lines which if you can't unhear them it can get annoying. The enemies you fight have a decent amount of variety, but I wish there was just a bit more than just different elements of the same enemy. 

The world is huge, plenty of screenshot material. A lot of areas to explore with a variety of locations, a big problem I've across though is just all the NPC's all mostly look the same, especially when it comes to companions of the main cast. It's odd, surely the close friends of a Lord don't look exactly the same as the random civilian NPC on the street from this other city that's miles away from where we are. It needed more unique character models.

Overall, I had an blast playing through this game from start to finish. While I'd say it's definitely worth the full price, (except for the dlc) on sale it's a game that you should 100% pick up.  Came across no bugs or glitches, astounding story, cast, music, art direction, and gameplay. 
When it gets to the point where you 100% this game, you're exiting the game for the final time, and you hear ""Hello, Again"" with the gorgeous animation of the OP, it's going to be sad knowing there's nothing else left to do, and that the whole game will live inside your head rent free.

The Side Quest at first were very simple Cookie Cutter Fetch Quest, I was more interested if these Side Quest had Voiced Dialogue to keep me hooked, but I'm a Lazy Reader and I would've much preferred if it had voices.

I liked the combat, however later in the game when you have a Team Mate that can cast Powerful Spells, it can be very Overwhelming the amount of what is happening on screen and makes huge and small Enemies very hard to see and could disrupt your combo or almost 1 shot you.

The characters and their story wouldn't be as annoying if they would just shut up for at least ten minutes about anything. And the repetition about every point they make late game even outside combat is just... tiring. Their social commentaries are so ham-fisted, and they make such commentaries during every cut-scene and every skit with an SJW character in it (particularly the last two you get). It's almost like the devs think their audience is stupid and ignorant to themes of oppression and hatred. It sickens me with how life-affirming it is to the SJW crowd, even though I count myself as a reasonably open-minded sort of person.

So why did I keep playing it to 68 hours if the story was so pedantic and eye-rolling? The enemy designs and combat mechanics are pretty good. The accessory crafting system almost -- ALMOST -- made me bust out a spreadsheet for figuring out how to make the best stuff (great sign for me). Once I got to the post-game and ground my characters to 100 on the final super-boss, all this felt hollow, but it was fun while it lasted.

I'm not interested in getting all the achievements, though. One more hour spent in battle with these characters at a fully audible volume or with a skit playing that I don't skip two seconds in will make my eyes roll out of my head. Story-centric games like this (with characters that just won't stop shouting things at the top of their lungs or won't stop reiterating the same saccharin points to infinity) just don't hold me like that. I spent most of my combat time in this game on mute and missed nothing, and I skipped most of the skits, too.

Pro tip: when they start repeating the same lines over and over again, turn the game volume down and cruise. When they start going into diatribes that they should have finished with centuries ago, just skip them. It's okay. There is no setting to adjust that shuts them up in combat or to keep their dialog out of combat unique. It's like watching Jo-Jo or Death Note on repeat; dumb/fake-smart fun the first time around but never fun afterward. If that kind of game doesn't interest you, stay FAR away from this. It's half the reason why I haven't given Tales of... the time of day since Symphonia when I was a teen, too much auditory vomit and not enough interesting plot to justify the lack of nostalgia goggles.

I've played JRPGs for a long time now, and this is easily the worst of the big AAA titles out there.  It's incredibly disappointing primarily because the game starts off well enough and makes you think it  might actually be enjoyable, but as you progress, it just becomes more and more hollow before you realize you're banging your head against a brick wall and not even enjoying it anymore.

COMBAT:  Combat starts off okay, but progressively becomes worse.  Enemies are mostly all creatures called Zeugals, and they all look basically the same - some mutated purple-ish mutant-ish animal-ish thing.  Sometimes you'll fight the bird Zeugal, sometimes you'll fight the mage Zeugal, but the fact remains that the designs are so boring and unmemorable that I can't recall the name of a single enemy.  Doesn't really help that the cast only refers to them as Zeugals,  But I'm getting lost in the weeds - after the lady with the boat, every enemy basically becomes a giant damage sponge.  Every single one.  It's mindnumbingly dull and you get very little experience or money from anything.  There are type weaknesses and advantages, but the game is terrible at telegraphing how many enemies will be in a particular encounter, so if you want to fight something, you may very well have to run from combat, spend ten minutes altering your kit (again, for a single encounter) and then reengaging.  You can switch characters to fight with, but they all suck in various ways.  Law dies instantly, Rinwell dies a little lett quickly than Law, Dohalim is the only decent character in combat that isn't Alphen, Kisara just makes your inevitable death take forever, and Shionne sucks but is a requirement to have on the party because she's the dedicated pink-haired anime healer character.

STORY: What starts off as interesting becomes boring.  I don't want to go into spoilers, but TL;DR - Revenge bad.  As for the characters, they all start off as driven and then devolve into tropes.  I don't remember much about each character beyond what was reinforced over and over again.  Alphen likes spicy food.  Shonne like food.  Law hates vegetables.  Rinwell likes sweets.  Dohalim likes acting like a homunculus.  Kisara won't shut up about how much money you spend.  I don't know why they felt the need to keep bringing those things up, but considering it spends 90% of the skits on those ideas, I'm going to conclude that those are the most important aspects to those characters.  Oh yeah, Skits...  There are these little optional dialog ""cutscenes"" you can watch called Skits.  These are for characters to give their thoughts on events that happen after they happen.  You might wonder why these aren't just passive conversations that happen during the story.  The answer is because the writers are bad and don't know how to organically integrate dialog with in-game events.  As a cherry on top, sometimes you'll get 4 or 5 of these in a row, and completely forget what you were doing because Law just had to muse over such philosophical concepts as ""Why are bad people bad?""

WORLD: I'm sure it's very pretty.  I wouldn't know because to navigate the place, you basically have to have your eyes glued to the mini-map.  There's not cohesion in the world design, and by the final dungeon, literally every room is copy-pasted and looks the exact same.  Hope you like getting lost.

TERRIBLE DLC: Oh, did you hope to get the full game experience for $60?  Well you're a big dummy.  This game locks combat features and whatnot behind paid DLC.  Scummy, right?  Almost as scummy as that EXP and Money boster DLC that they made because they intentionally made the game as frustratingly grindy as possible and made the payout from fights and selling items to meager.

In conclusion - this game only won Best JRPG because there was no other competition.  I make a better game every morning in my toilet.  Don't buy it.  Don't listen to anyone who says it's good - they're objectively wrong.",1634505905,1655388615,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts slow, which is common for the series, but perhaps TOO slow, with combat feeling very grindey and the story very black-and-white. But by the second area, I was very hooked. 

The story seems to get alot of flak for being just mediocre, but I think that's unfair; as I said, it's very basic when it starts, but alot of depth is added over time. Note that I said ""depth"" and not so much ""complexity""; think Star Wars over Star Trek--while there is some ""technobabble"", the story is not one about complex situations or technical problems, it's about a journey with timeless themes. We get 6 characters, all with unique backgrounds and perspectives, who go through solid arcs. One criticism seems to be that the characters are all too heroic--there's no anti-heroes or backstabbers or anything. But whether you like that or not is just a matter of taste; I have no problem with some stories lacking those things, and the characters do still have some conflict and have to grow to be able to work together. Quite a few themes are explored, most from various different angles, and that gives more to think about than a tale that's 75% just learning terminology and lore. I'd have hung around with this cast for another 100 hours if that was an option.

Combat is fun, as most people seem to agree; the Tales formula has yet again been revamped while still keeping to the same core style, and is still engaging. Is it as deep as something like God of War or Devil May Cry? No, it's not meant to be; it's meant to be chaotic, crazy fun, but still with an element of skill that is fair for the average gamer (experts at action games may want to kick up the difficulty right from the start). All 6 characters have unique movesets and abilities and different ways to play them, but there's enough here that you won't feel bored if you only play the main hero for the entire game. Creating weapons is pretty basic, but creating accessories is somewhat flawed, as you can't do too much with the system until late game (and then it's possible to break the game). And I do wish the game had picked up pace a little faster; combat is VERY barebones until you've clocked some hours--we didn't need it drip-fed to us quite that slowly. More options for party AI, like the older games had, would have been welcome as well.

Besides those main aspects, the world is interesting, the game looks and sounds fine, sidequests are fairly simplistic but very hard to miss and mostly just boil down to fighting a monster somewhere, and the simple act of globe-trotting is enjoyable. Overall, it's a very solid JRPG doing what you expect from a JRPG; if you like the genre at all, I 100% recommend you pick it up, and if you don't like the genre, I strongly advise you to buy something else.",1655151127,1655151127,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

It started out strong, with many improvements when it comes to gameplay, but the story is just plain bad. Not only is it quite basic, most of the story progression is somehow outside of any gameplay. Character X died after you've known him for two hours of game time? Suddenly that character is the main driving point of character development for two main characters.  Its just so bland and comes out of nowhere, it hurts.

The chemistry between the main cast leaves very much to be desired. It also changes drastically in a matter of minutes - at one time, it looks like there's finally some character development coming your way, characters are going past some hurdles, coming to terms with other character's flaws, just to be mad at them a couple minutes later for the same things they've seemingly came to terms with.

Also, when will developers finally realise that removing powers from the main character after a big plot point is just an awful mechanic, that brings nothing but being annoying to deal with.

Its not a bad game, but mostly it has the gameplay itself going for it. Story-wise, its really bad. Pay-offs are non-existant, character development is awful.",1655071581,1655071581,False,8,0,0.571499288082122803,0,True,False,False

The story is captivating with well written characters, deep thought provoking scenarios with plenty of twists to keep things interesting, along with a beautiful art style which enhances it's vast and otherworldly environments.

The voice acting in this game was superb and really lent itself to the characters personalities. The dialogue and party chat never felt boring, I watched hundreds of cut-scenes and each one felt interesting and entertaining. The casual banter and witty humour amongst the party helped bring each of the characters to life as they showed their different opinions and interests to each other. I also really liked the comic/manga panel way of showing dialogue cut-scenes.

movie cut-scenes and fight choreography were amazing to watch as well. The smooth lifelike animation and facial expressions made the experience feel more real, and the action packed fight scenes (especially with the mysterious swordsman) were so captivating to watch.

The combat is definitely one of my favourite aspects of the game with the ability customisation, team assist artes and finally the combo finishers. The combat design along with the cinematic magic and particle effects also looked great with the weapon artes and spells, especially with the explosive finishers. My only issue is that it takes a little whilefor the combat to get REALLY interesting and you have to wait until a bit later into the game to really enjoy these features when you have all party members and you have upgraded your characters enough to have enough BP to be able to chain combos together properly. Until then the combat can seem pretty boring and repetitive, only being able to string together a few hits with one or two artes in between, but I understand that this is to build momentum for upgrading characters an fighting stronger enemies and to encourage players to upgrade their characters as quickly as possible.

The story is fantastic, the voice acting is solid, the combat is immensely fun, the environments are all nice and interesting and the pacing is reasonable. It starts feeling a little formulaic as you go from 'chapter to chapter' but they spice it up the further you go.

The only thing I could really complain about is that in the latter half of the game, the characters pretty much beat a dead horse dialog-wise in the cutscenes, repeating the same themes over and over and over and over.. and over... until I found myself speeding through some of the dialog because it became so predictable. It's like they forgot between scenes that they *just* discussed the topic 10 minutes ago.

I wouldn't say the game has high replayability, and it's entirely possible to 100% in the first run on Normal difficulty, in about 80 hours or so.

Graphics
Story

CONS
Combat System
Presentation
Dialogue
Skits

Graphics: The game looks great, no question. Definitely some of the highest quality visuals one could expect.

Story: The initial premise is interesting, and the overall story is decent. However, the presentation is not very good, which I'll get to.

Combat System: They combat is much less like the Tales games everyone liked, and more like an Action game, probably based on Godeater's combat system. It relies more on maintaining long combos and not getting hit. Basically, you either stunlock the enemy or you have a hard time. But the game arbitrarily ends combos for no reason, and makes it extremely easy for your combos to be interrupted, contrary to enemies. Sometimes a large Spell is cast, amd an enemy does some special action, and it's impossible to tell what's going on. Avoiding enemy attacks and benefitting from it relies in precision timing, which is practically impossible most of the time because some enemies fake you out, and some move suddenly without giving you time to react. It just isn't fun, and enemies take too many hits, and all have armor. It's more like a chore than actual rpg combat.

Presentation: As I said above, the plot is decent, but the game seems to feel the need to constantly repeat plot details, sometimes even acting like something the characters already knew is suddenly a surprise to them. The character development goes through many loops, as the characters apparently need to be constantly assured that they trust each other. They go through basically the same conversations about relying on one another probably ten times each. The repetition dragged the experience down, and made me feel like the characters were retarded.
Despite the plot having global consequences, the world felt cramped and small. There is no overworld, so you only see the world through the narrow pathways you travel through, and 6 or 7 settlements. For a globe-spanning plot, the presentation of the world should have been much wider. After thinking about this for a while, I came up with an idea for an alternative: While you can still have the actual playable area be small, when moving to a new area, a montage animation of the party travelling through the land in between the playable areas would make the world seem more full and immersive, without needing any complicated open-world mechanics.

Dialogue: As I said above, some conversations repeat throughout the course of the game, each time acting like something new. Also, something that bothered me personally was that characters would use expressions or phrases that don't make sense within the setting. This may be just something with the English translation, but it bothered me.

Skits: Skits used to be fun or quirky, or gave you insight into how characters behaved outside of cutscenes and combat. Now, 90% of skits are just to repeat the same plot details that have already been explained ad nauseum. I don't mind the new style, but most of them seemed completely pointless to anyone old enough to follow the plot anyway.

Overall, the game was enjoyable, and largely better than most formulaic AAA titles put out these days. But unlike the good Tales games of old, it's not one that I'll feel like replaying once I've cleared everything.

I played Tales of Berseria not long ago (also a sale) and I had more fun but also in that game the boss fights annoyed me.

Just finished this one and I will delete it to avoid more frustrations. I had could kill few more bosses for whatever reason or start new game+ but I couldnt be bothered. My char is level 53.

The bosses in this game are plain boring and hard, I used to many potions so I always needed a full stock. My main char (melee) is as retarded as the one in Berseria who loves standing in front of the boss. I might play it wrong but most of the time during (the hard) boss fights my main char was just running and trying to avoid while the team killed the boss.
For the rest the game was ok but the boss fights ruined the fun.

Most of the game: Meh. Neither the story nor the characters really clicked with me.

The last 4-6 hours: A freaking torture. It starts with a tunnel of hours of boring cut scenes. Seriously, the game talks for 5 minutes, then you walk 10 meters, new cut scene, 3 new optional dialogues to listen to.

Playing on hard mode from the beginning and trying not to use too many of the buffs from the deluxe edition since it was on sale. The character development is surprisingly good, and the aesthetics of the game are great for me. 

Pros:
The graphics and aesthetics are really satisfying. I like the combat animations. I really feel like the main character of an anime which is pretty cool. Figuring out how to actually use the strategies and capitalize using of the characters took a little while. That being said, figuring it out as you go isn't so bad. Next, exploring each area to the fullest is pretty satisfying because you can find a lot of stuff you will need for the upcoming boss fights. Finally, the voice acting is very well done and adds quite a bit to the story. That being said, the characters talk A LOT during combat and can get a little annoying. 

Cons:
The money in the game is kind of ridiculous when it comes to how much the important supplies cost which is frustrating. I didn't realize what I was doing when I claimed the free 100,000 gald from the DLC until it already happened, and if I hadn't gotten that in the beginning I wouldn't have been able to buy enough of the supplies I needed for some of the boss fights. Now, when it comes to boss fights, it is very frustrating that some of the main mechanics for trash fights just don't apply. It becomes a slog fest and is very resource intensive without many options to mitigate that. 

Overall, I am really enjoying this game and it easily sucks you into the story. I have found myself being surprised it's 3am more than once because I just wanted to get to the next zone and accidentally don't stop. The costume customization is pretty cool, and it applies in the cutscenes too. However, it can sometimes make the important moments feel pretty silly when you're in sunglasses and devil horns talking about the fate of the world. This is one of my first traditional JRPGs (I think pokemon counts as one and I've played them all, but they don't really feel like a JRPG to me) and I have enjoyed every moment. Highly recommend this game.

The combat system is familiar for veteran Tales players with familiar skills and weapons, and it's not unforgiving for new players to the series. One can experiment to their heart's content, mixing different Artes and using different combos in real-time combat. Animations are smooth in combat, though some improvements can be made such as animation canceling for Artes and more advanced graphics settings (all of which can be adjusted with mods). Story-wise, it's clear that the main plot focuses on the two protagonists, Alphen and Shionne, following their origins to their inevitable conclusion. Character-wise, 2 characters fell flat in character development around halfway through the game. The story is linear in nature, but that isn't new for Tales games nor is it a bad thing. One can expect the game to take around 45-50 hours, if they choose to do everything in the game. Level progression is pretty linear with little grinding to fully max out both level and skill points. The same can also be said for gear, simply equip the gear that raises your numbers. My biggest gripe with the game is the bonding mechanic at campsites. If the player chooses to neglect this mechanic early on or rarely use campsites throughout the game, they will likely be deterred from 100% the game towards the end. It takes 1 hour in real time to progress to the next level of a character's bond. I personally believe the bonding mechanic can be improved by having it be purely based on story progression rather than waiting out a timer.

I really don't want to review games poorly, but I keep taking chances on well received and overhyped bad games thinking I might like them while being utterly wrong altogether. Because I really enjoyed Final Fantasy XV and all of the positive reviews on YouTube for Tales - all from sponsored channels I might add - led me to believe I might like this JRPG game, but I was dead wrong with an expensive mistake since I bought the deluxe edition. 

The problem is an overly complicated combat system with a high emphasis on multi-hit combos that simply isn't fun. At first it might seem alright, but as soon as they bombard with so many different abilities the learning curve goes from 0 to 100 real quick. You have normal attacks, offensive arts, support arts, magic, charged magic attacks, boost attacks, blast attacks, character perks and all of these are broken up into ground and aerial skills. Your goal is to find a well rounded team synergy so you can fluidly switch between the various skills and characters for those flashy 100+ anime style combo strings. However, you have to throw elementalism into the mix meaning you need to learn the elemental types of enemies, what elements the enemies are weak against and which characters are the most effective against certain enemy types and this is important for switching between characters when trying to continuously chain combos between your team members. 

The intricate and nuanced combat system is so overly complicated that it is only going to appeal to a very small demographic of hardcore JRPG fans who have the time and dedication to try to master it... this means it will most likely be less fun for everyone else. 

I really want to address the niche JRPG fanboy trolls who want to attack me in defense of this game's ""depth"". This unnecessarily complicated combat isn't fun for someone who isn't a hardcore JRPG fan because they conflated the mechanic with redundancy. There are several different ways to accomplish the same or similar skills while achieving the same net result. This isn't depth, this is Bandai Namco trying to reinvent the wheel when it may look fancy and different, but still rolls down the road the same as every wheel which comes before it.

If you're not getting the hang of those high hit 70+ combo strings then it simply isn't fun and many enemies become tanky taking a lot of damage in prolonged battles... unless you spend money on the SP boost which still isn't fun combat only slightly more tolerable. If you have the time and patience to master it then it might be fun for a while until it can start feeling like repetitive and stale combat when you're trying to string together massive combo chains every enemy encounter. 

In this instance less is more and the combat could have been streamlined into a more cohesive system and still be good. Those fanboy trolls aren't as clever as they think either since the Jester award isn't the derogatory insult they think it is - they're wasting points to give me an award that gives me bonus points because any award is considered a positive engagement on the platform. So GJ you special bunch of winners. 👍

Let's put this into perspective and it's important to note there are [b]THREE BILLION[/b] gamers worldwide. Right now this game has a 90% ""very positive"" rating among 16,659 reviews which means 14,993 people really enjoyed it. Not everyone writes reviews so if you double that number to factor in the likelihood of higher favorbility with unwritten reviews you get 29,986 people really like this game so that's almost 30k people. 

30k is only 3% out of 1,000,000 or 0.00001% out of 3,000,000,000. For context 0.01 = 1% in a decimal system so not so impressive numbers now, right?

Oh, and f**k a particular sponsored YouTube channel praising this as the epitome of JRPG gaming, I'm never taking his opinions into consideration again when trying to determine if I want to try a certain game. He and Bandai Namco owe me $100 as far as I'm concerned and they can split the bill down the middle.",1653788022,1653872720,False,9,5,0.474446773529052734,2,True,False,False

The famous :""I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS GAME I REALLY TRIEEEEEED!"" Well, I really tried to FINISH that game, but I really could NOT allow myself to like it after a few hours. I really wanted to go full blast and note all the issues with logic, but had to stop at the realm of wind. Anyways, here is a compilation!

Issues with logic
1-Why are the oppressors, who have the technology to travel in spaceships with guns, do not have any guns in the slave camp to capture the main character and Shionne when they escape?
2-Why is it I see a knight from a supposedly super advanced civilization defeated by medieval weaponry?
3-Why is it the main character, if he remembers nothing, finds it wrong that a woman he does not know about is being interrogated by the resistance who saved his life? I mean, you don’t know who she is nor who they are!
4-How can I, with a rusted sword, defeat a full clad super soldier whose armour has machinery to make him stronger? Just one room before the first battle, a npc says they have machinery in their armour!
5-As you get out of the cave, you, Shionne, the Zephyr and a crew member are surrounded by knights, ARMED WITH CROSSBOWS! C’mon man! These guys have plates with machinery, but don’t use guns?! Then, what good is their armour anyways if a mere hurling of a lance can penetrate the metal and kill one of them? Makes it hard to believe that a whole planet fell in days when local weapons could kill them.
6-Your character only begins his journey but already can almost deflect a crossbow-bolt shot at someone next to him with his sword. Kinda hard to pull, and I wouldn’t be bothered by it had it been done by someone with experience, not an amnesiac who just started his quest.
7-Shionne has a gun, at least, but why not the freaking soldiers?!!!
8-The protagonist’s head is stuck behind a mask that covers scalp, forehead, face, neck and ears… This does bring questions! How can he eat and drink? How can he wash himself, or avoid having skin disease from the lack of hygiene? How can he hear properly? How can he see?
9-After leaving the hideout and discovering the Sandinus Ravine region, I wonder how anyone could breathe in a place of permanent pyric fires scorching the land and the gates! Do people have lungs??? And I need explanation as to why vegetation can still live under the fall of ashes and of tiny red-hot drops, or with fires all around…
10-During the little event when you discover about cooking, Shionne says she is impressed to see the main character eat with the mask. The way it is made and stuck to his face? Impossible, sorry.
11-The village of Ulzebek has a guard at the entrance to the northwest says they have to keep Zeugles out of the village because there is not gate. WHY IS THERE NO GATE TO BEGIN WITH?!!!
12-The hideout of the Crimson Crows in Ulzebek… It is… Astonishingly obvious! And… For a meeting of the resistance in a secret hideout to have the plan known by the other villagers gossiping about it? Yeah… Not too convincing. Seems like the Crimson Crow are uncapable of secrecy.
13-So… Where did Zephyr get so many fighters to distract Balseph’s troops, if his army is larger than the population of Ulzebek?
14-You strap the blazing sword, which makes your gauntlet glimmer with heat, on your back… Why would you burn your—oh, true, for some untold reasons, your cloths are not affected. Only your glove.
15-So, you expect me, the player, to take the Renans seriously when they can’t even have competent soldiers? I mean, the first soldier I attack has his back to me and I barely entered! These guys have advanced technology, and yet they are as dumb as a potato.
16-In the first encounter with the fire avatar, Alphen succeeds in stopping a punch from above by holding his sword above his head. Just no… Not so early in the story… Should not be capable of doing such a thing with 20 levels in difference.
17-Okay, you want me to believe the whole planet fell in a matter of days when the invasion happened three centuries ago, and that the Rhenans could also obliterate life on the planet should they so wish. WITH SUCH A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE, HOW DID ONE OF THE FREAKING LORDS DIE AND LOST A WHOLE WAR TO THE RESISTANCE SO EASILY?!!
18-First zeugles I fight in Cyslodia are wolves, which were also one of the first monsters to fight in Calaglia. How can my character say “oh, the zeugles are so different here, nyaha! Why is that?” then to get an answer from the little girl saying “hehehenye!! They had to adapt to the climate!” … Wolves are wolves…
19-If you look carefully  at the sword Alphen carries, it is not attached to you, it is actually floating. Same thing with the blazing sword.
20-When you start a battle, sometimes the characters will say something. Sadly, when Shionne says “I won’t forgive you”, I can’t help but wonder what can she reproach a monster she never saw?
21-When Zephyr gets surrounded by four gunners, why didn’t they shoot him from a distance in secret? They finally have Rhenans with guns, but no snipers?! Plus, they run so close to him he could actually punch them if he so wanted. When you have ranged weapons, you don’t need to surround someone so close tight…
22-In Messia, the first town in the winter area… Why is the cow, then the bull, and the two chickens, just casually standing there in the snow without any supervision or some kind of wandering restrictions? Also, chickens don’t fare well in the snow, as they can get frostbite.
23-North of Messia, I discovered I can swim in a lake without ice despite being in a wintery place. First, I would have hypothermia. Second, the lake should have ice.
24-Care to explain me how crystals could just be sprouting from a stone bridge???
25-All right… First time you meet the mysterious swordsman, how can your party does not notice the corpses of Zeugules until Alhpen smells the blood? They are barely 2-3 meters away from them! You could sea earlier that big wolf boss jumping down from the cliff, why can’t you see the dead wolves in front of you?!
26-Interesting how Rimwell said to have never seen such a bright day before going to Calaglia? Okay, not only is the climate too abruptly different, but the sky as well it would seem. Going through a cave sure can bring you on the other side apparently.
	It is eventually explained with suitable explanations for light, but not for snow and climate.
27-Okay, if water is not moving, then it freezes in snowy biomes. Why is this calm lake not frozen in the Nevira Snowplains?
28-The first npc I talk to in Cysloden is a woman who has short sleeves, no hat or gloves.
29-So anyone can betray anyone in Cysloden thanks to the Snake Eyes. Pretty sure Alphen should hide his blazing sword because it kinda gives him away?
30-I am the only one to have mist coming out of my mouth as I exhale in winter place. Apparently Npcs do not.
31-Why is no one wearing hats in Cysloden at night and winter?
32-After the scene where Shione says she wants to see where the lights in Cysloden points to, you have an event where Rimwell says everyone is suspicious and can report someone else simply for being different. Well, I am impressed we took no measures to pass incognito.
33-In Cysloden, a member of the Silversword is preoccupied by the fact zeugles are camping the exit of the group’s secret way out of the city. Apparently, it is not of high importance enough to inform the other members because they are too busy. TOO BUSY TO MAITAIN A WAY OUT?!!
34-Two Dahnan men in Cysloden say : “Hey, I hear an outsider’s gotten in! Let’s submit a tip and get the payoff before anybody can beat us to the punch!” Yes, so why don’t you report me as I stand next to you with a blazing sword, an iron mask, and clearly wearing not local fashion cloths?
35-So, I see a cutscene of a guy getting a profit from one of the snake eyes for reporting a woman, and then Alphen is right behind him asking why he reported the lady. Er",1653867837,1653868411,False,7,4,0.498071670532226563,6,True,False,False

The challenge is normally within the game itself but buying items just saves you so much headache.

The cast is falls short in being interesting in anyway and most of the dialogue I found myself skipping though to avoid falling asleep on my desk. Unlike Berseria which had a comic relief characeter, this game does not and it didn't take long at how much one was needed. The combat is mechanically better than Berseria but I hope you enjoy play the same character because you will never finish this game playing anything but Law or Alphen. The other 4 characters are simply unplayable unless you enjoy spamming healing because the ally AI are so terrible and lack any tankiness. The boss fights are so terrible and feel outdated for a 2021 game. The boss will start doing crazy combos then proceed to stand there AFK while you maybe get two hits in and they start doing another combo with no form of telegraph and they have infinite hyper armour while doing so. All of this defeats the point of the combo system you have because you can never actually use it. You get better at the game fighting normal enemies and customising a move set that fits you only to have those skills sent out the window because the bosses just tank through everything.

There are certainly people I think would enjoy it but I didn't which was a massive disappointment as I had very high hopes for the game. It fails to find an identity as it tries to mix a jrpg and modern action games. The result is a grindfest that requires a lot of attention in order to dodge attacks and slowly chip away at the enemies gigantic healthbars. 

The graphics are fine, for the most part, doesn't quite compare to standard in western rpgs but that is not unexpected or a dealbreaker. The character design is one of the best things about the game along with the enemy design. The cutscenes are admittedly drop dead gorgeous and the music that goes along with the intro is fantastic. 

The story is interesting for the first half but loses a lot of momentum later on and simply drags on for much longer than it should have. The friendship the characters develop between each other are great and a lot deeper than one might expect from a game such as this and take time to develop. I would have expected and wanted the game to end about 10 hours before it did which was such a shame. 

Combat is the main reason I cannot recommend the game to others and is what ultimately made me want to stop playing. There is a lot of it and no way of getting around it because you are going to need every ounce of exp you can get your hands on. At times I even felt like I needed to go back and farm exp despite battling every enemy that came my way. The fights themselves are very slow and the healthbars of the enemies are as stated before, enormous. You are also unable to cancel your own attacks with a dodge and that leads to a need for a rather defensive playstyle and further increases the time it takes to battle enemies. Personally I could not find the patience to keep reacting to enemy attacks for so long periods of time. Eventually this lead to me lowering the difficulty to a level where I could pretty much face tank all the enemies. 

Exploration is fine, it is not something that is particularly interesting but doesn't diminish the overall experience. A fair amount of items have been placed about making it feel worth it and very powerful items indeed can be found if you venture far enough.

Graphics, exploration and story are fine, the characters interesting and cutscenes visually pleasing. It is the combat that destroys the expeirence for me but if you can get over that you will likely have a blast.",1653423057,1653423057,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, I went to go write a review and saw a lot of negatives on the buyable skill trees. I didn't even now about them till now XD (past the 40 hour mark). I bought the collab edition cuz i thought it was hilarious to have SAO skins. But to my pleasant surprise, dlc's don't activate until you manual activate them individual per run. That means I didn't have to start with all the boosts and advantages. So the only dlc I actually activated was the SAO skins, because I wanted a vanilla start and run. Starting my first run as if new game+ just didn't seem fun to me. I can see the dlc's coming in handy for additional play throughs though.

So I had never seen nor used these ""dlc exclusive skill trees"" (which come with the three main dlc costumes i guess). And my gameplay has been absolutely fabulous even without them. They are not needed or noticed missing. Over half way through the game and I definitely feel like I got my money's worth. It is by far one of the best jrpgs (traditionally just rpg) i have ever played. I've played almost all of the FF series, the KH series, and a plethora of others. 

Deets: 

Gameplay:
6 playable characters. Party of 4. every character has activable support skills and you can switch party members out freely throughout combat. You can choose which skills the cpu allies can/can't use and how often. Use moves to gain move xp and learn more moves and unlock skill trees. Use different moves to get good dmg and combos, (very anti button mash. but that don't stop me from making one op move and spamming XD). do combos with allies. 

Story:
Ya, the story suffers after the first half. But tbh, I think the story in the first half is more than good enough to make up for it. Besides, it takes you a long time to get through that first half. And I'm used to this pattern. Same thing happens in games like FF7 and Okami. Not the biggest deal. 

Graphics:
Are great. There's great potential for 3d anime games because there aren't as many poly's to get right like in a more realistic human/monster model. There are traditional anime cutscenes though, which I thought was nice and refreshing. 

Grind:
A bit, this is one of the few things I dislike about the game. There is always grind, but much like in CrossCode (another superb game) enemies give you less xp depending on level disparity, which i think is an annoying system, but whatever, keeps of the pace of the game moving i guess.

 And the reason why I say this is because of the poor execution of the story.  The overall theme and story plot line is relatively average, but what kills the story in this game is the characters, especially the dialog between characters becomes exhausting to listen to. Rinwell’s character quickly went from intriguing to annoying and I just wanted the character to shut up.

 	There are several times the characters tend to point things out to the player as if it wasn't explained an hour or thirty minutes ago. Specifically, about a plot twist, the writers seem so proud of it. The Dialog points it out often with a party member to say, “hey did you know about this plot twist, you know this plot twist that we figure out thirty minutes ago, what do you think about this plot twist,” to either pat themselves on the back or to pad the game. Which is also in the game because they make it seem like the game needs characters to interact with each other at campsites, but I don't really see any development until plot demands it not when the characters should naturally be engaged from the gameplay. 

I would say this game while fun would not hold the interested of its players and if it is not dying like the other Bandai Games, it will be forgot soon enough just like Scarlet Nexus and countless other current year anime games. This game should be pick up as a definitive edition for no more than $25 dollars anymore then the player isn’t getting his or her money’s worth.

 The characters and story pacing is just.... a mess and poorly written. to go from how the characters act in a story scene to how they act in a skit feels so jarring and uncomfortable and cringe-y i can't believe people okay'd on it. 

I cannot enjoy the combat on lower or higher difficulty. it relies heavily on combo-ing thank to every enemie having havel from dark souls level of poise and bosses having complete stun immunity. but also punishes you for trying to combo too much it feels with how it stuns you after a lock, leaving you to pretty much having to dodge roll after every combo. I'm sure i'd get better at dodging but with how much shit going on screen and me being deaf unable to hear the attack cues, it just awful to try and dodge imo. Maybe having dodge set to haptic triggers instead of a on off button makes it feels like there a weird delay in the action.

 I don't like how they handled the CP system for in world stuff and out world it just feels like an after thought. Grinding is so heavily discouraged its a joke. 

Jumping is the most useless fucking thing in this game and any attempt of platforming they added would of been better off just not doing it in my opinion.

A game that uses Racism and slavery as it's core foundation. Yet every character struggles to accept differences, after becoming more aware, they become ignorant again. Probably a fault of the English Translation and VA not portraying proper meanings behind the moments/scenes.

Despite putting in a lot more time on the game I cannot recommend it. The monetization issues are very real and even purchased at a considerable discount the game is hampered by the monetization. Experience is too hard to obtain, money too hard to obtain, skills and actual gameplay are locked behind a pay wall that is above and beyond the main purchase price of the game. This is unacceptable and enough by itself to not recommend this game.

Even if none of that were the case, I could still not recommend the game. The first half or so of the game is actually pretty strong with enjoyable characters and locals. I was enjoying it quite a lot but there comes a point when you have pretty well accomplished your initial goal that is set towards the beginning and the game completely falls apart. Dungeons become uninspired and sparse and the back half of the game is just a barrage of Xenogears tier cut scenes strung together punctuated by brief gameplay for bad dungeons and the occasional boss fight. It was very frustrating that the game would give you back control of the characters only to take a few more steps and get another 20 minutes of cut scenes.

Save your time and money and play something else. This is just a huge wasted opportunity of a game.

----Original Review Below------
Look, there's most likely a good game in here but it is inside of a whole bunch of scummy DLC and frankly you probably shouldn't support it with your money. I actually feel bad that I spent money on this rather than maybe waiting for it to be on sale for cheap in a year or so. In particular, paying money to make the grind less miserable is just unacceptable. Plenty of other good games to play without plopping down for crappy DLC practices and supporting Bandai Namco's equally crap social media policies.

Also, why in the word are there two different menu systems and why I can't I quit completely out of the game without having to jump through an extra screen.

Also really not seeing why the ""cure point"" system exists. Do not like.

The new engine helps a lot but it still needs to drop a couple of things to complete its transformation into a fully fledged modern AA title (Much like Yakuza changed and got vastly improved year after year simply by dropping its most annoying gameplay elements)

I would say, first 70 to 80% of the game are a 9/10. Easy. The fact the game is not AAA allows them to cut straight to the point. It does what it does well, with ease. The engine does the job very well.

Then we get to the last 20% where all the tales of gimmick show their ""ugly"" face. Grindy, convoluted and needlessly long last dungeon. The last dungeon is truly a chore. I took no pleasure doing it. It basically is a very long generic map, empty, with something like 20 generic semi boss taking each 3 to 5 minutes to dispose of because their HP's have been boosted and your level scaling does not do much to shorten the thing.

All of that with cut-scenes every 5 to 10 minutes, mostly exposition and dialogue.

All in all it is very good but I hope the next tales of will give up this gimmick and will keep the grindy/the exposition for the hidden/NG+ dungeons and keep their main storyline straight forward and efficient.

Because tales of is about fight gameplay and artes. The over-convoluted ending is a gimmick from another time. It's ok to be there for fans and people who wants to push it to the endgame but the overall game suffers from them being a ""must do"".

Yakuza succeded, I really hope tales of will too.",1653022521,1653022521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only tales game up to this point was Berseria, and that game had secured myself among my Top 5 Narratives I’ve ever experienced, so I was more than willing to give Arise a try one I finally got the hardware to play it.

While I wasn’t disappointed with Arise’s scenario and characters, it wasn’t quite on the level of Berseria’s masterclass storytelling.

I will say now that this game has a bit of a slow start combat wise. It was moderately frustrating at first – even as someone who was familiar with Tales combat – and I wasn’t sold on the main character at all initially, but things quickly took off about 2 hours into the experience.

The plot overall genuinely surprised me and I saw almost none of the twists coming. English voices are superb, we have many familiar VA’s here you’ll recognize, and it’s a joy to see them bounce off of each other.
Characters weren’t nearly as solid as Berseria’s cast, but I loved them all the same and I *wish* they took some of their relationships a little further.

Gameplay-wise, this combat is a massive dopamine rush. Its very overwhelming at first but once you learn not to button mash and really wrap your head around the artes/boost system, it becomes so fluid and fun and thrilling to blast the crap out of enemies with flashy cinematic moves.

Arise visually looks stunning, absolutely gorgeous, and once I replaced my failing harddrive I had no problem playing it with Max settings on my I7, GTX 1660. The soundtrack is incredible, but what else do you expect from Tales at this point.

The story takes a wild turn just after the halfway mark and from that point on I didn’t do a single side quest and just powered through to the end. Which is always a sign of a compelling narrative.

I would absolutely rank Tales of Arise among my favourite JRPGs. If you’re a fan of the genre and want something to really sink your teeth into for 50hrs (80hrs if you’re aiming for lots of side content too), then I’d absolutely give it a try, especially if it’s on sale.

Don’t let the sorta-slow opening act and initially confusing gameplay turn you off, this is a certified gem!

Pros:

- The combat is super fun, if a little repetitive, and has the right amount of flashiness and intricacy that I felt was promised from the trailers. Each character has a wide variety of skills and specialisations, with every one of them feeling vastly different when in the players hands. Good stuff all round.
- The world is absolutely gorgeous. Every single zone is beyond pretty; even the first zone, which is very dull, still manages to have some stunning presentation. Some of the later game areas can feel a little same-y, but overall you never feel like you're in the same place twice. (Ganath Haros is beautiful, hands down the best area in the game.)
- Music is very nice, combat music is an absolute treat and the overworld ambience is quite low-key but still enjoyable. One of the few games where I never bothered to turn down the volume.

Cons 

- The monetisation is bad. Super anti-consumer. With outfits that have skill lines locked behind them (three for each character), levels, currency, and game enhancing artefacts - it really feels jarring to have a pay-for-power system in a single player RPG.
- Late game areas and monsters drag. Hard. You feel it a little coming into the late game sections, but the lead up to the final boss in Rena takes about 3-4 hours and most of that time will be spent fighting the same, palette swapped mini-bosses from previous areas. This slog absolutely kills the momentum of the game and brings it down for me, as it also hurts the narrative pacing. Speaking of which....
- The story does NOT stick the landing. As basic as the story is I found it enjoyable, with a lot of nice story beats and healthy if predictable character development. The whole cast is interesting and bounce off each other quite well through the games scenes (about 300 of them, all quite fun to flick through). But. BUT. It fails to conclude in a way that doesn't feel forced. The natural end to the story felt like it took place about 4 hours prior but you get thrust into a massive, convoluted plot-line that makes a lick of sense yet tries to cram more concepts into its 4 hour runtime than the base game did in 20. This, paired with the massive combat slog, is super painful to play through and hurts the story way more than it should be allowed to. It overrides the natural conclusions of not only the main plot but the characters themselves for the sake of...I still can't tell. Not awesome.

Overall I think the game is great, I got 100% on it for a reason, and the presentation is off the charts. While the narrative suffers near the end I feel like the fact its a small chunk of an otherwise fantastic game lets me forgive and forget. If you can buy the game on sale I would, its a good 30-40 hours you can spend immersed in a fun, if generic, JRPG with a beautiful combat system.",1650355387,1652843737,True,119,2,0.896275460720062256,0,True,False,False

TLDR: 8.5/10 | Price is still pretty steep and questionable DLCs... some issues here and there, but well worth the time and money invested.

Plot wasn't anything too revolutionary, but it had its moments and twists that still kept me on my toes. Heck, this was probably the first game I played where I was so invested, that I actually teared up at certain points of the story, and even towards the ending.

Characters were pretty well rounded and had a lot of depth to them. The skits, which are staples in Tales games, provided a lot of insight on the different characters you'll be travelling with throughout the game. I think the only missed opportunity I saw was that they could have done more to flesh out Vholran as a villain. It felt more like he was just dropped in the game as the antithesis of Alphen, and nothing more.

Soundtrack and music in the game was great, overall. I had one specific issue when I got to a certain realm in the game where the ambient music was glitched in certain parts that it would make a loud screech and scared the bejeezus out of me when I was wearing headphones.

Gameplay mechanics were super good in this particular installment. I've played almost all of the previous Tales games and this, by far, was the most enjoyable and most fluid out of them all. If they carry on with this iteration or further polish it in the future, I have no doubt that we'll be getting even better Tales games down the road.

Overall thoughts: I love this game to bits! At my current age, I usually don't have enough patience to power through heavy narrative type games, let alone JRPGs. But this one I couldn't get off of my mind until I finished it through. Now that I've finished it, if this were any other game, I would usually just move on to the next game... but something tells me I might give it another spin in New Game+.",1652628559,1652628559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Artes : Initially an attack chain has three artes but extendable to six (so 12 for two types of artes) as you progress. The arte's type for each characters is unique and these artes choices are adjustable to match the enemy  weaknesses. The challenge is finding the suitable arte's chain so you can get good combo. Once you get it, you get more action.  So fighting enemies becomes much more fun. 

Movements : You can do movement ablilities like dodge, counter attack, jump,  double jump, jump and dodge. You will find many enemies which has fast movement so you really need to utilize these abilities to defeat it well.  This kind of fluid movement makes fighting the enemy so exciting. 

Character's Fighting Styles : Each characters has strikingly difference fighting style. It is very fun to get the different feel in fighting when using a certain characters. You can choose your party fighting mode too. It makes every fighting not boring.

The battles : Every battle will encourage you to hone your skill in utilizing these character's artes and movement abilities for defeating different types of enemy. I always get an urge to defeat the enemy in a ""beautifull/elegant"" way. Once I do that,  I always get satisfaction feeling after the battle. 

Hard and Unknown/Hardest difficulty level : I find that Hard is the most enjoyable. 

Enemies : The enemies are diverse enough. They have different surprising attack, defense and dodge movement. I usually lose at the first battle just to get to know how the enemy works. I never get monoton feeling as the game progress. The enemy design and ability also different on each stage of the game story.

Battle, artes Animation, environment or the graphics : Simply beautiful no complain

What i dislike :
The story (main and skit) : I think It lacks of fun or funny or surprise elements in it. Each characters brings his/her own dark past, but some conversation about the past are kinda repetitive or boring. I think the other ""fun/funny"" conversations fail to bring balance to the story nuance. The characters's personalities mostly  ""ordinary"" and many of their conversation actually feels ""common"".  The emotional impact of the story is low. I think it will be better if there are more intra/interpersonal conflict in the story. The relationship progress between the characters were too slow and at the end are not deep. 

The ending : The ending is not satisfying. It feels like there should be more piece in it. I think the story is forced to end too soon. The anticlimax is too short.  Weirdly the fight with the last boss is not long enough to give me good victorious feeling.

The unknown/Hardest difficulty : Just for certain enemy or bosses. The damage dealt is unreasonably low. The battle turn into exhausting effort because it takes too long of time and resources so it is not fun anymore.

1 Very pretty
2 Combat is fast and fun, the learning curve is natural and satisfying. It's been simplified in areas, but the new style does flow better than Berseria's. You can feel very cool at times.
3 It deals with difficult topics well and doesn't pretend it has an answer for everything.
4 Absorbing plot, although unoriginal it's well told. EDIT: Cancel this, I just completed the game. See below.

Cons
1 Did you play Berseria and really enjoy complex, strong, female characters? Tough, Shionne in particular is basically a damsel in distress and nothing more. She rarely even appears in the intra-party banter. She's there to make Alphen look like a more of a hero.
2 After it gets bored of dealing with the complex social issues it dives straight back to save-the-world fantasy stuff, which does feel like a lurch. As mentioned above, it's still absorbing and well told but it feels like a shame. EDIT: Ok, the story melts down into totally standard, unoriginal goop of the worst kind. Alphen becomes an unbearable moron and the writing goes from being ok to just dreadful. The ending is one of the worst I've played in the modern era. Once you get past that it gets fun and lighthearted again.
3 The whole cast are, compared to Berseria, a little dull. I mean that lot were mad but this lot are normal fantasy characters really. Even the intra-party tension feels really quite forced and/or predictable.

Side note: Berseria is my only other Tales experience, hence the constant comparisons. The overwhelming feeling I have is that this lacks a colour, depth and complexity Berseria had in spades. In comparison, this is little more than Lord of the Rings smash cut with The Avengers. EDIT: this last comparison proved to be painfully accurate, in the worst way.

I'd still recommend Arise, but once I've through with them both I'll think back more fondly on Velvet and her gang than Alphen's Personal Power Rangers.

Visually, I'm in awe that that the Tales series has gone from an often generic, unoriginal, and bland look to something that truly is a delight. The landscapes feel original and and makes you feel like you will get a sense of wanderlust..............if you could. There is not an open world map and each location is extremely limited. This is a shame. The towns and cities also feel limited by not being able to go inside buildings unless it's directly involved in the objectives of the story. 

The voice acting is great and the characters have their own charisma.  Most bosses do have plenty of personality, but the last boss feels pretty shallow with little to no motivation why he is the way he is..... other than the game requires a final boss. 

A lot of dialogue is rehashed to the point of annoyance. It's like the game is trying to force the messages down your throat. 

The battling is fun, but I don't recall a jrpg with such a limited enemy list. When you go to new areas it feels like you're fighting the same monsters with a ""new coat of paint"". A lot of times their moves are so similar to previous monsters that you won't really  need to adjust how you fight. 

There is a farming option........but it's pretty meaningless unless you're the type to what to get 100% completion on obscure things. 

The music is perhaps the most enjoyable and memorable that I've heard in any Tales games. 

I know that I've critiqued the game a lot, but it's still worth playing and the overall ending is one of the most satisfying that I've played in a long time.   I would give it a 8.25 out of 10.",1652349069,1652349201,True,0,1,0.480480492115020752,0,True,False,False

For the first few hours you will find it a bit dull with limited combat combos and skills. However when you progress further, the game will naturally become more and more interesting, I suggest you to progress the main story until you find it comfortable to do some combat grinding. Overall aside from its DLCs i really recommend this game. Thank You Bandai Namco!!

PROS:
-Brilliant Well Written Story
-Excellent Combat Skills and Animation
-Good Graphic and Characters Design

For better or for worse, there are a lot of cutscenes, skits, exposition, and etc. that consistently gives the player downplay to simply take in the story and character interactions. Near the end of the main story, I didn't touch the keyboard (except to move forward) for nearly 30 minutes. There were definitely some pacing issues there, but the story overall was still so good. 

I absolutely LOVED getting to know the entire cast of characters, and I really enjoyed doing whatever I could do to trigger more dialogue between the characters. That being said, during the halfway point of the story, I started wondering if I should have just watched ""cinematic movies"" of all the skits and cutscenes combined. But watching those movies isolated without any gameplay behind it does not really fit the emotional stakes behind the fights in my opinion. If you want to experience the story (including the side missions) as deeply as I did, I strongly believe that you need to buy the game and play it yourself. 

You will be able to sink a lot of time into this story, and if you want to get 100% completion, it honestly won't be that hard (probably about 60-65 hours in total). You just need to keep the achievements in mind as you progress through the story, so you won't have to ""cram"" at the end. If you are curious, I am missing one achievement, because the last achievement I have to complete (the 100 weapons achievement) is very tedious, and I'd rather not force myself to play more just for one achievement. 

This is my first time playing a game from the Tales franchise, so I'm definitely interested in the rest of the franchise. This was a very fun experience, and I truly believe that I will fondly think of this game as a ""classic"" as I grow older. For now, I will just have to endure the post-game depression that accompanies all amazing games that I finish.

After giving the Tales series multiple attempts through the years I finally find one that I tolerate enough to complete and honestly this franchise is not for me.

The combat is great... until it isn't and is reduced to spamming the same artes over and over until the massive health bar of the monsters is depleted cause by the end of the game most monsters are immune to the finisher combo move.

The character interactions are great... until they are not, I do not care about half the glorified filler they have to say, especially when it does not even drive forward their already basic relationships.

The game itself is somewhat linear. It doesn't have a sprawling open world, but that is something that can be good or bad. For me it's good. Not every RPGs need vast open world, worse if that open world is boring and empty. There is enough exploration and things to collect. Materials such as minerals and ingredients or herbs are readily available and waiting to be picked, chests to open, etc. I do think, though, that this can be expanded more. The linearity is also somewhat limiting, and I hope future Tales game can be improved in the exploration and collection aspect.

The story is the weakest aspect of this game. I know that Tales game isn't known for the depth of the story, but this is something I think the developers and world builders of this series need to address and improve upon. The story isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about. I do like the romance in it. Bite me.

The strongest point of the game is the combat mechanic. Tales series have developed its mechanic since the Phantasia era up until now, for me personally, in a good direction. I like the combat. It is not difficult, but looking at the Youtube videos how people string combos not only on one character, but on multiple members of the party, there is a lot of depth and complexity to be explored, combat-wise. There is even an arena where you can practice each members' combat method and combo strings. In this aspect, characters are diverse enough in how they operate in battles with respective strengths and weaknesses. I just don't like how now the bosses or the gigant monsters are just immune to break, and they cannot be staggered. IMHO they should be HARDER to break, but not immune as it really takes away some of the fun, especially those with wide area and high damage attacks. But it's not a major issue, just a personal gripe I have.

Concerning the DLC, yes, it is a disappointment. It really breaks the game on how some DLC downright gives exp boost, SP boost, even locking some skills behind them. It makes the game a lot easier if applied. I really hope this is not going to be the norm for future Tales games. 

Performance-wise, there are hiccups and frame drops even on my GTX 1080 at 1440p. The draw distance and popping out is also an issue. But it is not something game breaking.

I'm not a fan of anime type of game, but all those crispy voice acting (especially playing in Japanese Dub), graphic presentations, and character models those are the elements good enough to suck me in for over 60+hrs(will continue for sure). Probably not a GOTY material, but no doubt easily one of my favorite games of all times since Elden Ring.
Let's sum what are the positive notes on this game:
1. Story is OKAY for this kind of genre, typical JRPG game with medieval background setting. 
2. Graphical presentation is acceptable, I'm not sure I am a fan for water-coloring style but there are some captivating moments especially each town has it own respective scenery that stands out on its own. 
3. Combats are intense, enemies (normal difficulties, semi-boss and bosses) are quite aggressive and would one-shot you if careless, always keep an eye of CP, healing and revive items ALL THE TIMEEE.( and also keep at least one medic member in your team to do the healing). Overall it's challenging with reasonable scale,just play carefully and always be ready for each battle especially boss fight.
4. Dialogues feel alive and also funny between party members, there are moments of cute interactions between heroes and  heroines always put me into smile.

However, there are some ANNOYANCES that need to be addressed 
1. Side quests,  seriously there are no indication of minimal level required to take the quests. It turns out encountering over-leveled monsters most of the time, and force to restart my progress again. 
2. Costumes and other cosmetic stuffs, I don't really care they are DLC. But the PERKS & SKILLS!!! why all lock behind the paywall?
3.Combat system is complicated for sure, especially this is your first time playing Tales game. You certainly need some time to digest how the battle system works. My main issue is that, there are no clips/animation of skills,which are important for decision making when you want to choose which skills to unlock and allocate your points to. They only offer simple description that sometime left confusion. So we can't see how the skill does unless you experiment it during battle. It could be improved if they follow suit Final Fantasy 7 Remake, on displaying attack animation of the skill.

Overall it is a good game, highly recommended. Just that there are some parts need to be improved.  DLC should only be allowed for future contents, AND NOT in-game ready items. If not, it would be a perfect game.",1651732948,1651732987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphic of this game is no doubt one of the bests in the JRPG category, sadly the story telling is plain as you ordered a Mcdonald burger without any topping and sauces, though I didn't skip any team conversations (which is one the most important part of this series and it's suppose to give characters more personality), the character roles in this game are still way too plain and ordinary(boring), it's like giving you a cup of water with your plain bun and patty so at least you won't choke yourself to death when trying to swallow.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of JRPG games, spent 800hrs on Fire Emblem: Three Houses, 200 hrs on Dragon Quest XI and countless time on more others, it's sad that I have to say with a beautiful graphic like this game it has a to be honest really bad story telling and boring character roles, I literally had to force myself keep playing till 10 hours to see if things were going better, but it didn't, the story and character role of this game is obviously wrote for your junior high school nephew.

- Good story telling
- Amazing world design
- Decent character development

What Tales of Arise does wrong:
- Clunky combat system
- Spongy enemies (absurdly spongy, why have a regular combo if it doesn't even do any real damage?)
- Absolute unit of bosses that're extremely tank


If you want to enjoy the story just use the C Engine and give yourself boosted combo damage. It's ridiculous for how much effort you have to put in for little payback with this combat system.

Was able to 100% in about 70+ hours on the hard difficulty.
The game really shines with the very customizable combat system. Even the ai is customizable so you can kinda control what they do without needing to switch to them.
Post-game content felt short and the dlc (looking at the sao collab) was meh.
This game really scratched my jrpg itch, I give it an 7.5/10. Would've been higher but the ending felt rushed and there was still some things that left me with questions.
If you're looking to tryout a single-player jrpg and to just throw your life away for about week, this game is for you.

tl;dr: Music was great, story was mediocre but engaging, the combat system is fun to mess around with so you can tryout different combos, and cool monster designs.

It's filled with so many tropes and cliches, while not entirely bad in their own rights it's done terribly in this game. All while following the story, it felt like they had given a writer basic outlines of what points they need to hit in a story and then the writer hurriedly tries to tie those outlines together. This gave rise to moments where characters will say dialogue that is completely out-of-character for them. The amount of plot convenience that happens in this game is also a terrible point, not to mention how spinelessly anime the characters are to just stand there and let bad things happen two feet in front of them. If the game wants the player to believe the characters are helpless to act in certain situations, how about ACTUALLY adding those in-game elements that are the supposed obstacles. It's all a bunch of ""I can't do anything because PLOT,"" which is really annoying. Save your time, no amount of repetitive gameplay and mill-of-the-road graphics will save such a mediocre story.

As a side note, if you're looking to play this game just because ufotable animated some of the cutscenes in this game, don't bother.

The second half of the game is not good, though. Everything is done wrong: The story becomes too convoluted for its own good, the gameplay becomes stale because the enemies are just the same but with insane amounts of HP, new mechanics stop and you're left just repeating the same move ad nauseam until you complete the unnecessarily long fights, the characters end up feeling one dimensional and start feeling cartoonish. 3/10 at most.

The game took 55 hours to complete, doing quite a few side quests, and it honestly felt at least 20 hours too long. At one point I just wanted to finish the game and I felt like quitting more than once. The first couple of main bosses are the peak difficulty of the game, and once you learn how to manage your inventory, the game feels easy, but still a chore due to the lenght of the battles and the artificial difficulty on your enemies' HP pools.

EDIT;
after finishing this game i can give it 9.5/10 based on everything done and seen.
 
visuals like always in tales of franchise are amazing and areas are inviting you to explore them

a  majority of gameplay can be cut down by fast travel,wich is honestly something good AND BAD in tales of Arise 'specifically',because there are times when you finish something and you simply fast travel to turn the quest in possibly missing skits,owls etc. The characters react on the world and the things that are happening around them,example if you stand near a fire in Calaglia they will shield themselves from the heat ,shionne for example will complain about it,falling from a height ,jumping into water from a height,reacting on enemies and points of interest etc.

as for the story,if youve ever played a ''tales of'' you know youre about to dive into a clusterfuck of plot twists and character development but in tales of Arise it was kind of...lacking in its way of revealing the story to you it didnt feel like some great mistery at all and as far as ive seen this title in the franchise doesnt predate or post date any of the other tales of games  wich opens up for a sequel no? already rained on the parade,there wont be one.

combat is almost all top notch but compared to the previous games like zestiria and berseria it is missing some stuff like dual M.A's(mystic artes/hi-ougi),chaining combat skills like in zestiria and berseria(for example if this game had this you could open a pannel and bind not a skill to a button but an entire combo wich still requires YOU to pay attention and trigger it correctly) and some stuff like evolving arte through the profficiency which in this game serves purely as a dmg boost to the skill. and keeping up the gauge(or just filling it by using Happy Bottles) is pointless as it doesnt really widen the fights,the ''meeting rarer monsters more often'' is a half truth because this occurs ONCE in the entire gameplay and it is when you first unlock it.

NG+ should give you new quests and stuff however i personally havent noticed any(and i just started Viscint chapter now) and the ''play records'' still say 70/70 subquests. this is for me personally  a BIG DISSAPOINT because continuing a NG+ would usually alow you to change the flow of the story,end it differently or even EARLY with other outcomes(like you can doom the world in zestiria). in this game it felt like NG+ serves the purpose of going back and rediscovering all of the owl and skits but nothing else wich is kind of fruitless as the already discovered owls(the attachments they provide do if youve discovered the specific artifact) DO NOT transfter with you and you can find them all on the first playthru quite easily. 

the skits are mostly fun and there are plenty of them,some are missable but all can be viewed again at the campfire whenever you want wich means that YOU DONT HAVE TO SIT YOUR WHINYBITCHASS THRU THEM every time they pop up,skip them if you want. 

the main reason why i am not giving it 10/10 is exactly because of the lack of dual mystic artes and NG+ being basically the same thing with nothing new except you can one shot everything. this might seem silly but it truly truly is not as in every tales games a dual mystic arte reffers to the BOND the characters have developed,how the story shaped them and how theyve changed their view on one another.

There was pretty good plot twists here and there but its just not enough to make me feel satisfied on the ending. Also, Volhran goal is a good addition to the story but the way they portray it in the story is not good or cannot be easily understood.

Battle System was amazing, it was fast-paced and very flashy. Very good execution to welcome new people into the franchise. My only complain is locking players on arte's animation. I don't understand why they do this. In old tale games you can animation cancel by blocking, there are even mechanicson some tales where you do guard cancel to extend your combo. This must be an attempt to reduce abuse on this mechanic but there should be other ways of doing it. Who was the person responsible for locking animation? I hope he will not be involve on the next title.

There are also DLC Costumes which has titles/artes on them. You don't really need those to complete the game. I only buy the one with Azure Storm Skill for Alphen because it has short animation. I might get everything else too in the future but if you want to buy DLC just for the skill, I highly recommend Beach Time Triple Pack(Male) DLC.

Good:
The game is good. Gameplay, combat, graphics, controls, fast travel, etc.
The side quests are mostly kill a monster and report back but the game is so good I did not mind doing all of them. Some of the side quest's plot is better than the main plot. 
The extra comic panel dialog they do should be bad but it isn't. i watched all of them.
I liked 4 out of 7 main cast character tropes 
I love the politics. Wanting to change the system is usually the villain's goal so this was nice.

 
Bad:
Main story is the biggest flaw. the low budget comic panel elaborations whenever it happens is nice but the main story itself is uninteresting. weird. 
Every single one of the main cast's diverse back stories is god awful
A ton of relationship advice dialog.. just a bunch of advice flying around in general
The main character and his love interest annoyed me but I like the gun she has
Didn't care for the animated cut scenes 
No way to mark the map (would have been nice sometimes)


Neutral:
So many cut scenes but I dont mind them
Items are EXPENSIVE but you can farm fish for money
Can't control what the other characters are focusing. Everyone doing their own thing.
The dodge roll + counter attack after feels like an overpowered get out of jail free card cheese move, at the same time it's unreliable (might be timing). it's there and i spam it often 
The part of the mid air combo when I try to use a skill to dive downward completely misses the enemy, even the ones that teleports to them. Might be cause my timing idk
Near the end I couldn't tell which attacks came from my allies or enemy.. not a big deal just dodge rolled everything 
The lock-on is soft. I combo pass the enemy to combo the air 
The owls.
They reskin the same enemies from start to end. Some enemies might have like 10 different variations, even boss fights 
Being able to set the difficulty level.. i dont like it but never really think about it

Pros:

Great voice acting.  Great graphics, animations, special FX, cinema.  The anime quality DID take a nosedive but there are more of them.
Combat is slightly improved over ""spam everything"" but during the endgame it kinda just devolves back to ... ""spam everything""
Music also isn't bad and the environments are varied
You can tell where 90% of the budget went.  Visuals and graphics.  All style, no substance.

Cons:

Pretty much everything else. 
The difficulty is a joke

The characters are hilariously bad and contradictory all the time
I see some of these Reddit clowns defending Shionne's personality but it's just so cringe to me.  One moment its ""Oh Alphen I must protect you!"" Alphen responds ""Yes Shionne! I must protect you too!"" 
THEN LITERALLY ONE SCREEN AWAY the conversation goes like this
Shionne ""Alphen I don't give a f*** about you I'm only here for business!!!""
Alphen: O_O

The story is terrible.  HURR DURR KILL THE FIRE GUY, THE ICE GUY, THE EARTH GUY AND THE WATER LADY.  That takes like 70% of the story.  After all that it ACTUALLY gets interesting for around 46 minutes (I legit timed it) then it's back to OMG we all have to protect each other and kill the baddies!

The big bad ended up being a giga generic moustache twizzling villain like ""BUAHAHA IT WAS MEEEEEE THE WHOLE TIME""
I rolled my eyes so hard they almost fell out of my head

WAY WAY WAY too much exposition.  I can only hear Rinwell repeat her ""i'm trying to be a less angry teen"" speech so many times holy sh**

The new skits are terrible.  I agree the old ones had to go but these new ones are not the move.  I just hate everything about them.  Their presentation, the layout, all of it.

The also P2W part of the game.  Very cringe.  Want Dohalim to be a competent healer?  Guess what you have to pay up to get the ""Titles"" that gives him access to the spells to do so.... WTF??????

Want money to actually play the game?  here's 200,000 gald (or however much it is) never worry about actually playing the game!  That also applies to the crafting and gathering holy shit I was browsing the reviews and this wasn't mentioned once.  How?  It's anti consumer

Between the forgettable characters, the slog of a terrible story.  The P2W aspects and the piss poor writing I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anybody.

What happened to all the cool tropes?  Where's the ""old man"" of the team like Kratos (Symphonia), Raven(Vesperia) Malik (Graces)?  Where's my quirky scientist?  Rita Mordio (Vesperia) Pascal (Graces) Raine (symphonia) the list goes on and on

The game was ok, I finished it  about 34 hours, I'd say about 20 of that is actually story and not me going back to do side quest subtract all the skits and cut-scenes and you've got about 17 hours of game here. I would say unless your a hardcore completionist there is no reason to seek out the devil arms as there is no post game campaign like Tales of Graces f had and that saddens me. Though it borrows a lot of ideas from Graces with the planets and stealing the energy, it just doesn't do it in the right way that would justify multiple runs. Crafting isn't really needed what so ever as the game more or less gives you better weapons and occasionally accessories when you need them.  The story was basic and the characters kept switch moods rather vapidly.  If it weren't for all the action and violence I'd give this game an E10+ rating its barley has anything in it worth a T rating. 

I really enjoyed the combat flow, music and art design of this game, but usually that alone doesn't save a game.  
If your a Tales fanatic like me or just enjoy the tedium of grinding then pick up the game, otherwise watch a lets play and then decide for yourself.

This game made me forget that I ever cared about that :). Maybe it will smash some boundaries for me with enjoying other jrpgs. The story is fantastic and engrossing with a much more mature take on collectivism vs individualism than anything you'll find in modern US society (I hope other countries are fairing better than us). The characters are all fantastically well written through out and have arcs I care about. The game has somewhat predictable arcs, but not in a bad way. They are predictable because the themes are so strong and consistent, not because the story has no creativity or heart.

I have tried to get into tales in the past, but despite enjoying the gameplay loop and presentation, I really struggled with how bland the environments were that you played in. I've never considered myself a graphics guy, but old Tales games made me realize I do need interesting level design and some aesthetic flair to really invest, and Tales of Arise fixes this issue with prior tales games many times over.

Story:
While not painful to sit through, the story plays out a bit too predictably. Perhaps I've just played too many JRPGs at this point, but the major plot points seemed like very tired cliches. Hero meets Heroine, goes on to gather an unlikely band of misfits in order to overthrow the big bad. Though there's a couple of (still predictable) twists, the game really doesn't deviate from this path at any point. It was interesting enough to finish, but almost through the whole game I was waiting for something more to give the world a bit more life.
That said, they did chop up each section into smaller pretty well isolated stories. While the main story was luke warm, the smaller stories varied a bit more. Most were still a little tiring, but if there's anything I'll look back fondly on with this game it would be the ""Earth"" sector. Without giving anything away, it was by far the most touching story in this anthology.
Generally, bonus points to the initial premise of the story. Not a lot of games stick to the themes of slavery and freedom and, while a better story could have been told, it was a generally good premise.

Gameplay:
The combat is above average as far as Tales games go, though perhaps a little under ambitious. While other titles have gotten clunky with either too much going on or just failing to find a good rhythm, Tales Of Arise's combat really flows. The only downside is that by about the half way point I found a handful of moves that became my toolset for the rest of the game. Combat at this point has gotten a bit dull, and even on Hard difficulty at an appropriate level the final boss ultimately became a cakewalk. This title drops some of the more nuanced aspects that encourage variety such as bonus damage from combos. About the only reason I found to get a 100+ hit combo was for the achievement attached to it, otherwise it was a mix of a single slow but powerful attack for large enemies or rapid hits to trigger an insta-kill on small enemies.
As for gear, it's all very straight forward. Defeat monsters, get materials, craft weapons. Armor is found strewn about in usually obvious places. Rare drops are just *slightly* rarer materials, but when you only need a handful you're likely going to get them naturally along the way anyway. Perhaps I'm just oldschool, but I enjoy a bit of hard-to-get loot in my questing. The accessory system isn't too bad, but really doesn't open up until the end of the game. I will say though, the addition of some interesting perks in random rolls does add some neat variety to the system.
The global CP system can be frustrating at times by limiting how much you can heal between rests, but adds a layer of challenge and helps encourage you to keep moving.
As is customary in modern Tales games all combat is initiated through contact with creatures in the overworld. This allows you to sneak by or thin them out if you want which really helps if you're low on health or in a rush.
The fishing is fun though. I happily spent a lot of time fishing.

Environment:
The world you traverse is about as generic as it comes. Fire kingdom with fire, earth kingdom with forests, water kingdom with lakes, air kingdom with... well, just kind of a generic landscape but the characters let you know it's very windy.
Though not an eyesore, there's also no real stunning locations in the game. One optional area comes to mind where you swim through a crystal cave, but otherwise you're pretty much going through the paces of a fantasy JRPG world.
There's also a complete lack of charming side-story areas like Katz Corner. About the only ""charm"" point was the obligatory hot spring which amounted to two cut scenes and then never to be seen again. The one optional spot to visit? A deserted island that is just that. A boring deserted island.

Characters:
This was the true disappointment in Arise. While no one is offensively bad, there is almost no growth in the main characters. The heroine eventually warms up to the hero and one of the characters has a gradual change of heart about one of the main themes of the game. Even with that tiny growth though, by the end everyone pretty much fits into the classic make up; The stoic hero, the compassionate heroine, the cute one, the obnoxious one, the sagely one and the aloof one (Doh kind of fits that last one and kind of doesn't... he doesn't have much growth, but his character trait isn't quite as overused as the others.)
Ultimately I was looking for more. Many tales games have you do sidequests that unveil more backstory for the characters which I always loved, but most of it here boils down to a few conversations around ""that one traumatic moment I had"". Not terrible, just mediocre in a franchise that often nails Characters.

The fashion:
If you're a fan of the Tales franchise you'll understand why this must be here. Sadly this isn't unique to Arise; I'm pretty sure Abyss was the last game to have a robust wardrobe, but at the end of the game there are basically 1-3 non-gag outfits depending on the character, then several recolors of said outfits. It used to be that you'd have a wide variety to choose from, mostly earned from side quests, but Arise, like other modern entries, seems to have limited the outfits in favor of pushing DLC. Not that I feel that DLC is much better; especially when it lacks the story element that used to be attached to bonus outfits.

I wouldn't really say this is a game to avoid, but this was far from the best that the Tales series has to offer. Mechanically sound, but more often dull than not. I finished the game mostly on the premise that when I realized it wasn't going to get any more interesting I already seemed to be near the end. That and the ability to avoid combat or turn on auto-combat when I wasn't feeling up to grinding through a dungeon.

edit: OK. I'm at the end game now.  I still enjoy this game, but a few gripes: 

1) CUTSCENES: Waaaaayyyy TOO MUCH cutscenes and TALKING. Nearing to the end game, the amount of cutscenes was too much that most of the time i ended up just watching the game than actually playing it. And i don't mean a little cutscene, i'm talking about HOURS worth of cutscenes.  And it dragss.. by A LOT.  There was so many times i thought to myself ""yeap.. i definitely could explain that shorter, rather than repeating the same thing again and again"".  There were parts where after watching a cutscene, you walked a few paces, and then.. ANOTHER CUTSCENE! only to walk a few more steps.. FOR ANOTHER CUTSCENE?!  It was so much that i almost ended up not even bothering to play the game anymore. I'd rather not reach the end game if it was going to be that boring to reach it.

2) RUSHED CLOSURE: My disappointment to the game is the same to most TV series that was hyped.  It starts of good, but failed to end gracefully.  If you played this game midway through, by now you'd realize that the plot keeps adding up. That in itself is not bad.. except at the end, they had to explain all those plots somehow, and ended up rushing it.  So the endgame looks like this long movie where you just watch a lot of people talking and explaining everything.  Hence my gripe no 1) above.  Suddenly it feels like you're just bombarded with so much information as the game tries to close out every main plot they introduced in the game.  In the end, going through the end game gave you this feeling of fatigue as you try to catch up to every little explanation.",1648954545,1649494397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I daresay it's the prettiest game of 2021 TBH. The overall plot is cool and interesting and characters are cool in that they match their archetypes and designs but that's about where it ends. 

The game like most JRPG's has really rushed character development where someone's motives can change from point A to B with nothing in-between to cause said growth. Enemies are reused just with different elements or slightly different attacks(although there are still unique enemies don't get me wrong). If it matters to you as well the variation in combat comes from you picking who you want from your party in the squad, not quite choosing a weapons playstyle per characters.

3. Combat that was basically only good thing in the game was not able to carry over 50 hours of the game became to dull and repetitive and i tried out all the characters throughout the game and that was the only thing that helped it because if you were to only play one of the characters for combat it would be painful.

Pro: Graphics were good enough with interesting landscape but then in some areas I would look at places you should only spend 15 seconds in and look at the detail that went into some areas that had nothing to do what so ever and go why didn't they put some of the money they dumped into decent writing and story development.",1649442631,1649442631,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b] The Good: [/b]
- The characters, art, and zones are pretty and great to look at.  The engine looks wonderful.

- The music is excellent.

- The character direction and voice acting is pretty good.  No real complaints with the six playable characters... or the villains.

- Hootle.

[b] The OK: [/b]
- The Combat system is fun at first, but starts to drag near the end of the game when enemies start to have piles of hit points.  Your strategy from the beginning of the game in combat doesn't really evolve much, so you'll end the game doing the same sort of combat you began the game with.

- The entire time I played this game, the pacing felt strangely off.  I never skipped a battle and did almost all of the side quests... and I still ended up several levels below the final dungeon's monsters.  Another example of weird pacing is the game's first side quest being against a monster forty levels higher than you.  I went through like 75% of the game before I finally could go back to the starting area and do my first side quest.  It felt very strange, and this persisted for most of the game where side quests had strange levels.

[b] The Not So Great [/b]
- The cutscenes/skits ranged from okay to downright snooze-inducing.  I've never played a game where there were so many skits to say absolutely nothing.  Yes, we get it, Shionne really loves to eat.  At about the halfway point, I ended up actively cringing every time I saw a skit appear because they were just so dull 95% of the time.

- The game is quite the slog when it comes to combat.  This is compounded by the fact there are really only a handful of different enemy types that get reused over and over.  You'll begin the game fighting wolves, and you'll end the game fighting slightly buffer red wolves.

- Combat wouldn't feel quite so sluggish except for the fact that most of the cinematic artes and break attacks don't change for the entire game.  I kept waiting for a skill panel to unlock that would upgrade some of my break attacks to not just be the same thing I've been using since the beginning of the game... but alas there was none to be found.  It would have been nice if they replaced them periodically throughout the game so that every encounter I'm not watching Alphen use Flaming Swing or Law use Thundery Tenebrus Claw.

[b] Verdict: [/b]
In the end, I'm glad I played the game, but I was quite ready for it to be over at about 50 hours.  There are some side quests still available for me to do, but I have little desire to pursue them because I am just so burnt out on the combat at this point.  I tentatively recommend the game, but only for folks with a lot of patience to slog through slower-paced skits and people willing to grind levels.",1649224179,1649224216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it doesn't break new ground in the world of action RPGs, it perfects the formula that the franchise has been building for several generations, and is a standout in the genre. For fans of the Tales series, this is absolutely a must-play, up there with Symphonia and Abyss as a pinnacle of the series. For JRPG fans, it's highly recommended, providing the comfortable familiarity of the genre with a wonderful coat of polish and plenty to sink your teeth into. For the average gamer curious about the Tales franchise, this is a great place to start, but understand that grit and realism are set aside for a purely anime experience. If you like action RPGs with plenty of plot, dialogue, and gorgeous environments, this will be for you. If typical JRPGs aren't your fare, you may want to pass.

Pros:
+Excellent, action based combat that relies on strategy as much as reflexes. Easy to learn, difficult to master, but rewarding all the way through the game.
+Beautiful, lively environments full of detail with plenty to engage with. At no point does any field or dungeon feel empty, everything is vibrant with plenty to do.
+Excellent, challenging boss battles that test the player's familiarity with the battle system.
+Well crafted characters that are fun to get to know and watch grow over the course of the game. Well acted and well modeled, breathing life into them.
+Top notch voice acting both in cutscenes and exploration that lends a lot to making the characters and world feel alive and dynamic.
+Plenty to do between story missions, with sidequests being fun challenges that add more to the plot.

Cons:
-Linear and somewhat predictable, if you're familiar with the conventions of JRPG stories. Well crafted, but nothing one would consider groundbreaking.
-Gameplay loop can get repetitive, with a lot of hopping around randomly in the back half of the game to catch sidequests the player may have missed or not been at the right level for earlier.
-No recommended levels for sidequests and optional bosses: in the game, you'll uncover sidequests and take the time to travel to the objective, only for the enemy to be 20 levels above you and will easily wipe your party with absolutely no warning. Game design oversight in my opinion.

Overall, this game is stellar, being exactly what it wants to be. It's a new height for the Tales franchise, a standout in the current generation of JRPGs, even standing up against the likes of FF7R and DQ11, and deserves the critical praise it's received. For lovers of the genre, I can't recommend it enough, and for those curious about the action JRPG world, this is a great place to start. It doesn't break ground, but it perfects what the Tales franchise is. It's anime junk food in terms of plot, but the battles, bosses, and story beats hit the bullseye.

There are character developments and some plot twists. The theme of story was well and carefully portrayed throughout the game. However, the story starts to pale in the final quarter of the game.

Normally I do not play JRPG games and this was overall a great experience. I enjoyed the graphical presentation of this game, characters were well made, and story took a long time to finish. Combat system was good but hard. I did like the story and enjoyed the fights. You traverse the world with your leader (Alphen by default) and travel throughout the world, fight or try to avoid monsters, but once they detect you and caught up to you and start a fight you get into somewhat of an arena. Fight in arena is good, you always have limit of 4 people even when you travel with 6. The extra 2 sometimes can join the fight with their specials once they charge up. Each special has different attributes like interrupting casting or stopping a charge of an enemy. Voice acting is superb in this game and there is a lot of dialog. Unfortunately, you have no selection so its like watching a movie when dialog happens.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Beautiful environment and NPCs
+ Voice acting is superb
+ Story is captivating and well written

[b]Cons[/b]
- No dialog options at all
- Forging and crafting accessories system is primitive
- Unlocking some skills requires completion of silly stuff like fishing or cooking

[h1][b]What I Liked:[/b][/h1]
[b]COMBAT:[/b]
Fast paced, beautiful combat that felt smooth and satisfying

[b]CHARACTER POWERS:[/b]
I enjoyed the other characters, and the fact that you could not only use their special powers but you could actually switch out to them at any time, and select a different primary character

[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:[/b]
On the topic of characters, this game has some SERIOUSLY good character development. It really felt like I was there with the other characters (including my own character) in the story, as their development happened gradually and extremely smoothly.

[b]THE STORY:[/b]
The story, in my opinion, was an absolute masterpiece. I would be lying if I said I didn't tear up a bit near the end of the game. I made it through the full story along with many side quests in about 40 hours - While some may say this is too short it felt just about perfect to me, as there were many cut-scenes during the game that gave you a break to sit back and relax and just enjoy the show.

[h1][b]What I Disliked:[/b][/h1]
[b]END-GAME COMBAT:[/b]
Towards the end of the game, the combat felt extremely tedious. I'd say about 70% of the way through the story, the fights began to drag on for extended periods of time which felt unnecessarily long to the point where I actually started getting bored in the middle of combat. You can only perform so many attacks before a 20 or so minute fight starts to feel this way. 

[i]NOTE: Keep in mind I played on the easiest difficulty, as I had not played many games like this before nor am I usually good at games like these. I'm not sure how much of an effect this may have on the length of combat.[/i]

I actually ended up switching the combat to automatic for the last few hours of the story because I just felt super burnt out on the drawn out fights one after another.


[h1][b]TL;DR:[/b][/h1]
Tales of Arise is a fantastic RPG with a beautifully written story, super flashy combat, and some seriously good character development that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the game. Unfortunately, end-game feels more tedious than fun but this can (potentially) be remedied by selecting a different difficulty or changing how the combat system works through the settings to take some strain off of the player.

The Tales series always has great visuals, gameplay and some out there stories. But by the time I lost interest was about, lets say, the 35% mark. I'd just gotten the full party, was ready to set out on my quest, and I just couldn't be bothered. At that point, the game just wasn't standing out enough and I was just getting tired. At that time I also ended up picking up another game I'd been really wanting to play, so Arise went on the back burner. When I tried to get back into Arise, I found I had forgotten which quests I was suppose to be doing and found the mechanics too confusing and difficult to wrap my head around again. At that point, I just thought, ""do I want to play this, or something else?"" And I picked ""something else.""  Its a fine game, don't get me wrong. But its just the problem with games of this type. You need to power your way through, because things are just going to get more and more complicated as you go, and best of luck trying to figure out every characters moves if you take a break and forget how to fight right before a major boss.
Maybe I'll play it again someday. Who knows. But as is, this is a game for the Tales and Anime fans out there.

If you do like Tales games or anime in general, I think you would have a good time. If you want another game like this though want an easier time with the mechanics, go play Scarlet Nexus.

This is my first Tales game ever so my thoughts might not carry the same context when being unable to compare to other installments of the franchise. That being said, I think this game is very newcomer-friendly in its setup and system. Arise is rather linear in its approach, which I personally don't find a detractor. There are plenty of side-quests to partake in, and due to the quick-travel, largely aren't tedious or exhausting. 

I'm about in the middle when it comes to feelings on crafting systems, but really did enjoy the weapons and accessory crafting in here as well. Lots of items to find, along with other sub-types of collectibles that I didn't have to go TOO out of my way to complete (maybe 2-3 hours of extra time to find missing things or things not available until late game). I have to say that I am only a completionist for games that really grab me, and this did end up being one of those. 

The voice acting in both Japanese and English were lovely — though I did feel some choices in translation for certain plot-scenes slightly changed the context of either what was said or how a character felt (Kisara's 'moment', for ex) but nothing that severely detracted from enjoyment. The graphics and art design I loved as well and while areas aren't super huge, I enjoyed taking a look at all the environments around me and found the thematic design of the main towns to be neat. (Though is it just me, or making the world a touch larger and providing the potential of having zeugles as mounts would have been awesome?? Just me? Quite possibly. Law on a wolf zeugle mount just sounds cool, I'm sorry lol) 

The soundtrack is beautiful, and I am a huge sucker for fantasy genre OSTs in general. If they ever release it on a vinyl set, I'm there. Sometimes if I needed to step away from my computer, it was nice leaving the music of certain places playing in the BG while I putz'd away with something nearby.

As for a couple con-crits: I wish they utilized the special ""in dungeon"" abilities of the main cast more for the overworld. I thought it was really neat how, for example, Rinwell could store away magic from barriers or Kisara could use her shield form to blow away noxious areas so the party could pass. Not that I don't get it because Alphen and Shionne are the main-main characters, but I felt like theirs were the only ones that got decent use. Felt like they could have done much more with the others outside of little bits in 'their' plot dungeon. 

Same with the Boost pair finishers, would have been cool if each pair had more than one or if the dialogue varied a touch depending on where in the plot the story is. Or heck having some side quests that focused on the main six bonding between each other a little more deeply at certain points, which then their pair attack would ""upgrade"" and add a second sequence that would be random in battle (or had certain requisites to use). How cool would it have been to have Dohalim (or Shionne) and Rinwell, for example, to have one pair attack for when things are still 'tense' plot-wise, but then once things advanced and maybe you did a side quest with the two, they would officially have a ""bond moment"" and then their pair attack would upgrade. 

Maybe this is my saying I wish there was a little more interpersonal bonding in the group overall instead of just Alphen kinda-sorta getting them with bonfire convos? Who knows. I don't think it's THAT much of a detriment of course, but I guess I liked the characters a lot but also felt they had some missing potential in their developments. This might also be because I actually loved the side characters quite a bit more than the main couple (A/S are fine, don't get me wrong) and wanted to see more out of them outside their ""lol quirky"" tropes. Law and Rinwell somewhat got some good bits in there, but Dohalim and Kisara — for who they are and what they came from — could have gone so much farther than they did. Some side quests helped, but I wanted more main story additions too.

Three paragraphs might seem like a lot, but they by no means were deal-breakers for me. I clearly love this game to death (esp considering this is my first Steam review) and am finishing up my second playthrough and will be doing a third on the hardest difficulty. Maybe my crits are just quirks of the Tales series in general or maybe my jive isn't the targeted jive, who knows? Maybe it's more simplistic writing at play, I don't know. These are just my thoughts on it all.

I stand by my opinion that I think this is a great game, regardless of the small crits I have or the swinging opinion from launch until now (which I'm only vaguely aware of). Simple? Sure, yeah. But fun? Definitely.",1648926578,1648926578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bearing that in mind there are points in the story where progress can abruptly come to a halt if you havent done side quests, due to lack of level. 

Really the best part of this game is the character interactions. Each character has a well fleshed out development arc, and an intricate personality that is put on display with the other cast members. Without going into too much detail I will say that they all work really well together.

The tales of Franchise has been going around for the past two decades now in fact the release of Tales of Arise marks the 25th anniversary of the franchise, from being an Indie Japan only franchise to a worldwide sensation it has come a long way, and they couldn’t have done it better with the release of Tales of Arise, totally redefining the franchise for the better good and yet keeping that enthusiastically optimistic JRPG essence throughout, this game pays homage to its entire predecessors while setting the road up for its successors, this might be in my honest opinion the Best Tales of Game. 

			[h2][b][u]About Tales of Arise[/u][/b][/h2]
Tales of Arise is an Action Role Playing Game, Developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Part of the Larger Tales of Franchise, it is the 17th Main Entry in the Larger Tales of Franchise, it was originally slated to be released in 2020 but due to Pandemic and other factors was subsequently delayed. Built upon The Beautiful Unreal Engine 4, the Game looks real pretty. 

			[h1][b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b][/h1]
			[b]First Impressions[/b]
The Game had an easy to configure settings tab, which is a plus point in my book, before actually diving into the game. The way the game began was an instant hooker, we learn a lot of info enough to proceed ahead, but not too much to overwhelm a new player which is good. Followed by Gorgeous Cut Scenes, the actual game begins after an hour later and damn I couldn’t keep my controller down until it eventually ran out of juice. 

			[b] Exploration [/b] 
They have quest markers in the mini-map, it is very clear where to go and what to do. NPCs also have the checkmark above their head to indicate that you have already talked to them before. There is a fast travel/waypoint system so you don't have to walk. The game rewards you to do exploration for good gear and items. I managed to get some very awesome items by exploring as much as I could on each map. The game also has an interesting cooking system that gives a lot of good buffs and a campfire to restore HP/CP. Fishing was also a fun activity to do while exploring the maps. The exploration was well done. 

			[b] Combat [/b] 
Combat is Redefined in Tales of Arise unlike the previous titles, it isn’t too technical nor is it hard to execute, it's as beginner-friendly as it gets, and that’s a really good sign from my side. All of our party members are unique and are fun to play with, each equipped with their moves and character skill customization maps was something, no character comes off boring. The only downside of the combat would be the ridiculous AI, our party members target monsters at random, which is annoying at higher levels, since there are monsters with higher health pools and that makes it less immersive but overall though really fun combat. 

			[b] Quests [/b] 
Doing the side quests gave very good rewards and did not feel like a chore to me. The biggest problem that I have is that there was no recommended level for the side quests. It happens very often that you are let's say lv 20. The side quests tell you to kill an elite monster, and it turns out this monster is lv 30+, which is impossible for you to complete right now. So yea a recommended level requirement could have solved that, but I guess they wanted us to dive completely unknown to get the full experience. 

			[b] World and Design [/b] 
The world is really beautiful, and when I mean beautiful I mean it, you wouldn’t get this kinda prettiness in any other JRPG at the moment, sure finding something beautiful is subjective but damn you wouldn’t resist agreeing on me over here. The character designs are unique, there is no one you could hate based on their designs, the monster designs are really unique and well made. Overall you won’t be bored staring at Kisara’s ass all day nor you would be while exploring Elde Menancia hehe. 

			[b] Story [/b] 
The story was pretty decent for a JRPG, but that also ties in with your tastes as for me I really enjoyed what it had to offer, really strong points and stuff to ponder about, the freedom theme goes well with the recent events we have been seen throughout the globe. The story has something for everyone, and I would suggest you go in blind without much looking up online since that’s the most optimal way to enjoy it. 
		
			[b]Music[/b]
The music in tales of Arise is amazing, depending upon the situation it is well composed, and makes a player immerse itself completely in this world. The music is also soothing at times it's just sad, and at times victorious, depending on what the player is going through the overall tone of the music in this game, helps out in drawing raw emotions which elevates the experience. 

			[b]Graphics[/b]
The Graphics are phenomenal, a generational leap if I would have to say, the new engine helps with this drastic jump. The world feels so alive, it feels like it's painted through handpiece by piece, using watercolors to make it look so good. The grass, the scenery, the cattle, the people, they feel so breathtakingly alive it's hard to comprehend and compress those into mere words. TL: DR the graphics are high quality and good. 
			[b]Dungeons [/b]
 Very small puzzles and easily doable without using a walkthrough. I think it was fun to explore all the rooms to get good items and gear. And also to retrieve key items to proceed within the dungeons. The dungeons reward you for exploring, they aren’t too difficult to master even for novices, yes there is always a very large monster at the very end of the dungeon but if you played your cards right shouldn’t even be a hurdle, long story short decent dungeon design, though expected some complex ones. 

			[h1][b][u]PROS[/u][/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] world Feels alive and graphics are breathtaking.
[*] well-written characters and the plot is easy to follow and decent enough to entertain.
[*] combat isn’t convoluted, well sorted out, and easy enough to master.
[*] Good music and Side activities make this game all the worth and effort of your time 
[/list]

			[h1][b][u]CONS[/u][/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] AI is Kinda Dumb, with no single target locking for party members 
[*] Hard mode feels too easy 
[*] Side Quests don’t have recommended levels, so prepare to faint quite often
[/list]

		[h2][b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b][/h2]
Tales of Arise is a massive ice breaker for the franchise with 1 million copies sold in less than a week and it has the highest number of concurrent players for a JRPG over on steam. It’s a directional step up for the franchise, going forward with the same attitude and perseverance will give way for more great games for audiences around the globe, and then people will fondly remember that all was given birth by the meeting of a boy who couldn’t feel pain and a girl who would inflict pain to anyone who gets too close. Their story and adventures will always be the mother of the new tales franchise in the distant future.",1632833438,1648409867,True,1,0,0.495495468378067017,0,True,False,False

Story: The story for Tales of Arise is amazing it has twists and turns and even though I played this game a while ago I still remember the main parts of the story. The character where likable and you could relate to them and the struggles they are going through. I would easily give the story a 7.5 out of 10

Game play: The game play is fun. A lot like Final Fantasy 7 remake. You have a party of NPC's that are on your journey with you. Each NPC has their own role to play story wise and combat wise. The combat is fast passed and satisfying. I would give the game play a 6.9 out of 10.

Pro's: 
Good character/NPC development, Great story, Great combat, beautiful semi open areas to explore, challenging if wanted, character/outfits,weapons asthetically pleasing. Story is passed well and has you wanting to know what will happen next. 

Cons: 
Outfits for characters cost real money (which normally wouldn't be a huge issue but this game is single play and outfits effect your characters in game stats which is stupid). For a game that isn't even online the outfits are super expensive, Enemies re-spawn in an odd way (this one isn't a huge issue but the enemies re spawn to quickly so if you need to make your way back a way you came the enemies will be back which didn't make sense to me since once you complete an area you normally have to back track to leave said area and then have to either fight all the enemies, try to avoid their aggro, or flee from every fight. This got kind of annoying later on in the game.

Conclusion: I would give Tales of Arise a 7.9 out of ten. I had so much fun playing it and for it being shorter than a normal anime I felt like by the end I had just watched a full anime season. I loved each character and could feel their emotions. The story is where this game truly shined for me. I would 100 percent recommend this game.",1648365310,1648365310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your usual tropee fantasy anime with semi cringe writing and endless innuendos(in a game with an age12 rating), scads of plot holes, unexplained questions and an abrupt ending. Like your usual fantasy anime.  

That being said, the game was still enjoyable to play and the characters were likeable enough.  Not much of an open world that I'd like to see RPG's get back to but less linear then some new RPGs.  New game+ as usual with most Bandai games, although I don't really feel much need for it in this game.  The story and outcome with just be 100% the same. Nothing like Code Vein where you have multiple different endings or FF7 where conversation choice can actually effect future events.  Tales of Arise is quite fixed with it's story and doesn't let you do much other then follow a pre-determined path.  They use different types of animation which I found weird, I didn't like it. Almost seemed like they were trying to save money by hand drawing half the cut scenes and only using CG during basic conversation scenes.

Story wasn't quite as good and fleshed out as other tales games like Berseria but the combat was more enjoyable I'd say.  But way too much end game boss grinding.  Still worth a purchase and play if on sale.  Not sure I'd pay the full price for it.

Story was engaging and made you care about the characters and little skits were very well done
Graphics made the world very pretty and unique in many ways. Dessert felt awesome. Tundra felt cool. Castles looks awesome

Really cant say enough about this game. If you like RPG type games at all buy this one.

2 negatives though
1 Some of the story was kinda silly. Typical anime stuff and Im not an anime guy. Like ""How could I have possibly killed those people on accident years ago!!!! Im the worst person EVER!!!!"" Yet we killed like 15 ppl on the way to the second castle
And there are a lot of skits for story. Which really is quite cool and I like all the story. But they would put skit after skit after skit right after a long story part. Multiple times I would have watched story stuff for over an hour and had fought anything. Like shut up, I want to punch something! The skits though were done in a super cool way so there is that

Pro's:
- Story early on is fast paced and explains a lot of the important concepts of the game early on. In my first 20 hours I was hooked on the goal of the adventure and they didn't waste any time jumping the protagonist into the journey.
- Combat is very fluid and has a TON of replayability if you enjoy multiple of the characters available for playing.
- Stat/Gear/Talent system is pretty well done (although the Tales of Berseria/Xillia games had better ones in my opinion).

Con's:
- No co-op what so ever even in an online format ... which is ODD for a game series known for it.
- 
- Story towards the later portion of the game feels full of useless dialog and character building that should have been sprinkeled more early on. It takes your fast paced exciting adventure that should have been wrapped up in 25-30 hours and then drags out to be about 40-50. 
- The monsters shields and HP are so high that a lot of the fights make you feel like your characters abilities have no weight to them.

Best battle system in the series.
Dohalim & Shion are among the best Tales characters.
A JRPG on PC that isn't exclusive to the Epic Games store.
Wholesome Alphen & Shion interactions.

---Cons---
Story is a downgrade from Berseria (wasn't expecting it to be better though).
Third act is rather dull, even though the final battle and ending are epic.
Villains are underdeveloped and among the weakest in the Tales series.

There are also mods for the game that change the combat and enemy balance, as well as add multiplayer. These have the potential to make the game better and might be a good reason to try it out.

The following is an outline of my game experience. Yours may differ based on whether you've played previous entries of the series and, if you have, where you started.

Positive:
[olist]
[*]Looks nice.
[*]Great battle theme.
[*]Every character has their own unique flavour in combat.
[/olist]

Neutral:
[olist]
[*]Typos. A lot of them.
[*]Music outside of battle is grand all the time, even during mundane parts. Leaves an impression early on but may become tiring or forgettable over time, as it did with me.
[*]Characters are rather one dimensional. Some interactions are amusing but generally end up rather tiring as skits are not well spaced out. You will frequently be given several in sequence.
[*]The story moves quickly relative to the world, leaving little opportunity to expand on it. The second arc of the game is an info dump, which some may tolerate. I did not.
[/olist]

Negative:
[olist]
[*]The combat system is combo centric, and yet every enemy has super armour that must first be broken.
[*]The only defensive mechanic is a dodge, except for one character who can block but not dodge.
[*]You cannot cancel artes into dodge/block. Many artes have very long animations.
[*]If your combo drops for any reason, the instant kill gauge empties immediately and super armour is instantly reset. Enemies that you've lifted into the air will drop out of your combo while you're stuck in animation lock.
[*]Getting a perfect dodge grants a counterattack that instantly breaks enemy super armour, but detection for this mechanic only applies if you dodge through hitboxes. If you mistime you will eat all the damage. If you instead go for a positional dodge, you're back to suffering through super armour.
[*]Enemies are designed around the instant kill system, so they have inflated HP pools to compensate.
[*]In addition to the above, the main character is designed to convert HP into damage, further compounding the problem due to enemies being further designed around the numbers he can deal.
[*]Battles usually end up as either a walk in the park as you instant kill from enemy to enemy, or last an extended duration due to aforementioned HP and super armour.
[*]Bosses have permanent super armour. The only way to get an opening is to knock them down with the boost system.
[*]The rate at which you break super armour is based on a stat. Because bosses have permanent super armour, this stat is useless against them while being important against regular enemies.
[*]The instant kill system does not apply to bosses, instead acting as phase transitions. Compare to Vesperia where they dealt a large amount of damage, allowing the mechanic to be a true function against bosses.
[*]Knockdowns stick enemies to the floor, making launchers and lift attacks ineffective. This is only somewhat mitigated against large enemies since you can hit them in the air while they're grounded.
[*]Aforementioned knockdowns are tied to a cooldown-based resource. Additionally, only the main character is capable of inflicting knockdown at all times. Everyone else must fulfill a specific condition. Some of them are fine, while others make fights insufferable without them. Auto-block and auto-dodge (in which you can hit enemies but deal zero damage) are the most egregious.
[*]The above point may sound okay, except that the very same mechanic also functions as a combo extender. The latter function is far more fun, but you're usually punished for using them that way as getting knockdowns and fulfilling the conditions is far more important.
[*]Enemy variety is poor. Be prepared to see the same enemies over the entire game, and bosses turn into regular enemies.
[*]Certain enemies have active frames on their weapon even when the animation is stationary towards the end of the swing, leaving the impression of a lack of polish.
[*]Hidden artes are typically more powerful while being more costly, which is no exception in this game. Some of them, however, have such slow startup that it's impossible to combo with them. See above super armour points.
[*]The AI is dumb as a sack of bricks. The customisation has potential to be good, but the game doesn't give you options that you want. Furthermore, the customisation is party wide. Want your caster to keep distance while the melee characters fight up close? Too bad.
[*]AI party members do not jump. On top of that, you have to use aerial artes to learn more aerial artes. I hope I don't have to explain why this is a problem.
[*]Several significant story bosses resort to repeatedly casting DPS checks that are obnoxious, but not threatening, to the player and serve primarily to wipe out the AI.
[*]Some characters take a very long time to learn aerial artes. Half your artes are tied solely to aerial use.
[*]You get extra arte slots almost halfway through the game. This sucks for casters, who must constantly open the menus for magic if they want to use regular artes.
[*]Anemic gain for character progression points. The majority of it comes from sidequests, making them effectively mandatory (unless you buy the cheating DLC).
[*]Due to above knockdown mechanics, a build investing in skills related to that mechanic is far better than anything else.
[*]Healing is restricted to a party-wide resource, which you can spend in the overworld to open paths and get items (this is sometimes mandatory). However, it simply amounts to wasting your time by making you return to a recovery point to get it back or to use expensive CP recovery items.

To recap the points I enjoyed: extensive and unpredictable story, with lots of voice acting and graphical spectacle. Challenging fights that require constant adaptations to the used skills and strategies. Beautiful and diverse levels.

Then to the less positive sides:
- startup is unnecessarily slow: after 2 splash screens, 4 advertisement screens with the cooperating companies, then a warning about auto save you need to click away, then it loads and starts a video clip that you have to stop, then another screen with 'press any key', before you finally arrive at the main menu and can choose to start playing.
- port to the PC is 'lazy' in that all controller keys are mapped one-on-one to the keyboard, without supporting many of the standard conventions, like 'i' for inventory, and F5/F9 for quick save/load. (There is no quick save at all, but admittedly there is not much need either.) One of the strangest choices is that there is no obvious way to quit or go back to the main menu - you need to use the tab key (for pause, but ESC works just as well for that) and choose the option there. But I often ended up using Alt-F4 to terminate the program hard (making sure there was no auto-save in progress), because going back to the main menu, you have to wait again until the video clip has loaded and starts playing, and then the other superfluous 'press any key to continue' screen before you finally can select that you want to quit.
- replayability is pretty minimal - it plays out like an interactive movie, with lots of conversations (skits) and cut-scenes, alternated with a bit of walking the predefined path, and a lot of extensive fights. You don't get to make any choices that influence the story development. Yes, there are side-quests, but usually only a few, and you sort of need to do all for the skill points rewards. Yes, you can explore freely, but many maps are a straightforward single path through, and you only get one new map to 'explore' at any given time. Yes, you can choose where to put your skill points, but in the end you get more than enough to choose all skills, so you can only vary the order a bit. Yes, there are armors to be found/bought and weapons to be crafted, but these are strictly regulated when they become available, and each one is suitable for exactly one character. Yes, you have six characters, but they are always all there; you can choose with 4 to do fights with, though. The biggest reason I can think of to play again, is to take control of the different characters during the fights, since they all have their own special attacks and skill sets.
- combat is always played in a featureless circular arena, without any chance to use terrain to your advantage, sneak up and backstab, or position yourself advantageously at the start. 
- there are a lot of special moves in combat, which might look spectacular, but when the computer-controlled characters perform them, they interrupt your timing, and you need to re-orient yourself afterward. All that visual spectacle also makes it very hard to see what you are doing, if you are actually hitting an opponent or the damage numbers are from another's attack, if spell effects are friendly (and thereby not damaging) or hostile, etc.
- one very serious downside of every mystic arte and boost strike used, is that it resets the battlefield, cancelling all spells that are being cast/sequenced and those still in effect. In the later games stages this makes the strongest spells almost unusable, especially in you have Law in your party.
- the number of distinct regular monsters is limited, perhaps about 20 types of normal ones. The same models get re-used for stronger variants a number of times, getting a few different color accents and a higher level. Occasionally they get an extra skill. Also rare and boss monsters are re-used, but less so. Per map there are about 4 regular monster types, so you do a lot of similar fights in a row.
- there is so much dialogue that it gets repetitive, and I tend to start clicking through them when the characters for the umptieth time display their few character traits, or rehash all that they don't yet know.
- there are a number of side quests (for defeating unique boss-monsters) that are out-of-level when you get them. With the first one that is made fairly clear, but especially with those in the latter stages of the regular story, you have no way of judging if you are ready for an encounter or not; only the moment you are engaging the level of the opponent(s) is displayed, and then you are stuck in the fight, with the option to flee disabled and no way to reload until the whole party is dead.",1647154357,1647154357,False,7,3,0.491026431322097778,0,True,False,False

Sure, they did tell a small story of what happened after the ""final"" fight, but we they just throw me back into my old save or give me a new game option to pretend like I want to play this game for a second time.

The PC port is decent, not a single crash or glitch in 85 hours, there's been lots of complaints about draw-distance-popping but it barely bothered me and I often would just stop to look around and appreciate the beautiful environments. The music is forgettable but very serviceable and the English voices were great.

The absolutely worst part of the game comes around two thirds into the story when it just goes absolutely crazy with exposition, it takes lengthy cutscenes to ridiculous heights in an effort to mask the fact that the actual final arch is only like 3 dungeons long.

Speaking of dungeons, open world areas included they are super streamlined, nothing new in a Tales I guess, and I never got the feeling of crazy linearity that you may get from other similar games. My guess is that a mix of the environment being carefully hand crafted and beautiful, plus the occasional party banter, skits and the fact that there is almost always some reward for actually paying attention to your surroundings... all that combines to make small and straightforward areas feel really engaging.

This is one of those games where your normal attack does next to nothing and your specials do barely anything other than fill a gauge that lets you actually do decent damage. It's reasonable enough and paying extra attention is pretty rewarding... if you play your resources right and time your inputs well. I played on normal difficulty and again by the last third of the game I felt like they were also artificially padding not just the length of the game but combat difficulty. More and more they start throwing at you enemies with huge health pools that for some reason don't use the good-damage-gauge system so you need to chip them dead. It's just sad when you unleash the main character's ultimate attack and it barely hits for 10% of a normal enemy, at that point I was so sure I was doing something wrong so I looked it up online. Nope, the game just wants dungeons to take longer and to deplete your healing resources and they couldn't figure out a way to do it naturally.

Looking back I wish I bumped down the difficulty to easy for the last third of the game to counter how grindy and damage-spongy it gets, the problem is that story bosses would have been way too easy, there's no perfect solution there... Also again for the last third of the game sidequests become available where the bosses are just too hard, apparently you need to try-hard those by micromanaging all characters and using expensive items...

Side content was generally enjoyable and streamlined which is how I like it. I had fun with this game, that's why I played it for 85 hours and hopefully this review will help you enjoy it a bit more than I did.

I wasn't sure why I veered off the tales series when it's supposed to be one of the spearheader of the jrpg genre. Probably because I had many other options and it became one of those things that you put away in a shelf and you're too lazy to bring it back out, but I decided to give ToA a try due to friends' recommendations and its overwhelmingly positive response. 

I can't say much of the story aspect in this game, it wasn't bad but it's as generic as it can be. Being an anime RPG it also hits all the common tropes that you can think of. The progression is also very predictable and the twists won't surprise you much, especially if you already watched a lot of anime or even any fictions in general.   Boy meets girl, boy gets superpower, girl is strong but can be a damsel when the story demands for it, some guy is ridden with guilt, redemption arc, some girl wants revenge but revenge bad so girl no more revenge but fights for justice, and so on. The characters can be inconsistent too, in one major scene they're all buddies and you'd think it's character development but in the very next scene they revert back to their old personality and flaws before that. All in all it'll probably be frustrating and a bit boring if you have a high standard in storytelling. I'd give the story a 6/10 

On the contrary, the gameplay is what kept me hooked for that whole 50 hours. Battles in this game flows extremely smoothly and are very intuitive, it's 100% enjoyable throughout early game all the way through endgame as you discover new spells and abilities that you can choose to obliterate your enemies in thousands of different ways. All 6 characters in the game are fun to play and their playstyles can be chained together to create even more unique combos. After you finish the game there's an extra quest/post game dungeon that you can do and I certainly wouldn't mind spending another 50 hours there just from the gameplay alone. I gotta give it to Bamco for their designs in action based games. I'll give it a 9.5/10 for gameplay, the 0.5 off being that the party AI could be better. On the highest learning curve where you really want to min max you'll probably going to micromanage your party to the T anyway but I'd still think it'll be better if they can be a bit smarter so you can focus on actually doing the fight instead of keeping your party members from dying to stupid stuff.  

Progression in ToA is exceedingly linear, which can be a pro or con for some. Sidequests are also mostly straightforward. It's either a fetching quests, finding NPCs, fighting mini-bosses, or doing an extra dungeon with a mini boss at the end. They all have markers on the map with fast travels available, you can definitely finish 99% of the sidequests in the game without referring to any guides. 

Overall I'll give Tales of Arise a solid 7.5/10, definitely worth to play but probably wait for at least a 50% discount before buying",1646566032,1646566032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this game with really high expectation because of the hype and how much i loved Tales of Berseria. I was expecting complex characters, interesting character arcs , a good story and great gameplay. Out of all those i only got great gameplay.

[h1] The positives [/h1]

-Tales of Arise has amazing gameplay. 
It's really fun to play with different characters and learn combos. It's even better to see that now you can tell party members when to use their special abilities instead of just having them run around and do what they want when they want. The combination finishers are an absolute treat to look at and i never get tired of using them.

-The weapon and armor progression is MUCH simpler than in Tales of Berseria. 
In Berseria you have to fumble around a LOT before you figure out that just because a piece of armor is dropped by a stronger monster, doesn't mean it's better for every character . Arise takes the simple approach and gives you progressively stronger equipment, so you always know that if you buy or craft the more expensive equipment it will ALWAYS be better that the cheaper equipment.

-The camp fires are a nice addition that give a bit more depth to characters and the cooking cinematics are also nice to see.


[h1] The negatives [/h1]

There's no nice way to put this but the characters, side quests  and grinding are a direct downgrade from Tales of Berseria. It's almost like the writers looked at Berseria and decided to avoid everything that made it good.

-The grinding is downright annoying. 
Maybe Berseria spoiled me when in came to combat, but i never felt unprepared in Berseria when i only fought the required amount of enemies. If i killed every enemy in my way from point A to point B, then i would be more than enough prepared to fight the boss in point B. Arise takes this idea and completely throws it out the window. You are almost required to grind for levels if you wish to stand a chance in boss battles. While i really like the combat, i really wish i didn't have to fight so many enemies just so i could keep a matching level with the enemies

-The side quests are an absolute joke. 
You can barely justify their existence. Berseria had very few side quests and all pop up at the end of the game, but the story pay offs are immense. Every side quest is directly tied to each main character and it's a completion of each of their character arcs. I would almost say that these should be main story elements not just side quests, given their significance to each characters' journey. Arise takes this idea and throws , again, out the window. Aside from the gourmet side quests , there is not a single memorable side quest and all of them boil down to ""gather x amount of items"" or ""kill x amount of enemies"" with no story relevance. You're just doing the quests to get SP and EXP and nothing more.

-This might be a nitpick but the story moves REALLY fast. 
If you move at a decent pace you can defeat the first major enemy leader in 2-3 hours. For an empire that has subjugated your people for 300 years, it feels ridiculously easy to get to the point where you're kicking their ass. It feels like the strength of the enemy leaders really doesn't explain how they were able enslave everyone for so long.

-The maps feel claustrophobic. 
I thought Berseria had small maps, but these are even smaller. Most areas are just corridors. For places that are supposed to be sprawling cities they feel incredibly small.

-The characters are done dirty. 
Aside from Shionne, Law and Zephir, there is not a single well written character in the game.
In Berseria every character has a very good reason to be in the main party and be devoted to their goals . Not only that, but the game makes us care about every characters' journey. Arise completely fails to reproduce any feeling close to that by giving us half baked characters with even less baked motivations. 
Let's take the main characters from Berseria and Arise as comparisons. Velvet is shown to be a regular country side girl with modest aspirations. She mostly cares about her family and friends. In the prologue we experience the pain that changes Velvet from a bright eyed girl to a monster with a thirst for revenge, by that i mean [spoiler]  we see her brother in law kill her little brother, while we are forced to slaughter her entire village just so she can ultimately be turned into a monster and imprisoned [/spoiler] . By comparison Alphen is a shadow of a character with an almost non existent motivation. We know Alphen is a slave and that being a slave is bad, so we should stop the people that are enslaving others. That's Alphens' entire motivation and the player is never made to care about it. We know that slavery is bad, but why should the player care? Alphen never loses anyone close to him because of slavery, nor is there any character that we care about shown to die before Alphen starts revolting. Alphen is shown to care a great deal about about the suffering of the slaves, but to me it all feels fake. As a character Alphen has no real motivation that we can relate to. I can't identify with the need for justice in an unjust world when i haven't suffered from said injustices, but in the case of Velvet, as a player, i'm directly exposed to the injustices of the world and i'm immediately made to suffer because of them so when Velvet starts her revenge, i can understand on a more personal level why she goes so far for revenge.
The same can be said for every other character in Arise. Rimwell, Dohalim and Kiara join the main party because why not? None of them have any personal reason to be there other than ""slavery is bad, let's stop it!"". Adding insult to injury, Rimwell's character consistency is all over the place . She joins the main party for no real reason and is never shown to have hidden intentions to follow us, she is also always portrayed as being well mannered and caring but when [spoiler] she meets the first female enemy leader she loses her mind and becomes a blood thirsty maniac that is capable of killing her own friends [/spoiler] . This personality change comes from nowhere and it feels like it was quickly added to spice up the story but it only feels like it's shoe-horned in and doesn't fit with her character. It's also unclear how she views Renans. in some cut scenes she is shown to be very friendly to Shionne and Dohalim and sometimes not even one cut scene later she becomes racist(or xenophobic) towards them for almost no reason. It doesn't make sense. Does she hate them, or not?

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
In conclusion Tales of Arise improves mostly on the technical aspects of previous titles, by making the combat more captivating, more fast paced and more complex, while also improving on the over-all visuals of the game. Unfortunately that is the only thing that Tales of Arise manages to improve over titles like Tales of Berseria. The side quests, the characters, the story, the pacing and the grinding are all a direct downgrade. 
In all honesty, i admit i really love when a game focuses on characters and character stories, and the main reason i am so harsh with Arise is because Berseria was everything i wanted in a game and it proved to me that the creators are capable of making characters i really care about, so when Arise didn't live up to that i got really pissed.

Out of the three of them, Tales of Arise gives me the best and most convincing in-game world. Every setpiece in the world as its purposes, everything connects into one funnel that culminates in a very satisfying conclusion. Nothing goes to waste in this game.

Unfortunately the amazing worldbuilding is accompanied with subpar pacing. The story feels hurried, and there's barely any time or reason to enjoy the amazing world that the designer has created. The last parts of the game is the worst offender. A lot of infodump happens at the end of the game, and I barely see parts of the latter half of the twin worlds.

This type of game could do with more side quests that has a sub-plot of its own. I only see about 5 sub-plots in the sidequests that are barely worth mentioning. Some characters do get growth from these sidequests, but some others feels the same as when they joined the party, but to be fair, those characters are already whole from the start.

Combat mechanics are much more improved from the last two games. It's fun and responsive. Each characters in the party has their own unique sub-mechanics, and they play a significant role in combat. I just wish that those roles are more commanding rather than optional. You can finish the game without ever changing from the main character, but you'd miss out on a lot of combat fun.

Plot (7-8/10): 

The plot starts off very great until mid-late game, where the story does not make a great twist/develops into a climax.  The protagonists will be most of the screen time. There is not enough portray or build-up of the mid-late game antagonists. So the story in the later part is less absorbing because the late-game antagonists relatively lack substance. But overall the plot is not bad. Not big derailment. Cliche JRPG. What really makes it stand out (Or keep it well above average) is the substantial skit and amazing voiceover (personally prefer japanese, since the animation matches japanese but not english). It really makes the characters alive.  

Graphics (10/10): Absolutely love it. Marvellous. Amazing 3D models. Beautiful characters. Wounderful environment (You can screenshot any part of the game and set it as wallpaper). This is a milestone for tales series. 

Game mechanics (9/10): Definitely can see how much effort the developers have put into the game mechanics. There are multiple layers in the combat system, one on top of each other (Basic attack, spells different for each character, boost attack, boost strike, and elements). Great combos can be done if you think and try carefully. Boss is not very hard long as you can figure out their pattern and weak point, find out the attack timing. The other amazing part is dodging attack. Amazing rhythm and visual effect. 
One thing I don't like is the balance of the spells. Some characters' spells are way stronger than the remaining ones. It seems that you have no choice but to spam the spells.

Overall, TOAr is a milestone for Tales Series. Amazing artwork. Excellent voiceover. Great combat system. It is very likely you will be absorbed into the game in the first 60-70% of the game. In the later part where the secrets of the world are unfolded, the story soon becomes a bit bland. Moreover, the small mosters in the game are most, if not all, recycled. The later part of the game feels a bit repetitive.

The story follows the same storytelling formula of the previous games in the ""Tales of"" series, so long time fans will have a sense of familiarity. The story itself is great and newcomers would greatly enjoy it.

The combat in this game is an evolution of the action oriented combat system the series is known for. The addition of dodge mechanics and boost attacks in the combat enhances the enjoyability of the game. Combat is challenging at times, but never complex, it is very welcoming to newcomers. There are some difficulty spikes, but overall it is not a bad thing since the difficulty can be changed anytime in-game.

The graphics, overall, is a big upgrade over the previous games in the series, too bad it does not have photo mode, and it also lacks ultra-wide support; but dang the world is beautiful.

- great story, both long time fans and newcomers will love it

It's visually interesting and attractive, and the gameplay is good.

I do not approve of the balance, however, you do not deal enough damage to enemies for my taste. 
The received damage is fine though, a bit high maybe but I'm ok with a bit of challenge. 

And I certainly do not approve of the game giving you quests that are designed for parties twice your level and the soft-caping of said lvl (the amount of exp given by ennemies is partly determined by the level gap between you and them, making it very hard to farm) - that coupled with ""oh hey, you want levels ? It's ok, you can just buy them with real money at our shop !"".

Personally I play for the plot and characters development, you can expect the storyline to be similar to a hero trying to save the world (and solve everyone problem) together with his companion (with a lots of interesting plot twists) and of course I'm rooting for Main Female Character the entire time.

Plot wise: If you enjoy hours and hours of narrative (in a good way) that tell main story and characters development plus some cheesy romance development, this is the perfect game for you.

Combat: combat difficulty and exp grinding won't hinder story progress too much, by finishing most of the sub quests and minor grinding, I reach around lv60 before final boss which is at similar level. 
In term of combat mechanism, there are a 6 characters that you can play with and their skills can be configured. Combat can be a little underwhelming as you have other 3 NPC helping you to deal damage, or if you are underleveled, prepare to get wiped out in an instance or burn through your expensive potions.

Usually with games these days I make it maybe 3 cutscenes into the story before seeing that it's more junk and starting to skip past. ToA captivated me from the beginning. Opening up as the story of enslaved people desperately hoping to escape their captors, Tales of Arise becomes a story showing the many different forms of human subjugation throughout history: pure, unadulterated slavery (USA); secret police and labor camp oppression (USSR, China, among others); oppressive working conditions and human capital disposal (South America, Dubai); thought control (North Korea); and colonizer-installed minority governments (USA/Europe -> all over Africa). While things do swing into anime territory towards the back end, I found there to be great nuance in the opening acts, especially in dialog from the main characters. Interesting twists and surprises present themselves throughout the story.

Gameplay was a blast, offering a fairly classic Tales formula with new twists here and there. Initially, the lack of Artes slots felt bad, especially when you were acquiring new artes at a rapid pace, but once the slots double, things feel better. (On the other hand, through the back half of the game, you'll barely get any new artes at all.) Balance, however, is a catastrophe. You'll go from plowing through standard mobs on Very Hard difficulty only to get the boss of an area and get absolutely steamrolled and have to lower the difficulty sometimes all the way down to Story to have a chance. Other times the dungeon and standard mobs will drain you of all of your resources by the time you reach the boss, only for the boss to be a total pushover, easier than a regular fight with the dungeon's enemies. Experience and SP (skill tree points) are also awarded  very unevenly, where you'll get more SP from a single fetch quest than you do two hours grinding out in the field. Throughout the entire last dungeon, with numerous XP boosts equipped, I didn't get a single level up, but the very first fight in a pathetically easy post-game dungeon netted me 3 full levels! Oversights like this are endless: a quest that wants you to acquire an ultimate weapon requires resources only found in post-game dungeons, but rewards you with armor worse than you acquired in standard dungeons hours earlier. There are also some disappointing ""boss fights"" where the gigantic, awesome boss appears in the distance, only to summon standard mobs for you to fight while he lazers you from above. It felt like they ran out of time, but then why have there been no meaningful post-launch patches? A lot of this can have (and should have) been ironed out.

Graphically, this game is top notch, surpassing all expectations and rendering the world in stunning detail. An innocuous, almost unused temple area in a later game city presents possibly the most beautiful room I've ever seen in a video game. The graphics and art design never miss.

Overall, a solid 9/10. It's hard for major games to pull me in these days, but this one held me from the beginning. Highly recommended.",1645647043,1645647043,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After 15 hours of gameplay, it’s clear to me that this game will not be getting any better. Some of my favorite JRPGs have been Tales of Xillia and Tales of Berseria, but this game is what I consider to be the worst in the mothership franchise.   
 
Story (2/10): The story follows the standard JRPG formula: You get a male character with a case of memory loss, you meet a girl that changes your life, and you go on an adventure to save the world. It introduces the themes of oppression, revolution and racism giving it a dark and serious tone. I believe this story has a lot of potential to be great, which is a shame because the story is terrible. 

The story is meant to be serious, so when you easily liberate 300 years of slavery in the first four hours and three people, it feels fake and hollow. There are pacing issues and plot holes everywhere. How you manage to bring forth revolution seems like a child’s version of how to save the world. Characters are one-dimensional and feel like they have no depth to them, while villains are just evil with no motivation or backstory whatsoever.  
 
Gameplay (6/10): The gameplay is decent but repetitive. If you have played any of the major Tales games, you’ve played this battle system. Little strategy is used beside dodge the enemy and unleash your special attacks. Stringing combos feels good and unleashing boost combos are also great, but unfortunately you can’t do this in boss fights. Bosses are nothing but attack sponges and will sometimes instant kill you in one hit, forcing you to revive. Exploration on the other hand is boring, and side-quests are often just fetch-quests for skill points without any impact onto the story. 
 
Presentation (5/10): The graphics on characters look OK and the textures are passable, but the world and levels look terrible. Field textures are grainy and the color design is washed-out with gray. The Tales games have always had poor level design, but with the new high resolution, it really stands out as ugly. The music is actually pretty good, it does the job of setting the right tone when exploring a realm or heading to battle, but memorable tracks are few and far between.
 
Impressions (5/10): Overall, this game is very mediocre. The story, characters and setting of a JRPG is vital in a game where the primary gameplay is already reused from previous titles. In the end, I unlocked the main cast and realized I didn’t care about what happens next. I can see why people may enjoy the gameplay, but everything else seem so sub-par. I cannot recommend this game to a Tales fan, and I would not recommend this game to the average gamer.

The world itself has a beautiful atmosphere with lots of color to set yourself into the settings that you take place in. The upgrade graphics, art style, and visuals are pleasing to look at while traveling through. The added animated cut scenes by Ufotable and the music alongside it create big and memorable moments to look back on. The soundtrack gave the game even more life as we entered through important scenes and entered new territories. 

While I'm not the most well-versed in the Tales of series only playing games such as Symphonia, Abyss, Vesperia, Berseria, and Zestiria, the game has left a good impression character wise. To me, Tales of was always the game that had very strong characters and a weaker story which is completely fine. The character growth was well paced with each chapter and the way each character lightens up to each other is wonderful. They meshed well together with their personalities and created very silly moments within the group. While most of these are very lighthearted, if there was a dialogue that did not have a major point or was completely unrelated I found myself skipping through them. I felt the shorter and one-liner dialogue from the previous titles felt more impactful and left a better impression overall. Some of these are similar to Berseria dialogue where the extra dialogue would take forever to get to the point. While many people liked this, starting off with the older titles made me appreciate the shorter interactions rather than a longer script. 

The game itself wasn't linear as the previous title Berseria and provided plenty of sidequests and extra areas to explore. There are plenty of activities to do in the game with Fishing, Artifacts, quests, exploring, and extra fights to provide more content. The one thing I constantly had trouble with playing on the Medium difficulty was collecting money. I always felt that upgrading and getting items would be the thing on the side that I would constantly need to do. While the quests did give money, sometimes the rewards wouldn't be enough for what I had spent for say an optional boss fight. The prices of the items were pretty high and maintaining them would be the problem for me personally. Another problem was reusing of boss enemies as normal enemies. While this is fine to have, I felt as though some of the normal encounters were drawn out as well. Overall, there are plenty of things to do but there are some aspects that limited my progression.

The gameplay was very fluid and simple. Having good positioning and understanding the flow of battle is very easy to get into while starting the game. As someone who mostly played fast sword characters such as Repede from Vesperia, Lloyd from Symphonia, and Luke from Abyss, I found myself playing different styles. I mostly played Dohalim, Law, and Rinwell. While playing outside of my comfort zone I loved playing these new styles and you don't need to limit yourself to the main character. Try out all of the characters and you might find some enjoyment outside of your comfort zone. 

Overall, there's plenty of customization on your first playthrough. You can play and progress through the game however you want and it's always rewarding to do option content. There's plenty of activities to do in the game but there are some bumps in progression for me. Overall I would recommend this game to newcomers of the series because of it's accessibility and how easy it is to understand the game. It may not be for everyone because the Tales of series are notorious for being long, but the payoff is something amazing.",1645487783,1645487783,True,5,0,0.548926055431365967,0,True,False,False

I basically bought the game out of boredom, I had read a lot of mixed reviews but really wanted a single player game I could burn some free time on so I went for it. Actually ended up being one of the best games I have played in years. I played a ton of the early ""Tales"" games but there were so many gaps between consoles I never had that I missed a few. I can't say that I can compare this game to any other style of game I've played over the recent years. It's not a turn based combat like most early JRPGs but it fuses the ""free roam"" aspect of moving your character around while fighting, but sometimes pausing to use items or swap characters to use certain skills. Between the combat, UI, music, and overall story telling it actually reminded me heavily of the ""Star Ocean"" series which I love the death, haven't missed a title. The story is great, sounds, music, and voice acting was very fitting. Plenty of quests to keep you busy (in fact some are challenging enough that you have to beat the game first before attempting). My computer is about 7 years old from this post yet it still played it at a solid 60 fps, gorgeous game.

I saw some art for this game a long time ago and followed this game's ""updates"" all the way until release. Everything looked promising in the trailers, the world, characters, story, gameplay, etc..

 While I have never played any other Tales game in the series, even I can tell this game, just as a JRPG, is pretty shit. 

For starters, the greatest selling point of this game is the combat. I don't know about you, but to me almost every battle is the exact same thing. You run into an enemy on the map, you go into the battle circle, focus one enemy while your party does ""things"", press the same buttons in the same order around six times, wait until the enemy dies, and repeat. Granted, when you eventually get enough arts to mix and match, the dullness of battle isn't as bad. However, when you find arts you want to or have to stick with for a while everything becomes boring. You could just say I don't really care for ""hack and slash"" games, but I've played ""Nier Automata"" all the way through and it has a very similar ""hack and slash"" type of battle system, the major difference being arts don't exist in that game. And it's better for it. 

While I didn't reach the point in Tales of Arise where Kisara and I assume later, Dohalim join the party so I could test them out, all four party members I currently had felt completely monotonous or ""meh"" at best. Even if I ever eventually found a grove with one of the characters play styles it wouldn't make up for the huge mess of a story I had to witness. 

The first 2-4 hours of the game are ""fine"" at best and really, really ""anime"" at worst. Originally, Alphen and Shionne come off as a pair that had real, physical potential for a interesting relationship. The problem is, this game loves to say you need to read in between the lines, but every time I look for a deeper meaning, the words and characters fall short. Some skits almost scratch the surface of what real stories are like, but they never get close enough for me to say they were anything, but boring or meaningless. There's basically little to no chemistry between any of the main four I got to use before I decided to stop playing this game. 

The actual story of this game is insanely rushed to the point that one minute you arrive in a town, the next your destroying the government that's been in place for centuries. It feels like your being thrown to your next location every time you sit down to take a break. The antagonists of this game are basically nonexistent, with the first two lords you kill being unmemorable and not even given enough screen time to say a paragraph of dialogue. You meet them, then you murder them. Because this game doesn't have the time to explain almost anything. I am actually quite amazed that this is the story that comes along with a $60 price tag. 

In the end, I highly suggest you don't get this game. It's a waste of time, unless of course, you really just enjoy pretty lights and a ""beautiful world"".",1645296718,1645296718,False,2,0,0.473885864019393921,0,True,False,False

To put it bluntly, the story sucks. The gameplay is passable and it looks great for a Tales Of game. 
But holy shit the entire party is awful. The combat breaks down worse than Zestiria's at high levels. Every moral of the story is said to you in plain text over and over and over because they HAVE TO BE SURE you got it.

Combat truly shines in this game, it is satisfying even casually played with one character all the time. Side quests were interesting and rewarding and you feel like progress is nicely rewarded by spending time on developing your characters.  Now then, what really killed my binge sitting on this one? Characters are rather cringe to be honest, especially the main protagonists chemistry started to piss me off every now and then, even there is a story sided reasonable sense to it. Towards the end of the game, last dungeons were not fun to play anymore not only that monsters simply had so high HP pool that it just started to feel like a chore to kill them even with good gear and normal difficulty, BUT the most annoying was endless skits and cinematics in a row killing the momentum of progressing forward. I would not usually complain about story progression via cinematics but this was just overkill to me with the amount that is smacked against your face as the story was not so great and i had hard time to focus on it anymore towards the end.

The combat is a really well done combination of magic and melee combat. Both English and Japanese voice acting is well done.

That's where all the good things about the game ends. The characters that seem very interesting at the start become unbearable real quick. They are extremely one dimensional and regurgitate their same views every single cutscene.

The skits although very fun to view, even they are extremely boring. After about 20th skit about how Rennans are bad it just gets mind numbing. 

The game has no sense of subtle story telling. It feels the need to specify every single thing for the player. Throughout the whole game all characters keep repeating the same thing about plight of dahnans under the rennan rule again and again and again. I wonder if would've been better to show not tell this.

The overarching game design is so repetetive. Travel to new location -> Dungeon -> Boss. Repeat 5 times. It just starts to feel bloated and gets extremely boring after the 3rd location.

Some characters are extremely annoying. Rinwell is extremely annoying and sometimes I wish I could just punch her face in. She's just a bitch, she feels this urge to always end conversations with snarky comments.

Story too is quite tropey and predictable. Buy this only at a steep sale.

The hero is a kind warrior who is by no means a pushover (which often happens to nice guys). He comes off as pure and strong because he can fight, but he also cares. The main female can be standoffish at first, but turns out she has a really good reason for it, one you don't find out until halfway through the game. All the other characters are incredibly rounded and fun and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of their development.

Story: 10/10: Great storytelling. The diversity of character and setting open the game for detailed and interesting story. There is a point in the middle where it seems to end and then diverges into another path, and I will admit it almost seems like two different stories. But I still enjoyed it and was very glad to have a game that actually took time to answer questions. And playing the first bit again, I realized they set up for the second half. I just didn't notice it.

Combat: 8/10 You should all know, I do not give good ratings on combat lightly. Combat for this game shares a quality of turn-based combat in that it pulls you into a separate map, but you have full command of your character and a range of attacks that are not turn based. I still enjoyed most aspects of combat, though at times the quantity of combat grew tedious and I found myself avoiding fights (but that's just me).

World: 8/10 World is the big reason why the story seemed to diverge into two different branches. The first half of the game takes place on a very medieval planet with hints of a race with superior technology. Then the cast travels to another planet where all the technology exists, and it can feel a little out of place, even though you knew the other planet and technology existed the entire time. Even so, each location was unique and interesting, so I still rank the game high in world.

Late game, there's five cutscenes in every new area of brain-dead dialogue only to lead to another cutscene, which leads to more brain-dead dialogue discussing what they just discussed in the previous cutscene to lead to another cutscene, a group break so you can discuss what they just discussed on an individual level, and then getting back together to discuss the same thing and then repeating what just happened in the next area. This formula is repeated over and over and I've never seen it this bad in any Tales of game.

- While this might be considered speculative from my side, late game balancing is fucked due to the push of EXP/Money boosters dlc content.

Conclusion: It is an ""okay"" rpg, but frankly the writing and story, something that might have been great back in the 90's PlayStation era of JRPGs, ultimately fails to deliver an engaging narrative by modern standards.

The story to me was bland and predictable. The pacing is really weird and the mood of each skit (press R1) bounces a lot. They give you 2-3 skits back to back and it makes the story telling awkward at times especially the character development. There is a lot of dialogue bloat where they like to beat you with the same idea over and over and over again in quick succession.

The gameplay is decent. It starts off slow, and gets better around the middle but eventually over stays it's welcome. Sure the combat feels more fluid but it's kind of a small upgrade in the general scope of things. The AI is still extremely dumb, the strategy system is too simple and it doesn't seem to work properly at times. For example if you have it set to like ""if own hp is 50%, avoid enemy"". Law seems to understand and completely stays away from the monsters, never attacking, and just dodges. Alphen on the other hand will keep on attacking until he dies. The ordering of the strategy doesn't seem to matter much either.

The bosses you face generally feel like your hitting a giant sack of potatoes. The first one was probably the more interesting one. The 2nd boss was just straight up bs with the one move that can instakill your whole party. The rest are just generic potatoes, but there's one boss that's small and is frustrating to land certain artes on. For whatever reason the game decides it wants to point the cone or certain slashing artes next to the boss completely hitting air.

The regions/dungeons look nice but they are mainly linear with generic corridors. Crafting and general gear upgrades are very straight forward. I just picked the weapon/armor with the better stats and didn't bother with the accessory. By the time I unlocked the better accessories I just stopped caring.

As you progress through the game the monsters are reused and gain a lot of hp. On top of that they added monsters that have boss like hp. I played the game on normal difficulty thinking I wouldn't have to deal with hp sponges but the later half of the game just becomes brain dead hp sponges. The last dungeon they specifically placed mobs with boss like hp to block paths so you are forced to fight. It seems like they are padding up the gameplay time. Eventually you'll come to the realization that it comes down to whether or not you have enough items to get you through the dungeon.

Kind of hard to recommend this game due to the story and the gameplay just couldn't carry it for me. If your a Tales fan your most likely going to buy it anyway. If your new and don't really watch anime or play a lot of jrpgs, the story might not be so predictable for you. It's not really one of those must play games that break new ground so I would wait for a discount if you want to try it.",1644306901,1644306901,False,8,0,0.547512352466583252,1,True,False,False

Combat is excellent and very enjoyable. If you like a game with a good story and an excellent combat system, this is for you. Looking forward to more of the story.

Edit: a few more hours in and the story gets better. Very much enjoying this game. Easily 1 of my favorites ... like ever

Edit2: I have now finished the game and without a doubt this is one of my favorite games ever. Amazing story, the combat is so much fun. Highly recommended. 10/10 for me.",1641970334,1644304775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So this is purely from a newbie perspective of the game and how it was for me.

Tales of Arise is one of the most colorful and beautifully crafted worlds i've ever had the pleasure of experiencing! Each region you end up visiting during your adventures are really great to look at and explore!
Although, the experience does get slightly hampered due to the fact that each region is separated as a sandbox and although you technically can walk through exploring region to region you dont ""organically"" walk into the different regions like you would an open world game, you go through a load screen and voila you're there! 

The wonder and amazement of the environments around you slowly evolve from desert to forest or icy plains as you travel from region to region is not present here which does slightly affect the experience adversely.

The story is pretty straightforward and quite predictable, which does not necessarily mean a bad thing as the characters and writing hold it up quite well! Some of the other themes and issues that the game tackles such as prejudice and racism are all done very well in this game!

The voice acting is really good! It gave so much dimensions to the characters and the extra development you get for the characters through the skits are an absolute delight to watch! some are admittedly pretty meh, but most are very interesting and help flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other very well.

The gameplay is super fun, and you can rotate between who you want to play as during fights! Each character has a TON of skills to play around with, and certain characters have their individual mechanics. There is a ton of stuff to master in this game! 

However i did just stuck with the few that really felt like great combos so I never explored much beyond trying to rank up each move which may unlock a new move through that as well! 

There are so many QoL features in this game and it really shows that the devs just want you to have fun with the game. Quick travel points are a plenty and most of them are near quest givers or quest areas so you rarely spend too much time looking for objective areas and monsters as well as completing them. 

Not only that, the map is also easy to navigate and an objective marker is shown as a big ass star in green on the map so you really cant miss it! 

Overall I enjoyed the experience and I am definitely going in once more for NG+ its an easy recommend for me for fans who enjoy JRPGs and are looking for a game to have fun with! The best time to get it for me would be if its on sale at 50%! an easy 8/10 for me!",1644246855,1644246855,True,27,0,0.743107974529266357,0,True,False,False

This game is one of the best games I have played in a while, which is considering I just beat Persona 5 Royal and am currently playing Persona 4 Golden. This game is self contained in its own bubble so that you don't have to play the other games to play this one. I am currently writing this review directly after beating the game.

Combat
Combat is by far the best thing about this game. This combat system is similar to other Tales games in a sense that you have a small arena to fight in and a Arte system that has been polished more than previous titles. The combat system is amazing, never in a game have I had this much fun chaining combos together with teammates, performing special moves, and just feeling like a kid again. This games combat system did that to me, having me always say something great about the combat system. Alphen having a mechanic where he sacrifices HP for more damage, a very nice high risk high reward system. And each character has their own unique mechanic, not on the level of Alphens(I played him the most and liked his combat style the most), still served its purpose and was fun using.

Story(No Spoilers)
Story wasn't my main focus until later in the first half of the game with the diverse and hefty plot twists and plot reveals. But after going to Ganath Haros is where to me narratively the game picks up with the mysteries of Alphen's past is revealed. 
The story revolves around Alphen, a Danhan slave who wears an iron mask, not able to feel pain and has no memories of his past. His Renan rulers abuse Alphen's fellow Danhan slaves to the point where he tries to fight for his freedom. His fight leads him to meet Shionne, a runaway Renan who's goal is to defeat the 5 Renan rulers that rule Danha. Having accepted Shionnes help, they meet many Resilience groups who have their own story of pain involving the Renans.
The first half of the game(Danha) is the intro to the characters, their ambitions, and their personalities. The racism that has plagued the two races(Danhans and Renans) is shown in the main cast as they fight amongst themselves throughout the game, growing closer together and moving past the racism. The story was very satisfying for me as I enjoyed the vast character development that happened throughout the various skits, character interactions, and banter that happened throughout the story. All the characters had their own personal goals that made them stand out, making it so that no one had no purpose. Every character felt alive and real as they struggled to push to the final goal of the story, as no one felt robotic or artificial.

Soundtrack
The soundtrack was breathtaking as the music and sound affects added to the games atmosphere. Every important moment was complimented by a great soundtrack, making each moment feel more impactful. Each area and region that added its own set of soundtracks that made each area feel alive in different ways. And I really don't think anything I can say can express how good of a job Bandai Namico did. Props to them on this part 

World
The world was vast and each area was a breathtaking experience. Going from such polarizing areas like a volcano to a snowy castle to a grassy green domain made the game feel alive, making each area feel different. The exploration of these areas was great as there was always more places to explore pre ending and post ending. I always had more to explore and more to gain whether it be a optional boss, a new area, new items or enemies. Each area had a live of its own as each one had its own story and history. And each area had its own cast of characters that served their purpose without feeling out of place. And each area had a abundant of side quests to give more life to its citizens. Side quests were very simple and were abundant in each area. Side quests involved easy tasks such as gathering ingredients, killing enemies, or defeating bosses.
And as such these side quests added to the vast character interacts which added to the great character development.

Cons
The villians weren't the best in terms of writing, but this doesn't really take away from the great experience i had playing this

Conclusion
This game was beyond what i expected and now i feel empty as to what i will play next, because i dont know if a game will make me feel like this for a long time. Take that as you will and try this game out as you develop your own opinion.

I've played most of the modern games since Symphonia, and after going through the first half of Arise I can confidently say that it ranks among my favorite entries in the series. It's a very strong showing after the previous generation of Tales games failed to impress. 

Combat:
At the core of a jRPG is its combat. Arise has learned from the mistakes of some of its previous games and built a really fantastic combat system. Gone are the days of confusing arte action trees and obscure arte typing - the mechanics are straightforward and the feel of the combat is fantastic. Arise has a great combo system that is intuitive but takes effort to master. Everything feels very snappy and responsive, and the super move system feels easy to use and impactful. I have some minor nits, but they do not detract overall from the experience. First, I wish you could dodge-cancel out of arte animations. Some artes go on for quite some time, and it's unfortunate that you can't abort your attack to dodge an attack. This is especially necesary in battles with lots of hard-hitting enemies. Second, invincibility frames could use some tweaking, especially for the player character. Many powerful enemies have nasty multi-attacks that can easily one-hit KO even sturdy characters because they can stun lock you for several seconds while hitting you multiple times. Damage values would be totally reasonable if only the first attack dealt damage, but the follow ups are too punishing. Bosses are especially bad for this. Item balance is very different from previous entries in the game, with restoration items costing an arm and a leg. I overall love the change to using a shared mana pool for just healing artes - it is a very nice middle ground that gives you in battle healing that is reasonably limited while allowing you to use attack artes to your heart's content. 

The story is solid overall. The first thing that I noticed was how quickly it moved to the inciting incident and full-bore into the main story. This is a welcome departure from some previous entries in the series that wrapped you up in hours of intro before you reached the meat of the game. The games theme centers around liberation - a salient topic in today's world, and one that it treats with remarkable nuance and care. Tales games have often distinguished themselves with their excellent writing, and Arise is a return to form. The game's writers also seem to enjoy hiding subtle references to other jRPG titles, including some clever subversions.

The characters are above-average. Arise's writers have wisely aged the cast up from previous installments, with the characters mostly being young adults rather than teenagers, with a bit of extra sense and experience to match. There are also mercifully no annoying or joke characters. There are some excellent character moments and development, though nothing so far to rival the hardest hitting in Symphonia and Xillia. There are a few nits I have in this area as well. First, the two main characters have a tendency to bicker, especially near the beginning of the story. This thankfully tapers off, but it can get somewhat annoying. Luckily, you can skip forward through dialog, so you need not waste your time listening to yet another spat between Shionne and Iron Mask. Second, the skits have a somewhat unfortunate tendency to explain the game's subtext. This may just be a stylistic nit, but it feels unnatural for characters to just lay their feelings and motivations out so clearly in conversation - I'd prefer for some of it to remain subtext.

The graphics are just unbelievably pretty. The character models look excellent, and the animations are smooth and natural. The environment art is some of the best that I've seen in a video game - the studio has clearly overcome it issues developing HD games and delivered an amazing visual experience. The areas are hand-crafted - gone are the days of same-y field and dungeon areas with endlessly reused assets. The maps were designed around macro elements that help you understand where you are in the bigger picture. This makes the occasional asset re-use forgivable, though it does become noticeable here and there.

I set it up on Moderate as I started the game, but I found myself struggling with even simple enemies. I unfortunately had to set it back to normal, but as I got the chance to level up faster, I returned to Moderate, and I found it to be a more challenging but not so troublesome.

About the story, it has been an absolute blast. When I thought something couldn't flip for an even crazier twist, well, I was surprised.
The main characters are absolutely incredible, each one has their own flaws, but also something that makes them really unique. I can say the same about the Lords, absolutely fantastic development.
The ambience is beautiful, each realm has an unique touch to it. 

Overall really good.",1631249917,1644104018,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

problems just kept mounting until i couldnt enjoy the game anymore. the cliches of the story slowly get more and more cringeworthy and each new party member feels less and less useful or interesting, plus it becomes really obvious how underdeveloped the combat system is and how terrible the AI is.

the custom strategy feature is almost completely useless, and you cant even give different strategies to individual party members which is just insane. AI party members straight up just dont care about their own safety sometimes, and enemies dont seem to choose a target based on any kind of advanced logic; usually meaning they just repeatedly try to attack the player and can very easily be tricked into spamming certain moves over and over again, to their own detriment, just by you standing at certain distances.

If I were to pin-point what I considered to be Tale of Arise's best aspect, it would be... If you are someone (like myself) who always got a bit of a tingle of satisfaction watching party members talk amongst themselves in jRPGs, and got especially satisfied when party member #8 you got most of the way through the game actually converses with every other party member, this game is going to be a very satisfying experience. The characters talk a lot, they converse constantly, and the dialogue changes as the game goes on, both in and out of combat. Regardless of how you feel about the characters, you do feel the relationships and dynamics forming between each and every party member.

That I feel is the game's strongest aspect, which is not to understate the others, which are...

[b]Story (5~8/10):[/b]

That's right, it's a sliding ranking. If you are interested in the main protagonists, character evolutions and themes, Tales of Arise's story is pretty good. The main troupe are all nice characters in their own right and have their own problems to overcome and the theme of the game seems to be pretty consistent throughout. There is a load of interactions you will witness with your party, from talking in/out/around combat, camping, resting, cooking, wandering about. The ""skits"" as they call them are everywhere.

If however, you're looking for a wonderfully executed story which treds on new ground and executes it's beats wonderfully, you might find Tales of Arise to be either satisfactory or mildly disappointing. There are many moments in the story that I felt were not executed in the best of fashion, and a few which felt like last minute decisions. In many ways Arise's story is very typical jRPG, and old school jRPG at that, even adhering to old-school philosophy of stuff going off the rails and going over the top at the end.

The best way I can describe Arise's story is one which succeeds for it's protagonists and fails for it's antagonists. I will not elaborate further for fear of spoilers, but... I definitely will not be remembering the villains of this game.

[b]Sound (8/10):[/b]

The audio of the game is all pretty good, with some really nice sound effects in combat and pretty (but not hugely standout) music here and there. 

The Japanese Dub is pretty good, while my experience with the English is limited, it did not seem to be particularly great at first glance. Which is a shame, I much prefer English for video games. Really hard to fight battles and read subtitles at the same time.

I did notice that the game's music would sometimes be a bit too loud for the dialogue that was going on, and it was difficult to hear. One cutscene specifically had some weird audio quality on it as well. Not a huge or common problem, just something that popped up every now and again.

[b]Gameplay [Out of combat] (8/10):[/b]

The game's menu navigation, character progression, world navigation and such are all very nicely done. The skill system is nice, as you can upgrade your character and get new skills as per your choice (relatively), and while by the end of the game you will have everything, that freedom early on is really nice. It's also nice that using skills powers them up and unlocks new skills in the same line, so you can fortify a playstyle early on.

The accessory system also adds more customization, but I will be honest, it's a bit MMO grindy and random. I sort of wish it was easier to get the build items you wanted more consistently. It also doesn't really open up until end-game. So this feature is something more designed for end-game or new game plus, it seems like.

While this is very specific, something I thought almost immediately upon moving in this game is... the run speed is perfect. It feels like a human running, it's not too fast or too slow, it's exactly the speed I would want. Which makes navigating about very quick and easy. Even more so, as you have quick travel from the get-go, something you can freely use because the game tells you exactly where all main/sub quests are. So you don't need to go running through every area.

[b]Gameplay [Combat] (9/10):[/b]

While early on the gameplay might feel a bit slow, and perhaps even clunky, once you get a few hours into the game and unlock some skills and get more AG (actions), the combat really speeds up and starts to feel really nice. Whether you want to combo people to death or just spam the same skill over and over, the choice is yours. On-top of the fact you can play as any character, which you can freely switch to at any point in battle means you can effectively get many different playstyles. I mostly used the main character, but there is an entirely new game with each character and that's just great. Really opens up replayability.

Enemies are simple in their attack patterns, but threatening enough to not be mundane to deal with. You can absolutely be a god at the game and never get hit, or you can go down over and over again. I, for one, enjoy any game where you can beat any enemy at level 1 -- I would say, except the linear scaling in stats is large, so fighting an enemy 20+ levels above you is going to take a long time. Something I wish was less the case.

I will not spoil every mechanic, nor explain how they inter-relate, but overall, the mechanics in the game all work really nicely together. There is however one weak part of the game's combat...

[b]Party AI:[/b] 

The AI starts off fine, but as the game progresses, boy... they do get stupid. Now, part of me felt it was sort of necessary for the AI to not be amazing, otherwise the game would be a cake-walk, but at times, it did feel like I was fighting against my allies more than enemies.

The game does include a ""strategy"" option you can manipulate, but it's only very broad and loose terms, like... ""If HP < 50%... stay away from enemies"" and such. It can work, and it's actually pretty important you do do some tweaking later on in the game, but it's still very iffy. I really wish you could be more specific and create strategies for EACH character instead of having one broad strategy. Worse, is while you can pick strategies and have 4 of them, changing them mid-battle doesn't seem to work. So the strategy you pick at the start is the one they're going to use.

Now, utilizing the mechanics, switching party members, using boost attacks to make your party invincible when you see them about to get hit and such are all things you can do to sort of mitigate the issues, but... without question this game is missing options here. Even being able to tell your party to focus on an enemy or something. You get nothing. The best thing you have is the ability to turn off skills for your party members, so they don't use them.

On one hand, I want more, on another, I feel the game might be too simple if the AI was too good, so... *Shrugs*

[b]Difficulty [It Exists!]:[/b] 

I cannot express in words how happy I was that this game's difficulty settings actually succeed. I played the game on Hard, I personally felt like it was perfectly scaled. Difficult without being overwhelming. I am confident if you're someone who wants an easier time, normal will be quite enough, and if you're far better than I am, there's a difficulty above hard for you, sir.

[b]Graphics [8/10]:[/b]

I personally find this game to be very pretty, it has this sort of paint-brush aesthetic to the characters which I think looks really nice and is a welcome adjustment from just another pure anime-look. The environments are all nice looking and enjoyable to wander through, and at certain times, quite a feast for the eyes.

The visual effects in combat are particularly stunning, with some really nice particle work on the skills. Really provides nice oomph, without clustering the screen too much. You know... until Rinwell goes all Goku and beam struggles in the middle of the screen.

This game is fun and DEFINITELY difficult however rewarding.  I keep the difficulty on Moderate, I attempted hard and I was not a fan of the spongy enemies, even though they still appear that way on Moderate, but its more enjoyable but still frustrating at times.

At first its definitely a learning curve.  As with all JRPG prepare to farm a lot, have patience and take breaks when necessary.  It's makes the game much more enjoyable when you're not tiled to oblivion. Story is kind of whatever, I don't pay attention too much as it's kinda bland and boring TO ME, but do not let that deter you from enjoying the story :) .

I only have a couple grips, the AI is just awful 0/10 and the bosses are sometimes WAY to spongy.  They fail to dodge/reposition, burn through CP unless you configure a strategy setup where they're only healing/using CP when important.

========================================

Pros:
-Like the more recent(?) tales games, there's no TP.
-Actual aerial combat (imo).
-Transitions from field to battle is relatively seamless.
-Obligatory fashion
-Fishing
-Simple weapon forging system; nothing like the crazy stuff from zestiria/berseria for really broken gear.
-""Skill trees"" that are attached to titles; not forced to have to go through x node to reach y node
-Accessory crafting allows for some degree of customizing your accessories exactly how you want
-Level difference is a thing with how this game works; the old adage of ""bigger numbers = win"" applies here.
-Emphasis on dodging; a different play style from the rest of the series.
-No TP, but a general pool of CP (cure points), for healing artes.
-Game is very easy to 100%/platinum

Cons:
-Emphasis on dodging; insofar that there's no way to block, at all. Dodging is your block.
-Dodge game play isn't rewarding.
-The one character who can block, can't dodge. Feels awkward.
-Items cost an arm and a leg for reasons unknown. Remember those orange gels costing 800? 1200? in the old games? ----They cost 3k here; CP doesn't restore outside of a few food effects and resting at an inn.
-If you're aiming for a ND run, better get ready to solo the game. AI companions are very prone to dying due to lack of strategy custom options we've seen in prior games.
-Stagger is a suggestion for enemies; don't waste time building penetration, especially on the harder difficulties
-Story is meh.
-Without DLC, your spell casters are locked to their respective (story/lore) elemental artes. (barring a few sidequests).
-SAO DLC is super not worth. 
-Burn through CP very quick (unless you're some kind of top tier pro who always insist these games are too easy)
-Game is very easy to 100%/platinum
-No real incentive to pursue NG+

If you like the tales series, no matter what, go for it. I didn't go in with very high expectations, having known very little about the game prior to purchase, and I wasn't horribly disappointed as a result. Overall, it was, maybe, 50 hours to finish the game (a lot of my playtime is from leaving it on and idling), and maybe another 10-20 to wrap up the postgame stuff and 100%. Decent enough time sink, but, I'd only recommend this on a better sale than the one that's currently going on.",1643874540,1643874540,False,2,0,0.452767103910446167,0,True,False,False

The performance is solid and there's some pretty good art direction here. Sometimes it doesn't quite come together and feels very Unreal Engine, but it mostly does a great job mimicking the anime art styles that inspired it. 

The story and characters are...fine, relying a bit too much on tropes and cliche. But I can't deny that the writing is genuinely funny at time. The music is generally great; I just wish there was a little more of it (apparently Bandai considers music an ""optional"" DLC). The best part so far has been the combat which does a lot to innovate from previous titles. However, I'm more than a little disappointed that co-op has been stripped from the game.

Best battle ""feeling"" in Tales series. The characters game play is somewhat varied, even though it can be shallow in artes progression compared to previous games. Enemies have little to no secret in beating, learn attack patterns and elemental weakness (which is very simple btw). Enemies visual, sound, animation, AI are shared between similar types. Almost every enemy or boss can be beat by basically hit+run (repeat) with 1 character alive. Some late-game bosses have a hit kill attack so in those cases you need someone else so you don't have a party KO. No victory scene, so you save some seconds per fight. But I must emphasize that the combat game play feels very good!

[Audio]
I have mixed feelings regarding the soundtrack. Sometimes it sounds very good, like really very good, but then the moment you leave an area or close the game, you hardly remember any piece of music. Voice acting is quite decent. I really like how the characters call out their shots or shout their spells in battle. The only truly negative highlight is one of the bosses who has the most forced laughter in history of voice acting, I'm serious, it's comically tragic. In terms of dialogue, their dialogues in common areas and at the end of each battle are very repetitive. Law's random dialogues by the end of the game are VERY disturbing/annoying. I'd rather have *him* silent all the time, but unfortunately we don't have that option. In terms of sound effects, nothing to complain, so apparently they did a good job.

[Graphics}
The game is an upgrade on its predecessors. Finally something other than the very basic shading and childish/cartoony art style. Sometimes there is just too much shining and blinking visual effects in battle scenes, to the point where you have no idea whats going on, and eventually you just get used to timing and enemy patterns and pretty much don't care about whats going on, you just know what to do. 

[Story]
It is very straight and easy to follow. There is nothing that requires further investigation and every piece of information is basically given on a silver platter. That is a bummer. Learning about Melnics in Tales of Eternia and reading through the books in that exquisite ""language"" was super fun, but there is nothing deep to investigate. Very basic plot, no plot twists, just the story unfolding. I expected more. One thing that really bothered me is that at some point in the story, they just changed the intro animation to something else, which SPOILS the rest of the game. And they actually played that during the game play, so if you don't know whats coming up, there's no way to know that it will spoil future events.That was a TERRIBLE decision. TERRIBLE. The skits are okay-ish, but honestly, didn't miss them.

[Design]
The design of the game is simplistic, and it feels like the studio went for the safe beaten path of everything that proved to work in previous iterations. Accept quest, deliver item. Accept quest, hunt enemy, report back. I think that's it. Dungeons are very linear and there is little exploration to do. In places where you can """"""explore"""""", there is usually just ore or some basic item, nothing that really rewards the player. The only ""minigame"" the game has is a fishing game, which is, by the way, how you get easy money later on (fishing the so called ""boss"" fishes). I wish they put more effort in making the areas more interesting. There are places in the game, where there is literally nothing stopping you from walking off the beaten path, except the invisible walls. That was very, very disappointing. There is a cooking system, where you can boost party's attributes. Very basic, but works very well. You can buy equipment, but it's usually a waste of money since most of the time you'll find a better equipment in a chest in the dungeon you're supposed to go. 

[Overall]
8/10 - Besides those negative points, I enjoyed my time with the game, and hope to see more in a next installment.~",1643500808,1643843382,True,0,1,0.453223079442977905,0,True,False,False

Modding the engine to remove the LoD limit and npc / enviroment pop in range makes the game look even better. Huge hit to performance in some areas if you don't have raw power in your machine. I was taking 40-60 fps drops from 144 fps at 1440p with a 3090 and 12900k outside of combat. It was well worth it in my opinion and has nothing else to do with the actual game itself, but it really does make the unique art style stand out more and look even better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, the rest of the game is absolutely disappointing.

- Party members are generic and not enjoyable. 
- Optional skits throughout the world are not only copy pasted and talk about the same things 10 different ways, but extremely long and boring on top of it. 
- Combat is mashy and too easy on anything other than Unknown, but it looks flashy and cool.
 - Story is extremely predictable and boring. Managed to guess ""huge plot twists"" within the first zone of the game lol
- Side content is copy paste the same 2 quests.
- Character development is almost non-existent for everyone except Dohalim. It's all either they don't change or there's a sudden shift in their personality 3/4 the way through the game that should've been slowly built up but instead comes outta no where.
- The ""Big open worlds"" are just hallways with 1 or 2 branching paths to grab a chest or materials.
- Every region is the exact same. You visit the region, something happens to set up the zone. You enter a dungeon, the end of the dungeon is a plot twist of the region. Now go to the lord's castle and kill the lord. Congrats, now go to the next region and do it again in that exact same order with the exact same progression.
- This isn't exactly a Arise problem but a recent Bandai Namco problem in general. It existed in Scarlet Nexus and Code Vein as well. Enemy variety is literally non-existant. You fight the same 6 or so enemies throughout the entire game and they all do the exact same thing, minus mages/sprites due to elemental differences. The wolf or boar you fight as soon as you start the game is the exact same wolf or boar you fight 20 hours into the game. This time they don't even bother reskinning them and it's the literal same model from 20 hours ago but with bigger stats LMFAO.

First I want to mention, that I played Tales of Symphonia, Zestiria and Berseria and after enough hours I hated all of them. I don't like over the top quirky and characters and love the more serious tone here.
As mentioned the story is good, 4 of 6 characters are charming and the combat and graphics are great! Especially the interactions between the first two characters Shionne and Alphen are kinda believable for anime tropes. Everyone knows from the start where this relationship is supposed to go and it's hard to stretch that out until the end of the game but the devs (mostly) succeeded in that! Rinwell and Law have good backstories and interactions, but the longer the game took the more samey it went, so I rushed through their skits after some time. Dohalim and Kisara are boring and bland. Dohalim is a spoiled brat, that tries to be... less spoiled? Kisara has a brother, the end.

The combat system is pretty good, too. It’s fast paced with heavy impact attacks, with characters that have unique skills, although I would have wished for more variety for melee characters. Evading attacks feels great and rewarding, but it can only be used when you’re not locked in an animation. But there’s a mod for canceling animations with evade. One thing I missed here is that older Tales games relied more on elemental weakness and therefor many attacks had some elemental effects. Here they still exist, but only a few skills have those and it isn’t as rewarding to exploit weaknesses. Elements play such a minor role that the standard difficulty setting disables those. Especially Alphen, the guy with the firesword has NO fire skills, besides the ones where he has to use his HP. Law for example can use fireskills without these limitations. And speaking of balancing: Reigning Slash, a skill from Alphen is busted! It does so much more damage than everything else, I used it, ignoring every elemental weakness, because nothing comes close to it and you can spam it.
So I would recommend higher difficulty setting from the start, I played on hard, so it got pretty intense at times but it was doable, with the right preparations.. for you at least. Your companions have a deathwish. I had to disable every action when the enemy used a big attack, so the could conentrate on evading. Even then they don’t move out of dangerzones. The simply try to perfect evade the first tick of damage but as some attacks have multiple damage ticks or cover more ground than the companions can evade, the take it to the face, which often kills them on higher difficulty settings. Sadly you alone have not enough damage to conquer every enemy alone.

So in every aspect there are flaws but what works does so pretty well together. This is no hardcore game however, no system gets really deep but it’s fun nonetheless. One of the best games of 2021 for me.

Oh and the DLC practice is horrible with few very good passive and active skills behind a paywall. Inform yourself on that. It does feel complete though.",1643811072,1643811072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Characters, their designs are pretty good and interactions could be fun, again dynamic in the group starts to build up around hour 5, so watching two planks at the start isn't fun.
- Locations look great, they have variety  but somewhat inconsistent in quality. 
- Waifu simulator, main collectibles are immersion accessories from some cheap hentai game. Yes, you can make your character wear cat/dog etc ears through the whole game.
Negatives:
- Npc interactions lacking... everything, those could be made just into questboards.
- Side quest are the worst fetch quest coming right from mmorpg game.
- Controls are just bad as well as ui, you can't even place a healing potion in a quick slot.
- Aggressive and overpriced dlcs.
- Enemy variety, there is like what 4 enemies  during first four hours.
- The way you meant to learning new skills is broken, my characters are level 12 as well as enemies. You have only 3 slots for active skills. But I have a choice of like 25 to learn, but no there near skill points I need. So even though, there is a lot of skills, you cant take more than three in the battle (you can swap them, but that take you to go pretty deep into the menu), and not enough skill points to learn any.
- Just feels cheap and unpolished sometimes.

 Haven't fall a sleep, has a story and not the worst gameplay... that is a win in my book in 2021.

Pros:
-Graphics
-Music

Minuses:
- A boring fight from which you quickly get tired. You just skip half of the mobs just not to fight them.
- NPC bobbleheads. Even in the games of 2003, NPCs do not stand still AFC.
-Empty corridor levels. Ugly game design. It feels like you are not playing an RPG, but a simulator of a trip from point A to point B.
-Price. This game stands as a AAA project, but in fact, even some schoolchildren's crafts on the unit will be more interesting in terms of gameplay. I wouldn't give $10 for that.

Conclusion:
Better not take this overpriced sh1t. I don't understand why this garbage has so many positive reviews. Looks like people are completely dumb and accustomed to products of this quality.

Ultimately it amounts to a shiny coat of paint on an otherwise bland game. My biggest issue is the difficulty spike at each boss, necessitating either tedious grinding or purchasing a DLC level/experience boost, the latter being incentivized by the tedious grinding. The next is the battle system itself. The system allows you to set up complex combos if you have enough skill, which is great. The problem is enemies can be such damage sponges that it feels defeating to pull off an amazing complex combo, only to see their health bar fall 5%. There are a lot of other minor issues, towns are pretty, but mostly 2D backdrops with little involvement. Character interaction is plentiful but overly melodramatic. Enemy variety mostly comes down to skin color changes. 

All of this together meant after 50-hours of play, I really wasn't having fun and was just hoping it would be over soon. With some fixes, this could be a great game. Re-balance of bosses and the battle system mechanics should be the first priority. Damage sponges aren't fun or a challenge, their just obnoxious.

Everything is told in exposition and the characters constantly explain to the player how they are supposed to be feeling. I had high hopes starting out but level design plays like a PS2 game and doesn't feel next gen at all. Tackling themes of slavery is complex and the story brushes it off in the ""plot twist"" at the end with out any acknowledgment for the reality of dealing with the presumed 300+ years of animosity between the two races. There is also no core antagonist to motivate the characters and the end result is an unfulfilling adventure that looks pretty, but ultimately hollow and forgettable. 

The battle system is interesting at first, but quickly becomes repetitive and devolves into making successive attacks to invoke the boost gauge for the finisher. There is no incentive to explore elemental weaknesses or magic arts as you can get by with spamming the same attacks over again. Strategy consists of you maintaining your healing against the enemies HP. After a certain point, the game gives up and just starts reskinning enemies in the later levels.

When you get to talking about the wilderness the JRPG genre went thru during the darkness of Gen 7, there's a flipside...when a series makes it to the other side and makes a breakthru, it gets a light shown on it they never had before.

Arise was one of those recently. Going with a largely gorgeous watercolory look and sporting DNA from other series like Souls, MMOs, and Character Action games, ToA really hit the big time and mostly earned it.

For being a non-Tatsuro Udo-derived battle system, the aforementioned splicing makes for a good parallel evolution line to complement the Destiny line than the Symphony line. Committing to attacks and stacking % damage makes for alot more fun than managing TP bars, and forces one to concentrate, understand, and prepare, the sign of a good ARPG system.

I liked the choreography and general tone of dialogue. There are strong personalities interacting here, and except for A Certain 4th Realm Scene and Anime Logic veering the plot really close to excusing chattel slavery, we see that Tales cast strength shine. Love me some Dohalim and how the story uses him; he's so interesting and frustrating and pentient in a role that coulda went VERY wrong. Rinwell is a really great 14 yo and her mental journey from shellshocked to smartass as her personal situation improved was wonderful.

Shoutout for asking for Metrics. I'll always tip my hat to that.

A very-much NOT shoutout for doing the Dragon Age Origins Camp Store thing which they finally FINALLY got rid of.

Music was good, not Limiter-Off Sakuraba good (sigh...) but he did good work with the orchestra he was given. That does not extend to the Tiny Tim that blasted out of our speakers every time you went to the main menu early on.

Love the spectacackle of great choreography and brevity-minded Graces f quality supers and dual supers, but the latter was milked too much. I even had a boss not die or do much till I did The Thing Again, which wore out the welcome of Law dunk-punching bullets into the enemies which explode real good. You gotta save that sorta thing.

Not sure what the story was doing with Vholron. I guess he was supposed to be percieved as another Sephiroth? He was a Zagi if anything. Loser.

And one final gripe, the pop-in was excruciatingly bad...unless you modded like us on PC. Not sure why they deemed fit to give Alphen myopia, but modding seemed to have no tradeoffs. It's weird.

Anywho, I'm really looking forward to seeing them fix things and do it without Covid making some things disjointed.

                                                                         Story
    I really like who they are trying to do the story.  They really want you to care about the characters and they want you to explore some hard themes.  They even throw in a plot twist for you.  Now, I think delivery and pacing really hurt the story.

                                                                        Exploration and pacing 
    I think this is where Tales has been hurting for a while.  Sadly, this entry does not fix this.  Guys, if you can't afford open world, world maps work!  A world map creates the illusion of a great distance traveled or a massive world.  Setting the illusion is important.  For example, in TOD.  You get to go on that crust that is slowly covering the world.  In Tales of Eternia, you get to go to both planets and explore them in depth.  It's the same in Tales of Symphonia.  
    Were the worlds actually bigger than what is provided here?  No, they were not bigger.  It just felt grander.  This world feels like a series of small paths.  EVERYTHING is a dungeon basically.  This made the game feel smaller in scope.
                                                                Combat and Grind
    I would like to start by saying that I actually suck at this version of tales.  So, part of this is my fault.  However, they still are killing my mood by slowing my pace down.  Tales has always been about a faster pace.  You could always experience a story at the difficulty that you wanted.  In this game, items are SOOOOOO EXPENSIVE.  To make matters worse, gald is not dropped.  You gotta grind fish or tags to get any money.  Only to spend it all on gels and life bottles.  Then you fight a boss, and it's hard to see any of it's moves unless you play as a ranged char.  Thus, you end up using ALL of your items.  Then, you need to go grind fish or tags again!!!!!!!  It slows the pace of the game down SOOOOOO much.  Octopath was grindy, but you expect that from the type of game it was.  It's more of a game that is trying to capture that Saga vibe.  Tales is more about a fun adventure not a grind.  Grind is usually end-game stuff.  
    K, I'm done.  I don't think I can finish.  I'm just worn out on it.  It's not gonna be my favorite, but it might be yours.  It's not a bad game.  It just hits too many spots wrong for me personally.  

***********************************************************************

  I've still got a long way to go to tell you if it's MY favorite Tales game.  But, I've played enough JRPGs and Tales to know what this one is about already.
     To start, if your a fan of open world RPGs and don't really like JRPGs too much, I don't think this Tales game is going to change your mind.  It's not open world and it still plays like Tales have always played.  It just has higher production value in it.
    Now, if your a Tales fan, I can't tell you that this game is going to be the definitive Tales game for you.  It's not really any better or worse than past entries in the series.  I can say that you'll probably like it if you like Tales games.  
    First off, it has higher production value than many of the past games.  BNamco really wanted this one to stick out and sell higher than usual.  The graphics are good and there is a lot more voiced dialogue than usual.
     The story is like other games in the franchise.  The writing is hit or miss like usual.  The story seems to really want to be less comical than usual and be a bit more serious, but it's still a standard story for Tales.  If you've liked the story telling that they have done in the past, you'll like it here also.  If you hate the stories in these games and just wanna kill stuff, you'll probably feel the same here.
    The exploration is like Graces to current Tales games.  There is no world map.  It's just zones and dungeons.  Thus far, the dungeons are just pathways with no puzzles or such like Symphonia.  Maybe this changes later?  Characters have their own field actions which will play a part in navigating dungeons and maps.
     Combat in this game is smooth.  It offers a lot but as of yet does not have weird things to get used to like in the past two games.  The leveling and skill system is done well also.  
     Theres also a blacksmith and crafting.  Though it seems to be quite simple at the moment and no making + weapons.  I'm not seeing randomly generated weapon perks either.  Personally, I hope this gets more advanced as the game progresses.  Right now, it's just not enough for me.
     There you have it.  A good Tales game.  Will it be my favorite?  Not sure yet.",1641078000,1643486895,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

---CONS---
1- The story goes way too fast, and I easily predicted most of it...

2- The difficulty is all over the place, some boss (always around my level) I can beat untouched without breaking a sweat on hard, others I get completely blasted by on the Very easy difficulty, which is itself a free DLC because of the ""story"" difficulty is too hard.
The last boss of a game is supposed to be the ultimate test of everything you have learned along the way, being game mechanics, attack timings, combos... Yet, this last boss is painfully easy and you will not be tested.

3- So many crashes. A lot of cutscenes just crashes in the middle, its generally the long cutscene that happen after bosses, but the autosave happens to be AFTER the cutscene, so if it does crash, too bad fight the boss again.

4- SINGLEPLAYER, this is an absolute shame that they didn't bother to add multiplayer coop like in pretty much every other Tales of games. There is NO valid reason for it, the gameplay would 100% work, I just think they didn't bother to save money.

5- The writting needs some work. There are quite often moments where character references something that never existed in their world and entire life (like theater as an example), and it makes absolutely no sense at all and break the immersion. Also there are lots of moments where a character learns something and progress emotionally, but there its as if it never happend 5 minutes later, just absolutely weird.

---PROS---
1- The combat is pretty good, its diffinitelly enjoyable, but sometimes enemies are WAY too tanky and it becomes a grind.

2- Great arte user (mage) gameplay

3- The story itself isn't all that bad, but it definitelly borrows a lot from other Tales of games.",1642397010,1643422594,False,2,0,0.483967781066894531,0,True,False,False

Flaws:
Holy mother, the story fucking sucks. Like not only is it stupidly basic, but at times it just seems like they are holding your hand the whole time and explaining everything. Even shit that is totally obvious. Maybe because I am high when I play this game, I dunno, but I stopped paying attention to it as soon as I almost finished the second area.

Second, the characters. OMG are they insufferable. Like REALLY insuffurable. Everytime Shionne or Alphen opens their mouth I want to scratch the roof of my mouth with a shotgun. Like yes Shionne is a Renan, they are high class, they are snobby, awful people etc etc. And yet not only does she embodies that and yet her attitude is just so unexcusable. I really don't understand how someone can be so unlikable. One minute she is helpful and gets along with the other characters, and in a flash she does a complete 180 and acts like a c unt. Seriously. It's a pattern at this point. The party have a cutscene and some personal exposition, and out of nowhere just acts like cunt. And repeat. Alphen is boring and a 2 faced asshole. However, maybe because I'm high as hell, I like it though. It's so bad that it's good.

The main premise of two worlds with one oppressing the other is very reminiscent of Tales of Symphonia, so naturally you start to expect something equally impactful. However, it doesn't have the wonder or vastness Symphonia has. 

For example, without spoiling anything, the story takes you through 5 regions to liberate plus another info dump and dungeon basically. Not only is it pretty linear, each region is also pretty small and follows a set structure. You arrive, see some events, do a dungeon to see the twist and then do the castle dungeon with the boss. Instead of different factions/kingdoms/worlds with their own agendas where you end up being tossed in the middle, you just slash yourself through some bad guys until there are no more. It was also advertised as an open world game, but the fields in each area are pretty small. The map is also filled immediately as you enter them, so it's not like there's any exploration. Even without markers, you can spot items hidden on the map just by its design.

Then there's the battle system. It kind of works, but the limited number of artes you can equip at a time really hold it back. Especially if you want to play a mage since you can only equip 6 spells at a time, which is as much to work with as Phantasia gave you 20 years ago. The enemy variety is also atrocious, possibly one of the worst I've ever seen. You will only really fight a handful of different enemies: Bears, wolves, elementals, hawks, boars, plants and some more. Each enemy only has one elemental affinity, which determines their weakness and resistance and each species is weak to the boost attack of one character that can down them. This not only makes everything a lot more repetitive, it also makes every area feel the same.
There's another small thing that bothers me with the battle system: It counteracts itself. If you manage to fill a certain gauge by comboing, you can execute them with boost strikes. Bosses have mandatory boost strikes at 50% and the end of the fight. The problem is that boost strikes use the same input as boost attacks, which also have the secondary benefit of replenishing your CP that are used to do artes. So, to extend your combos, which is especially important as a mage, you want to do a boost attack every now and then, but if it accidentally becomes a boost strike, your combo ends and you have to start over. I think that mainly affects those who want to play Rinwell since she can shorten her casting time to almost nothing by comboing.

The rest in a bullet list:
- Cities are completely forgettable as everything you ever need is in the inn. Quest markers are shown as soon as you can start them, so you only make a beeline for them. There's absolutely no reason to go through a city again later on, let alone talk to the NPCs there.
- Skits are pretty long conversations instead of little comments sprinkled across the game. They also always come at once, so when you want to progress, you suddenly have several long skits thrown into your face. Doesn't help that characters oftentimes repeat themselves.
- Basically no ruins or ancient dungeons to explore, everything is just made for this one main conflict. That's especially bad considering that Rinwell (and Dohalim to some degree) are very into history and artifacts. There's a lot of potential wasted just there.
- Sidequests are almost all just boring slay or fetch quests. There are one or two exceptions, but that's it. 
- Rinwell's spell list is a joke. Even some of her mid level spells are locked behind quests from after the 5th region. For easily over half the game she'll only have 4 attack spells and then suddenly get the rest. Even then, she can only use three elements plus the basic fire spell. 
- Characters can hardly bloom thanks to the short story and small world. I already mentioned Rinwell's problem, but Shionne has a similar one, where she takes a while to warm up and sort out her issues. Sadly this ""while"" is almost half the game already. Dohalim is pretty much the only satisfying character.
- Skill trees don't give you anything special. All you get are new artes and improvements to mechanics like better dodges.",1643222697,1643222697,False,123,11,0.575054645538330078,7,True,False,False

[b] TL;DR [/b]
Tales of Arise is a wonderful entry into the Tales series that I think veterans of the series and newcomers alike can find things that they like about the game. Combat is fluid, visuals are stunning, the music is wonderful, story is alright, and the characters are interesting (especially so if you go out of your way to do subquests). Is it worth full price? Sure, if anime-trope-styled JRPG's are your thing. Do I think that it's a must-play? Not really, because I do have some personal grievances with how some characters and plot points were written along with combat system difficulty (or lack thereof). But most importantly is it fun? Absolutely. I thought that the game through and through was an enjoyable experience that I feel comfortable recommending.

[u] [b] The Pros: [/b] [/u]

[b] Graphics: [/b]
The world and graphics in Tales of Arise is fantastic. The art direction is an immense leap away from prior Tales-of entries and it really shows. Environments feel unique to their respective areas and they don't ever feel like they're just a copy-and-paste deal. 

[b] Combat: [/b]
Combat in this game feels incredibly fluid and responsive. That being said, the game seems to have a hard time figuring out how difficult it wants itself to be. I started and finished the game on hard mode, so I'll give my take based on that. At the beginning the game was reasonably difficult. However, some bosses, mostly very early on, felt particularly difficult without item spam. This, however, changed drastically as the game progressed and soon even bosses that should have given me a hard time ended up being fairly easy to deal with. This is both a pro and a con in a way depending on how much of a challenge you really want out of the game. The game does offer difficulties beyond hard, however, if you're looking for something gut-wrenchingly difficult. That being said, for people looking to just experience their first Tales-of title, then this would be an excellent starting point. The game features a manual, semi-auto, and auto battle system so you can enjoy and play at your leisure.

[b] Characters: [/b]
In Tales of Arise you follow the story of six characters: Alphen, Shionne, Rinwell, Law, Kisara, and Dolahim. Each character comes from a unique background and you get to learn more about them as the story progresses. The game fleshes out these characters further in little mini-cutscenes called ""skits"" that play out when you meet certain conditions. I personally felt that some of the characters were very well-written, but needed an extra push to really have them come into their own. More on that later.

[b] Story: [/b]
The story is interesting enough. The lore-building of Dahna and Rena as well as their respective peoples' history is genuinely engaging and you can see that history reflected throughout the people you meet as well as your own party. There's a lot in the main story to be sure, but sub-quests offer a  nice reprieve from the main storyline and many of them are honestly really interesting as they give you a further glimpse into the stories of the side characters you come across in your journey.

[b] BGM: [/b]
Motoi Sakuraba returns again to fill yet another Tales entry with absolute bangers. If the name is unfamiliar to you, he's worked on many other Tales games but has also worked on games such as Dark Souls and Star Ocean. The music in the game is a treat for the ears. Every piece really fits in its perfectly from blood-pumping battle music to somber tones to reflect desolate conditions. 

[b] Sub Quests: [/b]
The game offers you a plethora, 70 if memory serves, optional sub quests that you can take part in throughout the game. These subquests range from collecting things to slaying gigants (really big monsters). However, many of these subquests offer you a glimpse into the daily lives of the citizens of whatever region you happen to be in. Some of these sub quests actually give you more backstory into the side characters that you encounter and essentially ""closes"" the chapter on their loose ends in the story. If you're like me and you want to learn more about the side characters and what becomes of them after story progression, you'll want to do these quests and they're well worth it. 

[u] [b] The Cons: [/b] [/u]

[b] Characters: [/b]
I know, this was a pro, but it's also a con. Every member of the main cast feels like they're really solid as characters. However, as the story progressed, they somewhat lose that luster and fall into tried-and-true cliches that make them feel that much less interesting. To be perfectly honest, by the end-game and post-game, I was far more engaged with learning about all the side characters than I was with the main cast. That isn't to say cliches are bad, mind you, but I feel like with how interesting they are during the first act of the game, they just sort of lose steam at the end.

[b] Story: [/b]
I thought that for all the good the story had, the pacing was a bit awkward. Some story points felt a little bit forced and I feel as though they really wanted the game to  play out like an anime. Which is fine for a lot of people, but made some plot points either fall flat or lack any real impact/""wow"" factor.
[b] SPOILERS, VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK[/b]
[spoiler]There's a point in the story where the focus shifts from the Dahnan-Renan conflict to everyone being puppeteered by some cosmic eldritch entity known as the ""Great Astral Spirit of Rena"" along with an alien race being introduced called the ""Helganquil."" This twist really felt like it came out of left field and took the wind out of my sails as I really thought the whole ""Red Woman"" mystery was going to be more than just ""ancient alien race"" shenanigans. It almost felt like a cop-out plot twist to shoehorn a final big-bad in. Which is unfortunate because the point at which you're revealed to the fact that the Red Woman has been around the lords in-game and she's actually present in the cutscenes really makes you think ""holy shit how did I miss that???"" and it's a really cool thing that I feel like could have led up to something bigger. [/spoiler]

[b] My Verdict?[/b]

While I thoroughly enjoyed the well balanced combat system and fishing mini game (that's really the only mini game there is to play, surprisingly), the pacing suffers from being a little too quick and the story beats tedious. If you loathed games like FF13, approach Tales of Arise with caution..the first 30-40 hours feel similar. It feels like an elaborate introduction that covers all game play basics, while warming you up to the world locations and main themes presented. 

The character development is lopsided..we only watch our protagonists grow and change over the duration of the story while the antagonists remain one dimensional and ambiguous until end game..really unfortunate. A lot of missed opportunities to enhance the narrative,  and a plot that often felt predictable and ultimately lazy in how it resolves itself.  

Despite these glaring issues, I really enjoyed the time I spent playing Tales of Arise. Like most Tales games, I feel like this one is meant to be savored for the game play, primarily. The characters are likeable and relatable, though archetypal. The plot is comparable to a dozen other similar or better JRPGS, but has enough unique qualities and a strong art direction to help it stand out. 

Definitely a steal at $30 or under. I paid full price at launch day and don't really regret it. Though I've yet to play and beat Vesperia or Berseria, I'd say it's up there with the greats of the series. 8.5 outta  10, you heard it from me.",1643012722,1643012925,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The story is amazing, and is one of my favourites in the series. It has solid pacing, some truly unexpected twists, and incredible character development across the entire main cast (especially the two leads). And it all culminates in a very satisfying, well-deserved ending.

It is certainly one of those kinds of games that gets better the longer you play it. Combat can take a bit of getting used to, especially compared to other entries in the series. But as you progress through the game, acquire new moves and unlock new skills it really starts to settle in how good the combat flow feels and how satisfying it is to defeat some of the tougher bosses and enemies. It is certainly one of the nicest feeling and free-flowing combat systems the series has to offer.

Tales of Arise is also different from the rest of the series in that it is actually relatively easy to get 100% completion on, compared to other Tales of entries. There isn't any real missable content in this game, unlike previous games, and everything can be enjoyed at your own pace as you clear all of the additional post-game content. That said, once you experience everything, that's about it. There isn't much need to carry over to a New Game+ file unless you want to replay through the main story or do a challenge run of some kind. Personally I'm fine with this as it avoids the game from being [i]too[/i] much of a time sink, but of course for some people your mileage may vary.

Dislike:
DLC for outfits.  Really....WOW there even overpriced jeez.
Weapons have skins but Armor you pickup does not.  BOO!

My biggest complaint.  Combat Strategy for now single player only Tales game lacks targeting arguments.  (Target My Target/Target Lowest HP/ Target Highest HP/ Stay Close to Enemy/Stay Far From Enemy/ Etc...)  For a single player game I have to rely on the AI for I need more control.  This is forgivable with multiplayer but not for single player experience and makes it harder to build combo's for finishers.  Maybe I just overlooked it but I did not find this in the combat styles for AI behavior.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall the content felt balanced and very enjoyable.  At times there were long skits of story followed by running around to each character and having to talk to them after already listening to cut-scenes.  I started skipping this story dialog a bit because I can only handle so much story at once so maybe keep the spacing sparse throughout with story/action and only heavy during the start and ending but it was not too bad and did not detract at these times too much.

One thing I will say is there is a definite skill gap you will have to over come when it comes to using your Astral Art efficiently and effectively to get most out of your combos to deal maximum damage. I like how the game punished the player for spamming the same attach over and over. It forced me learn how to use effective combos and how to perfectly dodge to avoid damage to over come some of the harder fights in the game.

The battle system is also the best one in the series, I'd give it 9/10. Very deep system with lots of mechanics, helped by being able to freely switch between party members (without having to go to pause menu) to chain combos. Combat dialogue between the characters do get repetitive though. And fights can often get too visually chaotic when there are lots of artes going off at the same time (and everyone is simultaneously shouting off the names of their attacks).

The story is 7/10. I liked the overall premise and major plot twist in the final chapters, but the pacing and delivery could have been done a lot better. The cast is pretty strong, albeit not as strong as Berseria's. They each have serviceable character arcs, but where they really shine is in their skits and conversations with each other. That's where the best writing is to be found IMO. Party member chemistry done right.

Length is okay, considering the world is much more contained and there's a direct fast travel feature this time round, available right from the start. The main story takes about ~50 hours if you do everything you possibly can, and the post-game content is about another 8 to 10 hours.

Cons:
The DLC. Literally, this alone almost made me want to not buy the game. The dlc is down right scummy to the point of being able to buy actual level ups. It feels like an experiment to determine just how far they could go before people get pissed. That being said, the dlc is not really pushed or mentioned at all in game. I think there's maybe one menu option to view available dlc, but otherwise you'd never notice it. 

The game itself is fine without the dlc buffs or skills locked behind classes. All plays wonderfully and is enjoyable so it's just mind boggling as to why they would sell these.

Only other con really is the same enemy variants basically repeat throughout the game just reskinned to the unique element or theme of that region.

This is the most fun I've had in a Tales game on the basis of having genuinely fun battle encounters, whereas most Tales games they're kinda a snoozefest. The game's bosses are not well designed around the combat system either. The CP system is just awful and makes difficulties above Normal a chore, while Normal is lacking in difficulty. Battle animations are super good at least.

The story has some highs, but it's overloaded with exposition at parts, and its characters are fine but far from Tales' best. Their skits are great, but the story lacks subtlety outside of a couple parts of the midgame. The final act of this game (about the last quarter so of it) ranges from awkward to outright trash. 

I like Arise and think it's better than the sum of its parts, but I hope with whatever BAMCO does for their next Tales of game builds on the good ideas of this one with actually fun boss fights and a final act that doesn't feel like they somehow crammed half the game into a single chapter while also somehow being jarringly slow paced due to its exposition dump nature.

The chemistry between the main cast is great and believable. Most of the romances are satisfying to watch grow except for one pairing where it comes out of nowhere. The story is serviceable, but was rather poor when I had given some thought after it. There are issues for me however. The game does not give you a recommended level for side quests or main quests. There are quite a few times in the game where you are in an area that has enemies that are really under leveled but there is a boss that has almost 10+ levels over you. And the quality of bosses takes a nose dive after the 2nd big boss of the game. They all become really easy to beat and figure out. Also the companion AI sometimes does not follow the strategies you set for them. I set them to get away from the enemy but instead they got right up to their faces and die because they are so close to them. I do like this game a lot despite the things that hold it back.

Concerning the story...Does it really depart much from what you might call the standard Tales formula? 
No, no it doesn't.
A grand quest to save the world, element-themed regions and monsters, a hero with a past so mysterious even he doesn't know it, a main heroine with a terrible ailment to be fixed by the end of the game, artes-based combat mechanics...and quite a few other similarities to past Tales games will be easily noticed in this one. 

But let's face it - these staples are why we play Tales games. I felt at times like I knew where the story was going before it got there, but I still found the main party characters likable, and there were one or two plot twists or character revelations that surprised me by the end. It's a good save-the-world story with themes of slavery, liberation, prejudice, greed, poverty, injustice, mercy, and forgiveness. The combat was fun and the various artes looked great and made each character feel powerful as you were playing them. It wasn't really ground-breaking in terms of character and story, but I don't feel it needed to be. It just needed to be a fun Tales game, and in my opinion, it definitely was.

I've never really been a huge fan of the ""Tales of"" franchise, but I decided to give Tales of Arise a try after watching gameplay trailers. Needless to say, I've been having a blast with it. The story is pretty ""standard"" of a JRPG; liberate the world. This is told through a very character driven story, which I'm enjoying thus far. The characters have pretty distinct personalities and motives, and although their circumstances force them together into a party, their interactions do not feel as such. Listening to characters talk to one another is not a chore, and it's actually interesting to see how each character is developing in tandem with their party members.

The combat system is pretty simple to get into, but there is a surprising amount of depth to be found without it actually becoming overwhelming. The separation of healing artes and combat artes into separate resources is such a great design choice. While you don't have to sacrifice combat power for healing and vice versa, the resource management required for both is enough to keep me on the edge of my seat during boss battles. Speaking of, the boss battles in this game are greatly designed. They aren't too bullshit, but they aren't that much of a snooze either. Your party will die several times on even Normal difficulty if you just jump in expecting to button mash your way through some of them. Some of these fights do require a little grinding beforehand, but it isn't a chore thanks to how flashy and dynamic this game's combat is.

Overall, I recommend Tales of Arise to any fans of JRPGs or high-speed action games. There's definitely something here if you want a character driven story and/or crazy over the top combat.",1642589385,1642589385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my least favorite game in the Tales series by far, replacing Zestiria. I have plenty of good things to say about Zestiria, I just thought the plot was generic. I still loved the characters, listening to their conversations, exploring their world, and fighting alongside the heroes. Not only would I not say that for Arise ... I actually can't. 

This game features my least favorite characters in my least favorite story, not just in Tales, but across any RPG I have ever played over 25+ years of gaming. I have NEVER requested a refund from Steam -- I would typically find a way to at least try and get something out of it -- but this time I just can't. I played this game around 7 hours and unlocked 3 playable characters, with a 4th one about to be revealed.

Gameplay
Iron Mask/Alphen's combos were kinda decent. Combining normals and artes to make my own attack strings just worked. Shionne's combat style is very clunky. For someone ranged, it felt disjointed and did not flow well. She can shoot her own grenades, which is kind of interesting, but probably best to leave her on AI control. Rinwell felt okay, she did have one interesting mechanic, but mostly just choose a spell and charge. Sometimes simple and straightforward is best.
Cure Points are bad. This system kind of makes sense for the overworld use of the blazing sword, but detracts from the game's combat and just makes healing via magic incredibly tedious. Why am I being punished for using healing magic?
Also, I really struggled against the first boss, as the encounter relies on a perfect dodge mechanic to avoid taking damage. I think it's okay for a game to be difficult, but I was not expecting something like this so early on. I think the game must have expected players to grind more than I was willing to, because my characters were half of the boss' level.  

If you've played other Tales games: 
Alphen plays like Asbel (Graces) with more customization and flexibility in combo execution. If you liked Asbel's gameplay, I think you will enjoy playing as Alphen. 
Shionne is a ranged attacker with magic artes. She is kind of similar to Pascal (Graces) or Lailah (Zestiria), but her combat style doesn't feel very fluid, switching between normals, combat artes, and magic artes. 
Rinwell is a mage who's normals are magic attacks and follows the ""magic charging"" style for her artes. No gimmicks as with mages like Rowen or Elise (Xilia), but she does seem to have a light/thunder arte that can be quick cast after a charge arte. Kind of interesting, I didn't get to explore it much. 

Music
Gets the job done but nothing to write home about. Gives me a Star Ocean vibe. Tries to be impressive with heavy orchestrals but lacks substance. I did not like the opening title song. 

Characters
Iron Mask is terribly generic. Tropes are not intrinsically bad, but he was very much a paint-by-numbers. Secret identity (that will almost definitely be featured in a major plot point), wants to be a hero for the sake of being a hero, only cares about ""freedom"" and ""combat"". Has an ability that inextricably ties him to the female lead so they're the only ones for one another. Definitely the worst character from what I saw, Ray Chase was absolutely wasted on this. Terrible writing. 

Shionne can be pretty funny, but her bitchiness is really over the top and unnecessary most of the time. I'm sure she will eventually grow to trust the Dahnans and be more comfortable with being emotionally vulnerable (her character flaw amateurishly baked directly into her abilities), but I don't find her compelling enough to want to stick around and see that plainly obvious story play out. 

Story
This is my biggest issue. Other reviewers that have gotten further along than me have ripped this story apart in detail, so I can't add much more but this: 

This game, which features all kinds of zany anime hijinks, from a series chock-full of zany anime hijinks, is about the liberation of a race of people that have been enslaved for hundreds of years. 

The writers of this story were too inept to handle this topic with any respect, and I'm sorry but you would have to be heartless to listen to speeches about the evils of slavery one second, just to turn around the next second and hunt down an anime owl in disguise and pick up your goofy costume pieces (like bunny tails and swirly lens glasses). It just pisses me off. 

Look, I absolutely love Tales for what it is, but the writing team clearly did not have anything meaningful to say on this topic, and wrote the most barebones story for the least interesting characters this series has ever seen. This game was just so, so stupid. 

If you've never played a Tales game, this is NOT the place to start. Please, please play Xillia instead. Or Berseria (playing Zestiria first is nice but optional). Or Graces (childhood arc is really good, it's 2 hours but skipping it is a disservice to those characters, they're a little hard to like otherwise). Or Vesperia. Or literally anything else. Forget Tales altogether if you have to, play Persona 4. Seriously, skip this one - the 91% positive reviews have got to be bots, they're all things like ""it's a JRPG - recommend"".

I pretty much softlocked myself from completing a questline thanks to selling a weapon and now its always there... may start a fresh new game because of that... beat all 5 lords and I found out its only a part of the game since there was a second opening after I beat the fifth lord... nuff said... this game is insane but expect long fights with damage sponge bosses... things get better after the spoiler free moment *Hint hint the earth lord* but until than... do three things... keep weapons upgraded when you are able... grind certain items from knights of various lords till you have more than enough to make multiple weapons... and finally... make good accessories... my game was slow until I learned that using accessories changed many things!

Again... spoiler free so can't say much about the story but just sit back, enjoy the story and just enjoy it for what it is and you'll be immersed in the game... not the same impact as a few tales of stories but better than some... won't lie its personal tastes for drama and stuff... finally... and this is a warning for an early quest... do not fight the massive mantis monster after you get a bit into the game... fight it when you either beat the five lords or get by the five lords... that monster is in the 40's and you first get the quest when your less than level 10... saves you the trouble of trying to die since you cannot run from special large monster battles...

Anyway enjoy the game, its impressive in looks, characters, and performance since I barely get any issues performance wise... wait for a sale though even with the base editition of the game because the other versions of this game are not worth it for the prices... wait for sales before buying and research the game a little before you do consider buying it.",1642526422,1642526422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There, if you don't feel like reading the rest of this you now have my opinion. Anyway, the reasons for this are many, from a baffling lack of balance to average to terrible writing and the lack of a series-staple feature. 

[h1] Combat and Balance [/h1] 
First off there's combat, arguably the reason I like Tales of in the first place, it's a bit of a mess, sure at first it feels snappy and quick, but problems quickly surface. The damage your characters put out is laughable for the vast majority of artes with only one or two standouts. The main character, Alphen, might qualify as the weakest protagonist in the series' history with most of his moves doing little damage, moving him out of place for follow-up attacks, or having long windups with little payoff. Although the damage part isn't relegated to him as it's a party-wide issue, as is the lack of reliable, damage-dealing artes. Enemies, by comparison, never want for damage and will frequently one-shot your characters, at appropriate level, from full-health. Some boss fights that clearly want you to interrupt deadly charge artes simply cannot have this task fulfilled as you just can't output that kind of damage fast enough to satisfy the conditions. I also cannot speak of the combat without mentioning the elephant in the room. For whatever reason, from lack of care to just plain refusal to spend money programming such a feature, Tales of Arise has no multiplayer. Period. Which is something the series has had since its inception on the Super Nintendo, with the only exception having been a handful of titles on the DS and some PSP ports, systems that would have trouble managing local co-op. It's obvious Bandai wants Tales to become more action and less RPG, but its current course is tearing the game apart, as long wind-downs from artes clashes with the high damage of enemy attacks.

[h1] Story and Writing [/h1] 
The story, and writing in general, is a bit of a wash, the first act is passable and enjoyable to some extent, but things just sort of... fall apart around the second half. Honestly I started skipping scenes as I found the characters too dull to entertain my interest. Skits are in-engine, instead of being their own art segments, which on one hand is neat, as it allows accessories and costumes to appear, but the comic-book panel style they have comes across as messy and doesn't really allow for the little touches that made skits in Vesperia or other Tales enjoyable.

[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
The graphics are fine, not great, just fine. The character models still look like they're from the old Tales engine and the ground looks weirdly muddy in a sort of badly done cel-shaded way to me. But other than that I have no real issues here.

[h1] Miscellaneous [/h1] 
Other issues I do have include the baffling decision to make gels a flat heal, like potions from Final Fantasy, which if I didn't know better was Bandai's biggest reason for jumping to the Unreal Engine. Alongside making gels absurdly expensive and at the same time hamstringing your income until a mid-game feature is unlocked, and that requiring grinding it to achieve the income you will certainly need for weapons, armor, accessories, and items. The addition of CP as a sort of heal-only TP and field action tax isn't a terrible choice, but with orange gels at 3,000 a pop combined with the flat-heal HP gels, I can't say that the changes... gel well together. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1] 
So, after all that would I say Arise is worth buying if the above issues don't phase you? Not at $60, or even $50, but if you can find it for $30 or less then yes, I'd say ToA will probably hold your interest, or at least not make your wallet sting too badly from the price of admission. I'd say that ToA almost comes across as Bandai dipping its toe into UE4 and putting out the resulting test game, with decidedly mixed results. But it's not all bad, the missing multiplayer feature has already been fixed by a modder working in their spare time, the wind-down animations can also be fixed with the arte canceler mod, as can the balancing with another mod. Which, if anything, is the best part of the new Tales engine, as UE4 itself is easily moddable, at least compared to the old Tales engine, making it perhaps the brightest silver lining of all.",1642513503,1642513503,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

I've never seen such a beautifully-crafted cringe-inducing abomination. Its like if Studio Ghibli animated a Roland Emmerich script. So full of cliches and 1-dimensional characters that it boggles the mind to think people got paid to write this. If Mr. Fantastic from Fallout: New Vegas was the lead writer, then it'd make sense. The first 20 hours or so of gathering your party and establishing the world is all decent, but once you go to space (yes, really) it takes an incredible nose-dive.

[spoiler] There is literally no main villain. There are bosses, but every time you beat one another one pops up that was pulling the last-one's strings, all the way until the end where the Big Bad is literally just the manifestation of Hate in physical form. And to beat that, the MC literally ""calls on the will of Danha (the planet)"" and it pans to past NPCs looking at the sky with light essence wisps flowing around into the sky. I wanted to vomit/die/vomit so hard I'd die. [/spoiler]

The combat was the hook that drove me to kept playing. The battle system lets you learn and unlock different skills and artes to level up with, but you will probably stick with the same three or four attacks for your main character over the course of the game. Despite overusing the same attacks, you can still find yourself adjusting to the difficulty of certain boss fights or enemies, so the game is not just simply button-mashing your way to victory (most of the time). It was really fun regardless and I enjoyed the simplicity.

The story is essentially a Hero / Chosen One trope where he rises up with his followers to overthrow bad guys and has to save the world. I personally don't mind stories like these and quite frankly, Tales of Arise's story is forgettable. The only reason why I was eager to follow the story were the characters. I liked the chemistry when the party members interact with each other. I also wanted to see how Shionne's story progressed over the course of the game and I thought her arc had a decent ending. I didn't really care too much about the rest of the characters because I thought they were ""okay"" and I couldn't really relate to them. There was Dohalim's story and background which I found the most interesting one out of the cast, but nothing more.

It really was the characters interactions with each other and their progression through the story, on top of an addicting combat system, that kept me playing. If you like ""Hero / Chosen One"" story tropes, character interactions with each other over the course of the game, modern JRPGs, or addicting combat, then give Tales of Arise a try.

Its not a bad game but I am not enjoying it.

I am not enjoying the writing for the story or characters. Most of the dialogue makes me cringe because the things they say make no sense or their reactions are so over the top.

The combat is okay but I am not a fan of it. It is based on a break system where you do very little damage to enemies until you combo them enough (which can fail if you cant chain enough attacks from all 4 characters) or use a boost attack (which has a timer) to break their defence at which point you one shot them with a special move.

The majority of the level design is corridor based and there isnt much to see or do other than run towards the next star on the map. Some of the area's open up a bit and have optional area's but they are too few and far between.

The skit scenes have been changed to a storyboard format and the majority of the cutscenes now use ingame graphics (cell shaded). I preferred the animated scenes from previous games as I found them more entertaining.

29 hours into it and I am struggling to push through to the end. Hopefully the story will have an interesting twist somewhere.

Edit:
Played through to the end and I still wouldn't recommend it.

The story picks up a bit towards the end but the characters were never enjoyable (until the final credits scene).

The combat I would argue is worse in the late game due to the terrible AI. Toward the end you fight more and more boss type enemies with cone/AOE attacks, the AI isn't capable of recognising them and will continue to throw their lives away by running head first into the attacks.

Its absurd that the combo system requires all your party to focus attacks and the game doesn't have an option to set them to all attack the same target automatically.

I spent the whole final dungeon (hours of game play) spamming the same light spell over and over as it was the most reliable form of damage.

tl;dr great story, solid characters and worldbuilding, and outstanding combat. Definitely recommend giving it a try!

 Storyline starts off a bit slow, but really picks up a couple hours in and is probably one of the best written stories I've seen for a game in recent years.
 
The characters all have their own backstory and meaningful progression/development, which makes all of them likable. Side quests aren't your standard fetch quests meant to give the game 100 ""extra"" hours of filler. Rather, they may have you get something, but it's in a dangerous area. Or kill something because it's being a nuisance. To top it off, the rewards are always worth it!

Lastly, the combat! Oh man I can go on and on. Probably the most fun I've had with an action JRPG since Infinite Undiscovery (can't say RPG, because Souls games too good). Take FFXV's combat system and add 100x more eye candy, and you get this. You can pick a mage, monk, warrior, tank, whatever role, and have a blast. Enemies have real counters and stronger ones WILL punish you if you don't use your abilities to capitalize on them. 

All in all, really satifying game. I hope they come out with future content or take this winning formula and run with it in the future. I'll be in (metaphorically) in line waiting for the next one :)",1642304037,1642304037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Love their little fire talks and the way it looks like a graphic novel.

Combat system is complete garbage. It's not entirely action/slasher and not enouigh tactics turn-based, it's somewhere in between, and really bad. All mobs and bosses are crazy sponges.

There are some good things: 
- graphics and player animations are great, 
- optimization is really nice (it won't drop bellow 60fps even once on maxed 1080p on old gtx 1060 6GB),
- leveling system, gear management, accessory modding and cooking systems are ok (even if there is only 1 slot for armour and 1 slot for accessory), 
- level design - while being primitive PSX/PS2 jrpg corridor runner filled with monsters and scattered treasures - is somehow fun to explore and locations looks goddamn pretty (until You hit trash rushed second half of game about which I'll write later), 
- party members and their interactions are enjoyable, 
- ''middle'' part of the story is great, 
- combat mechanics are goddamn fun and responsive - especially perfect dodge mechanics was brilliant idea, You can chain special moves freely, there is nice aerial movement and fighting too, 
- fast travel from anywhere to majority of locations just from menu is good for QoL design (there is no overworld like in majority of tales games - locations are just linked together)... 

...but bad things oh man... 
- story overall is freaking mess - starts slow and boring then at middle it became a gigachad and gets interesting and then - after greeting You with hype 2nd anime intro of act 2 - it goes downhill in quality in supersonic speed... Pacing slows down, things gets boring as hell, skits got repeated over and over again about same topics, You got 1 hour exposition dump of dialogues (!!!) slapped in Your face by lazy writers and then fu player go fight final boss on planet built from 2 types of corridors copy pasted over and over again and then expierience dissapointing ending lmao
- 90% of skits are just annoying dialogues of party members being full of self-pity, power of friendship etc. - there are some funny and interesting ones but sadly You need to go through tons of junk to expierience them,
- sidequests are just junk fetchquests - kill monster, give 5 tomato, give 10 eggs... Yes - 99% of sidequests are like that in 2021 RPG GOTY :/ In some of them dialogues and character interactions saves the day and rewards makes them worth doing so You will still want to do them all, 
- enemy variety is godawful - about 10 enemy types copy-pasted-recoloured over and over again through whole game...
- enemy battle design - AI is goddamn braindead spam random attacks design, enemies whiff their attacks without even reaching You, they lack any legit defensive, mobility and evasive tools, enemies animations and graphics quality compared to player ones is just poor, there is no pressure from enemies You can always move back and heal without any risk - combat system is fine but it won't unleash all potential because how badly designed enemies are... 
- bosses are disgrace - many of them are just bigger variants of standard enemies, unique ones are dumb as hell uninteresting design which can't even react to standing in one place and spamming attacks in their butthole or can't reach You if You stay at contrary border of arena... also there are many bigger bosses which serves just as combat arena background while You fight waves of trash mobs and boss just die after killing few of mentioned waves...
- generic music - 3-4 nice tracks and rest are just meh ''something is playing in background but my ears don't care'' type of music and of course second half of game downgrades also hit soundtrack - Thank God there is a mod which restores best track of the game (combat theme) which got replaced by some awful tune later in game...
- amount of backtracking gets tiring,
- copy-paste same looking underground corridor over and over again level design of second half of game is just insulting,
- post game content is just wast of time - 1st quest is dungeon with copy pasted and recoloured stuff again and some edgy annoying cameo characters without any challenge and 2nd one is boss rush fight where You fight 5 previously seen bosses + 1 old but new opponent but he is just boring design lvl100 easy HP sponge,
- controller vibrations aren't working,
- world is lifeless static mess, towns are just corridors with bunch of buildings with standing in one place NPCs everywhere,

5/10 at best. 9/10 reviews seen everywhere are just unfunny jokes. Game with so many bad aspects isn't even close to be 9/10. 

Notice: I've played with solo Alphen (You can move all party members to support squad only with Cheat Engine), ng+ save file to get and use 2x damage taken/2x damage dealt, 2x exp, 2x sp, more ore mined and skip enemy detection artifacts and also I've used steel's difficulty tweak mod edited with mod tools for my own tastes to make enemies more aggressive but less tanky - normal difficulty edited with 1.0 Attack/1.0 ElementalAttack/1.0 HP scalings and 0ms ChantSpeed/0ms AttackInterval. So impressions from game balance and combat system can vary if You play it like devs wanted - with party of 4 characters and even more passive enemy AI.",1642189565,1642189964,False,6,0,0.452659785747528076,1,True,False,False

I am big fan of tales series but i have a mixed feelings toward this game, here's why :

Good :
- Graphic is stunning, one of the best aspects in game
- Battle system is so much fun.
- Voice acting is incredible
- The music is awesome

Bad :
- CP system is suck, why you need CP point for healing skill only?
- The town feels like just a decoration and the only house you can enter  is an Inn in every town. Also the town feels so lifeless, nothing much to interact with the NPC.
- The story is kinda meh and generic

I feel like there are a lot of better JRPG than Tales of Arise but if u are want to try this JRPG, why not?

-The story is wonderful, it has a vast chain line that makes you have a love/hate relationship with multiple characters. As each develop their own ideas and thoughts you begin to love each phrase and each back story is well written. 
-The art style is phenomenal. It has lush and beautiful worlds with each their own distinctive features. The foes are also very well designed and have a very nice clear cut beauty to them. 
-The combat system is both great and repetitive. I feel that the way the combos are were fantastic to see but over time they got annoying and I felt that there could have been a few newer combos set in as the game progressed to keep things fresh. The animation for cut scenes mid battle are also on a scaling system, persay. They are ""meh"" at first but by the end of the story have you up on your seat. 
Overall this game is a great game. And if you were a fan of the Xenoblade series or any other RPG for that matter, then I would definitely recommend this game to you. I have numerous hours logged in and I am still finding things to do in the world. I would rate this a solid 93/100!

I have listed my review as a ""Do Not Recommend"" because I honestly could not tell someone with enthusiasm to play this game. The game isnt BAD per se, but it is quite flawed in ways that matter to ME, and after having played the game past the point of no return (literally played the game too long to be able to get my money back) I find myself wanting about 88 hours of my life back, because I felt BURNED by the end of the game. That being said lets get into my review. 

**MILD TO HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD**

Pros:
The game is visually stunning compared to all previous Tales Games that came before it. You can tell a LOT of love went into the making of the environments and set pieces throughout Dahna (the world you spend 90% of your time on). While some may find this a bit boring, I LOVED how each region of Dahna had a clear and concise theme that USUALLY matched up with the element that was being harvested. (Cyslodia was a bit of a misdirect, as I thought Cyslodia would be water, but it ended up being Light.) 

Care was given to make sure characters were voiced by talent that actually made the character feel believable (there's a couple of obvious caveats to that, which I will touch on later and likely piss some people off too). I for the first time since I've heard him perform ENJOYED A BRYCE PAPENBROOK PERFORMANCE. No disrespect to the man himself, I just dont usually vibe with his voice, and I generally dont like how he makes certain characters sound, but his casting as Law was actually really good, and I really enjoyed listening to him speak and emote. However, for about 80% of the cast, the Japanese Dub just sounds better in most scenarios that aren't the main plot being explored, especially during combat. 

Speaking of Combat, combat is probably the best its been. It doesnt re-invent the wheel, but rather streamlines and polishes it to near perfection. It combined aspects of Xilla/Xilla 2 and Berseria's combat systems and gave us the best of both in my eyes. Every character felt adequately unique and novel, and yet, they werent needlessly complicated to play. Furthermore, the boost artes system adding an extra level of fun in how you used them either as combo extensions or responses to certain enemy types so you could shift the flow of combat in your favor. Just with Alphen alone, combat was infinitely interesting and fun to learn. I kinda wish that the game did a better job of getting players to experiment with other characters aside from Alphen rather than just letting people keep the training wheels on with him. Those tutorial sequences where the game attempts to give you a crash course on the gimmick of your new party member could instead be used as a scenario to make you PLAY as the new character and teach you basic combos and how the character feels when you're holding the reigns. But I digress.

Pacing felt adequate. Some tales games I've played sometimes felt like it dragged in places or rushed too much in others, but my issues with the story aside, objectively, this game was the best paced I've played in a while.

Cons:

This is a minor gripe, but its to build upon something I touched on earlier; I hated Ray Chase's performance and the person who voiced Kisara. Kisara sounded like some lady spent the last three years taking roids and was trying TOO hard to sound burly and tough. It was so unattractive and hard to listen to. I legitimately COULDNT listen to the game in English anymore once Kisara joined the party. My apologies to the actress in question, because I dont think its HER fault, but the voice direction for some characters was just...horrible. Kisara's VA probably would have been a perfect fit otherwise. 

On to Ray Chase. Ray Chase was acceptable in most non combat scenarios, but only as far as being generally boring. Again, while I hated his performance, I blame the voice director and the script/dialogue they gave to Alphen more than Ray.  He just sounds like a stereotypical ""I'm main character man. I'm the good guy."" Towards the end of the first arc, they TRY to do something interesting with Alphen's sickening characterization I will be henceforth dubbing ""Hero Syndrome"" but it just quickly turns into a pity party/main character is super depressed for kind of dumb reasons, and Ray Chase kinda fails to make that...work. In a situation where the writing of a character is super shakey, it really falls to the performer sometimes to fill in those gaps, but Ray dropped the ball too, so Alphen kinda just remains a mediocre main character man.

Now on to my biggest gripes with this game.

Story. The story sucks. I'm sorry, I know, you're probably already scrolling away or shaking your head like ""this guy is on drugs"" but hear me out: The story sucked because it was HIGHLY inconsistent, it did not do a good job of properly justifying some of its ""plot twists"" and in it's efforts to ""up the ante"" like most Tales games do after the first arc, it just causes the entire story to fall apart. The reveal of Alphen being the Sovereign could have been cool, and made for some interesting plot points if ""Mr. Dahnan liberator"" was a Renan himself, but nope, the whole title of Sovereign is made insignificant the moment its revealed because now apparently its something Renans could just manufacture and wasnt in any way the ruler of Rena. To further hammer this home, Volrhan is revealed to be Sovereign as well, but because he can cast astral arts and his eyes glow while doing so, you assume he's also Renan. (Find out later, he's Dahnan just like Alphen). You find out the Renas Alma is basically a highly misunderstood tool and it gets stolen by the red woman, a character, up until the point where she acts, literally does NOTHING. She just stands in the background when you're interacting with a Lord. 

Queue the sudden reveals about Astral Energy and how it cant be gathered in large quantities because it then gains sentience. Which also ends up being the true big bad all along. Sentient Dark Astral Energy. That took control of and puppeteers an ALIEN SPECIES INTO DOING ITS BIDDING. ITS BIDDING BEING ENSLAVING AN ENTIRE PLANET AND COMING UP WITH THE CROWN CONTEST TO HARVEST ALL OF DAHNA'S ASTRAL ENERGY. 

What? Really? This is the story? Also, keep in mind, after Act 1 ends, all the party members take backseats to Shionne and Alphen and their kinda shoehorned love story. Dolhalim has ONE pretty cool moment in Act 2. 

Level Progression was weird. The game expects you to grind a bit more than I like. There were several situations where I was fighting bosses that were 4 to 5 levels higher than I was, even though I did every side quest I could and some minor grinding beforehand. 

My final gripe was dialogue. Sometimes, the dialogue felt preachy and like it was speaking to a bunch of 12 year olds who didnt have an ounce of comprehension. The game LOVES to hear itself talk, and the characters spend too long saying the same things over and over again, just in slightly different ways. Whether in skits, during cut scenes, or during Alphen's stupid speech he gave Volhran during the final battle, (which deserves a rant on its own, but Im running out of space to type). The game constantly hammers you over the head with its themes and morals, which only works to the game's detriment and makes everything feel artificial. 

TL;DR:

Combat is fun. Game is fun if you basically ignore the story and dont give two craps about the character interactions too much. Otherwise, the story is absolute garbage, dialogue sucks, and this game will burn close to 100 hours of your life away and give you very little to show for it.",1642007878,1642007878,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I have to say, so far, this is a big leap forward for the series.  Here are the things that really stuck out to me:

One of the big weaknesses in other Tales games was the bland areas you would walk in between key points in the game.  Not the worst ever, but usually nothing special.  This game has such nice visuals that I actually don't hold the run button all the time, and actually completely stop to look at the scenery at some points.  Not only beautiful, but fits seamlessly into the world and narrative.  Great work here.

The other jumps forward are more subtle, such as key interaction points with the boss fight which was VERY well choreographed.

For those who haven't played a Tales game before, Arise retains one of the key features of the series:  A strong story. 
 Although in past games there is sometime a very wonky twist.. hopefully this story will continue to be compelling, and I'm looking forward to the rest.  But actually, even if I just stopped playing the game right now, I would be pretty satisfied.  Given the price tag I'm glad there is more.

A real AAA game so far.

 - Great character development and interaction (Iron mask, the main character's arc is more flat, less interesting than the other ones, mostly because he is the hero guy);
 - Fun, flashy battles;
 - Lots of difficulty modes so you can choose your cup of tea;
 - The game limits you resources well, which makes it being difficult possible;
 - Really lenghty, I have 73 hours on record (though some of that was in paused state) and, while close, I did not finish doing all subquests

Expanding on the difficulty and items bit:

I played it on moderate and died quite a lot. 
When I played ff15 I felt that items were too OP: you could get plentiful potions and spam them. FF7R fixes that by making you need to spend ATB to use items. 

Now this game fixes it by putting a small timer between item uses AND making items somewhat scarce: through much of the game I was low on money, and you can't hoard healing items as they are capped on 15 each. If you don't try to actually play well you can run low on resources pretty fast.

Somewhat on the same note, if you really are cheap and don't mind breaking immersion, you can make the game easier by going back to camps even in the middle of some dungeons. Also, when you wipe on non-boss battles, you kinda flee and heal up with magic (so you spend CP, which is a resource mainly used for healing magic), and of course without items used during the battle. So if you are cheap you can just save all the time and reload if you ever die, but if not, you can accept the loss and move on without pausing the game.",1641953538,1641953538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

-Ported wonderfully, runs very well. Easy to fiddle with the settings. 
-Story that has both elements of old retro classics and new narratives as well. Reminds me of both the old FF games with their hunt for crystals, while simultaneously having a super dark side.
-Very little crashes or bugs.
-Graphics are great and show that the Tales series have been given a real budget.
-Combat system is very solid, but not flawless.
-Every character is fun to play.
-Accessory crafting system is quite interesting in the second half of the game with transferrable skills.
-Suitably difficult, even on Normal.
-New take on skits, playing them in slides like a comic. 
-No TP, which was the resource used for both artes and healing in previous entries. This means that you can chain artes far easier and they're your main type of attack over just doing normal attacks. This is replaced with CP, which is exclusively used for healing. 

Cons:
-Can be too difficult, even on Normal.
-Not much of an overworld. Maps are also very linear.
-Only one character can block. Normally you alternate between dodging and blocking in different scenarios; here you cannot.
-Bosses and demibosses can never be staggered, no matter how many times you manage to hit them. Instead, the game wants you to down them using Boost Attacks. The inability to stagger using artes and normal attacks reduces the fun of the combo-heavy combat system during boss battles, as they become more akin to hit and run fights.
-A few instance of wonky hitboxes during battle.

Overall an excellent game, but go in expecting a challenge. This game won't be a complete cakewalk.

A great entry point for those who never played the Tales series before, Tales of Arise is a self contained story line. One of the best thing about Tales of Arise is the combat for sure, with being able to string together different moves you learn throughout the game as your own combo and the team system works great to adding more dynamic feeling to each battle. Mystic arts also add some great visual eye candy.

The cast is also very good, although each cast member retain popular anime tropes. This didn't bother me too much as they each have enough in their personality to be their own character and lovable in every right. The banters and conversations between every party member brings them to life, and you'll see each character develop not only as a party but also as individuals as they each deal with their own bias and demons. Tales of Arise also did what a lot of anime tend to avoid and actually having an adult cast which I absolutely love. Well, 4/6 including the dual protagonists are adults, where 2 party members are teenagers. Works beautifully, I wish more anime/ anime games feature adult casts instead of keeping them as teenagers.

The story is nothing really to write home about. It is pretty standard in terms of Anime/ Anime games story lines but it stays engaging enough to keep you invested through most of the game. The pacing is great up until towards the end of the game, where you'll be bombarded with cutscenes after cutscenes after skits after cinematic cutscenes. It become very overbearing with an insane amount of exposition that I wish was handled better because that stretch of the game just felt tedious to go through, even if I enjoyed the cast. Probably the biggest criticism I can offer the game.

The RPG mechanics shine mostly through the Arte system. If you have play a Tales game before, you'll be familiar with the system but basically the more you use a certain skill, the stronger it becomes and it can even unlock another skill for you if you use it enough. The skill tree/ set system is your standard number buff you expect to see in a lot of RPG games, nothing to exciting with the exception of the ones that let you unlock a new skill. You will be unlocking a lot of skill sets/ titles throughout the game so there is never any shortage of upgrades. Weapons and armors are your standard number buff, where you will find a small upgrade to your previous weapon and armor as you progress throughout your game. Armors offer no visual changes but weapons do. However, there is a fair amount of costumes/ alternatives in the game you can unlock via collecting owls or quests. There is also the paid-DLC costumes that you can buy. Speaking of DLC, Tales of Arise unfortunately suffers what many Japanese RPG games tend to do and that is selling you overpriced DLCs/ costumes. (Some of which contains unique skills)

Visually the game is a treat. While still retaining the anime art style you'll see in a lot of anime style games, the visual effects on abilities are a whole another level, with particles flying everywhere and color bursting every possible second. 

Overall, I highly recommend Tales of Arise to anyone who wants to jump into the Tales series or is just looking for a good action RPG. With the great combat, lovable casts, and just overall a great experience, it easily landed as one of my favorite single games that released in 2021.",1641884503,1641940314,True,25,0,0.740988373756408691,0,True,False,False

While the game have some good points, I'll not recommend it because there are many, many more JRPGs out there that's better than this one.

First, the things I like,
- Great atmospheres, world is beautiful and animation cut-scenes are well made.
- Songs. The songs in this game is damn good.

Now, the things I don't like/could be better
1.Story. I don't have problem with linear story since it's common in JRPG. The problem is that the story makes me feels like I'm riding a roller coaster. The setting is on a PLANET (or two) with several REALMS, yet the story is extremely rushed. You start in a village, you go the baddies place, beat the guy, now go to the next realm. In this next realm you go straight to the main city, invade the bad guy home, kick that man's ass. Repeat. With almost nothing in between.
This leads to some unreasonable event. Some of the characters you meet will change their personality or life choice like a flip switch after one or two events. Many characters also lack depths to make you feel like they are person.
Main story takes only 50 hrs to complete which is very short for RPG game. Hell I even did most of the side content.

2.Combat. Early on it is quite fun to beat things up in a fast pace combat. But as the game goes on it gets worse, much worse.
- Once you reach mid-game almost every enemy is a bullet (sword? punch? whatever) sponge that will take a lot of beating to take it down. Even the mage type.
- As a game that encourage player to make high combo, it certainly does not make it easy. Each character have loads of skills (Artes) to make combo, yet most of them is not really good at making a chain, especially aerial combo. Most of the time I have to stick with very few basic artes to make high combo. Star ocean series have a very similar style of combat and they did a better job.
- There are very few enemy types in the game, like 10 or so. Now, I don't have problems with monster recycle with different colors here and there. But the same enemy in EVERY area since the first area to the very end of the game is just plain lazy. Even half of the boss is just a bigger normal enemy, or recycle boss. You like dogs? Here's some red, green, blue, black dogs for you to kill. Oh, have some purple dogs as well.
- AI is not really smart, which make every boss/miniboss fight become item spam. Even when the boss charge its attack from a mile away, they will still make no effort to run out of the way. Late game boss fight is determine by how much CP (MP in other game) recovery items you have. Because it doesn't matter how good you are, your friends will still get lots of  beating and cry for healing. Not to mention that the last dungeon in this game is kind enough to place miniboss at every fucking doorway, to make sure you run out of supplies before the actual boss fight. 

In short, I'd say go try other JRPG. You'll most likely get a better game with cheaper price. Consider this game If it is on heavy discount or you already play lots of JRPG and craving for more.",1641917695,1641917837,False,7,1,0.538709700107574463,4,True,False,False

All characters follow the generic anime template, within the first minute I encounter anyone, their entire plotline, personality, actions throughout the whole game are immediately apparent. Drama throughout the story feels forced and half of the conversation is repeating the same thing over and over again, it seems they are trying really hard to sell emotions that I just wanna skip through the dialogs. 

The combat feels very chaotic, 3 AI controlled allies along with the enemy are casting flashy spells back to back, it takes some work identifying what you are casting, when you land a hit, there isn't a noticeable difference in the enemy health bar since most skills are not burst damage and there are 3 other teammates dealing damage at the same time, none of which gave a rewarding combat experience, eventually I just gave up and switched to very easy mode with auto combat.

I mean, last Tales I played was Berseria and that was probably the latest games until 2021. Excluding the spin off and mobile games of course. 

First of all is the story, the story of the game start of pretty strong where you exposed to the environment and the main plot of the game. Each characters are exposed and told very nicely and has their own development throughout the story. The band of characters are definitely of my favorite group in any Tales games. They are not forgettable and written very nicely. The game is actually split into 2 part. I called them The Beginning and The Ending. The start as I mentioned is strong and good but the second part almost makes me felt asleep. I don't want to spoil anything but the second parts feels like it got drag pretty long to the conclusion but it rewards you with a satisfying ending.

Furthermore, I think Bandai's peak of their newest game is the combat. Well, ToA's combat is indeed the best in the series for me. It's easy to mastered and you can actually melt the characters this time (as intended). Maxing you skill sets can actually deals you a lot of damage than ever before. Plus, since this game is using a new engine, it's smooth and will ease your gameplay. Similar to Scarlet Nexus, Bandai has improve a lot in terms of gameplay making in more enjoyable.

Soundtracks are kinda good. It's not my favourite but definitely heals you ears. Each places has it's own vibe and themes.

In conclusion, Tales of Arise is one of the games that you should play whether you're a returning player or new. The series has existed for a long time and is one my best JRPG until today. I give this game an 8/10.",1641902940,1641902940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics aren't as sharp as they could be in 2021 to be honest. There are so many games visually more appealing. However, I found the designs of bosses in Tales of Arise excellent, even though there was still room for improvement on their mechanics.

The combat is extremely smooth. Given that you can play as any of the six characters, you can choose to play whichever class you want, and then switch characters even in the middle of a fight. This kept the fights engaging over the 50 hours of gameplay. Some of the instructions (like the ones to execute combo moves) aren't well explained though, so I did Google a bit of stuff.

The bad:

The combat is pretty shallow despite an honest attempt at depth.  It's an active combat system, but it's just mashing through whatever your optimal string of normals and specials will keep your target stun locked longest, then hit them with an ally's attack so you can loop that again.

The writing is bad and tropey.  Character conflicts feel shallow.  Points that should generate conflict and deserve discussion are brushed aside.  Optional side conversations are a mix of throwaway backstory dives and overexplaination of lore - think diving into midichlorians and how the force works.

Walking around the world is clunky.  There's an awkward positioning/lineup animation that plays when a character approaches a ladder or enters water.

The good:

The game runs great from a performance perspective.  It's very pretty.  Most of the cast are great voice actors.  The music is very well done - if you're sensitive to bad music with empty melodies and cadences that never resolve you'll find this inoffensive to pleasant.

In summary:

I feel like I'm forcing myself to play it out of love for Symphonia and Abyss.  The game is painfully linear and offers little to no reward for straying from the main path.

This game took longer time than I thought. I've spent around 70+ hours finishing the story. (include farming the exp) The boss fight is fun. Not easy but, not hard. However, this game requires you to grind and farming. Map design is very great, makes me want to explore. There are many things to collect!
Besides attacking monsters, you can go fishing too. 
The end-game is still very good to play. There are many things for you to do.

Advantages:
- Easy to understand game fighting logic / how to play.
- Beautiful graphics and map designs
- Cool and awesome characters designs. All character have their characteristic.
- Exciting and captivating game story
- Cool game theme (Like Medieval + Sci-fi)
- Nice voice acting.
- Various gameplay styles (Ex. Like choose the character to main)

Disadvantages:
- Somehow, the in-game dialog seems too long and can make you boring
- Maybe, too many cut-scenes
- Sometimes, there are too many mid-boss and can make you boring again.

Nevertheless, I wanted to say that I really love this game and this game is freaking awesome.
Again, worth playing. If you are looking for JRPG games and want a good story and gameplay, don't hesitate to buy this game!! Sincerely, thank you!!!",1640374824,1641830182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And it’s true that the game is fantastic, the main highlight for me is the combat system, it never gets boring. And each character plays really differently, so once you get bored with a character, you can just try another character out (However, Alphen + Shionne is just so incredibly overpowered that the choices you have for your squad composition is limited). The game is incredibly well optimized, runs butter smooth and I’ve had little to no issues running it on my PC. There’s also a ton of content, aside from the main story and side quests, there’s also things like fishing and combat training that rewards your time and effort incredibly well, to complete everything I’d say it’d take around 70 hours, and that’s not including the option of playing new game+, if you’re up for it. 

So, TLDR, Tales of Arise is fantastic, go get it if you’re into JRPGs, even at full price it’s worth it imo.

What I really want to talk about in this review is the game’s negatives that people don’t really talk about that much, because Tales of Arise is definitely not a perfect game, and I have of reasons as to why it isn’t so.

First off, the cast, for JRPG standards, they’re not that memorable. The biggest offender for me is the MC, Alphen, who is your typical goody-two-shoes, heart of gold protagonist, and [spoiler] Vholran, one of the main antagonists of the game, who’s your generic “I am evil. The strong shall rule the weak, blah blah blah” type of villain [/spoiler]. There’s just nothing that Alphen adds to the table when it comes to Anime or JPRG protagonists, he’s just so uninteresting, and there is nothing about [spoiler]  Vholran that justifies his actions and the way he acts or anything at all that lets the players sympathize with him [/spoiler]. The rest of the cast doesn’t have that good of a chemistry either, and the moments peppered throughout the story don’t really solidify the bonds that they share, by the end you never really feel like they’re actually a group of close friends, but more like a group of strangers who eventually got somewhat close while travelling together.

Secondly is the plot, things are going to get spoilery here, so if you haven’t played the game yet, you can just skip this part of my review; [spoiler] Tales of Arise’s story, in my opinion, is unnecessarily complicated; when it didn’t need to be. The story could’ve been a simple Dahnans vs Renans story starting with the rebellion, eventually the second half could lead to the reveal that the Renans of Lenegis were being controlled by a secret society (The Renans of Rena). To me this is a fairly simple plot, that’s easy to understand and get into, but also adds depth and intrigue as you get deeper and deeper into the story while avoiding confusion. But no, they just had to add aliens and mind control into the mix. Tales of Arise’s story reminded me of the plot of Darling in the Franxx, which got considerable backlash since it unnecessarily added another antagonist to the show as it is about to end. A manga version of Darling in the Franxx got released that showed a more simplified plot compared to the anime, which was kind of like the Tales of Arise plot that I suggested, and the reception to it was generally positive. So there’s concrete proof that a more complicated plot doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better. There’s no payoff at the very end either, all that time spent building up the romance between Alphen and Shionne, and all we get is a slideshow of them getting married on the end credits. [/spoiler]

In typical JRPG fashion, armor sets don’t actually change how your character looks, but costumes do, and for some of these costumes, you can get them by just playing the game and progressing through the campaign. But for a lot of them, you can only buy them through in game purchases as DLCs. They’re also PRELOADED into the game, so even if you’re not planning on buying them, you have to download them along with the base game. Let me tell you right now that they are NOT worth it, none of the DLCs are, you get plenty of bang for your buck by purchasing the base game already, so save your money and don’t get tempted by the DLCs. If there’s one thing I absolutely hate about JRPGs, it’s this armor and costume system and the fact that this is an industry standard that refuses to adopt the transmog system that lots of western RPGs use.

The game also recycles a lot of character models, mostly for NPCs and the main enemy type of this game, zeugles. The fact that you’re going to see the same set of generic faces throughout the entirety of the game is just so immersion breaking to me, because only the very very important characters gets the treatment and privilege of getting their own unique character model. So if you see any character with one of these recycled models, you’ll immediately know that they are irrelevant to the plot. The same thing goes for the zeugles, so after a while, the excitement you get of encountering new types of enemies when you get into a new area completely dies off because you know that you’re just going to fight the same types of enemies, just with different colors.

Lastly, I want to talk about the quality of the cutscenes, since the animations are lacking in quality, sometimes they're not even there at all. Because while it is understandable that since the game has so many dialogue it has to make some compromises, it's just hilarious to see an emotional cutscene, complete with heartwarming dialogue, gentle music and a gorgeous background, only to have that moment ruined because Rinwell is doing this generic T Pose throughout the entire thing. 

Putting those negatives aside, let me reiterate that Tales of Arise is a fantastic game, which justifies a lot of people claiming that it is the best tales game. If I were to score this game on a scale of 1 – 10, the negatives would probably only scratch about a 1 out of it’s 10/10 score, which makes my score for this game a 9/10. Even if you don’t like JRPGs, I’d whole-heartedly recommend that you try Tales of Arise out.",1641788371,1641788972,True,3,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

No animation cancels and bosses with super active hitboxes and some mixed telegraphs leave combat feeling ok..? at best and miserable at it's worst.

Any aoe will hit them 100% of the time no matter how obvious or easy it is to dodge, but if there's any attack that targets them specifically then they become Neo from the matrix.

Story and premise start out decent and the writing is pretty typical of your average jrpg, but quickly becomes absolute dog shit. I dropped it due to how insultingly bad the writing was during the 4th lords arc and I will not be returning. It might be the worst writing I have ever seen in a video game. Maybe if the gameplay was solid enough I'd stick around, but it feels like more of a chore after 20 or so hours.

To be honest, most have been good, and some have been not so good... at all even.  However, I tread on knowing there's got to be one saving grace somewhere within all the games in the Tales of series to have kept me a fan for so many years.  I know that in this day and age, the graphics would be exemplary and yes, they are.  The soundtrack, is ""meh"" - many others have had much better to the point that  I'd enjoy the OST even when I wasn't actively playing.  All in all though, for the 21st century the upgrades are nice and enjoyable.  A good game isn't only graphics though, I know this, it's just icing on the cake.  This cake has great icing!

The story is predictable unfortunately.  The characters were a little bland too, although if I had to choose which I liked best, I like Alphen.  Great all around good guy.  Shionne is definitely no Velvet from Berseria whom I adored her attitude and solid composure.  I think they wanted to make Shionne in Velvet's footsteps by giving her a touch of the sarcasm which what in Berseria was great as you really felt it. Shionne tries, but fallsl way short.  Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she doesn't quite have the ""oomph"" in her words and attitude.  The voice actress had a lot to live up to and I'm sure she did her best, but it was bland in my opinion.

I'm about halfway through, and it's more a labor of love to say I finished it.  I do however love the battle mechanics though.  I opted to switch up characters and they are very involved if you choose to play that way.  If you want to play the whole thing as the protagonist Alphen you can, by all means, but the control of melding the different characters and using their strengths for different enemies and bosses makes the game more complex, but it a good way.  It's as simple or involved as you wish to make it.  So all levels of players can fit anyway, be it new player or experienced.  This game is also a great setup for a play through again to try a new strategy and a harder level too.  It makes it easy to skip the story elements so don't let that stop you from a replay as some older Tales games, you want to play again for the battle, but dread going through the story again.  The battle system is so nice and customizable you'll have a good time playing through again.

Before Berseria, Tales of Symphonia (yes old Gamecube one too lol) was my favorite.  Tales of Berseria captured me in many ways, and using Velvet as their first female protagonist was a great choice as she fit her role perfectly, especially being the first.  I still think they were trying to get Shionne to follow in her footsteps somewhat, but it's a fail.  Alphen does a good job, but as I said earlier, the story is a little dry and predictable.  I'm glad Alphen is doing well so far albeit it following a story that's been done for ages in every RPG ever made.  That's not his fault.

If you're an JRPG or RPG fan, give it a try.  If you're into graphics, give it a try.  If you want a predictable story, give it a try.  If you want to experience harder playing levels, give it a try.  A lot of haters say it's overrated, but it's not - it's a little lacking in story, but is a definite game to put on your play list if you like the genre!  It may not of been a ""happy happy joy joy"" review I typed out, but in all actuality, it's more good than bad and I'd give it a solid 7.5 out of 10.  If you like good fun battles and a touch of modern solid graphics, you'll get some enjoyment out of it.  What's funny is that as I write this, I'm listening to the Tales of  Zestiria OST lol :)

Hope you give it a try, and if unsure, wait for a sale.  It's good :)  (I've been watching cel-shading graphics morph from Jet Grind Radio on the Dreamcast and Wind Waker on Gamecube, to this, and these are amazing!)

Almost forgot:  I wish they'd of used a real owl sound instead of some 80 year old saying hoot hoot.  You'll see. LoL :)

Tales of Arise is tighter in both narrative and gameplay. The change from an overland map to interconnected maps I think is one of the best pacing improvements. It keeps the gameplay tight and I found myself always moving through fighting, exploration, and story in a fairly solid loop. 

The cutscenes are great, offering a mix of serious, plot related scenes, to daily life of a group of traveling fighters, to the complex relationship dynamics that emerge between the different characters. 

Fights are punchier, streamlined, and really cool, especially the finishing moves. 

In terms of pacing, the game does such a good job of slowly layering in more stuff as you play, adding more characters and more gameplay aspects. I really appreciate this style of scaffolding gameplay and allowing players to really master and play around with various techniques and character before we get something new. 

This pacing also applies to the world, and plot, which is a cool experience. I'm always surprised at how much more complex, real, and alive the world feels as I travel to each new region. 

If you're looking for a great game with a solid narrative, a great sense of discovery, AND both of that offered in a punchy and streamlined semi-open world, then you will seriously have fun with this game.

(spoiler free!)

Pros: 

1. Combat is a lot better and the AI doesn't immediately die like before. 
2. You don't have to spend hours grinding to continue to the next plotpoint like in Xillia 2/Zestiria/Berseria. 
3. Environments are a lot more unique in Arise and the dungeons aren't copy and pasted. 
4. The story has room for improvement but is still very enjoyable. 
5. The updated skit system retains whatever outfits are equipped on the characters unlike before and it's neat. There's also a larger variety of outfit types and a lot more colors, which I liked. 
6. Both types of ships. 
7. Best Girl Shionne.

Cons: 

1. Very limited strategies for combat. While the AI has been improved, they will still die to really dumb attack patterns. Because of this, some enemies and bosses could technically be easily defeated at a much lower level, but the AI doesn't make this feasible enough to waste time trying. 
2. The story is rather ""simple"" and whenever it encounters something with complexity it either dumbs it down it or doesn't attempt to explain it at all. There are multiple points in the plot where the logistics of how things worked out doesn't make sense. I think the main theme was handled in a too positive light considering it's about slavery, freedom, and the abuse of power and authority. 
3. Final battle was as easy as the first boss fight. 
4. Alphen ""has the strength"" to offer forgiveness but not the common sense of who to give it to. 
5. No turtlz.

Controls are intuitive and combat as smooth as glass. You can freely switch characters during battle to manually take over attacking, healing or tanking as needed if the AI isn't getting the job done. There are numerous ways to customize your arte sets with the plethora of attacks at your disposal. The game also introduces special boost attacks that can be triggered when each character's gauge fills up. A couple of these in particular are critical at later stages in the game (some situations even require them). Note that Arise is more challenging than previous Tales games, requiring better strategy and light to moderate grinding to keep your party at a similar level to the enemies you face. Level difference has a significant impact vs previous titles; even a gap of just 3 levels can be quite noticeable. 

There are a handful of weapons which are upgradable to more advanced versions via crafting. You can also craft some weapons outright as you unlock new tiers of gear through story progression. Armor can be purchased, but not modified. Accessories are deeply customizable with up to 5 attributes apiece via crafting and infusion. The latter is vital to controlling battlefield aggro, reducing casting times, boosting attack efficiency and more.

Open world environments let you fight baddies to your heart's content. Leaving an area and returning will respawn all basic enemies. Additionally, consumables and items found in the field (not chests) respawn with time.

Arise has wonderful visuals, despite relying on motion blur to blend frames during cutscenes, combat and exploration. As one who is sensitive to motion blur, however, it should not be noticeable unless taking screenshots while characters are in motion.

Music is excellent and sound effects are quite good. As a bonus, there's solid English voice acting, which can be uncommon among JRPGs.

The gameplay is fun and challenging. It's fun to play and easy to understand. Casting/performing your artes hasn't felt this good in awhile. If the ""gaming"" part of the JRPG experience is your thing, I absolutely recommend. 

However, I don't really think I like this game as much as I thought I would. I think there is a serious issue in terms of character chemistry and story. Very vanilla characters that have very little chemistry or have interactions that directly break immersion by contradicting how they interact in cutscenes. I like the characters in isolation but not together. 

The story is pretty bland. Not much thought put into the villains and story and it's honestly pretty brainless even by Tales standards. I was expecting much more. 

Graphics are beautiful, no doubt, and the soundtrack is impressive.

As a Tales fan, I don't want to recommend it. But it's definitely still a good game. But, don't feel bad if you don't like this game. It's definitely not for every Tales fan.

Lip syncing is completely off and the story and dramatics have been tuned to a Japanese audience. Every character in the game is an emotional wreck and every little feeling gets thoroughly talked about. There's tons of voice acting, videos and action comic book style skits that you get to watch.  At times it feels overwhelming with the emotional roller coaster you are forced to endure, one moment a character is having a happy feeling and on the next video - he/she is an emotional train wreck. However, there are hidden gems that are well placed and is treat to experience when playing the game. 

Combat is a lot of fun, especially when you get good enough to sequence multiple chain events in a single battle. It's fast paced fighting and when grinding you can move from battle to battle with very little wasted time between battles. Exp and loot are calculated on a side window at the end of every fight - loot automatically makes it way into your inventory. Also at the end of multiple battles you end up resting at a campsite to recover HPs and buy/sell whatever you found.

Tales of Arise is a fun game and if you factor in that there's going to be a lot of cheesy JRPG videos to watch with the possibility of a good story buried somewhere deep.

Screenshots they show at store page are very deceiving, the game hardly has better visuals than its 6-7 years old predecessors. Yeah, you won't be playing this game for graphics, but advertising it like that is awfully wrong.

Combat
Combat is my main source of disappointment. Berseria, in my opinion, has best combat of all Tales I've played. Zestiria was more repetitive and not as varied, but still relatively fun to engage. Now Arise is like dark souls... except worse. Attacks are short and repetitive, combo making is hard and impractical: your most valid option for avoiding damage is dodging which can't be activated until the attack animation is over. 

Levelling system
Level imbalance is insane, the game forces you to either play with the lowest difficulty possible or mindlessly grind levels through the same routine just to finally be able to proceed forward at some point. The moment you reach your very first boss, it will likely have double your level. Which means oneshot, each attack, every time. I had similar problem in Zestiria, had to grind levels a lot to slowly progress through the game, but dying to a single hit was never an issue. Now it is.

Story and MC
Not a fan of the story so far, looking at MC, you would expect Eizen kind of personality, but nah, he's more like Sorey on steroids.
The whole setting is rather silly, but these are nothing more than my initial impressions as I haven't progressed much through the game yet.

In short: this is literally same game it was in previous iterations, even worse in some places, I don't see the reason behind AAA pricing and overall hype. Just keep that in mind - you get it if you want another Tale, not a 2021 game, because it ain't one.",1641503016,1641503417,False,4,4,0.4618988037109375,2,True,False,False

Too many games these days try too hard to stick out in some way and consequently feel lacking. I loved this game because of how rounded out it felt, so here are some thoughts:

- Story is average, passable. 
- Combat is solid, but can have it's quirks.
- There is a lot to do in side quests.
- Characters don't feel rigid and have what feels like natural conversations with one another. Unlike some other games... (I'm looking at you Scarlet Nexus!).
- Graphics are well executed and strike quite a good balance with quality vs. density.

My only gripes are: 
- That I wish there were more cosmetics and diversity in weapons (a lot of the weapons are just recolors or their weaker counterparts).
- Post game feels to fall short.

Once I thought the game was over, it was not, and there was always another and longer boss fight (Not Sure if this is normal for this type of game play). Also I thought that they over did it in the side cut dialog with the characters. Like I said, it was good to build the relationships between them but it was side cut dialog after side cut dialog. It was your options to play the side dialog, but if I didn't, I felt like I was missing out on a big part of the game.  

Friendly advice, make sure you have lots of healing and supplies as you will need it at the end and for the final three boss fights. The game doesn't give you enough supplies towards the end.

Before getting the game I had heard that it was good and the first few cutscenes had some cool choreography. I think those are the only 2 reasons which made me keep playing for over 20 hours. 
I might try to rush through the rest of the game on an easier difficulty later just out of curiosity. If I do, I'll try to update this review.

- Combat is meh.
   - Normal enemies quickly became too easy. I think the game itself hinted at this by saying very early that you should avoid fights whenever possible.
   - While boss enemies either take ages to kill, or take ages to kill while being a crazy difficulty spike from the regular enemies. And no, I'm not talking about the lvl40 something in the starting area, that was kind of neat.
- Maps are kinda small.
- Story (so far) has been meh.
- Characters range from bad to mediocre.
- Some mechanics comments:
   - The ranch mechanic was just a meat store with extra steps.
   - The multiplier from clearing combats in quick succession was actually detrimental, as I felt pressured to rush through zones and missed some dialogue when I entered combat just as someone started talking about something.
- There are some audio quality issues. Especially in the English voice audio.
- Loading times are oddly long while being very frequent.
- The entirety of the 3rd city is a lag fest. Somehow even during cutscenes.",1641320940,1641320940,False,1,0,0.410364329814910889,5,True,False,False

PROS:
--combat* 
--environment, art, character design
--overall graphics (kind of)

*WHEN THE PARTY IS NOT FIGHTING A BOSS

CONS
--egregious npc and texture pop-in (I am using a very old GPU though, your mileage may vary, thanks crypto miners)

--music can be pleasant at times, but can mostly be described as generically orchestral.

--the flaws within the combat system really show when fighting bosses, and the CP system leaves a lot to be desired

--highly obnoxious difficulty spikes though the story, even when playing on Normal difficulty

--dialogue is reprehensibly stilted, even by JRPG standards

--writing is sub par, (again) even by JRPG standards

--voice acting is very hit or miss, with certain characters almost compelling you to either change to Japanese audio or to jam toothpicks in either ear 

--scummy microtransactions and day-1 DLC, with skills and arts locked exclusively behind said DLC",1631226752,1641311203,False,13,7,0.345254182815551758,4,True,False,False

Honestly it's a fine Tales of game. It's a classic hero tale... which is fine. Berseria is more memorable for me though because it did something different and it was able to pull it off. Combat's fun but there are a lot of irksome moments personally(there's a fetish for charging enemies in this game for some reason), characters' personality are fine, script for the dialogue is a bit off for me though(maybe because the characters are too goody-goody?), and story's fine(spoilers below).

The last time I had this itch, I played Scarlet Nexus and had a blast. Now I'm onto Tales of Arise, and I definitely am definitely getting the scratch with this.

Gameplay: It's a standard RPG - overworld where you traverse the landscape with your character and can run into enemies. Running into an enemy will automatically drop you into a smaller battle arena - while controls are simplistic, it still does have a lot of an arena-fight feel to it. In terms of combat, Scarlet Nexus handily surpasses Tales of Arise. However, despite the less-than-excellent gameplay in comparison to SN, the game is still introducing new mechanics or skills that are easy to pick up and helps keep it varied.

Graphics/Sound - Graphics, while looking a little off in some areas, is still very good overall. The translation of an anime style to cell-shaded graphics (or a form of it I figure) works out very well. Voice acting is pretty good with some recognizable dub voice actors/actresses. There is also a good amount of actual animated sequences done by ufotable (very very highly regarded anime studio).

Story - I'm digging it. It is your VERY typical JRPG fare. Something about ""energy"" or ""astral artes"" or some other conceptual thing that you'd only find in an anime. However, the characters do have a good amount of synergy and there is quite a bit of in-between dialogue during the game as you watch the characters grow. I'm normally one that would skip a bunch of story cutscenes, but I'm drawn into every turn of this story. I'm invested, yo.

Value-wise, I'd only recommend buying it at the full $60 if you're really into anime games or RPGs. You'll get your money's worth. If you're like me though, I'd recommend picking it up for a $40-and-under sale. You won't be disapointed.",1641268169,1641268169,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

740130,107186407,76561198004282144,0,54,6158,0,3500,1642314207,"TLDR: A great game for newcomers to ""Tales of"" games, but probably just a ""good"" entry for Tales Veterans.

Tales of Arise excels in some ways and is severely lacking in a few others. While I absolutely recommend it, long time ""Tales of"" fans will likely have a few reservations and might want to wait for a sale. I waited for a 40% off sale, and I don't regret it.

Where ToA excels is in combat and visuals. Some Tales games have very convoluted combat systems, that even Tales fans disliked/struggled with, but ToA's fighting system is simple enough that anyone can learn it, and deep enough that there is genuine challenge in racking up combos, triggering Boost Strikes, and Mystic Artes. This game also requires less grinding then many of the past games (I played on Moderate difficulty). However, one huge flaw is in the Strategy system. Since Tales games are Action RPGs, your party members are all fighting in real time, so previous games have always had settings to tweak the AI behavior of your teammates. In ToA, the Strategy options are all crammed into one menu, for your entire party, with very limited settings. Keeping your party members alive, while also maximizing their damage in combat, is very frustrating. Previous games allowed you to set different strategies for each character, so you could set your magic users to stay far away from enemies, and have your melee fighters stay up close. This degree of control is not available in ToA; consequently, your AI teammates will either die a lot, requiring you to use items, or contribute to damaging enemies much less to survive longer.

Visually, the game is more beautiful than any Tales game that have preceded it, and it matches recent AAA titles. The environments are detailed and picturesque. This is true during combat as well when magic powers are flashing all over the screen and your characters are jumping, slicing, and dashing all over the place, it's very cool to watch. Furthermore, ToA is optimized very well. I have a moderately fast PC and I have the graphic settings maxed, and I never dipped below 60fps while playing. The only negatives for the visuals is how empty and small all of the towns/cities are. Something like only five people live in each town, and they also don't do much of anything. The majority of NPC's just stand there. Except for the small number of NPC's, the lack of movement/action is actually pretty common in Tales games; however, with games like Witcher 3 and RDR 2 creating such vibrant and living settings, I think the Tales series needs to update for the times, and could match at least HALF of what those games accomplish!

All that said, I must address the WORST part of ToA: the story, characters, and skits. This might be a ""hot take"" but the story and characters are significantly worse compared to past games, such as Berseria, Vesperia, Abyss, Graces, Symphonia, and Phantasia (I've been a long-time player). The premise for the game is pretty good: one planet has conquered and enslaved another planet for 300 years, but beyond that the characters are all really generic. If you are at all familiar with anime, the main female lead, Shionne, is your basic ""Tsundere,"" so if you have seen any anime EVER, you know how her story is going to go with the main male lead character. The main male lead character is basically Goku from DBZ (personality wise). None of the characters are very interesting or unique, and their English voice actors are AWFUL! This isn't as big of a deal for me, as I just put on the Japanese audio, with subtitles, but if you're not willing to do that, then you are going to suffer through some of the most wooden, flat voice acting you've ever seen in a game. During combat characters perform these special paired-attacks called ""Boost Strikes"" and they yell catchphrases during their attacks. All of the English voice actors say their attacks like they were sitting in coffee shop, trying to keep their voices down. They are supposed to be FIGHTING! The Japanese voice actors are clearly yelling and putting intense emotions into their combat dialogue. 

Finally, we come to the Skits. Tales games are known for short dialogue scenes that play while you are exploring the game world, and they serve to deepen the backstories and personalities of the characters, as well as add complexity to the story. The skits in ToA are all very generic, and are mostly really shallow discussions about losing loved ones, racism, oppression, and slavery. The skits that do actually address the backstory of the characters are annoyingly repetitive! There are very few genuine character building or funny moments. I can easily remember many conversations from Tales of Berseria that were hilarious! Such as when the two adult male characters in that game teased the young adolescent boy character about how to tell if a girl likes a guy (romantically), but they were clearly exaggerating to embarrass/confuse him. Then later, there's a ""part 2"" of the conversation, where the two adult female characters try to undo the false information the boy received, but then end up just making it worse, and embarrassing him more! For Tales fans, these are essential parts of the game, that endear the characters to us, so I am genuinely angered when I have to listen to a character talk about a dead family member who was perfect and kind, and how they don't know how to handle all of the hate and resentment over their death for the TENTH time! If you are a newcomer to the series, these scenes will probably just be confusing, or maybe frustrating, but thankfully you can skip through them.

All in all, it's a good game, that's worth playing, but I don't think it's better than any of my favorite Tales games personally.

เล่นจบในเวลาประมาณ 70 ชั่วโมงแบบเก็บ Achievement ครบหมด ถ้าไม่เก็บคิดว่า 40 ชั่วโมงก็จบได้

ข้อดี

- เกมทำออกมาค่อนข้างดี ภาพ เพลง เนื้อเรื่อง วิธีการสู้ โอเคหมด
- เล่นไม่นานมาก ไม่ยืดเยื้อจนเกินไป กำลังดี
- เกมออกแบบมาเป็นเกมสมัยใหม่ เซฟได้ทุกที เล่นได้แบบกระชับฉับไวไม่หัวร้อนไม่เสียเวลาฟาร์มมาก

ข้อเสีย

- ราคาแพงหน่อย
- ทำสมดุลช่วงท้ายเกมไม่ค่อยดี ต้นเกมนี่รู้สึกท้าทายในการสู้บอสแต่ละตัว ท้ายเกมนี่เฉยๆ มาก
- ศัตรูไม่หลากหลาย สู้ภาคก่อนๆ ไม่ได้
- รีวิว Overrated เกินไป อาจทำให้ตั้งความหวังสูงเกินเกมไปได้

The TL:DR is - the game is paper thin substance and one of the worst Tales games easily. That said for me the series has been slipping into this hack/slash mediocrity since Xillia 2. Wouldn't even recommend it if it was free cause you'd still be spending time on it. 

   Graphics - UE engine... pretty ... vibrant ... does not excuse the rest of this nonsense sorry. 

   Story - Main characters are about as one dimensional as they come even the supporting cast overs very little to the depth of the story aside being the almost mandatory extra character slots. The over all story has next to NO pacing and in the last couple hours of the game it basically is a snooze fest of exposition. 

   Combat - is like KH series and DS series combined which in theory sounds alright but falls on it's face right out of the gate being more button mashing then anything else ( I've never really cared for combat in any tales game that said because the combat has never been the selling point of these games and never should be... seriously it could be turn based for all I care )  

   Skits - are in this obnoxious art style that had me skipping them and with the inclusion of the quest markers and hand holding in these games since the days of Xillia 1-2 there isn't a reason to even watch them for information purposes. I will always hate the addition of markers in these kinds of games ( Yes I know you can turn them off that's not the point )

  Exploration and Side events - are pretty much non-existent once again the game uses the term RPG loosely and a personally I prefer the over world to the sectioned off areas ( This even extends to my thoughts on FF14 vs WoW so it's not just this series )

  Puzzles - are none existent as well removing another chunk of what makes an RPG good and have some alternative game-play depth I'm not saying the ones in past games have been hard but they are welcome additions to it ( it feels like they just released a shell of a game here, even the Xbox 360 ToV with lots of cut content was more fleshed out than this game  over all )

  Remember this moments  - are the worst dropped ball and none worse than the ending area and if you've made it there you probably know what I am talking about. WHY name areas after other games and have those kinds of references if you're not going to do anything with them ( Sorry but Edna and what's his face cameos aren't gonna cut it here, though the addition of Cronos from Xillia could've led to a much more compelling end game story )",1639007054,1641164717,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat system - I like how they have unique combat mechanic for individual character (Maybe not as unique as DMC 5 but its still cool). The skill effects and combos look badass but I have to say that the gameplay design is still pretty bold, The enemy's move is pretty plain and boring so most of the time it's just you spamming any button for minutes to kill the enemy.

Graphics - If I can only choose one best thing from this game it's definitely this one, The art direction and visual for this game is hilarious! It feels like you are exploring an art piece and almost every screenshot from this game can make a good desktop wallpaper.

Story - Well, about this one I have to say the overall is pretty cliche. It's a concept about slavery, rebellion and friendship. It feels like the plot came from 80s anime so I'm not surprise why a lot of people don't really like it (luckily I'm personally ok with it). The character design is pretty well-made, each character have their own personality and backstory and at least they made it deep enough for me to feels connected with the character. You will see each character's development along the journey and see how they grows their relationship between each other.

Exploration / Free roam - For me, This is the most disappointing thing in this game. They try to make it looks like an open world game but the truth is it's pretty much a linear game. There is a crafting system but I didn't feels like I can craft a weapon from farming monsters. The material you need for the weapon can only get when you reach a certain point of a story and there is no alternate choice for a different play style. The armor can only get from a chest along the way of your main story playthrough and there is no way for you to get it from exploring since most of the areas will be locked untill the story let you go there.

I know I complaint a lot up there but It's not as bad as it sounds, It's been a very big while since we have some decent JRPG and I have to say this one this game is the one I ACTUALLY enjoy playing it since the last few years. For me just having a beautiful world designs, quality combat gameplay and lovable characters is already far more than enough : )

So far i've played 7 hours which isn't much, but if i don't get hooked up to the game in 7 hours clearly it isn't for me.
So i'll give my 2 cents what i think about it.
game started of ok, good explanation of story line and a rough idea what's happening.
After a bit of playing i realized that maps of this game is narrow line where you just go from point a to point b killing few monsters and picking up few ingredients for your cooking on the way to point b. 
no exploring no searching no anything just go from point a to point b.
no crafting system of any kind. no loot drops from enemies of any kind. 
Story line although is ok, i just don't feel interacted with it and there's is no decision making in it, but rather just watch a cut scenes.
Another thing so i explained that there is no loot system, another thing is the only items you can put on on each character is a weapon, armor and 1 accessory. why couldn't armor be split in individual bits like helmet, body armor, boot, gloves etc?, but worst of all is even if you change armor the look of it on character doesn't change. to change the look you have to use like a wardrobe skin sort of thing (which is also part of DLC's).
I'll give it a plus for combat system which felt nice and my actions within it actually had consequences, i had to time my move and skills etc.
To sum my opinion up, game had a potential, but developers rushed it incomplete with things seem to be missing within the game... Games from 10-15 years ago like star ocean etc seem to be more interactive and involving.

Negatives:
* Story is a bit boring.
* Side quests no voice overs only characters huffing and puffing every time subtitles change
* map is linear with no exploration go from point a to point b
* no loot system
* items (except weapon) does not change appearance of your character.

positives:
* combat system
* no performance issues
* pretty characters.

This game's story is really awesome to be straightforward with you. Also, the combat system is great with a ton of flexibility in style and difficulty, plus it's insanely well animated.

I've been waiting for Tales of Arise for a long time, I bought it on launch and I finally finished it. 
I thought to myself ""Surely this can't beat the masterpiece that was Tales of Berseria, right?"".
Oh, how Bandai managed to surprise me and go well beyond my high expectations.

[h1] Story [/h1]
There are two planets, Dahna and Rena. Rena was always considered to be the land of the righteous and divine, even if the truth became distorted across generations of the people of Dahna. 300 years before the events of the game, Rena invaded Dahna and enslaved it, pillaging the planet of its astral energy and the people of its freedom. After that, the planet was divided and thus the Five Lords appeared, acting as representatives of Rena and competing in the Crown Contest to become the Sovereign who would rule over Renans.
You start the game as a slave, known as the ""Iron Mask"" because of the mask he finds himself wearing for a reason he does not remember... yet. Iron Mask is tired of living as a slave, so he decides to rebel and fight back against the Renans. Ironically, his first ally is Shionne, a [b] Renan [/b] prisoner with the peculiar trait of having thorns around her which prevent anyone from touching her without feeling extreme pain. 
Curious enough, Iron Mask also suffers from not feeling pain, see where I'm coming from?
The two decide to party up along with Zephyr, the leader of the Dahnan rebellion ""Crimson Crows"".

[h1] Party [/h1]
In terms of party, I do not think Arise surpasses Berseria. That is not to say the party is bad (quite the contrary, in fact).
Here is a brief summary of each party member aside from Iron Mask and Shionne which I've already talked about before:

- Rinwell: the only survivor of Dahnan magicians, she grows to hate Renans and swears to get revenge for her people's death, including her parents.
- Law: a misguided young boy, he starts off at the wrong side of history but will soon learn the error of his ways and swears to make up for his mistakes by joining Iron Mask in his quest for freedom. Law is very kind, but he's also stupid. The good kind of stupid though, the kind that makes you laugh because of his sheer stupidity. [strike] He's also your reliable Mystic Arte spam- [/strike]
- Dohalim il Qaras: a Renan and quite an important one. He arrives at Dahna and his very first act as a Renan is to stop Dahnan slavery and strive for equality between the Dahnans and the Renans. He really loves antiques, he can also be very oblivious.
- Kisara: one of the strongest Dahnan soldiers, serving one of the Five Lords. Highly regarded by Renan soldiers as well, she also acts as the ""mother"" of the party. In fact, she takes care of everyone's needs such as cooking and laundry, she also really loves fishing. She is also an absolute tank.

I personally think the party goes extremely well together, it is a joy to see them talking to each other with the well known ""skits"", typical of the Tales of series. I've never been bored one bit, the conversations are all very interesting and you can see the love put into the interactions between characters.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
And here is where everyone is suddenly divided between ""game good"" and ""game bad"".
Me? I'm more of a ""game good"" guy, but I can't deny that there are major flaws in Tales of Arise's combat.
You see, the game really encourages combo play and using different artes to keep the fight going, you are rewarded with an insta-kill attack if you manage to fight good enough. This goes for every enemy, that means you can insta-kill one and immediately attack the second one and start another combo chain for yet another insta-kill and so on. Insta-kills are basically two characters (of your choice) performing an unique attack, each combination having different attacks & animations so you are free to experiment.
Sounds good on paper, right? Well, the huge problem is: you are encouraged to perform combos, yet the enemies are extremely [b] against [/b] combos, that means they are [b] NEVER [/b] stunned unless you use certain party members' special attacks (which have a cooldown). So you are stuck dealing with what seems to be huge damage sponges, which can be severely exhausting halfway through the game. Me personally, I had to switch to easy mode because the amount of exp gained + the damage sponges were starting to turn me off, which is really sad considering the actual combat mechanics themselves are FUN.

[h1] Summary [/h1]
Now for the real question: [b] is Tales of Arise the best Tales of in the series? [/b]
That is entirely subjective, but if you had to ask me, I would say that this is indeed my favourite Tales of in the series, and that's saying a lot since I really loved Berseria and Xillia.
I personally think Tales of Arise absolutely deserved to win the best JRPG of 2021 and most of the people crying in the Steam Discussions are mostly just extremely mad either because they don't understand basic game mechanics or because [i] ""shin megoomy tensay deserved the award lol game awards rigged"" [/i] or even worse [i] ""lmao game censored because 4chan said so"" [/i].
Look, I am a big fan of the Shin Megami Tensei series, I played through the SMT series before they came on Steam, I 100% understand the frustration.
However, I also believe Tales of Arise really deserved to be the spotlight of 2021, this is the game that will finally bring the series to a bigger audience: the Final Fantasy VII of the FF series, the Persona 5 of the Persona series. And I couldn't possibly be happier for the developers who put their heart into this game, which you can clearly notice while playing.

Rating is subjective and I highly recommend playing the game for yourself.
With that said, I personally rate Tales of Arise:

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]

I loved this game, I am very glad I paid full price and supported the developers who put an immense amount of work to create this masterpiece. I am very glad these developers are finally getting acknowledged, I am very happy to see them thanking us, the Tales of community, for buying the game and supporting them.

The Tales of series has a bright future ahead, after all this time, and I am here to witness it.

Pros: 

1) The core gameplay is fun. If you liked the Star Ocean series, you'll like this. I did, so I did. The big monster fights especially are a treat. There's a decent amount of enemy variety too. 

2) The world is gorgeous. The art team really did put a lot of effort in, and it shows. There's a huge variety in locales and they all have a distinct visual language. Top marks for art. 

3) There are times when the dialogue can be funny without being deathly cringe. 

Cons:

1) I found the character development quite shallow. Item crafting is so weak that it might not as well be there, all the gear you find are more or less straight upgrades, and once you find the ""good"" moves, there doesn't seem to be much sense in using anything else. Spamming Alphen's Reigning Slash cleared 90% of the content for me without any difficulty whatsoever.

2) The writing can be hit or miss, and when it misses, boy does it miss. The plot is honestly interesting enough that I kept at it, but there were times I had to mute my speakers for how absolutely atrocious the dialogue was. 

3) This is kind of a minor thing, but I found the controller to be quite busy. There's a lot to do in fights, and it takes a bit to get used to. 

4) The soundtrack felt very bland to me. Maybe I'm spoiled, but it's no FFX. 

5) The endgame and the superbosses are weak as hell. 

Overall, it's a good title, and I'm glad I spent the $40. It's not the best JRPG out there, or the best on steam even, but it'll do a good job of tiding you over for that Star Ocean fix.",1641082749,1641082749,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i] Note: I have finished the game and am currently re-playing on the new game++ [/i]

Arise is my first foray into the Tales series but not necessarily my first time playing JRPGs. 
[u] The story [/u] itself is quite captivating. The characters are all lovable and relatable. The tried and true character archetypes like the good-natured hero, the wise one, the quirky one, the comic foil, the brooding one are all here without being too cliched. And as a social science academic, I was pleasantly surprised the game discusses issues of social inequalities and class differences. Although the excessive amounts of expositions, backstories and cut-scenes made it feel like a drag sometimes. The copious amounts of dialogue texts you have to read through did not help either, as at times it made me feel like I was reading a novel or watching a soap-opera rather than playing an actual video game. But these are to be expected of JRPGs and are not really problems… just my personal gripes.

[u] The animations [/u] of the characters are very fluid. As a fighting game player, I enjoy the fine little details they put into the run-cycle animations, the key-poses, the hit-stop animations and the idle animations. I have a firm belief that animations are more important than graphics since animations affect the very nature of ‘gameplay’ [i] (yes, looking at you Mortal Kombat/Injustice who always seem to do the exact opposite). [/i]

[u] The graphics [/u] here are charming too. The water color painted effect they slapped onto the simple cel-shaded, low-polygon models make a world of differences. And speaking of world, the world of Arise is stunning. The vibrant flowery plains of the countryside, the fairy tale-look of the Owl forest, the snowy hills and the astral night skies are sights to behold. [b] I wish there was a photo mode, which is such a staple these days. [/b]
  
[u] The combat [/u] even though I enjoy it for the most part was quite frustrating at times. For instance, the game will throw at you a level 30 enemy while you are at level 18. You just can’t defeat them; thus, the need for intense grinding to level up. But once you level up, it’s fun and rewarding to do combos and chaining supers which, as a fighting game player, I thoroughly enjoy.

[u] The music [/u] is brilliant to say the least. The uplifting world music, the stern battle themes, the gothic orchestrations of the castles, the catchy and emotional j-pop ballads all sync so well into the world of Arise. They evoke a sense of nostalgia and exude a sense of emotional connection to the characters and the world of Arise. Without spoiling too much, the short-animated video over a j-pop ballad was especially my absolute favorite.
 
This game, which obviously is not a perfect game, somehow passes all my personal criteria of what a good game should have: [b] good animation, good gameplay, good music. [/b] And if you are the type of person who supports these criteria too and who likes anime, I recommend you play this game.

But you will find yourself skipping interactions because its just more of the same dialog just different wording.

I'd compare this with Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Abyss in terms of tone and quality- and I'd argue those two were the best in the series, though I'm beginning to suspect this entry might top those two.

I'm not super-far into the game, but so far I'm enjoying the more intense tone of the story and the wire-tight tension the party members have with each other.

Enemies felt the same throughout the entire game with little variation with the fights take a long time. I ended up escaping most fights out of boredom, but then didn't have a high enough level to fight the bosses.  
The side quests are necessary to level up and have enough gold for items and upgrades, but they were low effort quests with no relation to the main story that I had zero interest in doing.

Enemie design Just so many Repeating enemy variations

Menus vaguely confusing

Story:
Not much is going on honestly. Very linear story and nothing too interesting. Feel like a kids cartoon.  Characters relationship are ok there are alot of cut scene of characters talking but its mostly just meaningless chitchat. 
Quest:  
it's soo boring. Mostly just go to this place fight monsters along the way random miniboss then fight more monsters and fight main boss and repeat. And the side quest are even worse just boring ass chores with little reward. 
Gameplay.
Combats is not bad alot of mechanics however gets pretty repetitive. The gear progression is terrible tho. Its pretty much just find better gear equip it cause it always ha e better stats. There's no bonus stats or effects or set bonuses. Weapon pretty much the same.

[b]Truths[/b]
[list]
[*]It's a balanced game difficulty wise. A casual player would feel comfy playing for the most part. Definitely has some hard fights, but if a player goes in with proper arts and CP management it can be easier to handle. If a player wants hard mode I think they might need to buy a bundle for it? I just play normal mode. Definitely invest in improving the characters’ stats, ignore new arts until then imo, a player will have a better time and do more dmg. If a player wants to play all the characters, it's best to practice with them for a bit until they get used to them. Practice with the Strategy feature to find what fits with each character. 
[*]Side quests are easily understood, though I recommend the developers give players the use of colorful or certain shape markers on maps.
[*]Some players might feel Tales of Arise is way too dramatic for a story that isn't too complex. I think it works well enough, and I rather characters have emotions than just seem incapable of sympathising, getting angry, being concerned, realising a situation that affects others can be horrifying or heartbreaking. The world in the game has a lot of things to be concerned about, so I find the emotion that comes with it fits.
[*]The story isn't the most creative, but was made to be easily understood for a wide aged audience. I find that good especially since it's a Tales game. Having a player see different sides of races is interesting. Everyone is capable of good and evil actions, there is no black or white. I think the story is decent, can show an impressionable younger player to consider thinking and discussing hard topics outside of gaming. Games can actually teach people to be better people imo.
[*] The game is dialogue heavy but the way they made the mini scenes work was fun, and a player can easily skip through it or speed up if they're a fast reader. Those who played other Tales games likely appreciate both the dialogue and being able to have the choice to speed through it or take their time.
[/list]

[b]Appreciation[/b]
[list]
[*]Being detail observant, the game has a painterly feeling with it's style, which I found refreshing. A lot of games try to be hyper realistic or very anime cell shading style. Tales of Arise sort of mixed both and made it work. The models matched the environment style. I like different styles of games if it works well. This works well.
[*]The way they successfully animated a model's expressions with feeling kept me engaged. The way they handled the eyes and lashes is beautiful. Model movement felt fluid, even when jumping off a platform, the body trying to stop itself after landing looked realistic from it's momentum. Past attempts were stiff and lacked convincing expression. 
[*]The way some of the scenes were done were surprising, I really didn't expect certain camera shots and action.
[/list]

[b]Nitpicks[/b]
[list]
[*]It's time they made it faster to climb ladder/other obstacles, make it so jumping isn't just stopped by invisible walls.
[*]Kisara's lack of protective armor in the back....It's so stupid I am constantly annoyed anytime I see her from the back. At least Iron Mask/ [spoiler]Alphen[/spoiler] has full armor...Bad enough characters like Shionne wear a ripped butt cape dress...sis you're gonna get nabbed. Her hair is perfect to grab and rip too. At least design a hairstyle that won't make someone want to yank it in a fight. Pretty but impracticable...if you wanna have both, be smart about it.
[*]Make it so outfits can be removed, it was honestly incredibly annoying they couldn't be removed. My thought as to the reason was likely because most of the armors didn't have a 'skin' to them. I really appreciated everything else anyway. I personally like having a big wardrobe in games, likely because I get bored of a look easily, and I previously played games that had that, so take this comment with a grain of salt.
[*]Earning EXP and SP is so slow, I despise that, but at least it's not like Genshin. A player can earn more with certain recipes or even store bundles with artefacts. Artefacts can also be found in the game itself.

The default controller setup is weird, you might want to customise them. I've noticed some difficulty spikes, especially with the second big baddy you face off. Even though I can blast through every encounter before it, the boss hits hard and tanks hits better than the beefcake that is the previous boss, which I had no trouble with even though the level gap was bigger for me in that encounter.

Even on ""Story"" difficulty, which is supposed to be for people who don't enjoy the combat, enemies still take *forever* to kill.  Bosses can take like 10 minutes of mindless mashing.  Really awful.

The story is... fine?  Pretty average for an RPG story.  It's nice that they tried to have themes around slavery & hatred and such, but it's handled pretty poorly.  The characters don't behave like people, to the point where I started laughing during one of the emotional death scenes.

The companions are arguably my favorite of any game I've played. When you get the full party, it actual feels like a band of friends with the same end-goal. It isn't pointless banter and saying they develop characters, but each one has their own arc, and they all help each other grow, and sometimes bud heads with some opinions. 

I didn't love the game till I hit the third realm, which took me around 13 hours on hard. I went from playing 1-3 hours a day for the first two realms because I felt the characters were bland, boring, and the writing seemed pretty bad. Then I went to a minimum of 4 hours a day when I hit the 3rd realm. The game just gets so much better, the characters actually start to feel real and they actually start to develop a ton.

I felt the same way a lot of people do in the negative reviews, but if you really want to give the game a solid try, I would complete the third realm. If you did that, and still don't enjoy the game, you're not going to enjoy the rest of the game and you can drop it saying you gave it a good try.

If you want to see minor spoilers of what to expect from the characters in the third realm, read below if you really dislike how they are in the first two realms.

[spoiler] In the third realm, you start to understand Shionne's character a lot and you get a little bit of insight of why she acts the way she does.

The XP curve is balanced around you buying the $5 DLC that doubles it. Which means generally doing all of the quests in an area will get you about half way to being the correct level for the next part. 

The combat is a delight, built around doing combos that move from the air to the ground. There are so many characters to choose from but the main character generally feels the best and most suited to manual play. 
The difficulty curve, however is terrible. It swings from ""as easy as possible"" until you face a boss, where it ramps up to ""Expect to die many times despite using all of your items"". At no point does the game maintain a state of flow or fun challenge. I expect this is also to encourage the buying DLCs that boost your money, skill points, and even levels. 

The story is okay, if nothing special. Most beats are very predictable but in a comfortable way. The characters are mostly enjoyable and the amount of optional dialog you can pop up any time you press the RB button is incredible. 

The game is also beautiful, but the demo picks the most beautiful and well paced area in the game, which means everything else is slightly worse. 

Also massive story spoilers are in several of the menus because they try to sell you more DLC that are skins for characters you may not know about yet. 

I regret buying this at full price, i regret playing as long as i did, and because of the horrible DLC treatment i will probably not be buying another tales game in the future. It's a shame because it had real potential.

The rest of the game is an easy 8/10, not revolutionary or game of the year, but a great experience nontheless.

The combat is by far the best part of this game, which is great since you'll be doing it for about half the time. It's very frantic but also very polished. Once you have a full party it can sometimes be tough figuring out exactly whats going on while tons of spells are being cast. Some enemy attacks are really vague on how to avoid or counter but they are relatively easy once you figure it out. I tried it on the medium difficulty and I didn't have to do any grinding, though I still had to avoid a couple optional areas until I leveled up naturally through the main story.

I tried to complete all the side quests that I could do one one playthrough and that comes in at around 46 hours, so without all those side quests I'm guessing around 35-40 hours. 

All the main characters are pretty fleshed out and very well developed through all the little skits that pop up everywhere. These skits are literally everywhere, usually a couple after every new section of an area or some quest progress. The villains are pretty flat though, pretty much all of them simply want power and will kill anyone in the process, nothing more than that.

The main story was pretty good until you figure out the ""truth"" at around halfway where it goes from being rebels to free slaves to saving two worlds in space. Nothing was exactly surprising with lots of foreshadowing but the game does a big info dump when being told the ""truth"" which is the laziest part of the story. Of course it ends up with saving both worlds and everybody lives happily. 

The visuals are absolutely beautiful. So much details in all the environments, in-game cutscenes are great aside from some lip syncing, music is great too. The enemy designs are pretty standard though with only about 10 or so basic designs of varying colors depending on the area. Basic dragons, animals, and humanoid enemies.",1640423602,1640423602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest complaints with this game is the lack of memorable music (although the music that's there fits the mood), the grind on higher difficulties in the latter half of the story, and the final dungeon is just awful design, with enemies pretty much being damage sponges, and the abundance of them is absurd, with no real way to go back for extra items. I am, of course, speaking from experience on the HARD mode the game offers. I picked it because I wanted a challenge and a challenge it was until the end where everything just took too long to kill, making boredom sink in a little more with every battle.

The story is kind of slow at the beginning and sometimes a little inconsistent. The evolution of the main character (the one who keeps pushing people away) makes sense, but it feels unnatural. However I liked the plot-twists, the skits and the mysterious world where there's always a lot of secrets to be uncovered. I understand that the story builds up slowly because it's trying to build a world with really dark unsolved problems.

I didn't like bosses, it would have been nice to know more about them and their individual motivations, rather than a late game generic explanation, specially for one of them who seems to be evil just because.

I really love how much social criticism there is in this game. It covers the obvious colonialism problem, but also a lot about who's truly free, and who's really in control. Many of the regimes in this fantasy world look a lot like real-life history. It also covers over-exploitation of natural resources, classism and racism. So try to pay attention to the sociopolitical aspect of the game and how real it is. I can't give more details without spoilers.

Since it's a Tales game, expect to have a lot of character introspection and conversations about deep topics. There's actually some good life advice among the thousands of conversations this game has to offer; it cat get pretty relatable. The characters are far from perfect, having each of them their own insecurities and flaws; you'll hear a lot about their daily life struggles through hundreds of fully dubbed skits. The voice acting is also very good. I don't like the voice acting and the tropes being so anime-like, with exaggerated reactions and generic uncomfortable scenes, but it's still fun and enjoyable. Anyway, I think that the world is a lot more captivating than the characters in this one.

The gameplay is nice, it feels smooth and satisfying once you get the hang of it (I played only manual mode). I have my favorite character (the mage), but it's still nice to control the rest of them. My first playthrough was on Moderate difficulty and I enjoyed the challenge; it wasn't too difficult, just enough to make me rethink my strategy every now and then, providing a lot more satisfaction after big fights. I had no trouble beating the game doing all side quests and absolutely no grinding (which I love), I just killed whatever was in my way and my level was always good enough for the challenge at hand. The battles are engaging and visually stunning, including amazing effects and badass animations/finishers.

I don't think the DLCs are worth it, but I didn't buy any of them, so decide for yourself.

Great graphics, performance, visuals, voice acting, music, mechanics and world design. Loved it. A great addition to the franchise.",1640367623,1640381406,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

My main issues are:

1. Ads. I was able to fight this off completely by adding strict DENY rules to my firewall to all of the game's network traffic. Then it fails to load ads and thus they are not rendered. But like - why does it take to be an engineer to fight with the product I bought fair and square??

2. DLC push. Less intrusive, still not great. Also the way it's mechanically woven into the game is jarring. You really are ""heavily encouraged"" to get those DLCs to have in-game advantage and that's terrible. I don't know any way to get around this so yeah.

3. Wokeness. This is one of the biggest issues I have when listening to the dialogues and character's exchange. Without spoiling too much: I hate it when male characters are portrayed as incompetent, not able to feel the situation, moronic and obtuse weaklings who are all ""sorry"" and ""that's my fault"" in all cases (even when it's clear that's unfair) while females are carried by the plot always knowing it all, patronizing attitude, excessively rude for no reason, being better in anything and everything and treating male ones like children. Just listening to the reaction to same things based on the character gender makes my blood boil. Only saving grace is that it's not all of the cast is like that, though the one with such a princess complex is one I can't get rid of. 
[spoiler]One of (many, many) examples, not exact quotes:
<Male messes up>
 - Female: Get it together you loser!
 - Male: Ah.. yes, yes, sorry, I will try better..

versus

<Female messes up>
- Male: Please be careful next time!
- Female: Don't dare to patronize me, wimp!
- Male: Oh, sorry, didn't mean it..

... yeah. Pathetic.
[/spoiler]

4. Weak plot line. I know, I know - I didn't finish the thing, yet after 8 hours I think it's already safe to judge about overall quality of it. And.. it's not there. It's not terrible, but it makes me struggle to want to progress, it lacks that ""what's next, I want to know!"" feeling completely.

There's a reason that an ally gets a Resurrection spell right off the bat, is what I'm saying.

Now, I know Tales games. The combat always starts off slow, clunky, and barely functions all so that it can improve greatly as more mechanics, skills, and allies are unlocked. But. I had to enjoy the game to actually get to that point, and I wasn't. The characters are tropes down to a T, making them feel hollow and one-dimensional. The game doesn't really look that great, visually. The story is... Stupid? It's all just really disappointing.

On top of all of that, there's no FOV slider. The camera is just way too close to the character you control in the overworld to the point it was making me slightly ill. I have a huge 4k screen- having a character's body take up a third of it while the world whizzes by is just vomit inducing.

This game is an experiment of such matter. I am more than impressed with BANDAI NAMCO for this experiment. Knowing that this is a title commemorating the 25th Tales Anniversary, the did the usual integration of other tales characters (something to be expected if you played one before).

The drawbacks include way shorter gameplay (probably half of Berseria/Vesperia) relative to other Tales games so far (probably permissible considering an experiment), and certainly the reduction of artes from 20 (with controller) to 12 (or probably 6 if Aerial artes are not much used frequently).

In relation to difficulty, it is indeed Vesperia-like, so be prepared for tons of frustrations.

Weak plot, milquetoast character development, bad writing.  Worst of all, combat is insanely boring.  I regret finishing it.

The writing was the biggest weak point of the game.  Plot, characters, dialog should all have been redone before release.  The localization was terrible, particularly the text.  The voice acting was very good given the shit script to work with. But even then, the voice and text rarely matched, and the text was full of typos. 

Graphics were often pretty, but more often overdone with inexplicably over-detailed, distracting objects of no story or mechanical importance.  Shionne is pretty, and she's likeable, which I guess is the main selling point of the game... but she's such an ass of a tsundere to Alphen she's not waifu material. 

Combat system is truly terrible.  It's an action RPG, but they act like you're going to take some overly complicated combat system and develop some deep strategy for 10 minute battles.  You don't, though.  You just spam the fastest attack you have or put it on auto combat.  Seriously, if it wasn't for automated combat and Very Easy mode, I would never have bothered finishing it because combat is so paradoxically frenetic, painfully slow and boring.  You get milliseconds to react in some situations, and then have to wait minutes for anything important to happen again.  And of course, space-age rifle bullets still don't do as much damage as a punch... But when an attack does 50 damage and the boss has 500,000 hp there's bigger problems.

And then there's the old JRPGs being JRPGs, where you have to have upskirt shots, 14 year olds who can do what adults training their whole life can't do, animist magic that comprises half the plot but has almost no comprehensible theory to it, dozens of named attacks that all do the same things except with different animation and shouting of names, inexplicably saying someone's name in the middle of having a conversation with them, etc.  

The only place Arise shines over other JRPGs is that Hootle is actually a good mascot character, with exactly the correct number of spoken lines (zero).",1639958942,1640303937,False,2,0,0.397483706474304199,0,True,False,False

And Let me start off by saying, I loved this game. I think it was awesome.

I loved the characters, Loved the story, loved the badass action fighting gameplay.

I took my time playing it and that's how I got 70 hours but i think the game is probably more like 50-60 hours.

And so no one else is unsure (like I was)

YES THERE IS ROMANCE.

It's rather subtle and starts up around the halfway point, but it has a great happy ending. 

I love a good role playing game with romance. And this has great writing, great action, great length, and great romance. I loved this game. What can I say? Just get it and play it. It was awesome.",1640294665,1640294665,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Play type: I cleared all side quests as they appeared and went forward to beat the main game. After the main storyline, more quests appeared that I am currently chewing through. 
Great game that I would definitely buy again.
Pros:
- No need to buy any of the addons, that's what mods are for! Minimal effort installing mods (drag and drop)
- Quests are laid out with minimal backtracking.
- The story kept growing and getting deeper. At various times when I thought I finally beat the, ""final boss"" a new challenger appeared! Everything was wrapped up nicely in the end without a need for an expansion pack.
- Mechanics: I played through under the native Japanese language and was allowed to skip through dialogue as needed. 
Cons: 
- No damn widescreen support!? Running with 1/4 of the monitor unused was not a pleasant sight.
- Draw distance for enemies and intractable characters needs to be improved. A mod did fix it until a patch was pushed out mid December 2021.

would suggest, if you have a strong enough pc, to use the visual upgrade you can get from the mod on nexus - lets you see mobs/npcs/landscape features much further away along with some other upgrades

I like how the story progress and the characters definitely grow on you as the story goes on. Also, The voice actors are good. It's rare for me to use English voice in JRPG games. The dialogues and cutscenes are fun to watch. Especially the skits, their humor makes me laugh and continue to love the characters. Though, unlike previous tales games. Most of the skits are hard to collect or find. But on Arise, it's easy to find and you can watch it at the Camp anytime you want. 

The Graphics are absolutely amazing. I love the character design and the world building. In the beginning of the combat was kind of hard since you're limited to use the skills because of the AG(the one you use every time you use the skills) cooldown. But in the middle or late part of the game, you can use it more since you can get more AG slots and ways to recover it fast. I also love the boost attack of every members, they can help you it depends on your enemies. I enjoyed doing fishing on this game, it's one of my favorite feature of the game. Some of the side quests are worth your time, there's one late side quest that connected to one of your characters so don't missed that. 

There is one minor Con that I want to point out. I wish they did some feedback or info to the recipes that you already cooked. So that it's easy to determine if what are the recipes that you already finished. Maybe a ""Done"" indicator or other color that represent the recipes that you already done.

-I did not like the combat for this game at all. I actually set it to auto and left it there after the 3rd boss. Wasn't thrilled with Zes/Ber combat but I was able to play the game without it ruining things. It didn't feel responsive and I couldn't figure out how to do the power up states. Camera wasn't good either.

-Story. Political crap the entire way through. Spoiler [spoiler] slavery is bad mm'kay. forgiving someone makes you morally superior mm'kay. repeat this mantra every 3 seconds and you'll be a better person than everyone else mm'kay [/spoiler] . Also, the story is pretty much a rewrite of Eternia, with some Logan's Run and Mass Effect thrown in this time. It would be mediocre as is, the political chanting is mind numbing and makes the story trash in my opinion.

-Writing. Childish, condescending and repetitive. Hey, let's have all the characters waste 2-5 minutes recapping that cutscene we just saw. Every. Single. Time. Hey, let's not assume people are intelligent enough to figure out those subtle hints we just gave. Instead we're going to bash their skull in with another 5 minute skit scene that totally negates those subtle hints. I felt nothing for the story or the characters except annoyance from start to finish. Hootle gets a pass because he didn't have any dialogue, he just hooted. Maybe all the characters should have, might have been somewhat enjoyable then.

I think I have left reviews for 5 or so games, and all of them were less than a paragraph. I actually made notes as I played this so I could focus my thoughts for this review. I knew by the 3rd boss I would be writing this review if things didn't make an earth shattering change for the better. First Tales game I have played that I didn't like, not a single part of it. Pretty sure i paid full price for it too, because I thought ""it's a Tales game, it's worth it."" I honestly haven't looked at the other reviews for the game, I think it says ""mostly/overwhelmingly"" positive. I really don't know what game they all played through. Whether it's blind brand loyalty, a lack of exposure to good/great stories and writing, or they're just easy to please. I most likely will not buy the next Tales game unless it hits $15 or less and I hear their theming is completely different. It won't affect Namco at all and I don't pretend it will nor do I declare it to self-aggrandize.

The boss battles offered these weird spike in difficulty compared to every other fight. I don't expect a boss to be easy but the way they handled things was just weird compared to other games. 
Normal fights became super repetitive real fast and there is little pay out for the fights. 
Money grinding was so annoying but that's cause I personally do not like selling things as my only source of income because I always wonder if I would have needed such and such item later. That's just me though. 
The difficulty settings didn't feel like it made a difference. If I found a a fight too hard I lowered it down to normal and still got the same results until I went for the lowest difficulty. I probably shouldn't have worried about my allies to so much cause that caused me to mess up a lot. Tried looking up a couple of the bosses cause the difficulty just seemed unnatural, turns out it was because all they had was increased damage and health. Damage sponges that can one shot you cause that = harder for some reason but they hit the same way even though my levels were higher than other peoples. They really want you to perfect the dodge instead of just making it like the other games where you needed strategy. Here it's dodge like crazy and maybe hit while your allies stand right under any attack coming at them and die and to rarely dodge. I think the game might be more playable solo because your allies are so useless. You have to control them manually to stop them to make them avoid attacks. 
Each character also has this special move they can use once some bar fills up from attack and instead of them just be special power moves they are needed to avoid certain things and an enemy can spam their stuff twice screwing you over. A few of those same moves have no use outside of countering a few enemy attacks so they are mostly pointless. 
Unless past games, controlling anyone else is not enjoyable and not worth the effort. 
This game series seems to have a heavy amount of nostalgia carrying it cause it is far from good. Kind of like the Pokemon series. Tales of Berseria is more playable then this garbage of game and you can beat it. You also don't fall asleep at the cutscenes and skits every time they show up.

- Beautiful environments
- Easiest/Most Intuitive Battle System I've seen in Tales
- Stylistic choices such as the UI are excellent

Cons:
- By far, the biggest con: the skits in this game are terrible. They are all something along the lines of: 
1. Let's defeat the bad guy!
2. Some conversations being so similar I think: ""wait, didn't this conversation happen in another skit?""
On top of that, the humor from previous games just isn't here.
- Poor characters and character development. I don't actually mind tropes, they exist for a reason after all. But these characters take JRPG tropes and reduce them to their lowest form. The purpose of a trope is to take a concept and build on it to produce a likeable character. Unfortunately, there's nothing else to these characters besides conforming to a trope, so much so that it feels similar a checklist.
- Poor writing. The premise of this game is excellent, if someone told me about it before playing it, I would assume the story in this game is quite good. But it's not--the execution of the script is poor and the story is not enjoyable. Usually with Tales games the second half of the story is far better than the first but in my opinion, Tales of Arise failed to hit this mark.

Overall, this game has not been a pleasant experience. The decent parts  could not make up for the poor characters, story and skits.

TL;DR: Overall a very solid game, I'd give it 8.7/10. Main strenght is the combat system, especially if you crank the difficulty setting to Hard. Visually pleasant game, although a bit alike FF13 in terms of how zones are built (ie. linear with the few nooks off path for treasures). Shorter than Tales of Berseria by 50 hours at least, easy to get 100% achievements (nothing really missable). Audio tracks are nice, but repetitive. Story was good in the first half in my opinion, then felt a bit weaker in second half. Side-quests are sadly forgettable. JRPG artstyle (waifu potential) without the usual annoying characters; characters personalities are fleshed out. Worth a buy if you are a fan of the Tales series. I straight-up remove 1/10 on my grading because of how abusive the DLCs are (they are cash-grab). End of TL;DR.

Combat:
Recommendation: I played the whole game on Hard difficulty. This kept the game honest and made boss fight actually a fight rather than just mashing button until the boss died. You will require to setup the strategy tab so your AI teammates don't consume all your pricey consumables. Deciding when to consume items is key to conserve your CP early-mid game when your Gald (money) is low, unless you bought the DLCs (more on that later).

The Tales series is a bit reminiscent of the direction FF13 took a few years back. Being an active combat system, you will setup your attacks (called artes) to create combos in regards to enemy weaknesses. The game does a good job of introducing new mechanics slowly. At regular intervals, you will learn something new: regular artes, boosts strikes, CP, breaks, overlimits, new characters, strategies, 2nd artes tab, etc. A new player shouldn't be too overwhelmed, but I found the first boss fight confusing at time (your screen is filled with AoE at times). You eventually get used to it and understand what is going on.

The only drawback of such a system as opposed to a traditional RPG is that I've played as Alphen for 90% of the game, occasionally switching to Rimwell (mage) or Shionne (healer). You also get a lot of artes and most overlap or don't feel effective in any way. In the end, you will probably use a few Artes over and over.

DLC and in-game economy:
If you strive to buy every weapons/armors and get 1 or 2 ""best-in-slot"" accessory per character, you will need a lot of Gald. If you played on Hard as well, the healing items (notably Orange Gel) aren't cheap and I was forced between grinding for money or pay for a predatory DLC. Basically, with a few key DLCs you will gain double xp, skill points and 500k money. 500k money is what I basically earned through the course of my non-DLC playthrough, so it's a lot of money. I really disliked that practice for single-player game. DLC should be for cosmetics only, like outfits for the people out there who seeks waifus in JRPG (which is not my thing). So overall, if you are like me and refuse to invest into their DLCs, be prepared to fish a lot (mini-game) and farm crystal nodes to sell them. This breaks the flow of the game drastically, sadly.

You need to buy the weapons and keep them to eventually get upgraded versions out them. In retrospect though, most dungeons will provide the player with new armors and even weapons, so you could save a lot of money by not buying any armors and buying a few key weapons so you get an actual power spike rather than a few points of extra damage. Also, sell the obsolete armors instead of hoarding like I did.

Story:
Storyline is centered around slavery and oppression. The theme is maintained throughout the game and consistent. Every zones offers another facet of said theme. There is a lot of FF7 and FF15 undertones of amnesia, Sephiroth-like nemesis and journey with friends, cooking and fishing mini-game. Side-quests are usually really weak. Fishing is fun, yet easy even with the 2nd rod to catch Boss fishes. Skits (cinematic dialogues) are usually pleasant to listen to, but I felt that the second half (Lenegis) of the game bombard you with skits after skits up to the point that you barely play within an hour, you just listen to the same conversation. The ending phase is a bit vague, JRPG-style where it gets overly complicated to justify a ""let's save the world from oblivion"" scenario.

Post-game:
The post-game content is your typical power-grind to fight bigger challenges. It was somewhat fun and almost only concentrated on combat, which I enjoyed. The Spirit Temple provided me with the better challenges/most fun. There is a NG+ and you could crank the difficulty to Chaos or Unknown for replay value, but I was satisfied after a single playthrough to call it a day.",1639852057,1639852253,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

+ Improvements over the Berseria battle system include: slowdown after perfect evasion lifted straight from Bayonetta, dedicated jump button, dedicated aerial artes.
+ Central theme in the story is well-realized and lingers with you when credis roll.
+ A romance subplot that properly resolves.
+ Wholesome, happy ending despite the first impression of going more grim dark than previous Tales.
+ No Denuvo.
+ Using Unreal Engine means the PC version is easy to create and install ""spicy"" ""cosmetic mods"".
- Healing items heal flat amounts unlike everything else in the game which heal by percentage, thus they scale terribly in late game.
- No more Holy Bottle and Dark Bottle. These were quality-of-life items to help you encounter less (Holy Bottle) or more (Dark Bottle) enemies on the field in previous Tales games.
- Shopping menu doesn't let you buy/sell by in one batch like Berseria, also no Equipment screen quick access from shopping menu like Berseria.
- Ambiguous skill description. You never know how much ""Increased Critical Damage"" means despite multiple skills with different skill point costs saying the same ambiguous ""increased something"" description.
- No battle victory screen, that means no battle result breakdown. Enjoy yelling ""How tf did I get NEGATIVE combat points from that fight???"" multiple times.
- Normal attack returns and it's the worst normal attack implementation in a Tales game yet. Reduces standard arte bindings from 4 to 3 and goes through the same repetitive animation every time.
- Combo customization from Berseria and Zestiria is gone, further limiting your combo variety.
- Switching in characters from back row is a mechanic for which there is no in-game tutorial and its implementation is worse than Berseria's equivalence.
- Skits use 3d models and look much less expressive than hand-drawn skits from previous Tales.
- Lazy side quests. More quantity and less quality than Berseria's side quests.
- Villains have little depth to speak of.
- Obvious plot holes: earth realm is liberated for 7 years and news never reached snow realm yet fire realm is liberated for 1 week and snow realm already came begging for help from fire realm; ""Fruit of Helgan"" somehow got its name despite the Helganquil brainwashed their own existence from the humans; water realm's total subjugation happened in only 7 years even though violence and fear have only caused rebel cells to form in other realms; etc...

You could tell they put a lot of work into the story telling and combat system. The combat is fun and engaging, but some fights are questionable.

 I would have given the game 9.5/10, if the ending didn't ruin it for me. I would probably give Tales of Arise a rating of somewhere around 6.5-7/10. The reason for this is the first 40 hours were great, I would give it a 9.5/10, but the last 15-20 hours were atrociously disappointing. The lead up to the final area, the final area, and the ending itself was very poorly done and it, painstakingly obvious, was rushed. I'd probably give the last 15-20 hours of the game a 4/10, bringing my overall rating of the game to about 7/10, more leaning towards around a 6.8/10.

Would I recommend the game? Probably not. I started playing Tales series games starting with Tales of Symphonia on the Game Cube. There are a number of them I found fantastically done, and they've all pretty much got their own quirks for them for pros and cons. Despite how Tales of Arise did a lot of things right, they really should not have sacrificed the denouement of the game.

I did quite like the slight shift back to tales of symphonia/vesperia style of combat which was from basic attacks to artes compared to Berseria which was pure arte moves that you would mix and match for limited combos. I do hate how they are using the burst limit in this game, with it being a semi-random activation which could've been cool to instead be an active that you could use to extend a combo even more (although, since bosses can't be combo'd, it would only be useful on basic mobs...) The characters were good, the story was fine with some decent plot twists. So yeah, i do recommend, i did almost everything this game had to offer, all i did not do were the ultimate arena battles and major boss rush sidequest (which i attempted but failed because i ran out of healing reserve and items) I much preferred when we had mp instead of a heal reserve that can be replenished with extremely pricey consumables since the ai's are not good dodgers and the MC literally hurts himself in combat to do his super moves, having a harder time healing is kinda dumb. I legit stopped using him in the main party and used him as a boost attack that always staggered instead, since that way he was safe from dying. Other then that, i only found 2 characters that actually had easy and feasible combo potential out of the whole cast, 1 kept dropping combos, one was too ""I need to perfect dodge before i can have fun and i still drop a bunch of combos with my floaty attacks"" and the mages and gunner girls i just didn't bother really trying them. I did do their arena and i overall just hated that we couldn't properly combo with them with the brief time i used them. Also, you get post-game quest pre-post game, reason why i say that is because they are level 60-70 and i did them before i did the final dungeon and they are technically quite plot relevent to be done before it, you get them when you are like only level 45 and heading to the final dungeon. i did do them before the final boss but i dropped the difficulty to easy since i was 20 levels below it, after that, the rest of the pacing for the game and post game was on normal which needed no grinding for.

I enjoy some of the Tales of games, and im a biiig-time supporter of Tales of Vesperia. I've even consideres getting a ToV inspired tattoo. That game got me through some shit. 
But man what a let down this game was.
I played it for 6 hours straight the first day I could and enjoyed a fresh Tales of, game with my friend on a call. 
But slowly over the span of aobut 29 hours the game just fucking drained me. I had to take a break and come back to it on a later date. But that never came. 
I felt like that booting it up and just checking was a chore, and im not about that. 
If I could refund this game by now, i'd do it in a heartbeat.

I even beat an 'overleveled' dragon miniboss in a field, and all I got was 1ish level to my team and some garbage crafting items. And 'pre-finished a quest before getting the area companion and defeating the area boss. 
Got some cash, but that shit dissapears faster that my interest in this game.


Here are some of my thoughts.

Positive:
Cool plot-driven character designs
Fun at first combat but tiersome mid and later on.

Negative:
Close to no freedom to roam or freedom at all. (Good thing Vesperia is on steam)
Cliche plot and character development
Repetative combat
Constantly reused enemies
Insane difficulty spike on bosses compared to fights against scrub enemies, on normal difficulty
So. Much. Dialoge. (I guess this frustrates me more since I don't like the characters)

Hope I stop thinking about this game and that I stop getting commercials on it now.

Honestly, I'd give this game a 6/10. It's.....okay? Buy it if it's on sale but don't expect too much from it.
If you're a long time Tales Of fan, you know what you're getting into and how their games can be hit or miss.

If this is your first Tales Of game, just know there are so many better options so i would not recommend this one for new players. Tales of Arise does the series an injustice.

--STORY--
Like I said, it's okay. Person sets out to destroy evil. Meets friends. Friendship wins. The plot of most tales of games but this one makes it worse by having the protagonist be a clueless himbo and the female lead be a racist tsundere. Fastforward and they meet some people that make them better people. 

The beginning of the game was hard to get through. I thought about putting it down several times just because of these two characters. The middle of the game got a lot better by adding more characters so it wasn't as cringe. The ending just felt repetitive by the end of the game too. I just didn't enjoy it or felt like it had an exciting plot or in depth characters like other tales of games. It felt like a modern approach to a JRPG with modern issues embedded. It felt like they tried to take a page from Star Ocean’s space and time continuum plot and use it to connect the past 3 games together. 

I’ve heard alot of people say the opposite though, but that is my take on the story. I didn't enjoy it.

That being said: It is a beautiful game. Some maps had me just moving the camera around. The new colored manga panel approach to the skits is actually a lot more appealing than the other way Bandai had them set up too. I just wish the dialogue was better.

--COMBAT--
Wonderful. 10/10. The AI is decent, but towards end game bosses you have to baby them a bit and direct their skills. (which is to be expected. No raging at AI like in Zestiria)
There are set scenarios you can program for each character.
The reskinned arcane arts for the main character are a unique blend and stylization to the game play. I have never been a big “use health for more DPS” player but holy shit I see the appeal of it now.
The flow of the combat and the new Mystic Arts are gorgeous. The first Tales game I played gave me goosebumps and this game made me re-experience that. 
The bosses are challenging but not overpowering. It's enjoyable. 100% the reason why I continued playing.
The only bad thing I came across is the auto lock on. There also is no way to have AI attack the same monsters. I had to use boost attacks to get the main DPS AI to lock onto monsters i was focusing on or just had to switch who i was locked on to and hope it didn't hop around again.

--DUNGEONS--
They are repetitive. Pretty. Real Pretty, but Real repetitive. They didn't really have any puzzles, it was more like there's 7 different layers to a map but you have to find a level to get to the next one. OOPS.
Same with the end game dungeon. It felt more like a DLC extra that included characters that have no effect on the story and are just there as an easter egg. Plus it gives you ungodly amounts of EXP so you can go in at level 50 and come out at 90 by just lazily progressing. After the main story, I auto battled everything until bosses.It was not a challenge at all. (they did add a new difficulty to the game tho after 3 weeks of it being out so that might make it better. I did not test it out.)
Best in slot weapons don't have to be crafted and are instead dropped or given out in the end game dungeon. The crafting section felt more like a separate weapons store and not like crafting or synthesizing. The items you need are not hard to drop or find. I didn't have to farm for anything.

--OVERALL--
The game felt lazy and repetitive. The combat is great, the story is okay. The skits are really nice. The monsters and maps are gorgeous. Combat is pretty but not challengings like other games. I would buy it if it was on sale and skip the main cut scenes. The characters re-explain everything in the skits afterwards anyways, 3 different times each time a major plot point happens. The 2D animation looks like it was put in because they ran out of budget end game. It just left me underwhelmed for the series. But maybe they are just trying to appeal to a newer audience.

If you're looking to try a Tales game for the first time, don't go with this one. Go with Vesperia or Symphonia. Better plots, more likeable characters, and challenging end game dungeons if that's your thing..",1634266162,1639496878,False,10,3,0.570481598377227783,0,True,False,False

I got mix feelings about this game.
OK your new into the world of TALES OF.... go ahead play it!
Other than that... I am kinda DISAPOINTING…
YOUR ONLY PLAYING A FANCY MOVIE…(a great one by the way, WE CAN’T ARGUE ABOUT GRAPHICS HERE).
But then the rest is …… blaaaaaah……

******GRAPHICS*******
EXCELLENT you do notice that the spent hours creating this amazing DETAIL world
BUT
the work of many hours is useless in a game IF THERES NOTHING TO DO THERE!!, there’s places that are completely EMPTY, few interactions, limited number of encounters, is like they wanted to fake an open world game.

******GAMEPLAY********
Everything works fine, it’s a freaking tales game…. they already got the formula
BUT
(AND HERE IS WHERE YOU FAIL ME THE MOST)

**EXTREMLY LINEAL GAME!!!!!!!!!!  --- WHAT HAPPEN WITH THE FREAKING EXPLORING THE WORLD COMING AND GOING!!!!

**SUB MISIONS - they are there only as an excuse for gaining a few more hours, ALL-THE-SAME, long a go u used to go around talking to everyone to get to them, now they are on the map and just to get item and money. AND THEY ARE MANDATORY if you really want to level up or buy stuff…which reminds me:

**GRINDING - FORGEIT! -- the game is really fix for u to be almost imposible to go further away of what u supposed to be. just forget about fighting for your EXP or money or items JUST GO AN TRY OUR NEW BORING SUB MISSIONS or why dont you try DLC and give them MORE MONEY!

***FIGHTING*****
The only upper hand are the characters, other than that:
Flashy, theatrical, pointless…. All games are rig, but this one doesn’t mind handing it!
Boost Attacks: are only when you’re about to kill the enemy other than that, the bar when it’s about to fill, if it’s not weak, it will disappear. so you guessed it! ALL BATTLES ENDS THE SAME WAY with a boost attack.
EXP drops exponentially: in other for not letting u grind EXP, you can move from 2000 EXP to just 200 EXP per fight.
Leveling up: Look I’m about the end of the game with the best weapons and upgrades and im still dealing punches of 60 Ponts to enemies with 60.000 HP, and they can randomly almost kill me with a single shoot. BTW im at the same level as the enemies and bosses
No strategy, all act the same, they get mad at the same point, call 2 times they Mystic attack and can kill you with a single shoot, a few of them are really challenging BUT REALLY CHALLENGING.
BOSSES: they decided to copy final fantasy: theatrical bosses and 2 or more together at the end.

***STORY****
One of the great points of the TALES series RUINED!
SPIOLER FREE: you will play 40 hours with an 80s RPG idea, then 5 final hours with the REAL PROBLEM. 
its like: OH! THE GAME ITS TOO LONG LETS SOLVE THE GAME QUICKLY IN THE FINAL HOURS AND LETS PUT SOME TWIST AT THE VERY END SO I WILL LOOK THAT WE TRY.
BTW2: i know that the stories tent to be silly BUT REALLY!!

IN THE END:

I never thought that TALES SERIES will fall into this NEW ERA of GRAPHICS OVER EVERYTHING!

Tales finally went sci-fi route but still retains some of the fantasy that it is known for, and balances it well. Some story are cheesy though, so grit your teeth when it comes. Plot macguffins exists as well, so that's something that leaves to be desired for.

It's a beautiful game with impressive effects, I definitely rate it very highly but it's not without its missteps.

PROS: ToA has gorgeous graphics, great sounds, interesting level and character design, fast-paced combat, and an interesting storyline about a subjugated people and their overseers that gets more complicated in its intrigue as you progress. Areas are fairly large but quick to traverse, and multiple systems, both in and out of combat, are introduced over time. AI party members are fairly competent, and you can toggle abilities on and off to suit your play style or specific encounters. Cooking buffs can affect a wide range of things, from stats to recovery to loot collection, and the game is generous towards what it DOESN'T count as time elapsed until the effects wear off. Accessory augmenting allows for min/maxing. Party members pair up in interesting ways in regards to motives and story. Skill usage is capped by recovery time, rather than an ability pool, except for healing, which I enjoy because it forces you to make tough decisions on resource usage. AI settings are a bit lacking, but sufficient (think of it like a lite version of FFXII's gambit system.) Combat is fast-paced and rewards clever skill choice for combo strings. No missables! And New Game+!

CONS: Limited enemy types makes combat feel a bit repetitive and samey, and your party member's boost abilities can only target the enemy you have locked on, which can make it difficult to quickly use ones on the right enemy that have a time window in which they are useful. Fairly tight camera in combat means it's easy to get hit by off-screen attacks you might otherwise have been able to dodge, and enemies hit hard. Weapons and armor are uninspired and little more than stat sticks. The game doesn't quite shove DLC down your throat, but it's there every time you camp. Some [non-essential] skills are locked behind costume DLC. Anime and JRPG  tropes get annoying from time to time. Number of skills (""artes"") is really more than necessary, and no solid feedback is given regarding their relative numeric strengths or effects of leveling them up. Regardless of input settings, accidentally using the same arte multiple times in a row is very easy. Control configuration is not intuitive, and (at least using an XBOX ONE controller) the game will only display keyboard prompts unless you plug the controller in after starting the game. Randomness in accessory crafting based on ore attributes is not really a problem, but you might need to do a lot of farming if you really do want to min/max. Difficult combat scenarios can dissolve into chaos very quickly.

In short, while it may seem like I have a laundry list of complaints, they don't detract significantly from this being a solid, very fun game.",1639265336,1639265336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a tales of fan, or at least I'm supposed to be, my favorite being tales of abyss. So what do I hate in tales of arise?     
....It's generic as fuck.    
I can't find any better way to say this. The story is simple and predictible. You can guess all the ""plot twist"" way before they are ever revealed. It gets pretty annoying at some point. Even if we forget that, the story just feel like a list of check box to tick off.    
The only good point is that the characters are good, but with a twist: they are ""looping"", for lack of better word. While each character do get a nice development for a time, after that, it seems like there is nothing more to say about them so instead the game keep on repeating the same thing again and again, repeating the exact same ""development"" again and again just in case the player forgot about it. At some point I'm just like ""the heck, didn't we have this scene 5 times already?"".       
The gameplay itself is pretty bad imo, for a few reasons.    
The ""open world"" feel very closed for some reason and is way too linear. Feels like a long time since I played such a linear ""open world"".   
The combat is bad because enemies are just a sack of HP you need to grind through, nothing more nothing less. Even random mob are so tanky it takes forever to kill, but the combat itself is fairly simple so it gets very boring at some point. I'm just gonna be hond and say that after 15 hour of this I just enabled cheat and just pushed through it avoiding as many random encounters as possible, which probably doesn't help with my enjoyment of the game.

I bought the standard edition. When I first read the store page I taught that Ultimate Edition only provides more Cosmetics and EXP booster.

I have been playing on hard difficulty for more rewards and my OCD tendencies usually made me grind quite a bit during the story. 

I have been enjoying the story, characters, and game play. Especially the game play, I enjoy trying to combo and the combat system seem to have the right difficulty/complexity for me. Not too complex. Challenging but not too mechanically challenging. I was thinking that I might become a new fan of this series.

Then I notice what I was missing because I didn't bought the ultimate edition and it kind of kill my motivation to finish the game. Especially, the Artes and Titles that are lock behind the DLCs.

I thinks that I could finish the game with just standard edition but I kind of lost the motivation because I feels that I would have a much better experience with the ultimate edition with more freedom in my game play.

I do not like the practice of locking artes and titles behind costumes DLCs but I was having so much fun that I considers to upgrade to Ultimate Edition. However, it seems like there is no way to upgrade.

If I want those Artes and titles I will have to buy the DLCs separately which seems to be a bad deal compared to buying the Ultimate Edition in the first place.

The price of all costume DLCs with Artes and Titles + The price of standard edition seems to be only a little bit lower than the price of Ultimate Edition but the Ultimate Edition offers a lot more benefits. Especially the artifact that helps with SP grind which from my experience is very slow.

The DLCs advertisement during camping feel especially bad after I know more about the DLCs. 

Right now I am not sure if I have enough motivation to finish the game so I can't really recommend this game. 
I might feel better about this game if the situation changes.

Edit: I am trying to progress through the story. 
Might change my mind if I am able to finished the game and the experience feel balance and good. 
I hope that the scarcity of in-game money and inventory limit in the game will feel like a good challenge rather than a pressure to buy DLCs.

First of all the game has 0 respect for your time. After grinding for around 5 hours just to beat a boss on NORMAL difficulty, I decided to just turn the difficulty down to Very Easy and just slide through the game. Looking at the fact that the DLC increases the EXP rate and CP gain rate by 2x, I see the reason pretty clear what happened.

I really wanted to like the game.

The story is fine, the pacing is fairly slow as it takes it's time to build up. The story is mostly good, with some very predictable Deus Ex machinas scattered about, and a fairly predictable message. The dialogue between characters starts out extremely good and then just becomes the same conversation over and over again. 

The character pairs all have decent chemistry and it is nice that this is increasingly explored as the game progresses.

The combat is mostly enjoyable aside from the fact that the game generally punishes you as much as possible. The Main DPS takes self damage in exchange for pumping up his own damage, for generally a single attack. This works fine when the attack hits, sometimes it doesn't because of very weird auto-tracking and an enemy moving at the last second. I'm okay with that conceptually just the fact that there is a healing gauge that replenishes either via resting (or throwing materials at it) just takes away from experimenting. I cleared up to the point where they start introducing the endgame+ dungeons on normal difficulty. I realized that in order to do said dungeons I would either have to grind for 12+ hours...or just stop caring and put it on Very Easy.

The pacing for the RPG elements is so bad I was generally under-leveled, on normal with typical grinding, by around 5 levels. In this game even minor statistic upgrades can have large charges, so level differences make or break quite a bit. As an example, I took on a quest boss that was level 46 at level 39. Any single mistake would get me immediately one shot. Facing the same boss again at level 45 I snoozed my way through it without much problem. I didn't have the personal motivation to grind for 5+ hours prior to each ""difficult"" boss fight just to equalize my levels.

The graphics are generally amazing and quite creative. The combat, along with the visuals, is what drew me to pull the trigger to get the game.

If I compare this game to something also fairly recent, like Scarlet Nexus, I find Scarlet Nexus to be the clear winner. There are still great graphics, good characters, an interesting story (though to be honest Scarlet Nexus is just a much better put together and thought out story), rpg elements, and strong combat. Scarlet Nexus makes the grinding not a chore, makes the fights not require a loading screen each time, respects your time (I felt too strong in Scarlet Nexus with a bit of grinding on higher difficulty).

I honestly wish that I could recommend this game. It has a lot of the elements that should make it good. They just don't come together at the right time, nor does it respect your time, and it also appears that the DLC is meant to be the bridge to play the game the way it would be intended.",1639107658,1639107658,False,5,2,0.493791043758392334,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise is a gorgeous game accompanied by an amazing soundtrack but is held back by so much it makes me not want to continue playing. The story is below average, at best, along with so many characters being one-note, lacking any depth, and some being downright boring and cliche make this go from an easy 8/10 to a 5/10. Not only are the characters bland, boring or shoe-horned, the world is very static, too, adding to the overall blandness the game exudes. During the game, the lords that rule each realm tyrannically rule their lands, but that threat of being attacked, jailed, or enslaved again are never there. I never feel as though I am under threat from any of the lords considering we are able to just waltz in and completely stir things up. This game throws so many cutscenes at the player its mind-numbing, and every scene is there to simply push the story along. No information that i would like to know more about is explained, characters act completely shady toward Alphen, and he just blindly trusts them, along with everyone else. Why is everyone so trusting when the game the entire time is trying to sell me on the notion that everyone is distrusting of one another when that is simply not the case. Overall, this game needed a proper play-test and rundown of the story before being released. Its a shame considering I pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition, which also lacked content that they are selling back to the consumer, some of which are essential to the game. This easily could have been an 8 or 9 out of 10 had they focused on the story, world-building and character arcs more so than the graphics. I'd like to say that they focused on gameplay elements, yet I cannot due to the fact so much time is spent watching a cutscene. If I wanted to watch a movie, I would have loaded up Netflix. I highly do not recommend the average person to go out and play this game, it has terrible characters, story, story pacing, world-building, and overall lack of gameplay drop this games score down to a 5/10. Its extremely average at best, and below average at worst. Pick up on-sale with a heavy discount since they seem more interested in adding paid costumes into the game instead of actually updating the many bugs and problems that persist in this game since my original review over two months ago. 

Edit: I was able to fix the problem with the controller bug, but other bugs still exist, like clipping and literal characters walking right through each other. Also, there are more graphics options than other JRPGS; however, the very limited graphics options, such as the lack of an FOV slider, can make certain parts of the game annoying. Why? Well, the pre-order costumes came with wings, and when they are equipped in certain parts of the game it completely blocks the entire screen, making it impossible to see. It wouldn't be a problem if you had a way to zoom out, but alas you do not. Furthermore, there seems to be times where the audio is out of synch with the lips. Overall the game has an amazing combat system, gorgeous graphics, and superb music, but the controller bug, as well as a litany of other bugs, makes this more of a cautionary review that leans towards being more negative than positive. 

So I'd love to play the game but there is a major controller bug at the moment which kills the game for many. Terrible start to a game. I found that if I pressed the Xbox Button on the controller it would allow me to use the cursor as if I was using a mouse. So it is all bugged tf out.

I'm never sure with these ratings if I'm supposed to rate my subjective enjoyment or the objective quality of the product.  Because asides from better graphics, Tales of Arise is objectively just more of the same, but I subjectively still love it.  

Bandai Namco, the studio behind the Tales series, was and still is keenly aware that the Tales series is aging after 25 years of reiterating the same game: Action JRPG with anime aesthetic.  That's why the studio put the series on hiatus after 2016's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/429660/Tales_of_Berseria]Tales of Beseria[/url], which itself was meant to be a sendoff after the series' 20th anniversary.  But the strong sales of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/738540/Tales_of_Vesperia_Definitive_Edition]the remastered Tales of Vesperia Definitive Edition[/url] prompted the studio to take one more crack at it.

Tales of Arise was supposed to revitalize and evolve the series.  However, the only major ""evolution"" here is the graphics, which look amazing thanks to a new engine running on Unreal 4.  A new coat of paint doesn't disguise that everything else, like gameplay and story, is the same as what we've seen from the series over the past 20 years.  So objectively the game fails at ""evolving"" the aging series.  

But personally, I'm fine with that.  I've enjoyed previous Tales games, and Tales of Arise is more of what I like.  Perhaps I'm biased by the fact that the majority of the Tales games have only recently been released on PC and Steam, so it's still new to me.  Even if it doesn't evolve the series, it still showcases with it's enhanced graphics the best of what made past Tales games so great and memorable.",1639072617,1639072617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I've played most modern JRPGs on steam, where modern means 3d and voice acted. I've played every tales title on steam and this game was a chore to play.

Most of the reviews for the game are positive, because the game has higher production values than previous entries and its the first Tales entry that leans away from the Shonen Anime Cliche that Tales is normally known for. In many ways the game feels like if Square Enix (Final Fantasy) tried to make a Tales game. The game skews more serious, less cliche, and has higher production values, and ought to have been the best game in the franchise. However, I found that  I enjoyed this game considerably less than Vesperia, Berseria and Symphonia. 

This game has  three main problems that largely detract from this over all experience and make it a slog to get to. 

1. The game is grindy and the battle system is very difficult to understand. While it shares elements with most Tales games in the sense it features battle game like mechanics, however special moves, over limits etc. are difficult to execute and the combat is largely not fun.  Add to this that battles are frequent and often unavoidable, this makes majority of the game play a slog. 

2. The story is flawed and has pacing issues, especially in the middle/end. The game is split into two parts, where the first half is a tournament quest and the 2nd half is defeat the demon king. The first half does a good job of fleshing out the world, it does not do a good job setting up the mysteries of the 2nd half. The result is that 2nd half has to setup the mystery of the world and  the story feels rushed. This becomes obvious when typical tales games skits occur consecutively (often being grouped three together)

3. The characters are not compelling, especially the main villains of the story. They lack depth that many JRPG villains have and largely seem like they are there to be there. I also find that the main cast are quite annoying and the script is generally a bit too sappy/angsty even by JRPG standards. 

To sum up : Tales is a relatively high production JRPG, with a mediocre story and pacing problems. If your a die hard tales fan, this game might still be worth playing. Its by no means the worst JRPG on steam. That being said its hard to put it on the same level as tales of berseria, tales of symphonia or any of the main line final fantasy series (including 13/15).

This was my first Tales game and it was a lot of fun. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
The combat was fun and didn't get old for me.  There are a lot of different and diverse mechanics with which to experiment.  The story was engaging and I was invested in the relationships among the characters.  Additionally there was a decent amount of post game content.

[h1]Meh[/h1]
The DLC practices aren't great, but they weren't as intrusive as I thought they'd be based on reading other reviews.  When you are at camp there is a menu option you can select to look at DLC, but that's about as bad as it gets.  It didn't ruin the immersion for me.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
My biggest critique is that there is too much dialogue towards the end of the game.  It wouldn't be so bad, but the characters kept rehashing the same things over and over again.  The dialogue can also be too corny at times.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
In the overall is was a great game and I even took the time to get every achievement.  Looking forward to playing more Tales games in the future.",1639018775,1639018883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Cons :
-The CP system. It is basically TP or MP but field actions eat the resource as well. This is more a annoyance than a game feature and the previous 2 Tales games did away with this. It just makes selecting harder difficulties a grind because you want to take down this pillar of fire but it eats the thing that you use to heal which forces you into a kill stuff -> camp site to sleep/eat repeat cycle.
-Lack of item drops and gald on enemies to keep one from being forced to do the side quests
-Difficulty settings seem less about difficulty and more about if you want the enemies to be HP sponges.
-Some particular cutscenes and the overall story could have used a little work to make some things less well cringe.
-The music is not as good as Tales of Zestiria's soundtrack because no Go Shiina.
-No CO-OP... the AI is still as dumb as a box of rocks.
-This is a Tales game where the Tales are optional... a lot of the character development is in the skits.... the same ones that can be missed if you do not say... go fishing with a particular character. For me this leaves it feeling slightly odd if you did not gain affinity with said character and something major happens in the main story that relies on previous optional banner to feel more authentic.

The Pros :
-A actual graphics uplift. The series finally shed the PS3 look that has been present since Tales of Xillia.
-Has a great team based combat system where each character has a particular reaction to enemy attacks. 
-Backtracking kept to a minimal and there is a way point system (yes I remember that time Berseria made me jump on ships multiple times to go to the same landmass I was already on.
-They fixed that thing in Berseria where you could cheese the game with devour.... The main character equal here will cost you something in exchange making it not good for abuse.

WARNING : Do not play this on the hardest difficult unless you plan to do all the side content as mentioned above you get like nothing but EXP for killing mobs... none of those meme worthy apple gel treasure chests are on the normal path.... and money only seems to come from bosses and side content.

Playing Tales of Arise reminds me of how I felt playing Final Fantasy 10 and 12 as a kid, which were 2 of my all time favorite games. However Tales of Arise has all the quality of life improvements of modern games plus a more open feeling world and a more engaging combat system while still hitting that nostalgic feeling of the FF series at, where I personally thought, was its best.

The story comes at you pretty fast with not much filler, there are both paced out cut scenes and also little comic strip style snippets that pop up while traveling (voluntary to read). Tales of Arise so far has done a really good job with pacing and with making you feel like you're getting to know both the world and the people you're meeting.
The voice acting is superb, the art style is beautiful, the combat is fun, there are customization options (can equip different outfit/weapon skins of your choosing plus some accessories once you start rescuing certain critters ^^).

If you're interested in story lines, lots of dialogue, and a large amount of exposition -- this game is for you. You will be hit with cut scene after cut scene. Walk 5 feet? Cut scene. Rest at a campfire? Cut scene. And if the forced cut scenes weren't enough, there are optional cutscenes sprinkled liberally over every map. Not enough for you? You can also choose to boost your relationship with other party members at a campfire by engaging in....you guessed it; more cutscenes. 
With so much backstory and character engagement, you would think this game has a ton of depth. And you'd be wrong. If you've ever played any other JRPG, you already know the basic format. Dense archetypal hero with a big sword meets angsty embittered teen girl with a revealing dress. 

But as far as the formula goes, Arise does it fairly well. Cutscenes, despite how excessive they are, are done well. The artwork is beautiful for the most part, and so is the voice acting and musical score. Combat flows well, with each character performing a variety of combination moves that they learn throughout the game. A variety of different skill trees and character bonuses are unlocked for each character as you progress through the storyline. You can spec into them by using skill points which are gathered both from combat and quests/tasks. 

Tales is a largely linear game. While you can go back to prior areas, there isn't much reason to do so. It is not very grindy, but you can also not over-level. Enemies are a static level for each area, and you will reach the level the game wants you to be by the time you clear an area.

As an avid fan of RPGs, I've played many through the years along with my fair share of Tales games.  However, I've watched as the franchise has steadily declined over the last few entries and i proceeded into this one with caution. Having said that, Tales of Arise is a significant return to form, but there are some issues that I'd like to address.

Gameplay 9/10

This area is an improvement in every form, and it is without a doubt my favorite combat system that Tales has ever created. The battles in this game are fast, combo-oriented, and extremely satisfying. Enemies can be a little spongy, and battles can take a long time, especially boss battles later in the game, but they are so fun and rewarding that in my 65+ hours with the game i never grew tired of them.

One notable addition is a clever combo system called ""Boost Strikes,"" which allows you to pull off what are essentially one-hit kill combo attacks with another party member, but the catch is that you must have built up quite a hefty combo on the opponent without being hit, and keeping them stun-locked throughout. As the game progresses and the player becomes more acquainted with combat, these moves become easier to execute, resulting in a very rewarding mechanic within the battles and MY GOD are they gorgeous to look at.

There are a variety of other side hobbies you might pursue to add to your gaming drive, but the majority are simple and quick to complete. The level of exploration here is one significant change. Tales of Arise is still a linear game, but there are plenty of big locations to explore and hidden surprises to discover. It helps that this is the series' most beautiful game, and probably one of the best-looking games of all time. It comes down to whether you like the graphics style or not, but some of the landscapes in this game are so magnificent that I found myself revisiting particular places just to soak in the scenery.

Story - 8/10

This is where I have the majority of my troubles with the game. Now before I have an angry mob chase me down with pitchforks, let me explain : I enjoyed the story and had an amazing time with the characters and even ended up loving them, but there were a few issues that hindered this journey from climbing the pantheon of some of my favorite stories/characters in the franchise (Vesperia, Symphonia, Xillia). I'll break it down into two sections: one regarding the main plot, and another about the characters.

This game's plot is actually extremely engaging, and it kept me interested until approximately the last quarter of the game. It felt as if the game became so engrossed in its message that it lost focus and became a little weird at the finish. One game I can compare this to is Persona 5. AND I LOVE THAT GAME! However, some RPGS tend to do this a lot by have a strong story then just letting it become a bit goofy and out of left field.

It took me a long time to figure out why this cast of characters didn't exactly connect with me at first, but after many hours with them, I believe I've finally cracked the code. This game has a plot that is, to be honest, a little dark and deals with some important issues. Because of this, I believe this cast lacks the same level of ""fun"" as prior casts. Though I did end up loving them in the end and had a ton of laugh out loud moments. I think back at other games like Berseria, which had a serious plot as well.... but was able to generate some funny, laugh-out-loud moments that strengthened the cast's bond.

There are instances like that in the game as I said, but they are mostly in optional skits and not in the main story dialogue. There are many moments of over-emotional reactions to things that felt very out of place, many characters apologizing for saying or asking something that didn't need an apology, and just some generally awkward dialogue, whether it's due to the script, over-acting, direction given to the actors, or a combination of all three.

As a long-time fan of the JRPG genre, I'm used to bad dialogue, but the Tales series has done much better in the past, so it felt like a step back in that aspect. While most of the bosses were pretty badass (LOVED THE BOSS FIGHTS IN THIS GAME!) It also doesn't help that the main villain is really weak and underdeveloped, which is disappointing coming from a franchise that has previously created some excellent villains. I haven't felt that since Necron in Final Fantasy IX. 

On a more positive side, I liked how this game handled the themes it picked, and I think it's a very refreshing break from what they've done before; it felt fresh and intriguing (until around the last quarter), and several of the characters are standouts.

Graphics & Sound - 9/10

I don't have anything to add to what I've already said. The environments are wonderful, and I say that as someone who has played a lot of video games (My profile is proof and thats only 1/30th of what i have). The character models are extremely detailed, and the fighting animations are both rewarding and enjoyable to watch repeatedly.

The soundtrack is excellent (Always let the intro play when i started) and enhances the experience, but the voice acting, although pretty decent, felt a bit over-acted at times,

Overall - 8.6/10

Tales of Arise is a fantastic new installment in the series, and it's a huge step forward after a string of duds. I believe that a few steps back were done in terms of plot, but given how many steps forward were achieved in terms of gameplay and graphics, I consider this to be one of the better entries. 

Should you buy it? YES!!! TOTALLY!!!

With that being said, it certainly isn't the best ""tales of"" game out there, and for the most part it felt very streamed lined. It's much more linear than previous ""Tales of"" games and a lot easier to 100% (which I was able to do in roughly 100 hours playing on normal). For those not interested in doing a 100% run, and depending on the difficulty level you play on and how many side quests you are willing to do, the game will be about 40-80 hours long to complete. I had a lot of fun overall and I think it's well worth the money. But the game is very much a one off experience. I had zero desire to do a playthrough plus seeing as how everything can be achieved in one go. 

The combat is really addictive and overall easier to master than previous ""Tales of"" games. Also visually the game is quite nice and has a very unique style to it which I loved. The only thing that bothered me were the occasional texture pop-ins. It seems strange that a modern day game would still have that sort of thing in it. It clearly wasn't optimised for PCs and feels more like a direct port from consoles. There's no 21:9 aspect ratio support either. But none of this bothered me or ruined my experience.

The pacing of the story telling I felt was the weakest part of the game. All the cutscenes and skits felt like they dragged on way too much. The cinematic cutscenes however were awesome and I wish there had been more. The story was typical but not uncommon for a JRPG and overall I enjoyed it. But the pacing, dear god! It felt like they crammed 50% of the story cutscenes and skits near the end of the game which really killed the momentum for me. 

Overall I recommend the game because you'll get your money's worth out of it. But I really hope this isn't the direction the series takes in the future. Bring back the hardcore grindy end game content with reasons to want to do a playthough+ for us nerds who like challenging (but doable) 100% achievements.

The Good

- The Visiuals are beautiful to look at. The world has a cell shaded look to them similar to the Borderlands series, and the characters main weapon, The Blazing Sword, has amazing fire effects.

The Bad


-Story is full of tropes and easily predictable (I played up until the 2nd lord and succesfully predicted every major plot point so far.) 
-World is unrewarding to explore, aside from a small amount of chests, containing items easily obtained elsewhere, small amounts of gold, or armor sets marginally better than crafted sets and do not change how your character looks. 
-Combat is unexciting. It consists of pressing the same button combinations over and over again. You unlock different combat skills frequently as you play, but every skill feels unexciting. They switch up the animation your character performs but all of the normal combat skills (besides the flashy ""do a shit load of damage cause your the main character"" skills) do 1 of 4 things;
1. Hit the enemy 1-5 times, doing a small amount of damage. These purely serve to chain into other combat skills
2. Hit the enemy 1-5 times and launch them to the air, dealing a small amount of damage. These purely serve to chain into your aeriel combat skills.
3. Only activatable in midair: See 1.
4. Only activatable in midair: Hits the enemy 1-5 times, then one final hit while throwing yourself back to the ground. These actually dont chain very well with other skills, because A. You spent your limited but quickly recharging combat points that every skill requires, or B. The attack delay after you land is too long to continue your combo.
Repeat ad nauseum, because that's how you beat every encounter. 
-The music is very forgettable. It servers it's purpose pretty decently during gameplay but after 13 hours (and hearing the same battle song the whole time in classic JRPG fashion, I can't remember a single song. 


Skip this one. There are better RPG's.

The Bad: You're going to be poor ALL THROUGHOUT THIS GAME unless you decide to grind it out for materialls to sell even then EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!  I dealt with this until the end of the game where I had enough and just used cheat engine to get money to make it more managble. 
Bosses: They're really hard, kinda like Vesperia where you will die several times, get frustrated and want to take breaks yet the enemys are fun to beat on hard mode yet not worth the exp.
 Cosmetics and fishing: Their isn't a lot of interesting cosmetics really except some head gear which is ehhhh. Fishing is just garbage yet certain recipes are requipred for you  to fish, passable though.
Lastly the Camera in combat is wonky and takes some getting used to along with the button format which I got used to it.
The Good: Story is more dark and interesting, the characters aren't all buddy buddy in the begining and you get to see them all show rheir human sides as well as grow attached (100ish) hours later.  The combat is very fun and fluid and the finishers always look cool and are easy to use.  It's a very visually appealing game and holds up to the 2021 games, THE CHARACTERS TALK A LOT so that's a hit or miss depending on your patience.  CP is a new system for healing in this game magic wise it takes points to heal though its free to use elemental attacks/spells.   Its alright, after 100 hours in and finally done I can say it was fun but BOY.

I will echo some others and just say the dialog, characters and story feel like they were all written by an 8 year old. This is so cringe-worthy during character dialog it just amazes me that this is the new bar for so many people. It makes me sad we have come this far to call THIS an ""amazing jrpg""  and worries me about the future quality of gaming in general.

Characters are completely one dimensional with typical tropes and have ZERO soul to them, they are just one dimensional puppets and the terrible voice acting doesn't help (English voice work is baaaaaad). The character development and dialog is so poor I didn't give two craps about any single one of them or what our goal was ultimately. 

I also hate the CP system (to heal or do random crap around the maps) which seems like you never really have enough at times. Obviously made that way on purpose (cant buy items to recover it in game lol) in hopes that it might be just annoying enough to maybe make some customers look at their greedy ass corporate store where you can buy stuff to restore it lol.

I also hate how most of the outfits you have to buy in the store or get with the collectors edition. That was again...on purpose. I can imagine how this went down in the board room ""Hey Bob I got a great idea how to screw over the customers buying our game and make us more money! How about instead of doing unique artwork for each piece of armor we just skip all that crap and make 'outfits' and we will only make a few they can get in game but then put a ton in the store to make more money"".   This is not a HUGE deal, its just annoying (and boring because while you are changing loot constantly your characters look doesn't change at all) and obviously done to make more money when the game would have been much better to have artwork for pieces of gear AND outfits for transmogrify if you wanted but no....they had to go the corporate greed route....well done BANDAI. Seems to be the norm now days.

The music was completely forgettable.  I wish I could mute the opening song from ever playing again, it just doesn't fit the game at all to me and is loud and annoying.

The combat while really cool at first gets so incredibly repetitive and sometimes really long that I started to avoid encounters altogether. The combat just feels sloppy as well. its flashy no doubt, but repetitive and sloppy. 

I just cant believe the reviews on this, in all my 30 years of gaming I would give this game a solid 5-6 out of 10. I feel like people are starving so much for an RPG the bar has just gotten so low. I would definitely say I regret purchasing this game and I usually love RPGs.

If you are an anime fan and can stand/enjoy the one dimensional characters and story and typical tropes, you might enjoy this. If you are an middle aged gamer like myself you will roll your eyes every five minutes at how ridiculous everything is.",1631768119,1638593687,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and most of the dialogue between the characters is so cringe that you might find yourself falling out of the back of the chair from rolling your eyes so hard, or you might find yourself dry heaving, it's a coin toss really.

The characters are completely generic one-trick ponies and I'd put money on the fact that the story was pulled from the backpack of some 6th grade weebo.

There's a lot of poor and stupidly written moments in the story (so far), and I dont even think I'm going to be able to drag myself through the rest of this game - already found myself dropping the difficulty of combat to the minimum difficulty just to make this train get to the station faster, and even then I might actually eat a handful of broken glass before we get there:

BASIC CHARACTERS:
None of the characters are interesting...
Main male character is generic hero that wants to save everyone because it's justice!
Main female character doesnt need no friends because she doesnt need anyone, but 'deep down she really needs you' - too bad she wasnt ALSO in another castle because I'm already tired of dragging her along.

DUMB STORY:
- You meet a couple of your party members along the story and have to fight them, then they join you which wouldnt be a big deal if done better, BUT one of them you have to fight because ""He's so mad he cant control himself"".  Then his aid is just 'so disappointed in him' that she she cries and ""Cant bare to look at him, and never wants to see him again"", but one cut scene later - we all dance off down the yellow brick road together to see the wizard...
- One of the characters gets revenge for someone killing someone close to him, but then doesnt let a different character do the same thing (two-ish story chapters later) because ""He couldnt stand the look in her eyes when she was about to kill"" - who writes this garbage? We, as a party, are LITERALLY on a grand quest to (get this), KILL ALL THE LORDS and steal their dragon balls (AND PS: We've already killed two of them).
- There's easily 100x more dumb things said in the dialogue/plot, but I'll let you suffer through that on your own if you still decide to purchase this.

BORING COMBAT:
It's just button mashing wrapped in some pretty wallpaper.  Even on the easiest difficulty everything has a ton of hit points.

- I do like that each party member has something to contribute to combat, but the enemies are often too many for it to matter.  For example, one character can interrupt spells, but you're often in a fight with 3-4 enemies that will cast near the same time.  A different character can stop enemies from bull-charging, but (like with the casting) you'll have multiple enemies doing charging attacks quite regularly, and the cooldowns for your characters' moves are much longer than that so it's kinda pointless.
- For all the button mashing and freedom of movement in combat, the only thing that actually feels skill based is your ability to timely dodge enemy attacks, but it doesnt even open enemies up for a big enough counter punish, so you might as well just keep mashing the attack buttons and get it over with faster.

So yeah,
If you're looking for good combat: It's not here.
If you're looking for a good story: It's not here.
If you're looking for good characters: It's not here.

One thing that the game does do well is allow you to change the way your party members look, but that alone doesnt make the game worth the purchase.",1638574525,1638574775,False,25,4,0.553373754024505615,1,True,False,False

 About 30 hours into the game however, it becomes painfully obvious that they had to cram another 20 hours of story into 5 hours of exposition dump (3 hours of which the characters literally stand around as the remaining details of the plot are explained to them). I was having a great time up until that point but part of the fun of the story is anticipating how it will unfold and having everything come to a screaming halt for a 5 hour info dump retroactively ruined the rest of it for me.

The fighting system is not that bad and gets a little addictive, tho there is allmost no strategy needed seeing that all you need to win is to be a high enough lvl compared to your opponents. 
In general the game is completely linear and gives little to no room for choosing your own path or developing characters in different ways. They have an option to create amulets and modify these, tho once you get enough materials to really do this properly the game is allmost over and I didnt really feel that it was needed in any way.

Now, what can I say about Arise?

Story
It's not that good as it may seem. Let me correct myself, It's not that good for a TALES game. A typical MC with a goal of saving everyone from the oppression of another race and then at the end making everyone happy happy. We see that in many games and movies nowadays and it's pretty sad to see how it touched Arise. Tales games always had a unique story that would make you want to know what will happen next. 80% of the game you are clearing locations from lords. At first, it's somewhat interesting but the further you go the more you see how the developers didn't know what to make, so they just rushed the final lords and then slowed the game to a snail pace. Developers decided that it would be a great idea to artificially delay the plot and make you walk through long long long dungeons, getting a cutscene and then going back to the beginning with the enemies respawned. I would understand if there were scenes or dialogs, but it's just a run back in silence. The ending wasn't so unique or new. Cliche ""Oh great power gives me strength to save the one I love and everyone else"" is getting pretty annoying and that is not what a Tales game should have. 

Side Quests
At first, I thought that just killing monsters and grinding some materials for the quest will be in the beginning but no, 98% of sidequests are 1)Go kill x number of monsters 2)Bring me x number of x materials. There are a few side quests that are not like 1 and 2 but they are very uninteresting. If we had multi-level sidequests that could even be missed in previous games, here we have boring quests from MMO for casual players 

Skits
The decision to make skits look like in Scarlet Nexus and make them animated was not the best decision. Not just because they look very strange and clunky but it's slightly starting to get irritating to look at these cycled animations over and over in all skits. It wouldn't be so bad if they remained the good old 2d animated style. It was getting you out from the game and letting you have a little relaxation while listening to these skits. Here it's just...No

Characters
I can't really say that they will stick with you for a long time. The main characters aren't something unique (Yes, I used the word unique already 3 times) and are pretty blank. Their decisions and dialogs are pretty strange and sometimes unlogical. Sometimes even annoying. Villains? What villains? There is no such thing in Arise. Only blank, uninteresting, unmemorable, without any history, motivation, or global goal Lords that are nothing compared to the Villains we had in previous Tales games. Even a god damn bandit in Berseria has a more interesting quest than all of the lords in Arise.

Graphics
Here I have no problems at all, it does look very nice with the effects and particles. Character models and the locations do look very good and that is a big improvement.

Gameplay
We still have locations that are now purely linear and if there are buffer locations, they are uninteresting at all. Locations are not interesting to explore as there is nothing to explore. Few chests, Stones for crafting, food, and stat increase plants and tons of enemies. The only thing that you can enjoy, are cities as they are looking very nice
Fishing, Farm for food, and a training ground in Mencia. Only one mini-game (Fishing) and that is all, No puzzles and very clunky world interaction for which they created separate cutscenes 

Combat
It got slower if we compare to Berseria and if you are not careful, you will pay the price. You should learn to manage your team and manage the equipment. Artes are also very important and should not be forgotten about. The only thing that got me irritated is that you can't see enemy weakness in battle. You can check it while not in combat in the Enemy Book but not when you are already in the process. I also do not understand the decision to make character subtitles to the left when in Combat. How am I supposed to read what they are saying (Japanese Voice) and keep fighting, evading, and performing combos at the same time? If it was at the lower center, you could at least have a full view of the battle and dialogs but in the logic of the devs, you must look at the subs with your left eye and fight with the right one.

Enemies
Developers were so lazy that they created a limited amount of enemies and just did a copy-paste by just changing the elements to them. Let me remind you that Arise has a much bigger budget than Berseria but has this tiny variety of enemies. Pure disappointment

Overall
I have very mixed feelings about Arise. I don't understand how the devs fell to this level after Berseria. If all of this downgrade in Story and side quests was to get a new audience then it surely did work but it is not something that the Tales series must fall into. The main thing in Tales games is the Story, Side Quests, and Characters and if those 3 aspects will remain as to how they are in Arise, then this series future is grim.

It is really hard for me to put a negative review on this game but putting a blind eye is worse and I think that many Tales fans will support me. I hope that Bandai will rethink the story in the next Tales game should be and we will see something either on the same level as Berseria or better.",1638487727,1638487727,False,4,1,0.516352295875549316,1,True,False,False

I'm not the biggest Tales fan that knows every game in and out, but so far the cast of Arise has been phenomenal. I've loved every character so far while I can't say that for the other Tales games I've played.

Berseria used to be my favorite Tales game, but this, at least right now, blows it out of the water. It certainly helps that this story doesn't feel like the usual JRPG kind of story. I don't really know how to describe it.",1638060428,1638440459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start off with explaining that I am a fan of the Tales of series and was looking forward to this game since it was announced... and was very pleased with the result. The game is very true to it's namesake and feels familiar to returning fans as well as a very welcoming experience for any players new to the series. Combat picks up quickly, is fast paced, and has potential for big flashy combos with cinematic finishers. Each character has their own unique style and role in combat and are all fun to control. The story is a bit intense, almost too dark at times, and compels you to emphasize with the struggles of the cast as they contest the current state of their world. The game has decently tough optional fights, a good number of side quests, and even a fun little fishing mini-game. Overall this game was well worth the wait, however it isn't without it's faults.

Although combat is fun and fluid, at times it can be a bit frustrating to be forced into the cinematic finishers/attacks vs elite monsters and bosses. As you approach the late game you've seen all of them more than a few dozen times and it interrupts the flow and resets the field.

The pacing of the game slows quite a bit as you are nearing the back end of the game and a lot of time is spent watching narrative/exposition as the story takes a major twist and there is a lot of information that needs to be passed to the player in a relatively short amount of time.

Aside from a few other nit-picky grievances these are the main issues that I found. 

Overall the game is well polished and I was quite impressed with the result. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a single-player experience. This game tells a beautiful story and backs it up with engaging game-play and visuals. It was well worth the wait and I will be patiently awaiting the next installment in the series.",1638387508,1638387508,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Main characters are poor copies of Zestiria's and Berseria's main characters, while the rest of the party members loses their nuances after their character arcs ended. Two in particular are especially bad.

Gameplay's fine but gets super repetitive quick, especially when the last dungeon goes on for wayyy too long than needed. The character banter during combat are a new addition to the series but it gets super old a few hours in, begging an option to turn them off.

-Lots of systems locked behind story progression, don't bother grinding/farming until later

It is my favorite not Strategy JRPG series bar none.   I held off a bit on Arise largely due to being sick a lot lately and not feeling well enough to play much.   However with the holiday sale I decided to go ahead and pick it up.   Today I was just going to spend a few minutes giving it a test run, but before I knew it three hours had past.

Bandai Namco outdid themselves on this latest installment of the series.  The story is great, the animations are great, the fighting is great, the voice acting is pretty good as well.  I didn't even have to turn the background music all the way down like I usually do as it was fairly good.

All in all the game is a great game if you like JRPGs that are have combat action involved.  Don't let all the DLC scare you away you don't have to have a bit of it to enough the game.  There are some costumes that you might want to pick up, but honestly everything is mostly fluff.   As far as the Pay-To-Win crowd. It's a single player crowd, so if someone wants to spend a few bucks for some DLC package that gives them a boost to GALD earned or SP earned, oh my, lol.

TL;DR - terrible story even by trope filled anime standards - good combat, if you're ok with a long JRPG with a bad story/writing then go ahead and grab it.

The bad: 
The story is a mess, it's so cliche and predictable that I can't help but cringe during most of the main story scenes. Many key plot points seem good but fail if you think about them for a few seconds or had the camera zoomed out (smokebomb allowing people to escape a half encirclement in an open area...? just one of many).

Additionally there is a large disconnect between character power and perceived power - fight an easy battle against 2-3 enemies in 10 seconds just to get a cutscene where you're overwhelmed by a whole 3 more enemies... really? Initially wrote this off as ""first 6 hours were a tutorial so whatever I guess"" but it just keeps happening :/

Large disconnect between story relationships/attitude and the skit attitudes which is jarring. You'll have characters being friendly in one interaciton set at a specific point then a story cutscene where they're behaving totally different to each other.  It's not like they're triggering out of order either, some are set to be played right outside certain story checkpoints which are then played right after.

Story pacing - game rockets to a 11 in terms of scale then just kinda... deflates. Tutorial starts with beating up mech suit wearing guys when you're at your weakest and you build up to fighting some guys in ski jackets who are way more threatening for some reason? Bad guys seem to be omnipotent and know stuff they shouldn't have had any access to or even makes sense - I DID EVERYTHING TO DRAW YOU HERE *main characters walk away* OH WELL!

To be clear, I'm cool with anime bullshit - loved Code Vein and most of the other Tales games are all good enough, this one is just exceptionally poor in terms of writing.

Also all the launch DLC is expensive and largely useless, feels bad to see banners ingame about it too.


WITH ALL THAT SAID, THE GOOD IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT LITTLE IS LEFT
Combat feels good, better than Berseria and pretty close to Vesperia levels. I prefer TP from older games but I guess the majority of people must prefer this if they stuck to it.

Kinda funny how just running around grinding or killing stuff is fun and what keeps me playing while all the story and plot is half finished unplanned garbage and makes me want to drop the game, ah well.

About 14h in and honestly can't see things changing much, unless I misunderstood and this is like FF13 where the first 40 hours being trash is ok because it's the ""tutorial"" - ahaha. Dunno about other people but 14h of bad writing is not ok, tutorial or not.

I'll come back and update if it needs it",1631989940,1638283203,False,6,0,0.438927352428436279,0,True,False,False

-The combat is generally fun

-There are only a small amount of enemy types
-Bosses can't be staggered so you need to play more defensively compared to previous entries

Bad -
-The game feels rushed and feels like some of the areas are padded to keep you playing longer. I started Part Two and the first dungeon that it sends you to is full of high HP monster that are boring to fight. Once you get through the dungeon no plot points are resolved and the game makes you walk all the way back to the beginning, fighting the same monsters again. I can't think of a reason why they'd make you walk back other than padding. 
-The second part of the story is poorly constructed. In Part One you are given a mission and you set out to do it. It's clear that there's more going on with the story than the first part however larger villains are barely foreshadowed and Part Two starts dumping large amounts of exposition on you.

It is beautiful though, the graphical improvements and style are all positives. I've 100% a number of the Tales games before but I've missed out on the last two entries.

The story handles some darker subject matter and focuses more on mysteries, and it has some good plot twists nestled in there. However, the game is pretty hamfisted while simultaneously not providing enough detail in many areas, and nearing the end is a massive exposition dump that upends most of the game over the course of about an hour. The overarching plot is good, but executed poorly nearing its most important parts. A small note: the skits in this game are really poorly paced out and often dropped in trios, and the subtitles have a noticeable amount of typos and errors.

The changes to combat are more or less excellent. It's easier to combo together attacks and artes, and artes themselves are more accessible with the lack of ""SP"" or a similar resource. The same cannot be said of healing magic, which has a very limited pool that requires you to rest often in order to not become an annoyance. It is always quickly depleted in boss fights unless you can wrangle the AI a certain way. It feels like every boss is more or less just a test of how many healing items you have.

Most of the game is designed like a mediocre dungeon: a hallway with a bunch of rooms filled with enemies, occasionally having a chest, and you fight a miniboss towards the end.

About halfway through is where everything hits the fan: I realized at around that time that the game only has roughly a dozen common enemy types that are recycled, and they became increasingly spongy. Bosses have some variety, but their HP is so comically massive that you will spend upwards of 10 minutes chipping away at them while the threat of being 1 or 2 shot looms and you have very limited healing resources. Minibosses fall prey to the same issues of both, and offer none of the strengths.

All of this is palatable at first, but each of these issues becomes increasingly prevalent towards the end of the game, where it becomes almost insufferable. I almost dropped this game because the last area is so horribly designed and everything takes so long to fight. Bosses are the apex of this issue, being simultaneously too hard-hitting and having FAR too much health. The only reason I didn't drop this was because I switched to ""very easy"" to save time on the HP inflated cannon fodder it shovels at you. As fun as the combat might be, it gets REALLY stale after you do the same thing for upwards of an hour against the same enemies you've been fighting the whole time. It feels like they left out some critical combo-based damage increase or something. It feels like it's not working.

I cannot recommend this as a game, it is excruciating. I started off liking this but having beaten it I don't believe I'll ever touch it again.

EDIT: Having played Zesteria and Berseria, this is mostly an improvement upon those games. Certainly in terms of combat, but the boss and HP issues dominate that sphere. It's nice to see that the skills and artes are somewhat simplified but it doesn't change the fact that it has critical design errors.",1635896169,1638232306,False,5,0,0.473432540893554688,0,True,False,False

In a long story short: this game is great. If you can handle some mildly tropey, campy aspects of anime-style storytelling, I recommend just jumping right into Tales of Arise. As someone who rarely dabbles in JRPGs or anime in general, this was a delightful treat. The characters have vibrant personalities albeit with some tropey aspects to them; the plot is well written and thoroughly thought out; there is clearly a passion behind some of the surprisingly deep themes in the story (there is a message in this game); the art direction is stellar; the world design is breathtaking; and the combat is fun. What more needs to be said? Play it. And that's coming from a person who doesn't really play JRPGs. Just do it, you won't regret it. 

Now, in this next section, I'll delve slightly deeper into some specific aspects of the game spoiler free. I'll try to keep it as succinct as possible. 

[h1]The Plot/Characters[/h1]

You play as ""Iron Mask"", a masked, amnesiac Dahnan slave living under the tyrannical rule of the Renans, powerful wielders of a mystical force known as astral energy, on the subjugated planet of Dahna. By a stroke of fate, Iron Mask bumps into a Renan outcast known as Shionne, a girl cursed by a mysterious force that causes harm to any who touch her. Surprised that Iron Mask is immune to her curse, Shionne finds that only he is capable of wielding her flaming sword, a product of the astral energy housed within her master core, a receptacle for vast amounts of the astral energy that is being harvested from Dahna. Creating a pact, Iron Mask and Shionne set out on an adventure to defeat all five of the Renan lords ruling over Dahna, obtain the remaining four master cores, and put an end to the crown contest being hosted on Dahna by the Renans once and for all. 

The game leads you through to each of the five main realms of Dahna, each a host to its own astral energy, lords, biomes, and peoples. On the way, Shionne and Iron Mask encounter a colorful cast of companions during their travels, each bringing their own strengths but also problems into the party. Each character has their own thoughts and feelings, making each character feel alive in their own way. Each region poses a new challenge for the unlikely companions, forcing each character to confront not only their own troubles but also the troubles of their world. 

While not exactly a drama, the series tackles several deep themes within the confines of the twin worlds, each realm within tackling different aspects of the very real problems of classism and elitism. Because of the nature of their journey, the main characters are forced to come face to face with their own prejudices, learning how to overcome such obstacles. All the while, the group is confronted with concepts of forgiveness, love, loneliness, openness, and meaning that's present or isn't in their lives. In short, Tales of Arise is a passionately written, mostly heartwarming and wholesome story about the overcoming of prejudice in a world of very different peoples and the importance of coming together in an understanding of one another as best they can.

[h1] The World [/h1]

As I stated before, Tales of Arise takes place on the world of Dahna. Within the realm, each region of Dahna comes with its own unique biomes, architecture, peoples, and problems. The game takes you through each of these unique regions and immerses you into their ambience with the beautifully orchestrated music as well as the lovingly crafted environments. And as is the case, each differing realm comes with its own host of unique problems, so don't worry too much about getting bored; there are many twists and turns in each region to keep things engaging. Tales of Arise is a truly visually stunning game. If you can play it in 4K, I'd highly recommend you do so. 

[h1] Combat [/h1]

The combat in Tales of Arise is slightly different from most games. Although open-world, the game actually transports you into combat instances for fights rather than keeping you in the over-world for fighting. The combat mainly consists of combo chaining, allowing you to do fancy movements and specials. Each member of your party is playable, and they all come with their own set of unique abilities and move-sets (and holy smokes, do the fight animations look stellar). Along with the natural character progression, you can further enhance each character's stats using items you find throughout game. While nothing groundbreaking, the combat allows for a mixture of dexterity and strategy, all enhanced with colorful visuals.

[h1] Sound/Music [/h1]

I've been gushing over this game so far, and I'm pleased to say that the soundtrack is to be praised just the same. Each region of the game is host to its own unique theme, and these compositions manage to give a grand feel to each location. For the sound design itself, I had no complaints. All in all, I was pleased with the sounds and melodies composed for the game. While I won't say the Tales of Arise soundtrack is anywhere comparable to something such as the recent Halo: Infinite soundtrack (it's stellar), you can be sure that your ears are kept pleasantly delighted.

(MAJOR SPOILER: BE WARNED) [spoiler]And don't even get me started on the three singing tracks in the game[/spoiler] (DO NOT LOOK THESE UP UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPOIL SOME OF THE BEST MOMENTS IN THE GAME)

[h1]Gripes/Issues[/h1]

To be honest, there was very little I took issue with in the game. The game was very well put together, and there wasn't much room for error. However, I did find that the first region of the game gave off a very campy, tropey vibe, which I wasn't all that excited for. After clearing the area, however, the plot picks up, and I was pumped. Next, though this is not really an issue I had personally, some reviewers have complained about the grind in the game. In my playthrough, I didn't really have to grind too much at all. I maybe spent an extra 5 hours altogether to grind when I needed to be a higher level for certain encounters. You could probably do even less than that depending on the items you acquire and food you cook. 

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!! THE GRIPE BELOW IS ABOUT THE LITERAL ENDING OF THE GAME!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPOIL A HUGE PART OF THE GREAT STORY THAT WAS WRITTEN FOR THIS GAME!!! PLAY THE GAME FIRST!!!

[spoiler]Now, I'm not going to say the ending was bad; it was far from it. In fact, the ending was actually perfect from a thematic point of view. HOWEVER, I was DEEPLY disappointed that the game does not continue after the final cutscene, and that important points of closure for the story are summarised in still images. What SHOULD have been done, is after the final boss, you should have been able to speak to each of the characters in regards to all that had transpired, and you SHOULD have been able to continue playing the game from then on as normal as well as being able to do some closure quests for each of the main characters (a wedding quest for Shionne & Alphen, a diplomacy quest for Dohalim, or maybe even an endgame quest to finish off the remaining astral beasts on Dahna). Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed at the lack of closure, and I was feeling the same when you're forced to continue the game from a point before the final boss. So, if you want to continue playing the game for the 100% clear or just to get endgame armor and weapons, you're forced to playthrough the rest of these moments in the context that Shionne is still cursed, and Alphen and her haven't had their moment yet. How disappointing... [/spoiler]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Tales of Arise is a breathtaking adventure set in a lovingly crafted world with fleshed out characters and a meaningful story. If you have the chance to play it, do it. I paid full price, and it was the best $80 I spent this year (CAD). If you've not played it yet, don't read anything more about it.

The story and characters does fall into the typical, anime-style tropes--but overall--the character interactions and banter between them were entertaining to watch at least. Another aspect of the game that I found disappointing was the lackluster side quests and reskinned enemies.

My favorite Tales of Series so far
- The visual is amazing
- The optimization is really good. My laptop can run this game at 110 fps+ with high setting
- The story is quite interesting
- The combat is much better than the previous tales of series. Now you can perform normal attack that doesn't consume your stamina gauge. So you can still attacking while run out of stamina. The perfect dodge mechanic allow you to trigger counter attack that is deal high damage to knock your enemy.  The boost attack also makes the battle more cinematic.
- I love the character design, especially Shionne <3
- This game is not open world but each region have large scale area that you can explore

This game mechanically is on the higher end when compared to other games in this franchise. While my enjoyment of this game was very plentiful, I can't say this is a game I'd recommend others to play. Especially if I were to recommend this game as their first ""Tales of"" game.

I won't list anything as pros and cons due to the fact that the game's best aspects can have some negative features and vice versa.

- Story: The story is honestly one of the worst written in the franchise. There's constant moments where you'll question the writer's choices in terms of narrative directions due to the abundance of plot holes. There's also the issue that the story's pacing in general is very inconsistent. At moments it will drudge by and other moments, things will escalate without any build up. The ending especially is terrible in this case.

-Characters: I can say that the voice actors likely didn't have the freedom that they would have liked. I feel like the voice actors would have done a better job if they were given at a little bit more expressive freedom. Due to the fact that the writing was so bad, It felt like they were all only allowed to read the lines exactly as they were laid out in front of them. Every character had to conform exactly to their character archetypes.
Alphen = Typical MC
Shionne = Tsundere
Rinwell = Little Sister
Law = Muscle Brain
Kisara = Big Sister
Dohalim = Baritone Voice Dude

- Combat: I can say the combat has definitely evolved from Tales of Zesteria and Tales of Berseria. The defensive options in this game genuinely feel rewarding similar to how it felt when I played Tales of Graces. Perfect Evading/Guarding Is a genuinely rewarding feeling. The combo system seems to have taken a bit of a dive though. Combos are a lot more inconsistent to string together due to the hit-boxes of the characters likely being smaller than usual. It seems the only person with consistent hit-boxes is the main character Alphen. Some enemies also feel like they're more likely to drop out of combo's than others which adds a bit to the frustration. FINALLY one of the biggest issues is having to fight a boss in it's enraged state. Instead of having a more challenging fight pattern or simply dealing more damage, bosses will just spam their ultimate attacks (Astral Artes) until you can kill them fast enough. The end of every boss fight is literally a DPS Check.

User Interface: The game has done many improvements to help with the overall quality of life enjoyment of the player. Accessory and Weapon crafting is simple and easy. As the game progresses, you're likely to have just the right materials and money to craft it on the spot. I never felt like I was lacking money or materials at any moment through my playthrough. The game gives you a lot of fast-travel options so you can quickly revisit areas that you went to in the past. Right before every boss fight, there will be a zone that will recharge your health and healing resource (cure points). Upgrading your character and their skills is pretty straightforward as well. 
My ONE HUGE GRIPE about the skills is that every character will have 3 TITLES locked behind a PAYWALL. Each title has 5 perks. And some perks will have a huge impact on gameplay while others will only have a minor effect. But the fact that a total of 15 perks per character being locked behind a paywall is a HUGE impact on the general gameplay. I FELT LIKE THIS WAS A BAD DESIGN CHOICE!!",1638153469,1638153774,False,5,0,0.546504616737365723,0,True,False,False

The combat was decent, the plot was solid (for the most part), and the skits were great. The skits were often very funny, and as a guy who appreciates humor, I liked that. Most of the characters were decent, but there were a few that really annoyed me. The soundtrack has very good, and I didn't encounter any bugs or glitches in my (very long) play through.

The only downside to me was that it was a smidge too grindy, and I wasn't a fan of the ending of the game. I didn't really like the route they took with the ending, but that's just my personal opinion. It does not detract from the enjoyment I had playing the game. The grind, though, was pretty real. It wasn't truly necessary to grind for the main game, but you needed to do it for end-game content. And that can take a while. I had pre-ordered the Ultimate edition of the game, so I was able to reduce this with some of the DLC content that makes the grind not so bad, but without that the (already long) grind would have been way worse.

Either way, it's a pretty solid game. I would suggest it to people who are a fan of JRPGS, and especially fans of prior ""Tales of"" games.",1638139910,1638139910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Next, combat system. I even don't know what to say. It could be ok for 2000 but even in 2000 we had better games. You are not feeling combat at all. It's not about diffuclty. Enemies not feeling you hits. All what your ""combos"" do are only damage. You making damage - you are great. Not thinking at all.
The story. May be it's really good, I don't have much progress on story. But I don't care. I bought game to play it. And I know how story based games looks like. This ""game"" so bad comparing with Life Is Strange as example.
Overall, It seems that game been designed for mobiles. Poor combats, many story lines, little of party managing. Even for mobiles this one not good. Other modern games able to give you much better experiance.
My recomendation is simple: skip, don't buy this game.",1638102537,1638102537,False,1,2,0.413300186395645142,0,True,False,False

Tales of Arise is the latest release and honors the 25th anniversary of the Tales franchise by being a really good game. One thing of note I will mention is that the visual feel is different from Zestiria/Berseria/Vesperia. The traditional anime style has been replaced with a more cel shaded look which still looks very visually interesting. It is different though than what some fans may be used to. Other than that though all the standbys are there. You have cooking and skits and outfits and a party of interesting characters. One thing though is that this game can be a bit darker in tone than the other ones which may put people off. Slavery and oppression are kinds of major themes and are pretty frequently mentioned. So with those caveats I would definitely recommend it for any fans of Tales games and of long JRPGs in general.,1638091257,1638091257,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The side quests were also very enjoyable. I played on moderate and i did not find it too grindy, i think it was just nice. But i got to say the last few portions of the game suffered quite a bit but i don't think its that bad it was still enjoyable in a sense. Combat was very engaging and refreshing. The boss fights are very very fun. Filled with a great cast of main characters, some of them might seem unlikable at first but they grow on you eventually. The narrative was good.
