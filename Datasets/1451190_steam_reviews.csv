Undisputed career mode and quick matches against the A.I is frustrating but fun for the most part.
However the A.I cheats like their is no tomorrow that's not fun.
Sure they tire between rounds but way slower than the player. 
They manage to punch you putting your head in the red with 1 punch, not so for the player you have to hit them a ton of times. 
They always seem to be able to avoid most of your punches or at least mitigate them, even just after receiving a hard hit.
If the player takes a hard hit  you wobble around with little chance of hitting anything for a few seconds which is fine but it needs to affect the A.I in the same manner.
The player and A.I need to both follow the same parameters the fights feel very rigged currently.
The A.I need to tire more and make mistakes now and then, be a little more human like.

The swelling, this is really, really bad.
The first few times I saw the red face I assumed the character was exhausted. Nope red face is swelling apparently. 
Swelling needs to be represented by actual facial swelling not a ridiculous red face. 
The blood looks off as well, it looks like dried blood.
While some attempt at injury's is better than none it is pretty shoddy at best.

Knockouts, how does the guy that is knocked out always end up in the center of the ring?
 Having just one cut scene for this looks like sh*t. 
Same when the A.I takes a knee the exact same animation every time. Just add some slight variation and it won't look so bad.

Mini games for training  between  fights is badly needed. It would be nice to actually practice punches on a bag, spar with another boxer or do weights to improve strength, that sort of thing.

Overall it's still fun, the game does have a lot of potential but still needs some work.",1707884398,1708956074,True,0,0,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,True

I have ONLY played against AI, with a focus on career mode, and my perception of the game's balance is going to be entirely based on that. I did NOT play any version of this game prior to the recent career mode update. Prior experience with boxing games was a little FN Round 4, and a LOT of Fight Night Champion. I'm allowing comments for this so if I'm misreading something or I've missed details please, lemme know.

[h1]THE FIGHTING[/h1]
[h2]Footwork[/h2]
The distinction between tight and dancing footwork is an interesting one. Tight footwork lets you control your linear distance to target with more snappiness. Dancing footwork makes your lateral adjustments flow more and with a slightly higher movement speed, at the cost of being ""easier to knock down"" though that's never explained with specificity in-game. 

[h2]Striking[/h2]
Striking is a mixed bag. Jabs feel pretty good, but straights feel stiff and slow. Hooks feel pretty good, especially out of a combo, unless it's a left hook to the body, which has this bizarre long wind-up. I weigh 195, have no formal boxing training, and I can throw a left body hook from orthodox stance with SIGNIFICANTLY more speed than this game's professional boxers can. 

Launching punches out of movement, or using the move+punch commands, are pretty good. There's a large breadth of options here in that regard. Your boxer will MOST OF THE TIME plant the correct foot when punching out of movement, but not always, leading to weird instances of ""floating"" that happen multiple times per fight.

[h2]Defense[/h2]
Defending is also a mixed bag. Blocking is fine. Avoiding damage is no guarantee during a block but that's true in boxing too. In fact, I think blocking is TOO reliable, but that's just me. I think not getting hit at all is preferable, which is why in FN:Champion I used a lot of head movement to try and slip punches. 

Which is why it's a damn shame weaving in this game feels like shit. Punches seem to find your head no matter how well-timed your weave is, with misses from your opponent seeming to have nothing to do with timing, and more a result of the Accuracy stat RNG. There's a ""Slip"" command to set-up for slip counters but...eh? Maybe I'm just bad with it, but I find it kind of hard to use and since it's using stamina it just doesn't feel worth learning, because...

[h2]ABYSMAL Counter System[/h2]
...the window for counters is a MILE WIDE. You literally don't need the slip, or even weaving, to trigger the Counter effect for the bonus damage. I'm sure fighting real players is different, but against AI, even on higher difficulties, staying in loose movement for most fights and floating in an out of range is enough to land counter shots with surprising consistency. I've had counters land well after the REAL counter window of the blow, where it should just count as a regular punch.

[h2]Health and Stamina[/h2]
Serviceable but needs improvement. Swelling seems to take a LONG time to occur, and cuts don't seem to get worse no matter how much you bash them in the same cut over and over. Over-punching doesn't really have a strong cost unless you're throwing bomb after bomb constantly. People talking about gassing their boxers early during the beginnings of career mode, I did not have this issue. You and your opponents have less health and defense, not just less stamina, so you don't need as many punches. Throw fewer punches.

[h1]AI[/h1]
The AI in this game is kind of decent, since fighters have noticeable tendencies and habits, but they also have really inconsistent skill displayed during a fight, most often in the opening of a round. You could be tagging the hell out of a guy all round and get two knockdowns, and dude will come out the next round, slip/block/weave EVERYTHING, counter punch with flawless proficiency, and dismantle your defense like he was completely rattled and barely standing 80 seconds prior. 

The AI does not ""learn"" anything either, which I feel they should since a coach would be giving them advice they need to adjust. AI that have bad habits of keeping their hands down will do that every round and never adjust, making them easy knockouts. 

On the bug front, AI will sometimes just...stand there. Hands down. Or they'll do a taunt at point blank range like I'm not gonna immediately 4-hit combo them in the skull. Just makes some wins feel cheap, like I didn't have to try, and this happens on even maximum difficulty.

EVERY NOW AND THEN, I'll have a fight with an AI that is memorable, both of us landing hits, on the knife of losing your momentum. But it's rare.

[h1]Career Mode[/h1]
Is terrible. The fighter creator is meh. Serviceable, but meh. A lot of options for molding the face but barely any for molding the body, few hair selections for both head and face (no stubble option? lmao c'mon). I don't really care much about that, it's a little lacking in immersion but lets talk about the meat of the mode. 

It's VERY boring. There are loading screens between menu selections, which is...just insane to me. I don't think I've ever played a game that did that. It takes like 30 seconds for the Fight News bulletin to update, and the news updates lack any creative writing or dramatic flair, it's just stock standard updates on the ""fight world"" but who gives a shit? I'm a welter-weight, I do not care what's happening in the Bantamweights. 

Upgrading your staff is...linear. You get more fame and money, ergo you get better staff. It really doesn't matter which of the staff you pick as long as they have better stats than the last guy, so it's more of a ""upgrade these dudes real quick and be done with it"". 

Choosing a training gym is OBVIOUS. Seriously. Choose the one with the highest XP multiplier, period. I don't remember what the gym was called but there's one that only has like a 20k sign-up fee and you get a x3 stat multiplier. I used that, and that only, for fights 5 to 25. After that you can afford gyms that just GIVE you points in every category and ALSO give you an XP multiplier. 

The meta for training is simple. Shore up your weaknesses, then space your training out accordingly, ensuring you can be at max fight sharpness and within weight. It's easy to do this, and there are no mini-games like in FN:Champion so you can't improve at training, something I thought was really cool in Champion. It's a math game here more than anything. 

Contract negotiation is neat but only sometimes useful, mostly for avoiding unwanted rematches. 

Career feels like a distraction between fights. You don't make interesting decisions. You don't feel like you're creating meaningful rivalries. You don't feel like there's a real story that you're creating through your own actions. There's very little immersion. 

[h1]CAREER AESTHETIC[/h1]
The announcer for fights seems phoned in, devoid of emotion. The commentators dialogue is extremely repetitive, but that's fine since I always turn that off in Fight Night as well. The crowd noises are...a little weird. There's no flow to when they get louder or quieter, sometimes they just flip out for no reason, or after a really hype ending to a round, the next round they'll be dead silent and it's really jarring. I don't like the sound design much but it's FINE, like it works well enough.

When you win the belt its just the same victory cutscene that always plays after a fight and you get a splash page. Even for belt unification. Where's the pageantry? Where's my fighter breaking down on the mat or the crowd exploding for the momentous occasion? It's all just...onto the next fight or whatever. A real letdown.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Look man I have FN:Champion and while it has it's problems, the feeling of training for big fights and the hype of victory, and how fighting actually feels, beats this game easily. Right now, I can only recommend it if you have no way to play FN:Round 4 or FN:Champion, and to me that sounds like a good reason for a thumbs down.",1708671137,1708887975,False,1,0,0.504739344120025635,0,True,False,True

●	Computer Boxers
	○	They suck on the highest level setting ""Undisputed""... Id like to see Dark Soul level toughness; not a walk in the park. I literally crush them. This is why fight night was garbage. How are you gonna compete with the MMA games? 

●	All boxers
	○	Lack personality
		-	where is the games personality?
		-	where are the heroes and heels
		-	no ring announcements
		-	no belts in cut scenes
		-	where are the grudges? 
●	Very basic career mode
	○	Needs the ability to allow for fights to be made between close weight divisions
		-	The current limitations makes it hard to find good fights
		-	Why am I earning all this money because right now its not clear. 
		-	The gym system doesn’t make sense. There is only 1 A ranked gym. 
                -       There is just no reason to keep playing on
		-	In some ways this game should play like WWE story wise



I can say more; however, I‘ll close with this. The boxers need personalities to go with their styles. The game is just way to basic. It’s not hard at all.  There’s no real replay-ability.

The mode forces all your stats to hover around 50 to start the amateurs. What this means in practice is that you can slip twice OR throw a 3 punch combo (but not both) before your fighter starts sucking wind and can't fight. In a game that already heavily punishes you for having no stamina, this means you're opening yourself up to get KOed really easily after actually boxing for a few seconds. It's better to stand there and wait for your opponent to throw a 1-2, get tired, and hope you get lucky enough to land a counter power shot and win. So...the best strategy for this boxing game is to not box? Got it. Moving on.

They've added multiple female fighters (that nobody cares about or plays), a couple of no name male fighters (that nobody cares about or plays), venues, and the aforementioned career mode but still haven't fixed the actual boxing mechanics in this game. You say you're prepping for console release? Hate to break it to you devs, but this title is nowhere near ready for that

Punches I can see land but don't register? Check. Knocking out my opponent by strafing in circles while mashing the A button (rather than actually boxing)? Check. Unexplained stamina drain? Sure! The actual process of boxing in this so called ""simulation boxing game"" sucks and I still, after about 100 hours, can't recommend the game. By the way, all the above complaints are from the SINGLE PLAYER, because the multiplayer has not been in a playable state since this released and it could be argued has actually gotten worse.

Online play just means all the above issues are exacerbated tenfold and the rage from getting KOed by someone all the way across the ring (due to lag) would make a sailor blush. All in all, this game is a hard pass from me and without going back to the drawing board, I'm not sure how they could possibly fix it at this point.

Fight night is practically an arcade game in comparison to this, just listen to how bad the punch audio samples are for example.If you like a game that requires strategic thinking, quick reflexes and in-depth mechancs then this is for you. 

There are lots of 'niche' players wanting the penultimate boxing experience and are nit picking about things which I think is slightly unfair considering it's early access and most people (whether you're a boxing veteran fan or just a casual fan) will get a solid simulation of boxing. 

 Generally, the game feels a little lifeless like the coaches and stuff just seem like mannequins. But it's easy to get past that because the game-play completely makes you forget about that. Hopefully that kind of 'cinematic' polish that EA can do well (minus everything else) is included when story mode is added. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are amazing: almost life-like when fighting and have graphics set high. Although I feel the splash screens of the boxers discredits how good the graphics are when boxing in the ring.  I hope dev team isn't disheartened by all the criticism and gets carried away with tweaking, because as of the now it's worth playing and buying.


EDIT: After 280 hours with new release of career mode, hands down best boxing game i've played. The career mode ai is great and you really get a feeling of going up the ranks. Matches feel like they are hanging on a thread at times and all it takes is one good swing and that's what it should be like The new camera angle is really great, and it's improved my playing and i'm able to land uppercuts more easily. There are a number of things that could be improved like, adding slow mo cam, better knockout animations and for when you're trying to get up,  coaches have animations when watching outside the ring etc... Generally it lacks cinematic polish. But in terms of gameplay, I feel there is a learning curve that doesn't really have a limit similar so you can always improve your skills. I think another fight night might come out and tick all the boxes of looks with flashy knock down animations etc.... but I'm sure the gameplay won't be as deep as this, so I hope the game continues to thrive and people aren't put off by all these salty guys",1679421204,1708546043,True,20,6,0.572363138198852539,3,True,False,True

The amount of bugs, cheating, clunkiness, and desyncs is insane. These problems have only gotten worse with time, and none of the things that were promised from the developers is getting done. All they do is add a boxer from time to time, and a small amount of bug fixing (that usually create new bugs) every few months. It almost feels like they are just milking its current state and just being lazy about actually working on things like career mode and such. I was absolutely craving a new boxing game as it has been forever, but the old fight night games are a millions times better than this. Nothing feels satisfying in this game. Counters don't carry much weight, power punching doesn't carry much weight. It's like having a wet noodle fight. Ghost punches hitting you is always fun, and it always feels like you're playing with severe lag or packet loss. I have good internet too. Forget about this being realistic (because its far from it), its not even fun as an arcade game or anything of the sort. Probably my most regretted video game purchase of all time. I sure hope they prove me wrong in a few years, but I don't see this game ever being complete or being fixed. Definitely don't recommend!

UPDATE: This company is showing their true colors. Their most recent release is their last major update. They are focused on getting it on consoles in this current state. Pure cash grab and I'm quite confident that they will just abandon this immediately after they get it. They haven't fixed anything. They release a career mode that is so damn basic and horrible to play, that I'm just speechless.

Clunky controls and hit reg are better than they were a few updates ago, but are in need of fine tuning. 

I will say that Career Mode has been rewarding. At first I missed the mini-game style training of Fight Night, but I've come to appreciate what the developers have done as it makes camp less micromanage-y. I do wish tool tips and graphs were more helpful when it comes to negotiation (and more options), fighter traits, and fight camp training. When the AI counters negotiations, instead of a red thumbs down, why not provide info on what it would take to get the deal done so that the opportunity isn't lost?  Also, why are there simulated boxers with the same last name? Sometimes their names don't even match in the 'Last Five Fights' tab. And almost all of them look the same. Stronger AI identities help with immersion. 

It also seems you cannot fight for one of the major belts on their own, as in my journey all major game belts are held by one top boxer at one time. The ability to fight for one would be a cool addition. 

And lastly, please add more customization options. Hairstyles are not copyright, and the tattoos are honestly some of the worst pieces I've seen. Same with wardrobe.

I like how in depth the system is there's everything you would expect from it. It is the best boxing game you can get on pc so far. There are some details that are needed to round this game out and are heavily felt missing in the game. If you are not a hardcore boxing fan and would like any fighting game I wouldn't recommend this. Especially on PS there is UFC which clears this by miles.

PROS:
In depth career system
Nice core boxing mechanic
Many styles to chose from
In depth character builder
Online play

CONS:
Graphics already starting to look dated before 1.0 release
Many details missing from the game
- no cut scenes for anything other than pre-fight entrances (no titles even if there is a champion) and at the and again a very fast raising of the hand(again no titles). 
- commentators are laughable not that the voice actors are but it's just that they have so few recorded lines that it often seems like they are completely detached from what is going on in the ring. Commentators also don't seem to care much about title matches don't expect a mention.

Random injuries, while maybe 'realistic', just serve further bog down the career experience.

The commentary is so bad it might as well not be in the game, the announcers never refer to your fighter by it's nickname, and always repeat the same things after every round.

Developer's stated this 'career' patch was the last major update, so I'm not expecting significant improvements to the game.

Also, possibly the greatest sin, there's no replay system.  So that amazing knockout you had?  Hope you only wanted to see it once.

This game is on the decline!! Six updates have been released and the game has gotten worst with every one of them. Missed deadlines, over promising and under delivering, terrible movement, stamina is a joke, while being in their Discord I got banned for speaking what was truth (I could care less about being banned from a discord) my message was and is this.....Stop supporting these companies that hand out half @ss games and hide under ""early access"". Companies put these games out like that because they know people will just buy whatever as long as they use the right keywords or come up with a clever marketing strategy. Stop falling for the banana in the tailpipe and eating everything that's pushed in front of you, I too would keep copying and pasting games and releasing half finished games if I knew people were oblivious enough to keep buying them!! Wake up yall, like for real. (This is the kind of talk that got me banned from their Discord fyi) #FreeSpeech

Lastly, I don't see how Steel City has ANY good leadership in their office, most of what were in those six updates should have never seen the light of day.

Along with other new features, Career mode has now been introduced after the latest update. It's a game changer. 
The game still has room for improvement. But i advise people interested in buying the game, that it  is good enough to purchase now, during early release, before the price increases.
There is an ingame Shop that is currently locked. This is all speculative, but some of your favorite boxers will likely be behind a paywall. They will most likely have unique styles to match the boxer. Normally i hate paying for DLC that some may argue should be already included. But in this case i see it enabling them to pay for licencing and time taken with the boxers to produce some accurate & unique Avatars.
The play style is similar to the old Fight Night series, but way more strategic, less arcade. Mashing buttons is a quick way to get KO'd. 
Still some basic missing features, like instant replays. I think i killed Canelo in round 2, but i couldn't bask.

I was looking forward to the career mode since release and it arrived last week. There is plenty of potential but it is heavily flawed with numerous glitches and inconsistent AI opponents. I will bullet point my issues below. 

Players Boxer stamina is unbelievably poor even after a few fights and increase in stats. 

It takes the player a lot of hard work to knock down an AI opponent on PRO level yet the AI can literally floor you in two punches, the movement is also sluggish at times making it hard to withdraw from an attack on the inside. 

The knockout Mini Game has been poor and ignored from the very start, you must use you controller triggers to align with a green square on the screen, the first knockdown this is quite easy from the second onward's it is impossible and obviously massively spoils the game.

I arranged a bout, won the bought and when it came getting the fight rewards the fight was actually cancelled due to an injury and I received no rewards and the game went back to the arrange a fight screen. This has happened on 3 occasions. 

For me the career mode was the most important aspect of this game, I do not play online and have no interest. Unfortunately I am disappointed it is far too broken and inconsistent to be enjoyable. To be winning a fight clearly and easily then get knocked out with two punches and not be able to get up because of a very poor mini game I can not recommend this game for £34.99 to anyone it need a whole lot of work to come out of early access.

My only down side so far is eating the loss for a disconnected online fight. I also want to add that I appreciate the time and effort that Steel City Interactive has put into this simulation so far and here's to the early access focusing on constructive criticism and that the developers come through for the fans!

2/4/2023: Updated review;
          It's been nice to see developers respond to some of the issues brought up by other early access players, this gives me confidence that Steel City Interactive is trying to create a true simulation for fight fans.

          I would love to see an expanded training mode available as to build on customizing  your own boxer and in career mode, when properly polished.

 
          I hope to see a bigger roster both past and present.

          I would like to see a more systematic ranking system; 
                    (as far as after receiving my first ranking after my first five online fights, I was next matched with someone with not only a higher rank but many more fights under his belt)

  2/19/2023 Update review,
         I am still enjoying the game and looking forward to the full release, but I do hope that the developers are still working hard on the sifting through early access reviews.  I feel the controls can be a bit slow to respond. I understand that stamina will affect response speed but when the adrenaline  boost is activated by dazing my opponent, it seems like my boxer is just as lethargic making it nearly impossible to move in for the kill. 

Have the developers considered awarding a short timed speed boost after dazing an opponent??

  2/25/2023
         I have lost several online fights due to ""Ghost Punches"" my most recent loss; I got ""Ghost Dazed"" at the start of the 7th round and lost a fight that I Had in the bag!
I know Steel City Interactive has been working hard on this simulator and I also know I'm not the only one to have experienced these issues. I trust that this and other issues are diligently being worked on by the developers.

  3/5/2023
         Lag is a real thing.. I had  a lot of good  fights this weekend, win some lose some but I don't like loosing when characters freeze and next scene is the KO mini game. I hope that Steel City is still working hard and taking these reviews toward positive improvements.

3/12/2023
        I  am looking forward to the next update by the developers,  PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME AND THE HEED THE SUGGESTIONS OF YOUR EARLY ACCESS FANS! This is shaping up to be an amazing experience and can't wait as this game is polished to perfection.

3/19/2023
        After the latest update, I wanted to make the developers aware that I, personally have experienced a worse online experience. Fighters have been very ""glitchy"" and I was ""Flash KO'ed from half way across the ring. My graphics are not the issue; as when I play against AI the match is flawless. I understand that Steel City is still hard at work and I look forward to the success of their continued effort. 
        I would like to see a KO replay added to fights after knock downs. 
        Can you work on implementing a  ""cut-man"" mini game during recovery periods?
        I would like to see custom or individualized entrances for each fighter.


2/18/24
        So I did step away for a little bit waiting to see what Career mode brought to the fight,
and being that this is  early access; I feel that constructive reviews are the only way to make this game great! I like the Rags to Riches and am getting more familiar with the Simulation side of things and trying to keep yourself at your peak. Might I suggest that between rounds the option to watch round highlights according to the three judges, Add audio to the Cut man and Manager. I want some motivation between rounds! 

        I honestly think the Developers are doing a great job and adding Ring Girls couldn't hurt either!",1675389845,1708285013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[u][b] Gameplay [/b][/u]
There is so much to this game that meets the eye.
The movement and accuracy in the punches and the movement around the ring is remarkable.
There is a little customisation it can and should be expanded on.
It is easy to learn once you get used to the mechanics on controller.
Has some great music and awesome venues.

[u][b] Graphics/Frames [/b][/u]
On my rig i was getting no frame drops and a constant 90fps this is on career mode.
Not sure if online will bring the same results.

[u][b] Progression [/b][/u]
The progression is big as you train up your boxer there is opportunity to go for other belts and bigger prize fights. Train in bigger gyms and get better support from manager to Trainer and cut-man.
Change your look as you go also shift weight class.

[u][b] Final Thoughts [/b][/u]
It looks and feels good it is super fun in career mode but i feel not having Mini-games for the training lets it down also it needs more Character creation aesthetics and more clothing options.
Would be nice to upload logos and stuff. 

[u][b] Rating out of 5 [/b][/u]

Never dreamed of a career mode, but it is very cool, the artificial intelligence is quite difficult, but it motivates to fight and win! The fact that in the new update with super punches you can knock out with one and two punches, or with several side hooks, this is very correct and realistic, may this balance always be like this!

  First, I created a fighter and indicated the age of 40 years, and at 50 he is forced to retire and therefore failed to become a champion (he only reached the 29th month in the rating). When the second time he created a fighter (age 18 years old) with the nickname Wladimir Klitschko (with the style of Wilder), he was able to become the world champion in 2 days and take the 1st place in the ranking with a record of 37 wins, 37 knockouts and zero defeats (OVR 88) (he was a little cunning ( Alt+F4) so that defeats are not counted, because some boxers are very difficult to beat the first time.) The game deserves the highest rating! All those who write negative are not honest and do not realize that there is simply no alternative to such boxing! In six months, I spent 493 hours in this boxing simulator, that is, 20 days, and reached the highest level 50.

  That I still want it to appear in future major updates even for extra money? Developers consider these big updates:

1. Add the Ukrainian language.
2. Add to the heavyweight division Wladimir Klitschko (new style develop), Vitali Klitschko (new style develop), David Tua (with new style), Ike Ibeabuchi, Mike Tyson (with Tyson style), Lennox Lewis, Andrzej Golota, Chris Bird, Evander Holyfield, Samuel Peter, Hashim Rahman, Michael Grant, Shannon Briggs.
3. Replay the best shots and knockdowns in online battles and during breaks between rounds.
4. Develop the ability to get up after a knockdown in the ring, instead of with an animation.
5. Develop the possibility of greater rewards for the fighter when he wins with the championship belt in his hands, etc.
For such a big future update, you could even pay an extra $10-$20.

Many thanks to everyone who made such a wonderful boxing game called Undisputed!



Українська рецензія:
Дуже дякую розробникам гри за режим кар'єри!  Ніколи не мріяв про режим кар'єри, але він дуже крутий, штучний інтелект досить складний, але це мотивує  боротися і перемагати! Те що в новому оновленні супер ударами можна нокаутувати одним і двома ударами, або декількома боковими хуками це дуже правильно і реалістично, нехай цей баланс буде завжди таким! 

 Спочатку я створив бійця і вказав вік 40 років, а в 50 він виходить примусово на пенсію і тому не вдалось стати чемпіоном (дійшов тільки до 29 місяця в рейтингу).  Коли другий раз створив  бійця (вік 18 років) з ніком Володимир Кличко (з стилем Вайлдера) то за 2  доби зміг стати чемпіоном світу і зайняти 1 місце в рейтингу з рекордом 37 перемог 37 нокаутом і нуль поразок (ОВР 88) (трохи хитрував (Alt+F4) щоб не зараховувались поразки, бо деякі боксери дуже складні,  щоб з першого разу їх перемогти.) Гра заслуговує найвищої оцінки! Все хто пише негатив, не чесні і не усвідомлюють що альтернативи  такому боксу просто не існує! За шість місяців я провів в цьому симуляторі боксу 493 години, тобто 20 суток і досяг найвищого 50 рівня.

 Щоб ще я хотів щоб з'явилось в майбутніх великих оновленнях навіть за додаткові гроші? Розробники подумайте над такими великими оновленнями:

1. Додайте Українську мову.
2. Додайте у суперважку категорію  Володимира Кличка (новий стиль розробіть), Віталія Кличка (новий стиль розробіть), Девіда Туа (з  новим стилем), Айк Ібеабучі,  Майка Тайсона (з стилем Тайсона), Ленокса Люїса, Анджея Голоту, Кріса Бірда, Евандера Холіфілда, Самуеля Пітера,  Хасіма Рахмана,  Майкла Гранта, Шенона Брігса.
3. Зробіть повтори кращих ударів і нограунів в онлайн боях і під час переви між раундами.
4. Розробіть можливість ставати після ногдауну в рингу, а не з анімацією.
5. Розробіть можливіть більших нагород бійця, коли він перемагає з поясом чемпіона в руках і тд.
За таке велике майбутнє оновлення можна б було навіть додатково платити 10 - 20 доларів.
6. Дозвольте створеними боксерами грати в онлайн режимі.

Allow users to create their own tattoos for full body art, sleeves etc would be nice since the tattoos provided are just not it, loving all the Nordic Stuff tho since im from Iceland myself. 

Career:

Career is fun and extremely detailed once you learn how it works. Enjoying it still right now. I would say allow us to create online Leagues for careers etc and possibly allow us to edit out intro.

Online:

Stay the fuck away from online with this game. So many cheaters using WEMod atm. Only know this cuz i looked it up. Been knocked out with 1 punch every time i play ranked using Ali, Fury which isnt going to happen im sorry. Your energy deplets so fast. Online doesnt even need to be out right now its that bad.",1708219185,1708219185,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Now they release what should've been the actual game and it came out broken (v0.7), a whole day passed for them to actually patch the broken update.
Career Mode and Create a Boxer finally work now but I don't know if it's worth $30 with all of these red flags, if you have the spare money and/or zero expectations, maybe, there's nothing else like it on PC, but it's still lacking so much.
You can't use your created boxer in online, not even in a privately created lobby to goof around with your friends, it's for exhibition fights vs CPU only and Career mode which is also vs CPU only.
And this Career mode is cool, but everything is simulated except your actual fights, so all training/prep is not a mini-game, it's a 2D manager.
 
I'd like to see them implement: 
✔Mini games as training where you have the chance to get more points depending on your performance.
✔Created fighters in online.
✔Custom tournaments to play online with randos or friends with all sorts of customization.
✔More character creator customization.
✔Workshop to share fighters and other custom stuff.
✔and maybe a venue creator for players to create cool arenas to fight in. 

So even though this was released more than a year ago, it just started to show a little promise now.
Will the devs be able to pull through and give us the boxing game we all dream of? Who knows.
Maybe they will, or maybe this is going nowhere and you'll have to accept both outcomes and anything in between as soon as you buy this.",1681868046,1708219059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ranked Fights litered with cheaters who ( drain your stam bar, increase their damage) etc.

But with those at least the game is still playable but what I believe makes it unplayable are the 10 minute loading screens  (I have had one last 10+ minutes and I have a decent pc) and the fact you can barely get hit and get knocked down.

It looks like the only option to get the opponent dased is to be aggressive and land at least 3-4 strong punches, however it will drain your stamina dramatically. BTW, an AI opponent can spam strikes at you and not deplete his stamina. I've checked the stats of my fighter and my opponent. They were +/- the same. I've tried not to use power punches - only regular combos (power punches cost more energy). I've landed more strikes than my opponent to the body (strikes to the body are supposed to reduce stamina/energy), and fewer strikes in general (so I was more accurate), and still at the end of the fight my opponent had more stamina than me. 
AI cheats in this game. :( It looks like AI can spam strikes with no energy cost. In addition, even if I have full energy recovered, my fighter lays his punches like he is exhausted.

better customisation for create a fighter such as more different short styles (as the designs look like they were created in MSpaint), boot and glove brands (not just rival and cleto reyes) better tattoo designs, the ability to actually write on the shorts would be nice. 

what set fight night champion different from this was the amount of extra stuff you could do such as legit training camps, better commentary and starting from an actual amateur backround working your way up. yeah in the first three fights you have in this game are classed as ""ameteur"" but is not? wheres the head gear? red and blue singlets?

As for this game, the bones are here for something that could be truly great.

Things this game needs to be the Greatest.

1- Punches should be worked on and improved to have more weight and snap.
2- Add an option for Fighter Robes and a Towel option for Tyson.
3- Ring Card Girls, where are they?!
4- Commentary is greatly improved but needs more work, does not follow the action.
5- Facial damage is lacking, swelling and cuts need to be improved.
6- Add more Legends, open that Fight Store!
7- Different Referees, Ring Girls and Ring Announcers are needed for variety.
8- The in game A.I. is not very smart and needs to be worked on.
9- The getup mini Game with the two meters is Horrid, the best getup mini game ever in a boxing game was in Fight Night Round 3 where the Referee was in your face and it was a double image because you were dazed and using the sticks you had to marry the images to one image using the Logo on his pocket as a guide. The more messed up you were the harder it was to use the sticks to do this. They must revamp this meter system in the game and replace it..
10- Add a better explanation on how the game option works to improve weight and fight condition between fight camps, personally I figured it out after I couldn't make weight for two fights.",1675529087,1708195948,True,1,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,True

UNDISPUTEDLY THE WORST GAME EVER!!
RAN OUT OF SPACE TO SAY HOW BAD THIS GAME IS
THIS GAME IS COMPLETE TRASH. DON'T BUY, LET IT DIE, SO ANOTHER STUDIO CAN MAKE A BETTER BOXING GAME. THESE UNTALENTED DEV'S DON'T CARE, THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME MONEY BEFORE THEY ABANDON THE GAME. 
SO MANY THINGS ARE WRONG IN THIS GAME, UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. FEEL LIKE I GOT SCAMMED. GIVE ME MY FUCKING MONEY BACK!!! 
NOT ENJOYABLE, JUST FRUSTRATION. DEV'S SHOULD RE-THINK THEIR CAREER CHOICE. I TRIED LIKING THE GAME, BUT IT IS SO HARD TO IGNORE HOW BAD IT IS. DEV'S PROMISED A CHAMP AND GAVE US A CHUMP! 

And we shall continue to wait for a good boxing game...
Played for 4 hrs and I can report that this game reminds me of a bad cell phone game from 2015. Game needs so much work that I can only hope the dev's don't abandon it, and start hyping up undisputed 2 by June 2023.
Graphics are ok. Interested in game play, would trade better graphics for game play any day. Game play is frustrating, human fighters feel they are in the 15th round when starting the 3rd round. PC fighter NEVER loses stamina. Human fighter get slow and weak to fast, throwing a 2-3 punch combo becomes almost impossible. It drains your fighter and can only throw slow motion punches. Fights become painfully boring, slow and unreal. Human fighters do almost no damage compared to the PC fighter. I have hit opponents with 2-3 consecutive good shots without effect. Opponent takes a step back, recovers fully in seconds, and rushes back at me while I'm still gassed out. PC countering is unrealistic and extremely accurate. PC counters hit you before your hand finishes the punch you threw. Stamina drain is ridiculously fast for human players and the game gets quite boring in a hurry since you can't generate enough momentum to re-create the excitement of a boxing match. Human fighters feel stiff, but PC can still be lightning fast with no stamina. Game is terrible, but what takes the cake is the mini game to get up after being knockdown. You have to have lizard eyes to be able to pull that one off. It needs to go.
 Defense side of the game is good animation wise, but useless. PC punches through any defense you put up. They generate damage even if you block punches. Their reach is exaggerated. Undisputed level fighter is stupid fast even without stamina. Game feels like it was shelved for a year and a half, then released because the studio ran out of money. I REGRET buying it. Really hope they keep working on it, it could become a good game. 

Haven't played online and would not dare to for fear of the cheaters that I'm sure by now are using the no stamina drain, ultra damage, speed cheats that will make you feel as if you are fighting Mike Tyson in god mode, versus you with hands tied behind your back.
Comments might point out that this is an early access version, and I get that, but dev's had a lot of time to work on this game before releasing it in this disastrous state. Should have made it a free demo so they could get feedback, fix it and then charge for it.   
Dev's should add sliders to increase/decrease pc/human fighter abilities like accuracy, punch speed and power. Adjust the disadvantages of PC stamina drain versus human stamina drain, redesign the mini game to get a fighter back up after a knockdown. Give us replays, round by round scoring. Please look at speeding up the punches for human player fighter when tired. Avoid this game until they patch it up. Thanks! 

* UPDATE 1* after playing for 20 hours*. Dev's you want to make a realistic boxing game??? ADD A DAMN REF!!! 
 Even Mike Tyson's punch out had a ref. The last boxing game I remember without a ref was Intellivision's boxing from 1978. And please be real, fights should not end up with a fighter throwing over 1000 punches. Much less with a fighter absorbing 600 head punches and somehow still manage to win...Or stay alive.
Human Fighter's attributes do not seem to matter, punches do not do damage, I found that to have success against the PC is to become a counter puncher. If you go on the attack the PC unrealistically counter punches and blocks you every time. The result and downside is that you engage in a very boring fight. Compubox scoring here is completely broken and unrealistic, the score per round seems to be assigned at random. I have finished rounds or full fights with a much higher accuracy in all punch types and still lose many rounds. Fix the uneven stamina drain, I've had fights where my fighter stamina is at 60% by the 4th round and the PC player is still at 100%. A good way to describe how bad the punching is when boxers get tired...it feels like they are fighting UNDER WATER. It's an underwater tap and slap match. A boxer will slow down and have decreased power when tired, but not at the rate you see in this game. A real fighter will never get gassed out in the first 3 rounds of a fight, that's what they train for. Fighters in this game get so tired after throwing a couple of combos, they fight like they can't lift their arms anymore. Plus, a fighter if successful at blocking or avoiding a flurry of punches could regain stamina via the adrenaline rush he gets. Include that. 
 Dev's focus on the human vs PC game play, not just on online play. Human vs PC is completely unrealistic and frustrating. 
I have encountered game play bugs like PC fighter just standing next to me getting hit and doing nothing to defend himself. There are many times where the PC boxer moves weirdly and I end up facing his back. PC fighter stuck in ""HUG MODE"" and won't stop wanting to clinch (or make out). One time I was protecting my body and my boxers hand was twisted outwards. Fix the ridiculous clinches. There is no one to break up the clinch, human player can't do anything to break it and once over you have no stamina. Why would the fighter who clinches get his stamina back? but not he one who gets clinched. If anything the one who gets clinched should get it back faster than the clincher, as the clincher will be using more stamina to sustain the clinch. At least make it even. Also encountered punches that seem to go through my opponent, punches that just stop before landing, unnatural arm angles when punching, ghost punches, and punches that don't register at all. I have also seen the PC start 
a punch, then stop midway and start another punch. Issues regarding controller response as well, pressing buttons at times doesn't do anything, or they are late in activating.   
Bottom line is that the game is terribly unrealistic and boring. Not worth buying at this time. Wait until it's fixed.

*UPDATE 2* After 20+ hours...Uninstalled this garbage game. Maybe I'll try again after a couple of months if they fix the game. Steer clear of this trash. Not worth $30, not even worth free.  

*UPDATE 3* Gave it another chance. DO NOT BELIEVE positive reviews, they are FAKE, computer generated, or done by people who got the game free. Had two fights in which the PC fighter did not lose stamina, they lost a little more of the red bar, but how can a PC boxer's white bar be at 100% in the 15th round?? While mine was at 48%? The PC fighters DO NOT receive damage, unless you spam one single punch. This game reduces boxing to a joke. This game will die in a couple of months. I highly doubt it will make it to a full release. Crappy selection of boxers, the good ones probably felt embarrassed to be on such a bad game. The ones included probably didn't play it or they just cared about the pay they got.

*UPDATE 4* Heard they released a patch for the game, so I tried it out. The game is still TRASH and I honestly do not believe it will get better. Did the Sugar Ray Robinson vs Sugar Ray Leonard challenge, and Leonard had 100% stamina in the 15th round. Refund policy should be more forgiving as it's an early access disaster. Do not see a full release in this game's future, unless studio brings in more experienced talent to work on the game.",1675298857,1708150046,False,1,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,True

They finally gave us the campaign.

My initial assessment was not good since the start is meh and you have no idea what to expect - i was afraid there would be no belts, etc. -> instead the devs take you on a ride through starting out in a bracket before your pro career starts.

The campaign is nowhere near perfect - on the screen before the fight, you can only see details about yourself instead of also who you are fighting against - i bet this will be solved soon.

Outside of that, the depth and breath of what they currently have in the campaign is absolutely outstanding.  Maybe even more than I care to manage (manger, cut man, etc. with contracts and renewals), but I appreciate the details.

I can feel there is still much to be done but they came out of the gate with a much bigger campaign than I ever expected.  I look forward to loosing my next fight.

GREAT JOBS DEVS!!!!

The campaign is severely broken.  There is not one.

** UPDATE **
Supported early access so it moved along. Still no campaign. Nothing to bring you back. 


I am REALLY looking forward to the full game.  I have waited a long while for a good console/pc boxing game and this one definitely seems like it will fill the void.  I very rarely do reviews but I feel this is worthy in hopes of keeping the development momentum.

- The magical phase through punches, and glitchy inside fights makes fighting on the outside  better than trying to plant something on the blur of models in front of you (sometimes they like to twist around each other and lose their lock on the target in front of them shooting somewhere off to the side of the fighter). 

- There is also some weird balance things going on with fighters, I just played as deontay wilder against muhammad ali, ali did more dmg than wilder on the same number of punches to the same area

- Being stunned is also a bit of a free get out of jail card, as those phase through punches seem to occur even more and it is incredibly frustrating to close out the fight if not impossible at times. 

- This is all not to mention the imput lag, and the fact that the game makes my PC feel like its about to achieve nuclear fission (i got a higher end PC so idk what will happen to console or laptop gamers). 

EDIT 4: this game is a series of numbers and stats that all make sure nothing that happens makes sense. I think they tried to capture the random nature of fighting and in doing so they made a horrible mess that isnt even fun against a CPU, where fighters power, knockdowns, movements, and all the rest comes from is a mystery. Also feels like the game has gotten less fluid since release.

The things i have now noticed that i HATE about the game is that even if you are fully blocking the AI can still connect shots like you aren't even blocking, power shots are slower and don't connect half the time even when being right up in their face or when i'm in perfect hit distance, The round system is now confusing and doesn't score properly in my opinion.

I have also noticed that it now takes even longer to load into a fight and I was waiting for at least 15 minutes before actually loading in. I have a high spec PC and have not had this issue until the latest update

At least the pros are you can create your own boxer now!!

They have fixed a lot of the issues since first release like the right hook spam exploit. Overall the game is quite fun at first. That is, until you realise how inconsistent the gameplay is. Its only fun if you play this game on a SUPER CASUAL level and don't care whether or not the more skilled player wins. If you try play this game competitively it is very frustrating in defeat and unsatisfying in victory. Because skill doesn't matter in this game. I've played this game extensively with a buddy of mine and we are quite competitive. After many hours of sweaty play we've come to the conclusion that this game is at least 50% luck. The damage is super random. Sometimes punches do hardly anything and sometimes its a 1-hit KO. Whenever you block something correctly there's still a 50% chance the punch just connects anyway. Whenever you try to step or dodge there's a 50% chance it just doesn't happen and your boxer just stands there and eats a shot to the face. The judges are on drugs. They are so thick on the packet with how they score these fights sometimes, its a joke. The success of every action and interaction comes down to a dice roll in this game. So many times my buddy has outplayed me the whole match only for me to get a lucky high damage punch that somehow goes through his guard and its GG, I win. And vice versa. Victory hardly ever feels deserved. 

Besides this, its the best boxing sim game I've ever played and worth a try if you enjoyed games like Fight Night. If the devs could just tone down the random dice-roll nature of this game and fix the input system it would be great coz the gameplay mechanics are well thought out and very engaging. I get that this is a sim and such randomness is part of real-life boxing. But in a video game that just isn't fun. Its more fun to actually get rewarded for your skill like in more traditional arcade fighters like street fighter and tekken. Great game but I can't recommend it coz the luck factor kills it for me.

Online's still unplayable due to ridiculous lag and cheaters and offline's barebones.

Really disappointing.

Edit: came back to give this game another chance and try out the career mode. Unfortunately while it worked for the first time, now the save doesn't load and I'm stuck on the loading screen indefinitely. Huge disappointment.

The career mode is what I was waiting for most; For it being out for a week I would say its a very good start. Being able to create your own fighting and customize their equipment is amazing. But the lack of training and other things to do in career mode its pretty dry. But the actually fighting and progressing through your career is fun. The variety of opponents keeps things interesting, and the sense of progression is incredibly rewarding.

Undisputed is a great experience that delivers on the promise of an authentic and enjoyable boxing simulation. While there are things to be added and fixed, the team behind this game is transparent and listens to the community so I do think this game will be perfect at some point in the future .

PLZ EA HURRY UP;....... i hate playing games that im not controlling and B.... does janky shhh to balance gameplay.... i couldve sworn i was fightin mike tyson.... when i played my first official career match... i decided to choose the 60 rated fighter to fight first...because how much harder could he be over my 47 rated player WITH ME CONTROLLING HIM....  and it was insulting.... im beating this guys head in ...but it didnt matter because the every time he hit me my health dropped as if i were not supposed to beat this guy.......... nahhhh im good on that.  it was insulting......  A BROKEN AND UNFINISHED GAME.... EVERYTHINGS BROKEN.... THE FIGHTERS.... THE MENU..... THE LEADERBOARDS.... THE OPTIONS..... THE COMMENTATORS.... EVERYTHING....

THE ONLY THING THIS GAME HAS IS GRAPHICS.  UNBALANCED AND BROKEN<<< SIMPLY PUT
WAIT UNTIL UNDISPUTED 2 OR UNTIL YOU HEAR IN THE RUMOR MILL THAT ITS FINALLY FIXED

**Update**   YOU ARE FIGHTING THE GAME AS WELL AS THE OPPONENTS

THE APPLIED STATS TO FIGHTERS ARE ILLOGICAL
DEONTAY WILDER CAN HIT YOU 60 TIMES IN 3 ROUNDS WITH STRAIGHT RIGHT HANDS AND NO AFFECT UNLESS ANIMATION LOTTERY APPROVES
DEONTAY WILDERS ACCURACY IS MISREPRESENTED....   THEY MAKE HIM MISS TO BALANCE HIM OUT AND IT AFFECTS YOU PLAYING WITH HIM..... IF HES FIGHTING SOMEONE LIKE FURY... HIS PUNCHES ARE GLANCES OFF HIS HEAD..... WHILST FURY SURGICALLY HITS YOU WITH EVERYTHING EVEN IF BLOCKING............<<< BROKEN STAT SYSTEM< AND AGAIN STATS SHOULDNT EVEN BE APPLIED TO THIS SORTA GAME...<<  IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE PLAYERS CONTROL...<<<<  THESE PLAYERS ARE MOSTLY NOOBS RUNNING IN....EMPTYING STAMINA...BACKING OUT.... AND COMING BACK IN...<<<<<<<<BUT WHY NOT.. WHEN YOUR OPPONENT CANT PUNCH YOU UNLESS THE GAME SAYS SO...... AND EVEN IF HE DOES.... SINCE HIS STATS ARE LOW...... IT WONT MATTER IF ITS RIGHT IN YOUR FKN......NOSE UNBLOCKED AT A SUPPOSED 90 SOMETHING POWER RATE 60 TIMES

FIX THIS FKN GAME BEOFRE THE YOUTUBERS WAKE UP!!!!!   

Power Punches are pointless on this game....... Hooks are the more effective powerful punches despite them being called ""power punches""

The game even brokenly.... blurts out each time you hit someone with a ""power punch""<<<  But again theyre useless....   150 power punches compared to 11 from opponent.......   Opponent still wins despite losing every round because your gassed after 5 rounds from throwing said power punches<<< which are landing square to faces.....KOs in 1st round only to watch the opponent get up....and spam his way back to victory with blocked hooks....<<<<THE BLOCKING FOR SOME FIGHTERS IS UNNAFFECTIVE.....  THEY ARE STUCK IN MUD.....  THE ANIMATIONS PREVENT PERFECT COUNTERS IF ANY AT TIMES....... HENCE THE SLOW MO PUNCHES..... 
**Update** <<<<< ... See Below +EXAMPLE:  You can be beating a guy down for 10 rounds.............Imagine a 69%(210/5** hit rate... compared to opponents 45%(110/1***)  >>> 210 Power Punches out of 350 compared to Opponents 2 out of 11.............Every round won 10 to 9........Opponent Dazed 3 or 4 times in early rounds....AND YOU STILL LOSE IN THE 10TH by KO(didnt even try to get up due to disgust)..cause a Noob your fighting a noob...and hes learned to just run in....jab at your stomach until hes punching like hes in Quicksand.... runs out of stamina....backs out....and does the same thing over and over for basically 10 rounds<<< Now imagine you seeing this 10000 times in this game already and constantly hitting dudes with DEONTAY WILDER with Straight ""power"" right hands the whole fight<< and not because im a noob... but because HES WALKING IN TO DO JABS TO MY STOMACH AND NOT BLOCKING....LEAVING ME TO JUST HIT HIM LIKE 30TIMES A ROUND WITH STRAIGHT ""POWER"" RIGHT HANDS(FROM DEONTAY WILDER).............................<<<< Again.. These dudes are walking into Right hands and walking away unfazed unless it hits some sort of lottery system KO/Daze...........They walk threw his right hands and just punch him in the Stomach and it Drains as if its a video game...................ON TOP OF HIS ACCURACY BEING ALMOST ANOTHER GAME IN ITSELF TO GET HIM TO CONNECT.....................  << I dont know if its a disrespect to him or a bad ratio of Stomach to HEad Power Punches.....<<<<<  The only reason im losing is cause im beating dudes in the head for the first 6 rounds WITH ONLY POWER PUNCHES/FULL STAMIINA/LEVERAGE/UNBLOCKED<<<<<<and im still losing because Stats Trump Gameplay<<<<<<<<<<    Get The Ratios right man...............    or at least fix the fkg Accuracy......      Im trying my hardest with this game.... But ive never played a game...where i can CLEARY SEE that im losing due to bad gameplay


**Update**  <<<<< nevermind... see below





***Old Review***


.......Just Bad Gameplay... and Broken/Unfinished...... My guy (Deontay..whos right hand is useless due to bad mechanics)....actually came out the corner at the start of the round staggered one fight............Phantom punches putting you into Dazed mode.....  Stamina isnt smartly applied to Boxing..... Stomach punches are over exaggerated with some fighters....while power punces on all Fighters are useless.......making 1 punch KOs more about animation positions instead of your inputs......  Guys walking into Deontays right hand unfazed,,,,..because it doesnt extend or pop......   He eventually gasses out or you have to dance around the ring avoiding other fighters with more punch accuracy than he has..... His punches glance off while others connect....... <<<< its a bad system of animations Trumping other animations.....  
Looks A+...But who cares when the animations are hit and miss
When your inputs arent registering..... Good Luck trying to beat A good Player with Fury unless you have Fury.... or maybe Ali....   And good luck with the right hand which is uneffective...and slow......  
I knocked out someone(still got to get up instead of being called....cause he folded like chair when fell....it was beautiful)........with Wilder.... but ive  never been able to replicate it... Hes been made to look like a fool and slow on this game.....  His right hand is useless unless you catch the right animation.......        And like NBA2K....  when your fighting someone with higher stats.... it seems as if it Trumps YOUR inputs....which of course prevents players from acting normal....   I was fighting Fury and was unable to even punch at times when just being around him.... whist he ticked away.....   I had to wait for Counters .... which only opened me up and Got me hit,,,,, cause my punches were slow(full Stamina)<<  Fix this....     Ive had good moments and tried to avoid reviewing but geesh.... The matches  im losing online... Im winning rounds but losing at end... cause im just out IQing players..... but my punches hald the time arent  inputing.....and are slow and weak.... so i feel like Apollo Creed against Ivan DRago",1675226552,1708041961,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This time I will keep it brief. Career mode adds something else to do sure, but it feels incredibly lifeless and soulless, for example you win a belt and you just get the standard lifeless victory animation. Announcers don't say anything, your character isn't given the belt(s) you won and they are also not shown with them at the next fight during your walk out. I will not be fair to the devs this time as they have had well over a year to work on this and put some heart and life into it. They did not do that. All this on top of the fact that you have to sit through 10 or more minutes of loading screens to do anything, even just going back and forth between menus you get sent to a loading screen that lasts at least 2-3 minutes with the occasional game killing loading screen where you have to reset your whole game cause it's soft locked with a loading wheel. Career mode is 90% loading screens and 10% boxing, and that's being generous. This update has shaken out to be a beautiful disaster at best. I was really holding out hope that they would fix a lot of things wrong with this game when they released career mode but they didn't. And knowing this was the last update before full launch meaning there will be no more fixes for who knows how long, I think it's time to put this one on the back burner boxing fans.

Controls are clunky and randomly respond or don't. You'll press the button for straight, or dodge and nothing happens or sometimes it does. Literally a dice roll on whether a fighter will do what you want. Total punch is awful as well as using buttons.

More animations for knockdowns and stuns.

Tighten up the hit boxes as others have said

Make the training actual mini games instead of sim

As someone who frequently enjoys playing sporting games like Madden NFL, Football manager, or anythign remotely sports-related, I really enjoy this game, much mor eever since the addition of the career mode.
The career mode lets you create your own fighter, hire coaches, cutmen and managers und takes you all the way to the very top of your division - generelly a very fun mode to play.
If you dont like carrer mode they still give you a roster of many different fighters to pick and fight against.
This can happen as player vs player (also remote-play together offered by Steam, which is very fun) or as player vs AI. If you would want the game to predict future matchups, the AI vs AIoption if also available.

I have never experienced technical difficulties (except of those fixed in a patch a day after occurence).

I only have so much time in this because of my love for fighting sports and do to ufc not being released on PC. I will tell you right now that the hit tracking is very off. For example, when you go to duck under a straight and go for a quick hook counter to the body or head on the ai on the non lead hand of the opponent your shot somehow doesn't connect and they wont be moving either which makes it even more frustrating. there are several instances like that, that make absolutely no sense, which in sense makes the game almost unplayable. I will say the movement and graphics of the game are mostly good. I have some issues with the movement because the quick weave feels way too fast on some people and the step back jab is absolutely ridiculous in this game. Now the other thing I say is the developers in a vid were very disrespectful to the people that look forward to this game and people that do play this game. Which made me have even less hope for this game. I really was looking forward to this game, but my hope is basically gone for this game. One last thing the damage gauging is really messed up and they need to work on that very badly because on some people it's basically impossible to knock them out even if they are getting hit like crazy and the ai's jacked and the stamina, but i've already wasted too much of my time making this review. listen just save yourself some frustration and wait til this game is finished because chances are its not gonna be anything insane or even good with the direction it is heading.",1707967824,1707967824,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Someone said to wait till career mode come out and let me tell you its not better either when get in detail on how they don't reward you. Every time I try to throw punches or combos they either don't connect when I'm standing right in front of them or they make me throw wild punches when my heart rate is low and my stamina is full but let the ai throw a bunch of wild bs punches and combos and they land everything and when they should be tired they still have a 100% accuracy as in they dont get wild punch animation. Now at first I thought it was because my accuracy was low but i basically have almost maxed out and the problem continues. I even drop the difficulty down and the ai still land everything and doesn't get wild punch animations. The other thing with throwing punches is i have a 95 speed at throwing punches and it is like 50/50 on if im going to get a fast punch animation or a slow punch animation like BRUH. My other problem with this game is idk if it is just the philly shell movement but if you throw one punch and try to back up your fighter acts like he can barely move leaving you open to getting tag with combinations from the cant miss ai. The slow movement last for like a few seconds before you can actually move again but hey guess who it doesn't affect tho yep you probably guessed it the ai. Like with how long this game been out and with the amount of game updates they did to ""improve"" the ai and the mechanics i shouldnt be bumping into these problems and now they raise the price tag for this game after releasing career mode yea I wouldn't spend the extra money on this game.

UPDATE

Singleplayer used to be alright but slightly one-tone with 1v1's with modifiers being the only option. Career mode, however, is what this game needed. It's an absolute blast to play, the mode is satisfyingly challenging, and the progression is noticeable as you advance. It's a joy to play Career mode, and I come back to it almost daily.

I think the developers are wasting their time on career mode. 

Online H2H is all I care about and in this department this game is horrible at the moment. Lag, Ghost Punches, Spamming Body Blows. Stun stun stun stun stun. Knock down knock down knock down. Its just not good. Weave weave weave. Its more frustrating that it is fun. I have the undisputed belt. I have 200 wins over my losses. Its still not fun. I am not sure if it ever will be. I wish they would scrap the career mode, and have a online career mode only. Scrap the Ai. Invest all of the time and resources into online play. Fighting against the AI is just lame. When you win who honestly cares? Its against the stupid AI. But knocking out another human feels great. But, at the moment it doesn't feel good due to lag, ghost punches, spamming body blows.

The career mode has some neat ideas but the whole ""cutting weight"" part is just absolutely horrid. It isn't evidently clear how much weight you gain or lose from certain activties. The AI also gets ridiculous as you progress to the point where the CPU has higher stats than the player. They're so much faster than you at the same time you're stuck with this messy sluggish movement system.

Like most of you I've been waiting for a Fight Night style boxing game on PC for a long time and I grabbed this as soon as the early access became available. I've played every update, patiently waiting for career mode to drop to make any sort of final decision on this game. Well, career mode is here now, and I had the last 2 days off and played about 10 hours of it and I can tell you honestly that it is ass, and therefore the game is ass. 

For some reason now every loading screen takes 10 times longer than it did before the update. I'm not even talking about loading into fights, like, you go from one menu to another menu and there is a loading screen. Wtf? Career mode essentially boils down to loading 3 or 4 different menu screens (lol) and then doing a quick fight with your character, then repeat. You only gain stats during fight camps, so the goal is to spend as much time in fight camps as possible but even the fight camps are just another menu screen, with loading times. I could forgive a lot of this if the mode was fun or immersive, but it's not. You get like 4 choices for hair and they all look like shit. No physics for hair or your shorts. 1 offbrand boot for every fighter. Everyone looks like an idiot who copped their boxing gear in the walmart sports department and got the same cut from the same lady at supercuts. Why the fuck do I need 50 different sliders for each part of my ear lobe but get 3 bad choices for shorts and 4 bad choices for hair. It just doesn't make any sense. More importantly, the game doesn't scale down to low stat fighters correctly. You're going to be at around 50 for just about every stat when you start, which means you are completely gassed after throwing a 3 punch combo in the first round, which comes out impossibly slow anyway, and most fights will last around 2-3 rounds with both you and your opponent going down and getting up back and forth 2 or 3 times each. It's not boxing. Idk wtf it is but it's not boxing it's nothing like boxing and this mode is trash. Your opponents will be the same so it's not like this makes the game harder it just makes it LESS FUN. Career mode is essentially asking you if you can win fights in slow motion, and your only reward for doing so is to sit through 4 different loading screens for 4 different menu pages, and then do it again. 

Like I said, I've played this game for a year now. You can see that in my hours played. This current version of the game is the most low quality, low budget that the game has ever felt to me. In their effort to release something real and substantial it's become really obvious that this is just not a good game. Everything is sub par. The character creator is trash, the career mode is trash, and after 1 year of updates playing quick fight with a real boxer for a couple of minutes is still the best way to play the game. I don't know if I expected too much of the career mode, that's possible, but in any case this career mode wouldn't be impressive for a game that came out in 2014, nevermind 2024. I love boxing, I love boxing games, so I'll probably keep playing this for no other reason than lack of options, but you have been properly warned: This is a dollar store Fight Night. That's what you are getting here. An altogether worse experience than 10 year old boxing titles. The closer they get to final release the more it falls apart at the seams. They still only have 1 knockdown sequence. Every single knockdown reverts to the exact same count cutscene.

With that being said the career mode and character creation which Ive been waiting on this whole time is highly aggravating. Definitely need more then 4 weeks to train and get your character in fight shape. Idk if its just me or what but even on intermediate Im having issues getting my guy in fight shape. The fights are a struggle if he isnt in shape and since I cant seem to have everything in peak at the same time it takes quite a bit to win the fights and your stamina drains so fast. I enjoy the realism but damn give me some time to train and go through a longer (realistic) fight camp. Like 6-10 weeks or just give us the option to choose how many we want to train for.  Im an amateur kickboxer and I wont even take a fight unless I have 8 weeks at least to train. 
The character creation is okay if you like using sliders. I dont mind them, my character looks quite like me. Once again I know its in early access. Hoping that they might look at reviews and see this.

Movement is still very very choppy and does not feel right.

If you are within jabbing range and throw a straight right hand it does not hit. (which if any of you box you know that your straight right hand reaches further then a jab)

I don't think they have anyone who has ever boxed a day in their life anywhere near the development of the game.

OMG This game has evolved so much. It is way way better now. Damage has now been improved and punches now have impact, IMO, it has already surpassed Fight Night games. Note though that there will be some getting used to with the inertia based movement physics. Hard at first, but once you get used to it, there is just no going back to Fight Night. 

If you are tentative getting this game, I say ""Get it now"". The final build will be very close to this one, and the game will continue getting better with future updates. 

The new experimental camera (similar to Real Boxing and PSP games Rocky Balboa and Victorious Boxers) is something you cannot miss to experience.

OUTDATED REVIEW: Posted: 25 Oct, 2023 @ 12:28pm 

This Early Access game is already beginning to shape up. I have no doubt it is going to be a great boxing game upon completion. There is one glaring issue though: Online.

ONLINE is atrocious. AVOID THIS GAME if this is a deal breaker for you. Players are using only top tier fighters as well as mods to cheat their way to victory. Desync is also an issue as there are no online servers - though this is more of an issue with humanity's primitive internet technology which is still currently just too slow. 

As long as you have couch buddies around to play this with you, thus eliminating the need to play Online, this game can offer many hours of joy and satisfaction.

For now, it's an okay Fight Night clone...which means it is very mediocre gamplay-wise. However, I am still in the hopes that SCI adds unique movesets for each fighter in the game (similar to Hellish Quart). As a matter of fact, it might become the ultimate boxing game if it reaches Tekken levels of depth and complexity upon full release.

Still, it is fairly enjoyable and is getting good over time. My recommendation is to buy it if you are looking for:

- a Fight Night fan who needs a competent boxing game on PC
- looking for something basic and simple
- somewhat realistic stat-based gameplay

Avoid it if you are looking for:

- deep and thoughtful gameplay
- you are looking for an online game. It is simply NOT, and IMO never will be 
- balanced game where player skill determines success. To a certain degree, it can be; however, stats are very meaningful in this game. The higher tier fighters are really OP; whereas the lower tier fighters are really garbage. You can still win as the underdog...against the PC; however, against a decent player, the outcome is most likely already predetermined

In conclusion, BUY IT...but don't expect much. No point being disappointed and complaining in the forums like a beotch. Enjoy the game for what it is.",1698208101,1707854281,True,8,6,0.565964221954345703,0,True,False,True

Swarmer boxers right now just depend on who has the better connection, cause you can't really react if you're the guy who's getting shafted by the netcode.

Offline the game's alright, the AI is a bit cheaty, completely beatable but it's definitely reading inputs they'll react with inhuman speed and precision sometimes and just let you whale on them the rest of the time, granted making a more organic AI is really hard to do. can't wait to see where the game goes but as you can tell by a lot of the reviews it's early access for a reason.

EDIT: had 1 game with decent netcode, had fun, got knocked down by a punch that didn't hit the character but it is what it is. other than that critic still applies... getting extremely tired of the whole getting knocked down without taking the punches thing i can only atribute this to bad netcode or cheating both are equally terrible, also tyson fury is probably the most annoying fighter to face out of everyone in the game due to how the game passively shoves fighters away from eachother, player base barely plays anything other than heavyweight either

Hit a counter power punch with one of the most powerful fighters in the game on a winded opponent no real effect, yep this game is so responsive...

Game is probably in an even worse state after this update. Career mode gets caught in infinite loading screens after update and the one rookie tournament a got to play has no commentary and your hired coach has nothing to say, leading to a dead silent fight with sporadic cheering from the crowd.

My favorite is the guy who complains that it isn't realistic, while complaining that there is stamina, that he can't just stand there and punch non-stop, that he gets KO'ed if he doesn't bother to defend himself or move or stop punching when he has no energy, and that every power punch doesn't guarantee a KO lol.)

Knockout Kings was one of my favorite video game franchises of all time; fond memories of sitting around drinking with a group of friends and having raucous Knockout Kings tournaments. I've been waiting for a worthy successor for a very long time, but there has been a complete lack of good boxing games since that series met its untimely demise. Finally, after all these years, comes Undisputed. 

This is the first boxing game to capture the fun and spirit of Knockout Kings since the glory days of that series. The controls are fun, intuitive, and easy to learn, while also offering enough depth and complexity to lend itself to numerous strategies/ styles and leave room for the hardcore players to master the systems and take their boxing to another level (i assume at least, since i suck and while likely forever remain at suck level).  

There's a pretty decent selection of boxers already, offering a mix of current and past fighter, and there are sure to be many more to come. It already has such greats as Smokin' Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Robinson, Roy Jones Jr, Floyd Patterson, etc etc.

-Career mode is fun, had my first loss by decision, then had a chance to avenge my loss a few fights later and knocked the guy out right at the final bell, advanced a bit higher up the ranks and met him again where he beat me once again by decision, both rematches were intense and my palms were sweating . Career mode has a decent amount of depth to it as well with hiring a coach cut man etc. Would love to see an item shop added to career where i could use in game money to buy stuff for my fighters, shorts gloves tattoos etc

-Create a fighter is good , i love that you can morph face parts and really make some detailed fighters, but its very lacking in hair styles and the tattoo choices and how you apply them is AWFUL...There isnt a single tattoo id want on me in real life and the way you put them on is very limited and they look terrible, hopefully that can be changed up. Also id love to have a community hub where i can download peoples fighters because im not great at creating people. i made butterbean and hes far from butterbean

-Decent music and sound effects, the commentary does a great job reacting to big moments as well, feels like theyre actually watching the fight

-Gameplay has bugs, there was one time i dropped a fighter to his knee and he stood up at the 5 count, but then it cut to me with my hand raised and i definitely shouldnt have won it was the first round and i barely hurt him and he got up quick.

The boxing is very good in my opinion, I cannot just fight every fight the same way and win easily everytime. One of the issues I had with other similar games like Fight Night and UFC is the fights would almost always end with me knocking the person out and almost never go the distance. In this one I am actually having to put in effort if I want to knock the AI out. I love that. 

Now the bad, the commentators are good as far as their acting goes but it very very often does not line up with the action. Knockdowns are almost always called a body shot when most often they are not. A minor issue really but I would love to see the commentary expanded and also line up better with the action. Also another small issue but one that really bothers me is that your created boxer and the random fighters are never announced by name or even nickname. I would like names to be used but at least add nicknames, what is the point of letting us have a nickname without even using it in commentary.

Online Record - 194 wins, 94 losses

+ Career Mode
+ Forward Weaving is fun, and adds an option to close the distance
+ In ring action and mechanics are OK. 

- DESYNC in every other online match
- Still no anticheat
- Players can still disconnect to avoid recording a loss
- A bunch of punches are still exploitable
- Still runs terrible on Steam Deck

Bottom Line: This game had sooooo much potential only to squander it, by not being able to deliver on their roadmap. Several licensed boxers from the marketing reveal are STILL not in game. Desync has been a problem since Day 1. And the outright focus on Career mode, when online play is fundamentally broken leaves me completely disappointed with SCI
 

**Previous Review** - 1 year ago

Best simulation combat sports game on the market. You can tell the devs have a LOVE for the sweet science. It IS Early Access, so please temper your expectations before purchase. 

Pros
+ In-ring action can be very tactical, and true to the sport.
+ Decent assortment of boxers for an Early Access title.
+ Each boxer has their own stance, punches, and movement. (Roy Jones has the double left hook, Canelo's faint into uppercut)

Cons
- Don't expect Steam Deck compatibility right now. Game runs below 30 frames on the Deck at the time of this update.
- Lack of features - As an early access title, I didn't expect a career mode, or the option to create a boxer. But again, it's EARLY ACCESS
- ****RANKED PLAY**** At the moment, if someone quits on you mid match, YOU will receive a loss. This is easily my biggest complaint at the moment, and would like to see this fixed before anything else.",1675301556,1707784165,True,136,5,0.857817709445953369,10,True,False,True

People complain about slow updates but the team is growing, They've doubled their dev team in a year and to anyone who doesn't understand game development that is a BIG deal and to bring all these people up to speed to get out a polished product is not easy at all. The game has some issues but they are sure to be polished over in time, stuttering and AI are my biggest complaints so far since the balancing of the game even on max diff seems to wildly favour the players ability to punch more than the AI so almost every round is a 10-9, to make it challenging the player will have to handicap themselves, i only lost one match down to the game freezing for nearly 10 seconds. Content is very welcome though i will say and some things are being done right and some mechanics are downright impressive,(make the knockout cam just default its a nice feature and give us some new animations because some are mega cheesy stick me in a mo cap suit and i'll do a bunch lol) my next suggestion to the devs however so that the game sells more on steam is MAKE IS PLAYABLE ON KEYBOARD YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR AUDIENCE IE YOUR WALLET. If you people want this game to be good stop giving generic complaints and give constructive feedback because a negative review saying game still bad devs suck (devs have feelings too you know) isnt helpful.
Anyways tho if the devs do see this hi devs, make early builds public for people who want it, recruiting an army of game testers who just want to make the game better and get their hands on new content asap is HEAVILY underrated and the game will benefit because of it.

PROS- decent graphics , if your pc can handle it most of the time will need to be in lower quality to run or the game just freezes your pc 
pretty good starting roster 
good ideas behind it
ai is very good and smart 
similar controls to fight night 
good footwork 

CONS- this whole game 
animations are clunky as hell 
game runs horrible and is not optimized for shit 
game constantly freezes and crashes pc 
screen tearing 
the worst getup system i seen in any boxing game 
clinching is is robotic and not even able to use online 
online runs like your playing on dial up  
input delay 
and many more but ill cut it short 

 in summary this game could have been or may have a chance to be good but in the state its in , its really sad to see , and for anyone hoping for console ports soon ,good like as the game can barley run on pc so consoles are probably out of the question , not to mention for almost the whole period before the games launch steel city were very uncommunicative and radio silent regarding the price of the game , lieing about features and general misinformation about the game . in closing SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BUY THIS GAME !! maybe in the future the game will hopefully be what it wanted be but atm this game aint it so Dont buy the game and if you did your better off refunding it if you can sorry steel city

Great, fluid punch animations and an excellent 1:1 clone of the total punch control system from Fight Night are well-implemented, but there's a lot of work this game needs and at this moment I am not going to recommend it in this state.

Certain things like punches not registering because there's a big enough height difference between boxers that when you throw a punch, it looks like it just bounces or slides off the models and counts as not hitting at all plague this game. There's A LOT of jank with interactions between boxers that needs to be worked out.

Overall though, if the developers stay on track and don't do anything stupid, this'll be a well-polished game in a space that's in desperate need of a game.~~

Unfortunately in my opinion this game lacks a lot in terms of game play and fluidity,  I understand that the physics have been rebuilt from scratch but it feels slow,cumbersome and doesn't have the same snap to it compared to Fight Night Champion.

Fight Night Champion is still a great game to play even now on PS3 or Rpcs3 but lacks a lot within its career mode.

I don't feel that undisputed is an improvement in terms of game play and enjoyability, but makes up for it with better lighting and graphics quality, however i still feel it lacks authenticity in terms of simple things such as the knockdown animations are disappointing and needs a lot of improvement, also the fact that you cannot see the referee in the ring like in Fight night, doesn't make it realistic. Holding is annoying and bizarre as you just see the 2 fighters hugging for 2 minutes instead of animations like the ref breaking the hold or warning fighters etc, this is what this game is lacking a long with the game play aspects.

if we could just have Fight night re released with some tweaks and overhaul of career mode that would by my dream boxing game.

For now i will give this game some time to see if i can adapt to it, but compared to Fight night i do not really enjoy playing this game, because it feels like a chore.",1707744548,1707744548,False,1,0,0.517326712608337402,0,True,False,True

Early access or not, releasing a game that's pretty much online only but with no anti-cheat means it's basically unplayable. Edit: I've now played about 300 hours or so and can say the gameplay has marginally improved in some areas and regressed in others. Cheaters are still here, but not as many, purely because the player base has shrunk so much. Lag might actually be worse.

Better foot work offensively.  Some boxers can dash in and cut off their opponent with foot speed. Pacquiao and Bivol does this.

-Short boxers arms shouldn't have ""stretch out animation"" to connect with the other boxer. They should have execellent foot work if they're gonna dash in taller fighters. UFC short fighters' height gets stretch out to match the taller fighters. Let's not have that in this boxing game.

- Less scripting on the AI. In all EA sports games, their AI completely predicted human's moves. It felt fighting an AI. Instead, make the AI commit to a strategy and make a mistake. Make it like a chess play, but make AI punish for taking risky moves.


- More damage animation. In Fight Night, I'd jabbed my opponents to death for 3 rounds. And their nose would bleed and bruised heavily. In this game, their face was still clean after landing lots of jabs. I need to feel like I damaged the opponent, as if it's a human being. Not an AI.

- Fighters Wishlist: Bivol, Tank Davis, Kambosos, Devin Henley, Errol Spence, Tim Bradley, Mayweather, Pacquiao, Rigondeaux, Hopkins.

Please get Dimitri Bivol in this game. Again, don't let Canelo's arms stretched when he fights Tall opponents. His arm size should remain the same, but his foot work should able to dash in to reach Bivol. 

But again, Canelo doesn't really have fast work anyways.

- Roy Jones shoulder roll feels like James Toney.  Roy's relied on his reaction for defense than curling up tightly with his shoulder roll. 

- If Tank Davis and Pacquiao comes in, hope they have unique awkward angles, and great foot work.  

- Pretty Boy Mayweather version is more aggressive, while Money Mayweather is defensive more.


What I love about the game:
Developers for Undisputed are passionate boxing fans. That's what EA sports is missing these days. They're just developers that don't watch sports. Fight Night was made with passionate boxing fans. But those were the old days.

i can sense the passion in Undisputed, and there'll be improvements to come. That's why I'm supporting this game.

Game is fun. Punching and counter punching feels great but not perfect. It's still worth investing in this game now.",1707361475,1707361475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

best comparison is back on X360 when the ufc2 demo only let you use 2 characters and you didnt even want to play one of them and youre dying to punch another human in the face but this is the next best thing available for a 9 year old in 2008. this game is the same thing.",1707263229,1707263229,False,7,0,0.591524600982666016,0,True,False,True

Feints are broken, with certain boxers the mechanic doesn't even work.and sends your boxer running backwards and you cant control them. They actually thought that binding feints to the d-pad was a good idea. If you power left hook feint it also breaks your boxer. People complain about spamming but its honestly the only way to get a knockout, and not just online. Even against undiputed lvl cpus, hook spamming is the most effective way to score a knockout unless you want to decision the cpu every fight.

The counter fighting is outright terrible, and its incredibly difficult to hurt your opponent with a good counter. The head movement is jerky and just feels bad to do. Punch tracking/auto alignment feels awful, and leads to southpaws feeling like garbage to play because their strikes never seem to track correctly and you spend far more time hitting air when the shots clearly should have landed. The stamina systems is either bugged or doesnt work as intended, missing shots are so incredibly penalized that 3-4 missed shots with leave you at a permanent stamina disadvantage. There is now rolling mechanic whatsoever and compared to games like fight night champion (a product over a decade old) feels like you have far more control over your boxers movement. and to top it all off, the multiplayer feels terrible to play, even when your fighting someone with good ping. the massive desync issues makes online unplayable and the devs have essentially done nothing to fix it since launch.

As it stands, i cannot possibly reccomend undisputed, its a laughable shell of a boxing game that seems to miss every single mark mechanically. They started with an obviously lofty goal of making a competitive simulation boxing game, but they are so far off the mark it feels like the devs are rushing the product out the door. With the career mode update around the corner with no real changes to gameplay, it feels like the devs are looking for one last update before they push it into a lazy 1.0 release. the game is far from done, and its clear to many who've been watching from the sidelines that the devs are trying to push the game out and be done with it.",1693094953,1707158233,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Damage system is laughable, ive seen much more dynamic and realistic damage on ps2 games, im serious.

You always come off worse in this game, you can land 10 absolutely sweet right hook haymakers in a row and you are instantly on the back foot for the rest of the fight, you will never recover from the beating you just gave your opponent while he will be fresh and ready to go, that's how unbelievably bad the stamina system is. If you play this game like a videogame it just wont work, if you play this game like its a real life boxing match it just wont work... i think they expect you to throw a one two combo then sit back and just move around for 10 seconds, don't you dare attempt to throw 4 or 5 in a row, it wont matter how many of those shots land clean you are always the one worse off because you threw punches and the other guy didn't so hes winning, his stamina will always be ahead.

My fingers are crossed for the updates and ill check them out but this right now is one of the most unsatisfying boxing games ive ever played. Boxers move slow, punches have no snap at all, if you run out of stamina they punch in slow motion, damage... what damage? if you manage to land 3000 punches to one section of the opponents face you might see a cut, you might, but you will be on the brink of death with enough stamina to throw 1 punch every 10 seconds so there is that.

I have 550hrs in on this game and 400hrs of streaming it. Of those 600 fights, around 561 of them were unbeatable cheaters  and spammers who the developers have not only allowed to exist, but promoted by ensuring anyone who doesnt support their victories is punished with ""low priority"" messages.
 I am going to spell this out nicely because these are without a doubt the worst developers I have seen in over 30 years of what most would consider a veteran elite gamer. These developers have ignored every single issue complained on Steam, Discord, and even their own feedback created to help troubleshoot and identify cheating boxers. THey ignore everything you send or anyone asks. Look at Reddit, look at Discord, look at Steam reviews in the last 6 months. It is overwhelmingly negative even though currently it is showing mixed thanks to their tactics to cheat (imagine that) by hiring the company I work for to post thousands of positives to blend it back up. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
 The main issue is cheating spamming and innefective blocks which confuse the already broken scoring system. ALL players you will fight will automatically win 50% of the rounds. They will have super-human strength able to bypass all blocks and knock you out with just a couple punches in a couple of seconds at will. They not only have super human stamina, but they can deplete yours ruining the fight before the first scorecards come out at round 4. 
 Even if you just want to play against the stupid easy AI in singleplayer I would still say no. #1 because there is no campaign, no training system, and no scoring system.  To make it even worse you would be supporting a company who supports and promotes stealing rounds by encouraging cheating others in a competitive sport. OVerall 1 of 10 and I am fighting to get my money back.
 This is the first bad review I have had to write and I could not say enough horrible things folks. Let this company fail until someone else picks it up. They stand no chance !


So today, 6 months after I wrote my last review I can say with certainty this game is complete trash.  The boxing mechanics are every bit as broken as day one, and many players argue worse. The two basic fundamentals in boxing are punching and blocking. If you choose a top 3-4 boxer you get a free pass to bypass every block in the game, Ali slaps you and can keep you dazed  from a rookie skill player against a veteran player. Frazier can let about 12 left hooks loose in under a second,  and Fury will just overhand right straight through every block until you are broken. Not to mention all of these players blocking works great against the other 85% of fighters so everyone uses just 3 people with the exception of Wilders lighting fast OP overhand. 
 Main points :
 - Nobody boxes. Instead they just spam power through blocks.
 - The lobbies are full and I mean FULL of cheaters as this company doesn't believe in anti-cheat software
 - The company has never once addressed a single issue and only continues to release new content ignoring the community. 
 - The types of people you fight are the type of people who enjoy exploitation with celebration. 
 - BEst of all the desync and connection is so damn bad you miss half the punches landed on you confusing the fight, and there is not a single fighter in the entire community who doesn't have at least a 5-1 winning record. Let that sink for a second. This was Day 1 beta, and is today Steel City Development proud to announce Full game status and completion....lol

SCI has put together a heavy roster of professional boxers that puts past boxing games to shame only leaving out some notable greats along with some too expensive to negotiate with.  It's the first boxing game since Fight Night Champion to offer a competitive and realistic boxing experience to rival and in ways surpass Fight Night Champion.  All isn't smiles and hallmark cards however as the new studio seems to have undertaken too difficult a task as evidenced by very poor developer feedback and community engagement during early access.  

Gameplay Offline PVP: This mode is pretty good through either Steam Remote Play or Parsec.  The mechanics all work much better than online and it offers a relatively competitive experience. The movement is pretty solid with some interesting motion capture of realistic boxer movements that makes the game appear less float-like as seen in most boxing and MMA games.  However the ""loose movement"" isn't really individualized to boxers and that is a limitation that I wished made progress during the project's early access.  The boxers that are lower rated than the higher rated fighters don't have much chance of winning.  While this seems like an obvious statement, one only needs to think of games like Tekken and Virtua Fighter where a great player could use a low tier fighter to outclass a moderately skilled opponent using an S tier fighter.  This isn't to say there is no chance to win, it's just much more limited.  

Probably the biggest downfall of the gameplay is the lack of a well developed countering system.  There is no ""perfect block"" or way to really parry that makes sense.  The counters that do occur have the longest counter window and it really makes it confusing to understand why it was triggered in the first place.  The studio had a very strong early preview of a blocking system that sadly got abandoned when it hit early access.  The game planned to have distinct blocking zones which would have made sense to have good counter punching opportunities upon successfully anticipating the correct blocking zone.  This didn't materialize and the blocking is essentially blocking high and low.  Simulation blocking is found in a different mode but it only gives unique blocking animations despite not doing anything mechanically different than regular blocking which just looks odd since it didn't get further developed.  

Online netcode:  Whatever they are using is terrible.  It's somewhat serviceable if the connections are good.  The studio promised they were working with expert third party developers to fix their networking solutions and will provide an Anti-cheat.  Over a year later, it did not materialize.  As of this writing, the final content update is coming on 2-12-24 which makes these features very unlikely to make their way to the game before it ships as they stopped talking about it.  

The Ai:  I thought the initial Ai was most performant.  It has been a very rough journey for the Ai over the course of this last year and the Ai currently is in a bad state.  It really begs the question how they developed the Ai and given it's 2024 it's hard to think they didn't use some form of ML and training from all our user data.  Speaking of user data, the December 2023 patch now omits the option of refusing to consent to the data collection methods which is odd.  There is also no language anywhere in the game's reading that identifies what they collect and use and if it is GDPR compliant for European Countries.  This could be problematic if people do look into this and find fault as it is this authors understanding that EVERYONE must be notified and consent to this in an EULA.  

Overall the game is OK but it has NOT progressed much in the past year.  Some would argue the game played better prior to Early Access release in the Open Betas.  I'm not sure if I would go that far as it usually is a case of rose colored glasses.  However many of the missing and unfinished mechanics are still absent in the game.  The ref has yet to make it to the ring, the ability to clinch, career mode and further animation work to the ring walks, ring celebrations and voice work during the match.  What once was a good foundation upon release is now feeling very bare bones and looking like a rush job and mismanaged project.  The studio grew exponentially before this game ever released but it has many licensing deals and outside investors and that just stripped the passion away from the project.  It's really too bad what happened with this project.  

I was so excited to hear about this game and completely nerded out to it to the point where early on I was considering switching careers to work with a company like SCI and be a part of this exciting industry; especially a boxing focused studio.  The lack of proper community engagement and communication in general was off putting and in my strong opinion completely avoidable.  It's difficult to not think if  I did work on the project I could have at least really set the proper tone with the communities on discord, steam forums, reddit and other social apps.  

There are a lot of criticisms in this current iteration of the review but they are accurate to consider.  I still will play and enjoy the game the best I can and it's not a failed attempt.  It's a good game with a moderate learning curve with a low skill ceiling.  Here's to hoping they get it right next time or another challenger enters the lobby to compete so to speak! 

Final Score: 6/10.  I anticipate a career mode that will likely make many people upset as it will lack animation and voice acting begging the question why it took over a year to deploy. It's a buy recommendation if you are a boxing fan without high expectations and pay the current price of 29.99.  I don't think it is worth more.  If the studio was more transparent during the process and didn't feel like they just turned completely corporate without the passion they once displayed I would recommend it based on the score.",1675620703,1706844655,False,0,0,0.54666668176651001,40,True,False,True

Those are the two biggest issues. I can't tell you how many times I've been dropped by a punch that missed by a few FEET. One of my favorite boxers to use is Larry Holmes. He is a distance fighter. It makes it pointless to try and fight with him the intended way because I'm still getting rocked with straight punches and hooks from people like Deontay Wilder who should be missing 90% of the time. I can't tire out a big puncher and get him in the later rounds if he's hitting me when he should be missing because I'm obviously out of range for him to land. It's not just Deontay Wilder, that's just one example I wanted to use because you can't afford to take extra punches that shouldn't be landing from someone like him. Plus, if by some small chance you happen to have a fight that's working properly, it will still get disconnected. THESE ARE THE ISSUES YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON! Not career mode and create a fighter.

This game: A sort of Open-beta promising product that may become a top-notch contact sports simulator

What is good about Undisputed:
- The attempts to reproduce a boxing match feeling legitimate
- The models and faces are at a satisfactory level of quality
- It is the only boxing game we can currently take seriously
- It can work just fine with lower settings than the minimum recommended if you go cheap on settings
- It is worth purchasing because it's mildly fun and extremely promising
- The ""simulation"" mode feels far more satisfying than the ""casual"" mode

What is bad about Undisputed:
- The stamina system is a disaster at 1.0 multiplier
- The damage done at 1.0 is unrealistically low
- The knockdown minigame is a bad feature that should be changed ASAP
- The covering during guard does not leave any natural openings (two hands in a real boxing match may be blocking one high and one low with obvious potential guard penetration. In here you block whether both tops or both bottoms with zero guard penetration)
- The idea of having a headbutt as an option isn't a great idea

What could be better about Undisputed:
- The natural boxing match feeling you get would be at probably 0.25 to 0.33 Stamina drain currently and 2.0 to 2.25 damage multiplier. Anything else is probably too hardcore or too arcade.
- The minigame from the KD needs to be changed ASAP. Replace it with a timed locking-in input for both triggers that can be done far easier on the first knockdown and gradually gets more difficult with each successive knockdown.
- Adding more boxers (limited by legal and financial) like GGG and Mike Tyson would add greatly to the experience
- Optimizing the open arenas also would make the experience far better for the people who didn't invest 3000 dollars in a computer
- Focusing on making the career and create-your-own-boxer features will make this game feel complete

Parting remarks:
This is a very promising game and I've purchased it as a gesture of support towards creating high quality contact sports simulators. I got it on a discount at 22.50 euros. The game does not feel like a game ready to be sold for some but it's worth purchasing it now since it will be greatly better when it's done.
Trying to copy the silly logic found in EA's UFC games with stamina bars and recovering damage bars is a risky business. EA UFC games are terrible on the striking part because of the same issues. The stamina drains too fast and the damage is done way too slow. Defense doesn't feel realistic and a feeling of randomness over fighting skill draws a huge shadow over the user satisfaction.

I'm confident that this game will be a great product that will be played for the next 15 years if the right decisions are done to keep this game alive and implement the right things instead of listening to couch potatoes and marketing specialists over former boxing enthusiasts, fighting sports afficionados or gaming industry competent/educated opinions.

First, I played a mountain of Fight Night 3/4 as a kid and I had high hopes that Undisputed would have similarities, and while there's certain similarities, it's also 15 years later.  I feel like Undisputed should be blowing those older titles away in advancements.  It's plainly not. 

In FNR3/4, I used to enjoy pot-shotting at range because the mechanics really allowed you to stick and move.
The movement and transition between punching and moving is a lot less fluid in Undisputed.  The combinations are a lot slower too and it overall just feels less complete.

There's some things, like career, creator and corner work between rounds, that I imagine may be implemented with future updates (we are a year on from release though, tbh).
One thing that is blatantly missing though, and I really can't look past, is the overpowered effectiveness of body shots.
When you catch a guy to the body, he'll be hesitant to relax his core and diaphragm for a little while, effecting his breathing substantially.  When you land consistently to the body, you essentially begin to suffocate the opponent, which is absolutely debilitating throughout the later rounds.

In undisputed, you've got head damage and body damage.  Body shots really need to drain the opponent's stamina bar.

Being behind in areas that were nailed by other games 15-20 years ago, just doesn't scream brilliance.",1706608166,1706608166,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Here I am, on January 29th, attempting to extract some enjoyment out of the same clunky mess I payed for on launch.

I know what you're thinking: ""I don't need career mode! I just want to have fun fighting the CPU!""

Good luck with that, have your dog chew on a 2nd controller and you will have a better match.

""But wait!!! They just patched the AI!!! This guy is old news!!!""

This is nearly the 10th useless AI hotfix with molecular changes. Dust off the 360 and load up Fight Night.

If you really love boxing against the CPU then you might enjoy this on sale, however multiplayer is still not a good experience. It has improved since my last review, but at a snails pace, and still has not delivered on promised timetables and content. Re-revised4.5//10

I have held out hope for this game for a long time. I have actively defended it and SCI for being a small dev who deserves time to put out a product. I am here to tell you this is all in vain. This game is a trap, no other way to put it. This dev has had time and shown next to nothing for it. This game has been overpromised and underdelivered to no end. 

There is no other decent boxing game for PC and SCI knows that, they will take your money gladly while promising the world, and using your money for promotional materials to get more money. They would rather pay Youtubers to put out the good word than actually have a good game. They cant keep to their timetables, cant keep their promises, and in my opinion shouldnt be creating games, its that simple.

[strike] As for the game itself its fine. Maybe 5.5/10. Constant buggy issues, terrible netplay, and a fraction of the fighters promised gives this game a very short life for those who aren't boxing fans. [/strike] 

Here are a few very common and very annoying issues:
-Uppercut spam: Seems like a simple solution, back up, but they have much more range than they should

-Backstep straight spam: This is just mindblowing. Im glad this exists as an option but it should be nowhere near as damaging as it is. Even with the nerfs its just stupid powerful for long armed fighters

Fixed: [strike]-Cameraman on edge of ring:Like are you serious? Seems apparent that no one plays the game at SCI or they would have noticed this fight 1[/strike]

-Buggy punch tracking: Punches might miss for apparently no reason. This has improved somewhat with a few of the fighters on the roster but is still very prevalent with others.

Improved tremendously:[strike]-Odd movement: The game has very fluid movement compared to older boxing games but yet it almost always feels buggy and unrefined. You can never take advantage of the more fluid movement because it just doesnt work. You will end up dodging when you dont mean to, and find yourself doing side step dodges when you just want to take a single step. The footwork was promoted as being one of the biggest pros to this game and it falls wayyyy short. They only just recently added diagonal dodges making infighting a bit more possible but without any improvements to footwork the game will never improve much.[/strike] 

-Fighter taunts: Small issue, but all fighters have the same taunts. They were able to put in fighter specific animations but the entire roster taunts the exact same. No effort was put into it, and while its not even near the top of the to do list, it just helps paint the lowly detailed picture that SCI is painting.

Half fixed?[strike]-No instant replay: Again shows lack of effort. I cant wrap my head around why fighting games do not offer this. Both this and the UFC series lack what almost every other EA franchise has as an afterthought. Both deserve points taken off, but again not on the top of the to do list.[/strike] There is now an experimental instant replay that plays after a knockdown, but you have very little control in this mode. Certainly an improvement, just not ideal.

-General lack of content: Do you enjoy fighting all time greats like me? Ali and Frazier? RJJ and Calzaghe? Well you can! As much as you want! Until you realize that its the same fight over and over because the AI does the same thing over and over. It gets old fast, and even on undisputed difficulty the AI is a breeze. The only content that is ever updated are the prize fights, and again its just fighters that are already on the roster fighting one another. You might be given a fairly decent disadvantage against an undisputed AI but it doesnt count for anything because its just a quick play fight where the characters were chosen for you.

Addition: Fighters are continuously added, but its not near what they promised yet.

 In order to keep interest they announced career mode was finally coming and have yet to even update the community on it at all. While the mode does look like a HUGE content addition to what we have in the game, it does feel like the lynchpin feature. As in, if it doesnt capture the entire gaming world it is only delaying the inevitable failure that this game is heading towards. 

At time of edit career mode is still not released, game feels very limited, especially with how poor the netplay is due to lag and cheaters.

I truly want this game to be the best boxing sim on the market but I would be flat out lying to everyone if I said this was finished. Don't waste your time and money until this game makes it big or more likely fizzles out.",1699897051,1706495862,False,128,2,0.835927128791809082,0,True,False,True

This game plays like fight night, but also plays nothing like it at the same time. The core mechanics are there but they are way too slow. The ability to bob and weave would be great if it actually worked, i found the easiest way to dodge is to just spam up and down on the stick, because weaving and leaning is absolutely useless.

I've had maybe 10-15 quick fights and never once have i been able to stagger or daze, every timed counter i land does nothing, but when the same timed counters hit me i am staggered every time (unbalanced much?)

Getting to your feet after being knocked down, that mechanic is atrocious.  Unless you have exotropia you will just about get up once. It should have been something similar to fight night.

Opponents never seem to lose stamina regardless of how many punches they throw or how many body shots are landed.

The way the boxers look and move in the ring is absolutely spot on, no faults there.

I'd love to recommend the game because i know there is a lot of passion going into this and if it's done right could top fight night, but in it's current state with laggy and unresponsive mechanics i can't recommend it yet. My review may change with future updates.

They are still good and feel good to use but the execution is lacking completely. There are moments where you will be halfway across the ring and your opponent is still tapping you, THROUGH your guard. Or moments where you will be pulling off a sick combo only for the game to lag and your opponent has somehow put your health into red in that half a second it take the game to catch up. This can be infuriating especially playing ranked. My record thus far is 44-6-1. 5 out of those 6 losses were due to horrible connection issues (which is pretty much every game) or just buggy jank that still needs to get polished out by the devs. The new update completely overhauled the physical damage and the visibility of it as well. I must say it feels a world better than when I first started playing. 
I would say if you are looking to purchase this game, and you really enjoy boxing games with ""Fight Night"" type mechanics, then I would say go for it. Keep in mind the online right now is just to unstable to recommend to new players. They will be releasing career mode any day now and this game will be MUCH better for it. Until they figure out connectivity issues I would stick to either quick matches and play local with a friend or AI. At the very least I would stay away from ranked play if you are looking to play online. 
Overall 7.5/10. The mechanics make it very enjoyable and immersive to play. The characters are spongy but so are they in every boxing game, although they do have a setting for damage multiplier when in fights which is nice. The graphics look great and it runs great on my RTX 3070 and R75800x combo. With all that in mind I just can't go above a 7.5 for this EARLY ACCESS game.

Rank: Undisputed [170-49 [Rank 41])

I've changed my Review from Positive to Negative and back again 10 times, which should tell you something.  It's an abusive love/hate relationship that I should get out of, but can't leave because I'm dependent and there's nowhere else to go.

When it's played earnestly, it feels fantastic.  When it's mechanically abused, it's the most frustrating game I've ever played, and even winning 95% of my fights is a miserable experience.

Undisputed is a passion project from small and new developers who are deeply invested, are trying their best to listen to the community, and are making mostly good decisions and necessary changes to the game, but their lack of previous experience can't help but be felt.  The game has the potential be the best boxing game ever made, however there are currently a TON of things so frustrating about it that I have a hard time keeping it installed.  Even when I win (which is nearly always), I rarely have any fun.

PROBLEM: DESYNC  (Due to Pier to Pier Connections)
Phantom Punches, 15 minute queue times for 90 second DC matches, and oh so much more are almost a given in every fight.  It's a miracle when you get a fight that holds for 12 Rounds.  It sucks having to keep your guard up even when your opponent is across the ring because on his screen he might be right on top of you landing blows that you can't see.  Pier to Pier has also opened the door for legitimate cheaters who can knock you down in one punch while having infinite stamina.

SOLUTION: Get your own Servers and implement some level of Anti-Cheat asap.

PROBLEM: PUNCH ACCURACY
The miss rate is absolutely ridiculous when a Fighter is circling you.  It has created a coward Meta where running away and staying on your back foot makes the opponent miss nearly every shots  This sucks all the more because 2 of the 3 Judges seem to exclusively score for Accuracy.  More than once have I lost a 12 Round Split Decisions against skill-less players, who I've hit at least TWO HUNDRED TIME MORE with only 2% less accuracy.  There is always only one of three judge who scores something like 117 > 111 in my favor for chasing a spineless coward around for 12 Rounds and beating the living shit out of them at the cost of a 2% accuracy difference.  It has also created a counter meta where players just spam lead uppercuts to the body because it's the only punch that will land against this abused mechanic.  Abuse propagating more abuse.

SOLUTION: Make your punches more accurate.  Sometimes they don't feel like they ever had any intention of hitting anything other than an invisible chandelier overhead or some heckler in the back row of the bleachers.  This is especially noticeable with Roy Jones Jr.  Also, have fighter avatars adjust their posture and positioning to face circling opponents more intelligently and effectively.

Despite it all, I'm one of the best in the world and truly love (and hate) Undisputed.

You should probably still get it if you've been waiting for a decade like me.  I don't regret having it in my Library, but when I die young from a heart attack this game will be to blame.

___________________________________

CHANGES I'D LIKE TO SEE

Remove the 25 Health Minimum.  I'll often beat the living daylights out of somebody and have them down to 25 health by round 5.  It really sucks to be at 90 HP while they're 25, then next round hit them 50 times to 10, now it's 85 to 25.  Next round hit them 50 to 10 and now it's 75 to 25, and so on until it's 25 to 25 and I've hit them literally 300 times more.

There must be more ways to initiate a Stun State.  Basically the only way to stagger somebody into a knockdown potential state is to land a decently mixed head combo.  This makes it so that the game is 100% about hand speed.  Taking 4 power shots to the brain from SRR loses every time to 6 rapid hooks from Amir Khan.  It also doesn't matter if it's the first 10 punches of the fight, or if it's the 12th Round and they've been hit hundreds of times.  It still feels like it take the exact same amount of punches landed to initiate a knockdown chance.  This makes it so keeping your hands up the entire match will pretty much NEVER allow for staggers.  Step out of the pocket after taking 1 or 2 punches and you'll NEVER get staggered, even if you're getting absolutely pummeled overall.  If punches aren't landed creatively and in rapid succession, it literally doesn't matter how many times you hit them, or how hard your punches are.  It also doesn't matter if they have 100HP or 25 HP.  It takes the exact same head combo to stagger and it pisses me off.  Power punches are worthless for knockdowns and it's purely about quick volume.

Speaking of knockdowns, make the difficulty of the ""Get Up Game"" relative to the amount of damage taken.  The mini game gets progressively harder with each knockdown, but it doesn't matter when in the fight those knockdowns come.  If you finally hit the floor after 12 Rounds of getting your ass kicked, you still get the easiest First Knockdown mini game and are essentially guaranteed to get up if you at all know how to play it.  I would love to see difficulty of the mini-game increase according to damage taken and relative to the punch(es) that put them on the canvas.

Throwing 900+ punches and having 100 Stamina after 12 Rounds.
Once you understand that your max Stamina ONLY goes down from having additional Stamina drain after about the 60% mark, you can do whatever you want and keep 100 Stamina through the entire fight.  Body work literally doesn't matter unless you're landing those body shots AFTER they're below 60%.  Throwing tons of huge Power Punches or whiffing multitudes of combinations doesn't matter either, so long as you don't keep punching (or take any body punches) past the 60% mark.  If you never allow yourself to be drained past 60%, no amount of received body damage or self exhaustion matters in the slightest.

Related to that, landing Power Punches to an opponents body is basically useless (for draining their stamina), as you drain your own stamina by throwing them more than you affect theirs by landing them.  This is also true with Power Punches to the head.  You won't ever stagger them from landing huge punches (as a combo is the only way to stagger), but you certainly will drain yourself if you keep them up.

Make the time between Rounds 30 seconds.  I get that you're going for realism, but the 60 second timer has become a way for trolls to punish players who are beating them.  I can't tell you how many times I've been absolutely pummeling somebody and been punished for it by having 12 full minutes of my life siphoned away because it's the only punch they can land.  It REALLY sucks to be punished like this for being the better player, and having them click the ""skip"" button with 1 second left on the clock the entire fight makes me want to commit acts of violence.  By making it 30 seconds at least the most amount of life some chud can take away from me is 6 minutes.  I think this should especially be done since default play is 1.5x time so you don't have a true 3 minute round either.  With 1.5x Round time a fight can only go as long as 18 minutes, and sitting around twiddling my thumbs while a chump tries to frustrate me into quitting for 12 Rounds squanders nearly as much breath as a full 12 Rounder.",1675208452,1706060905,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros - Graphics are decent for a smaller publisher (is some bottle necking with the game on RTX GPU's) Reason I'm not saying they look Ultra great is some shadowing is a bit wonky and colors look odd like gold around noses. The fighting is for what you can play (not everything is out yet) really fun very similar to Fight Night Round 3/Champions. The music is decent for background music but nothing like a real fight Anthem like we got in Fight Knight, still not as annoying as the horrible attempt at a creed boxing game. Motion is fluid and ducking and dodge seem really on par. The Tutorial is decent it gives you exactly what you need to know to step in the ring.

Cons - My son is 8 and really wanted to play but there is no difficulty settings to make it a bit easier for him to play so he got worked, got pissed and lost interest. No career mode (coming sometime) Online is not quite there IMO people are cry babies and if they start losing they just quit the fight and you get no win and they do not take an L. Servers are sluggish and there is no difficulty for online either so you can get paired up with a dude is 12-0 and your 4-4 and IMO that's not on par with the ranking you are. I had a guy dead to rights with an uppercut hit him dead on and it did nothing he did not dodge or block he took a power F*** You type punch and did not register as a hit, it seems to do that more then it should. Bugs and more bugs but again early access so bugs are to be expected.

In closing I see potential here I see Devs put in a lot of love to whats there so far. I am a fair guy when I review a game I would say this. If your looking for a complete Boxing game with features that Rival Fight Night this game could be for you, but atm it's not there yet. A list of things below I would hope to see coming in future patches.

1. Allow a AI or Difficulty adjustment in settings so younger kids can play (I have 2 sons that would like to)
2. Some of the fighters in game atm are way too hard so again some kind of adjustment
3. Dlss 3.0 and true Ray tracing 
4. Punches actually when landed do the correct damage
5. Online matching closer to people around your W/L ratio 

I cant speak on career mode as to what is there or lacking atm since it's not in the game I feel that is the biggest feature people want so hoping it does not take them long to get it into the game.


***Update 2024****
I'm giving it until March before I change my thumbs to down since there used to be a road map for the game and it all since Nov 2023 has been removed. In that Road map it said (End of 2023 Career Mode) and here it is end of Jan 2024 no career mode, no update on a timeline no new road map, nothing. They keep saying AI fixes yet I have yet to see any real improvements to it. There still is no AI slider, punches are still not registering right and still have no real answer to matchmaking as my latest fight (31-7) went against (149-2) and dude had to be cheating cause he knocked me Da FAQ out in 20 seconds... 

Will update come End of March if nothing has been changed or new new Road map I feel a lot of us been waiting and waiting will not be around much longer since a new Boxing game was just announced and it will ship day 1 with Career mode and over 200+ boxers from history.",1675485098,1705965648,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Even on fast connections, hits and blocks do not sync up and animations are inaccurate. Don't even try to play this game if your connection is slower; if you do, get used to being hit by players from the other side of the ring. 

The game still has no career mode to speak of. Online play is no longer atrocious now, just lackluster and inconsistent.

These games is damn near unplayable now 🤬😡
Now, how do I know all of this? 🤔
Well, I watch YouTube videos about it then 
I bought the mod just to see what all of my OPPS were doing to beat me and so I could also activate the features as well to counter there’s whenever I matched against a cheater and stop 🛑 them from draining all of my stamina when I threw one punch while I had “Infinite Stamina” activated and they still knocked me down very fast while I had “Unlimited Health” activated!
I even tried to use the “Player Always The Winner” feature to be able to counter them getting a W for cheating and KOing me in the 1st round because of all of the boost that they had that I previously mentioned but I still wasn’t successful.
Almost ever player that I play online is using a mod the last time a played the game which was today 🤦🏾‍♂️ and you may match up against that same player over and over.
Records don’t mean anything because most of them who have great records are the cheaters.
Players in competitive gaming rather cheat by doing glitches or doing stuff that’s much worse just to seem like winners because they are use to losing in everything else in their LIVES 😂
Nobody wants to be LOSERS even if that’s who they truly are!

In the world of virtual pugilism, expectations soar with every new release, especially when it's a successor to a beloved franchise. As a seasoned fight fan, my enthusiasm for Undisputed was sky-high, fueled by the promise of advanced technology and lessons learned from past missteps in the genre. However, after spending ample time in its digital ring, I'm left with a profound sense of disappointment - a sentiment I never anticipated.

Let's start with the core of any fighting game: the mechanics. In a genre where precision and responsiveness are king, Undisputed falls surprisingly short. The movement feels sluggish, lacking the fluidity and responsiveness that made its predecessor, Fight Night Champion, a standout. This deficiency becomes painfully apparent in the dodging and slipping mechanics, which are integral to the dance of boxing. In Fight Night Champion, each weave and duck felt intuitive, a ballet of brutality. In contrast, Undisputed feels like wading through molasses, with each movement lacking the finesse and sharpness expected in a top-tier fighting game.

The punching mechanics, the very essence of a boxing game, are equally underwhelming. There's a certain weightlessness to the blows, a disconnection that makes each punch feel like it's slicing through air rather than making impactful contact. This issue is exacerbated by the game's lackluster collision detection. In a sport where the impact of a single punch can turn the tide, the lack of tactile feedback in Undisputed is a glaring oversight.

But the problems don't stop there. The physics engine, another crucial component, seems to have taken a step back. The punches lack the crispness and visual impact you'd expect. Instead, they come across as floaty and disjointed, stripping away the raw, visceral thrill that boxing games usually deliver.

Above all, the overall experience feels like a missed opportunity. The game comes across as a cash grab rather than a genuine effort to push the genre forward. It's disheartening to see a studio, with a clear roadmap of what not to do from Fight Night Champion's shortcomings, still stumble in delivering a compelling boxing experience.

In conclusion, Undisputed fails to live up to its legacy. It's a stark reminder that advancements in technology alone can't compensate for a lack of polish and attention to the fundamentals that make a fighting game great. For now, I find myself returning to Fight Night Champion, a testament to what this genre can be when done right. Undisputed could have been a contender but instead, it's a mere shadow of what fight fans truly deserve.",1677899319,1705864488,False,2,0,0.48750266432762146,0,True,False,True

It's so much better. I'm hoping there isn't' too many negative reviews from people not understanding to early access concept. This is an alpha? would we all agree? after getting to grips with it and learning the head movement and angled punches i have to say this is great. I was put off at first  because i was spamming or couldn't connect properly.

If they update it frequently (now they have some more funding) this will be a game ill play for ever. For a small team of devs fair play i didn't think  we would get to this day after a while , but now its here. If this games tint in early  access is done properly it will be a classic.

Bad mistake.
Before anyone asks, my computer hardware sits right in the middle between minimum and high recommendations.
That has not been an issue until this game.

I don't know if it is coincidence or not but once this game was installed my computer/steam went sideways when it came to running any games.

Games would slow right down or even freeze, if they even opened at all.
Once uninstalled, things have since returned to normal.

Having said that, i did manage to get through the training tutorials.
I found things to run fairly smoothly. Game mechanics were fairly intuitive.
Unfortunately not everything wants in a game is available yet. (Not everyone wants to play online all the time).
So once a the career mode is incorporated into the game, there should be more options.

The game failed me when i went to set up the very first match... ... ... ... yes waiting and waiting for it to load.
Once loaded it began stuttering and then froze my whole computer--not just the game and steam.

I can only assume that my computer is one of few that ran into issues with the game. Hopefully that is it and not something else.

Graphically the game looks great, and the gameplay mechanics are pretty simple and straightforward. In its current state, it plays similar to EA's fight night, which isn't a bad thing. The boxer models are well done, and look very spot on to their in comparison to their real counterpart. Even the taunts are reminiscent of the actual boxers. Which is a nice touch. 

However, keep in mind it's an early access game, so with that being said, the game still feels underdeveloped in certain aspects such as the venue choices. Need to showcase more boxers throughout the various years and weight class. Especially those from the golden years of boxing such as De la Hoya, Lenox Lewis, M. Tyson, Bernard Hopkins, Hagler, T. Hearns, G. Foreman, L. Holmes, Frazer, E. Holyfield, S. Liston, M. Cotton, R. Hatton, J. Calzaghe, M. Pacquiao, F. Mayweather, S. Mosley and more. 
Also  I would like to see more boxing physics involving the ring's ropes. For instance: when your boxer is leaning against the ropes after taking numerous hits. Whether he's learning against the ropes from fatigue, or getting weak in the knees from body blows, or getting bounces off the ropes from a skull rattling punch. It's a need touch to bringing the game one step closer visually and realistically to simulating a real boxing experience. More cinematic cutscenes with the corner preparing the boxer before and during the game. Actually seeing the cutman attempting to reduce the swelling, or trying to prevent blood from pooling in the boxers eye. More knockout animations and
Cutscenes with the ringside announcers reactions during the match. Whether it's pre, during and post scene commentary to capture the aesthetics and feel of the sport.

I played Fight Night Round 3, 4, and Champion extensively and waited a decade for a new boxing game to come around. Usually, I avoid EARLY ACCESS because I'm an oldhead who likes to play a finished product. I made an exception here because boxing is such a niche sport that I want to see grow, and it had been available for one year.

Undisputed gets a lot right in terms of playability, mechanics, and graphics that made Fight Night such a great game for boxing fans. Fights feel overwhelmingly fair, and I've only reported three opponents for what felt like unlimited stamina hacks. 

What's most frustrating right now is the connection quality for me as a NA-West player. I have never seen anything above three out of four bars (yellow). This results in knockdown animations not always triggering, and punches landing when the opponent is well out of reach. Neither are annoying enough for me to stop playing for the foreseeable future. 

I recommend the game if you're a boxing fan, full stop. This is a boxing SIMULATION, so real-world factors like managing stamina, positioning, and timing are all crucial to win fights. 

Remember that you can't expect anyone in a boxing game to fight the way you do. If you spam power punches, expect many players, to let you punch yourself out before knocking you out. If ""running"" or ""body spamming"" are triggering for you, you should look elsewhere. Both are legitimate and often necessary tactics to win a fight, which hasn't stopped anyone from complaining about them since the Fight Night days. glhf",1705435358,1705435358,True,0,0,0.471204221248626709,0,True,False,True

It's like the entire Dev team quit except the character modeling department, and now they're trying to code everything themselves.

While the concept of featuring boxers from 70% UK, 20% USA, and 10% other countries initially intrigued me, I couldn't help but notice the absence of true global representation. In the world of boxing, where talent and champions hail from various corners of the globe, the roster of ""Undisputed"" seems disproportionately skewed towards the UK and the USA.

One glaring omission is the absence of the 8 world division champion, a hallmark of boxing greatness. This exclusion significantly diminishes the authenticity of the game, as these champions represent the pinnacle of the sport. The absence of these iconic figures from different weight classes is a notable oversight that impacts the overall credibility of the game.

Furthermore, the underrepresentation of pound-for-pound champions from powerhouse boxing nations like Japan, the Philippines, and Mexico is disappointing. While I appreciate the inclusion of Canelo Alvarez, limiting the representation to just one boxer from Mexico falls short of capturing the diverse talent and achievements of Mexican fighters in the sport. The omission of legendary boxers from Japan and the Philippines is equally concerning, given their rich contributions to boxing history.

I believe that enhancing the game's roster to include a more extensive and globally diverse selection of boxers, especially champions from different weight classes and regions, would significantly improve the gaming experience. A more comprehensive representation would not only appeal to a broader audience but also reflect the true spirit of international boxing.

I hope you take this feedback into consideration for future updates to ensure ""Undisputed"" becomes a more accurate and inclusive representation of the dynamic world of boxing.

hello everyone i am  updating my review to say this is a entirely broken game all the way from jab and stamina to movement when being hurt or having no stamina and since there is no communicate from the game developers i have no FAITH for this game to be any better than what it is now email the company and they will use the excuse of ""its early access"" but yet  they will MAYBE update the game and be all like its fixed then back to quiet to me this sounds and feels like the full game and with that being said im done with this broken game good luck to everyone who plays this game but even crappy ufc is better than this. 
if they let us know what they are fixing and when then maybe ill keep playing but as for now goodbye.

hello 45 hrs deep in this game and there is nothing but issues for this gaming from punching power to stamina energy to body shots and movement. its hard to ko anyone and if they have 20% stamina they still have movement power and you still can't knock them out. counter shots don't mean much i once had over 20 counter punches on a guy but to never knock him out or down rarely will you ko them. i played every aspect of boxing from brawler to point fighter to out boxing them to the counter fighter and each one almost results the same where im losing in points and even if you do knock down the other boxer he can get up 3 times even when his stamina is at 10% (lowest i got some one ) and still out run you to win the fight movement is not effected by stamina or body punches power punches drain you more than knock the other fighter out  you can apparently knock some one out when your at 24% stamina and 38% health jabs dont do anything not even find distance for the straight behind jab like real life. i know im ranting but damn i want a good boxing game i dont want another bs ufc game that don't get stuff right as well. i send reports all the time and just beyond fed up like how can some fighters throw 5-6 punch combo and some can only do a slow 1-3 punch combo theirs so much more but hey i just want a good boxing game.",1689351100,1705012218,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Undisputed has had a very rough development to put it lightly. Formerly known as ESBC, the game has a lot of gameplay issues ( I'll provide a list at the bottom). You maybe wondering why my playtime is so high yet I'm not recommending it. At 30 bucks, I can't recommend this title. If you're able to catch it on sale, go for it. Plus the devs are very hostile in the discord when players address certain issues, and the recent patches have proven the devs don't really know what they're doing. I haven't played the cpu that much sense it's really ease so I can't give a fair critique. The game does shine when you play a great opponent that's the main reason I kept playing so much. However, if you run into a spammer; it zaps the fun right out of the game. Yes you can negate it but in order to do so. You have to play a boring style which isn't really worth it. I hope this game can pull through

Gameplay issues 
punch tracking
Punching animations 
Blocking animations/Hitboxes
Connection issues... lots of desync
This awkward stickiness when fighting close
Punch damage 
Judging ( lol the irony)
Completely random one punch KOs
Spam

Yes, there's some issues that arise with updates, but considering what you're getting for the price (ea price,) it's an insane value. Controls feel good, although sometimes there's random issues. Again, it's early access and these things can be fixed. The roster is also really nice, with a good variety of old and new. As others have said, it would be nice to see Mike Tyson, George Foreman, Tommy Hearns, Jake Lamotta, etc, but I have absolutely no complaints with what there is now. I expect in the future we'll continue to see a roster expansion with more of our ""wishlist"" picks. Most of these will come via the ""store"" page in-game (and Steam store DLC,) but if they are reasonably priced, I have no real issue with this. As long as the game continues to develop in a positive manner, using DLC as a way to monetize for the long-term makes sense.

Having a good boxing game after so long, especially on PC, is a dream come true for those of us who played the Fight Night series and others (Boxing Legends of The Ring etc.) I highly recommend anyone who enjoyed those games, not to mention boxing fans in general, to give this one a shot.

(2) I understand it is being developed by a smaller studio and thus a smaller budget. (3) I do not have as many hours logged on this game as other reviewers do. With that being said, for those looking to read quickly, I will paraphrase: The game is Disappointing. My experience in this game has mostly been in online fights, so keep that in mind.

PROS: 
-New combat sports game. In a market that is over saturated with shooters and fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter, a new boxing game is refreshing. 

-Graphics look good. 

-In my opinion, the controls are fairly simple to learn and intuitive. 

CONS: 
-Almost every online match quickly turns into a button-mashing slug fest. I find it fun to approach a fight tactically and methodically, focusing on counter-punching and movement. It's almost impossible to play that way as every fight turns into a button-mash fest. 

-The judging in online fights is terrible. The judging focuses heavily on who throws more punches. Many other reviews corroborate this. Judging focuses very little on who throws more accurately, who throws the better power punches, ring control, effective aggression etc. The judging feeds into the button-mashing mess mentioned in the point above. 

-Blocking strikes is wildly inconsistent. At times, a high guard blocks every punch thrown your way like you're Superman or something. Other times, it's like you're not even putting up any defense at all (think Rocky movies where he blocks everything with his face). I've experienced the same thing with different fighters, not matter the rating of the fighter. 

-Similarly, there is nothing stopping a fighter (other than the inconsistent blocking ability) from just holding a high guard all-fight. If you're even a casual fight fan, you will know not a single fighter sits in high guard all fight as it is taxing on the forearms, arms, and shoulders of fighters. And getting punched over and over again in the hands and arms is gonna take its toll over time. A better mechanic should be implemented to prevent this. 

-Body shots do absolutely zero damage. I landed 230+ body shots across 10 rounds in an online fight, yet the other fighter still had almost a full-bar of body health. Make it make sense. 

-Movement is abhorrent. The fighters feel like they're stuck in mud and had cement poured in their shoes. Especially when the high guard is up.  

-Too many cut scenes for online fights. It's ridiculous. I'm not trying to skip through five screens just to begin the fight. And that's if the other player is choosing to skip them too.",1704232693,1704232693,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1. Is this game perfect ? Far from it, It has some issue's with stamina, Some A.I issues & like most early access titles, It has some glitches and bugs that keep it from being a complete product.

2. Is this game fun in its current state ? YES. Incredibly, If you practice and get better the game is very rewarding for the more time you put into practice and learning, Do people spam & use exploits ? Yes. Can technique win over that ? Yes if you keep at it and improve. 

3. The community is full of fairly toxic people at this point, But there are a few of us out there who are honest about the game's current state, But are also honest about the game being very playable and fun in it's current state.

Grab a copy, Put in some time do the training, Practice against the A.I & don't just fall into spamming power shots and exploiting stamina because once it is fixed, It will no longer help you. Learn to actually practice the right techniques & I promise you, You will have some fun in this game in it's current state.

1. NO dedicated servers.  You're playing a P2P connection, and each round you alternate hosting.  When you're not hosting there is a noticeable lag/delay.  You'll often see yourself taking damage when the opponent is out of range (if you're lucky enough to see the hits animating on your screen).  It is called desync, and it makes online play trash.

2. Cheaters.  You'll run into so many of them because they can cheat when they're hosting rounds.  It's pathetic that the game has zero anti cheat.

I've heard for casual offline play like on a couch it's actually super fun.  I don't play offline like that so for me it's basically a useless purchase.

These updates were promised to be ready in Q3 2023, and we are staring at Q1 2024 with no explanation or update explaining the delay.

I will maintain my ""Yes"" recommendation for this game; however, if we do not received the promised content by the end of Q1 2024, I will make this review a thumbs down ""NO"" and will provide more verbiage as to why. This game has a ton of upside and potential....it's time to bring it and make it complete. There is no reason not to at least release a custom character creation.

Original Review: This game is very similar to Fight Night in mechanics, but easily defeats the very good predecessor with phenomenal graphics (Ultra everything). Tyson Fury looks absolutely spot-on at 60FPS on my 4K 85"", and it's a blast to see the movements so similar to the boxers. I really enjoyed Floyd Patterson being on this game, I have a check he wrote someone back in the 70'S with his signature on it. Just a slick old boxer.

Of course with this being EA, there is no career mode, no create a boxer, really not much of anything outside of 1v1 CPU or Online, and a weekly prize fight competition EA puts on. They absolutely need to release the career mode and the create-a-boxer mode. This will defeat the need to license ridiculously expensive or difficult fighters. The commentary needs work badly, as they are vague, contradicting, and don't yet have the ability to say the fighers name. ""You know who"" is said way too often. I assume this is being worked on!

The list of fighters is impressive when you understand the licensing struggles this company must face. Same for music in some of the VR boxing exercise games I play, its a cost analysis to add anything. I really think this is where the create-a-fighter will come in handy.

There are certain things, such as balance, netcode etc that will get sorted with patches, being in early access and such, but the actual boxing itself does not feel good at all. NOTHING feels good. Even winning is just unsatisfying. Some boxers can double up a left hook faster than a 1-2 can be thrown. The punching feels clunky, all of the punches seem to just lack fluidity and don't feel like there's any range to it. This is probably the worst boxing game I've played, and that is not to be cruel or hate on the game. I WANT it to succeed, as I am a huge boxing fan, I just am not very optimistic, and not confident at all in this dev team. The presentation and graphics, 10/10, but that's about all it has going for it.

First the controls are good you can either use the buttons or the Right Stick for punching. Blocking and Bobbing are done with the R and L Triggers respectively.

Because its still in beta there's still a lot of menu selections not avail, but i am excited to see what they come up with.  Visuals, the game looks good still needs a little polishing, cuts, swollen eyes, etc still need work, blood looks painted onto the body but like i said its still in beta.

The AI has always just felt as if it plays by a different set of rules than the player. Their counter windows seem to last 10x as long as, and with the way that the AI behaves no matter what difficulty I seem to put it on, every fight goes the entire distance. 
Knocking fighters out is rare (unless it's you). 
The damage output seems reliant on countering, but my ability to counter punch effectively seems like a complete crap shoot either with punches landing in what I thought was the counter window awarding no counter - And other punches that I would think would be a perfect counter punch end up in my fighters arm awkwardly stopping mid swing. 

There are a lot of mechanics at play here but I just wish they were more present, and I had a way to understand them a lot more. Everything feels so nebulous and against the players favor. There is a consistent sense of questioning the input and output of your fighter.  And even though I'll play a good match and come out on top consistently, each fight doesn't feel like a logical progression of game systems (like wearing down stamina, or doing targeted damage over the course of a fight). 

Instead it feels like you're trying to achieve a constantly shifting set of goals that the game wants you to hit, like pull off a 5 punch combo, in which you also dodged and counter punched netting bonus damage - like it's some sort of fighting game input combo to trigger the knockout condition. Which would be fine, but the problem is your stamina rapidly draining despite pulling off perfect punches means you're never able to have the output required without adjusting the game settings. 

It's just too strange. Like I said at the beginning, I want to like it a lot more. I want to love it but the game feels like it has a set of shadow mechanics at play behind each fight that are actively bringing the game experience down. I don't recommend in EA just yet.

1 it has potential 
2 every update seems to make gameplay worse
3 game crases when loading matches
4 freezed games after a win
5 time stops and you can go on forever until someone surrenders
6 punches counted from over half a ring
7 after round 3-4 , suddenly any punch is good to ""rock"" no matter how dominant you are 
8 impossible to get a referee stop on cuts 
9 damage to head or body is a joke, i can punch 12 round on a head and it wont do nothing, opponent get a lucky shot and there i go
10 HACKERS , uppercut spammers, hook spammers --> still after more then a year ....
11 surrenders when on the floor should be counted as a ko. 
12 power punches are too sloooooow
13 overpowered favorites from the developers
14 ducking weaving and slipping should be way more fluent
15 inputs are not registered or happening too late
16 glitches , overall glitches besides self shutting don and freezes, how hard can it be to NOT have a GIANT head in the WHOLE SCREEN from someone aside of the ring....

The problem is that updates have been slowing down immensely and have been deteriorating in quality. The update that dropped 12/7 that we've been waiting 3  months for broke more than it fixed. So much so that the game is in an unplayable state right now. 

This latest update gave us some wonderful bugs. Input delay on movement and punches at weird times. Diagonal dodge doesnt always work now like it did just a few hours ago. Total toss of the dice on whether you actually move or not. Knock downs not counting on the score card. I saw someone get knocked down 4 times but only have 1 of those register on the cards. 

The game cannot keep taking backward steps like this. I cant imagine that anyone tested this before releasing. The game is getting decidedly worse with each patch. It's clear this dev team isnt up to the task.",1700782343,1702826480,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Server selection is like picking a mystery box. Want to punch someone from your own region? Too bad! The game picks for you.

The lag makes fighters teleport like ninjas. You think you're hitting them, but surprise! Your punch lands a meter away.

One-punch wonderland: meet players who think they're the Hulk. They spam one power punch like there's no tomorrow. Seriously, do these guys ever get tired?

Damage areas are as limited as a budget buffet. Right now, it's all about the eye corners. How about some variety?

This game has to be the biggest let down that we've had in the gaming industry in a long time. The gameplay itself is very boring and repetitive. The judging in this game is worse than the judging of Paddy the baddy's last fight by far, and the matchmaking is awful. Constantly placing me with people who have high ping issues. The discord and the community for this game are also terrible. Talked about how I lost a round after having two rocks whilst my opponent hadn't rocked me a single time and basically just got trolled and shit talked by the community and discord moderator just for giving feedback of the judgiging. Don't buy this game anytime soon, Check again in 6 months to a year to see if anyone thinks it's improved at all. if It wasn't too late I would refund it and not look back. Hopefully the number of people the devs have baited people into buying this game will prove to EA that we want boxing games, and they will continue the fight night games into the current generation. Played another match on Feb 12th after multiple updates. Game is still trash. Judging hasn't been fixed or modified at all. Matchmaking and network connection still awful.

Add shitty content and constantly fuck up everything they try and fix. The devs treat balancing this game like a pendulum. They listen to the fan base 3 months too late about an issue then attempt to fix iit and make it leagues worse but for the opposite reason. Donn say the ai is too easy because they'll just give them the ability to dismantle you in one lucky punch but they'll still lack any skill. Tell them a character is too powerful in any skill and instead of a nerf they'll release a character twice as busted. Lastly... quit setting release dates dip shits. I have my doubts you ever learned to read a calendar. Maybe someday in the distant future this game will be playable but until you sell off all rights to it there's  no chance it ever gets any better.

The online MM is super inconsistent too, you sit in a loading screen for 5+ minutes just to disconnect in the first round. This happens with at least 4/10 fights I match make for. This game has so much potential but feels like the game is run by careless devs and ABSOLUTELY no one who works for SCI actually wants to see this game do well. They said in November we would have a career mode in the game by fall. SCI is based in the UK, fall has come and gone and all we got was ""a revamped woman's division"" but all they did was add one playable female fighter. Just feels like SCI are lazy and are happy to watch this game to go down the drain.Feels like undisputed is going to be another one of those titles that could have gone onto greatness but fell short. Fell super duper short.

 I think they also need to add more speed to the punches. Feels like you're punching underwater sometimes, lol. But awesome graphics, animations and physics. Top notch fighter models. 

Every time I play this game, I have to update my review lol. The more I play it the more addictive it becomes. Ali is my favorite, his movements are spot on! I've played with most of the fighters and they are all great with excellent detail and realism in look and movement.  Footwork is amazing and detailed with little nuance movements to add per-fighter uniqueness. Every fighter ""feels"" different...and in a good way.

Even for early access this is pretty bad.

Not sure what happened but now my strix 3070ti is struggling to even run this at 1440. Was running this at 4k with little problems a few months back but having not played for a while to allow the game to get some much needed attention, it appears to be in a infinitely worse state than it was just a few months back. Screen is stuttering all over the place and fighters are moving around as if someone hit a slow-mo button somewhere(i was genuinely looking on my controller to see if id hit a button by mistake).

The game is practically unplayable for me at the moment, and with it almost being a year into early access its puzzling how the game is in a worse state now than it was a month after release. 

Makes you wonder what NASA supercomputer they were using to record the footage of the seamless slick moving boxing fights we saw in their promotionals over 3 years ago, when this is what I have in front of me today. Judging by the last 12 months we are still 3 years off at LEAST from what they presented ! 

Really want this to be a success, not hating for the sake of hating, and have been patiently praying for a brilliant new boxing game after FNC, but this ain' it coach !

TLDR: Graphics are stunning. Current Gameplay is stiff, slow and heavy, physics is bad which make the game boring and just not fun. No career mode as of this time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRAPHICS: This game has top-notch graphics. Stunning and realistic. No complaints as to that area.

GAMEPLAY: The current gameplay feels stiff and is kinda frustrating since this is the most important aspect of a boxing game. But as of now, its just not fun to play. The movement of the fighters are excellent, but the bobbing and weaving feel kinda weak and are non-factor if you are avoiding punches, or on the defensive. You cant move while bobbing or weaving. 

Punches feel telegraphed, stiff, slow and heaving, but doesn't have much impact, and its difficult or just not fun to pull combinations. 

I feel like they could tweak the head physics a little bit when hitting your opponent or when your'e getting hit by them. Its unrealistic to throw power punches and see the fighter merely affected.

Its very difficult to bruise or cut your opponent or character even after battering or getting battered for several rounds. Visual damages are almost non-existent as to my experience which add to the game being less interesting.

Stamina management is bad and feels intrusive to the core gameplay. 

AUDIO: No complaints.

ROSTER: Good selection of fighters so far. Considering that its still in early access.

ONLINE: No comment. Since I'm not having fun with Quick Fights, I rarely play online.

Hard to recommend the game at this point, but I would love for it to succeed.

2-3 venues you'd want to play in. Most are tiny gyms or clubs. 

Terrible stamina system. You can wail your opponents with liver shots, missing hardly any punches. You're gasping for air within 5 rounds where the opponent is fresh and their body is damage-free.

Introduction:
Undisputed has a ridiculous amount of potential to be the biggest boxing game. Sadly as someone who purchased undisputed immediately I can say almost every update has sent it in a downhill direction. 

Online mode:
Online mode in undisputed simply does not function due to issues on both the players and games end. Many players who stuck around this long through the poor updates abuse the few punches such as body uppercuts that allow for easy wins, it isn't fun. As for the games side? Essentially online runs off of host rounds, each player takes a turn hosting the match in alternating rounds. Although good in theory this means the host has a great advantage and in almost all cases the non hosting player wont even see the actual punches that are occuring, it is misleading. (There are more issues online but these are some main ones.

Offline mode:
Offline mode in undisputed had remained half decent for a while of Undisputeds history other than minor issues. As of the new update it has become completely destroyed. Some punches will not throw at all, as well as punches being thrown off the release of a button instead of when you click it. The opponent ai itself seems to be a lot more skittish in this update. Throwing minimal punches and running for the majority of each round. 

Recap of all issues:
-Desync/host rounds
-Bad connection to game
-'Janky' AI
-Delayed punches
-Long match search times
-Game freezing after opponent leaves
-Buttons simply not working sometimes
-Easily abuseable controls
-Most fighters are 'unviable

And many more issues.

Conclusion:
The game as of right now is in a HORRIBLE state. I believe it has the potential to be great still but until then I cannot recommend Undisputed to anyone.",1676620799,1702087828,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,True

As someone who has played the game since it was first released I can confidently say it is starting to show signs of improvement as is expected with a small studio releasing a game in early access. The potential of the game is massive and because of that, I believe the devs may have bitten off a bit more than they can chew and are now working to make up for that. This does not excuse the lack of communication from the devs notably between September 2023 up until the recent postponement of career mode.

It is important to know that this is a technical boxing game. If you think you can utilize Rocky Marciano like Ali you may struggle or get frustrated. Knowing how your fighter operates along with their strengths and weaknesses makes this game a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to future updates and encourage the development team to get better with communication on all platforms.

total scam 1/10
i would like to be proven wrong at some point but as it stands I've had almost no fun. Edit 12/7/23 still same review however I'am more sad than ever because this game was clearly a passion project where the team clearly cares about this game. At the time of announcement i was excited to see a new boxing game in almost a decade but i have spent maybe 10% of my time actually having fun. This game is so boring and fights are so unexciting. Online fights are faster and much more fun but 1/3 are either are using exploits, hacks, or horrible lag and that's all after waiting for 5 min for a match. I was hoping the updates would improve the game however its even more boring. They claim to have an adaptive AI that will change as you play...but it doesnt work at all most ai with block everything while standing there but if you get super super close they throw about 2 attacks(ive played most characters both genders). I am overall super upset and probably wont ever get a game before its full release just like preordering because at this point it is all a scam. I can not ever recommend people buy this game because i believe games should be fun, hard, or both depending on how you like gaming, however this games lacks all. still 1/10",1676867455,1702009306,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The motion capture used allows for an authentic and natural feel to each individual boxer which is also a neat touch (Ali moves just like he did in real life I swear I almost think I'm watching an actual film of him whilst playing as him at times)


It's still in early access and is still a work in progress, many things still need to be addressed i.e

- Cheaters and spammers are still very prevalent online

- Boxers stats and ratings are unrealistic at the moment for a few fighters in particular

- AI needs a bit more improvement, it's getting there though

- Patches and updates are few and far between

I remember playing endless rounds and training sessions on XBOX 360 with ""Fight Night"" back in 2004. 

At the time, the game was so fun and addictive, its all I wanted to play on XBOX even though I had 100 other games on it. And I will be honest I was a still a teenage boy past his puberty at the time.(sometimes I feel like I still am)

With all that to say, there are few pros and cons about this game and I hope they fix some of these cons. (I like to eat my veggies first)

CONS.

- WBC Arena map has a huge design flaw where the ""Cameraman NPC"" is blocking a partial view of the fight when you are rotating around the ring not only tempers with your game play and I understand they wanted to put in the realism aspect but at least blur the guy so it doesn't block the view.

- Foot works and defense mechanisms are specific to individual fighter style but the basic core skills such as 'Jabs' / 'Hooks' / 'Uppercuts' / etc.. 
Are pretty much same ""Action"" regardless of the character selected which was a bit dissapointing to find out.

- I wish you can fight Versus different classes. I know it will be a joke to play a match with Katie Taylor from ""LIGHTWEIGHT"" with Muhammad Ali from ""HEAVYWEIGHT"" BUT it would be both fun and challenging to play from either side.

- LOADIIIIIIINNNNNG time is pretty ridiculous for a game made in 2023. After selecting your champ and selecting the arena you wish to play. The loading time it takes for the actual game play may take upto 5 mins (which is comparable at 1 min at max with other games)

------------------------------------

PROS

- Amazing graphic and the impact on hit almost feels surreal as if you are in the boxing match. And I would LOVE to see this game progress to be a better game. 

- I like how you can temper with Stamina and Damage of the fighter to make the game a bit more fast paced but I wish you can only have this effect on the ""Player"" but not for the ""PC"".



The game itself is a bit challenging to learn with the controller but after 12 hours of playing, I was able to beat intermediate mode in normal mode and although Pro is a bit more challenging, it is beatable after 20 hours. 

In conclusion, I have high expectations for future outlook of this game and I hopr the 'Coming soon' options are available soon at ^""NO EXTRA COST""^

And yes I would recommend this game.

If I'm really THAT gassed... as a professional fighter would I throw a punch that takes 5 seconds to get to my target?  no, I wouldnt do that as an amateur.  Every update things just get worse.  Right now it's near unplayable.  Like to snipe power punches?  Too bad, power means absolutely nothing.  When you take a super straight right to the chin, just chill it's fine.  Don't like to lose?  COOL!  RUN!  However, if you love to cheese mechanics, pick this up right now.  If learning a single combo and spamming it 300 times a match is your thing, OMG i found your game.

You're gonna play exhibitions til this game evaporates.  Career mode is hardly in the scopes
EDIT:  HAS NOT GOTTEN BETTER
These developers have no idea what they're doing.  They continue to add new boxers when the ones they have are BROKEN.  Running, turtling, body uppercut spam, straight punch spam, it's EVERY MATCH.  The times you get a match with a decent opponent it gets DISCONNECTED.  The reddit is toxic full of ""Develop a game yourself then"" type idiots SHUT UP.  THEY are supposed to be the pros and they keep shoveling GARBAGE out to us.  OMG bro do you know how infuriating it is to be up in a match then get flash knockout by a straight punch that didn't even hit you?  Bro i been knocked out several times by a guy walking into me.  This thing is GARBAGE id rather play an EA BOXING GAME and holy God that's desperate.  THIS JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.  i have never tried to steer people away from a game so hard I keep playing cause i wanna love it but fr, don't even think about it.  They dont deserve our money, they deserve to be out of business forever.  Go work retail, go stock shelves, go load pallets, this aint for you.  Yall are TERRIBLE.  The new youtuber they hired might as well whoop everyone and QUIT hes too good for this.
Edit again:  10/31/2023
Imagine you make a drink or something.  Your customers tell you ""this drink sucks"".
So instead of changing your recipe, business, practices or whatever, you tweak the recipe.  Not only that, but you bring in shills who will tell you whatever you do to that recipe is great and OMG it's all I wanted.  That's this game.  I'm writing this edit while waiting for a game.  I'm 100% right when I say, the matchmaking favors certain boxers.  If you pick x boxer, it's likely youll get y boxer.  If you pick a bad boxer, youll get a match in no time at all and lose cause he hit your shoulder with a stray left hook.  II implore everyone, DO NOT BUY THIS.  They're introducing career mode soon which I thought might be a good idea, but wait til you see the broken boxers these people will come up with,  Theyll be invincible, and Steel City's answer will be to finally add Mike Tyson so he can beat your career character up.  Then the games title will be Mike Tyson's journey ending the career of your self-made boxer til we eventually quit on this idea all together

Based on the developers' assurances and my own enthusiasm for boxing games, I decided to take a chance on the game. Unfortunately, my experience with Undisputed has been far from satisfactory, and I have ultimately decided to request a refund.

The most significant reason for my dissatisfaction is the delay of the career mode update. The promise of a career mode was a major selling point for me, as I enjoy the depth and progression that career modes offer. However, the developers have pushed the update back to next year, leaving me with a game that feels incomplete and lacking in substance.

Apart from the missing career mode, I have also encountered several issues with the game's multiplayer mode. The multiplayer experience is marred by a rampant hacking problem, with cheaters disrupting matches and ruining the competitive spirit of the game. It has become increasingly difficult to find fair and enjoyable matches online, further diminishing the game's appeal.

In addition to these major issues, I have also found the game's overall gameplay to be unpolished and lacking in depth. The combat mechanics feel repetitive, and the lack of variety in game modes makes the experience feel stale.

Overall, my experience with Undisputed has been disappointing. The delayed career mode update, the rampant cheating in multiplayer, and the overall lack of polish have made the game unplayable for me. I have requested a refund and would not recommend this game to others until significant improvements are made.",1701155386,1701529667,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Why waste yours and everyone else's time stating the obvious?  Certain sections of the gaming community just love to moan and tear something down without offering anything constructive!

I think it's apparent that people are forgetting that SCI are only a small development studio that doesn't have a AAA budget.  What they've managed to pull off here so far is by no means an easy feat and very impressive.

Playing this game now versus the first open beta, I believe it has MASSIVELY improved.

The visuals are gorgeous so far, a solid base to work from and the animations are very nice in places too.

From what I can see, the only thing that really needs touching up now is the overall presentation of the game to bring it more in line with the real thing.  It looks like an open beta at the moment, it's now about putting those finishing touches on that will take this from a very good boxing game, to a great boxing game: -

Ring Entrances - Boxers need their robes, need the strobe effects, smoke etc.

Referee - Game needs a choice of referees and the character model needs to actually be in the ring breaking up clinches, warning the fighters etc - such an obvious omission being rectified here will make a dramatic difference to the look and feel of the fights.

Corner men/work - This is where you can really take the game to the next level - have the manager call for the wet towel on the fighters back in the later rounds, have the water bottle ready to take a swig and spit into the bucket, have the cold compress and have the Vaseline and the cut team ready to make adjustments to the fighters faces between rounds.  I have memories of an earlier Fight Night game (can't remember which one it was now), where the corner work was like a mini game and you had to prioritise how you freshened and fixed up your fighter's damage putting you in strategic control of how you send you send them back out i.e. are you more concerned about the right eye closing up and reducing the swelling, or are you going to divert your time and attention to reducing the nasty gash on the other eye?

This here is what is going to make or break this as a sports sim and it will add that additional layer of strategy that can totally flip the outcome of a fight.

The career mode would be a nice bonus, but not essential in my view, as long as the game nails everything we love about the sport and puts the player in moire control over fights than they ever have done, this game will take some beating (no pun intended).

I do think we need to see Chris Eubank Senior and Julian Jackson added to this game at some point, it feels a little naked without them.

It would also be a really good touch if you could get Michael Watson and Gerald McClellan in the game too, they were definitely formidable fighters who probably should see some representation here, despite their careers being tragically cut short.

Conclusion: - Definitely worth investing in the current game and the developer, I just hope the budget is strong enough to see it reach the vision I hope they share with the boxing fans.",1701123530,1701126949,True,1,0,0.50440526008605957,0,True,False,True

Case in point: they announced that Career Mode and Custom Fighters, two very highly anticipated features, were coming ""Fall 2023"". They announced this halfway through September. With promises for ""more info in the coming months.""
Now it's November 27. Not only has the game not been updated once, not only has there not been a single piece of info, but they deleted that announcement. Instead of saying ""Hey, sorry, we misjudged our ability to finish this task in the timeframe we set for ourselves"", they pretended like that never happened.
That alone is incredibly unprofessional and reason enough to never give this studio a cent. Unfortunately, in the 10 months since the game left Beta (Yes a beta before Early Access), the devs have followed pretty much the exact same path - the updates have been less and less frequent and incredibly meaningless. At best, they replace old problems with new ones. Sometimes they've simply added new ones. Nothing of substance has been added, balance is probably worse than it was at launch, and there's almost nothing to do in the game.

Although it's far from perfect, it's easy to see how much passion has been put into to making Undisputed a truly deep and satisfying boxing experience. 

It has extremely high quality renders of real, iconic boxing legends and up-and-comers as well. Muhammad Ali's rendering and animations are frighteningly accurate, for example. There are legitimately jaw-dropping moments in the fighter animations that make you feel as though you're truly stepping into their shoes. One thing I'm looking forward to is even more player differentiation to make each fighter feel unique and each fight have a distinct style and flow.

The gameplay is developing to be a great middleground between pure simulation and a fun, fast-paced arcade style. The extemely wide variety of punches incorporated in the directional punching system creates the chance for a high level of strategy in order to adapt to your opponent's fighting style.

Things I'd like to see improved:
- more variety in ring entrance animations
- more variety corner animations based on fighters' health, stamina and damage
- bigger stamina hit when knocked down
- more visible damage effects
- simpler lobby creation with friends",1701107860,1701107860,True,1,0,0.50440526008605957,0,True,False,True

This game is a tribute to the legend Mohammed Ali .

Where ever he is, he's smiling above ...mortals like us can finally box and sore opponents.

FEW QUOTES FROM THE LEGEND:

1. i am the greatest, i said this even before i knew i was 
2. Champions aren't made in the gym, champions are made from something, they have deep inside them - a desire, a dream, a vision

3.  Don't quit suffer now and live the rest of your life as champion 
4. Don't count the days,  make the days count

5. if you dream of beating me, you better wake up and apologize 
6. Silence is golden when you can't think of an answer

7.  I don't have to be what you want me to be
8.  if there is no enemy within,  enemy outside can do you no harm

 WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME

 UFC is not coming to PC and now they can see my middle finger

 This is the best boxing game ever, after fight night to be made for humankind

 If you have ever seen this sport or have even a slight interest in this sport, don't think, don't wait just buy it.

 Dev looks passionate and won't abandon us in middle, we will have great content even after early access

Conclusion: buy this to go bonkers, show your wrath to your opponents, break faces and hopes...

Medical benefits of playing this game are aplenty too.  You may imagine your boss as opponent and smash him out , you can for sure reduce your stress.

MY QUOTES:

you can shatter faces, bodies , hopes but never shatter hearts and humanity !!- Aghori

Before you face your opponents outside, face yourself inside - Aghori

Just go ahead potential buyers and boxers but beware you will face me sometime and you may regret your decision..

Regards
Your's wrathful Boxer

- I have multiple slow-mo videos of my opponents missing big time then magically I'm on the ground
- almost every online match you play you will see the bad connection symbol on the top of your screen

Honest review based on its current state: (please no hate!) 
-Graphics is great! Boxer details are right on the dot!
-The game is way better than the initial release, thanks to the addition of few fighters and venue
-Can not change the camera angle or how fast it spins (for the nauseated peeps out there!)
-There should be an option to lower the gameplay speed (for real simulation), it seems like everything is fast-paced! 
-There should be an option to change the controller icon from XBox to PS symbols

The not so very good about this game!
-hackers and cheaters are blatantly everywhere!
-no anti-cheat
-de-sync issues when playing online!

The game, above all, is still RECOMMENDABLE! the pros outweighs the cons. I did not mention how GREAT and BEAUTIFUL the graphics in this game! from Rings, Gyms and actual Boxers the details from smallest to the most obvious ones were on point and lit! 

still waiting for the other features to be release but i got a high hopes that this game will be on fire once it reach its full release!

So I'm coming back to this review after 6 or so  months and I must say I'm disappointed.

I was very surprised that the game is way less fluid, less organic and less natural than before. I struggle with my own boxer 10 times more than against the opponent. It feels very clunky and the footwork is way less smooth. Directional punches seem to be excessively nerfed. It kinda felt like a turn based game to be honest.

The base of the game is solid, but there are many aspects that need improvement. In particular, the online mode needs a lot of work. If multiplayer is a decisive factor for you, it might be better to wait before buying this game.

Despite these problems, the game has great potential. I believe that the developers are aware of the areas that need improvement, such as artificial intelligence, some animations, and the overall balance of the game, and they are working to solve these problems.

The actual combat is wildly unrealistic, and I believe this is due to bad basic game design philosophy. It wants to be a hyper realistic boxing sim, but it also wants to be a game that's fun to play. It tries to do both and does neither. If Muhammad Ali were to hit an amateur fighter as hard as he could, and it connects perfectly, there's no chance the amateur continues the fight. He was also insanely fast. You can't play at his level of speed. You can't hit as hard as you want. You hit at a game specific level to keep the fight going, and at a similar speed for game balance. You also gas yourself in relatively the same number of punches, regardless if you're playing Ali or Eddie Hall. The injury system seems neat at first, but it's almost impossible to cut your opponent, and damage heals insanely fast between rounds. To test this I've played the best vs worst fighters on every difficulty setting, with every option giving me more ability to dish out damage and last longer in the fight. The result?

Overall I highly recommend the game early, there's so much to learn and time. different fighters, different stances, different punch output style. Don't over punch those first 4 rounds. 

Once Career Mode opens and create a fighter I see limitless possibilities. Hopefully the makers will allow for mods from our community.

Whilst to be honest there are definitely still issues with the game with hackers still somehow being present despite a very small player base. 

There is additionally many bugs within the game as well to list the ones that I found whilst playing -
>Larry Holmes & Canelo Alvarez are moving/doing things quicker than intended making an issue between selecting opponents to counter them. It's still absolutely possible to beat them but its more an issue at top level ranked fights.
>Physic issues with the arms, when punching you will at times see the arms of fighters be manipulated in a manner that makes no sense.
>Flash knockdown's do not award a 10-8 round
>Lag issues but that can be put down to low player count

I would recommend this game solely on the fact that there is no other boxing game that does what it does. Additionally there is no other combat game that allows for fair and progressive play that allows players to improve without having to be mechanical memorising patterns. This is me looking at UFC 5's horrible gameplay, this is definitely the best fight game that has/hasn't release this year. Another benefit to this game is we know that the developers are still working on it to try and make it better.

Graphically its a good looking game as well, obviously its not quite on the same presentation value as a UFC 5 but its visuals do the job. It's a massive upgrade visually from the last big boxing game i.e. Fight Night Champion.

Finally, some things the game could do to improve quality of life -
>More fighters do need to be added, there is low amount of top tier fighters per division and that's something that needs to be looked at. Klitschko brothers, Lennox Lewis, Mike Tyson, Holyfield and the list could go on and that's just heavyweight. More variety in every division is needed.
>Stamina is something that might need to be toned down further, this could make gameplay more tactical
>Damage values i.e. taking damage bar down a little more quicker is something I think definitely needs to be applied. Far too many fights go the full 12 rounds.
>Additionally to above the same rule can be applied to facial damage.
>Finally, I think it would be smart to implement a condition that reduces the block of an opponent quicker the more fatigued he is.

I still think online has a way to go, the changing host every round is a nice compromise however and actually caused me to rethink my approach to online fights. I can't wait to see future updates and continue to improve my skill. I have a few complaints and areas for improvement, I would like to see a harder difficulty for offline play and the already mentioned online lag issues. I would also like if the daily challenge fights had some more variety and challenges to them: maybe something like the story mission in fight night where your right hand is broken for a fight or you have to win a fight in a specific round.

To Summarize, if you enjoyed the fight night games or enjoy sports games this is a good game to play. Maybe wait a little while for some of the bugs to be worked out and a little bit more polish put in but I absolutely love this game.


(this is a followup, I have stopped playing this game regularly. Honestly I lost a lot of my hope for this game. It feels too arcade like. It never feels like a real fight. FNC actually sea,s to have a ""more realistic"" feel to it. every character seems like they can take way too many punches. changing the difficulty seem to help a bit, but making punches do more damage doesn't make the game more realistic. I want to feel like a fighter, I want a mistake to have some impact. instead I cake body punches like i have a granite and my chin wont crack. for now I cant recommend this game.

When your using top level pros you shouldn't be running out of stamina so fast!!!! I can see it maybe in the later rounds but in the first round you throw more then 3-4 punches and stamina is gone. Very fake. Also the movements/punches need to be sped up. As a boxer for 7 years this just feels very arcadish, but I see huge potential. Stamina way out of adjustment. Get rid of the cameraman on the side of the ring, if you ever watched a pro fight, do you see a cameraman on the side of the ring getting in the way of the actual camera? Makes no sense. Definitely  need to make it so that you can change controller settings as well, the buttons for guard up, slipping, and power seems a little off. Not sure how to be honest. If if they are made editable would be great, as everyone will probably have a different opinion on this. Career mode will make this game much better as well, as that is coming soon.... I think.  But lot of work on how movement and stamina feels is needed. Speed up the movement. And stamina should decline more by punch count/rounds as the fight progresses, not by a simple combo, and combos are what really feel off and I think its the stamina that holds the smoothness back. The top pros should be able to throw 60-80 punches a round with out acting like they never ran a mile in their life, at least till later rounds... Look at some ""real fight stats"" to get a better idea devs. Also if you do take this advice for stamina, feather, lightweight, small fighters always have more stamina and throw more punches, also more speed. As fighters get heavier they lose speed gain power. A person should definitely notice the affects from weight class to weight class. For this being 2023 vs old boxing games like Fight night, this baby needs some work, so hopefully it can grow to something great.

Other than that, if they don't continue to add fighters (Emanuel Augustus and his style would be the greatest) and tuning the system, this isn't worth getting. If they do get it if you love fight night.

6/15/20 edit

I jumped on for a bit. The new fighters are fun. They feel different slightly and the games mechanics seem to be updated. Punches start wearing down fighters now so that's great. Besides the occasional glitch, this game is better than it was before. Hopefully they  find ways to add in more fighters though. Its a recommend especially when its a completed full game hopefully.

Update: 11-6-23

The game is close to perfect. I suppose big heavyweight fighters can move around with ease is a little goofy, but the game overall is really fun.",1678045343,1699336929,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Positives:
-Amazing fighting game,really like the movement and would love to see the new combos and new realistic moves they are planning to add in the future.
-Really good graphics.
-Controls are easy enough to understand but hard to master so it adds some challenge.
-Good roaster of real boxers,would love to wait and see until they get the licenses for all the greats(Mike Tyson,Prince Naseem,Gervonta Davis etc) however not all weigh classes are present so naturally limited roaster of boxers for now.

Negatives:
-Take too long to load,even in the main menus.
-Sometimes the connection is not great in online ranked mode.
-Some fighters are too unbalanced(Like Canelo where people spam his hooks and get easy win) so the developers do need to work on their balancing and match the fighter's in game ability with it in real life.
-Would like to see more in the build up in the game,especially when career mode drops.
-Bugs like stamina not going below 39% etc these minor issues should be fixed.

After a very basic tutorial, you have to face the elite boxers. So you don’t even know the very basic combination like 1-1-2, 1-2-3…in the mean time your opponent already delivered fancy combination with steps, they surround you, in and out, throw punches up and down…and they’re super fast.

I think at least this game should relies training mode at the beginning. Players need to learn and get the feeling of distance and timing,  the combinations, the steps…and they can train one skill in a time by fight with lower opponents.

Don’t think only people who actually play boxing have interest to this game, the way you did is shut off the door to the potential players.

There are exploits that work since day 1. The most memorable one is turning off your internet as you lose and when you reconnect, you get awarded a win. Most people at the top have crazy streaks for this exact reason. It's hard to tell who is a legit player or not.

There is no career mode, so you can 1) play 3 new legendary fights weekly 2) play with bots(it gets tedious) 3) risk the cesspool of online play

Edit: This game has gotten worse since the previous review. The servers lag to the point that you only experience desync or disconnections. You can fight a round thinking you dodged every strike, only to see your health bar worn down, between rounds. Worse, you might actually be playing a cheater and after winning every second of every round, you're dropped several times by 1 single punch. 

Straights are sometimes incredibly powerful and sometimes totally weak. The sway system is easily exploitable and the AI with spam it on the high difficulties. 

Like any fighting game, high ranked fighters are the meta, but the game makes the difference between the top 3 and the rest of the field in any division, significant enough to make most of the roster useless online. You could train with them and know every strength and weakness of the lower ranked fighter but you'll be fighting the top ranked fighters over and over. The roster needs a rebalance AND online needs to create a better insensitive for using lower ranked fighters.

You may find yourself in a fight with a good ping, against a mid ranked fighter, but they will probably quit when you start to pull ahead. Actually, they might quit before you even start the fight.

I still jump in for a fight here and there but they need to make significant fixes to the gameplay before its worth full price. A career mode will not fix the issues and I expect to see complaints about the AI take over the board when the career does launch, along with the current connection complaints.",1681441707,1698826142,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't get me wrong, the game isn't perfect but its not nearly as bad as alot of people are stating.
Online is a bit hit or miss. I can only seem to find a fight in the Heavyweight division and most people play as Wilder or Fury simply because they seem a bit OP and all people care about it the win.

Single player is decent and there is a good range of fighters to choose from.  Im still trying to find the right balance of settings to get the most realism for me.

This is a game that you kinda get out of it what you put in. If you sit and spam bodyshots over and over and over then yeah you will win (until its more balanced), but if you approach it more open minded and try to use different tactics you will find an enjoyable boxing game that can fill the void left by FNC.

Playing in 2560x1440 with all ultra graphics, seeing Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder standing in the same ring, really blew my mind. It looked just like the boxing game I've been dreaming about for years. Truly amazing, when you consider that it was made by a very small studio with a very small budget (in comparison to EA anyway).

However, I'm afraid to say that's where my praise ends.

The gameplay feels very slow and sluggish when playing as a heavyweight. And while yes, I'm not expecting lightning fast punches, the heavyweights can punch surprisingly fast in reality. Tyson Fury shouldn't look gassed out after 6 rounds, only being able to throw 2-3 punches before needing a breather. While the other weight classes don't feel slow or sluggish per say, they do still feel very stiff. The game is very much just stand and bang on the spot, no matter how much I try move round the ring, it always ends up being a 12 round slugfest. You can hit power shot, after power shot, after power shot and STILL the opponent shrugs it off. I'm talking flush right hands on the chin in round 12, and the opponent barely flinches. It's extremely tiring doing just one match, as you throw about 800+ scoring punches without getting one knockdown.

Also, the AI opponents are hard to balance. Amateur is too easy, they don't even punch they just stand there like a human punch bag (but still takes about 100 flush shots to put them down, then they are guaranteed to get up twice in most cases). Then anything from intermediate and up the AI just spam body shots all fight long. The second you make an effort to defend your body, you get hit in the head instantly (reminiscent of UFC 3). It's virtually impossible to go the whole fight without having a badly injured head or body. Even really low rated fighters turn into boxing legends on anything past amateur, who need 300 right hands to go down.

Also, there isn't any of those flash knockouts like Fight Night. The super satisfying one punch knockouts that end the fight, or randomly daze or knock down your opponent. On this game, you just have to keep spamming punches until their health on that particular part of the body goes down to nothing, then they enter a stunned state, then you finish them off and knock them down. It always follows the same pattern, very boring. That's something I'd expect from a PS2 game.

Don't even get me started with online. Every single fight you just go against Muhammad Ali, where the player just spams left and right hooks, that are so fast and so constant that you can't do anything, literally nothing. Occasionally you get someone just trying to have a nice technical boxing match, which can be fun, but it does get tiring after you land 500 flush shots, it's round 12 and they are still standing.

The commentary is god awful, but there's no option to only turn off commentary. They repeat the same five lines over and over. Even if I am absolutely decimating my opponent, the commentators will still keep going on about how close the fight is. It's tiring to listen to.

Also, due to the extremely limited roster so far, it's a shame create a fighter isn't available. They really should have had this ready for early access, so we could at least create some fighters to fill up the roster a bit.

I would currently rate this game a 5/10. I deducted 1 point for the slow/sluggish/stiff gameplay, 1 point deducted for every fight being a 12 round slugfest, 1 point for no flash knockdowns/knockouts as I feel this is what makes a boxing game exciting, 1 point for the tiring button spamming online which just feels like the UFC stand and bang mode, and 1 point for the terrible commentary.

EDIT:

Today is 26/06, quite some time after my initial review above. I just wanted to say that literally nothing has changed. Well, they changed the head health to the whole head, and body health to the whole body, but the game is still a sparring simulator. Still no flash knockouts, maybe like 1 in 100 fights. Still boring as hell.

EDIT:

I've sat down and waited for this games release for years since fight night never did another game (useless twats).
Anyway this game has potential.
The movement is good.
Sometimes fluid.
Most of the time not.
The punches don't feel as effective as they should even if you have 100% stamina vs someone with 25% health.
Not sure if power exists or not moreso than luck.
Anyway a lot of cheaters to the point its available to everyone to download on wemod.
The devs know.
Do nothing about it.
But they are finally releasing career mode but i don't hold my breath at all because I have fight night champion on a PS3 for legacy mode.
I doubt they can compete but who knows.

As of now I don't think this game will get any better by the time a fight night game is announced or released.
I think this game is mostly on borrowed time and a dedicated fanbase who refuse to see reason because its early access.

Don't buy it yet unless your a big boxing fan.
If you box or have done boxing before maybe give the game a pass.

I think it has great potential as more fighters are added to the mix. I'd be willing to pay for boxer DLC and it would be a good opportunity for older retired boxers to make money based off of their likeness.  I only have a couple of serious criticisms.  One of my biggest peeves is that when fighting ranked online fights, there are no scoring considerations for a lower-skilled boxer beating a higher-skilled boxer.  For example, I should receive more points if I use Ricky Hatton to beat Sugar Ray Robinson.  Or Carl Froch beating Canelo.  Or Larry Holmes winning over Muhammed Ali.  Right now, the only thing that seems to matter is whether the player is a higher-ranked or lower-ranked player (Gold vs Platinum, for example).  The other thing is that I sometimes feel players are using cheats, but there is no way to prove this, unfortunately.  Otherwise, I think this will be a great game for years to come as long as the developers keep adding new fighters with different styles of fighting.",1697914086,1697914086,True,2,1,0.490938514471054077,1,True,False,True

This game has a ton of potential, but throws it all away by not updating and fixing its most important mechanics. I have nearly 200 hours in this game and I'm quite good, but I'll often somehow lose a match that I'm dominating from a grazing punch that somehow knocks me out while I still have full health and stamina. This seems really easy to fix, but like most of the mechanics in this game, it's been mostly ignored by the developers. Button mashers can win simply because the stamina mechanic is essentially broken for several fighters, so they can just spam hooks without repercussion. 

The game simply doesn't feel even remotely realistic unless the opposing fighter also cares more about having an actual boxing experience than exploiting the nonsense that the developers have failed to correct. Scoring is also often comically bad, which seems like it should be relatively straightforward to implement. I've taken a couple month-long breaks from the game to see if it's better when I return, and nope. I imagine that any active developers on this are all busy working on the upcoming career mode, but what's the point when the base mechanics are so faulty? I tend to be very forgiving when it comes to early access games, but this has just felt like an enormous waste of my time. All of that said, I do certainly wish the developers luck in fixing this mess.

Review update September 21,2023
I'm not quite understanding some of the gripes from some people about this game. I've played this game inside and out and I honestly think it plays amazingly. And with the upcoming create a fighter and career mode beta coming soon this game is remarkable. Stupendous job developers!!!!






Updated October 7 2023
Hey developers what has happened to this game? It boots up just fine on my steam deck but when I go to choose my fighters then the venue it goes to load then crashes and reboots my deck. This game use to run flawlessly on my deck. Infact it ran so buttery smooth I was able to jack up the graphics to high and I was getting unbelievably high frame rates and now I can't even play. Please please please, developers fix this. This is my favorite go to game. Thanks



Updated October 17 2023

So to anyone with steam deck download cryoutilities if your game isn't running on steam deck. Anxiously awaiting create a player and career mode. I'm very excited for this.

1. jab takes too much energy. Its a range tool nerf the damage and take off most of stamina consumption it will be fine. 
2 AI stamina is OP. Like i threw 80% of shots to head and body AI did like 60% and i had less punches and ai bobbed and viewed like an idiot around still more stamina than me... i had this in so many fights its not even funny.
3. accuracy is broken to. Mostly when i punch after the dodge it allways for some reason misses..
4.Bodyshots... i dont know why i throw them cause stamina is broken...
5 Please bring back side damages like in  the first relesase, i dont see a point hitting a siide if it does not register as  part damage... + blocking is allso broken ... you can block for ages... make the block have holes cause AI keeps blocking but i see hooks could go trough... keep it fluid 


Other than that next best thing since fight night... just small things that need to be balached/ fixed

Other times, and this is with every fighter, your punches at times don't reach, even when you're only inches away from your opponent ( Ai doesn't have this issue at all. It only misses if you dodge or block ) my percentages were usually high 70s and 80s. I'm anywhere between 45 and 65 now. Hooks or overpowered, infact ridiculously overpowered. Uppercuts lol. I've stopped using them, pointless. Another step backwards regarding punch crispness. The slowness of some is unbelievable. Movement and punch output is basically the same for every fighter, just like on fight night, apart from the odd few. 

Still got that silly camera man at the WBC arena that's gets into the camera shot blocking action ( how they missed that I don't know ). Loading times, wow. I made a Sunday roast and it still hadn't loaded in lol. OK, not that bad but commodore 64 comes to mind. 

Boxers completely turning their backs. Boxers arms swinging around there backs. Sometimes locks you into a defensive block where you can't move. Knockdowns not registering on scorecards, scorecards are way off at times, way off. 

AI is way to easy, even on undisputed. All is does is spam roll and steps. You can still knock them out within 5 rounds. You can pick the worse fighter in any weight class  and beat the best fighter.

Personally, if you don't own this game, I wouldn't buy it until career mode has been out for atleast a month. Let us idiots who've already purchased it, give feedback to try and improve the game.",1675236924,1697024511,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

The mechanics often reward a passive, almost evasive style of play. In most of your matches, you'll find yourself either relentlessly pursuing your opponent around the ring or tossing awkward hooks that rarely connect. This is mainly because the punches are tied to your movement. Since you're constantly on the chase, your fighter rarely executes the way you intend.

Furthermore, the game misses the mark in replicating the vital aspect of pressure in boxing. The thrill of pinning an opponent in the corner or effectively smothering their offense is noticeably absent. Fighters can easily retreat at lightning speeds, effortlessly dodging any form of aggressive strategy. The whole experience becomes somewhat unsatisfying.

Yes, you could probably dedicate hours to mastering these quirky controls, but that begs the question: are you truly playing a boxing game at that point? It reminds me of the challenges FIFA has. You need to abandon all conventional knowledge of boxing to adapt to this game's unique, and arguably flawed, system. The outcome?

The graphics are top-notch, the controls are responsive, and the overall gameplay is engaging. It's evident that the development team poured their hearts and souls into this project, and they deserve praise for their dedication.

However, the shadow of cheating players looms large over this otherwise fantastic game. Cheaters are, unfortunately, an all too common sight in online gaming, and this boxing game is no exception. Their presence not only diminishes the enjoyment of honest players but also undermines the efforts of the talented programmers who have worked tirelessly to create this experience.

To those who choose to cheat in this game. Cheating not only ruins the fun for others but also detracts from the competitive spirit that makes online gaming so exhilarating. It's disheartening to see individuals resort to unfair tactics.

In conclusion, I have high hopes for this boxing game once it officially launches. It has the potential to be a real gem in the gaming world, thanks to the hard work and dedication of its programmers. Let's not let the actions of a few tarnish the reputation of the entire player base. It's time to come together, report cheaters, and ensure that this game thrives in an environment of fair and honorable competition. Only then can we truly appreciate the incredible effort that has gone into its creation.",1695778586,1695778711,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Fighter levels do not seem to count for anything as far as I can tell. From what I've found a fighter with a level of 88 or 77 will be almost even on stamina  throughout the fight.
Score cards do not reflect the fight, I've just fought the AI and connected with just over 400 hits, knock them down in the 6th, in every round I landed more punches, they only landed around 150 punch in the whole fight, yet two judge card had the AI winning 117 against 110, and the other judge card gave me the win with 115 against 112. Just how that works I do not know.
I've found the AI can slip punch after punch with ease, even when landing a combination such as landing a jab, then landing a right hook to the body, then followed by a left hook to the head, the left hook will be slipped, the slipping of left hooks by the AI I've found is so bad that I don't even throw that punch anymore as I've found almost every time it will be slipped and countered. 
A slip consumes stamina, at the start of the fight a slip will consume a lot of your stamina, yet an AI fighter can be down to about 30-40% remaining on their stamina bar yet they can slip three punches in a row, then on the last one hit you with a counter after slipping  and their stamina will only be down about halfway of their remaining stamina bar!
For me, I've also found that slipping is almost impossible to perform; clicking down on the left stick and flicking in a direction is awkward as hell, given the timing window you have to perform it in.
I get the game is going for a more simulation style boxing game over what Fight Night series was, but it still needs to be fun, and as much as I want to really enjoy this game, at the moment I find the balancing more annoying than fun.",1695757862,1695757862,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Punch damage and damage to the face and body is very poorly portrayed. As someone who has boxed my whole life and played many boxing/mma games this definitely needs to be fixed. In this game I have a great record online so I am not making excuses but out of around 100 online fights I have seen a cut or real swelling maybe 5 times and zero body bruising or effects other then maybe some drained stamina but not much. Outside of the damage complaints this is a great game and definitely the top when it comes to boxing games. I highly recommend this game and if damage could be properly portrayed this game would be legendary. 9.5/10 no doubt especially before any major updates but please get a good career mode added soon and fix damage and damage effects(visual).



Updated 9-24-23, game has got so much worse with recent updates. The realism has diminished, 250 hooks to someones head and they will be fine most times with a little redness. 200+ body shots and no effect other then a small loss of their stamina.

to instead give out participation trophies ( I thought we stopped that)

the stamina is atrocious.
no reason why a middle and lightweight should be tiring out at the same rate as a heavyweight.
the accelerated clock is a complete joke. (I'm guessing cause most mafkas gassed within the first 4 rounds they try to hide it by the first 10 seconds being normal, then speeds up to 1.5X)

Power punches don't pack the punch they should, as you can repeatedly connect with devastating blows without dazing your opponent. e.g I tried with Deontay Wilder I landed at least 6 punch back to back to body or head doesn't matter and my opponent still not dazed.

The daze system feels inconsistent. Sometimes a single power punch can knock out your opponent, while other times, it has no effect at all. When you're dazed, you feel helpless, unable to retreat or clinch your opponent. It often comes down to luck whether you can escape a knockout, and the animations for recovery are not smooth or helpful.

The diversity of heavyweight boxers in the game is lacking. While they keep adding new fighters, many of them share the same punching style. For instance, the jab of Usyk resembles that of Riddick Bowe, and signature animations for iconic heavyweights like Joe Frazier's left hook are impressive, but others like Usyk, Holmes, Bowe, Marciano etc lack distinctive moves. There's a noticeable absence of signature punches and unique styles for these fighters. Add Suzie Q for Marciano, Signature jab of Holmes and Bowe etc

In general, the game has potential, but it falls short of being a good boxing game due to these issues. More attention to detail in terms of gameplay mechanics and a wider variety of heavyweight boxers (we need all legends and modern heavyweights in the game) would greatly improve the overall experience.",1683418411,1695455038,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Full steam ahead we all owe a huge thanks to Steel City for stepping up and filing this gap. Thank you steel City! I pledge my allegiance



After online  play for awhile the game is heavily broken online we really need to work on things there the ko system is broke I've out boxed several opponents and hit them with heavy HEAVY hands with nothing...only to have my head touch their glove on a punch coming in that I threw ...and i get the ko effect? wtffff oh and If you only pick Strictly Ali or Tyson and only throw Lead Body Uppercuts ...Yikes ...Still Early Access lets get it smoothed out.



EDIT:I dont understand how to knock people out online I have been knocked out in the most ridiculous ways...I'll be throwing combo after combo and then they 1 hit daze me..I mimick what they do and I get knocked out.Countless times I've been the better boxer only to be power punched 3x in a row and dazed.Meanwhile I been landing multiple power punches.combos etc..The game doesn't make sense to me.I must just be bad at it but I legit can't make sense of it.I just feel like i'm fighting an Elden ring boss every match ..I'm getting knocked out by level 8 because my chin touched his glove on my hook animation ...his hands were in the resting state....help bad boxer

Update:The State of online is getting better with regular updates. The game is actively fixing itself with devs removing and adding features that may already exist but need to be fixed. Knocking people out isn't impossible. I enjoy seeing all the updates and it seems with each technical update there is always a new boxer release not too short behind it planned or not that's always nice. Keep up the good work and if your On the fence just get it ...with the update coming in the fall and online play to craft  your skills you'll be busy for sure.",1675512600,1695254182,True,12,1,0.585620701313018799,0,True,False,True

- Loading times are crazy long, especially for the tutorial I thought the game was stuck.
- In-fighting is really clumsy, kept having to step back to throw punches.
- After 5 minutes of waiting for an online ranked match, I couldn't press B to exit, had to force quit game.
- IMO focusing on refining the gameplay would be more beneficial than adding fighters, I can wait till final release for fighters like Mike Tyson but as it is now the game-play is just not fun.

I look forward to the next update and I hope to change my review then.

Let's break down what this game has to offer and where it can improve.

One of the initial letdowns for fans of the sport is the absence of iconic figures like Mike Tyson and Anthony Joshua from the roster. However, there's hope that these glaring omissions may be rectified through future updates or downloadable content (DLC). The anticipation of their inclusion adds an element of excitement for the game's future.

The gameplay, despite the game's early access status, is undeniably enjoyable. It offers players the flexibility to approach matches with various strategies. You can opt for a tactical approach, using well-timed jabs and defensive maneuvers to outwit your opponent. Alternatively, you can embrace the full fury of a toe-to-toe slugfest, trading blows to see who will crumble first. This versatility adds depth and replayability to the gameplay.

However, it's worth mentioning that the pacing of the fights can occasionally feel sluggish, which is somewhat unexpected for a sport as fast-paced as boxing. The boxers seem to lack the lightning-quick movements and the hard-hitting authenticity that would truly immerse players in the sport. This aspect deserves refinement to make the game feel more true to the real-life boxing experience.

One standout feature of Undisputed Boxing Game 2023 is the inclusion of legendary fighters like Muhammed Ali. Stepping into the virtual shoes of ""The Greatest"" is a nostalgic and thrilling experience, allowing you to channel his famous mantra: ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."" The roster, including fighters like Tommy Morrison, Vasyl Lomachenko, Tyson Fury, and Deontay Wilder, provides a diverse selection to choose from.

One notable drawback is the game's overreliance on online matches, which can lead to a repetitive gaming experience. The absence of a career mode is a glaring omission that needs urgent attention. The addition of a comprehensive career mode would undoubtedly enhance the overall appeal of the game, providing players with a deeper and more immersive boxing journey.

In its current state, Undisputed Boxing Game 2023 offers enjoyable gameplay with the potential for further refinement and content expansion. The absence of prominent boxing figures and the lack of a career mode are areas that require immediate attention. With future updates, including the addition of missing legends and the introduction of a career mode, this game could become a true contender in the world of boxing simulation. For now, it stands at a respectable 7.5, with the hope of reaching greater heights in the future. Boxing enthusiasts should keep an eye on its development and upcoming features.",1695203836,1695204291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1451190,146634523,76561198060377158,0,2,918,7,66,1708813060,"This may be kind of a mess but from the first hour here my notes.
Pros: 
Every fighter I have played as mimics the style of the actual fighter, from how they hold their hands, to their relaxes stance  
Visuals are amazing at ultra quality and game runs smooth as butter, details on fighters look amazing 
Good cast of fighters for early access, seeing most other reviews upset over certain fighters not on the roster, but will likely be added later 
Punch system reminds me of the Fight Night spectrum punch system
Cons/Notes for later:
Momentum- many moments of the fight were slowed mostly due to punches not having a lot of snap even for fighters known for speed. Punches do not have a lot of feedback making it lack a certain... punch really when landing big blows
Animations- would like to see more animations, such as when fighters go to their corner or winning a fight a certain way. The first two boxers I played as were Canelo Alverez and Deontay Wilder, and both reacted the same exact way to a win
Hit detection- punch system is good for pick up and play, but some punches seem to be stopped and glance off even if it was supposed to be a clean hit. May just be me, but I am seeing it in other reviews as well. Would also like to see more effects on fighters during the fight. While this feels like simulation boxing compared to an arcade style game, hitting your opponent over 100 times in the face and it not swelling or having a cut just doesn't help with the lack of feedback you feel when hitting your opponent 

Overall, this is off to a really good start. It's the first attempt at a mainline boxing game in over a decade. Reminds me of the days playing the Fight Night games with my brothers, and look forward to future updates. Would recommend to anyone big fans of boxing, who could also give the studio feedback to make this the best boxing game possible.",1695197938,1695197938,True,17,0,0.704202711582183838,0,True,False,True

These's NO Anti-Cheat - So YES everyone cheats and if they're not cheating they're abusing the broken mechanics of the game AND there's a LOT of broken going on.

There's NO career mode so your stuck with exhibition mode - and the AI SUCKS. It has 0 boxing intelligence and just spams everything.

I can't wait for EA to take advantage of this games weakness and just release a Fight Night and blow this wannabe out of here for wasting everyone's time.

Instead of putting an ati-cheat and career mode they just keep adding boxers. They can add Mike Tyson and I won't care because the overall game is broken and doesn't look like the developers are going to fix it. They're just going to ride this as long as they can take peoples money.

They even admitted in one post update that it would take a long time to implement an anti-cheat because they would have to rebuild the game to implement it... or something a long those lines. That was 6 months ago... still no date, or year, to when this anti-cheat will be implemented, or when they will put the career mode.

How did we go from an okay Beta to this mess of a game? 99% of this game is the online, which is unfun as everyone plays the same, no matter who they play due to the game's meta being around points and running without any way to punish it. Damage is a joke, getting gassed is even worse, there is no upside to being a heavy hitter, as someone can be in loose-movement for 100% of the game and never face any downside, a thing people have asked the Devs to fix since day one of EA, even in the Beta people pointed out that point scoring and movement seemed a little strong over the heavy hitter's ability to knock someone out.

I would not even buy this game for £5 if I hadn't not already brought it in good faith that any downsides would be quickly fixed. As, instead of doing that, they add fighters, more bugs and less fun to the game overall. Even offline, the game still feels like rubbish. 

No wonder I barely can play more than 1 or 2 games per update, and that is if one even loads after being in the screen for 20 mins and then 5 for the game to load itself... (online).

Undisputed had what I though was a pretty good launch in Feb 2022 since then the game has wholeheartedly stalled. The basic game play still needs a significant amount of work, punches/blocking/counters still do not work as fully intended, the game servers are terrible and almost always have bad connection, the ranked play system is bugged and has not been reset, and the game is full of cheaters which seem to be ignored.

Despite a few glaring bugs the game is essentially the same as when is was dropped.

Although I still like the game it is not the ""dope game"" I thought it was is 2022 and my high hopes up to this point have completely fallen flat. Today I would describe the game as mid.

original The Pros: 
* the graphics are well done, you can really grasp the weight behind the power punches, and the little details are not forgotten.  
* I WANT to say it's really responsive, however my controller is a POS (yay refurbished!), and I've been playing characters like Tyson Fury, so the slow response may just be my own bad decisions, in comparison to having my ass handed to me by the likes of players using Joe Frasier and Muhammed Ali, and the computer on easy.  Let's just say for now that it seems responsive for everyone *but* me, and that's okay too- if my response times are still crap in a month, I'll update this. 

months-later update: i've gotten the hang of it now, and it's not my crappy controller. it's just slow to respond. i box at my local gym... and Canelo here makes my snail-like reaction times look like actual Canelo's.

original The Meh:
* I've had a couple audio glitches (a sound track disappeared while the breathing overlay remained, instead of the other way around), but nothing really complaint worthy.
* Learning curve is a little steep, as there's a tutorial, but not a training mode (like having a trainer with mitts call and then catch your punches, such as like what Soul Caliber or Killer Instinct might have, showing the move, and letting you practice it over and over, using positive reinforcement when done right, like real world training), or sparring mode to practice moves on, unaided, without having to go a full match, both of which would've been really nice. 

update: i haven't seen any notable bugs as of late. training still is lacking.

original The Cons:
* Unfortunately, the controls aren't fully customizable, but you can choose between various pre-made settings. 
* The camera is a hindrance when you try to rotate your positioning, or if your opponent is, because it's really hard to tell if your far-hand hook is going to connect if someone is rotating, so a button-mashed hook (at too close, just right, and out of range) will result in three weak punches at best and misses at worst because they ALL look ""at the right distance""
* Stamina. I know both body shots and missed punches drain your stamina, but it seems like mine always drains faster than the other person's (refer to the previous point on missing far hooks).

update : i haven't messed with the controls since, so i don't know if they're any better. camera
 isn't any better. stamina, however, is much better compared to what it was - BUT, it can be cheesed with lots of body shots... and compared to real life, my fat ass can throw a continuous combo for 3 minutes straight in round 1, but i'm getting no more than a 5-6 punch combo before gasping for air by round 12: these boxers are gassing out in round 1 like i do in round 12 - stamina is nowhere realistic.

original: I'm still feeling my way around this, and will write a better review once my gloves feel a little lighter, and the heavy bag isn't kicking my ass more than my trainer is.

update : after some time of messing with it, while the AI may fall for a 1-2-3-2 like a person would, they're more inclined to rotate around you with their guard down, than they will block and counterpunch, and that's a little weird.",1678336455,1693883493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a solid base for a marvelous future boxing game, the first of it's kind on PC. Right now it's a beautifully animated and visually impressive title with a lot of interesting boxing mechanics that are based on how they actually work. However, there are a lot of issues. A LOT of issues. 

If you're considering to buy this game to play it for fun, you can forget about it. Single player mode is utterly boring due to the lack of career mode and rather subpar AI even on highest difficulty. Multiplayer is plagued with cheaters and spammers and you'll find yourself facing the same few boxers (depending on weight class of course) over and over again and not playing as them yourself means shooting yourself in the leg. This is especially true in ranked. 

However, there is potential here. Wishlist it, wait for 6-12 months. If the basis, which is solid, is followed by necessary improvements and additions then we'll have a real gem of a boxing game on our hands.

I have now clocked many more hours than I had since I had last reviewed the game. Now I can confidently say that I do NOT recommend this game at all. There are QUITE a few issues I will go over in the review so stick around. 

Undisputed had a lot of hype coming into EA. Especially after what I would consider a VERY successful beta run. We saw a boom in sales when the game dropped hitting a few thousand players along with large streamers and youtubers playing it such as MoistCritikal. With that being said, the game has changed since then and a lot of it are bad changes. 

First off. The elephant in the room. The online playability. This games playability is laughable at best right now. The desync is now so bad in the game that most people actually have 2 different matches going on resulting in 2 different scores on the scorecards. How is this even possible when the devs claim to have done TWO patches for the desync! The online performance can be very buggy/laggy at times as well resulting in some rubber banding and some sliding across the canvas like the other fighter has a hover board under his feet. This makes for a VERY VERY poor experience. 

Hackers/Cheaters. 

Around the 2nd week of this game. We saw cheaters and hackers come into the game, with menus giving the ability of immortal, to 1 punch KO to even infinite stamina or never go down. Meaning even when you do get lucky and have minimal desync and lag. The chances of you running into a cheater are pretty high. What makes it worse is that SCI has claimed long ago that an anti cheat was coming but we rarely ever hear about it these days because they rarely seem to work on it. Why not get Easy Anti Cheat or BattlEye ?????


Game Problems 

This game started off great. The accuracy was decent, punches felt a little weak but with tweaks could be better, Stamina was ok. That was beta though. Now it seems like SCI cater towards the casual gamer. Punches are VERY weak, pillow like. If you have a good plan you can have like near full stamina for most of the match and punches are way too accurate at times. I have no idea why SCI ever ended up changing stuff when it was already good. Of course there are punch spammers and animation glitches. Dont get me started with them REMOVING FEINTS  because they were ""creating issues"" and we still havent seen clinching in online play yet as well. 

Boxer updates are just so random at times with sometimes no IRL correlation behind it. Why is Tyson Fury still so OP in this game? Why is Fury better than Ali? Why are the ratings how they are? Nobody knows. I like to say that they have a little bit of bias when it comes to fighters as some things simply make no sense but I could be wrong there. 

Content

Apart from a couple of new venues and a couple of boxers and maybe some boxers that arent even pro yet (Addam  Hamed) theres really nothing to do apart from AI Fighting. There is offline fighting but the AI isnt that good and is pretty easy to beat and read. There is also those weekly challenges but those are also boring and somewhat easy as well. So you really are stuck with online as the game. 


With all of that said. There are even MORE problems that I dont really want to get into as I dont want to make the review any longer. This game doesnt really have anything good to do right now as I feel like the devs are at the point where their inexperience is starting to bite them in the butt. They bit off more than they could chew. I do NOT recommend this game as its just too bare bones right now.

I was sorely disappointed by the graphics in undisputed, FIght Night Champion looks , practically just as good , and it is a 10+ year old game. That is inexcusable. Also, you could simply download an emulator like RPS3 , and grab the ISO of Fight Night Champion for PS3, and see for yourself. This game plays worse than a 2011 game, looks worse, controls worse, and it doesn't even have Lennox Lewis or Mike Tyson.

They have one of the biggest rosters ever, and no Lennox Lewis? That was my favorite boxer to play in the Fight Night series, and he is nowhere to be seen.

Ali seems small , weak, and slow, and his model looks worse than Fight Night's. 

All this, and it takes far more resources on your computer than just running a PS3 emulator.

1. A barren game with, essentially, ONE single-player mode: quick-play. I don't consider the other two as separate game modes: a practice mode and a daily ""challenge mode"" with identical features and presentation to quick-play but with added insignificant conditions like fewer than three fouls allowed.
2. Unplayable online; players cheese the gameplay mechanics and, worse, use hacks.
3. The game is buggy, glitchy, janky, and unbalanced.
4. A drip feed of updates and an ignored road map; career mode, create-a-fighter, and fighter customization are missing nearly eight months later. Without them, there is simply nothing to do or reason to play beyond a few hours.

Ignore the fanboys' excuses: ""The devs clearly state it's in Early-Access."", ""It's a small company, give them some slack."", ""It's the only game of its kind nowadays."", etc. This attitude is why companies abuse the ""Early Access"" moniker and push out unplayable and unfinished products.

- on a lot of instances, both players are seeing different things on their screen... e.g. player-1 is seeing he's hitting all his punches, while player-2 is seeing player-1 punching nothing but air, and yet the round gets won by player-1... sometimes player-1 is seeing player-2 literally at the other side of the ring, and then suddenly gets knocked down/out...

You get the same dead person looking KO every knockdown. sometimes slow UI. i think there are bugs with the actual boxing itself. Bugs with the AI.

I'm talking Atari 2600 and Star Rank Boxing on C64. Sierra Championship Boxing (anyone remember that one?) Fight Night (Accolade not EA) and on and on. You name an obscure boxing game and not only have I played it, but I probably dedicated ridiculous amount of hours to it.

Even in its EARLY ACCESS Undisputed is the best boxing game I've ever played. It's embarassing to read some of these reviews by people who I imagine must have been born last week to not see how this wonderful EARLY ACCESS game is well on its way to becoming one of the best sports games ever created, It simply feels like real boxing (yes, I've done tons of that too.) Too many subtle aspects of the sport are here and this is an obvious labor of love for the development team.

Online has issues. Of course it does. It's EARLY ACCESS. My advice is do the weekly Prize fights with the AI. They are well though out matches where it pays to fight in the style of your real life fighter. Wonderful stuff. There is simply no way on earth to better recreate Gatti-Ward than this game. This fight alone is worth the cost of admission.

While one would expect that significant updates could improve the game, each successive update has actually been worse than the previous one.

Personally, I'm looking for a career mode that allows me to create my own fighter and compete against other players.

Still fucking trash.

4 online games in a row with Red internet bar. Opponent just runs backwards in circles and wins. Stupid game. Shit devs

New Edit - 3/5 with about 38 hours

Games trash, Literally no changes by Devs. Adding more characters when 95% of online community chooses 1 character (Doesnt matter who, Just top stat)

Dev communication is next to 0 with community on forums

Weekly updates has turned into every other week

Stability is jackshit, 99,9% of matches are Red bar network cause its p2p servers 

Just overall, Scam Early Access

Invisible punches causing rocked status
followed up by
invisible punches knocking you down

Literally go rounds without getting touched, then opponent throws 3-4 hooks, apparently there is 5-6 going on and I get rocked. Then as im blocking high, 0 punches are thrown on my screen yet I get hit in body and go down.

Game is so bad. Even the stuff I like is completely drowned by how bad the ultimate outcomes are.

hittin 1-2's, step punching, slips, all are fun and enthralling. Then the invisble/non registering shit happens and ya fucking game is trash.

Few days ago I faced someone where in round 7, Literally every punched rocked me. Straight, hook, body jab, All of it sent me to rock status. Then Any punch knocked me down. 

He wont by ko (go figure) fight stats afterwards showed me land around 50% punches, opponent around 22%. 

Game is seriously trash. 

Judges, over and over and over, vote 2-1. 2 judges always on same page, 1 is at outlier. Makes you feel something...till you realize its same outcome each fight.

Game is seriously trash.

How about ""These guys have been going at it on social media!"" when its Ali vs Frasier... ... ...............................

Game is seriously trash

original post

I want to enjoy this game.
There are a massive lack of fighting games.

But 90% of my shots just ""go through"" the opponent.

Hooks that dont even swing full rotation, hooks that just go through opponent head, controls you cant custom (And i use a ps4 remote and config is for xbox) 

I guess thats why its early access... but all games are early access now. 

Hopefully they can do this one thing right for a boxing game... which is land punches.

Oh and the judges in this game are as bad as judges in real life. I had a match vs AI where I landed 600 of 1000 shots, ai landed 100 of 300. 

Not only was no damage shown, but they won the match lol.",1675537227,1692066072,False,2,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,True

This is currently only in beta so many features are yet to be released for it such as career mode.

its made by a local to me (Sheffield) indie developer which i think sometimes goes unbeknown as many people think and expect this kind of game to be made by AAA Studios.

graphics are great, game play is reminiscent of fight-night, it has a great selection of local Sheffield boxers (Johnny Nelson, Kel brook, smith etc) and many other greats like fury, Muhammad ALI ETC.

The games not the finished article, lots of things to improve on such as cut scene animations for more realism, more boxers i.e Mike Tyson etc. more venues albeit i do love the fact it has magna centre a local Sheffield boxing venue.

I think my biggest two gripes with the game which are both easily fixed are, punches are some times soft needs a bit more damage done when connecting the right punch. 
 And again with punches but also the fact that landed punches don't seem to have as much effect on fight results, i played online and absolutely schooled my opponent landing twice as many hits but he won the fight, i can only assume because he landed a few more counter punches which seem to be rewarded far too much. like i say these are easily changed by the developers.

i think boxing and gaming fans need to back steel city interactive, purchase this game, put up with the things not great in order to provide funding for them to perfect the game because it has big potential.",1691932859,1691932859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can tell at first glance that they don't have the ambition or resources necessary. We're talking about an indie dev studio's first game, after all lol.

dodging does nothing. you cant slip without getting hit. you just have to walk out of range.

First of all, the roster is cool with some really good graphics and realistic animations etc. The fights are fun, making you feel good when you get a good counter or dodge. It is fun to play.

On the other side it needs a lot of work. Being early access it is understandable. I would like to some more added to the roster. As well a career mode which is coming. Plus a possible selection on the venue and things would be cool. The game needs more balancing in the fights with Tyson Fury just destroying you with a jab and hook when you cannot get close at all. Plus the point system is not great.

The scoring... drives me crazy!  If i land 50 punches on 58% efficiency and my opponent land 56 with 49% , there's no way they should take the category just because they landed a few more punches than me.  it makes no sense to me. should i not be rewarded for my efficiency. For picking my punches wisely or just simply boxing smarter.
  Another thing..Unless I've just been running into cheaters, I also don't like how much your stamina drops from body shots.  Even when your blocking them. i can understand clean lands, counters, or power punches but even those shots should take a small amount...but regular punches thrown at my arms (I.M.O.) should only move a tiny bit until your block meter starts to deplete. Maybe another exception could be if the puncher has a specific trait..Or maybe even if the puncher has a high punch power matched with the punch-ee  having low body resistance, low bloc health, and/or low guarding. There's another thing when it comes to blocking that irritates my soul. That is, when certain fighters block to the body, the game allows head punches to be blocked by this action as well.  which is why some us struggle against fighters like Ray Robinson. When this... (lets just call it a glitch) when this glitch is performed and its coupled with the speed and power from a guy like that, its as if a draw is as good as a win.
Other than connection issues and winning from a quit not going toward your record as a KO.. there isn't much else to cry about. of course  there's small things i would like to see added or changed but you can nitpick ANY game to death if you really want to..

  With that being said i am beyond ready to get the official version of the game or at the very least an announcement. And my god would'a it be nice to get career mode or spice up the prizefighter mode. when i get tired of fighting runners or CHEESErs and cheaters i have no option but to fight them anyway or quick fight with a preview sample of the commentators. which gets annoying and takes away from the immersion.

Good Job to the DEV. team at steel city (i always think Pittsburgh, PA when i hear that name)  for all they've done to this point. Cant wait to see all the other fighters that'll be in the Official Release and what other surprises you all have in store for us. its been over 10 years w/o a boxing sim and I'm grateful to have this.. 
Good Luck

Here's the deal. This game has the worst community I've ever seen in my life, loaded up with chest beating wannabe Andrew Tates with egos more fragile than an egg. And those people are the loudest complainers, most of those complaints being 'why don't I get to win?"" So for the past 6 months or so, the devs have been steadily worsening what was supposed to be a simulation experience all in service of making it easier for the weakest and least intelligent players to stand there like a bag of sand. Damage has been nerfed to the point of being meaningless, and you regularly go the distance with players who have no business making it past round 4. The devs claim that low damage is appealing to a wider player base, which is not at all supported by the game's anemic player count. Additionally, the online functionality is...not. The game has wicked desync and punch stats favor the host, which seems to switch off between every round so regardless of what happens, the round winner tends to alternate. When you're not the host, although you may be throwing punches, they're not recognized by the game and thus, do not count for you. So, scorecards are meaningless and knockouts are a virtual impossibility if both players block even a little.

The thing is, to play the game, there's a lot to like, on paper. and earlier on in its life, they really had something here. But as I feared would happen, the game's destiny was subverted by its worst players, who Steel City Interactive view as their target audience so, I've lost a lot of faith in the game's direction. They've taken all of the strategy, all of the thinking, all of the...fun out of it to appease a casual audience that they never had and, at this rate, never will.

I get wanting to make a realistic boxing game but this is still a video game and there should be some sort of focus towards entertainment, inside fighting, mid range fighting and getting the finish within 3-5 rounds in most fights. 

Not making it extremely easy for literally anyone to run around for 12 rounds or until you've bored your opponent straight to sleep. Anytime a fight goes past 7-8 rounds I don't even care if I'm winning or not, I'm ready to play something else. 

Also you don't even have to run around for a fight to go that long. You can fight in spurts at close range and you'll still more than likely last at least 7 rounds. Body shots feel like they do nothing to slow fighters down except let them recover less stamina between rounds which basically has no effect when punches are being thrown. 

Don't get me started on the button layout either. It's terrible. It feels like there isn't enough buttons on the control to fully utilize your fighter to their maximum potential. 

It takes 3 buttons, that you pretty much have to have your fingers on the whole game, just to block. While also controlling movement, slips, throwing your own punches and the power modifier. 

Im a huge boxing fan. I remember when they first announced the game on twitter a few years ago I couldn't wait to play it. It was even the first game I bought on my pc. But after playing it the first time I returned it after not really liking it. Then I came back and bought it again just because I thought maybe I didnt give it enough time but no it really is that bad. I wish I could get another refund at this point.

seeing how i watch alot of old boxing footage, if UNDISPUTED wants to knock EA""s 12 yr old game off the throne(lets be clear im loving this game) and not get sewed for false advertising and claim to be ""simulation"", well then their coding and complexity of intricate detailed aspect of boxing must be addressed. we already know the music, venues, clothes, and BOXERS blah blah but what about attention to detail. guessing the clench wasnt just thrown in for no reason so im expecting there to be some inside body and head/rabbit punches, holds, redirection of urs and ur opponents momentum and most importantly the REF FROM WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WONT BE A FACTOR WHICH WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER. if they cheap out like EA and say they cant program a person that just circles the fighters gives warnings and breaks up the holds this will be yet another fight night clone, wheres mills lane. NOW the corner minigame in between rounds has to be challenging and rewarding to where ur corner test u, the ringside doctor will test u if u seem out of it, and will stop the fight if u dont pass. when this game comes out ppl will immediately say ""well fight night had this"" but will people say they didnt have this an that? welp rn only true boxing ppl care not one ufc or casual gamer. ///gotta  take alil control outta users hands to where if ur on the other side of the ring u wont swing like no boxer has ever done or at least the option. im telling u just lil things make the biggest difference, when u pick a player there should be generations to choose from not just one version, their rivals,toughest fights, where they like and dont like to fight. how about build a fight venue maker, design custom belts. there needs to be 100 500 1000 idk real boxing fans that can take a small test to have an opinion on these fighters stats becuz frank bruno 40-5 38 knockouts and he aint 88 just 79. even if u dont care what the fans think just being in a exclusive club boom. i wanna spread this game  but my cousins ask what it has that EA aint bring welp good graphics aint enough. well this is my review i wont even talk about how underutilized the D pad is or how theres no risk reward at all it just feels like trying to out position each other to see who gets the fastest and or hardest hits in, there has to be somthing big that everyone can use but comes at a steep price",1679753005,1691071640,False,1,1,0.514563083648681641,1,True,False,True

But all and all I Give it a Score of 6 out of 10 and just one more thing to mention Where is Rocky Marciano Finisher The Suzie Q A Hard Heavy Straight that would Knock You Out of The Ring anyways there is a lot that I could Say that they can improve on in the Game like the Entrances each Fighter should walk the whole venue and Step into the ring and the Knockouts should be more Realistic They should Get up from where they got knockdown from Hopefully the Developers of The Game would make each Fighter More Realistic and make the Game a lot better and Gameplay of each Fighter More Realistic The only Fighter That I See That is to a T and Very Realistic on how he Fights in the Game is Muhammad Ali take care peace out Charbel Grech,1690988611,1691050590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For me, I have always enjoyed fighting games to either fight AI or to fight against a friend who is over at my house. My first complaint is the fighter selection. Obviously it will improve, but how can you have Ali and not Tyson? Mayweather? nope. Ok, benefit of the doubt, you will fix it. Despite the recent update claims, I still found AI doing nothing every once in a while. Personally I like creating characters, careers or some kind of dynasty in my sports games...none of which is currently available. The game has been out 6 months...this should have been included for use offline from day 1. At least let people have the full ai experience. I didn't bother to mess with the online mode as every game always has multiple issues with online fighting which can only go away between 2 people with a gentlemens agreement. For that reason, I place no weight on the complaints regarding online play, this is a well established issue for fight games. The last thing I will complain about is the AI skill levels. I went from amateur to intermediate to pro and the only change was the speed and amount of movement form the AI..no actual boxing skill increase, especially when not being technical. 

Lots of potential, but this one is a red flag for lack of development for me.

I SO wanted to love this game, and at first I did.

I think at its core its the best boxing game ever released which is no mean feat really, since FNC came out what 12 years ago? You can actually fight in a few different ways and have enough success to keep it fun. (Im never a guy who chases a meta) The roster is pretty good and supposedly going to be absolutely massive with some big names coming. Fighters actually feel different with all the different perks. Some of the ratings seem pretty wacky, but what do I know. 

Having said that the Desynch problems ruin the game, simple as that. Just like most PC games, cheating is somewhat rife (although I dont think as much as the community think, I think people are blaming cheating for what is actually desynch problems). They still cant figure out what to do with a few things, body uppercut spam for example. 

Most of this Im sure will be ironed out but the desynch thing scares me. Can they fix it? I've see quite a few games I really wanted to play ruined  by poor p2p connectivity. 

Here's to hoping that the console release (if it ever happens, I know its early access but the player count is scarily low) fixes that.",1675355966,1690564428,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The developers have been fairly consistent in updating every few months, so it feels like progress really is being made towards a full release.

Really my only complaint is that the game is still missing important game modes (a story mode or build your own fighter mode) and the gameplay still needs a few more tweaks. These fixes are promised to come but have yet to be delivered as of the middle of 2023. But for what its worth, Undefeated is a much needed boxing game after so many years without having one!

I don't think that I have played more than 2 online games in a row without playing someone with obvious cheats.I just had a fight as Tyson Fury and my opponent was Muhammad Ali and after the 3rd Round, my opponent turned on his cheats and dazed me with every punch! Even jabs! And they didn't even throw a single power punch! And they stopped even blocking!. And if it's not the cheaters; it's the players that surrender or disconnect their internet.  The only real fun to be had is online because there isn't a Career mode and the CPU opponents are punching bags! Even on the highest difficulty!

I'll apologize in advance; you will inevitably get matched up with an opponent who is WAY WAY more experienced than you. I have almost 400 fights under my belt and I routinely get matched up with 0-11 fighters....  

This game also needs to expedite getting more boxers.

I haven't ever boxed a pro fighter in a ring, but if I had the absolute dog hockey beat out of me, I wouldn't be so quick to roar back when the AI tells me to

Heavy hitters were slower but 1-2 good Haymaker or 1 Counter Haymaker and you literally knocked out a boxer's soul.

The hit system is bull shit in my opinion, because other box games or even MMA games also work without it, you have as a player leaning, what is really bad done in the game and blocking, why should you give then still hit chances, I understand for example. if you don't hit good evasive opponents who dodge with leaning, like in real boxing too, but sometimes the blow doesn't hit if you are exactly on it and the frontal to one stands, I think the focus to make an elite realistic game loses the focus, what players want is of course fun, I have e.g. no desire to start a career when my leek boxer can't even hit a 5 meter wide wall, it has a very good approach, but needs a lot of work in animation and also in dynamics, all boxers feel similar, are about the same fast and also equally strong, the damage is simply not noticeable in the game you make,

I have looked extra at bonus properties every time, then I play a boxer with 20% more damage with power strokes, I hit a perfect PowerHook and what happens to the opposing boxer is just 2-3 combo punches in me purely wtf?!?!, simply fearless, at fight night it was always like that, when the cpu noticed that he got a real bang that went right back in front of fear, the leaning is simply mega useless, the opponents always meet:D, at fightnight I could win without blocking just with leaning, through good timing and the stamina problem is just a joke, no matter how much I try and really try my best in me most games by decision, in my eyes the following aspects should be improved, changed or completely rebuilt

- Animation
- Damage/Hit
- Dynamics (Speed, Heavy Hitting)
- Effects (bleedings, co-replays, sound effects at heavy hits)

I just can't get a feeling right now at the game, I will keep trying because the developers patch regularly and try to I know it is also somewhere a taste thing, but I as Fight Night Fanboy, just miss this satisfying way of playing that I am really falling on the opponent, thick counter, good dodge, this fast play mechanism and dynamics, that I am my boxer as player as he is speed boxer(outboxer) many fast combos and counter, Heavy Hitter (insideboxer) pushing and try land big hits, at the moment everything feels so stiff unfinished.

I don't want to say with the review that game is more complete crap, but if you were Fight Night player or loved the Fight Night series and expected the same here you are unfortunately wrong (currently).

The whole review is designed for my taste and preferences, so I would advise everyone to watch gameplay videos.

The developers even have a roadmap I also believe that you have planned all this well only unfortunately I do not think that the game becomes as a game as I wish",1677108353,1689616673,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The amount of updates developer team pushed out is incredible. Graphics are amazing! Gameplay is already pretty good, but it gets better with every new update.

I haven't  played online, so I can't give my thoughts on this part of the game. Single player, this is amazing game which will please every boxing/mma fan! Finally, we have great combat simulation game on PC!

I noticed that there is AI bug on Pro difficulty though. AI will get unresponsive randomly for about 1 minute but I am sure the dev team will address this in upcoming updates. This was not an issue 2 months ago. Another thing that dev team should fix (although it is much better right now then on launch) is the stiff feeling of boxers upper body. Game like Fight Night Champion feels much more natural when it comes to boxer animations for upper part of body. I am optimistic however, since the stiff feeling was much more obvious when game launched.

Fighter roster and arena selection has gotten much bigger in the last 4 months, it's really impressive. Gameplay is really quite fun, counters/power/stamina is now much more realistic. I found myself playing this game more than EA UFC 4 in the last 2 months. 

Would recommend this game easily! I would rate it 8/10 at current state. If the game keeps improving like it was for the last couple of months, it will easily be 9.5-10/10 by the end of 2023.",1689549730,1689549730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, unless you're willing to play offline/singleplayer vs. AI only, I would not recommend this game at its current state (there is no career mode as of yet btw, but i guess it may be added by the end of the year). 

Online ping and lag issues are atrocious, and that is an understatement. Most players are forced to play with upwards of 2000ms ping and 1000-1200ms is actually considered good as of now (god bless the player base and the community for putting up with this). You will get rocked by invisible punches as you are unable to defend yourself and your opponent is immobile on your screen, standing 5 feet away from you. It is funny for a while, but the charm of seeing your fighter slumped on the floor from punches that came from the 4th dimension wears off about 3 to 4 fights in. However, for the purpose of transparency, i did have one fight where the ping was ok (2-3 connection bars filled out of 5 and highlighted in yellow instead of red) for about 80% of the fight's duration. 

Apparently devs have servers only in the UK (that's what reddit says, I couldn't be bothered to research these inconsequential details that i have no control over anyway). But it's funny how the game was released globally. But that's the Early Access malarkey for you. ""It's just a prank (read: early access) bro! Calm down, its gonna get fixed eventually."" Yeah, maybe, maybe not. 

Don't get me wrong, i'll still keep playing this game, maybe not as much as I want to, but I'm not going to uninstall it or anything. And, I'm going to be playing online exclusively, at least till they drop a career mode. But that's only because boxing is the love of my life, it carried me through a tough childhood and gave me a purpose, made me disciplined and forged me into a better man. However, had that not been the case (hypothetically, per se) and I had bought this game to play it like any other game, I would have had no qualms in refunding it by now.

At this point ive played enough to know that if it was between this and UFC ill be sticking to UFC.

Animations are dog, damage system is dog, bleed system is dog, stamina system is dog.

Oh we finally got replays for knockouts.. in singleplayer... that last for about half a second.

To the devs - please stop doing interviews talking about how great you are and fix your game. The main thing that will make this game a success is the online, which just so happens to be the main and worst part of the game so far.

Ive repeated countless cheaters and have come across one I reported last month, their record is 520ish wins - 30ish losses - 10ish draws.

Surely its not that hard to go through reports daily, every other day or even once a week.

Its a shame this could be an AMAZING game with the partnerships and such, at the moment however it isnt worth picking up in its current state. 

Hopefully in a few months ill be changing the review back to positive.

Overall - if you are on the fence about buying this, id say dont and hold off until its got a few more significant updates under its belt. If you can, play UFC, its much better than this at the minute.",1676634476,1689399689,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has an insane amount of bugs and glitches (glitches that are abused by players) don't even get me started on the cheaters you'll win 11 rounds and they'll knock you you out with a single jab and win. The game is insanely biased to certain fighters. More than half of the players are unplayable if you actually want to climb ranked.  The worst part is the desync everyone who plays fighting games knows how annoying desyncs are and while for other games it is a rare occurrence for undisputed this happens every other game. You will get knocked out by ghost punches. Honestly only scratching the surface. Really up to the devs if they want this game to actually be playable or not.

I only got this game because im a long time boxing fan and they have a big fresh roster coming and visually it looks great except where it matters during combat. The footwork and idle animations are of their own unique motion capture which is great. But again the core of the matter is the gameplay and its mediocre.

Can definitely tell Fight Night heavily inspired the punching system. One could honestly step right out of Fight Night and know the basic fundamentals of gameplay. I know this is beta which is why I feel this has great potential. The character models look fantastic, and much improved over Fight Night Champion, BUT some of the hair textures look rough. Tommy Morrison's hair looks like it was taken off an action figure. Improved hair textures and flow would be a major improvement. Another thing is the punches feel weak. Kind of like punching in a dream, slamming fist against a pillow. I hate to keep referring to Fight Night but its really the only thing to compare to. In this aspect it is highly superior in feel to Undisputed. The roster I know is being added to with each update, but I can't express enough how much this game needs Mike Tyson to feel like a true boxing game. Everyone who's a boxing gamer loves putting Tyson vs Ali. The only thing comparable to this on Undisputed is Marciano vs Ali. To end my criticism, the last improvement i'd suggest is everything overall just feels too stiff. I have an extreme amount of faith that this can be one of the best boxing games ever made with enough love and tweaking. I doubt any of this will be read by developers, but great job guys, keep up the good work.

~Need to have more animations before the fight (such as the whole ring walk, taunts)
~Need to prolong the fighter's introductions to hype the user up!!! PS: please have the red corner(champion) to be introduced last and the blue(challenger) corner first.
~Need to add more dialogues for the commentators AND also please have them say the fighter's name not ""fighter"".
~Need to optimize the game especially the camera movements.
~Need to add more fighters
~Need to add more injuries to fighters during fights, thisll add emotions and exciting to the user

There are some MAJOR issues that need to be resolved before this will ever be a game that i can seriously play competitively. 

That being said the game is in early access and hopefully some of these issues will be fixed in the coming months. But until then unless your hardcore combat sports fan there wont be much for you to sink your teeth into here. 

A few pros before i get into the issues with the game,

-The footwork and movement in general is by far the best of any combat sports game including the ufc titles

-The graphics are easily the best of any combat sports game currently on the market.

-The game play is very satisfying, counters feel visceral and heavy.

-Matchmaking is generally fairly good, though there are some problems once in a while.

Now on to the much bigger list of issues i have with this game. 

1. The servers need some serious fucking work. It is ridiculous how bad the lag can be in a game at this price point. 
(No it isn't me i have 250/Mbs down)

2. Cheating is a problem. There is either no anti cheat or it is not working as intended, i have 6 ranked losses and 2 of them are due to blatant cheating. 

3. The fighter roster is relatively small and there are only a few weight divisions, if you a fan of specific divisions or boxers the chance they are in the game at this time is fairly low. 

4. This game was advertised, at least by youtubers promoting it, as a sim or at least as a realistic fighting game. This is just not the case, If you were hoping for something like simulation stamina with no HUD from ufc undisputed 3 this isn't it. The game is very similar to fight night champion, although more refined and with far better footwork. 

5. The judging in this game is frankly, embarrassingly bad for a game at this price point. You can never be sure if you won a round, damage almost seems to be a non factor. If you land more punches, you usually win. Regardless of their impact, or if they are counters, or if you get rocks. As i mentioned above i have 6 ranked losses, 2 are to obvious cheating, 3 are to the awful scoring, and one was a KO. There are also fights i was sure i lost, or that i thought might have been a draw, that i ended up winning. Overall its incredibly frustrating, and makes it hard to want to play ranked or improve at the game, because its not clear what improving actually is when you lose fights you thought you clearly won.  

6. Spamming is a serious problem. Because of the aforementioned issues with scoring a round can be won purely by spamming 50 jabs and 50 straights to the body, even if they are mostly blocked, and aren't power shots. The devs added a arm fatigue system to try and solve the problem but that only stopped people from spamming the exact same punch. now as long as you throw a straight after every 3 jabs you can still spam just fine.

7. The damage is still way too low. It has been raised in some way or another at least 3 times since the game came out in February IIRC, and it is still very hard to even rock people. Let alone knock them down, there are fights where i have landed 200+ counters and 200+ power shots without a single rock. Almost every fight will go to a decision, even if you are significantly better than your opponent. 

8. The clock speed, This game does not have an accelerated clock like the modern ufc games do, which I wouldn't have a problem with if you could actually knock people out. But because as i mentioned above the damage is so pitifully low that's not a thing that happens often, That means that nearly every fight you have will last well over 30 minutes of real time. Which just makes going on to lose a fight you clearly won even more aggravating. 

This game has the potential to be the best boxing game ever released, but its myriad issues are preventing that potential from shining through. This game easily could be a 10/10 but in its current state i cant give it more than a 6/10, and i am a hardcore combat sports fan. I would stay away from this one until some of the problems get solved, if your a combat sports fan maybe check back in a few months.

I feel the need to update this review seeing as its been several months since i posted it originally and i had hopes some of the problems i listed would be addressed. The devs have released multiple updates but have not fixed a single one of the problems listed. Their most recent update claimed to fix multiplayer sync but in reality made it significantly worse. The game is literally near unplayable online and there is no sign of a career or any notable offline content being added in the near future. The dev team seems to have no intention of raising the damage or fixing the scoring either, and would rather focus on adding boxers no one cares about, or changing the minutia of how the fucking perk system works. 

If any undisputed devs that actually give a shit are reading this, revert the sync patch, and increase the fucking damage. You should not have youtubers recommending people to do custom fights so they can increase the damage by 3-5x just to make the game enjoyable. The level of out of touch this dev team is, borders on the level of riot games.",1680146630,1688884972,False,5,0,0.547320008277893066,0,True,False,True

a few things:

Need better ragdolls. Knockouts aren't TOO bad, but could definitely be worked on.
Some punches feel super, like straights on some fighters.
Most importantly. REPLAYS. We want replays for knockouts, just as if you were watching boxing, they would show replays of the knockout. 
Also need more animations for when someone was to get off the canvas. If i knock someone down in the corner, there's no way they're going to somehow end up in the middle of the ring.

Feel free to add things in comments, its just some feedback and stuff they could work on.

Also, add Naoya Inoue if you can. :D

If you are from EU don't even bother. Most of your games will be against NA and you're never going to be able to get any sort of rhythm going because every fight has the equivalent of 5k+ MS. Nobody in EU seems to be playing this, just USA, Mexico, Brazil. The host alternates in 2023, it's pathetic.

I know we've been waiting for a boxing game for a while, but this aint it, sorry.

Again - IF YOU ARE EU DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL THEY ADD DEDICATED SERVERS, or at least career mode for offline play.

The fact that this was released when the only mode available is online play (at the time of writing no career) without dedicated servers is a crime. 

2. The developers are obviously trying to emulate NBA2k - far more interested in posting cringe TOP 5 K.O videos on their Youtube than actually fixing the game, probably why flash K.O's are still in ranked. It looks cool in their marketing material. 

They even hired a discount Ronnie 2k to be the face of the game, can't make this shit up go check out their socials.

3. The cheating is nearly on the same level as NBA2K on PC once you get past plat in Ranked. It's absolutely rampant. 

Early Access is no excuse, you are charging $30+. PC players are testers for the console release. If there's any justice in this world the game will flop before it ever gets to that point.

I recommend you don't touch this game at all, but if you have to just wait for the console release. Maybe you'll get to mess around in career for a bit, though judging by the rest of the game that's either going to take many years or the offline will be just as trash as online. 

DO NOT BUY.

(1) I do think the stamina does drain a bit too fast. Especially for the lighter weights which are known for volume punching. 

(2) Since we do have throwback era boxers, we should have the option for a 15 rounder accompanied by an bland near black and white throwback arena. (Joe Louis Era)

(3) Not only do we need a career and create a boxer option.  We also need boxer editor.  As to my knowledge Joe Louis never wore purple shorts, plus he should be rated accordingly, considering he is in the top 3 heavyweights of all time. 

(4) The Mini-Game of getting up after a knockdown needs to be optional. Rapidly pressing a button or two is fine.  We're all here for the boxing game, not the chase the bars mini-game. It's overkill and does not add any excitement and / or entertainment value.",1688702167,1688702167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Might think otherwise later but for now I had a lot of fun playing online, trying to sneak in a punch or two after the bell and getting absolutely smoked by my opponents.

One big thing missing right now is any sense of progression beyond getting better at playing the game. Would be great to have even just a tournament of some kind where you could play multiple matches for a belt, while waiting for a more fleshed out career mode.

Overall I don't see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours in its present state but perhaps with more sense of progression that could change. Can't wait to see where this game is going",1688670153,1688670153,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you want to play online don't bother, the online connection is terrible, every fight is unplayable (UK). the input lag on this game is horrendous. If you prefer to fight offline, well, its boring, the AI hates fighting.

If you always wanted a pillow fight game, this is for you, you can punch someone 18943 times and they wont get cut. BUT your player after 5 punches will punch in slow motion. I have never seen that in a real life fight. Surely they can think of something different than slow motion?

I was hoping this would be the boxing game fix I needed, but in its current state, its boring as hell

I hope the devs can sort it out.

The game is fun however it is sometimes buggy for me but it is an early access so it doesn't ruin it to much for me. The commentators do get very repetitive fast, the devs should get some better commentary in the game and more accurate commentary for specific fighters. The judges suck that is one thing I hate. I could be piecing some dude up and he's throwing mostly missed punches and I'll still lose the round, I don't understand it. They should allow online fighters to vote for a location to fight, I know I said the commentators get repetitive but 12 rounds in the silent gyms feels dull sometimes.

A few of my only critiques is that it feels like a lot of the fighters fight the exact same. I'm hoping eventually fighters will feel a bit more unique. Also, some of the impacts don't feel great, it feels very pillow fighty sometimes. Also, PLEASE add replay/highlights for knockdowns and what not, and more knockdown animations/get up animations. 

I'm really hoping we get Mike Tyson, Hitman Hearns, and Jack Dempsey with their signature moves (flicker jab, dempsey roll, etc).  
PRAYING we can equip others signature moves/styles to our custom characters, or create our own. Not sure if that's possible, but it would be really cool to create specific hand positions, rhythms, punch combinations etc.

One major complaint i see about the game is the lack of power in the punches.. While i do agree at times it does feel soft, something tells me the developers intentionally made it that way. In a boxing match one main concern is stamina which leads to fighters throwing soft punches to focus on volume of punches and conserve stamina rather than power.. however i do believe the power punch system needs an update. the power punches feel slow and clunky... A second complaint ive seen around is one about feeling like you are in quick sand when you get close to the opponent. Once again im pretty sure that was put there intentionally because you are entering the ""pocket""of your opponent meaning youve dedicated to panting and punching without backing down, hence the limited movement to back out.....

pros:
really nice flow with combat (feels realistic)
combos do more than spamming do to stamina use which punishes lame playstyles
nice boxer selection
active community
can run on pretty old graphics cards (mine is a gtx970 dino)
cons: 
multiplayer isn't as bad as people make it sound; however, i have had the occasional issues but most of the invisible gameplay things ive seen on reddit are almost non existent at this point
ironically the selection of boxers is also a con because there are very obvious better boxers so even though there are a lot, they all suck besides like 4 max in each class

side thoughts:
no career and creation for characters YET....... However; it does have the icons in the game and they talk about it on discord all the time, so its hopefully around the corner.

The combat is still a bit janky and this game is a beast against your GPU. You're gonna need a really powerful GPU to play this with good graphics, and they do deliver some good graphics.

The game is still in development, and the combat is still not there - it is very close, though - but it is still very fun.
I see some real potential for a very good, if not one of the best (and only) boxing games on PC, specially if they deliver a good character creation and career mode. In that case, i can already see myself spending 50 hours on this game just playing my own character and testing builds.

There isn't much else to talk about, though. Some narrative dialogues could receive more, and better, lines. Improve performance a bit, make a training mode so you can test combos and get used to the controls. Support for local multiplayer (I tried and it didn't work for me, so i dunno if it's bugged or not implemented yet).

I seriously am passionate about this game, and want it to be the very best it can, but please, punches have to be tracking the head of the opponent, not be set to some kind of range mechanic. That is dum and unintuitive. Boxers move around when punching, I dont want to have to sit still five seconds for my boxer to realise what he is about to hit and try and HIT IT INSTEAD OF PUNCHING BEHIND THE OTHER BOXER.

From punch-out to Victorious boxers and HBO boxing on PS; and when I first heard about this new boxing game, I was excited. When I initially played the game it was fun and I really enjoyed it. I would have to say that it played better than Fight Nite Champions. The boxing in this game was realistic in the way the fighters threw punches and used their footwork, and the fight flowed nicely. But after all the gameplay updates, the boxers fight more robotic and feel sluggish that it is no longer fun to play. Fighters getting winded after throwing a three punch combo in the first round. I hate to say this, but it now plays like Fight Nite Champions, which is BORING, boxers either throw a punch or block and never mix it up anymore. To save this game, the developers need to bring back the original gameplay from launch. Even with the glitches it was FUN to play, and I looked forward to playing it; now, not so much. The developers also need to roll out this career mode soon, instead of chasing it's own tail constantly trying to tweak the gameplay, before this game gets forgotten about, which would be a sad thing because this game has true potential to be the best boxing videogame ever created. For now I can't recommend this game in the current state that it is in. This is to the developers, BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL GAMEPLAY FROM THE INITIAL LAUNCH.

The graphics and some features which FNC didn't have were nice but that's where the positives end. The AI's can take coma levels of punishment before they finally get dropped while you can take maybe 3 punches before you get dazed. The One Punch KOs should just be removed. I know it happens in boxing but it's an incredibly rare event where a fighter (not even known for hitting hard) puts out another in one single shot. I've had fights where I'm winning on the cards and have dropped the AI numerous times but nope all it takes is one shot and I'm out cold not even a knockdown just stopped completely. The amount of times this happens is absurdly high which boggles my mind. The fighters stats are as stupid as I've ever seen. Joe Louis is only as strong as Tyson Fury? The Brown Bomber who was renowned for having heavy hands only hits as hard as the guy who couldn't knock out glass chinned Wladimir Klitschko?? Muhammad Ali is barely faster than Tyson Fury and is equal in strength? The same Muhammad Ali who knocked out Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Cleveland Williams and many others? No Mike Tyson added yet he's boxings most iconic figure alongside Ali but I can excuse that. Floyd Patterson is not as fast as Tyson Fury? The same Floyd Patterson who is recorded as the second fastest heavyweight in history only coming behind Muhammad Ali? Don't even get me started on the Online gameplay. The lag and differences when you look at the two players against each others screens is like a whole different game. You can land every shot on your screen but not one landed on the other persons so it doesn't count or none of the shots landed on you on your screen but suddenly you've been dazed and dropped. This leads to confusing and stupid fights which don't make the slightest amount of sense. And oh my the body uppercut spammers are all over the place using Tyson Fury (who needs a huuuge nerf) are just ruining the game. The Judges are arguably the worst I've ever seen. You can outland your opponent and rock and daze them multiple times in the round but if you haven't outclassed them in this one unknown factor then nope you lose the round. At least when EA made boxing games they weren't complete shit like this one. Do not recommend to anyone who likes the sport or even playing games with how horrendously broken this game is or at least wait until the game is finished before buying it because as it is right now you're just buying a buggy, broken and awful game which can't even match a 12 year old game. Buy FNC instead if you want a good boxing game.

UPDATE: They improved the spam body uppercuts so they aren't as problematic yet Fury is still stupidly overpowered. I slug out with Fury dropping him twice using Wilder yet he can take me out with one punch. I drop Fury 3 times with Bruno in the prize fight and have him all over the place yet one punch and suddenly I'm out cold? Fury is stupidly overpowered in this game and that's gonna be the death of it, especially online. Nerf Fury because it's borderline impossible to win an online fight using anyone other than Fury. Still crap game buy FNC instead.

UPDATE 2: 02/06/2023 (I'm British) It's been about a week and a half and shocker it's gotten 10x worse. I hadn't tried out the women boxers until they decided to put them in the prize fights and oh man do I regret ever playing as them. This game does women's boxing no justice at all with the most notable part being Terri Harper suddenly hitting like Mike Tyson, defending like she's Floyd Mayweather and having a better chin than Ali? Now Katie Taylor hits like a pillow and has a glass chin which makes absolutely no sense. Terri Harper who got stopped by Baumgardner is suddenly blessed with a better chin than Taylor who not once in her 23 fights has been stopped only beaten once by decision. The new AI is pretty much as shit as it gets. Every fighter regardless of style will run around the ring with very few (e.g Fury) actually engaging in the fight and not running and blocking the full 3 minutes with maybe a 1-2 every 1 minute 30 seconds. You also bring in the most impossible achievement in history. KO any AI on Pro or greater difficulty in less than a minute. Right so I bring in Eddie Hall and Deontay Wilder. Hall goes down 5 times and gets up 5 times only to stay down on his 6th. Eddie Hall a man who's only fought one fight is suddenly able to casually do a better job of taking Wilder's best shots than Fury? This game is a complete joke. Can't forget it takes about 2 minutes to knock him down 6 times because every single knockdown is a full 20 seconds knocked off meaning to get the achievement you'd need the incredibly rare (unless you're AI Tyson Fury) one punch KO. By the time I put Hall on his ass 3 times it'd been a full minute because apparently Eddie Hall takes 5 seconds to get up and 15 seconds to fall down. In no world is this worth £25. I only bought it when it was on sale because no way in hell am I gonna pay £25 for a game that thinks Floyd Patterson a guy who typically came in under 200lbs (and was the only man some considered as fast as Muhammad Ali) is not as fast as Tyson Fury a man who comes in the 240s when he's slimming down. Once again buy FNC instead.

UPDATE: 07/06/23 Oh my can it get any worse? (It probably can and will) Now people abuse Usyk for body uppercut spam every single time. Now Usyk has the chin of Ali and Wilder's power is more pathetic than a 9 year olds? I don't understand how someone can eat 300 power straight rights from Deontay Wilder while using Usyk and only get dazed once while Wilder is dazed by some pissy body uppercuts and a few hooks. I decided to test it out to the fullest in a hook exchange and shockingly Wilder got dazed while Usyk was fine?? So Usyk hits like Mike Tyson and Deontay Wilder has the punch of a ghost because it never leaves a mark. Honestly you may as well shutdown this shitty game and refund everyone who bought it because this is the biggest pile of bullshit I've ever played. For fuck sake just watch Usyk vs Chisora and Usyk vs Joshua I and II while watching Wilder's last fight and tell me how the fuck Usyk is eating straight right after straight right when Joshua almost killed him with a body shot in the 2nd fight. Absolute fucking pisstake. Fix your awful game you absolute retards. Well this is just shitty brown at this point. They suddenly turned the tables and now you're Ryan Rhodes fighting Nigel Benn in the prizefights and oh man what a shitty job they've done. So apparently Ryan Rhodes a seasoned pro can't last 3 rounds without gassing out even though he's had a grand total of 52 fights. His chin is now glass and his face cuts like butter. His power is non-existent and butterbean punches 10x faster than him. This is disrespectful and proof this game knows less about boxing than a 6 year old watching Mike Tyson highlights. Can't believe they disrespect pro fighters to this extent. Horrible game buy FNC instead.

UPDATE 23/06/23 This shit just got 10x worse. Now Floyd Patterson is suddenly hitting 10x faster than before and can produce power that equals that of Deontay Wilders. I used Marciano online and faced a Patterson who somehow had more power than me and was far more durable. I nailed the Patterson about 200-300 times and he would simply eat the shots with little effort. I got hit 3 times and suddenly I'm dazed for a full minute. I finally daze him and he's dazed for 4 seconds before fully recovered. I drop him 4 times and he can still outslug me? This is just poorly done shit. Patterson is the only undisputed heavyweight champion to get KOed in one round? Marciano is the only heavyweight champion to retire undefeated and has the highest heavyweight champion KO% in history? So explain how Patterson who has the worst chin can take shots off one of boxings hardest p4p punchers in history? Fix this shit you call a game jesus.

Where to begin... Idiots and spammers can get away with back stepping and throwing constant straight shots and no matter how matter shots on the same side of the head landed you can't seem to knock them down.. (Hit a dude 40 times w a left hook in one rd to not even get a rocked state??) they always pick the fast fighters and spam you with constant unrealistic boxing that anyone with any passion for actual boxing would just throw up over.. it makes trying to get good pointless when all the people at the top just spam body straight, body jab, body straight,body jab. literally no counter for it because they just spam it so fast.. even counters that should work for that punch wont.. like not for a round.. for 10 rd's till they either rock you or if you manage to survive you lose on the score cards.. how if i""m landing uppercuts, hooks and power jabs, body uppercuts (practically everything) and his body straights and jabs are enough to rock me.. thats how you know you suck at making a game... 

 HONESTLY you should just play fight night. (prob what I'll be doing). it's way better.. At least they got the rights to use a bunch of legendary fighters.. In this game the dev's haven't added any new fighters since launch and the rosters are very limited. The weight classes even have some of the same fighter in many different weight classes to fill up space when honestly everyone online is just using two or 3 fighters because they are broken. (a lot of fighters need to be made less useless where some fighters are so fast they are broken basically). I get some fighters are great but when you got morons out here using hacks and exploiting this shit it's only going to turn people off of the franchise as a whole and they as dev's don't seem to be addressing any of this shit.... no time of an actual release date or who else is going to be in the game.. let alone so many features are unacessible still. Here's a tip to the developers.. instead of dickriding youtubers and releasing your game unfinished and a mess.. wait.. DON""T RELEASE A SHIT GAME THAT'S NOT WORTH PAYING FOR..  

It will be a while before this actually gets any good..
 What a joke and waste of money.. period.. done wasting my time thinking there was going to be a decent boxing game by semi decent dev's. These idiots clearly only care about making money. I bet some of them used to work for Activision..

since playing another 200 hours I can easily say this game is one of the worst.. every match i have now since giving this review has either been a cheater creating multiple accounts or some idiot using hacks.. Don't get me started on all the connectivity issues when I know there's nothing wrong with my internet..

No path to greatness and honestly anyone who actually likes boxing would hate this game.. so trash better of playing ufc or fight night.. way more polished, finished and at least they have a way to combat cheaters.. this game is a straight joke when you play 5 fights and they all are glitchy so everyone just pretends they arnt quitting then gets knocked down only to quit and you don't get the actual ko.. dumpster fire of a game.

There are a lot of improvements to be made, but its fun at its current state. Some things I think should really be improved are the following: 

Graphics and animations: The graphics are good as is but there is an uncanny feeling about them, especially facial animation wise. Most fighters have the same animations, which makes them feel stripped of personality. They all have the same victory animation which looks like an amateur boxer won, not a professional fighter in a high stakes fight. Punch animations feel stiff and unnatural, boxers in this game tend to keep their head up high on the center line when punching. When throwing punches, there generally isn't much weight felt behind the punches due to stiffness and lack of loading up their punches especially on power shots. Anytime a fighter is loading up their punches in this game, its a power puncher such as Deontay Wilder throwing a haymaker. 

Movement: Movement is good and animations flow into each other but it feels a little floaty. Movement between heavy weights and lighter weight classes don't seem to feel different to me while playing. Also, there is a bit of sliding in the movement when moving side to side which feels very unnatural. 

Music: Please add more music. The same few tracks play which can get very tiring to listen to on repeat. 

Damage: Damage still needs tweaking but the team has done a great job at fixing issues. At its current state, the punch damage has more of an effect on your opponent than it used to but it still feels like you're punching a sponge at times. Power punches should have more of an effect on the opponent in later rounds even if they don't land flush. Normal punches and power punches don't seem to be very different at the moment. 

Defense: Currently bobbing, ducking, rolling, and weaving feel stiff. I feel the game should have some sort of combo system with evasive maneuvers. For example, right now you aren't able to smoothly roll under a punch and throw a hook to the body. It would be nice to input a combination of buttons to execute that in a fight when reading your opponent for a boost in damage. 

Camera: Please give more camera options. An over the shoulder type of camera would be cool to feel like you're in the fight and camera angles that simulate angles from real boxing broadcasts. 

TLDR - The game is heading in the right direction, but the most important changes that need to be made are fundamental changes. Boxers need to feel more grounded and attacks need to have more of an impact to promote smarter play and adaptability. Grounded and realistic movement alongside an emphasis on the kinetic chain would make this game feel better to play and more fun in the long term as well. Boxing is about hitting and not getting hit, and the gameplay should reflect how important that golden rule is. I can't wait to see where the game is headed, but I hope important changes are made at some point.",1686803055,1686803055,True,24,2,0.710457086563110352,0,True,False,True

This makes the skill gap big but rewarding to get better at the game and learn boxing techniques. You could throw power punches all fight but if not thrown effectively you could gas out and get knocked out easier but also get a KO in the first 10 seconds to a punch thrown without power but perfectly placed.  
              So in my opinion i think its a very realistic fighting game besides some features taken out like clinching or illegal punches in online but that could also be abused in online so overall really good. Its still not fully out yet but i hope they add a few features in order to increase the lifespan of the game, they have your opponents record shown before the fight which is cool to see but it would be cool to to see the results of past 5 fights or best achievements overall to hype up the fight and get a better sense at your opponents boxing style.

Symptoms of CTE, which occur in four stages, generally appear eight to ten years after an individual experiences repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries.[5]

First-stage symptoms are confusion, disorientation, dizziness, and headaches. Second-stage symptoms include memory loss, social instability, impulsive behavior, and poor judgment. Third and fourth stages include progressive dementia, movement disorders, hypomimia, speech impediments, sensory processing disorder, tremors, vertigo, deafness, depression and suicidality.[6]",1686668139,1686668139,True,2,0,0.498098880052566528,0,True,False,True

I look forward to updates and content. I can't wait for career mode to be finished. I don't play online much because with some of the bug and glitches and such, online fights can be more frustrating than fun. Even  AI fights can be frustrating right now. However the game looks fantastic and runs great for me. There are a lot of people complaining, but as someone who buys a lot of early access games, these guys are doing far better than average.  If you want this game to be good, don't complain, provide feedback. Don't argue with each other, we all want the game to be awesome.  I think it is headed in the right direction and I don't think the devs are going to let this game drop off like some do. What I find impressive is I can actually form my own style as the movement provides plenty of options and freedom from footwork to leaning and ducking, aiming punches. At the same time I think this is part of the problem for some people, to be good at this game is hard, there is a lot to learn and get good at. If you don't know much about boxing it's going to be an even steeper learning curve. It's not just punching and blocking. The fundamentals are there, just needs tweaking and other features completed. Like to see Mike Tyson on there though, but EA might own his game rights. If this game were made by EA, it would already be in stores and on every system, as is and it would be $60. Keep that in mind. A lot of people like to compare this early access PC game to the multi-title, multi-system, fight night series by EA.

Good:
- Seemingly good boxing technique
- really good graphics

Bad:
-Much harder than should be to do visible damage to other fighters
-Terrible matchmaking
-Dsync in every match
-Limited fighters 
-Rage quitters ruin the game 

There are more negative factors to consider but since the game is in beta ill just scratch the surface. All in all, if you enjoy fighting games for the never ending chasing of your opponent, The easy to spam with small consequence, Awful ranked system and over all miserable experience of getting booted from matches due to bad connection then this game is for you. Id suggest leaving the game on the store until the full game comes out or you can get it at a massive discount. The game in its current state is in a hardly playable spot due to reasons stated above.

It takes a bit of time and effort to be able to pull some combos, but that's what boxing is about. Time and effort.
The only downside is that combats might look a bit sluggish from time to time, but I guess it's a matter of not having the correct boxing style that matches the character you're playing.

ABER ! ! ! 

Die spammer versauen das ganze spiel im online Modus.. sowas sollte einfach gebannt werden das ist kein Boxen und auch kein Tekken.
Dauerhaft kloppen die Kevins auf ihre einzigen Controller tasten X und B und freuen sich dabei immer sehr... Mama und Papa sind stolz auf ihre kleinen Krebskindern. 


Cheater und die hitbox im Online Modus machen es unmöglich im Ranked zu spielen oder auch nur eine schnelle runde.
Das Problem hier ist das es kein Anti Cheat gibt.. allein über Wemod Gab es 5k+ Downloads.
Viel zu Viele Cheater und die punkte Verteilung ist ein absoluter Joke.. du kannst dein Gegner 2 mal KO schlagen und der Gegner führt trotzdem meist mit 5 punkten mehr du hast einfach garkeine Chance das aufzuholen egal wie sauber oder Dreckig man spielt es macht auch kein sinn dann weiter zu Boxen wenn man von Anfang an schon Verloren hat und selber nicht knocked geht.
Schlimmer als Fifa.. online nur ruckler und dauerhaft Schlcehte Verbindungen zum Server.
Das macht so einfach kein spaß mehr und werde den mist online so lange nicht anfassen bis es ein fking anti Cheat gibt und anständige Server.


Die Wöchentlichen Price Fights sind ganz nett aber hier sollte man mehr Belohnungen später Hinzufügen dann würde das ganze auch mehr sinn machen.

Ja ich habe Fight Night gespielt .. Dennoch finde ich das Undisputed das Beste Box Spiel werden kann.

- Gute Grafik
- Gute Animationen
- Beinarbeit ist On Point
- Realistische Gescannte Fighter und Tattoos.

Die Entwickler Arbeiten hart und haben viel Geld für dieses Spiel hingeblättert um uns endlich ein Modernes Boxing Game zu Geben. 
Es gibt noch so viel zu tun im Online und Offline Modus das ist klar aber wenigstens Können wir es Schon mal im EA Spielen und müssen nicht weitere 5 - 10 Jahre warten.

! ! ! ! 

Für Single Player ist das Spiel gut also warte ich lieber auf den Karriere Modus.
Ich warte lieber auf den Karrieren Modus als mir weiter online einen Hoden platzen zu lassen weil die kleinen Kevins alle nur ein Knopf drücken können mir ihren 2 fingern pro Hand.

I have over 40 hours played in the game and have been testing it and re evaluating the game play after every update, I have played over 50 quick matches and am 12-3 in ranked play last time I played ranked was against players in the highest ranked class so my experience varies from casual matches to very competitive fights against some of the highest skilled players the game has to offer, i will make a list of Pros and Cons and will make draw comparisons in game play to Fight night champion as it is the best reference point.

Pros: the footwork in this game is easily when of its strongest features as it completely laps what FNC has to offer most fighters have unique footwork animations and it feels smooth it adds depth to the game play
- Directional punching is also a nice touch that adds a bit to the mix and can make matches play for realistic.
-Graphics, to me the graphics on max settings look very nice and the character models look good the Venues also look up to par.

Cons
- Overall game play, the over all game play to me is stiff one dimensional and clunky after a short while the game becomes very boring as the defensive systems are nearly broken and incredibly underwhelming
-Punching, Ironically the actual punching in this game i find to be very hit or miss there are certain fighters who actually appear to punch in slow motion there are many punching animations that certain fighters have that look terrible, for instance Josh Taylor currently one of the highest ranked fighters in the sport punches like a grandpa there is no snap what so ever to any of his punches and with in seconds of picking certain characters you immediately realize something is terribly off with the game play and the core of the game.
-Head movement, After quite some time with the game it became apparent to me that there is no amount of skill you can acquire to utilize smooth defensive maneuvers in a game light FNC you can slip multiple punches to set up a counter, you can bait your opponent with slips to set up a counter shot in this game it is just not possible you are faces with the weave mechanic that has an awful range of motion and at best will allow you to slip one single punch at a time a MASSIVE problem this game has faced is people complain that spamming punches is unfair these devs have curiously made all kinds of different updates to negate this all the while glazing over the fact the issue stems for the completely broken head movement system ultimately this game feels like a glorified rock em sock em robots and is not rewarding to play fights feel one dimensional.
-Slip mechanic, Seriously not much need to be said about this sure you will get... i guess you could say lucky ""slipping"" a punch here and there but very quickly you will realize the slip mechanic is broken and pointless to use.

Overall i would stay away from this game as i feel you will surely be let down at this moment the updates and the direction this game is headed is so far away from what really needs to be changed FIX THE HEAD MOVEMENT, MORE RANGE OF MOTION, DUE AWAY WITH SLIP MECHANIC OVERHAUL ENTIRE SYSTEM INTO ONE FUNCTION SUCH AS LEFT TRIGGER REWORK ANIMATION AND EMULATE WHAT FIGHT NIGH CHAMPION DID THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE STILL PLAY THAT GAME 10 YEARS LATER EVEN WITH ALL ITS FLAWS. i cant tell you how many friends i have who where HYPED about this game and came over to play cause i had it on PC while they only have consoles and with in one or two games where like ""yah....NO this is awful'",1675210594,1686007221,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 Having now played for quite awhile I can say this game will one day be a great boxing game.
 The latest updates have made boxing the cpu a joy but the online netcode  needs work. 
It can feel fine when you are playing, but if you are  talking to the person you are playing you will find out you don't always see the same things on the screen at the same time. Punches you think are landing are blocked or avoided, sometimes you will be hit with invisible punches. But it's still fun.
 People saying fight night is still way better, seem to know little about indy vs aaa studios and the vast amount of money aaa studios have .

- physics feel great but unpolished
- punches feel like they lack the feel of damage and power, almost feels robotic 
- AI still needs work, They tend to be super passive when they are up on the scorecards despite being on the hardest difficulty. the ai also does not feel human-like.
-Still no replays available 
-knockouts feel mundane and deliver no wow factor

Still great love the footwork mechanics. Head movement still needs work. I would like if the damage was a bit better some people take to many heavy shots and not be fazed in anyway. People try to walk you down while getting hit with everything plus heaving shots and big counters and eats them. I win by decision but there is no real consequence for taking so many hits it more like draining a health bar till they fall. wilder vs roy jones jr great example i can counter him land big shots but not fazed same if wilder lands dont feel like he didnt do much i have to pretend it was a damaging shot when in realty if he lands its very damaging and you hope you get back up. Sometime there is a flash knock out but rare and sometimes doesnt make sense but does happen in real life. Other than that fun game.,1685472622,1685472622,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Growing up I didn't know what a LAN chord was so playing fight night 2 on ps2 online wasn't really a thing for me. Even with the later fight night games I got them too late so their online communities were dead. With Undisputed, I get into a ranked online fight in 2 minutes. I think the longest I have waited for a game is 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Counter punching is very rewarding and hitting someone with a clean combo is as sick as it can get. My only note to developers is to increase damage a little bit. I feel like this is really realistic which is nice but its also a video game. I shouldn't have to fight someone 12 rounds every time we are close in skill level. I feel like aggressive fighters are punished. Even if they are landing 80 percent of their shots, if none of those are counters they wont be getting a knockout. They will most likely win the fight sure, but knockouts baby knockouts. Also in the future when this game full launches, surrenders in ranked should count as KO's or TKO's or something. It needs to be equivalent to throwing in the towel. Out of my 40 something ranked fights so far I've only gotten 5 knockouts and one was a random flash knockout (which was clutch tho I was losing in the 11th).

As for my thoughts on the AI in this game - since there isn't a career mode yet you can only do exhibitions - I think the AI is dumb and slow. I don't care how good I am, I should not be able to play Eddie Hall and knockout an Undisputed difficulty Ali in 4 rounds. If the developers work out an excellent difficulty system, then their career mode is gonna be awesome when it drops. As of right now though, I wouldn't even play career mode if it was currently available. That being said, I am not opposed to this game focusing a lot of its energy in the online modes. I am having a blast with it.

I recommend getting the game and supporting the development because its 30 dollars on steam right now. When this game fully launches on all the consoles I totally see this being worth 60. I may or may not be buying this game a 2nd time on my xbox when it comes out. That being said, if all you want is career mode then you have more waiting to do. I will say, the online ranking system is decent enough to find you a match with someone you actually have a chance of beating, that is, if you are impatient.",1685452770,1685452770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The good news? It's in Early Access so none of this was unexpected & will most likely be fixed. 

The game you buy today will not feel like the same game in 6 months. The patches are THAT significant to game-play.

Each patch seems to help with the ability to cheese/spam & new patches are out almost monthly. So far we have gotten 10 DLC fighters for free which is great to see. Our jobs as players are to find the cheapest and lamest ways to win so that developers can find ways to fix these. 

First, it was hook spamming, then it became body uppercuts.... & now?

 It's lead body hooks & nothing but combo spamming. Every exchange must be a 3-4 punch combo or you wont even do damage to your opponent no matter what shot you land or choose for twelve full rounds. Combos now add damage modifiers based on the volume thrown, so the only damage you can now inflict is in the later shots of a combo. 

You can jab & straight your opponent away for 7 rounds and just one combo from them will do more damage than you did in those 7 rounds combined. I wish this was a joke but it's not. Combos are now THAT effective. 

You cannot just beat somebody up by being a good boxer. As of right now you can throw 300 power punches IN A ROW in the exact same spot and you will not drop or daze your opponent. You now HAVE to throw random combos like RJJ.

It's unplayable at the higher skill level & feels like a version of Street Fighter you'd never want to play in your life. It's becoming very flow chart & stringy & if I want to play flowchart fighting games im going to play Tekken 8/Street Fighter 6.  Right now ppl are just waiting for you to fall into frame traps so they can throw combos & not even the ppl streaming this game can pretend it's fun. It's not. 

They need to bring targeting back. As of right now the game looks and feels like absolute garbage.",1675230187,1685264593,True,2,0,0.46835443377494812,0,True,False,True

I don't know why the hell Eddie Hall is in the game but his oponent Thor is not. Tyson is not there, Pacman is not there, they do have Mohammed Ali, Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury, Fraicher but hopefully in the future they will add Evander, Holyfield  and other key classic fighters such as Mike Tyson, Pacman and some more.
And since they already added Eddie Hall, why not bring in  Jake Paul, and maybe Tommy Fury and also the grandson of Mohammed Ali.

Anyways like i said in the start, it is fun for some hours but.. 
- there is no career mode yet
- you can only fight local or online fights  or 3 so called prized fights which is pre selected fighters
- they don't have that many fighters
- fighting is a bit onesided
-power punches are kinda waste
-cuts and swellings needs to be improved to award landing hits.
- the movement when you activate pace looks the same on all characters, they all look like Mohammed Ali
- same goes for the taunts, all fighters have the exact same taunts, no unique ones.
+ they have female fighters, Cecilia  Brækhus being one of them.
+  Its early development and it has potential.
+ The graphics is nice
+ movement looks good
+ the characters look really great.

give or take how patient you are with games that are in early development i would say that this game is playable at the moment if you have the money and want to try it out and join the journey of the development of the game.  But if you want a boxing game that got it all for PC, then save your money for now, wait a year or two then if the development has taken the right turns this game can be the ultimate boxing game that have ever been made for PC.",1685242938,1685242938,True,0,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,True

Extremely fun boxing game, good skill ceiling, it just looks and plays great. Good roster being built, keeps you excited for the next batch of fighters on the next patch.

The Bad:
Multiplayer is completely broken, you desync timelines with your opponent which leads to one of you getting phantom KO'd out of nowhere, not to mention that everyone cheats.

I am now changing this to reflect the complete and utter incompetence shown by the developers over the last 6 months. Instead of listening to the community and fixing the games issues, they seem intent on spending their time tweaking arbitrary fighter stats, introducing yet more boxers and constantly messing around with the damage system when the game is missing basic features like rematch options for private lobbies, a working clinch system in MP and stamina fixes to ensure the AI doesn't cheat. 

There is currently no story mode, no create a fighter, you can't bob, weave and move at the same time, you can't clinch online, there are constant disconnects and desyncs, the stamina system is flat-out broken, punches still get tangled up on the ropes, leaving you completely defenceless. There is no ""inside"" game to speak of and the HW's still move and throw like they're stuck in molasses.

I could write a fucking book if I was to list all the things this game does correctly or that I just love about the game. One of my favorite things though is the fact that any and everytime I've ever reached out to support, I've been responded to within 24hrs and I was responded to by an actual human lol but I have my gripes about the game, sure. Most of them have to do with other players using exploits that shouldn't be even possible to do and constantly do them the entire fight to win the fight. The only other gripe I have about this game is the lack of updates. I feel like we should be getting them twice as fast. Especially when each update adds 3 new fighters, a few arenas to fight in, and just a few gameplay tweaks. I feel like we should be getting twice the content if we're gonna have to wait a month or so for each update and a few tweaks to gameplay. Yet, there still is no anti-cheat (which I rarely encounter cheaters anymore), we STILL CANNOT switch stances while playing online, we still DO NOT have create a fighter OR career modes either. I understand the last taking much more time but still. Also, its not just 3 new fighters a month, it's 3 new fighters a month that people only care about 1 or 2 of. Like, wheres Tyson? Foreman? Holyfield? Eubanks? Zab Judah? Manny Pac? I understand they'll prolly never get Floyd, but that would be superdope if they could. Tank Davis? Haney? Shakur Stevenson? Oscar Valdez? De La Hoya? There are ALOT of very very good fighters that I'm sure most of us would love to already have in the game but yet, we get Amir Kahn who is ridiculously broken. I could go on and on and the boxers I feel like should be already added or that I'd like to have in the game over mst of the additions other than Loma. But those are my 2 biggest gripes...bad players hiding behing exploits that shouldnt even be there or they run backwards and barely throw punches on that a 1,2 combo twice a round and the time between updates and the content in the updates.

Since release, patching and bug fixes have been consistently released which has made this game significantly more playable.

---------------------------------------------

04/02/2023

There's not alot of good I can say about this game other than the graphics are okay. 

- Most of the game is just an AI body counter simulator
- Graphics are blurry?
- The match doesn't even load with some fighters and just gets stock in a load loop
- Punches just feel like sparring taps
- Power punches are the slowest thing on earth
- The demo videos for this are not accurate on how fights play out
- No KO replay?
- Each round ending has almost the exact same commentary no matter the result
- The didn't add Floyd Maywather but they added Eddie Hall?

I understand it's in early access, but i i'd suggest saving your money until it gets better. I'm bored senseless after 3 hours",1675429227,1684997346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 - Graphics are great
 - Game play feels good and is very reminiscent of the old Fight Night Games
 - Fighter Models look amazing (better than any EA or 2K game) and have custom animations and styles for each fighter
 - Promises a Custom Fighter Creator and Career Mode
Cons:
 - Currently, only quick fight and online play modes available
 - Missing some key fighters (eg. Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Anthony Joshua, Andy Ruiz Jr., etc.)
 - Sometimes fighter have a ""rag doll"" feel to them and don't fall / move naturally because of this.
 - There has been an abundance of cheaters online, however, the devs are trying to crack down on this.

Overall this game is absolutely worth the purchase, especially if you are willing to wait for Career Mode and Fighter Creation. The Devs seem very active and engaged with the community. If all modes were available, I would easily rank this game far and away better than anything EA or 2K have put out in the past decade.


Wishlist:
 - More Fighters (Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Anthony Joshua, Andy Ruiz Jr., Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather Jr., etc.)
 - More detailed Facial damage cuts etc.
 - Career Mode, and Customer Fighter Creation
 - Would also love to see inside of Career Mode, the ability to hire trainers and get perks depending on the trainer you pick

Игра находится в [u]раннем доступе[/u], но уже сейчас в игре есть, чем заняться. Есть не очень большой, но неплохой для раннего доступа ростер боксёров и разработчики обещают в течении раннего доступа довести ростер  до 50 имён. Техника боксирования в игре тоже реализована. Хуки, свинги, апперкоты, прямые удары, уклонения, клинч - всё есть.  Боксёры в игре реальные, мирового класса. Например, уже на данный момент в игре есть такие имена, как Мухаммед Али ( он же, Кассиус Клей) , Василий Ломаченко, Рокки Марчиано. На данный момент, в игре есть режим быстрого боя, то есть, игрок выбирает боксёра, которым хочет играть, потом определяет, будет ли его соперником реальный игрок или компьютер (да, в игре реализована игра на одном компьютере), выбирает арену и в бой. Далее, есть режим боя по сети. Но, тут всё просто, выбираешь боксёра, далее идёт поиск соперника . Всё, как обычно. Также, есть короткий режим тренировки, где игра покажет все технические нюансы боксирования.
Позже, ожидается и режим карьеры.  
Что касается оптимизации. Игра вполне уверенно идёт даже на средних машинах ( без учёта стриминга или записи игрового видео). Однако, игра не поддерживает клавиатуру и мышь, играть возможно только с геймпадом.

Unless you like to run away the whole match and call it ""boxing"". There's no way to close distance or cut off the ring effectively. The animations lock you into place so if someone just circles and runs constantly you will never catch them. Even if you jab straight or try to explode forward to cover distance you will not be able to get into a comfortable fighting distance.

I would wait on the game for future improvements. There are cool things you can do in the game. Directional punches are nice and once you master some things and learn the animations you can control distance and unleash combos on your opponents. There are other things to master like movement and sidesteps that feel nice at times.

Despite some positives, the game doesn't feel rewarding whatsoever. I consistently can out strike my opponents and hit them 500 times with little to no effect. 100+ power shots seemingly do nothing. The game rewards plodding forward and eating shots while spamming hooks or other quick punches/combos and trying to land a lucky power shot. Counter shots do no damage, sidesteps into a combo, nothing, sitting down on a combo and picking my opponent apart does nothing. Perfectly timed movement and check hook while dodging a short right hook, you guessed it, it does nothing. Timing my opponent and reading them should feel rewarding and do something. Damage and stamina were addressed at points in the beta, but are extremely bad in the game right now. 

Like most, I was extremely excited for a new and realistic boxing game. After around 200 rounds played, I can't see myself playing the game all that much. I might login and play a game here and there, but it's not something I am dying to play. I would like to hope major balancing changes happen, but with the game as it is after seemingly being corrected throughout the second beta with changes to damage and stamina, I don't know if there will be. Certain animations in the game are completely useless because they feel clunky and inconsistent. The forward moving and standing straight (cross) is pretty much useless in the game because it's clunky, awkward and slow combined with doing very little damage and only stuns my opponent for a millisecond after connecting. This rewards hook and other spam punches even more. 

Other than that, the game does feel a bit robotic. I think it's because of most of the animations being the same or very very similar and not all that fluid. Some of them are really nice, but most are not. There was a ton of talk about true to form fighting and animations, but outside a few fighters stances and certain fighters like Roy Jones most of the punches are the same from fighter to fighter. Every fighter has the same useless cross and most of them have the same animations for hooks, power hooks, and hooks to the body as well. If you were excited about fighters feeling very different and there being fluidity and differences between all their punches, I would temper your expectations. I don't think the devs can do that much about this, but it was marketed early on about being true to fighters with how they motion capture punches and stuff. Everyone having similar animations also contributes to the game feeling more robotic.

The game has potential, but it's a long way from what has been marketed and a long way from a full product.DO NOT buy a cpu just for the game it is not worth it. Once the hype for a new boxing game dies down, the true worth of the game to most will come out so people should wait for right now. For me, after the hype of wanting to play, people should wait for improvements before buying.

Do not get tricked by positive reviews at least 1/4 of the positive reviews are actually negative and from people who did not know to change the thumbs up to thumbs down. Do more research before buying, streams videos, etc. Do that and make a decision for yourself.

At the moment this game is unbearable. It's easy to win, but it's pretty much impossible to have a fun game. Every game is against whatever boxer has the silliest most spammy punches. 

The damage system in this game is completely flawed and broken. There is hard health for your boxer as a whole and temporary health for areas such as the right side of your head, right side of body, etc,etc. What ends up happening at the end of every round is that the temporary bars are completely recovered according to overall health. Overall health is the only thing that can decrease the amount of temporary health specific areas have. If you hit someone in the head 600 times, which I have without any effect, his body health will basically heal his brain damage. There are core problems with this game. Ping, damage system, animations, etc, etc. Even if this is early access I would recommend others to wait to purchase this for at least a month or two.",1675286430,1684794820,False,5,0,0.543049752712249756,0,True,False,True

It got much better now.

Broken ai. You can feel the scripts go on just like in fifa. The opponent does counter attacks streaks like every minute, you can't do anything but wait, because he'll counter with 'crit' every punch you throw. Throwing right hook almost always goes behind the head. You can't even change the keys binding, you can only change preset. For some reason after 1 day I can't block body shots, holdint body modifier and block keys just doesn't work. Performance is pretty bad, 4090, 1440p maxed out gives 55-70 fps in arena with the crowd.

The presentation needs a lot of work as well as the breaks at the end of the round , like we need to see our trainer patching us up and giving prep talks.

The graphics look very good as been on the unreal engine it should do.

They do have a lot of real boxers from current ones to legends like Muhammad Ali and Frank Bruno for examples.

Also got the gypsy king and a lot of modern-day boxes.

There is an online mode but I wouldn't even bother with it as there's a lot of cheats and I prefer offline anyhow

Overall I would say get this on a
special or wait longer until it's been more refined and more content has been added.

As for boxing games goes this is the best one out there for PC and feels like given time it can be extremely good also for PC we really don't have many boxing /UFC games out there but this is a very proming start.

First, you should be able to choose which side of the camera you want your fighter.  When you're 2nd player controls feels wrong or IDK but the other one has an advantage for sure just because you usually practice on that side.

In my most recent match with Canelo, I landed 150 body shots, many of them hooks (his specialty) and my opponent still had 68% stamina left after 12 rounds to my 75%. 

The damage output is like if you were using pillows instead of boxing gloves. I've also lost due to cuts even though I was massively out boxing. Why do I need to watch 4 or 5 screens before the match? Why do I need to watch the whole pity party after a match before the results screen? Why can't both fighters be on the screen during the end of the round so that you can see who's cut? Why does it have to be real time in between rounds? Just skip that so these ADHD kids can't spend the whole time looking at thots on instagram...

There are so many little things that this game needs to improve before I can recommend it. Most importantly, when I land my 6th power straight in a row with Wilder, I should be rewarded for it.

The mechanics are sound. The fighters stats make sense. The graphics are phenomenal for early access, and are that of a complete game. Be ready for some drawn out fights.

Despite being over a decade old, Fight Night Champion is still the best boxing game to date. It strikes a perfect balance between fun, challenge and realism. It has a few issues here and there but you'd have a fun time for 9/10 matches. Undisputed, probably 5/10 matches. Even the UFC series has better boxing than this game, which is shocking. 
So here's the 3 main issues:

1. It's actual core gameplay needs work. Seriously. The issue with these games is this game tries to have crisp, lifelike animations AND reactive and satisfying gameplay. Sadly, it falls short in the gameplay department. Because the animations are so well done they're not dynamic ('arcadey') enough for an actual fighting game. It results in hit detection issues, unreasonable misses, frustrating input delay and just some very strange movements sometimes. So many times has my character thrown punches out halfway and then retracted them for no reason, or randomly slows his punches down, or just does all round freaky witch still with his hands. Some other reviewers have also described the movement as feeling like you're ""swimming"" or ""punching in a dream"". It really can be like this sometimes. 
People might say skill issue, bad at movement, that's just realistic etc etc. Yes, partly true, but I've never ran into these issues in any other modern boxing/UFC fighting game. Here's a worked example: Crawford v Hatton challange. Despite having a 10-inch reach advantage, Crawford's jab will still get beaten to the punch by Hatton's powered up bodyshot - from a STANDING position. You could argue it's realistic (big hatton fan here), but it's just kinda ridiculous in gameplay, and it means the only way to win is to cheese, which I did. How a man can extend his arms 10inches like mr fantastic is beyond me!

2. Its underdeveloped, even for early access. This isn't the main criticism, but you should know where the state of the game is at this review. With its current issues, I wouldn't even try PVP/competitive play, and I haven't. What about PVE/Offline matches? There are a reasonable roster of fighters and maps which all look fantastic, but the only gamemodes are daily challenge modes which increase in difficulty, and the quickplay (classic pick fighter and fight). No career mode yet. No offline stats or rewards, no goals to work towards. This means it relies entirely on having good, fun, replayable gameplay, which of course, it does not.

3. Stability issues. Expect crashes, sound issues and of course the gameplay issues. When I first got the game, I had no issues. A few months and updates later, sometimes the game crashes on loading into a match and sometimes in a match. Sometimes FPS drops hard. The sounds are a bit weird too. Sometimes there'll be periods of silence when the match ends, and both fighters will just kinda stand there, cheering to themselves awkwardly lmao. My PC should be able run this on high graphics easy, but even running them on minimum settings still results in fps drops at the same moments & crashes. You might get lucky and experience none of this, or you could be the same as me and get them on some updates and not on others.

""But it's early access!"" Yeah. It is. But the issues are part of the core game. I seriously doubt any amount of tweaking is going to fix the awkward gameplay grappling with its own identity. The details, movements and character of the real boxers portrayed are so well done, they're done better than any other game! The real referees, cornermen, announcers and arenas look and sound fantastic. When they are actually reactive, the controls are good, with the scheme being familiar to most combat sport games. The soundtrack is decent. But to actually play it you realise its just a hollow imitation of better games. 
This was so promising and I can tell the devs busted their ass for some aspects of the game, and I'm no fan of EA Sports...but I can't recommend this. This shouldn't be paid for in its current state.

Positives
-Best looking combat sports game yet
-Good amount of venues already in early access 
-Deepest boxing game roster with both legends like Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray Robinson, and modern greats like Canelo Alvarez, Tyson Fury, Deontay Wilder, Terrence Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk, Vasily Lomachenko. (150 fighters confirmed on the game's website which will be gradually added into the game)
-Scanned and motion capped fighters with unique animations
-Developers being open in communicating plans for future updates and responding to community concerns (twitter + montly developer ""roundtable"" update videos on youtube
-Directional Punches (unique punch animations which vary based on direction you're moving, these can be improved however)
-Fighter Traits (passive traits that affect how your fighter performs, some are also unique to that fighter only)

Negatives
-Damage feels a bit low, over the course of beta invites and since early access got released they have tweaked damage many times, perhaps add in a vulnerability system similar to UFC 4 to make shots more effective when you counter your opponent. Game feels like rock em sock em robots at points
-Clunky gameplay, probably my biggest issue with the game right now, there's delays between actions, for example if you slip then throw a punch you can feel the delay between the animations rather than it feeling as 1 smooth action
-Controls are strange, clicking your left stick in a direction to slip isn't the most user friendly, (just let us flick the stick in a direction please)
-Multiplayer infested with Cheaters/Hackers
-Spammers/Cheesers, stepback straight is abusable and highly effective, spamming hooks using fighters with extreme hand speed like Amir Khan.

Overall, this game has an extreme potential with the amount of fighters the devs have and plan to release. At this current stage in early access, career mode isn't in the game and there isn't much news surrounding that regarding features but it is a priority.

The button layouts is something you’re gonna have to adjust to if you’ve been playing UFC for over 500,000 hours. Unless, the developers discuss about custom button layouts practice against a computer to find the right combos (if you can and I’ll get to that). Working on the head movements is key but it’s very much a challenge in this game because once you time your opponent and find out his/her rhythm you still get hit even when you know you’re out of the way at the right time. To compromise for the time being until that’s fixed creating distance Will do. Although you and your opponent will think that it’s “running away” but really head movement and slipping is still a risk until that can be fixed… COMBOS are not as sequenced as I thought it would be. Instead of a flowing type feeling like JabCrossHookCross (1232) it’s legit like JabCross_HookCross (12_32). Or JabJabCrossLeadupper (1125) its JabJab_Cross_Leadupper (11_25). It’s the little delays in the combos that WILL mess up your rhythm.
If the developers can work on custom button layouts, head movement, and punching sequence I would be even more satisfied….The game’s graphics and body mechanics is great and although the game is still new it will become even better. Can’t wait for career mode too.

Pros:
- Match pace is slow. It'll be better if the game could let you modify the pace of the game
- Some fighter have in accurate build, like Lomachenko in real life is high volume puncher, but if you try to simulate that style, the stamina will drain a lot
- The concept of directional punch (like pivot hook) is great, but the gameplay still couldn't optimized that concept well
- The footwork system concept is more realistic than Fight Night, but it's hard to use

Unfortunately the developers have instilled little faith with their reactive balancing approach. The cycle seems to be that the community will find a punch or combination that actually lands consistently despite how poor the hit detection is, form a meta around it, complain that its unrealistic, and the devs nerf it into unusability. The example here is that the first iteration of the meta was to only play as Ali and spam hooks with the same hand repeatedly. This resulted in some of the worst looking and even worse feeling boxing gameplay experiences ever. Now, if you throw the same punch twice, your fighter suddenly loses all motor function and swings like hes swimming through jello, on punch 2.

See, people prefer the path of least resistance. If you remove one path, the next path of least resistance will be used.

That next path was the outsized range on the body uppercuts. The next will be whatever still lands consistently after they nerf body uppercuts. Until the developers can figure out hit detection and more importantly the damage system the game is not worth the money spent. My best guess is that its all totally random at this point. Ive seen clean shoryuken power uppercuts perfectly timed and placed to take a mans head off absorbed like nothing, and runaway, back foot, feet unplanted, glove didnt even make contact soft jab rock someone.

The movement mechanics are quite clunky and not precise so you can really struggle to cut of the ring or move as effectively as you like.

The punching mechanic is also quite poor, you're given the ability to lean in and out to avoid punches but you can use't the same lean to pick angles from the shots, it all feels quite rigid. The directional punches are okay but they don't really give much fluid movement.

The damage system is the most broken thing in the game, they had  a system to damage certain sections of the head and body but players were just focusing on one spot for easy knock outs. They've since changed this to 2 damage zones that have way too much health, you can land 1000+ shots in a fight and still never rock or knock them out and this needs work for the game to even be playable. 

All in all if you really want to box on the pc its the best choice but it's yet to be seen if the devs can make something other than a rockem sockem robot feeling game atm

This game was NOT very good on release. It felt clunky, the impact on punches wasn't great, the jab felt like an afterthought. My biggest issue was that boxers would sometimes just walk past each other, brushing shoulders while punching air. I was really disappointed. I had been following the game since the first gameplay trailer back when it was Esports Boxing Club. The movement feels great and the graphics are really top notch. That's about all I had to say about it. I know, only 9 hours. But after the first 9 hours, I would not recommend this game. I wasn't looking for a copy of FNC/R4, but I was hoping that it would be comparable in challenge and fun.

I re-downloaded the game today after seeing Loma drop. Turns out the devs have made massive improvements to all of my grievances while improving on the things I enjoyed. All of my previous complaints have been addressed. Is it perfect? far from it. Is it fun? It's a blast. Is everything fixed? not even close. But the difference in feel from the last time I played this, just a few months ago, is night and day.

Prize fights are an awesome introduction, but two of the three for me this week did not load at all. I checked the scoreboards and only saw 0s for many people for them. I find these to be fun and unique challenges that I havent seen before, plus you get XP for these fights. 

I truly love the movement in the ring. I cannot stress this enough.

To start the game looks and plays really well, the movement system is very interesting and even after 40 hrs almost I still have a lot to learn about it but the abuse of the retreat counter is kinda crazy, I get countered while I'm planted and have my guard up often and maybe that's a bug but it's still annoying. The general damage and the other two damage scales don't really line up and the general health could be tweaked a bit or things like head and body damage should be tweaked. The lighter and faster heavyweights have an issue with repeating punches with little to no penalty and that basically attributes to all the legends across the whole roster. The ""rage quitting"" issue definitely needs to be addressed as well, 12 real time rounds is a long time to get dragged through just to have your opponent quit when there's 3 seconds left in the 12th.

Undisputed bills itself as the ultimate boxing experience, but in reality, it's little more than a series of repetitive button mashing exercises. Sure, there are different fighters to choose from and a variety of venues to fight in, but at its core, the gameplay is shallow and uninspired.

The graphics are decent enough, but the animations leave a lot to be desired. Punches don't feel like they have any weight behind them, and the fighters move in a way that's more robotic than human. It's hard to get invested in a fight when the action on-screen looks like it's being performed by mannequins.

The sound design is equally lackluster. The crowd noise is generic and the announcer's commentary is repetitive to the point of being annoying. And while the game does offer licensed music to listen to, it's hard to enjoy when you're focused on punching your opponent in the face.

But perhaps the biggest issue I had with Undisputed was the lack of strategy. In a real boxing match, there are multiple factors to consider, from your opponent's fighting style to your own stamina. But in this game, it's all about throwing as many punches as possible and hoping for the best. There's no sense of nuance or finesse, just mindless button mashing.

In conclusion, while Undisputed may scratch a certain kind of itch for boxing fans, it's not a game that I would recommend.

When this game first came out it had tons of potential and still does. Great graphics but gameplay wise it feels like everything good they had going for them they patch or update to appease the casuals. When the game first came out there was a significant Skill Gap and right now anybody can jump online for the first time and beat somebody who has a lot of experience. Being able to pull off satisfying Roy Jones style combos, tripling up on straights and hooks, has been hampered by arm fatigue and punch tracking. My main gripe is the new damage system which makes it near impossible to Rock your opponent and seemingly do no damage at all when you're beating the crap out of someone.....Seems everything that made the game great they are going in the opposite direction. I've supported and recommended the game all the way up until now. I would definitely NOT recommend the game in it's current state. Exploiting game mechanics means more than knowing how to box and there is little to no skill gap as of right now.....I still hope the company turns things around and hires much needed HELP because when the game was good I've had some of the best and most realistic moments I've ever had in gaming. But it seems like they are intentionally lessening the skill gap to make it accessible to folks who don't know anything about boxing. Without proper outside guidance and funding I'm starting to see this game as nothing more than a ""Starter Game""', at best. Hopefully the hype once surrounding this game will Inspire another company can pick up the slack and make a proper boxing game....I do give Steel City credit for trying and opening up the door though. I just don't see them getting unstuck from the mud at this point. Fighters that once felt individualistic and different now all kind of feel stuck In the same box. Range of motion is hampered and it's hard to land punches moving forward unless you walk in chest to chest.......But Still, it's better than nothing and shines in certain areas.",1675914002,1683576512,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Just recently got a split decision L where I knocked my opponent down 3 times. One judge scored 117-110 in my favor, other judges scored 114-113 in his favor. Theres no definitive win unless you knock someone out, meanwhile you can send someone into recovery mode 5 times in a row, and not get a single knock down. Ranked is absolutely awful, will win 10 matches straight, and be lucky if you get 10 rank up points. Game is absolutely swarmed with hackers, and people who quit as soon as they are losing. NO penalties for people who constantly quit the game. I could go on and on. Was such a fan of this game, and have tried effortlessly to be easy on my criticism, due to the fact that the game is only in alpha, but I cant handle it anymore. Seems like the game is moving backwards, not forward.

The icon for 360 pad start button for settings need to change, i didn't know what the button was


Also need more optimisation quite alot of fps dips

I just fought amir khan again and hes stamina went to full halfway threw the fight, h was like the terminator, also he had big cuts halfway threw the fight and they patched both of them up and then they just didnt get anymore damaged, most of my shots with canelo are missing aswell, were as amir khan lands nearly all of his shots, hes throwing shots all the time and not getting tired, i throw 3 or 4 and i'm out of stamina, you've also made the pictures for the boxers too small when your selecting a boxer you cant see who it is, canelo is a 90 and amir khan is a 85?, you do know canelo is rated number 5 pound for pound and i cant bang out amir ""Glass Jaw"" khan, canelo should be atleast a 92 or 93 maybe even 95

I just tried a fight with me usky against eddie hall, i got beat i couldn't get up, a mini game for getting up?, i think i might get a refund now, i do want to support you, but i dont think your gonna change the getting up mini game and i dont wanna be stuck with a game i paid £24.99 for and i'm not gonna play it, If you change it i'll keep it, but atm you've gotta concentrate on the red box, your indicator and pressing the triggers all at the same time to get up?, Concentrating on three things all at once?, You must be bloody mad, A puzzle in a boxing game, there should be some fun element for trying to get up, so you want to get up, how can you learn a puzzle that's always random in a game, how do you get better at that part of the game?, you're suppose to get skilled at this game, how do you get skilled at a random game?, This ain't Crystal Maze, (Kell Brook) what you wanna do a skill game?

My mates gonna ask me as well if i keep the game how to get up , My reply would be ""I don't know i've never done it""

I know you're trying to be you're own game, but you should of made it more like Fight Night Champion, like a pressure pad, i could get up 4 times usually on that game, who cares if you have a same mechanic as Fight Night Champion, it doesn't matter, If its fun to play then were all happy, imagine how many more people would play your game, all were really after i think is Fight Night Champion but tweaks and upgrades

Also the punches don't feel weighty enough not enough pop on the shots, they seem like there not doing anything, On Fight Night Champion you really felt like you was throwing bombs and power shots

Also why is the crowd so quiet on tale of the tape bit, there just about to come in.., there not excited?, There's not enough action and atmosphere of a boxing event, it all just seems a bit flat, except in ring commentary, but even thats abit dodgy, its like these guys recorded one line and moved onto the next one

Whats with the ring walks?, are they not gonna be coming out with the belt walking down the aisle, its all about creating the atmosphere, infact where are the belts?

You know you've gotta make the game better then Fight Night Champion cause this boxing game seems like our last hope..

I'm getting a refund for the meantime, i'll be back in the future

Also where the hell is tyson?, since i found out about this game ages ago it was tyson in the gameplay videos

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjrrNlnmL9o
Is this the same game?, its looks different

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Zert5VaWk
Put these guys in aswell, You could get Larry Merchant for some cut scenes in career, i'm sure he would chip in

Pros:

Graphics, compared to Fight Night the graphics are great especially the top boxers of today (older boxers can be hit or miss, which is understandable)

Game Play (Single Player):
I do not play online so cannot comment, but single player is very fun although sometimes too easy.

Cons:

Commentary:
Although a minor gripe commentary needs to be improved, too many of the same lines repeated.

Lack of Career Mode:
Can be forgiven due to early access but career mode is a must otherwise for people who do not play online it is very repetitive.

Entrances:
Very samey unfortunately , needs more unique entrances and songs

Lack of Customer Creation:

Once again understandable due to early access but Create A Boxer is very much needed.

I purchased it today, putting in a straight 3.9 hours instantly and like it, however there are a few flaws which need fixing. Being someone who grew up on the EA Fight Night games I enjoy it. It shows that developers have mimic'd the series in a way, but have their own flavor. The mechanics are ok, but they tend to slip from time to time. Sometimes punches go through my opponents or i'll get no reaction at all from shots that clearly land, not to mention the lag on and offline. I'm guessing the issue with lag are due to overseas hosting, but i could be wrong (I'm wired directly to my modem by the way). Id recommend this game to boxing fans due to this being the only decent boxing game out, but id also give a fair warning about the constant glitches. I'm not going badmouth the game too much due to it being in the early phases, but changes have to occur otherwise it will be thrown aside. 

Overall, I look forward to seeing what this becomes in the near future. If the developers take their time with this product it could be something great because i see potential already.

this game is fun forsure, but only if your opponent agrees to also play the game. if you run into the combination of loose footwork and jab backstep straight you will be in for 28 minutes of chasing every opponent which is far from enjoyable. cutting the ring off doesnt work because one can simply walk circles around you once close, all shots whiff, and the chase continues. 

the inside fighting addition really helped, like seriously helped. but the problem is jabs and straight punches feel like they have no recovery frames, just startup and instant active frames but no recovery, so there are no real punishes in the game. if this gets added, like EVERY mainstream (and otherwise) fighting title this game will quickly split the joystick spamming backsteppers from the real enthusiasts looking for quality gameplay. i say that with a ranked record of 59-6 atm which doesnt mean much but ive won hundreds of quick match fights with very few losses, ive seen it all. 

it would be sick if this game got better, theyre trying i guess, but it doesnt seem like theyre working to make the game better for both levels, it just seems more suitable for the ones who dont understand fighting games so much and i guess that makes sense because often i hear them talking about the ability to ""just pick it up and play"" and at this point those types of games push me away more than bring me in.

-Due point above body punchers/infighting is pointless
-going to the body is pointless
-clenching basically does work


Infighting in this game is non existent, power means nothing. the game is speed, loose foot work and run to win. physics look better than fightnight movements are more realistic but the gamelplay is clunky and               chopy, having boxed in real life for many years i can say this game is lacking where most boxing games lack and that is 'how do we allow outside fighting without promoting a hit and run meta'. 

For example playing a slugger style is a quick way to lose. body shots reduce stamina but not the speed at which your opponent will punch.. well not really enough to warrant going to the body as you just give away rounds, the head movement to avoid punches is super clunky, this was actually better in fight-night. champion. Power punching also seems rather pointless as a haymaker is soo animated and slow is almost a joke, again this promotes a tap tap run style which means tall fast fighters will mostly come out on top due to reach and speed. 

Moving on to punches, here again the game is lacking as you are forced to button bash as the stick punches come out slower and less accurate promoting a tap tap one two play style whee players float in and out of contact tapping each other with no meaningful exchanges as the aggressor is likely to lose on points so here we see jab straight and the occasional left hook depending on the reach of the fighter. 

These flaws also mean you are destined to be fighting the same fighter over and over in ALI v ALI situations where you are left with play the game the same as everyone else or lose. Extra dodge/slip function is cool but is very clunky to use based on the fact that players use that stick to move, it just again promotes clunky play as its awkward to pull of, it might actually be better to incorporate the head movement from FN  or sliping holding down the LT and doing the side step movement.

I would wait another year or longer before playing this game and having the expectation of a fun boxing experience for now it might be best to stick to FNC which is not a perfect game by any means and certainly has its fair share of issues but at least you can fight on the inside and currently have a better roster. I certainly hope they fix this before they bring Mike tyson on the roster as he will be utterly useless unless they fix in fighting and cutting off the ring.",1683063632,1683287744,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It's so nice to see new boxing games, but this, at its core, is a janky mess. This is the case especially during online play. Also what's up with the highest level of difficulty for the Prize Fights? It's fake difficulty cause the rival boxer does max damage just for touching you. Vulnerability system and general gameplay needs tweaking. It's not satisfying to knock people down and out. Everything feels light and like sockem bumpers. Still waiting on a new Fight Night experience. I'll just have to go back to Champion for now. I can't take this game seriously as of this time.

****UPDATED REVIEW****

I appreciate that the devs are changing up the game based on community feedback. That right there gets my thumbs up alone. Secondly, the fact that EA won't make another Fight Night created Undisputed. The issue I'm having at this time is that there are certain punches that have insane accuracy (backstep straight, uppercuts to the body etc...) than others. This forces me to only use those specific punches. Even when I am winning a fight and want to mix it up, I tend to lose the exchange even with proper setup w/jabs.

The first time I started the game it didn't load to the main menu until I restarted it twice, from there the game doesn't recommend you do the ""training"" that most games will often do, if you want to ""try"" and do that you go to the locals tab, where you are met with another collage of boxers praying the fucking thing will load. It doesn't, you restart and try again, and again, and again. 

I understand that its in early access and the there may be bugs, I can deal with that. What I cant deal with is spending $42 actual fucking dollars to find out its not a game, its a joke.

Those who are old enough to have played and loved that series will find a familiar control scheme, amazing graphics, and developers that appear to actually know how to implement a SIMULATION of the ""Sweet Science.""

I'm 44 years old and grew up with boxing, having boxed as a youth myself, and I would be happy with the game even if it never got a Career Mode, as the fights are fun even without those stakes, and the online mode is quite good.

These developers have been INTENSELY working to build upon and support their game, and honestly, I don't think I've found a better Early Access experience than what they provided... it is a working game that will be the foundation of an amazing game!

One of the game's major strengths is its graphics, which are stunningly lifelike. The detail in the fighters' faces and bodies, as well as the attention to detail in the arenas, make for a visually immersive experience.

However, there are several cons to this game that cannot be overlooked. The first is that the game feels incomplete - there are few options beyond a standard fight, and the pool of playable boxers is disappointingly small. Additionally, the lack of recognizable boxing legends is a missed opportunity to hype the game and add more depth to the roster.

The controls are another issue with Undisputed. They are merely adequate, and not particularly intuitive or satisfying to use. The techniques available to the player are also very limited, with little variation between different boxers. It would have been much better if each fighter had their own unique moveset, which is a feature that previous boxing games have done well.

Overall, while the graphics in Undisputed are impressive, they cannot make up for the game's shortcomings. With limited options and an unsatisfying control scheme, this game falls short of what could have been a great boxing game.

Overall damage in the game is very low and it's not feel dangerous to eat punches at all, beside that i feel like spamming is more rewarding than well timed and precise power punch, for example i played with Joe Frazier against Joe Frazier, and he spammed for 12 rounds not connected punches while my 30 left hook power shots did no damage at all to him and he wins at the end (which is the most dangerous punch of Joe Frazier). My advice is to increase the overall damage and power shots damage and make consequences for spammers with the stamina. I mean i box too and i can guarantee that no one can throw 200 puncher per round for 12 rounds, its not how it works, beside that well timed counter punch doesn't feel rewarding at all.

[b]Overview[/b]
While it's not perfect, it's still a lot of fun and easily the best boxing game out there right now. I even compared it to Fight Night 4 and 3 and found that it surpassed them in terms of gameplay.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game has a solid offline mode with quick fights, training, and local 2-player options. You can also play online in quick and ranked matches. The slip and weave mechanics are very satisfying and add depth to the gameplay. The animations are next level and it's very satisfying to land a liver shot and see the ripples on your opponent's torso.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics are very impressive and remind me of the first time I played Fight Night 3 on the Xbox 360. The ripples on the face after a slow-mo knockout are even better in this game. The range of arenas and licensed music are also impressive.

[b]Improvements Needed[/b]
There are some areas that need improvement, such as the lack of replay after a knockout and too many cutscenes before fights that need to be skipped. There are also some slight glitches in the animations, and after a knockdown, the lack of ragdoll physics means that you can hover on your knees at times. Creating a lobby can also be a hassle since you have to share a code every time.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Overall, this is a fantastic game for the price and I can see it becoming the new Fight Night. I'm excited to see the upcoming career mode and create-a-boxer features that will be added in the future. If you're a fan of boxing games, this one is definitely worth checking out.

From wishes - add David Haye, Oliver McCall and Danny Williams to heavyweight and James Toney to multiple weights.

You need to fix the visual ratio of boxers by height, not everyone looks proportional to their height (for example - Enzo Maccarinelli, Hopey Price, David Adeleye, Marciano in cruserweight)

Joe Luis  - from 88 to 90
Franc Bruno  - from 81 to 82
Deontay Wilder -  is very slow (in real life he is slow on his feet, the speed of punches is the highest, you did the opposite)

Unfortunately, Undisputed is not a boxing simulation, rather, its more of an arcade style rock' em, sock 'em type game—which some might enjoy. 

The range of movement is limited and angles are unable to be performed—which is essential for fighters like Lomachenko. The game has an overall feel of stickiness, which can be especially felt when attempting to avoid punches. The lack of freedom in movement causes the game to feel repetitive, as every punch sequence outputs the same. If they would add the ability to move while throwing punches then this would allow for unique combinations to be performed, resulting in a more dynamic experience. Although directional punches are available, they are limited and quickly become repetitive/predictable due to producing a repeated animation. 

The online mode is currently in a unplayable state due to desync issues, as one user may experience a knockdown and the other user may not.

The graphics are good, however, the models are fairly static when it comes to any damage—the same cut over the right or left eye only appearing. There is also a lack of blood appearing on clothing.

There are a laundry list of bugs and unfilled promises but it is not necessary to get into at the moment, as those may change in the future.

I can't see the overall game changing much leading to the full release, as the developers seem to be dedicated to the static style of gameplay. That being said, if you want an arcade style boxing game with some bugs then its a good purchase due to the big boxing names alone.",1682436512,1682452909,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

That is perhaps my main issue. I'm sure they will add replays, improve the commentary and add the fighter names at some point, as well add a plethora of the features and polish you'd expect.

Straight to the point.

Good:
- The game has extreme potential. More than you would expect. This will definitely be one of the best boxing games ever made if done correctly.
- The game does offer a little excitement and suspense when you fight someone who actually wants to box instead of spamming (which will be fixed) and it goes to 12 rounds
- The combos hit extremely nice when at the right distance (better than fightnight IMO)
- The body punches are VERY smooth when they connect.
- There is a ""loose"" mode you can activate to move around the ring and this makes the movement extremely fun.
- There is a HUUUUUGE and I mean an addicting feeling of happiness after you go 12 rounds in a good fight that goes back and forth and you win or lose.
- The rank system is perfect IMO

Bad (excluding bugs and easy fixes) :
- Announcers say the same stuff a lot (somewhat fixed)
- you cant turn off motion blur and activate other graphic settings (fixed)
- There is no way to interact with other players in between rounds such as chat 
- The damage and stamina system need a huge overhaul. i.e: you should be able to see the other players stamina so you can see how much stamina you should use as well or at least show it after the fight. (fixed they show it after the fight)
- When you switch angles there is a lot of missed punches for no reason which takes away from the realism. (somewhat fixed)
- They need to expand the leader board as well, it only shows up to platinum.
- The judge system needs an overhaul as well, you shouldn't lose a fight if you are landing the most combos and power punches with the most counters no matter what. (somewhat fixed)
- There needs to be a way to avoid people crowding your space, currently anyone can crowd you and you cant get away without taking punches or entering loose mode. (not fixed)
- Of course there are several and i mean A LOT of bugs in early access which is why I wont list them but the three biggest issues are when in front of your opponent sometimes you get this ""stuck in the mud"" feeling like you cant move and it causes you to take damage. (not fixed) The other issue is spamming the right or left hook over and over again can get the win no matter what. THE HOOKS ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ITS ALMOST LIKE YOU CANT BLOCK THEM AT ALL,  LEAD UPPERCUTS AS WELL (fixed). Also sometimes your opponent can throw a hook and miss but you still get stunned or even ko even though he missed(not fixed). Which is really unacceptable for 30$.
- Edit (@130hours of gameplay): The more I play this the more i want to get a refund. Fortunately, ive never ran into a cheater and tbh i really dont think there are cheaters on here but people just dont know how to manage their stamina. But thats besides the point the next update has to fix the hooks and amount of punches thrown in a match(fixed). In no circumstances should some human be hit with 500+ punches and not get knocked once. In no circumstances should i throw 7 power punches to the head with a fighter with 90+ power and the guy doesnt take a lick of damage (somewhat fixed). 

overall (currently):
Gameplay: 6/10
Fun meter: 8/10 (really addicting if you're good)
Graphics: 8.5/10
Controls: 10/10


worth buying for early access right now?

- The Visuals are stunning. The Models look incredible and some of the boxers have incredibly lifelike animations.
- Hit reactions are quite nice with heads being popped back and body shots actually moving the opponents body, with flesh rippling from the impact.
- Punch impacts sound really good, much better than in Fight Night Champion.
- The presentation that IS there is really good, quite accurate to real life.
- Although not all present at the moment, the game has a huge roster with a lot of big names past and present represented.
- Generally speaking the feeling, look and sound of punching someone in the head/body is decent enough, unfortunately this is where the good points for this game (and most other boxing games to date) come to and end.

The Bad

- The commentary, it's bad. A small number of poorly written oft repeated lines read by two overly excited guys who sound like they're reading canned lines from a script rather than having a natural free flowing conversation. Hardly any boxer specific lines. There are even lines that sound as though the commentators are talking to you as the player, which is very strange and immersion breaking.
- The music. Unless you're a fan of UK rap, have an ice pick on hand as you will want to drive it through your brain.
- The presentation although good, is still lacking in some areas. There are no robes during entrances, and the entrances themselves are just a snippet rather than the full entrance. In between rounds goes on far too long with nothing interesting happening. Victory scenes are especially bad, with no entourage in the ring at all and only very basic presentation.
- There's too big a difference in speed and responsiveness between the big name fighters and the lesser known ones. Hell, even some of the big names feel pretty sluggish. Especially at heavyweight. I understand the devs wanting there to be a difference but I would argue it's actually counter productive at this point. A lot of people will only want to use the best fighters because of this, rendering that huge roster wasted potential. In real life the difference in speed between weight classes and between world level and domestic level is not this pronounced. If anything it's actually stamina that is more affected.
- The Knockouts. There are a few issues with the knockouts. The canned animations the opponent goes into when knocked out are incredibly obvious, immersion breaking and look pretty bad. The ""Get Up"" minigame itself isn't bad, but the way it cuts away and places you in the centre of the ring is extremely jarring. The random 1 Punch KO's are a bad idea, always have been. There are just some aspects of the sport that can't be simulated in a videogame.
- The stunned states are a little over the top, and basically render you completely incapable of fighting back. They either need to be toned down, or introduce a second minor stunned state.
- The damage system. It's tied far too closely to the stamina system. Playing against the computer I quickly realised it was far more effective to let the CPU tee off on me and deplete his stamina and then simply unload my combination on him as it would almost always send him into a stunned state due to his stamina already being low. This also makes body punching (especially uppercuts for some reason) far more effective than head shots. Essentially you're punished for going to the head and rewarded for going to the body, punished for initiating an exchange rewarded for ending it.
- The perfect block. Catching and countering is quite rare in boxing and when performed it often ends in a knockdown/knockout. In this game (especially against the CPU) it happens almost every exchange. It also punishes you for using the jab, against the CPU at least. Either implement it in a way that makes it difficult to pull off and a rare occurrence or remove it entirely.
- Upper body/head movement. A mechanic that has been poorly implemented in every boxing game to date, made worse in Undisputed. Like all other boxing games there's no proper bob and weave and you can't slip or weave while moving, rendering head movement useful only to defensive fighters who stand still waiting for you to come to them. Undisputed however somehow manages to make this even worse by making their ""Weave"" mechanic utterly useless and placing the actually useful ""Slip"" mechanic on Left Analogue Click which is extremely uncomfortable and unreliable in frantic exchanges.
- The footwork, although beautifully animated is actually fairly shallow with some serious flaws. Footwork was one of the things the devs talked up from the early stages of development, yet this is another boxing game where you cannot shift or pivot. On top of this you move too far too fast. Boxing is often a game of inches, an inch too close you get knocked out, a couple of inches back the punch misses completely. You simply don't have tight enough control over your footwork to control distance effectively the way boxers do in real life. Ever wondered why you often see people online exchange and then both back off completely to the other side of the ring, very unrealistically? This, I think is why. I also think it's why the camera seems to have trouble keeping up at times and causes performance issues. It simply can't keep up with the frantic movement, especially with all the flashing and shaking going on from the constant ""perfect block"" counters.
- The range on some of the punches just seems odd. I've seen a few people in the reviews point this out and I agree with it. It seems to be just as easy, if not easier to land an uppercut to the body from range than a jab to the head. And generally speaking it sometimes feels like you almost have to be standing on your opponents toes in order to hit them.
- The ""Haymakers"" or power punches, whatever you want to call them. Again same issue as with all the other Fight Night games, the wind up/charge is just ridiculous and something you would never see in a high level professional bout. Control wise it can also be an issue as some punches feel quite uncomfortable and difficult to pull off. There are other issues I could point to as well such as the clinch, but I'll leave it here for the bad points as some of these mechanics are obviously not properly implemented yet, and this ""review"" will never end if I do.

Suggestions

- Have power shots performed by holding down the button instead of using another button as a modifier and get rid of the wind up/charge. For example hold X to perform a ""power"" or ""stiff"" jab. This would improve the controls and would be a more realistic implementation of power punching with the downside being that you can't chain power punches together as quickly as normal punches as you have to hold the button down instead of just tapping it.
- Move punching off of the Right Analogue Stick to just the face buttons, and use the Right Analogue to control upper body/head movement. Perform slips by flicking the analogue in a direction, and the ability to weave by pressing the analogue in a direction and then rotating it towards another direction. This way, you could actually perform a proper bob and weave and could even chain weaves together. You could also utilise head movement while moving which would make head movement effective for come forward pressure fighters for the first time in a boxing game, and stop the game from turning into a counter punchers paradise.
- Introduce a ""Footwork Modifier"" button (preferably Right Bumper) to allow for advanced footwork such as pivoting and shifting. This would enable you to perform a proper check left hook, and even things like adding a pivot to the end of your bob and weave.
- Place ""Switch Stance"" on Left Bumper and move the ""Body Modifier"" to Left Trigger, and give the player the ability to punch while shifting by holding down the switch stance button and throwing a punch off the back hand.",1678852535,1682175275,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love the game so far. the core mechanics are great, the movement is great, graphics are very good. there is so much potential and the game is obviously very raw but if they keep listening to the community and take their time we have the best boxing/fighting game on our hands.

The list about what needs to change/improve is long. very long. but most is stuff that is fixable as imo the core of the game is good. I hope they keep it going. Great game!

Very beautiful graphics. Good fighter animations, decent control scheme - though I wish slipping was with right stick, I think the punch motion stuff is a bit gimmicky and not that useful, and I don't think its worth sacrificing a more intuitive way of moving+slipping. 

Slipping in general is my biggest criticism, as it very rarely feels responsive or helpful, except for the occasional lean back or duck down. Whether a slip is successful or not, regardless of how well you time it, seems to be very inconsistent. Makes it tough to use fighters like Joe Frazier or the newly added Floyd Patterson while remaining true to their styles. Joe didn't just walk in arms wrapped over his head until he was close to land, he utilised a lot of slips and weaves to get to the inside, which at the moment just isn't very practical for some reason. 

Aside from missing content like fighter creator and career mode, which will come in time, most of my criticisms are cosmetic. Some fighters have animations not as accurate to their fight styles as others - particularly many of the older fighters like Ray Robinson, Joe Louis, or Rocky Marciano, who all had identifiable movement styles in real life that aren't really captured all that well in the game currently. Another thing is the getting up from a knockdown presentation, which sometimes feels a bit odd when you pay attention to what the fallen fighter is doing - a lot of the time they seem to be knocked clean out and then they wake up, even if thats not what was shown happening before the knockdown minigame started playing, or the timer stops counting up long before the fighter gets to their feet - timing there should probably be adjusted a bit. And I would love replays and fight recording. It might be a small thing but I think it will add a lot to the experience when it is added.

All hail the boxing KING!After Playing for a while:  NOT A BOXING SIM!!!!!!!!!!!   I'm hoping they can fix the issues with this game.  The main issue I have is movement.  Not being able to move while slipping punches is annoying.  Not having the ability to move while ducking would be nice as well.  Fixing the movement issues would add depth to the fighting experience.  It would add more strategy to the fighting instead of the Rock'em Sock'em feel most fights have.  The fighter not moving at all at times is also annoying and always results in a dazed fighter.  Another issue I have is the fighting system.  I feel like I'm fighting the meters and not the fighter.  First fighter to drop another fighters meter wins. If my fighter is landing cleaner punches I would assume I'm winning.  That isn't the case here.  The stronger fighter would probably win because they would be able to drop my meters in less punches.  This results in fights that are more backyard brawl than boxing.   Other issues are the buffs.  Some are OP than others.  I feel buffs in general hurt the boxing experience.  It makes for a more arcade feel to the game giving players the idea that they can fight more reckless than if the buffs weren't active.I hope some of the issues I call out here get addressed.  🙏🏽🥊👊🏽

I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt because its still early access. But unfortunately you should only hope for an Robinson vs Robinson or Ali vs Ali match up.  Ali and Robinson can spam hooks in such a way where winning isn't even enjoyable. The game becomes a spam contest if your both the same character.

I have currently had over 300+ fights online and in Ranked I am 94-7. I've ran into a fair share of cheaters who can't be dazed or knocked out or have infinite stamina. There are a lot of buggy things in the game and major desync issues. The game has a huge lack of fighters to choose from, the judging is terrible and is scored differently at each venue (For example, you can dominate someone the entire round but they hit you with a few counter body shots and they will win the round at most venues). The boxing itself feels very very sluggish and slow even at the lower weight classes they are so slow. The female fighters are not even worth trying it is horrendous maybe one or two of them are okay the rest are terrible to play with. Directional punches or pushing forward attacking the punches are very slow and it just doesn't make sense. The desync is awful and you will get rocked without ever seeing a punch land. No instant replay after the fight or highlights of the round after each round which is annoying and should be a part of the game. The damage / swelling / cuts system needs to be re worked, it isn't balanced at all. Fighters are lacking performance mirroring the IRL fighter. The announcers comments don't make any sense after the rounds and are the same which gets old fast. Major counter attacks with power shots usually do not do anything and I personally have had fights where I have countered or landed clean power shots over 80+ times and the opponent was never even dazed but you can get flash knocked down or knocked out with a regular strike seemingly at random. People only play with the same 3-4 fighters and they are not balanced they are the OP fighters that are the only ones people will use even in unranked matches. People spam hooks with Ali and Robinson and they will daze you after about two of them with Ali. Even when you counter and outplay them its a gamble that the next one doesn't daze or drop you. It needs to be addressed. Your arms will get fatigue and you will feel like you're punching in quicksand after throwing more than 2 strikes with the same hand even just jabs. Another annoying thing is players that quit in ranked matches when you drop them and it doesn't count as a KO/TKO it counts as a surrender. People cheese fights and hit you a few times and run the entire round and win the round or counter your body a few times then run and somehow win the round even if you land more significant strikes and counters and press the action. The lack of updates and content are killing this game quickly, you'll find yourself fighting the same few guys online over and over occasionally. No career mode, no creating a fighter, no new fighters, and no new venues. The game is dying and the lack of updates are about to bury it for good. I can't recommend buying this game right now. It has potential to be great if the devs push things out a little faster and address some major issues.",1681356610,1681356822,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

My only other tiny nitpick would just be a little variety with the announcers, especially between rounds. Sounds like they always say the same general statement. Also, maybe a few variations in accents to the trainers talking between rounds.

No campaign, only quick fights and online fights available. Online fights are broken, AI fights are broken. They fucked up the game, don't update it as much anymore and honestly, if I could I would refund the game at this point; and not because I'm bored, but because this game's potential has went down significantly.

One random punch and all of a sudden it's a KO victory, no matter if my health and stamina was 99% at Round 6, just pristine fighting. But, fuck - what is this damage system, just...

edit: i play this game a lot as its the only boxing game active just now but its still pretty bad, spam is unreal, no boxing IQ needed and they recently did a patch to stop people disconnecting online which has resulted in every game online looking like a slideshow, the servers are so weak and just lags from round 1 to 12

2nd edit:i continue to play this game for anyone still on the rope about getting it.. i'd keep waiting, every match is like a slideshow online, still full of abusers such as people who constantly circle the ring and any attack you try to throw whiffs, resulting in them getting free counter punches for no skill involved, you've also still got the body uppercut spammers and hook spammers that continue to go unpunished as there is still no vulnerability system, the commentators are just generic voice-lines that don't match the game play, for example, you could knock someone down twice in a round and as the round ends they will still criticise that there was no action and it was a ""feel out round"". your corner continue to be generic also, my opponent could jab me once and nothing else happens in the entire round and my corner will tell me to push the pace because they are ""exhausted"" or ""knackered"" i really want this game to be good but unfortunately i beginning to lose hope that it ever will be judging by the fact there is still no working anticheat, no new content since release and still no change to online connectivity and even if your focus is offline play..the AI are either stupidly overpowered with input reads and such or stupidly f**king stupid and sit there like moist cabbages and just absorb hits until you decide to win..",1677476439,1680797891,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Spammers are insanely hard to counter tho and the philly shell defense is useless and every punch goes through it MAKE IT SO THAT THE PHILLY SHELL DEFENSE ISN'T USELESS. Even when using a high guard fighter like tyson fury, anyone long like muhummad ali is going to punch around it everytime. Sugar ray robinson is a different type of OP. He's fast, strong, and has insane stamina. Where he can power punch every couple seconds and have like 75% stamina at like the 10th round. The movement is really smooth, the straight punch is pretty bad when moving forwards and always inaccurate when moving forwards. 

 I recommend is a light buff to the philly shell defense where right hooks can be deflected with the left shoulder automatically and for high guard to be able to block hooks better also. And for the straight punch forward animation not be so low and for it to be head level when aiming for the head. This game looks great so far though. I just don't think it is worth $30 just yet. Also all the bots are counterpunchers at every difficulty. And they all exclusively target the body no matter what fighter you choose to fight. Counterpunches are glitched themselves, punching right after someone else hits you shouldn't count as a counterpunch. Spamming punches should deplete stamina much quicker, as of right now spammers can spam two punches and still can have a lot of stamina by round 9. Spamming punches should be punished with extra stamina depletion. Body punches don't seem to hurt recovery in the corner or stamina as badly as they should. As of right now the power straight spamming is outrageous because it is a very quick punch and the damage is plentiful. Boxing is barely possible in this game with the spamming problem. No matter how hard you try to properly Box, there is always a spamming strategy that will overpower it. Unless you have 230 hours in playtime and are really good with one boxer, you cannot counter spammers in anyway. No matter what if they spam a left or right hook, there is not enough utilities to use to counter the spam. I've played about 13 online matches and 12 out of 13 was spammers that spammed left and right hooks. There is no real boxing on this game. Fight night Champion was slower but you could counter spam with skill. Weaving doesn't take away stamina so someone could stand in the middle of the ring going in circles and if you punch the block then it's a counter punch, if you hit the body they will throw a power straight to the head and do lots of damage. If someone's stamina is low, they move at the exact same speed no matter what. All of the forward and side stepping attacks are extremely slow and impossible to execute.

I played the hell out of FNC and I see this being as close as we can get for a native PC version of that. However this has a long way to go. My first online match was against a cheater. It didn't even occur to me that would be desirable in a game like this... One google search later and sure enough there seems to be a rampant cheater problem.

My next 3 matches ended up being against people where you had a 1 red bar connection and continued to get rocked when the person was running into my punches. I wasn't even getting hit and I was getting rocked. I decided to give 1 more match a try... Same got dang thing. I don't think I'm gonna come back to this if they don't add some sort of servers or let us limit matches to a set amount of ping.

To my absolute surprise they have no replay system at all. I'm not sure if that is there to cover up and hide their janky animations or what. But how in the heck are you gonna release this game to early access with something as simple as a replay system. I appreciate the ambition and I truly would love to see this game flourish. I just don't have a good feeling about it yet and would almost rather play one of the Fight Night titles through an emulator, and play co-op through a horrible internet connection using Parsec than to deal with this. 

I appreciate the settings, graphics settings and gameplay settings in the game. All of those features are there and the game runs great on my system. However one HUGE complaint is the controls. You allow us to change presets but not individual binds. I want my binds set up in a way you do not allow us to. I want everything left alone and to swap LB with LT, that's it no other changes, no dodge and running change tacked on. That's apparently not allowed and the only want to rebind those is through external programs. Which is fine but it shouldn't be our only option. I'm not sure why keyboard isn't allowed either. I get it would limit leaning fluidly but it's still inexcusable to force people to use a controller. I don't mind using one, but I know plenty of people who don't even own a controller. I'm sure you could get keyboard to work using a external program. Again that shouldn't be the only option. 

I fully understand and am well aware this is a game in Early Access. That does not mean it gets a pass on anything I mentioned. We've all been following this since it was announced as ESports Boxing Club a few years back. I just feel like it needs more time. If you're all okay with the way it is that's fine. I am not.

And both these boxers made history.  Also, Hector  Camacho, Edwin Rosario, Danny Garcia.  

The commentary is lacking.  

It’s not that easy to get up after a knockdown:  honestly it should be alot easier.  

The game looks terrible on a 4K screen; it’s all stretched out.

REMEMBER:
 THIS is the ONLY boxing game as of the current that meets the reality and that is AVAILABLE in pc and is also an EARLY ACCESS with so much POTENTIAL

 MISCONCEPTIONS:
          HACKERS DOMINATING = no, i stand 316-35-0, and has defeated most of em once i realize that they are i immediately change my playstyle.. ALSO roughly out of 20 matches, only then il meet one of em and not even a guaranteed.. 
MOST OF THE TIME those who complains about the hacks being massive in the game are the ones who only rely on one playstyle and in return gets owned..

        DESYNCED = yes, it does, but because of latency difference that players country has, and i think u r being scored by ur hits alone minus the hit of the opponent, example ( u make a hit +1 but to your oppenents view he blocked it so hes +1 as well and so its equal to 0) so u goota place those punches somewhat in advance so when hi misses, he wont be able to block it as fast as he can.

WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND:
             - THIS is the ONLY boxing game as of the current that meets the reality and that is AVAILABLE in pc.
            - VERY competitive, forces you to switch styles every match since you wont know who they picked
            - ITS LIKE AN RTS coz u really have to strategize your  punch distribution of stamina when, to use power punches as 
 well
            -  THE GAME EFFECTS is immersive
            -  GAME where being patient is rewarded
            - Graphics are REALLY GOOD
            - NOT TOXIC
            - NO YEAR NEXT TO ITS NAME = meaning it will be updated from year to year and WE WONT HAVE TO BUY 2k24 UNDISPUTED LOL.. HOPEFULLY which to me as a sport guy is really a bang for my buck!

TIPS:
          OVRALL RATINGS doesnt totally  matters not unless you are fighting against really good player.. so try to  be comfortable and do quick matches.. every character has to excell in certain playstyle.. u dont just pick someone who is good at body jabs and expect to win against cannello toe to toe at body hits.. EVERY CHARACTER DEPENDS ON THE PLAYERS PLAYSTYLE so u have to have an arsenal of playstyle to counter those playstyle..

Now that Early Access is out, I badly wanted to give my thumbs up but I have to be open. Hopes are that this review will shift positive in the coming months!

Picking it up for the first time after a long wait, safe to say it played how I imagined. Solid foundation, although given it's Early Access, the tuning and balancing is horrific. A few things (punching while weaving, remove pop up scorecards in ranked, more elusive weaving, weaving while moving, stamina, power punches, countering, cuts) can be changed/added of course; as previously stated though, the foundation at it's core is well developed. Reached Undisputed with a record of 72-28-4, in it's CURRENT STATE, I recommend saving your money. I secured this on EA release for the discount from the price it'll be come full release (presumably $60-70). Aside from that, if you're not a hardcore or at least decently interested boxing fan, anything above casual, don't touch it. Even then, the devs are currently working towards fixing the AI with tendencies being non existent, stamina being broken, difficulties are unbalanced, etc. Quick fight isn't bad, although I'm sure most are concerned about ranked. I can confidently say I wouldn't touch ranked with a 10 ft pole at the moment. If you're here for the long run, go ahead and secure it and stay around for the upcoming patches.

There needs to be a vulnerability system if it is to be a simulation game, when you swing a punch and are correctly blocked and countered that counter should stop your next punch's momentum and give the opponent a moment to line up their next punch thus making you have to COVER UP or MOVE. But in this game that's not the case at all, you can truly put in some epic footwork and head movement/block timing and your opponent just needs to stand there and punch as you come in and spam down each side of your head health.

It angers me to come out of an 11-12 round fight where I win by knockout FINALLY after brutalizing and out-boxing my opponent and see that the opponent has been able to throw more than double my total punches, inefficiently (usually 25-30% accuracy) and have my L and R head sooo damaged. It makes NO SENSE!

I don't recommend this game until these issues are fixed because as it stands it is not even close to a boxing simulation.

I had to fight the AI rather than an online player simply because online connectivity is horrible.

- Spammers - Hook and jab spammers have been a problem since the game first came out and to combat this, they decided to make hooks stronger instead of providing stamina drain and arm fatigue. Those features were in UFC 1 and 2, preventing players from using the same move over and over again.

- Health depletion - When a fighter's head or body health is reduced, they are still able to withstand even further damage before they are even ko'ed. Rocked moments are absolutely useless since blocking is op even in those moments.

- Blocking - Blocking is a fundamental problem with the game coinciding with the punching mechanics. During rocked moments, punches have little to no effect as you play. And players wonder why most matches go on too long when YOU'RE the one winning.

- No arm fatigue - Like I said previously, there is no arm fatigue preventing these players that just hold block from being susceptible to punches. Again, a feature that was in a game almost a decade old.

The last thing I will say about this game, and I hope it reaches the developers is this, You have pretty much copied EA's Fight Night here but have not branched off or did anything to make this game enjoyable or fun. You continue to implement these random updates that either do noting, or harm the core gameplay. If you want this to be the next big boxing compared to it, fix the core problems of the game instead adding miscellaneous things like new boxers and venus, don't nobody care about that.

Pros:
Satisfying sound effects 
Fun and realistic gameplay
Modern graphics that put it on par with the UFC games
Male AND Female boxers 
Adjustable damage slider to make fights more realistic or Fight Night-esque
Decent amount of arenas for an 'early access' game

Cons: 
Not worth the price for the current amount of content (Career Mode and Create-a-Boxer coming soon)
Commentary is shallow, repetitive, static and feels like a gigantic placeholder just for ACTUAL commentary. 
Can't turn off commentary without turning off ALL dialogue (Including ref's counts)
Physics are a little wonky
Sometimes sound cuts out briefly 
No training mini games to help you master mechanics like leaning and slipping 
Needs more boxers and classics like Holyfield, Tyson, Pacquiao, Mayweather, etc. 

Overall: 6.5/10

The A.I. stamina literally NEVER goes down. 12 rounds in and the A.I. stamina remains full, all while the user stamina is all the way depleted. I can see why career mode is unavailable...they have no clue how to program the A.I. to have a fair match. If you drop the difficultly it's way too easy. Turn it up just to pro and the A.I. counters EVERYTHING perfectly, your hits have a hard time connecting even with your opponent literally right in front of you....oh yeah, and if you string together combos against the A.I. he will just shake it off like nothing happened then hit you with ONE counter and your now running for your life.

Same problems bleed over to the online experience, but you have many players that just exploit bad gameplay. If you aren't a ""I need to find the glitch"" type player and just want to have an authentic and skillful experience it probably wont happen. This game is not enjoyable right now. Seems like they just focused on graphics and that's it. The gameplay needs a complete overhaul. Presentation is ok, nothing to write home about...could be a lot better.

I believe this game has great potential and is one of the better boxing games i have played but requires some fine tuning to specific areas to really enhance the gameplay and not impact the fun factor which currently i would say issues exist that require improvements. This is early access i understand so i will just mention what can be improved and recommendations. 
-Dsynch needs improving commentator voice delays(2 voices heard at the same time occasionally, being hit with ghost punches  . delayed punches thrown, opponent that appears closer or furthur while glitching so u can time your attack and defense.  

-Punch transitions are not smooth I cant confidently throw a 3 to 5 punch combination and know the punch speed will be the same every time and punch buttons press in order would be the punches seen. Especially seen when throwing uppercuts  and straights. Punches are slow delayed with most of the rota of fighters and punch animation doesnt show full punch. Punch transitions need adjusting throughout 

-Improvement to online opponent selection required. Due to ping issues i have various opponents leaving the fight soon as it starts. I believe team should make those closer to our location selected with the best connection. Could also introduce server searches so you can select the opponent with the best connection or specific servers . Also enable the ability to see your opponent ping before pressing go to fight them rather than to wait 3-5mins for opponent to leave when fight loads and starts.

-Head movement slip rolls feels stiff. This needs adjusting where by you can rotate the analog stick to move your head 360 with natural movement to set up counters and avoid punches. At the moment slip roll is unreliable and usually means i would only pull to avoid opponents punches. Also trying to slip is very slow and usuall by the time you have slip a punch your opponent already pillar block as its too slow. 

-angle changing and being able to pivot doesnt exist. I cant seem to change the angle smoothly and counter or set up certain punches. when on the ropes i cant pivot out which allows by opponent time to land more punches. I find my self holding a pilar block and moving out as the only option. Also the ability to change  fighter stance from orthodox to southpaw (switcher) doesnt exist. 

Latest Update feedback march 15th- I find that since the update its very easy to get rock and stay rock. For eg my opponent would rock or drop me vice versa and when your up you stat in red and only require one punch to get drop again. This even happens early in the fight round 1 would is not realistic. This needs adjusting again to allow recovery to be based on stamina also remaining. Eg earlier in fight quicker to recover/later in the fighter takes longer to recover when getting up from being drop and moving around. 

Recommendations
-A major difference between the less and more popular fighter stats seem to exist where by everyone is  selecting the tyson furys and roy jone jr's of  the game in order to win more fights. Fighters light Conor Benn and kell brook feel really slow and stiff when in real life they are both known for movement. fast punches and explosive counter boxing. Stats shouldnt massively affect technique as it should come down to the player behind the controller rather than a massive advantage given to players who pick the 90-95 stat fighters. I notice odd punch and movement animations with fighters in the 70s and early 80s overall .  more Balancing required so all fighters feel smooth to use and not massively impacted by stats.

-issue with power punches they are delayed and the boxer some what power ups like a tekken move the punch. Speed of the punch delivery if anything should be faster and power punch animation needs to be more realistic and responsive. At the moment power punches take too punch time to land especially power hooks uppercuts.
-Recommendations
-Training - introduce the ability to select the type of sparring partner and want the sparring parner to do eg work body, counter box,  brawler style , come forward fighter, box from the outside etc. Also introduce a heavy bag to practice so users can  get use to the punch mechanism as i am aware over 70 punches etc but possible only know 40-50.
 add the ability to send your opponent a message at the end of the fight like good fight, easy work. lucky, well played,  close one etc. Also at the end of the fight add a rematch button so you can rematch your opponent if the person agrees. 

add cinematic replays after a knockdown/knockout also at the end of the round and fight etc.

Damage system introduce more realism. Eg injuries like cut above eye your vulnerable to more punches from that side as blood goes into your eye , broken nose affect stamina, torn rotator cuff slow punch, unable to throw a punch from that side and also defense impaired, ruptured achilles slowed movement and less power on the punches thrown etc.

Add more taunts - At the moment only 3 exist and it tends to get boring doing the ali shuffle, look away and spinning of the arm with all the fighters. Fighters should have different taunts and you should also beable to select specific ones.  

Bring back cruiserweight division to online play also add more fighters.

Overall the game has great potential but requires alot of work especially to the punch mechanics/ punch animations/ balancing of fighters stats and online play.  i understand this is early access but alot of work still needs to be done in order for this to be considered a great boxing game. However in the current form undisputed features great aspects that makes it enjoyable to play but also issues that impair the fun factor that requires urgent work from the dev team.  Once the team are able to work on the issues mentioned and also add a career mode and various other modes this could be one of the best boxing games created.
















 also occasionally when i select a fighter i cant deselect and go back to choose another. The screen will be stuck on loading.

For example, a punch from canelo shouldn't be the same as a punch from roy jones in speed or power. (not to say one of them hits harder than the other). 

I did notice that roy jones is a little slow in the game, but realistically he had some of the fastest hands in boxing, especially  when he was in 160 and he was faster than others on his feet as well so he can get in and out a lot faster than other boxers. Every fighter feels like their movement speed and punching speed is the same. They feel clunky. Not agile enough.

Have the developers study fighters like mayweather jr, and shakur stevenson to see how fast they were at shooting jabs and doing a quick step back (not lean back) to completely make fighters miss.

Have the developers study fighters like roy jones and mayweather sr to compare how fast they were compared to their opponents.

Have them study Michael Nunn and Ali a little bit more to see how evasive they were by being able to sit just outside punching distance and still have the ability to shoot that jab or 1, 2 then arch back to the outside range.

Another thing is when you throw straights you should give the player the ability to reach in a little bit more when they shoot the straight. Over-extending. 

I can go on forever about fighter stances, athletic ability, and variations of jabs and other punches. But I'm a dev also and I know getting features out takes time, plus what I mentioned above would be a great start.",1679201283,1679201283,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

- the AI rarely approaches you in the fight you have to approach them meaning that you are the aggressor which is OK some of the time but it makes counter punching extremely difficult, this is made worse by how slow the ""stepping jap"" mechanic is. It is quicker to throw a right hand then a jab and if you want to throw a good combination you have to stand still while the AI walks away and you cant chase them as when you follow them and throw a jab its so slow that they get a counter 99% of the time 

- the way they show the cuts and swelling is very interesting however in 3 fights where i made sure to almost only hit the left side the cut and swelling never progressed past stage one which is very unsatisfying

- this game feels like it has good potential with how fluid a fighter can be but some mechanics like how a power hook honestly takes so long to throw its ALWAYS countered with a body punch it makes the mechanic feel useless and instead you thow thousands of tiny punches in a match and you rarely get the feeling of dominating a fight 

- INCREASE THE SPEED OF THE STEPPING JAP OR JUST GET RID OF IT 

- the blocking mechanic is good and is more similar to the UFC games however when fighting a smaller fighter you only have to block your body tbf the AI pretty much only throws body shots however when fighter smaller fighters a body block seemed to stop a lot of head shots 

- the game has plenty of potential and could be good but right now it feels very unpolished and most time you will win a fight but feel like you have lossed because you'll throw 1000 punches hear the same voice lines 100 times and get the most unrewarding knock out ever after throwing 100 right hooks which is the only reliable punch 

THE best way i can describe this game is its Fight night champion but all the boxers feel like they have cerebral palsy

Okay... I´ve decided to expand the review...

Undisputed is the first good boxing game for PC that I´ve seen. The boxer moves feel smooth, they have different parts of the body so you can see the damage done in each part individually and if you´ve played Fight Night, then this game is for you as it works with a similar mechanic. There are a lot of venues and boxers to pick up from and different weight classes... the most important feature that I have seen in this and not another boxing games (except in ready 2 rumble and those arcade-ish games) is that we can choose women to box as well.

Cons
- Knockouts. Knockout I feel are one of the most exciting things in any fighting games. The satisfying feeling of rocking your opponent and watching them hit the canvas. Unfortunately in the games current state, knockout animations are extremely lack luster. Every knockout consist of your opponent stumbling and slowly going to the ground. I would love to be able to feel the power of my knockouts. I want to see my opponents slam to the canvas after a viscous upper cut. It is extremely underwhelming and I hope this is improved in later updates.

-Punches not registering. This may be a nitpick but I have noticed in every single match I have played I will swing at an opponent and very obviously land a direct shot and it ends up not registering and has 0 effect

-Gamemodes. As of now the game lacks many modes outside of local matches and online play. They have announced that a career mode and create a character are in the works but as of this review there is very limited things to take advantage of

-Commentary. The commentary in this game is extremely repetitive and a lot of the time doesn't relate to what is happening in the match. Example: I am dominating an opponent to the point of bleeding and several knock downs while I have barely been touched and the announcers will say something like ""Those score cards must be close I can't imagine who they have winning this one""

Pros
-Gameplay. While I had a few complaints of the gameplay, I love it overall. Combos feel fluid and satisfying. Dodging, blocking, punching all feel great and are very easy to learn

-Graphics. The graphics are absolutely amazing in this. The fighters look incredible and very similar to their real life counter parts. Skin ripples as punches land, cuts look gnarly and authentic everything looks absolutely awesome

-Arenas. While I feel a lot more can be added, the variety of arenas are great. You can fight in a gym, an opera theater, an outdoor venue, a stadium there are lots of unique choices

-Roster. While there is room for a lot more legends and fictional characters, the roster here is what I have been wanting. Being able to fight as wilder, fury, garcia is awesome and something I have been waiting for. Can't wait to see who else is added

Undisputed is a game that is lacking many components but is a game with ultimate potential to be the best boxing game of all time.

- The graphics are beautiful
- Core mechanics are there for a great game-play eventually.

The negatives

- Single player AI is plain bad. PRO difficultly  AI  focuses mostly  on body attacks but still can be out boxed easily. Hardest difficulty AI becomes a counter attack magician with infinite stamina. 

- There are only two single player options but it's forgivable since the game is still in EA.

- Game is just tragic in terms of balance. The best inside fighter the game offers is M.Ali who can knock anyone out with two right hooks. Ali's power is over 90/100. Anyone who knows boxing only diagonally will know how ludicrous such stats and powers are.  On the other hand D.Wilder will land 150 power straights and it will have little to no effect on his opponents. 

- The game encourages spamming and abuse of it's disgustingly bad mechanics. The best way to knock somebody out is to keep punching the same side of his face with the same punch ala Ali's right hook. You might be out boxing Ali all fight long but there is high probability that he will stun you thus eating a good chunk of your health and eventually knock you out. If you are facing Ali player who has a double digit IQ with a fighter who isn't Ali or Fury your in for a stinker. Thus when playing ranked matches in HW only fighters you will face will be Ali and Fury. 

- This game rewards borderline brain dead players who see red when they get mad. So far seems that developers of this game are not listening and fixing the main issues the game have. I can only recommend this game to people who DKSAB. Everyone else skip this turd until the balance issues are resolved. 

- Issues to resolve
Superhero fighters 
Body uppercuts 
Step back straight spammers 
Hook spammers 
Players who refuse to ever punch first
Create ability to slip while moving forward

The fighters are well-made.

However, if you're interested in only playing online, I want you to beware that many cheaters have emerged in the last couple of weeks - which doesn't make it enjoyable. Rarely I'm getting matches where I don't get KO'ed in the first couple of rounds of the game where my opponent can land 8-10 hooks combos without getting tired. 

If you're only interested in playing offline, do not get this game at this stage; career mode still needs to be supported (work in progress), so you can only play quick matches. The fighter creator still needs to be ready too. 

This early access laid out a strong foundation for the future. If the game keeps getting developed, then I'm sure it will succeed (sceptical about the Online mode because it's on PC, so cheat engines are much easier to implement).

The ultimate boxing game that only needs to fill-out the roster displayed during the ESBC reveal videos | I would love to play as Nonito Donaire and fight against Inoya, or.. the Barrera / Morales additions.
For welterweight so many amazing boxers had been announced - Hell I'd love to play as Tim Bradley! 

The only disappointing thing thus far is no announcement for Manny Pacquiao - We have legendary boxers in various weight-classes | I need to have both Pacquiao and Mayweather in the game. 
I understand if the developers don't know how to balance Manny Pacquiao's overall rating compared to everyone else... any other excuse isn't acceptable. With the motion capture for the most accurate movement from boxers for me the most interesting punching style, defensive and movement style would be Manny.

With that rambling complaint aside the game itself feels like Fight Night with additional strategic movement and punch options. Cutting angles feels amazing - nothing like getting beat round after round to get a one punch (near no stamina) uppercut after reading my opponents defenseless movement. 

(Fury vs Ali - clip link is here: https://clips.twitch.tv/FurryIntelligentRutabagaStinkyCheese-X3rRJelbbVz71v8p )

Sugar Ray Robinson vs Sugar Ray Robinson - round 3: I have been knocked down twice, but I utilized near perfect defense while staggered and at immediate recovery allowing this brutal power KO (power left hook, moving into a power right hook). My ranked opponent seemed to break his controller or leave in anger as it was only the first knock-down and he would have been able to get up with more stamina than I had remaining. That's a complaint for my opponent but it makes a helluva KO in a cinematic sense. 
Clip of this below:
https://clips.twitch.tv/SillyStrangeTubersRickroll-qF16tqI32pXlgemX

I love playing the weekly (once a day attempt) match-ups, I often will play against the CPU in 15 rounds to work on my stamina moderation to translate over into my ranked multiplayer play.

outside of missing 100 of the boxers announced during a year+ long reveal campaign... I hope these are still included in the road map (ESBC turned into Undisputed therefore I am unsure... someone will clarify in the comment section).
I look forward to the boxer creation, career mode and all of the great stuff coming to the game - now is the time to start playing - get the advantage and start learning the best boxing experience ever made. 

Let's work dedicate servers for fights rather than player lobbies | Leap is a recent crossplay game that has a server browser and is better for having dedicated servers.
If the server number is over-allocated it would essentially still be the same queue as waiting for a lobby formation... or even better add a SPECTATOR MODE for servers. By hitting Ready Up you are confirmed to fight next and get to watch the fight as if it was a duel in an arena shooter! This would be a HUGE move for not only the esports community but casual players as well. 

Let's get some chat in game (keyboard / text based is fine as the primary method  - voice can be a secondary option). 

Let's hurry up and patch in being able to switch stances as many boxers I want to play as my MAIN (Crawford) his benefits are destroyed for online play; if I can't rapidly switch stances I am unable to cut angles / utilize the closest punch or to utilize it for defensive purposes. 

Alright with that said the base experience we have thus far is easily the best boxing game released | I'm going to score it based on just the feel of the game-play

88/100 | Can easily be a 94-95 rating with these fixes and additions - perhaps even a close to perfect / the definitive fight game experience with dedicated servers and the ability to spectate players.
I'd just add a lobby of all current matches in-game with the ability to view them from the menu or load in full-screen. 
( this is something Project 1v1 had during it's QA phase before development stopped )

- PS -
Online leagues currently exist but some force players to use some sort of cloud gaming network for consistent network play which has its own input latency problems according to the various streamers I spoke with about this topic.. I have not tried this software myself but this is a huge problem when the community needs to engage in downloading and enforcing restrictive rule-sets | when the game is released on console platforms cross play will be tarnished with having enforced software in order to play.

 1st: If you think a well timed right hand from Deontay Wilder will get you a spectacular knock out or maybe a beautiful timed counter to the liver while your opponent is gassed out, you'd be completely wrong.
This game favors spamming your shots, if you got Ali spam his lead hook until you knockout your opponent through their guard. If you have Tyson Fury spam his lead straight until it gets you an easy with.
2nd: If you think you're going to be able to play with your friends with an easy UI and a simple invite to lobby button,  you'd be completley wrong. Instead you have to read to them a 10 digit code to get into your lobby. Whats that? you want to rematch your friend? sorry we don't have a button for that you'll have to go back start a new lobby and send the new 10 digit code to your friend.
3rd: I am here to say and you can view it yourself under my screenshots, ive beaten fighter with 132-10 records by simply spamming bodyshots/hooks/straights. I have a good record but can't tell you without a doubt today is the day I uninstall, winning is fun but a game that plays better and a development team that responds to their community concerns is way more important.

K.O’s need to be more convincing. KO’s in previous fight nights had a better system. I throw 10 clean hayemakers with Wilder and the opponent doesn’t go down. Jabs seem to have more impact on an opponent. Ok thats not realistic. The KO system/Damage/the opponent needs to go down more dramatically. The KOs need to be more violent. Observe KOs like Tyson or Tommy Morrison. Even wilders KOs are brutal in real life. Bring that brutality aspect when it comes to KOs and get the damage ratios right. A jab will do less damage than a straight or a hook or uppercut. The power shots need to increase the chances of a KO and not after 10 shots but at least after 2 shots the opponent needs to be rocked if it lands flush clean. Thats just how it it is in real life. 

-Please Bring Tyson with the peekaboo style to this game. Just like in real life.
Tommy Morrison Butterbean George Foreman would be a great addition to the knock out artist roster too.

Otherwise I love where this game is going!

It is necessary to pay close attention to OPTIMIZATION. This, in my opinion, is the most important task Even players with good hardware experience a lot of difficulties, lags, freeze during the game. Of course, content is very important for development, but this is not the primary thing to do. If we take FIFA or NBA as an example, then their requirements are much lower, although they look more resource-intensive (I understand that they have big studios with huge budgets, but still).

About the rest of the problems, especially the online component, the developers are so aware. It's just that in my opinion, they have little feedback on optimization.

Personally, I would like to ask to add a Russian localization, because the game has a large Russian-speaking community around the world. And I also want to see Mike Tyson in the game! But first optimize.

The multiplayer is ridiculously laggy. No other game has lag like this. The best way to win is to throw the same punch repeatedly. The ai on the highest difficulty isn't challenging, you just have to cheese them by throwing the same hook to the body or head and let them gas themselves out. The fact that the damage is targeted to specific parts of the body makes the game awful on top of the horrid glitches and lag. There's issues where your punches become so slow it's insane, just not realistic in the slightest when you are low on stamina. meanwhile the AI will spam combos the whole match. Multiplayer is damn near unplayable so I can barely even comment on it. I can't recommend this at all and I'm terribly disappointed. I understand it's early access but it's not looking promising. Updates aren't coming out fast enough. considering the stage the game is in, they're rare. They should've spent less time scanning fighters faces and put effort into the game itself. The fact it's been pushed back so much and this is the product they've released is embarrassing, regardless of it being early access. I'm honestly pissed. How did they not realize the issue with the targeted damage system? Just take two steps back and spam hooks. That's the whole game. The only time I've seen an actual knockout and not a TKO is from the AI randomly putting me on my ass after winning every round of the fight because of the targeted damage. On lower difficulties you take unbelievable amounts of damage and far too much focus is put on counters when dodging just doesn't work. Your punches often won't land when they should be. The distance you throw your punch randomly changes and can't keep up with the pace of the game. If you play this casually you might enjoy it. Good luck getting a game online that isn't totally fucking laggy. And have fun never knocking an opponent out even when you have Wilder spamming his right. Needs serious work before it can be taken seriously at all. 

The things they advertised aren't there. The most damage you'll see on fighters are bruises and black eyes on their face. Not even redness on the body. Everytime you get a tko(every fucking fight) the same terrible animation occurs where the player flops over like a fish with their eyes wide open. Why are they suddenly unconscious from a TKO? This needs an insane amount of changes to be made before it can be played competitively. In fact, you barely can play online at all. Seriously disappointing. 

There's also hackers already. There's so much that needs fixed, this honestly shouldn't even be on steam.

Edit: Glitches have gotten worse since they've released a couple updates. Often times my fighter will be frozen whenever I am rocked. Can't move, can only throw punches and block, even in single player. some how there is even serious input delay in single player. SRR is still horribly overpowered and you'll run into people running in circles around you the entire match and throwing an occasional jab for the W because of how ridiculously OP a boxer they've ""nerfed"" is. AI is still god awful. They'll gas themselves out spamming punches on the highest difficulty. On lower difficulties they're just punching bags. Online is still a laggy, glitchy mess with people using the same 3 overpowered boxers so it's not enjoyable at all.

It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.
So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.

02/16/2023 every update seems to make the game better. developers are very responsive to the community and seem to be taking in some consideration pertaining to tuning and fixing issues. this game will be GREAT and i plan on buying 3 copies once full release is out. its turning out to be a realistic boxing game not a arcade rock em sock em.

03/01/2023 After update game is trashy as F^ . I keep getting disconnects right when i open the game and sometimes after i join a match. Why .... man  im close to giving a BIG THUMBS DOWN. This game is worse than fight night spamming, complete garbage. i dont want to have to throw one punch over and over and over to be competitive.  Why is it when i catch my opponent with CLEAN power shots i get penalized by a sudden stun as if he hit me with the power punch. The regular punches do more damage and harm than your implemented power shots. Tired of the trash.... the update content is awesome , game play broken. Why do you use the same ufc damage gauge its a retard gauge, get rid of it. The damage gauge will ruin this game for me sorry its not fun when you can easily exploit the gauge. its not a real feel with the retard gauge, its built for spammers not true fans of the art of boxing. I mean if the gauge was cool my jaw bone would be hangin off my face , or a broken rib, or a broken hand.. but the game isnt that cool it just looks good graphic wise just like all new games...Why wouldnt you put  broken hands , ribs , cheekbones, eye sockets, nose, jaw, hematoma. This is why i clown the damage bar , because if you want your game to be a simulation of the real thing the bar must go or be refined. Fighters have finished fights with broken hands, jaws ribs and all else stated above. Being fight fans you know this, but why not put this in the game as a rare occurrence. Thats where the bar draws the what could have been an immersive experience into just a teen arcade button smasher. Im middle aged and i want to see someone actually make a real boxing simulation game. Let the kids wait for content , please address all exploits. Will they get it right? 

03/11/2023  No update past two week period. I think we have'nt had an update because they are addressing cheaters and spammers alike. I have made the last update work for me by changing tactics a bit against the cheaters and spam addicts. I think next update will help us true boxing fans who love the sweet science. 
Number one priority should be Ali power in his punches, he hits like Rocky. When I fight an Ali abuser. I mean user, I'm like dang' Tyson is in the game.... Anyways I am sticking by the devs and believe they can turn their product over into an awesome game for all. The new outside venue and the neon gym fight scenes are my favorite.

The only bad thing was the people quitting and you getting an L on your record. 

After the update, the computers W key you so much on just pro difficulty, undisputed is even worse. You cant even admire the footwork, bc it cancels the animation bc the computer only moves forward for the first 3 rounds. 99% Body shots are unblockable as of 2/16/23 even while timing the trigger as their about to hit you, and leaning the proper direction. Due to body shots being unblockable, the CPU spams them at an ungodly amount. Fix the W-Key of the computer, and fix the blocking in the body shots, and I will update my review.

1) graphics: this is a tough one, I can see some people prefer the lean towards realism in Undisputed, however I feel that over the years as graphics and animations continue to improve it will become more obsolete whereas the simplistic 8-bit style of punch out still holds up 36 years later. Leaving this one a draw.

2) gameplay: again it’s a toss up, but I think I have to give this one to punch out, when you hit the buttons on your controller they will always do what you expect giving you the control over your character you want. Undisputed is a descent control scheme, but there are definite frustrations where sometimes the same punch may feel like it’s extending different distances making it hard to judge what will happen when you hit the button, leaving you wondering if you’re in control of your character, or if the game is.

3) sound: this one is a draw where I give the soundtrack to punch out with its memorable tracks. It’s atmosphere is also decent with a cheering audience making you feel like you’re right there with them watching the fight. However undisputed has great sounds that feel real like you are truly inside the ring, like you are the one there fighting not just another spectator watching an exciting match.

Bonus: I feel punch out has a more memorable cast of characters with each fight feeling like a unique experience and you have to know your opponent and approach each fight a different way tailored to their style and move set, it has a great scaling difficulty as you move up the rankings toward your goal to be champion. However in punch out there is only one playable character vs a cast of 50+ playable fighters in Undisputed, unfortunately even with all those characters there are maybe like five memorable ones who anyone will care about, and fighting each one does not differ greatly, you can approach all your fights basically the same way. As far as scaling I can’t fairly judge due to the current lack of career mode which gets a pass as an early access title.

So to end my review, I feel punch out K.O.s undisputed in this one, going down as one of the all time great classics it will be hard for another similar style game like Undisputed to compete. That’s not to say Undisputed isn’t a hard hitter in its own right with lots of potential and fun matches to be had along the way!

So far, I've been very impressed with the effort put into this game by Steel City Interactive. At my time of writing, the roster consists of titans across time, from the veterans era of Joe Frazier and Sugar Ray Robinson, to modern phenoms such as Tyson Fury and Saul 'Canelo Alvarez.

Aspects I like:

- Engaging and step-by-step tutorial
- Slick movement and realistic mannerisms for fighters (Muhammad Ali's light footwork to Canelo's high guard)
- Satisfying counter flashes which reward your timing.
- Venue crowds look good and do not resemble copy-pasted, hollow figures.
- Care and attention has clearly been placed into fighter appearances, facial scans and body types.
- Daily challenges and clear menu interfaces.
- The fact that the roster size will grow over time and boxer variety.

Considerations:

- The game is in Early Access, so don't expect a complete and polished experience just yet.
- Please remember this is a game that requires some patience and practice for new players, don't get disheartened as it makes you feel great when your shots start landing and your opponent can't lay a hand on you.
- I'd like to see some way of communicating with online players like how UFC 4 has it's gesture system, it would be nice to say 'Well Played' or 'Nice Shot' sometimes.

Cons :

Still lots of bugs, controls are really slow and not to really understand what the fighter is doing atm. There are times that im trying to move and my fighter just stays in position doing nothing especially after being rocked. Ofc most of the time that leads to a knockdown or a KO.  Its kinda frustrating and it happens often. Also Ghost punches? Getting rocked without seeing any punch and being 3 metres away? Online play :  idk, cheaters maybe? Fighters dropping 1000 punches and still having the speed of a rocket with no stamina affecting them? Another part is the game performance and connection. Its not the best, yet!

My only gripe, and it's an important one, is the utterly ridiculous knock down/get up mini game... it's awful.

Really awful.

- able to play either with buttons or R analog for punches
- Battle mechanics is very footsie oriented, which is good if you are into fighting games
- Good starting roster
- plays well for an early access game. I have not seen a lot of glitches

Cons:
- Online needs work. I've played three online matches with my brother and they all ended with disconnects. To connect with friends, you have to give them a lobby code rather than just invite them to the lobby. I assume this will change, though
- Sound effects needs more impact. Not sure how to describe it, but I don't get that impactful feeling from sounds when I land a heavy blow
- Roster is for the hardcore fans. The general population won't know who a lot of these fighters are
- Game feels a little lifeless
- The foundation is solid in terms of pace and speed comparing it to the EA pedigree, but I've always felt fighting sims (UFC/Fight Night franchises) always felt slow. I am a big fighitng game fan (MvC2/Street Fighter/Tekken/MK franchise), so maybe that's on me, but I'd like to see a speed increase, maybe 10-20%. Like...I can see the punch coming, but then the reaction of my fighter to block seems just as slow as the punch I clearly see.
