That being said, Shogun 2 is the last properly polished historical game from CA.  Great in singleplayer and co-op, all three expansions (though ROTS is the weakest) are good on their own and there's a high ceiling for the amount of enjoyment you can squeeze out of this game.

Would definitely recommend, especially when put up against other Total War titles.  Absolutely annihilated all TW titles released within the past 10 years.

•	Despite its age it is one of the best-looking Total War games
•	Some of the best art work in the entire series
•	Simple easy to use UI
•	Well balanced and useful technology tree
•	Last Total War game to allow players the freedom of having armies without generals and allowing for units to be moved independently from an army
•	Some of the best siege battle in the series
•	Battles can be won using low tier units if the player plays well – tactics matter and are not just based on having high quality units
•	Best implementation of firearms in the series
•	Fall of the Samurai expansion adds another time era, more tactical depth in battles and a larger campaign map for a reasonable price
•	Best implementation of trading resources and unique buildings that can provide significant bonuses to units making them a lot more dangerous
•	One of the few Total War games with meaningful diplomacy which can be affected by your Daimyo’s honour
•	Aggressive campaign AI
•	Realm divide provides a late game challenge to stop players from completely steam rolling the map unchallenged
•	Some of the most useful agents in the series
•	Avatar conquest allowed players to customise their own generals and armies for multiplayer battles

Cons:
•	Units frequently get stuck on walls in siege battles
•	Units can bug out during battles where only half of the unit responds to orders
•	Suffers from bad unit collisions where units blob up on each other
•	Main campaign map is a similar size to a single Medieval 2 Kingdoms campaign map
•	For some reason 12 years after release, they decided to change the mini map to a darker colour making it more difficult to view the mini map
•	After the 2020 update where they released a locked historical battle, my fps has been a lot less consistent during the campaign and in battles which has persisted on different PCs.
•	First Total War to implement the shameless Blood Pack DLC
•	Guard mode doesn't work!

There's very few games I go back to 10 years after the fact, and Shogun 2 ended up being one of them. Now that I have played every clan in vanilla Shogun 2, and three playthroughs of Fall of the Samurai, I can confidently declare that this is one of the best Total Wars, if not the best (based on your personal preferences). Some notes on why:

1. The AI is aggressive. This is important because defensive battles, ambush battles, and defensive sieges ONLY happen if the AI attacks into you, and the Shogun 2 AI is both incredibly aggressive and opportunistic on the campaign map. This means early game is very challenging, even on Hard difficulty, necessitating the use of ambush and defensive battles to turn the tides.

2. Successfully defending against aggression is satisfying. 

3. The music is stellar. This is the final game worked on by the Jeff Van Dyck, the composer for Medieval II and Rome TW. His musical genius is evident and he has a very strong grasp on memorable harmonies. Rome II and Warhammer Total Wars have music that simply melts into the background and are not very memorable in comparison.

4. This is the last Total War to utilize 1 HP units. This means that a volley of arrows are guaranteed to kill at least one person. This makes the fights feel lethal and punchy. In later Total Wars, each individual man has multiple HP, meaning a volley of arrows first softens them up, and only become lethal once their HP is depleted. This makes certain low damage units feel anemic and weak because of the gradual way they deal damage. In Shogun 2, every unit, even the lowly Ashigaru, has a certain level of lethality to them.

5. The battles are fast and decisive. The Samurai era is unique in that nobody carried shields. This means that projectile weapons are extra lethal, and the game has to be balanced around that. So what do you do when arrows and musket balls are so damn powerful? They make all the units move very fast. There are no slow plodding units in this game. Everything is lightning fast. The cavalry in Shogun 2 move faster than nearly every cavalry unit in Warhammer TW. Some people like this. Some people dislike this. I LOVE this.

6. There is a challenging late game. Every strategy game under the sun suffers from the snowball effect. You grow to a level of power that eclipses the AI and then the game loses all challenge and you quit the campaign out of boredom. Shogun 2 avoids this with Realm Divide. After your nation grows a certain size (about 1/3 of Japan), everybody bands together to stop you at all costs. This means there's an actual late game that can be challenging on higher difficulties (and challenging to unprepared players on lower difficulties). This gives you epic underdog battles where you're outnumbered 3:1 even 150+ turns into the game, something that almost never happens in other Total War games.

7. The sieges just work. They are the best sieges in the series. The walls are easy to dock on. There's lots of strategy falling back to inner layers of multi-layered castles. You can attack castles from multiple sides, baiting and feinting until you find the perfect angle to enter. All units can climb walls so it avoids weird pathing problems (looking at you Empire TW), but there's a significant cost to climbing them. Guns can actually dock and shoot from walls properly to devastating effect (compared to Warhammer TW, which fails at this in all three entries).

8. The roster is small but deep. Many later Total Wars fall into the common trap of elite units doing everything a lower tier unit does, but better. So you just replace all your low tier units and never look at them again past Turn 50. Shogun 2 tries to avoid this as much as possible. Yari Ashigaru, the basic militia spear unit, still has a place in the late game because it can form phalanx-like spear walls. While the high tier Yari Samurai, also wielding spears, is an offensive unit meant to chase cavalry and tie down enemy bows because it has a speed boosting skill but not ability to form a defensive formation. The lowest tier gun unit, Matchlock Ashigaru, sports a large unit size of 200 men. And while the Matchlock Samurai has better aim and higher stats overall, it only sports 120 men, meaning there's less potential firepower than the lower tier unit. The Ashigaru units can also be recruited from any province, making them easy to replace if one were to die in battle. These kinds of trade offs are all over the place, which adds a ton of depth to the roster.

All in all, this game is a 10/10 masterpiece and you owe it to yourself to play it if you like strategy games.",1707791669,1707791669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What really helped in this regard was the modding scene, I mostly just used QoL mods, extra maps, or minor vanilla-esque overhauls.

Unfortunately CA decided to give the game an update out of nowhere last year, to make it use their Total War launcher afaik. This unfortunately broke a lot of mods as a result - can't even use something like Strongholds of the Samurai without the game immediately crashing shortly after startup. And there's hardly anyone working on updating these mods cause the game is so damn old.

I didnt know Shogun 2 was made before Rome 2, there are so many missing features when playing this you can tell it was made in the early days on the genre. One feature I liked doing in Rome 2 was selecting a couple units and clicking and dragging with the mouse to move their position forward, cant do that here. You also have to unlock fire arrows and certain unit formations.

I was prepared to give all its faults a pass if the game was still enjoyable, however the straw that broke my whole body was the realm divide mechanic. I cant enjoy this game because of that.

Realm divide is the most dumbest mechanic ever devised. I hate it. It provides no replay value to this game. In fact, I will never play this game again. There is no diplomacy. Ever faction just declares war on you, no matter if they are a one province weakling with 2 units.

The AI cheats so hard in this game. The AI doesnt have fog of war, it knows where each of your ships are if they are alone even all the way on the other side of the map. They will make one ship and make a mad dash to the other side to kill that one trade ship or weak ship. How can they see? They are cheating, no fog of war. They dont play by the same rules as the palyer.

And because they can see everything, the AI will also get on ships and land armies behind you attacking undefended towns, they can see which ones are undefended.

AI will spam one million ships. This is absurd.

The AI also has unlimited gold and gold boosts and their units dont cost the same as the player. I conquered all of Japan except one province, I let them live. This one province, without a trade port, still managed to build a max stack army.

Because the AI has max gold, they will spam the spear samurai, I cant think of its name, but its better than the basic spear unit you can build form the start. Even two province clans will spam this unit.

AI will have max level agents on the map and will succeed in all actions against you, every time. How are they getting max agents so quickly? 

The AI will suicide 4-5 unit armies into your max stack all the time.

In the battle simulator, AI will suicide their horse units into your spears every time. Also, the AI will just find the nearest hill and run towards it, they will camp that hill until you come and get them. This is boring, every battle is the same. The AI in the later Total War games are better.

This means that there is very little variation in units beyond their moral-attack-defense statistics, but it also means that the battle outcomes are heavily dependent on your own tactical abilities. On the strategy side as well, you will learn the capabilities of your neighbors, so if you pay attention, no attack is a surprise.

Pros:
-Excellent wargame simulator
-Graphics have aged well
-Makes you feel like a Japanese commander

Unfortunately, all that said, the AI is terrible at tactics and always tries the same thing. If they are attacking, they rush and charge your archers. If they are defending, they sit there until you get too close. Then they rush. This is especially bad in naval combat, where you can easily wipe out entire fleets with about 5 ships.

Cons:
-AI does not understand tactics
-On large siege maps the bastions' path-finding is laggy, meaning units will take several seconds to go to and from bastions.
-AI sometimes tries to go after cities which do not make sense to target (e.g., across the map, or several cities deep into your territory.)",1706586212,1706586212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Attila has to be the worst of all I've played, it wasn't even playable. But this game Shogun 2 very much is playable and fun too! It really captured the classic Shogun feel with updated graphics and content. I loved watching the ninja mission videos in Shogun and I was happy they have them in Shogun 2 as well.
This is probably the best Total War game I've yet to play. I've had the game for less than a week and have over 60 hours of playtime already... yeah, I have no life but it also shows how entertaining this game is. This is a healthy mix of diplomacy, tactics, strategy, and warfare. Sometimes I get a bit overwhelmed in late game when I'm near total conquest because there is so much going on but I think that's because of my tactics which I will learn from and alter accordingly in future campaigns.

On top of that I found it difficult to progress in anyway due to the very intuitive, almost psychic AI opponents who always seemed maximize on my mistakes or setbacks.

Any time I tried to expand, which is kinda the purpose of the game, I would lose everything I had worked for despite my best efforts to consolidate.

So lets start with the negatives. First, I appreciate what they were trying to do with multiplayer participation encouragement and help intrigue but failed for longevity of players and revenue generation. Efforts into building a more involving single player would have been a more exponential growth winning plan. The DLCs are 50/50. The individual clan mods and hero adds to the original game are a fantastic addition while Rise of the Samurai is a waste of time and money. Fall of the Samurai DLC Generals' and agents' management, attributes, and actions are severely unbalanced. Overall this DLC is glitchy as hell but is still fun and a good purchase; to reiterate not great but not bad, just good. Historical learning events in the logs in all versions are absent and random events are more geared towards keeping a player ""in check"" rather than coordinating with actual historical events. Hard and Legendary campaign difficulties allow the AI to use cheat codes while stringently restricting player abilities. Facing odds that are mathematically impossible according to in-game economics is a serious lack of developer creativity. I don't mind going against AI cheats in premade skirmishes, but it should not be a staple part of the base game to earn achievements and game progression. It is possible to win under such conditions and it will take a seriously devoted player to achieve such, but a fair warning, it feels like work and not what I would consider ""fun"" for a game. Multi-player is 50% of the game and multi-player these days is dead. In these respects, history shows (google it), that the Devs and Company competently failed in both fun intrigue and revenue generation. They would have been better off not throwing so much money into multiplayer experiments where it was neither asked for nor ready to receive such a supply of. 80% Single player focus and 20% multiplayer budget and focus would have had a much greater reception and growth potential. Now let's talk about the good values. This is by far my favorite Total War game to play in Normal mode. Politics and faction behaviors are extremely historically accurate and precise. Civil, research, Army movement vs map size, win conditions vs map size vs turn allotment, and town building management is the best that this franchise has ever accomplished in my opinion. Units and battle game-play is one of THE most balanced vs historically accurate possibility results that I have come across and would place it in the top 1% of all single player RTS games to date.  Overall = The best historically accurate, single player, battle balanced, and re-playable value within the Total War franchise. Multiplayer is obsolete. Graphics are old but still compare better to some up-to date RTS games. Game management, settings, and options are cordially clean with minimal to no glitches detected outside of DLCs. A top tier worthy turn-based strategy game for the price of purchase. My favorite Total War game ever created.",1702019468,1703916466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The strategic depth of managing provinces, alliances, and armies adds a layer of complexity that kept me hooked for hours on end.

The game's visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack complements the atmosphere perfectly, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

Despite my penchant for playing PC games, Shogun 2's ability to blend history, strategy, and immersive gameplay kept me engaged throughout my extensive playtime. The strategic elements require thoughtful planning, and the real-time battles are nothing short of epic, making each campaign a unique and challenging experience.

Primarily, the naval combat is buggy to the ninth degree, thanks to patches introduced by the developers almost ten years ago which were never fixed. Ships can no longer sink, rendering cannons useless; the navy AI sits in place until you fire at it (at which point it scatters its ships all over the map edge, forcing you to slowly tour the map border picking them off); and the whole navy aspect is just frustrating enough that most players seem to disband their ships and play a land-only campaign.

There are user mods available to improve this, but they often introduce extra bugs, such as the notorious audio bug that makes archers sound like cannons.

If the developers had treated this classic with the respect it deserves, I'd have no hesitation recommending it wholeheartedly. But they didn't. Another salutary lesson in bad decisions from Creative Assembly.

The game feels very polished weather that be the sleek graphics in battle, agent videos, or the neat menus and tabs on the campaign map,  everything comes together very nicely. Unlike most previous games in the series, the campaign ai is aggressive and can easily end your campaign prematurely if you make to many enemies or neglect diplomacy which is a welcome change.  

Diplomacy has been improved greatly with the campaign ai generally making sensible decisions( e.g. they will usually accept any terms when close to being destroyed, allies will often offer money to assist them in wars, or offer to assist you in wars in exchange for helping them in their own)Allies  are easily the most reliable in the series and will normally not back-stab you unless you are allied with a treacherous clan, have become weak and failed to maintain good relations, or triggered realm divide(more on this later) , and have even occasionally send troops to help you in battles which is a refreshing change. 

The co-op or versus campaigns(when no connection issues are present) are a complete blast, coordinating attacks with your friends and building your empires together is satisfying and a very enjoyable experience. While it is unrealistic that you will both have armies in every battle, it is possible to give friends in the campaign units under your control in both the campaign, and on the battlefield allowing participation in each others battles, regardless of faction and distance from one another.

Now that we have spoken about what is good about the game, I will now discuss the main problems, the battlefield ai is hit and miss. Sometimes the ai catches you by surprise  with clever use of flanking, or whittling you down with massed archers when it has missile superiority, on the flip side the ai is prone to getting careless with it's generals, or playing far to passively on defense allowing players to take the initiate. It's most noticeably bad in sieges, where it often deploys it's troops awkwardly allowing them to be dealt with easily( e.g. leaving it's archers completely undefended) and will climb the walls every time, even if a gate to the castle is wide open, causing their troops to take unnecessary casualties and morale loss. Unfortunately though bad ai is nothing new to the total war series and  may stay this way for quite some time, however if this concerns you you may opt to allow a random player to take control of the ai armies on the campaign map to offer a (usually)greater challenge.
 
A lot of people are unhappy about the lack of variety in the clans, while each one has it's own unique specialty, and often gets a more powerful and cheaper, variant of a certain unit type, they do all use the same units(dlcs add some unique units to each faction, as well as one or two factions with many different units) although personally this doesn't bother me to much as playing to the factions specialty allows each clan to play differently offering a unique play through each campaign. 

Finally one of the biggest issues in shogun 2 is realm divide, this mechanic happens late in the game when you take enough provinces. This causes the shogun to fear your power and declare you a enemy of the state, the result is diplomacy is thrown out the window, and inevitably all factions will declare war on you, including your allies. This mechanic is not implemented well and can often feel unfair, although mods can change the way realm divide works allowing you to easily keep your allies and friends after realm divide allowing for a much more enjoyable experience.


Some people may feel intimidated by the setting of the game or the flaws that i have outlined, but i can't stress enough that this game is a easily among the top total war games in the series, and in my opinion is vastly superior to it's successor Rome 2. There are ways to deal with most of the games flaws which i have outlined above allowing you to take full advantage of the many great features CA nailed when making this game. 

Weather you are a total war fan that has not purchased shogun 2, or someone who is interested in the franchise or strategy games in general, i can't recommend this game enough.

TL:DR The game is polished and has some of the best diplomacy/battles in the series, multiplayer is fun and addictive while it does have some issues(siege ai/realm divide and a lack of variety) it's in my opinion well worth the price.",1413546924,1703546868,True,3,0,0.532730638980865479,0,True,False,False

out of all the TW games, this one has the best flow of battle IMHO. The pace is good, not too fast but also not too slow, and the differences between the factions are there, but not as heavy as you might fear. That way, it is always somewhat balanced, no matter who you play as. Units either die, or they survive, when hit by arrows and the like, with muskets totally obliterating anyone, but being not so precise, requiring direct line of fire, and reloading much slower than bow and arrow. in vanilla, sea battles are exhausting (as always) whereas in FOTS you finally have somewhat proper sea battles.

If you get even moderately large and successful, everyone will turn on you and every single one of your allies [b]and[/b] vassals will eventually betray you. If you're familiar with Attila, this is like playing as one of the Roman Empires, except that all Shogun campaigns will end this way.
- The AI naval spam is absolutely unbearable in both the base game, and FOTS. Playing whack-a-mole with enemy fleets is incredibly tiresome. Ignoring them isn't an option as they'll either land armies next to your undefended cities, or bombard them (FOTS only).
- The AI agent spam is as bad as it's always been.
- Anti-player bias and awful diplomacy. This isn't news for any seasoned Total War player, but it's particularly bad in this game.

However, there's a significant caveat to this experience that has nothing to do with the game's content itself. 

Despite owning a copy of the game, I've been caught in a quagmire that prevents me from actually playing it, effectively turning my purchase into nothing more than a digital ornament to admire in my library. This dilemma emanates not from my hardware or a lack of trying, but from an external source: Sega's bewildering restrictions and account management issues that act as a barrier hindering access even for legitimate owners. 

The game, in theory, boasts beautifully crafted landscapes, a compelling strategic layer, and robust combat mechanics that should position it as a jewel in the crown of strategy gaming. Players are expected to be challenged by its immersive campaigns, diverse clans, and the sheer thrill of real-time battles. Yet, this theoretical enjoyment is undercut sharply when you are persistently denied the simple right to play what you've paid for.

It's a paradox that the very systems meant to safeguard against piracy have turned against their customer base, creating a needless  struggle to unlock the very content one should readily enjoy. The resulting predicament is a clear case where DRM policies and stringent account verification fail the gamer.

The consequences have been a foreboding reminder that our digital libraries are now always our own. That crucial power - the easy of access to your digital games - remains firmly in the grip of the publisher. For those considering Total War Shogun 2 I might relay my experience as a caution against potential disappointment. You might purchase a game you can't play, a situation no gamer should ever find themselves in. 

Because of this I do not recommend Total War Shogun 2.  It is a situation emblematic of a larger conversation about consumer rights in the digital age. Players are often at the mercy of licensing agreements and DRM policies that can change without notice or reason. The message is clear: Buyer beware. What you ""own"" may not be yours to play, and that's a precedent we ought to challenge.",1702956012,1702956012,False,12,4,0.500327885150909424,1,True,False,False

The battles are massive, the building/management stuff are pretty okay, the economics/finances are pretty good (it gets more and more fragile as you progress through a game, especially in high difficulties), and most importantly the DLCs bring a different but still fun flavour to the original game. Special mention to the FoTS DLC as it totally brought a clash between the traditional melee-bow focused army compositions against the firearm-cannon focused army compositions, depicted as the central theme in the Boshin War. I have only found the tech tree-research aspect of the game rather lackluster, especially with the very small bonuses each research component might bring even into the late-game tech-tree. FoTS also lack more ""individualised/unique"" units to the factions, especially those that could make or break a game (except for the very strong and fairly-early game Choshu unit, the Kihetai, or the Jozai's Yugiketai if not for its' max deployed unit cap).

tl;dr: a very worthwhile game, buy it if it's on a discount (especially bundled packages) or buy them full price since it's not that expensive nowadays (March 2019).

UPDATE (as of 2023, after the latest update removing the chat function and misc. things):

Welp, after years of playing this game, after HUNDREDS of hours of playing this wonderful game... They broke it for me. For some reason, the game kept on crashing out after I select a faction on the campaign menu. It also wouldn't allow me to load into a saved game. There is no music after the intro trailer had played. I've tried all sorts of random possible remedies I found on forums and websites, nothing worked thus far (for others it did, I honestly envy each and every one of them).

It is a travesty, a huge middle finger to anyone who buys Creative Assembly's product. After all of the stupid greedy stuff involving Three Kingdoms and Warhammer 3 I can safely say that Creative Assembly is a TERRIBLE developer that does not care about their customer.

PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME (unless you're lucky and you can actually play this game at all, otherwise... you can always ""try"" it out somewhere on your own time and convenience).

A concise theme that would inspire other games like Britannia and Troy, Shogun is far and above the more solid title even today, graphically the game holds up better that Rome 2 in my opinion, and shaders/texture mods are always an option. Sound design from battle/menu music all the way to the whistle of the arrows coming down on their victims, you could close your eyes during a battle and be forgiven for thinking you were there yourself.

Unlike other titles like Empire or even  Rome 2, no major re-work mods are 'necessary' to make this game feel fresh and enjoyable, thought diplomacy is lacking in depth, something that *did get carried on into later titles.

Ultimately I do hope for a Shogun 3, it's been over 10 years, And I'm sure they could expand the setting to Korea and Northern China.

As a new member of Total War series, I can say that Shogun 2 has stood out to me more so than others in the series for a couple reasons immersive Setting, EPIC BATTLES, great mods, and SEXY SOUNDTRACK! 

             The game takes place in feudal Japan, which is such a bad ass and immersive setting considering the time period(for me maybe not so much for them), because of how warfare and honour were such a huge part of Japanese culture. The maps do the game well and are even pretty good looking for a 2011 game, ESPECIALLY with weather. The campaign map(turn based part of the game) was also surprisingly beautiful looking, even comparing it to Civ 5 I believe it holds up well, maybe even better in some cases.

               The battles in this game were so much fun, which is great because I believe that any total war game needs some grand battles to be a great game. How were these done in Shogun 2? Well all the fighting was matched combat mocap animations, which means all units interact with each other and aren't just mindlessly slashing through each other, it makes battles have a greater depth to them and feel more alive compared to "" Cough ""-- Total War: Warhammer  --"" Cough cough "", but that's forgivable given how many races there are. Sieges are one hell of a time, from climbing the walls all the way to cannon balling the hell out of the walls and archers in the fort.

                Modding in this game just like any other total war game is unreal, the modders are what keep these games going YEARS after their release and I wish there were more ways to thank these people for their work and dedication to these games. Mods can completely change how the game is played, from better realism or even flipped to a more anime style unit set who can crush those who dare challenge them with no thought. I think without mods this game would be lacking a lot of things like unit variety and some smaller things, but thankfully modding is here. 

                 FINALLY the last bit of my rant, the soundtrack of the game, I think it offers a smaller variety of songs/tracks, but let me tell you what it does offer is phenomenal and does the game justice. The battle soundtrack is FUCKING awesome, I love watching my cavalry ram the enemy line in the ass or hunt the archers down, while still  hearing it play in the background like a sweet lullaby congratulating you for your great charge. I believe the music really helps a lot of other things in this game like immersion and the epic battles which might not be as great without it. 

Now this wouldn't be a fair review without the cons 
1.) It's old, no shit so some things are dated or aren't optimized well.
2.) Base game lacks diversity when it comes to units all factions are the same with different colours. (IM FINE WITH IT) 
3.) Some QoL things in the new games weren't invented yet so some task are painful and annoying, but still a blast to do.
4.) Sea battles were meh, but I feel that's more of a ship issue than game issue. 
5.) Performance CAN TANK and most likely will. Fire and dead bodies will make this game run worse than cyberpunk on launch!

                   In conclusion I think Shogun 2 is a fun game buy it now. What're you waiting for? DO IT!

The units are awesome. The battles feel historic. The battles operate similar to Rome 2, which is a massive plus. There's a lot of value in the 3 different campaigns.

That said, it may be THE worst historical Total War title period. it's certainly the worst I've ever played. It cannot be understated how laughable the unit balance is, especially in multiplayer, and how little strategy actually factors into it.

Units die and rout off the field in literal seconds after entering melee combat, and melee combat is more akin to blobs of matter and anti-matter colliding than units actually fighting. Basically as soon as two units touch, one drops dead and the other keeps going. There is no time to lock down a unit in melee and try to get a flank off, because by the time your flanking force is in position the fight has already been over long before and one unit is probably gone from the field.

And when I say gone from the field, I mean OFF THE FIELD. There is no routing away from the fight and then reforming. Units shatter and flee the field entirely after just the first engagement in almost all cases, even if they've only lost 20-30 men in their 120 strong unit. Skaven in Warhammer are braver than the units in this game.

And speaking of Skaven, just like the ratmen and basically half of the other Warhammer factions, in Shogun 2, ranged spam is the name of the game. The lack of shields innately makes ranged spam overpowered, and there's functionally no counter because whatever you try to counter it with will, unsurprisingly, be shot to pieces before it can do so. The ranged doomstacks in Warhammer 2 wish they were as guaranteed to generate wins as those in Shogun 2 are. CA simply doubled down on this in Fall of the Samurai. The DLC basically turns this game into Empire Total War, set in Japan, and that's what the majority of battles are anyway because of how powerful ranged units are.

In multiplayer, the game is functionally pay to win. If you do not have access to the DLC units, you WILL lose. The units added by the DLC are objectively better than the base game units in every way. Unfortunately, multiplayer is also this game's main draw unlike most other Total Wars, as this is the only Total War game with an approximation of an entirely player made faction. This is the only part of this review that might come off as CA hate, but given this is the only game that has such a highly requested feature which has never made a return, making the DLC units so overpowered to entice people to buy them and stay relevant was almost certainly intentional.

I have well over a thousand hours in Total War games at this point, both on and off Steam and both historical and fantasy. Shogun 2 claims to be historical, but seems to be the original one shoving unnecessarily fantastical elements in, and as a result it dilutes itself into a disappointment.

There is barely any strategy to battles, you just rely on your units being innately better like in later titles and if your don't have the objectively better units, you have nothing, you can't use superior numbers, because the units die so easily it's like wheat being cut down such that a 60 man cavalry unit can face 200 yari cavalry AND the General's bodyguard all at once and WIN, simply from being from DLC.

There is nothing to be done to counter higher tier units, especially those locked behind DLC, because the counters to those units are in the DLC. And the campaign is simply not the main draw of this game. It's your typical historical Total War with silly diplomacy and stupid AI.

I tried to give this game a fair chance with how many hours I put in, both in campaign and in multiplayer, and both are just laughably disappointing because everything about it is so disappointing, the battles most of all.

Pros:
+ Sequel to Shogun Total War
+ We're back to Japan!
+ Mods to make it easier
+ Christianity is now good!

Cons
- Realm Divide
- Crashes often (Mod issues)
- DLC Heroes and additional units costs money :(
- Otomo, Ikki, and Hattori costs money :(
- AI cheats with Metsuke and Monks/Missionaries

(This review is done on Very Hard difficulty, unless otherwise stated)

So far, I'm playing Shogun 2 with easy mode mods because I don't like my units to ""rout because everyone is routing"" or ""Army Destroyed like Okehazama.""

The game is fine, it's even better with mods, such as expanded Japan, +Korea, Additional Units, Realm Divide Fix Mods, GodTierUnits, and Noagent/ShipsAI mod. 

Those who played Shogun 1, Medieval Total Wars (Both 1 and 2) are for a nasty surprise. This game is hard. 
Especially when Realm Divide Kicks in.

Why so? Realm Divide is supposed to mimic the ""Anti-Nobunaga Alliance"" so I heard, and the game overdoes it. Here's how.

- The AI is given extra Unit power to take you down.
- The AI says ""SCREW YOU"" to any alliance and relations to you, even if you are very friendly to them from the start.
- You can't mimic the Oda-Tokugawa Alliance ingame, without using another player on a PvE game.

I use a Realm Divide mod to cap the relation penalty (It's more harsher in a harder difficulty tbh), and it makes a scenario where I can make ""Tozama"" and ""Fudai"" Daimyos.

The AI loves spamming their Rank 1 Metsukes or somehow Max Rank Metsukes on your agents and army. This is why I also use a no AI agents mod- Which is a lifesavor because the AI is LOVES to spam Metsukes and they often get lucky and either remove my other agents minding their own business, or turn my army to their side. The only thing the mod needs is to limit the AI from building Metsuke buildings all over Japan...

One bad thing about the game is Ship Combat. It's slow, and using Automatic Resolve is NOT GOOD. Fighting one ship with a fleet? Somehow that dinky Bow Kobaya can heavily damage your O Ataka Bune. Or even sunk it. I am not kidding. Sure, you can manually battle them, but against another player? Hope that player has the patience to battle in the sea. Oh and the AI LOVES to attack your shipping lanes, and unless you can redirect your shipping lanes to a closer effient port, expect money issues from the trade penalty and wasting money on a fleet to protect your trade lines AND your trade nodes. Yes, there are trade nodes. You need them to make certain buildings.

Speaking of Multiplayer, unlike Shogun 1, this game has PvP, and Co-op Campaigns (Not sure with the other Total War games). The only issue is if one player does not have the DLC for certain clans and units, it won't appear for the player who has it. Ex. You have the Hero Unit DLC, and the other player doesn't they won't appear in your Multiplayer Campaign.

Otherwise, even with these flaws, the game is ok, despite its difficulty.

Rating 7/10 - Or a Nobunaga out of ten.",1407250869,1699015443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Total War: Shogun 2"" is a jewel in the crown of strategy games, blending unparalleled depth with a heart-rending atmosphere. The elegance of ancient Japan comes alive through the breathtaking graphics and meticulous recreation of historical elements. Each battle is a throbbing experience that tests both nerves and strategic prowess.

The balance between economy, diplomacy, and military expansion is masterfully executed. The challenges are demanding, yet fair, and the joy of a hard-fought victory is unsurpassed. The AI is intelligent, posing challenges to even seasoned strategists, while the various clans provide enough variety to keep the replay value high.

The epic music and authentic sound effects contribute to the immersion, making each campaign an unforgettable experience. The historical depth and lovingly designed campaign map transport players back to a time when honor and tactics decided the fate of nations.

Unlike its successors, such as ""Total War: Rome 2"" and ""Total War: Attila"", ""Shogun 2"" retains a clear and intuitive user interface that never overwhelms, but encourages the player to explore the complexity of the game. The successors tend to overcomplicate the core mechanics, losing the clear and focused approach of ""Shogun 2"".

While the newer titles in the series have their own charm and improvements, many fans miss the clear vision and polished execution of ""Shogun 2"". The successors often failed to maintain the fine balance between accessibility and depth that made ""Shogun 2"" a milestone in the ""Total War"" series.

""Total War: Shogun 2"" is more than just a game; it's an ode to the art of warfare and an unforgettable dive into the fascinating history of Japan.

Things I Like: 
- It's Japan. It's got sword-using Samurai. It's got cannons and rifles. Reminds me of The Last Samurai movie.
- Weather effects. 
- The controls for commanding troops are really useful
- You can eventually make your own faction, breaking off from the Shogunate, for example, and trying to take Japan by yourself without a team victory!
- Music and sound are great and on point. 
- It still has those crappy TW in-game videos that we all love, to show a change or progress in time. 
- The graphics are the best of the classic TW titles
- Mods are great, almost to an essential point
- Ships can actually aid ground battles if they're coastal by attacking the towns. 

Things I Don't Like: 
- What this company has become and resorted to. 
- The time limit to complete the main objective is not mandatory. It doesn't tell you this. 
- Achievements for multiplayer even though it's quite dead now. 
- It's beginning to age. Not as harshly as Rome 1 and Medievil 2 (the ones I grew up playing). I guess I just dislike ageing in general haha

I spent countless hours messing around in battles, listening to heroic speeches (and cheating at the game because I was 11 and didn't quite get the campaign).

I was pumped beyond belief when I heard Rome II got announced and bought it immediately (in my Freshman year of college, boy how time flies) only to not be able to play it because of how broken it was on launch.  But it got fixed and countless more hours were spent and finally some campaigns beaten.

CA got everything right with this one.

Plus all the Dlcs and the expansion Fall of Samurai.

Great game, shows how much CA had for the love of their work.

I recommend this game for Real time strategy gamers, or anyone who plays chess, go, or shogi, or card games like poker or tactical card games.

The Good:
+The music, visuals, voice acting, and even flavor text all exude a wonderful samurai aesthetic.
+The gameplay is a great mix of turn-based provincial management and real-time battles.
+All the units counter each other and battles feel extremely rewarding.

The Bad:
-The different playable clans feel samey.
-The most unique clans are locked behind microtransactions.
-Naval battles leave a lot to be desired.

I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of the samurai era. Though there are many areas that is lacking in this game due to how old it is now, for example diplomacy is pretty poor, AIs goal is to destroy the player so in that sense it is not immersive, as they will reject a lot of reasonable offers from you. It is impossible to have a long standing ally or vassal be on your side due to the negative effect of territorial expansion as well as realm divide, once you have reach a certain size and capture Tokyo which will declare you as the Shogunate, every faction in the game will be your enemy.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Total War: SHOGUN 2, the game where I set out to conquer feudal Japan with epic battles and cunning strategy, but ended up realizing I'm better at making samurai irrationally furious (after 90 hours of katana-clashing chaos).

Pros:

- I've mastered the art of bait and switch. Drawing the enemy into a forest ambush or luring them onto a bridge only to set it on fire feels like a mischievous game of tactics.
- The game's historical setting is like a deep dive into the world of samurai and shoguns. It's as if I've been transported back to ancient Japan, and I've probably watched enough Akira Kurosawa films to earn an honorary black belt.
- I've learned that diplomacy is for the weak. Who needs alliances when you can just build an army of ronin and declare war on everyone? I've made so many enemies; it's like a dating app gone horribly wrong.

Cons:

- My samurai deserve an award for most creatively frustrated death cries. Charging headfirst into enemy lines or getting skewered by a lone archer seems to be their favorite pastime.
- I've developed a fear of monks with flaming staffs. They're like one-man infernos, and they've torched my best warriors more times than I care to admit.
- The game's politics are like a soap opera on the battlefield. Betrayals, marriages, and epic feuds are as common as cherry blossoms in spring.

Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a game that invites you to become a master tactician but lets you revel in the chaos of samurai warfare. It's the kind of game where you'll start with dreams of forging an empire and end up laughing at the relentless misadventures of your clan.

To those contemplating a journey to feudal Japan: Embrace the strategy, accept that your samurai will make you facepalm, and remember that in Total War: SHOGUN 2, it's not about the perfect campaign; it's about the epic stories that unfold on the battlefield.

In conclusion, Total War: SHOGUN 2 is where I've realized that when life gives you samurai, castles, and betrayals, you lead, you clash, and you laugh at the chaos of feudal Japan.

AKA the last good one before *Everything* went to shit.

(You can make the argument that Empire was the mask off moment, but you could also make an argument that the games after Rome 1 were already chipping away at what made Total War Total War. e.g. the cavalry charges in Medieval 2 were already worse than the ones in Rome 1.)

Or the last good/decent Total War game before CA decided to ditch it's old audience (that are the entire reason they have/had, depending on when the person started at CA, jobs and a company, then and now, to begin with; the lack of respect for their players, AND TOTAL WAR ITSELF, is palpable) in favor of a far less demanding/expectant and broader one.

Shogun 2's developers managed to salvage Shogun 2 into a half decent Total War game, despite the engine limitations and waning Total War design philosophy. Unfortunately, it seems Shogun 2 is the best CA could possibly ever do with the current Total War engine and design philosophy/target audience in mind.

It's also the only total war with a fleshed out multiplayer, and that multiplayer was probably my favourite part of the game. Which is the main reason why I am making this review negative. (I also have some things to say about single player if thats all you care about.)

CA recently put out an ""update"" in which they removed the ingame chat feature. This makes playing with randoms in custom lobbies so unfun, since you can't discuss rules or make map suggestions to the server host. Other aspects of the multiplayer have been broken for a long time too, like player statistics, leader boards, and clans. CA has completely killed the multiplayer community for no apparent reason which is kinda sad.

The recent ""update"" also broke a few things in single player too, like the preview map colours and the ingame encyclopedia. You wouldn't notice the map colours being broken if you've never played the game before, but the encyclopedia was an extremely helpful tool for learning the game and keeping track of things like unit stats and building chains. 

All in all I really want to say, ""yes, buy this game!"" because like I said at the start, I absolutely love it, but CA don't.

[h2]Rating: ★★★★★[/h2]

Playing Shogun 2 is like orchestrating a grand samurai opera where the stage is feudal Japan, and the actors are armed to the teeth. It's a strategic masterpiece with a soundtrack of clashing katanas and war drums.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Beautifully Crafted Setting:[/b] Feudal Japan comes to life in stunning detail. The cherry blossoms might distract you from the impending war, but the picturesque landscapes make each campaign a visual delight.

2. [b]Strategic Depth:[/b] The game's strategic depth is like a bowl of ramen - rich, satisfying, and requires careful consideration. The balance between military might, diplomacy, and economy is finely tuned.

3. [b]Engaging Battles:[/b] The battles are a spectacle of disciplined samurai clashes and cunning tactics. Watching your carefully crafted army decimate the enemy with a well-executed strategy is immensely satisfying.

4. [b]Diplomacy with a Katana:[/b] Diplomacy is not just about treaties; it's about forging alliances and betraying unsuspecting clans. The political maneuvering adds layers of complexity to the game.

5. [b]Cinematic Duels:[/b] The cinematic duels between generals are like intense tea ceremonies, only with deadly consequences. Each clash feels personal and adds a touch of drama to the overall narrative.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Learning Curve:[/b] The learning curve is like mastering the art of the tea ceremony - it takes time and patience. New players might find themselves overwhelmed by the intricate mechanics.

2. [b]Occasional AI Oddities:[/b] The AI, while generally competent, can sometimes make questionable decisions. Witnessing an enemy army perform a questionable dance routine rather than a tactical maneuver is both amusing and frustrating.

3. [b]Siege Battles Can Drag:[/b] Siege battles, while epic in scale, can sometimes feel like waiting for your rice to cook. The slow pace might test the patience of even the most seasoned warlords.

4. [b]Limited Unit Variety:[/b] The unit variety, while fitting for the historical context, might feel a bit limiting compared to other titles in the Total War series.

5. [b]Occasional Pathfinding Issues:[/b] The pathfinding of units can be like leading a group of geese - they might not always take the most efficient route. It's a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of warfare.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Shogun 2: Total War is a masterclass in strategy, blending historical accuracy with engaging gameplay. Whether you're orchestrating political alliances or leading your army into the heart of battle, the game offers a captivating experience in feudal Japan.",1696263464,1696330189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sieges are okay, but are so easy to go around that the player has no reason to fight one. The only upside is that the AI is actually dangerous on the attack. On land battle, the AI vary from decent to brain dead. Sometime they will trie to actually hit you where it hurts, some others tehy will send their cavalry into a Yari Wall and get slaughtered. Unit wise you can easily trash an army full samurai with nothing but peasants, making 90% of the roster pointless.

PREVIOUS REVIEW: Shogun II, as the sequel to the first ever Total War, is like a love-letter to the series. It takes everything players love and implements them almost perfectly. The campaign mechanics, battle mechanics, visual design, sound design, all of it. Shogun II offers three unique expansions set in Japan (only one is included in the base game), ranging from ancient spears and bows to modern rifles and ironclads. Multiplayer lobbies allow you to mix all three expansions together for a remarkably balanced experience, and, unlike any other Total War, allows you to easily port custom battle maps using a super intuitive map creator! Also includes an optional progression system for multiplayer that lets you rank up your general and units, which is really cool.",1572550185,1693962344,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Play to the strength of your clan. Recruit cheaper and better Katana units as the Shimazu or No-Dachi units as the Date.
Samurai get special heavy armor the Ashigaru never gets and their arrows penetrate more easily. Ashigaru arrows have trouble piercing that armor.
Pay attention to garrison troops you automatically get when your provincial walls get attacked. They are completely expendable in all cases and eat up losses your vets would take in their stead. You build up the forts to get more troops, recruitment slots, replenishment, and archer towers that automatically fire on the enemy, and that eats up one more food for each upgrade. These don't get a bonus from your clan.
Try to have two cavalry units attack an isolated enemy that is NEVER EVER a Yari spear unit and have the one facing their back at full charge for heavy damage and immediately have them disengage to cut losses. That charge is used up and you are only going to lose troops by having them melee. When that enemy is chasing those horses, have your other cavalry charge for full damage in their back and repeat.
Places with trade routes you take over give you lots of money if you can build multiple trade ships for them. Ten is the most per trading spot, but each one gives lesser returns. I wouldn't really bother with the fancy ships and stick to the smalls and medium ships to absorb enemy navies.
Building up provinces with upgraded buildings that eat food are newbie traps. Food determines growth for each province, per turn, and you should only construct foodie buildings (upgraded) when you have Metsuke (build markets) who can settle and increase income. It is smart to have five of your richest provinces have all of the hungry buildings with five experienced Metsuke with the income growth skills to settle them for the rest of the game. It is a dumb mechanic, since those buildings make lots of money and eat your food, while your excess food provide the same growth when you get one or ten provinces. If you take a province that eats up more food than what you are storing, you will starve your clan.

The mod manager is continuously broken with recent patches, with CA going so far as to update the older versions of the game to make it even harder to roll back the version of the game on Steam just to make it functional for replay value. Where are the patches for the mechanics of the game itself?

Creative Assembly has updated nearly every game released after Medieval 2, and caused huge issues for the mod managers and previously up-to-date mods in the process. Thankfully they didn't have good documentation or understanding of the Rome 1 and Medieval 2 engine and code, or else those would have been messed with too. 

CA still profits from these older titles, and they are not invested in dedicated servers. Shameful display!",1692992239,1692992958,False,63,2,0.817615270614624023,0,True,False,False

My only issue with it is it's Realm Divide mechanic. Basically, it's designed so that, once you reach a certain power status during your campaign, all other clans will unite to take you down. It tries to solve a classic problem that many strategy games have: boring and unchallenging mid-to-late games. Its a good idea, but its very poorly implemented. There is no transition period; all of your allies and even vassals will turn against you immediately unless their power level is ridiculously low after you taking 1 more province. There's no build-up to this moment; no warnings, no events, no nothing. It simply fills up a bar with your reputation to tell you how many provinces you can capture before triggering it. So it ends up forcing you to turtle once you're 1 province away from Realm Divide being triggered. But worst of all, once it triggers, you'll be facing endless waves of doomstacks coming at you from the other side of Japan. Seems cool, until you get tired and start save scumming to end it faster. Ultimately, it fails to fix the issue; from being bored of being unchallenged, your mid-to-late campaigns will be boring for being forcefully designed to be hard without much substance or nuances to it, taking away many things which were build during your playthrough (e.g. allies).

Overall, this is a very polished game. I would recommend this to anyone that likes games such as Civilization/Paradox Games or 4X. It has a great mix of strategy game design mechanics, and despite it's Realm Divide/mid-to-late campaigns not being satisfying, it's still a game worth trying.",1652917223,1692446337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jesus, Angry Joe's old review from back in the day. I did know it was a strategy game and I love strategy games, along with this period in history. The Sengoku Jidai just captures my interest like no other period in history can. And Shogun 2, while obviously being far from historically accurate (looking at the Hattori), it captures the spirit and the feeling of the period to a T, matched only, arguably, by Nobunaga's Ambition. 

This is also Total War at its finest. Unit variety is a bit lacking to be sure, but with each advantage in how each clan plays, you'll not be left wanting for replay playthroughs. Just as an example, you'll certainly not approach your Oda playthrough the same way as you would approach the Otomo or Takeda. The DLC, while not perfect, is certainly far more fair compared to the likes of  Warhammer or 3Ks, which hurts me because I quite enjoy 3Ks.

Sure, the scope and setting are rather small, there isn't much cultural variety, and there are some bugs here and there, but it really polished a lot of the mechanics and ideas from earlier titles.

In May, multiplayer chat was removed and the mod manager was broken.  The latter was particularly bad, as not only could people no longer activate mods on launch, any mods active before the update would now be permanently active, meaning you could not turn them off either. You could avoid these by rolling back to the previous version, but as of the June update that is no longer possible. The community found a workaround that involved editing the game files to remove most of the update, which allowed us to play the game for a little longer. 
The supposed performances increases are in fact quite the opposite, my 3080 is struggling to go past 25 fps when it used to run double that on the same game same time last year.  
But the cherry on top has to be yesterday s update. CA added their own mod manager! Which doesnt work! And conflicts with the old one, so you cant run both at the same time meaning neither woks now. And you still cant uninstall mods. Which dont work because they are no longer compatible the current build. Given some of the changes to the game files, it looks like it could no longer be possible to edit both battle and campaign maps, meaning those mods could no longer be restored. Even if you want to play vanilla, the campaign now crashes on start. To top it all off, sound doesnt work past the intro cinematics. 
Given that every recent update  has been worse than the last I assume malicious intent, sabotaging older, better games to push new ones. Or spectacular incompetence due to awful hiring practices and working conditions at the company. Either way it s a great shame to see one of the greatest strategy games of all time be murdered in the darkness of automatic game updates.
Edit : Got the game to work, both modded and unmodded with some rudimentary game file edits. Performance still sucks thought. Worth playing, get it on sale, not worth giving full price to CA.",1689358123,1690628006,False,8,0,0.59056168794631958,2,True,False,False

34330,2283542,76561198005133574,0,20,191535,0,36506,1696434715,"*Edit* Looks like things are working again, and there even are some small improvements from the patch.  I wish there was more transparency from CA as that was an ugly transition period of two months and there are still some reported bugs (mostly related to mod manager, as many mods are technically out of date now but the handful I use are working fine despite the out of date tag) but looks like things ended up in a good place after the community panicked for a while, and understandably so.  I can recommend this game once again now, although there are still some doubts towards the rest of the franchise atm.

One of the best entries in the Total War series Shogun 2 marked CA's return to their first, humble title in the flagship franchise that defined the grand strategy/rts hybrid genre.  Depending on whom you ask Shogun 2 is not only one of the best of the series, it's the last great entry in TW.  While that's not entirely fair as the games that followed have sometimes met with huge commercial success, many hardcore TW fans mark Shogun 2 as the pinnacle of the TW series as every subsequent title has been marred in one way or another by title specific problems.

This makes Shogun 2 one of the best entry points for players new to the TW franchise.  Shogun 2 has enough sophistication and depth to entertain for numerous campaign playthroughs, without being too overwhelming (relative to later titles that added more and more elements to gameplay that can impact play from turn 1).  The smaller but well balanced unit roster contributes significantly to this.  Shogun 2 may be the only TW game where turn 1 early game units can remain viable and useful all the way to endgame, but are not so overpowered to make late game and elite units irrelevant.

Shogun 2 is also one of the most beautiful titles in the TW series despite it's age.  While in some regards the varying visual styles of TW games are a subjective taste thing, most still acknowledge Shogun 2's beauty: the unit models and animations are fantastic even by today's standards; the environments pretty, alive and convincing while remaining functional (mostly, with only small scattered spots of terrain collision issues); and the effects (arrows, matchlock and cannon fire, fires, etc.) among the best if not the pinnacle of the series.

That said, the game is not without flaws.  While Rome 2 got all the attention for a badly rushed launch and numerous bugs (a fair number which still exist today despite the patching), Shogun 2 also had a fairly sizeable number of them that remain today.  Most  are fairly minor or can be avoided (if you're aware of them) but a few can be painful and naval combat in particular is prone to them.  Many players avoid naval combat altogether due to its messy and tedious nature.  While many of the land units are well balanced and fun to play with, the siege units are not and generally shouldn't be used or trained at all with rare exceptions.  Diplomacy, while not exactly buggy, can be difficult to figure out and generally is used minimally (it is total war after all, you can only play nice for so long).  Finally, there is a steep difficulty curve as you crank up the campaign difficulty, and some clans can be tricky to manage particularly in the early game.  The endgame Realm Divide mechanic can be a doozy to players the first few times around until you come to understand and anticipate it.

I also have to mention that the game is not optimized for multi-core CPUs (not surprising given its age), so some newer pcs may have difficulty running the game.  Mine runs it fine, but if your multi-core has particularly weak individual cores you may struggle to run it.

These downsides aside the game more than makes up for it in what it does well: some of the best balanced, vibrant and entertaining combat in all of TW.  Shogun 2 handles the core parts of TW gameplay better than just about any title and it does so in an attractive package.  I strongly recommend it to new players and TW vets alike.


No DLC is considered essential for this game (some would say the Blood pack, I never bothered as blood splatter and dismemberment aren't needed to enjoy the excellent animations in the stock game's visceral combat).  The Sengoku Jidai Unit pack is the closest to essential adding some flavor and fun unique units to the game, but doesn't ultimately change gameplay.  The 3 clan packs are all worth the expense if you want to play a different type of faction as they vary from the other clans (Ikko-Ikki > Otomo > Hattori for varied, unique gameplay).  Fall of the Samurai is an excellent stand-alone expansion, practically an entirely new game with new mechanics set several centuries later.  Rise of the Samurai is neither stand-alone nor all that interesting, but it is a revamped campaign in an earlier time period for those seeking something new and different.  The remaining dlcs are of much lesser value and can generally be ignored.",1314336222,1689866307,True,1,0,0.502262473106384277,0,True,False,False

At the end of the Ashikaga Shogunate, the turbulent era called Sengoku Jidai(the Warring States Period), players become a daimyo and fight to be a new Shogun who dominates Japan.

I love this game because each daimyo has its own characteristics. You can play a variety of games using various daimyos, from a daimyo specializing in a bow, spear, and katana to a daimyo specializing in shooting guns and cannons.

Also, depending on the player's ability and discretion, the outcome of a battle changes every time. Change the military power influence by using various weathers and terrains to your advantage. These are the biggest advantages of the Total War: SHOGUN 2. You can also come from behind to win like Oda Nobunaga at the  Battle of Okehazama!

Furthermore, the in-game graphic descriptions of Japanese-style castles, architecture, and natural environment are excellent, and the battle scene is so realistic, so it's fun to watch.

Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a game that even gamers who don't play Total War series should play at least once in their lives. It will be a great experience! I highly recommend this game.

It's really hard to beat its simple and straightforward mechanics that lend to the games replayability after all these years. 
Highly recommend for anyone who hasn't tried it yet, also a great introduction into the series if you've never played a Total War game. (Although I would recommend Rome Total War or Medieval 2 as a first game over this one) 

PROS  

- Graphics that still hold up very nicely to this day. Beautiful colour palletes and overall map and unit designs as well as artwork

- Full scale battles can feel intense as they can be fast paced and require quick thinking and strategical movement

- Lots of factions to choose from that each have their own pros and cons as well as difficulties to change up the play style from Clan to Clan (unique units, starting positions, buffs and debuffs that are Clan specific)

- Naval battles which are a welcome addition 

- Lack of an extensive unit variety leads to more strategic thinking and army planning as instead of brute forcing overpowered units, you win through cunning and thought out plans especially against more difficult AI

- Co-op Head to Head campaign takes the game to a whole new level in terms of enjoyment and planning

- Fleshed out technology trees that greatly enhance your Clan anywhere from economy, social and political, and military buffs

- One of the best DLCs that has ever come out for any Total War game in the franchise that serves as its own standalone game


CONS

- As it is set in Feudal Japan and as I mentioned in the PROS section, there is a lack of unit variety even with the inclusion of Clan specific units that are unique. Easily mitigated by mods but for those who want a vanilla experience, you may find that unit progression is lacking. Also more fleshed out in its DLC but still suffers from somewhat lack of real unit variety.

- Although naval battles are a welcome addition, in the base game they can feel like a slog fest. Also naval battles are much more RNG based than a land battle as Naval moral is finicky and usually whoever has the larger fleet usually wins due to the inherent mechanics of Vanilla naval battles. The DLC naval battles are much more fleshed out but they still suffer from an emphasis on RNG

- Siege battles, which are a large component of the game can become very repetitive. The attacker is always left at a huge disadvantage (which makes complete sense) but steam rolling settlements that are even moderately defended is not easy and you can expect to take huge losses unless you are fighting every single battle which is time consuming. Even then you will suffer heavy causalities unless you force the defender to sally forth. Defending in a siege is generally extremely easy as missile units become overpowered due to the design and mechanics of siege defenses. It's easy to hold cities, it's a lot harder to capture them. 

- Whether or not this is a CON is for the reader to judge. Inherently it is so I included it in this section. Generals, which are the leaders of your army and provide buffs to your units and debuffs to the enemies are very easily killed. They do not have anything that makes them more powerful than a regular fielded unit. The only thing marking them as the general is their banner and their unique unit which is a Bodyguard unit. Personally I like the vulnerability in this aspect. It makes investing in a general feel more weighty and really forces you to micromanage which I believe is a fun aspect of the game. 

- Although a very straightforward game in nature, it can have a steep learning curve which can be intimidating. Personally I enjoy that aspect about Shogun 2

Worse still, I've seen posts online (though haven't personally experienced it) that some people now have issues with vanilla features after the update, including regular units and techs suddenly being inaccessible in vanilla. This isn't the first time CA has done this, so be ready for it to get a lot worse in the future if their mediocre new titles don't make money (which they won't). If you really want this game and don't want to wear an eyepatch to get it, be sure to only give this ""wonderful"" company pennies for it on sale and be certain that there is still a community-made workaround to enable mods that works at the time of your purchase.

Unfortunately as of the 24th of May the games modding has been broken and chat removed. This is in line with Creative Assemblies continual raping and disembowling of old total war games. The chat features removal has made multiplayer much much MUCH less fun. One of the last games where chat is unfiltered and hilarious has been removed.
And modding been broken has killed one of the last things that kept this 12 year old game fresh and fun. The last time total war released a fantastic game was Shogun 2 and now they've even ruined that legacy with this.

Truly the best Total War ever. Gameplaywise.

- There are historical characters here, however you will start the campaign playing as their fathers, and the real sengoku heroes will be born (spawn) later.

- Yes the campaign is missing some older features, but the most important things are there and the armies are still nicely manageable here. Only you cannot recruit generals directly. You either wait for some noble to come of age or you have to make one yourself by wining a tough battle. The battles are fast paced, yet realistic (appart from the wall climbing... I don't know what was CA thinking there...)- Every clash of two wapons of any type is nicely synched and animated, as well as every kill, but it does not slows the game down or messes up the ballance at all. The battle maps look nice, only sieges look boring. since the cities and castles are only walls, with no buildings, streets and such. The AI is much, much smarter than in Empire or Napoleon.

-  Naval battles are a mixed bag. When they work they are fun, there's an emphasis on boarding here unlike in previous games, but sometimes they are a pain to do. The AI is really stupid here. It won't do exactly what you want it to do and sometimes two of your ships will ram into each other and block their way for no reason.

For the record, I have played total war games for over 5 years, own almost all of them and have beaten almost all of them (war hammer excepted) this was my last game to do, I played several campaigns on normal difficulty.

The game has excellent combat, diplomacy, factions, buildings and tech tree. However, due to most places only having one or two recruiting slots, and having most good units take 2 turns to train, it demands that the game is played in a very slow pace. 

However, the demand of 25 provinces in 125 turns makes one rush, this however, is not the worst, the worst is that while the game is finely crafted strategy up until realm divide, it is miserable afterward as every single faction attacks you relentlessly. This ends all trade and diplomatic strategy, and turns it into a constant slog fest where you are still required to take 8 or so provinces.

Their ability to completely bust their older titles is simply unmatched. Firstly, the move to remove all chat abilities from the game was a masterstroke of genius. A ""minor technical update"" indeed, it didn't affect my ability to play whatsoever. Who needs to be able to talk to one another in a multiplayer game? Finding buddies to play with and organizing groups in a lobby is overrated.

But it's recently been topped off by their new Mona Lisa: Silently removing the mod manager. Shogun 2 is such a masterpiece that downloading mods of which fixed broken sounds, performance stutters, AI mishaps, and compatibility with newer hardware is completely unnecessary. Awesome stuff! Oh, and I hope you were satisfied with the mods that were already downloaded because now you're stuck with them for the rest of your Shogun 2 career because there's no way to remove or configure them and Steam will automatically reinstall them as part of Steam Cloud.

CA's response to this? Ever so gracefully hidden away in the Steam comments of a thread pointing out the above defecation. They mention that an update will soon be on the way, but we already know what kind of ""improvements"" are included in those. And as such, I am correct in predicting they'll improve this classic even further!

For a short period of time, there was a workaround for those unsatisfied with the removal of mods or chatrooms (the audacity of these folks, boggling) that involved swapping the Steam beta build from the main build (CA's masterpiece, stripped to the nude core) and the pre-2022 linux build (brilliantly named to prevent non-curious Windows users from swapping over). This fixed new performance issues introduced in the main build and allowed the continuous use of the mod manager. Pretty handy stuff.

Remember that proposed patch that CA was going to give us? The one hidden in a thread on Steam somewhere? Well, it arrived. A question that may arise is ""Did they fix the problem?"" And that is a fair question, but CA entirely forgot to define what the ""problem"" was in the first place. The problem being that people used a workaround to get the mod manager and stability back into their game. And thus, they patched in a way to break the workaround builds. as well as the main build.

On top of this, the devs even saw fit to remove ""Workshop Support"" from the Steam store page right at a major Steam sale and after they ""fixed"" all the ""problems"" that made Shogun 2 great, and left it in a truly ""realized"" state.

All joking aside, CA's tomfoolery, trolling, and otherwise degenerate malicious updates to their older titles to discourage their use and to promote the new fecal matter that they keep spewing out is intolerable. Top unprofessional-ism from the U.K.'s largest video game developer was unexpected, but unsurprising. I would suggest steering clear of anything they release, as Shogun 2 isn't their only victim. Empire, Napoleon, and Rome 2 are also being hit by these insane deployments and the company itself either doesn't say anything about it and sneakily updates them or brazenly announces that they are doing it with some snarky Steam forum post and go ""woe is me, buy my new stuff and all the DLCs"" when they're called out on it.

TWS2 is a masterpiece of a game, one of **THE BEST** CA ever made, in terms of atmosphere, the way battles go, mechanic, and thanks to modding community, there is none other strategy game as good as this one. Each battle feels important, and you can see each soldier fighting for their own life, fighting their battles, its not plain ""AI#21992 swings sword at AI#02932 dealing 15 damage"", each soldier is fighting in a hand-to-hand, one of them is going to emerge victorious, a fight between a freshmeat peasant and a battle-hardened samurai is determined by many factors like: fatigue of the warriors, their skill, their weapons, the weapons of their enemy, the terrain. All of this combined makes a very immersive and enjoyable game.
Now cons:
1. Undeveloped AI both in battles and on world map politics. In a battle it doesnt matter what size the bots army is, they WILL attack head-on, using the same basic strategy ""archers in front, footmen behind at the ready"", if the bot is defending it will immediately run to the nearest highground (as you should), make a ""basic strategy"" formation and just wait for you to come and attack.
2. Unit Controls. This ones the most annoying during 50/50 battles, because a single elite unit being confused as to how to get to the place i pointed at can be very crucial to your entire battle.
3. Multiplayer. My most painful problem with it is de-sync when you play for a long time, or black loading screen for either host or the player when loading into a battle, very annoying and we all know CA couldve done better, but they kinda dropped it.

But enough for bad things, the game is really good, it feels satisfying to play it even with these bugs and problems and undeveloped AI. TWS2 is not just good, its a great piece of art that still needs improvement, thankfully there are mods that make your gameplay experience better, but its not enough, unfortunately, we need an official bug fixing patch.

Dozens of times I've stopped playing this game, returned wondering why I quit in the first place, only to get frustrated and quit again.

I never could quite put my finger on why I always ended up hating it and coming back. Now I've finally decided to put my frustration to text.


Shogun 2 is a beautiful-[b]looking[/b] game. It has nice graphics, with a UI and artstyle that nicely captures the game's theme of feudal Japan. The game is full of [b]promise[/b]; different playstyles, different strategies, massive tech trees with elaborate benefits and unique buildings, etc.

The early-game experience in Shogun 2 tends to be quite fun, however as one progresses through the campaign its flaws rapidly become apparent:

1. On the lower difficulties, the game is an absolute cakewalk. After capturing a handful of provinces your economy will start to boom and you'll finish even the Domination campaign (basically capturing all of Japan) with ashigaru armies, long before any of the more interesting technologies get unlocked.

One could artifically lengthen the campaign by simply refusing to expand, however there is no point to this other than sentimental value. I have never, in all my 300+ hours of Shogun 2, built a unique building or a hero unit. I don't think I've ever leveled a general or agent to max level either. 

2. In search of the full game experience, one will probably be tempted, as I was, to try the harder difficulties. This is where the real ""fun"" starts.

Shogun 2 attempts to make the game more difficult by boosting the AI and instilling it with ever more ""anti-player"" fervor. The already god awful diplomacy system breaks down completely on higher difficulties. 

AI factions will declare war on you under the most illogical of circumstances. Factions will send armies from across the map, leaving their homeland completely undefended, in an attempt at throwing more bodies at the player. They will break alliances and backstab you for no reason, for no advantage (other than making life difficult for the player) and no apparent penalty (whereas the player would receive large negative relation penalties for such behavior). 

Even when another AI faction threatens to dominate all of Japan, the other factions won't care and continue to barrel down on the player.

3. On higher difficulties the game devolves into a game of never-ending whack-a-mole. Since the AI is as god awful as the diplomacy system, it still generally fails to provide a challenge. With the massive economic and military boosts the AI gets, even AI factions with a single province will happily send stack after stack into your heavily defended positions, and it will not care.

Unfortunately, while these battles are generally easily won, the auto-resolve function does not agree. It barely seems to recognize any defensive advantage like when you are defending a castle or a river crossing. Thus, nearly every battle has to be fought manually. After one or two such battles, this becomes extremely tedious. 

There is no chance of playing a diplomatic or more slow, peaceful game, bringing me to my next point;

4. The only real threat is being swamped by countless AI stacks before you have the chance to reach ""critical mass."" On higher difficulties this ""critical mass"" is slightly bigger than on the lower ones, but not by much. 

Once it's reached, the game becomes trivial again and the campaign is essentially over. Because strategy, peace and diplomacy are not feasible options in this game, the goal is to reach critical mass as fast as possible. Any attempts at slowing down would result in you going to war with half the map, and having to manually fight off several AI stacks per turn.

As a result, campaigns on the harder difficulties tend to be only [i]slightly[/i] longer than on lower difficulty, [b]once again not allowing you to experience the more interesting features of the game.[/b]


This is Shogun 2 in a nutshell. A game that promises much, initially entrances the player, but ultimately fails to deliver satisfaction.

I'm sure that, in time, I will once again fall into the trap, and will once again quit the game unsatisfied. If you haven't bought this game yet, don't make the same mistake.

While Shogun 2 is a much robust and evolved version of the first title, there are a couple of areas which I feel it was not able to replicate. There was a certain charm to move armies in the map of Shogun like chess pieces on its original Map that I felt Shogun 2 lacks in favor of the fully 3D map. The second area could be the battle AI and the formation mechanic. Formations seem to have less of an impact in Shogun 2. 

Other than these two elements, Shogun 2 is a great Game with much better expansions covering even the fall of the Samurai, adding naval battles and also Multiplayer.

Old (positive) review below.

The Linux version of this game is much more stable than the windows version. I have not yet experienced a crash. Feral has done a very good job on it. This includes playing rise of the samurai which has always been in my experience game breakinly buggy to the point I just never bothered with it.

It performs well unlike the Empire Total war port which runs horribly on my system and mods are fully integrated unlike their port of Dawn of War II.

So finally the glory of Creative Assembly's work can be experienced unadulterated by game crashes at the very end of long hard and tough battles or between 3 battles you forgot to quicksave at.

If you have played other Total War games or this is the first you are considering, there is definitely allot of content and fun experiences from the early days of Japan all the way to the industrialisation of the country. (Battleships are awesome!)

Plus you can enjoy it on any operating environment you prefer or have lying around with enough juice to rev the engine of this software. I don’t see why this would not be a good addition to any strategists library.",1497057881,1687035356,False,0,0,0.549921751022338867,0,True,False,False

Un très bon jeu, excellent de mon point de vue même.
Alors pourquoi un avis négatif ? Tout simplement que suite à la mise à jour mineur du 24/05/2023 la pop-up Mod Manager qui se lançait juste avant le jeu n'est plus. Du coup le jeu crash au lancement d'une partie, qu'elle soit nouvellement créée ou pas. 
Le passage dans les propriétés de l'onglet workshop n'y change pas grand chose et ne permet pas de régler quel mod on souhaite activer et quel autre ne l'est pas. Je n'ai pas testé le désabonnement de certains d'entre eux pour gérer les conflits mais je vous laisse faire le test vous-même si vous avez la foi.

Une solution en revanche fonctionnelle consiste à retourner dans les propriétés du jeu, onglet ""Bêtas"" et de sélectionner 'linux-pre-2022-update'. De cette façon les données modifiées retourneront à leur état d'avant patch, il sera nécessaire de laisser votre jeu réappliquer ces changements. Une fois fait, votre jeu est à nouveau opérationnel et la pop-up Mod Manager se lancera comme il faut, vous laissant le choix sur l'activation ou non de vos mods.

Une autre solution proposée par la communauté consiste à supprimer manuellement dans le fichier user.script.txt présent dans appdata/roaming/the creative assembly/shogun2/scripts le ou les mods pour ne lancer que ceux que vous voulez avoir. Je ne l'ai pas testée sachant que la première méthode est fonctionnelle et plus ergonomique :)

L'autre changement conséquent lié au patch est la suppression du chat pour les parties en ligne. Je n'en ai que rarement eu l'utilité personnellement mais je peux comprendre la frustration pour ceux ne voulant pas l'utilisation d'un moyen de communication tier qui était jusqu'à présent intégré nativement dans le jeu.

Je persiste à dire que ce jeu est vraiment excellent, malgré cette problématique, nous avons pour l'heure encore moyen de s'adapter et si vous n'y avez jamais joué, attendez une promo, il vaut vraiment le coup.


En espérant avoir pu vous être utiles, bon jeu à tous !

A very good game, excellent in my opinion.
So why the negative review? Quite simply that following the minor update of 24/05/2023, the Mod Manager pop-up that launched just before the game is no longer available. As a result, the game crashes when a game is launched, whether newly created or not. 
Switching to the workshop tab properties doesn't change things much, and doesn't allow you to set which mod you want to activate and which you don't. I haven't tested the mod manager yet. I haven't tested unsubscribing some of them to manage conflicts, but I'll let you do the test yourself if you have the faith.

A solution that does work, however, is to go back to the game properties, ""Betas"" tab and select 'linux-pre-2022-update'. This will return the modified data to its pre-patch state, so you'll need to let your game re-apply these changes. Once done, your game is back up and running, and the Mod Manager pop-up will launch as required, giving you the choice of whether or not to activate your mods.

Another solution proposed by the community consists of manually deleting the mods you wish to have from the user.script.txt file in appdata/roaming/the creative assembly/shogun2/scripts. I haven't tested it, as the first method is functional and more ergonomic :)

The other consequential change linked to the patch is the removal of chat for online part. I've rarely used it myself, but I can understand the frustration for those who don't want to use a third-party means of communication that was natively integrated into the game until now.

I still say that this game is really excellent, despite this problem, we still have a way to adapt and if you've never played it, wait for a discount, it's really worth it.

Granted, you'll notice it's age. Some features that are missing or just not being able to scale up the UI on an UW monitor. 

But nonetheless playing this game, solo or multiplayer, can entertain you for a long time. 
The music, artstyle, UI/UX design and atmosphere is amazing in this. 

I really wish and hope that they will release a TW: Shogun 3 and iterate on, and build upon Shogun 2 and hopefully don't try to reinvent the wheel too much. 

The cutscenes are awesome and the music that accompanies your play sessions really helps to immerse you into the world of feudal japan.

Even though I have the TW: Warhammer games I still prefer games that are grounded in reality, like TW: Rome, Medieval, Shogun etc.

If you can buy this game on a sale, get it - play it with a friend and talk on Discord (or w/e) and you'll have great moments and evenings!

1- you can not trespass on others' lands. imagine you are besieging someone's castle, if you make peace with them, the game is going to teleport your army from their province to a random place in your own territory. 
2- the cavalry units in this game are very weak, a cheap spear unit (known as Yari Ashigaru) can easily defeat three elite cavalry units just by standing still and no , charging from rear wont work against them. 
3- the final stage of the game, is totally unrealistic and illogical. why should every weak & undeveloped faction declare war on you as the mightiest faction in the game instead of trying to negotiate some sort of a deal with you? this is not how politics works in real world. and it wasnt certainly the case in the actual history of Japan.
4- more on Yari Ashigaru, this unit is capable of beating everyone only by holding their spears and standing still. raising the question that why should even bother ourselves with downloading the hero units & paying extra cash for recruiting samurai units
5- the naval battles are completely unrealistic and totally unplayable . a/ imagine you want to move a couple of thousands of your soldiers , you are going to need a ship right? okay, lets have a trade ship. cheapest option available. then okay there are two trade ships of one of our enemies attacking us. we go to the battle. there is no sign of your thousands of katana samurai & bow samurais , they just dont exist. they are somewhere hidden in the ship . you lose the battle , oh my god , you lost all of your soldiers. the entire army is gone! 
b/ the ai is capable of spamming fleets to some absurd level which makes naval battles even more unplayable than you can imagine.

Oh and the standard procedure where every other faction declare war on you from the other side of the map for no reason whatsoever.

The AI is capable of putting up a significant fight when on higher difficulties. 

The co-op campaigns are good and the game pace is managed very well. 

The technology aspects are good, but with a caveat that if you're playing on lower difficulties there's a good to strong likelihood that you'll win the game before reaching the bottom 2 layers of the tree itself.

The only minor gripes I have with the game are as follows:
 Agents are sometimes TOO powerful. If you haven't been nurturing at least 1 good ninja or metsuke from the beginning of the game and someone else has you will really struggle.

The morale mechanics in battle can go a bit awry. I've had examples of 200-300 ashigaru running away from 50 samurai. Which isn't completely insane, but what is insane is I was assaulting a town.... and my ashigaru decided to flee THROUGH the samurai they were supposedly running from (and still outnumbered 4-1)

Honestly though, I'm nitpicking... this game is still worth the price of any AAA title to this day and I'd happily pay it.

** UPDATE 12/05/23 **
Continuing on the subject of agents, I was surprised to learn the ""Chances of success"" number is actually completely fake. On my campaign I needed my agent to be successful in order to not lose a town. For the first time in a long and storied Shogun 2 career I decided to cheat and saved just before the agent action (67% chance of success). I'll admit it's possible I'm simply the unluckiest man on the planet, but I've so far reloaded the game and retried this action 25 times and gotten the exact same result every single time (failure but no harm to my agent).

The chances of that happening in a legitimate system are so vanishingly small there doesn't seem to be any other explanation other than that number is fake and in fact the game decides the outcome of agent actions based on (or at least heavily influenced by) factors which are hidden from the player.  

While that's quite disappointing, the game is nonetheless still good.",1550949198,1683916940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I am extremely disappointed in this game, even though I wanted to like it so bad.

The first half of the game I loved. Trying to carve out space for your clan in Japan, huge battles on Japanese castles with flaming arrows flying all around, making alliances and dealing with politics. It was great.

The second half of each game is terrible. It's when you hit a point called Realm Divided. When you claim too much land or try to take over Kyoto, basically every other clan magically allies with each other and declares war on you. Even when you become the Shogun. This results in you getting attacked from every direction and every front. And these other clans will never have peace with you for any offer, so the political aspect is thrown right out the window. This increased challenge would be welcomed but isn't feasible when you only can get up to a max of about 1/3 of japan before it begins. Again, every other clan is magically all in an alliance now and just hates you. IDK why they call it realm divided when the entire realm all unites just to fight you.

This would be doable, but a few other features ruin it for me. Eventually Christianity is introduced to Japan. The clans that adopt it can eventually send out missionaries. These missionaries can incite christian revolts. I had enemy clans attempt this 10 times, and every time it is successful. And then out of nowhere in a province that is 100% Buddhist or Shinto, a well trained army of over 2,000+ Christians rebels appears and instantly takes your town.

So while you are having a huge war on every border, the enemy Christian clans can send a cheap missionary and incite a max army size of rebels on a whim at barely any cost. 100% needs some balance changes.

Everything is great until you get to that realm divide point when politics are worthless. It is extremely frustrating and ruins all the fun of the game and realism. I consider myself a pretty alright player and was playing on hard difficulty up to this point. But once you get to the realm divide point I couldn't even do it on easy difficulty. Maybe I missed something in the game, maybe I just suck, I don't know.

I really recommend playing Rome remastered, Rome remastered (barbarians), Medieval II, Empire, shogun 2 (fall of the samurai) in that order. it basically spans 400 BC to 1900 AD pretty flawlessly as far as combat tactics are concerned. I really couldn't tell you what game best covers the 1900s forward and still maintains a firm grasp of tactics, strategies, and environmental aspects as well as the Total War series.

the ""new"" series (Rome II, Attila) I cannot recommend as much, not to say they are worthless, but all the Warhammer series, three kingdoms, and pretty much all the DLC/standalone extensions are pretty smart. that said there are plenty of issues with mechanics for each game, where the AI will game the system, there is a glaring historical inaccuracy (like in Attila), and mechanic problems where fluff doesn't match crunch or crunch doesn't match fluff. of cause cheesing the mechanics and making the map boundary counter a wall of flesh seems to work most of the time if you want to annoy the AI.

But with the more focused campaign Creative Assembly was able to focus more on overall gameplay rather than making a bunch of different cultures and diverse units. This means they have nearly perfected the overall feel and handling of the game from the way the battles handle to the crisp clean UI which does it's job while also looking great and matching the games tone. Not to mention this game boasts some of the best battle AI for any Total War game ( I know not saying much). One of the only negatives I have to say is that the naval battles aren't great. You'll usually lose more boats than you think you should which in turn leads to a lot of auto resolving.

I also have to mention that this game also has one of the best expansions to any Total War game, Fall of the Samurai! The expansion takes place in an entirely different era of Japan where gunpowder units rein supreme. But even then you can choose to stay traditional and use samurai units to charge into a hail of lead like you're reenacting a scene from the movie The Last Samurai!

Its pretty simple, 3 Bow Ashagara in loose formation should kill 1 Bow Ashagara. That is not the case, 3 units do in fact lose to one unit on legendary. 2 General units full hp charge into 1 Bow Ashagara... A Huge chance both generals die and units route. 80 Horsemen to 120 Bow of the weakest bow units. Lose when charging. Enemy 1 General unit charges 4 of your Bows, They route right away leaving a huge gap. Its a great game, but my God. After so many hours This game is broken on the harder difficulties not even giving the player any fun.  Just trying to do a fun run of a clan i never tried, just to be hit in the face with this B/S By turn 2 enemy factions have 3 samurai units. when it takes 2 turns to make one... If your gonna let the computer cheat atleast keep it in the perspective of the player. 3 samurai units equals 6 turns, not turn 2.  Also wtf is up with Fleet battles? why is it when u attack the enemy fleet charges you, charges past you, then glitches out on the bordors of the map? each sea battle takes a good 20 mins of fastest battle speed.

On anything above Normal Difficulty (something 50%+ of the fanboys have never tried, look at steam achivements for this game) the AI is a flat out ret*rded warmonger, You can be the most powerful faction on the map and a AI can be the weakest faction in the game with a single town and the moment you move your armies away from it's border (AI always have radar cheat on this game and know where every single army you have are) he will instantly backstab you even if you are in an alliance. Diplomacy might as well not even exist in the game because AI will just attack you on a whim with ofc increased bias to target the player.

If you take a single City the next 3 factions bordering that City will declare war on you, and they will always be in alliances with 1-3 other factions.

If you are at war with several factions alone you might as well give up, they will cheat and know where your armies are at all times, and will *NEVER* i repeat *NEVER* accept peace unless you kill all their armies, and waltz up to their last City and besiege them, If you arent one turn away from eliminating them from the game they will almost never ask for peace, which means you can never Eliminate one of them because the second you start moving towards him the other rats in the throng will just pick at you from all sides.

AI will deny trade with you even if it benefits them because they would rather deny you resources than gaining more themselves.

Unit diversity is non existant, all factions play the same and most have pathetically tiny bonuses that have 0 impact.

The Actual battles AI is equally moronic, There are many cheese strategies you can abuse and AI just falls for it everytime.

Worst of all is the games obnoxious drone fanboy community, that spreads their sh*t everywhere, screeching how this pile of garbage is the best total war game whenever you try to discuss any other game in the franchise.",1597881726,1680657435,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

of course the game is not perfect there is bugs and on top of that the multiplayer is not very popular but has one of my favourite strategy approaches. I wish we could have more multiplayer campaign players 2 is good 5 be amazing.

The game excels at streamlining the campaign map management compared to other Total war games while adding depth to the mechanics involved with different strategies you take. Players won’t be overwhelmed at the start of the game with cluttered tabs or overlays.

The battles themselves are excellent as well. You have baseline units with counters for each as well as more expensive units that fall deeper into specific unit types. All factions have access to the same units to recruit with each faction getting bonuses Ro certain unit types. Battles can be as demanding/rewarding or as cheesy as you want, both options are available 🧀 The diplomacy is broken (a feature in almost every Total war game) and the Realm divide mechanic is brutal at times but not impossible. Those would be my only big gripes, but it’s a small list compared to other Total war titles.

Pros:
*interesting
*rewarding wins
*time-sucking micro-managing
*battle control

cons:
*Crashes almost every 10 minutes on Mac. No fix. I'd be angry if I payed more than I did.

*Too darn hard, even on easy. It gets sort-of easier once you get down every dang little thing you have to manage and decide. ""Easy mode"" doesn't alter some things.

*Really unfair AI; it's always able to upgrade past me even though I put the time in - which is lame.

It’s good, it’s really good. There’s no two ways about it. It’s simply one of the best total war games ever made. If you’re wondering if it still holds up in 2023, yes. Yes it does. And while both Shogun 2 and it’s DLC/ spin-off “Fall of the Samurai” are amazing im mostly focused on the base game you’re currently on the shop page for. 

The time period and conflict is basically a multi faction civil war in feudal Japan. But each clan is unique. Most of them have elite units or buffs that make it easier to composite your armies certain ways. The AI takes advantage of this. So while lots of units look the same there’s still a lot of diversity in the actual battles. 



Campaign
- The campaign map is beautiful and interactive. It’s relatively large with it being a very daunting task to “capture” the whole of Japan. 
-diplomacy, trade, nation building etc are the same as other games. Takes after the Empire TW idea of having a main castle/city with other resource gatherings and wealth creating buildings placed around larger regions. This makes it so you can cut off food to a region during sieges and take a more multi-dimensional path in war. 
- the voice lines for your generals and the tutorial women are glorious 
- Naval warfare exists, although Iv never found them particularly relevant. Still cool to have though, wooden box ships fighting each other with fire arrows is cool
- the time period is really cool and European traders + Wako pirates are factions in the campaign. 

Battles 
- AI is pretty good and if on high difficulty will utilize complicated tactics. 
- due to the aforementioned time period flint lock musket units and bowmen both have their place in battle and throughout the lengthy campaign. 
- there’s a surprising array of differing melee units from the various factions, this is especially true in the campaign as AI factions randomly build buildings that let them create a more diverse set of units. 

Multiplayer
- it exists and it for the most part works albeit a bit janky 
- multiplayer campaign is an absolute blast with the homies. You can help each other, fight against each other and even fight as the AI opponent in your friends battles. If speciation your friends they can gift you units to use so overall it’s pretty cool. (Multiplayer campaigns also count for campaign based achievements if you’re into that) 

Atmosphere
- it’s one of the more atmospheric Total Wars and will feel immensely different from TW Three Kingdoms, TW Rome 2, Empire TW, etc. 
- the art style, Japanese impressionist paintings on the loading screen, the stylistic choices of the user interface and even the  ever present animated face of your generals will make you truly feel like a feudal Japanese daimyo. 
- even if you know nothing about Japan or care about the historical significance, you can still march your army against other clans having fun. 

Steam deck
- This games does not work well on the steam deck. It crashes every couple min

The game is a shinning emerald in the ever growing sea of bland total war releases. (Y’all ever hear of Thrones of Britannia? No? Good, keep it that way) it’s a testament to timeless game design and replay ability. Right before I wrote this review I checked the multiplayer battles to see if there was any action. There were a few, hanging on. Not that it matters, you like most people probably just want to jump on to that amazing campaign

But the multiplayer (even if near death) does deserve praise for the extensive customization options for your general, and an intricate progression system. 

This game has European bought cannons, wooden Trebuchets, bomb throwers, peasant archers, samurai archers, katana men, peasants with matchlock muskets, peasants with spears, mounted archers, mounted samurai and so much more. 

If you’re wondering if it’s worth the $30 being over a decade old, I wouldn’t blame you and I can confidently say the enjoyment you will feel when your elite samurai take the capital and proclaim you shogun will make the price meaningless. 

Long live the Shogun!!!

My first Total War game, so this one has a lot of nostalgia associated with it. To be frank, my mind was blown back then and I was instantly hooked. An absolute classic.

Bad things
Naval battles suck a lot, autoresolve help just with part of it. You chase ships around the map, because they avoid conflict and retreat very far away, you usually do not reach them in the same turn. And next turn it repeats. For armies, you can use ninja sabotage army to avoid its retreat, but for fleets, there is no option. And experience do not improve accuracy of ships...

There is no cities overview, so you need to check each of them separately (there are 60 required for long campaign)

In battle, it is not clear where your troops can go and where cannot. In hilly terrain it can be frustrating and break perfect plan quickly.


The good
Combat is great, basic units can be useful even in late game if used correctly (yari wall).
Units feels nicely balanced, best units are better but usually with lower numbers and with twice as much basic units they can still loose.
Campaign is loooong, but can be frustrating sometimes because of mechanics above

But don’t get The Fall of the Samurai. It’s very propagandized with the horrible westerner there to ruin Japan, forcing terrible goods and liberties on them when everyone was just singing smurfily, instead of before - being enslaved by the Shogun and daimyos and stagnating. It lost its credibility.

You can really have challenges that others have never given me, and you can really tell when you get into a multiplayer fight. With effectively a chess match between an opponent, making constant back-and-forth skirmishes.

Alright, Now here's some random advice for some fun:
() If you get bored of vanilla, add the extra provinces and clans mod: 
It can really drown you and if you're like me its alot of fun
() Try fall of the samurai afterwards; Its fun in...its own way, but is less chess, more 'super Napoleon'. Its also less paced or challenging
()Add the FOTS mods as well, especially if you have to deal with a western front in your strategies with constant sieges. A bit of a warning though; It makes a one sided fight even more of a meat grinder: If you thought 'pikes in front of walls, guns on top' is overpowered, then these forts make them much worse.",1674345417,1674345417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing previous total war titles I didn't expect much except skins and voices to be different, I expected the core game mechanic to be the same... 

For example...

I didn't expect bow units to be devastating... My first battle, I was shocked... Sucking down a drink, snacking on some fries, sending my yari units in to slice up some enemy bow units... I had very few bow units and was lightly invested in ranged units... My yari troops marched to their deaths under a hail of enemy arrows... I shot soda snot and choked on my fries as I bared witness to the murder of my troops...

Samurai units are also pretty brutal... but you kinda get the idea later that powerful units come at a heavy cost of food and money...

Regardless of all that, I was shook... I got sucked into this title off and on for YEARS!!!

But without anything to give it flavour, you're going to get tired of it real quick. I’ve heard that Fall of the Samurai is much better, but it’s something that I think still has some of the core issues I’ve listed below so I’m not in any rush to get around to it. The main frustrations I had with the game are as follows. 

Lack of faction diversity. All factions in this game, bar the Ottomo and the Ikko Ikki, play more or less exactly the same. They all have the same end goal, tech tree, religion and are all Japanese. The only thing differentiating them apart are the occasional slight changes to core units to give them +2 melee charge or cheaper recruitment, or something along those lines. There isn't even anything to represent China or Korea, despite the historical Korean invasion of 1592-1598 potentially lending itself well to this game. Furthermore, the European influence of the Portuguese is only limited to several units for the Ottomo, they don't even show up as their own faction! It's not like in Empire Total War, a game that is panned by all Total War players, where every faction gets some truly unique units, religion and voice lines. Could you imagine playing Medieval, Empire or Napoleon, with all nations replaced by the British? That's what playing Shogun 2 feels like, it has very limited replayability. 

Boring tech tree. Getting to the mid/lower parts of the tech tree doesn’t really reward you with better units like it does in Empire. Instead, most units are unlocked at the early-mid game which means that there isn’t much incentive to focus on tech expansion, which you couldn’t even if you wanted since you can only research one tech at a time. Some siege/gunpowder units are definitely not worth trying to get, as Matchlock Ashigaru, European Cannons andFire Projecting Mangonels are all pretty bad with much better options available.

Ashigaru spam. You’ll be seeing stacks of Yari/Bow ashigaru (i.e spear/bow peasantry) in the early game and sometimes even into the late game, where they have no right being there. This isn’t made any better by the fact that types of units (sword/spear infantry, cav, siege, bows) all need their own buildings to be trained from, which thus makes it a whole lot easier for the AI to spam them. Even on Legendary difficulty in realm divide I’ve seen ashigaru making up half of a full stack army, even though Katana/Naginata samurai are much better. If you love fighting against peasants, this is the game for you. 

Removal of features/dumbing down from previous Total Wars. No tech/province trading means that you’ll sometimes be signing peace treaties on poor terms, as sometimes the AI simply has no money to give.  Naval battles are even worse than in Empire, here you’ve traded in cannons for bows and it is as painful and boring as it sounds. I once spent at least 15 minutes trying to take out a medium bune with a cannon bune, where it didn’t even seem to be close to being destroyed. Just pass on the naval battles, they are awful here. Granted, the perks for agents/generals/family certainly made them more fun to use as opposed to Empire, so I should give credit where credit is due. 

Also, blood pack DLC is cancer, it should be base game. At least put it on sale sometimes CA.

All in all, I’m not really a fan of Shogun 2. If you like the idea of a game set in feudal Japan focused solely on the more traditional ways of fighting, then you’ll love this game. Otherwise, you’ll be getting bored real quick with the lack of replay value.",1673666143,1673666143,False,4,1,0.487370997667312622,1,True,False,False

Total War: SHOGUN 2 - Dragon War Battle Pack (This DLC is already part of the Fall of the Samurai game which is basically part of Shogun 2 as it is a standalone expansion).  You already know if you want this game or not so I'm just going to tell you everything you need to know:

DLC that actually adds content:

Total War: SHOGUN 2 – Otomo Clan Pack DLC
Total War: SHOGUN 2: Saints and Heroes Unit Pack
Total War: SHOGUN 2 - The Ikko Ikki Clan Pack
Total War: SHOGUN 2 - Sengoku Jidai Unit Pack
Total War: SHOGUN 2 - Rise of the Samurai Campaign
Total War: SHOGUN 2 - The Hattori Clan Pack

DLC that is purely cosmetic:

Total War: Shogun 2 - Blood Pack DLC

Then there's the ""Fall of the Samurai"" standalone expansion.  If you search for it in Steam you'll see the game and then you'll see what looks like 4 DLC's for it, however each of those 4 DLC items actually comes with the ""Fall of the Samurai"" so you only need Fall of the Samurai and you'll have all 4 of those.

All in all, you can expect to pay about $23 for Shogun 2, all of the DLC that actually has content, + the Fall of the Samurai expansion.  It comes to about $26 if you care about the cosmetic ""Blood Pack DLC,"" but honestly there will always be better ways to spend $3 on Steam.  That's at the 75% discount anyway, which I've seen this game discounted at twice in the past 3 months.

Don't waste your time researching if a ~$1 piece of DLC is ""worth it,"" it isn't worth the man hours to save that dollar anyway (especially since at least 80% of the time you're probably going to get that DLC you're considering anyway so really you only stand to save 20 cents in the long run).

(updated)

I have owned Shogun 2 since the release and it has undergone some major overhauls in that time, however, one thing has stayed the same throughout: The game is great.

I will say this right away, for some people this game is not their cup of tea; if you do not like strategy/management combined with Turn-based/RTS then this game is not for you (Any de-sync issues that originally existed have been eliminated, and even if an issue does ever crop up, the host call always share the save file to fix the issue).


However, if you DO like Turn-based/RTS, I cannot recommend this game any higher. 
This is hands down one of my FAVOURITE strategy games of all time; I have had some epic battle moments with this game and I quite enjoy the RPG/planning elements on the campaign map. I've known people to play this game purley for the battles. I would recommend getting some mods to improve AI/balance/gameplay, such as Radious or Darthmod (whichever you prefer; personally I use Radious as there are many different versions).

Pros:
+Excellent turn-based/RTS elements
+Choose from many different factions each with their own specialties and flavour (more with mods or DLC)
+Compatible with many different PC system specs
+Online Multiplayer + Campaign Co-op
+Very high replayability
+Tons of mods to allow for greater customization / tweaking / balancing
+Blood & Gore DLC: 'Watch as your samurai stabs an enemy Daiymo in the gut then slices his head off as he falls to his knees'  :)


Cons:
-Campaigns can potentially take a long time; do not forget though you can always auto-resolve battles to speed things up
-AI can be weak/cheesed in some situations (improved with mods)


Overall, I have very few gripes with this game. After playing it for so long I can say for certain if you like a mix of turn-based/RTS games, you will fall in love with shogun 2.

- Addicting real time strategy combat
- With dlcs you have 3 diffrent scenarios/Time Periods (Genpei War, Sengoku-jidai, Boshin War)
- The base game is nicely balanced because most of the factions have the same units (each faction gets one special unit)
- You have to storm Kyoto and oust the weak Ashikaga!

Cons
- Rise of the Samurai feels more like a reskin of the base game
- Dlc locked factions...
- The diplomacy is most of the time confusing (look for a strategy guide pro tipp: you can sell the AI passage throug your land for koku and a trading agreement - Don´t sell them indefinetly passage because you want a steady stream of koku)
- Multiplayer mostly dead
- They banned an OG Chat Channel which I won´t explicitly mention here but one was hot naginata .... and one was hot ashigaru ...",1648945351,1669659191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Returning to the artistic masterpiece Shogun 2 has been a treat. The graphics are a solid 10 after 11 years due to the unique approach CA took when designing this game. The challenge of the game is fair to the player, but on legendary you'll need to use all of the game's concepts in a cohesive way to beat the ultimate challenge. Dialogue and cutscenes are immersive and fun, with the overall experience of the game making you feel like you are in a total war.

Some would say Realm Divide is an unfair mechanic, but I think this helps resolve some of the staleness of the end game (auto-resolve>auto-resolve>auto-resolve etc).

Overall I would rate Shogun 2 a 10 for graphics, a 9 for balanced gameplay and a 10 for immersion. Truly a unique game worth playing.",1666696691,1666696691,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Shogun 1 Total War and the Mongol Invasion expansion pack were the first original games I ever owned in my life. I must have played that game for 10+ years, and even tho I loved Rome: Total War, my heart always returned to Shogun 1. 

Last week, I loaded Shogun 2 for the first time, and I admit Shogun 2 is an improvement in almost every aspect over the original game, it does lack certain 'soul' such as missing the emissaries coming into the war-room to discuss diplomacy with you, I also remember the ninja videos being cooler than what we have now, I have yet to see any geishas in shogun 2, and the original soundtrack being delegated to Loading Screen Music pains my heart. But my god, there is no greater feeling than literally headshotting the enemy general with a cannon ball or Yari-lock the entire enemy army to death.

Slow start at early game, but when it reach mid-end game. Oh boy does the game starts to throw not just rocks at you, but a whole chunk of it to your face.

Though with perfect planning, try and error. You would eventually get the hand of it.

Gameplay
----------

You play as either the 12 factions in the game, fighting over conquer over Japan by taking over the capital and holding it for a year, which then you would win the war afterwards

Each factions has their own traits, their advantages and their own disadvantages. No matter which factions you pick you will have trouble along the way, but that is the fun of it. Though picking the easier starting factions would be slightly more forgiving and allow you to learn the game till you are ready for a more challenging start

Once you have picked a faction, you have numbers of problems, just like in real life.. You have to manage your resources well, two most important are gold and your food source. Without those, you will be broke and hungry daimyo with your people chunking rocks at your face. 

However, managing this two resources often than not can be rather complicated at times. Recruit too much soldiers? Upkeep. Trying to expand and upgrade your castle? Food upkeep. This are the things that make this game fun to manage and plan ahead when you most needed

Your army, research and development
----------

There are lots of variants and types of army you can recruit to fight for you and expand further on, you can even recruit agents within the game to do non-combat roles most of the time to sabotage your enemies or allies alike if you want to. But that comes at the cost of needing specific buildings, specific research before you can reach to that stage, that would take lots of turns. But once you have reach that stage of development, you will feel completely powerful and have an edge over the others, its a feeling that I can't describe it but once you have reach there, you will understand why

AI
---------

When I said the AI don't really play fair, they often don't, they will find ways to screw you over, be it disrupting your trade routes or simply attacking you because they do not like you or want to take your very nice lands, but you can do the same to them as well if you want to and have the capability to, they basically force you to adapt to tough situation when you least expect it

DLC
--------

I haven't played rise of the samurai so I can give a proper review on that one but I was fortunate enough to be able to play fall of samurai, I would give a simple review on it in word. ""Guns"".

Final review
--------
Do I recommend this game? Does it enable your thirst for conquest?

Well, this game can be frustrating at times but once you have crossed over that herd of flames and bullshit. Its the best damn feeling you will ever get in this game.

I give this game a 10 out of the lands spread across the maps

It feels authentic for the time and while it isn't Medieval, the War for Japan really is something to be delighted about. Maybe it's also personal preference, but your battles feel earned compared to later ones especially on higher difficulties. The longer you continue to fight, the harder it gets with Religion, raiding, and just total standstills at time. 

Agents are necessary to maintain control of the Campaign Map. Shinobi to Assassinate and Sabotage, Metsuke to stop enemy agents, Priests to maintain public order, without them, you're screwed. And you have to start early to have an advantage over everyone else.

My biggest complaint is the Fame system. The more battles you win and more factions you destroy, the more fame you get. Eventually, you'll trigger an end game where EVERYONE wants your blood. Any carefully crafted Alliances are shattered and any trade agreements are worthless. Meaning you have to rely on brute force and strategy.

It's an RTS, you can try to play as a passive trader, a conqueror or something in-between. You can talk with nearby provinces to persuade them to your side or persuade them to become enemies with your enemies. The AI is not super smart when you battle it but your friends in multiplayer can play as the AI you are going up against.

There are a few negative issues with the game in multiplayer. My game did crash on startup, plus the screens where you choose where you can start on the map didn't work for me in one match. A few other popup screens in the game also were broken so I couldn't make certain choices in others. My friend told me that I was supposed to see an option screen so I expected it. The screen was there but there was nothing to click, I realized after that it was probably a bug related to the others for me. My computer isn't old so I think it has to do with the age of this game and a DirectX incompatibility on my part.

personally I really like how you now have some degree of control on how your generals/characters develope(skill tree/semi random retainers), it makes you much more invested in them.

combat seems to be fine tuned and more responsive, positioning of your general is really vital to sucess due to the sphere of influene, so want to place him close to your troops but also avoid getting him killed.

graphics are gorgeous if you have the machine power for it(currently I don't :-( but I still enjoy it)

as for the bad things the two things I can think of is
1) loading times can be really long, especially the startup is tiring.
2) in some aspects the game is even slower than previous games, since a year is now 4 rounds rather than 2 it takes forever for your family-tree to expand.(e.g. sons first gets useful at age 16 so you have to play 64 rounds)",1342266943,1659629164,True,0,0,0.459919095039367676,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game to any player who is seeking an entertaining time with lots of unit types, including fun spies and ninjas.  There is tactics and strategy nicely balanced out and both land and sea battles.  You can guide your Clan as you like, making war or peace or trading treaties, etc. with others all at a turn-based pace that allows for thinking about your choices and then carrying them out.

You can carry out battles automatically or command the troops directly so there are some RTS qualities thrown in here and there but not face-paced FPS type action.  But that's what I like.  This is a game for when you want to relax and rule and direct rather than chop, hack or shoot one on one.

This game sparked a love for RTS games within me and brought a lot of enjoyment. It's a solid game with a very unique game-play between the fall of samurai (FOTS) and the Shogun campaign. The Shogun combat is much faster and balanced to a rock and paper vs scissors formula. As well, the FOTS combat feels very devastatingly good. I love seeing riflemen flatten a cavalry charge or when canons blow up a castle sky high. The mini-cinematic make the world more immersive.

Now returning to this game, since I first played, it makes me appreciate more how well Shogun 2 was crafted with care. The newer total war games have lost their charm; this is the peak of Creative Assembly creation.",1450820604,1658476720,True,3,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

I came to the total war series late, and I only got around to Shogun 2 this year.

I always heard Shogun 2 was the best game in the series. I had a passing interest in the Sengoku period. So why did I avoid it for so long?

I had an odd misconception about what the game was really about, that kept me from giving it a chance. You see, in Real Life, my father was killed in a pointless and stupid war. Meaningless butchery has always offended me, even in fiction. I thought the Sengoku period was fascinating, but I had no interest at all in pretending to be some feudal Daimyo.

Even in a computer game, I have to feel like there is some greater purpose behind the fighting. Some ideological conflict that can only be resolved by war. And so far  as I could see, it made no difference which family of useless, narcissistic sociopaths got to exploit, rape and murder the productive segment of the nation.

What piqued my interest, was when I found out I could play as the Ikko-Ikki; a group with which I actually sympathized. Fanatic Buddhists who said FEUDALISM SUCKS and tried to burn the whole rotten system down. Naturally, they weren't too popular with the establishment.

And sure, for the average peasant, it probably didn't make much difference if you were being squeezed by an entitled ass or a delusional monk, but at least the Ikkis offered hope for a better future.

It isn't just the Ikko-Ikki though; there's plenty of ideological conflict in the game, and some of it isn't immediately obvious. I'm going to break down the factions to explain what I see as real differences between them. And bear in mind, I'm talking in-game, which is only loosely based on the real clans (some of which still exist today).

The Traditionalists: With their obsession on personal honor and loyalty, and the cult of the sword, the Shimazu are the embodiment of the old ways. They've held the same territory in the south of Kyushu for centuries, to the point where they're pretty much a nation into themselves. The Takeda clan is their counterpart in the north. The traditionalists just want the civil war to finally end, so they can go back to reading poetry and tending the graves of their ancestors.

The Outsider clans: The Mori, Chosokabe, Uesugi and Date are also very conservative, but in one way or another they exist on the frontiers of Japanese society. They trace much of their ancestry back to the Chinese, Koreans, or even aboriginal people who lived in Japan since the stone age. They're physically distant from the Imperial court, a bit rough around the edges, and in the case of the Mori they have extensive contact with various barbarians. They tend to have unconventional, oddly specialized militaries.

The innovators: The Tokugawa, Oda and Hojo are traditional clans, but they are more ready than most to adapt to new ways of doing things. In the case of the Oda, they're more willing to rely on peasant soldiers. This means their army is more meritocratic generally. (One Oda vassal, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was born a peasant and rose to be, for a short time, de facto ruler of Japan). The Hojo are masters of architecture and gunpowder engines.

The Radicals: The Ikko-Ikki follow a strange sect of Buddhism. Their fanatical followers want to bring down the old order and create a heavenly brotherhood on Earth. The Otomo are even more radical; they're bent on making Japan a Christian nation. (Christianity is much more firmly established in Shogun 2 than it was in the same time frame in real life- the real life Otomi were tolerant of Christianity but not wholly converted to it, and Christianity spreads much more quickly in game than it actually did).

The Outcasts: The Hattori are the least ""historical"" of the factions in the game. In game they're the leaders of the Iga Ikki, which was a loose confederation of peasants and Jizamurai, whose skill in guerrilla warfare gave rise to the myth of the ninja. In real life they just wanted to be left alone, but in game they have the chance to spread their guerrilla insurgency across all Japan.

And now that I understand each faction better, it's easy for me to slip into the role playing aspect of the game. I've played most factions and each feels pretty different, on and off the battlefield.

I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone who is offended by gross historical inaccuracies- there's the usual CA silliness in regards to not understanding how pre-modern weapons and tactics work. The tactical battles are still the best part of the game, though also a bit frustrating- the land battles are much too fast, and the AI tactics amount to either standing on top of the steepest hill in the game and refusing to budge or having the entire army charge at once. To the point where most battles remind me of that monty python sketch where a bunch of old ladies say they're going to re-enact the attack on pearl harbor, but it just consists of them screaming and hitting each other with their purses. And, by contrast, the naval battles are much, much too slow, especially in the early game where you're trying to sink enemy vessels with bows and arrows and you haven't yet figured out the secret of making fire.

So yeah, deeply flawed, but still better than any of the other Total War titles.",1657812484,1657812484,True,2,0,0.50906062126159668,0,True,False,False

However, this is not a new release, it's been out for years. The primary feature of the campaign is that after your clan attains a certain level of power, all other factions declare war on you. This is referred to as the ""realm divide."" If this happened after you controlled say 40-60% of the map, it would be okay, however because your prominence increases each time you take a province or win a battle, the realm divide is often triggered at a point where victory is not possible. Further, something missing from all total war games of this era is decent diplomacy. If you have a vassal state, the ai does recognize that if they declare war on that state, you are also called into war. So each time you create a vassal, the ai recognizes the vassal as a weak state and immediately declares war. Further there a few features to improve relations, place trade embargoes, join wars, or enforce peace, as would exist with comparable games like Europa Universalis. Lastly, by comparison to other total war games, cavalry is almost useless in this. Often four or five cavalry units are required to destroy one infantry unit.

Shogun 2, FOTS, however, is a close second, and is particularly notable for its naval combat and far more devastating (possibly *too* devastating) artillery.

It bears mentioning, though, that one of the things that holds FOTS back is that same naval warfare - specifically on the campaign screen. Simply put: it is far too easy for the AI to just sail around your fleets, blockade your ports, and bankrupt you without any real opportunity for counterplay. In other TW games, this really isn't possible, since you are able to safeguard your ports with relative ease (given a significant [but not ludicrous] investment in navies0. But in FOTS, you either slay every single enemy fleet taking some long route through deep water to strike at your ports, or you lose. And that... kind of sucks.

Pros -

#1.Still decent graphics for 2020

#2.Difficult to become shogun on normal difficulty.It is not easy and that is good.

#3.Many units and upgrades

#4.Your strategy is very important

#5.I like the music

#6.There is Multiplayer but I never tried it


Cons-


#1.My biggest problem with this game is that you can have the best army and still get killed by their assassin and it can kill all the progress and time you put into the game to get to that point.

I am not even calling it unrealistic it is just lame when it happens.I understand we can do it back to them but I wish they were not so OP when maxed out.


#2.The time limit to become shogun

I had this same problem with Empire total war. I dont like the main game having a time limit.I understand that in real life there is time limits as we die of old age and that there can be a certain about of time to do things.

It does not really apply to either game though as if you/your people/country are trying to take over everything even if you personally die it does not mean your people/country are going to stop doing it and they have to still stop you.

I understand the time limit speeds things along but I would have removed it and made it more like Rome 2 where there is no time limit like that.


#3.The AI can be stupid

This is how all total war games are but it should be said when it happens.This is why some players only do multiplayer battles only.


#4.That everyone turns on you when the shogun makes you the enemy


This just isnt realistic.I understand that it can make the game harder and more of a challenge and some like that but if someone was always your ally/friend and one day the shogun says that we are now their enemy for them to just agree with that could get their whole civilization destroyed by us.

It would be like declaring war against a friend and knowing he could burn your cities to the ground easily but the shogun told you to so you have to.



The Bottom Line -


Total War: SHOGUN 2 is a fun turn based strategy game.I got enjoyment out of it but I still like Rome 2 more.

I would get SHOGUN 2 on a steam deal and they even do free weekends with it sometimes.

Watch some youtube gameplay of it if you still not sure.",1590186413,1655713132,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

From medieval you have an ai that does some silly things and that can be cheesed (I guess like all total wars haha). 

But it's a fantastic mix of both these games and it comes together in the fall of the samurai dlc which adds a fun diversity to the vanilla game with more developed gunpowder combat. 

The vanilla itself is superb, I'm a huge fan, even with the cheating on the legendary difficulty - it's done in a way that makes it very challenging yet not outrageous. Can have armies without generals, agents are nuanced as are the units (blade, spears, cavalry, missile cavalry, missiles, muskets and artillery).

I think this is a superb title and is worth a playthrough - plus it has multiplayer. 

Challenging fun title, Rise of the Samurai was particularly difficult. Remember although everyone remembers your Daimyo, you should never forget the Yari Ashigari that propped them up - probably the best (at least cost effective) unit in total war history

Shogun Total War was my first entry into the Total War franchise. I still love Shogun Total War Collection, the original version or v1.  I have MTW and ETW.

In Shogun 2, the feel of the more recent Total War games are vividly apparent, and easy to get right into play. But there are things I miss from STW1 that is absent or limited in STW2: STW allowed unlimited ninja and shinobi agents, whereas STW2 limits to just 5 ninja (unrealistic for playing Hattori clan) and no shinobi agents; and in STW you could have multiple katana hero units, where in STW2 you can only have 1 katana hero, bow and yari heros.

The main thing is miss from STW1 is the throne room and the really great ingame video, especially the master sword dojo video showing the 7 cut form.

I really love the ingame music. I bought the soundtrack so I could listen offline.

I play STW2 by hooking up my gaming desktop to a 55 inch 4K TV - playing on a big screen results in a total immersion experience.

I received the base game free but willingly bought the dlcs as well as other games in the series.

This game combines the political and economical aspects of running a state, along with recruiting and using the armies of the time period. You can easily field hundreds of units just fine on a mid tier computer and watch as each man fights for their lives and their clan with everything they have.

This game has samurai, spearmen, cavalry, bows, guns, cannons, and more. You can do land battles, sieges, ship battles, and more.

This game is a must buy for history lovers and strategy games alike.

The final thing I would like to mention is the largest 2 dlcs add entire new campaigns in different time periods, the better of the two being the fall of the samurai. That campaign is set during the boshin war and has more modern gun and cannon  gameplay unlike the base game.

However, since a few years I´ve been unable to do so due to continuous crashing upon launch. It begins to start, having me to choose between DirectX 9 or 11, then gets to the first of title/launch screens, and crashes. Have tried several of the tips and flow charts presented online in order to fix the problem, verifying files etc etc. but without any result and is now just so tired of it. 

Tried to at least get a hold of the DLC Fall of the Samurai as it nowadays is more presented as a stand-alone game, so bought it on this last period of discount with the hope of perhaps being able to circumvent this problem and at least be able to play that part of the game. However, there´s no individual title in the library when you buy it,  as its combined with Shogun 2, hence the problem still remains and Im unavaible to play that part as well.

We love all kinds of games, but one of the best series is the Total War series. We played through this one first of all, and plan to move on with the Warhammer titles, probably after Three Kingdoms.
I just wanted to make clear that we like these games. But this shit... This is just ridiculous. The AI is cheating as hell, not in a fun way. We are playing on hard, for some challenge, but not overwhelming. We have experience, but we cannot do much about things that are just straight up cheating. Enemy armies just spawning basically, ships coming out of nowhere (we literally had ships spawning in from a faction that didn't have any ports).
The amount of this is just so overwhelming that it ruins the fun completely. WE made it fun, because we are long-time friends, and we made a joke of everything, but there was a point when we got to the Fall of he Samurai campaign that we couldn't take anymore. We didn't finish yet, but it's pretty much in the next 10-15 turns what's happening, then we decide if we continue, or just quit completely.
I don't even want to imagine what it would be like on legendary difficulty. People that can bear that shit have my honest respect
All-in-all, it's not a bad game, but because of the AI I cannot recommend. Please just get me a title that has a somewhat decent AI that is reasonable, and doesn't just use infinite resources to spawn in armies every turn out of nowhere. Make it use resources, have limits to money, and tech (having a legendary dojo built in the 20th turn is just wow).
If the AI will improve ever, then I will be open to recommending it to anyone.
Multiplayer is fun though, but only because it doesn't have an AI to deal with, if I lose at least I know I fucked up, or the enemy was better than me.

I started with a few mods, then added more, and then once i got use to the game and started upping the difficulty i was surprised at how i was still surviving on hard and very hard. i thought that perhaps some of the mods were giving me a boost so i actually turned off all the mods that added or changed things other than bug fixes and QOL updates, and was still surprised that i could handle defending, attacking and economic growth really well. Once you have some tactics down, some that are just cheesie yari spear wall (which is super op and fun to use when youre out numbered or anytime that is) and know how some units work and act under the ai it gets down to how you form, order and move your armies and individual units that determines your wins. Some times you can be out numbered 3 to 1 and still survive and even win by playing the battlefield and game mechanics right (doing things that impact morale is a good way to get through regardless of being outnumbered.) I've only ever played as Oda Nobunaga, because he is my favorite (Drifters the anime was when i first learned about him and his character design and personality i thought were great in that show, also i know that its not historically accurate but still). But the other clans have some cool things to change up your tactics with with bonuses or extra things in one area that another may not have. Anyways, its a fun game and can feel complicated to learn all the features and battle mechanics but its so much fun and definitely rewarding once you have those down and wipe out an army that outnumbers you by alot.

If you are a fan of history, and you love the medieval Japan era (samurais and all that), AND you also are looking for a game that kind of tries to be a sort of battle simulator, where you can make your historical army, recreate battles, feel like you are a real general of the era, then i do dare say that TOTAL WAR games might be for you. Total war games mix turn-base strategy campaign maps with real-time strategy in the battles that will decide the fate of your kingdom.  But is SHOGUN for you? probably. I always tell people to choose a total war based on your favourite time-period in history. But it's not necessary to be a samurai enthusiast to enjoy this game

Having played almost all total war games except for the Warhammer series, thrones of britannia and Three kingdoms, I can safely say that this is the total war game with which i had the best overall experience.

The game has 3 different campaigns but for the sake of the review i'll focus on the base Shogun 2 campaign: 
You get to play as one of the main 10(?) clans of Japan's medieval Civil war - Sengoku Jidai. Each clan has a speciality but every faction shares roughly the same roster of units and technology, barring unique features. In the campaign you will have to try and make good armies to take over other clans, make alliances and trade deals, and also develop your provinces to sustain your war effort to become the new shogun. you will fight both on Land and Sea, you can choose to do the battle yourself or let the AI auto-resolve the conflicts. The game even introduces a mechanic to stop the snowball effect that is present in previous total war games with the Realm Divide event where once you become too strong, all clans gang up on you and you have to fight for survival, you either conquer all or die trying.

Battles in this game, even after so many years are still some of the most beautiful. Graphics are great and battles feel well balanced. Contrary to most total war games. every faction shares almost the same exact roster of units, and then every faction will have 1 or 2 or 3 unique units, and it makes a lot of sense thematically because this game is about a japanese civil war, makes sense that clans share the same technology. you need to be smart about your army composition. units kind of work in a rock-paper-scissors system so always pick your fights within fights carefully. battles in this game are really fun because they can get really intense. There's a good deal of skill expression in them. You truly feel like a real general playing this game.

Not much else to add. this game has been always a joy to come back to. it's not perfect, but it's great and probably the best one in my books. 9/10",1651432421,1651433162,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I love Japanese culture and history, so this one as a starting point was a no-brainer. Challenging, deep, satisfying.... Yeah, this game's really good. Each campaign is not only a new approach(clan) but another chance to further optimise your gameplay.

Have only won a campaign with Date, failed my 2 other ones :(

It feels like its build as ""against the player"" game, rather than a game where rules are the same for everybody, for example, if you reach certain level of power other clans will go against you, but if they reach that level of power first, others wont go against them.

This ""all against one"" thing also added bigger accent on diplomacy wich i think is pretty lame in general, but even more when you keep in mind that total war AI, at least when it comes to diplomacy, is pretty bad.

Agents are also too powerful for my taste, not too OP tho, but still far more powerful than in previous total war games.

Unlike later titles, you can tell that this game was made with love and care, having small, but ultimately meaningful features such as family trees & agent cutscenes. features that has generally been scrapped in later games, possibly deemed to be unnecessary for the core gameplay loop, but if you ask me, they add a great deal of immersion. 
On the topic of the core gameplay loop; we have the battles. So are they good in this game? Yes. Never in total war's history has the battles of the game been more balanced, and about tactics rather than unit stats and special abilities, than they are in this game. Each clan have their strengths and weaknesses, but largely speaking their army rosters are almost the same, which might sound slightly boring, but actually creates a ton of balance to the battles, as they become more about how well you use your tropps than what troops have the biggest [strike] shlongs [/strike] err stats. 
All of this will only begin to scratch the surface, I haven't gone into the economics of the game which are a lot of fun too, or how it just might have the most beautiful art style of any TW game to date. 

So yeah if you like Total War and haven't tried this one yet, go for it, it's absolutely one of the best ones, and also it's DLC policy is nowhere near as atrocious as the later titles even if you still have to pay for blood effects... come on CA stop the greed please.",1650033628,1650033628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game seems to be working much better on 1440p monitors now and the Ui doesn't completely bug out on you, they must have fixed it finally. Much better now and worth a purchase. The blood DLC is still a disgrace but if you grab the whole collection on sale it might not be so bad. One of the better if not the best total war games , we shall see how Warhammer 3 ends up in a couple years. I'll leave the negative past review up so you can see how bad the game was and how pissed off I was at the game previously. At least the game works now, only thing that is missing is a screen lock button for your cursor. You will have to use a separate program for that, try ""dual monitor tools"". Alt tab and activate it then re-tab back into the game and it should stop it moving onto other monitors if you have any extra screens. 

Try it out and enjoy.

You need a million fixes to get this working these days, and I can barely get it fully functional at all. I had to; Use a screen resolution fix program, a mouse cursor lock program, had to go into the scripts and turn off screen resizing ( if you don't it becomes misaligned on windowed fullscreen). I then found out the ui scale is too large and is cut off on the bottom of the screen and there is no way of resizing it on a 2550 x 1440p monitor, so I don't understand why they have a windowed fullscreen mode if it doesn't work.
Honestly this is a disgrace for a game in 2019, I understand its an older game but I shouldn't have to work this hard for a game on a professional store front. If you aren't prepared to support the game so it at least works on modern hardware, take it off the store front. They are happy to take your money though, of course they are lol. Look at all the bullshit DLC you need for the game too. The fact that they still have the audacity to sell you ""blood effects"" for £2.50 is absolutely shameful and they still do it in newer titles too. 

If you report these problems on CA forums you are met with bullshit ""we know"" responses but never any fixes years later. There is nothing worse than patronising non answers, they obviously think customers are brain dead and beyond stupid. There's nothing more insulting. 
If you really want to try this game make sure you either play it on a 1080p monitor, or play it on fullscreen mode on a higher resolution. Playing on windowed fullscreen you will need to do a million fixes, and its not worth the trouble in my opinion, and it's all for nothing if you own any screen higher than 1080p. The UI doesn't scale well and it will have to look like total dog shit, so you can see all the ui elements.
 If you want to pick this up, for the love of god buy it on a 75% off summer sale or something, I can't stress that enough. It's titles like this make me regret supporting games altogether, the shear contempt they have for their own customers is a fucking joke. Just fix the game so I can play it properly and have positive things to say about it.",1576393161,1646632909,True,0,0,0.503703713417053223,0,True,False,False

Units seem ballanced and you can make use of all... (but in general ashigaru units are very srong for their cost... and hero unis are not as good as one would think... ye and also light cav can 1 vs 1  generals pretty easily)

[b] Style: [/b] It is a 2011 game and still looks really good, the style of the game and UI is just brilliant. Soundtrack is great.

[b] DLC: [/b] So you just need the [i] Sengoku Jidai Unit Pack [/i] to have the best experince, the ohers are not really necessary but most of them are nice addition (clan DLCs, more units DLCs) and [i] The rise of he samurai campaign DLC [/i] (not that good).
[i] The FALL of the samirai [/i] is now a ""sandalone game"" but it really is just a great expansion to the base game and i can recomend it, just a nice breath of fresh air and great gameplay.
But c'mon CA do you really have to chrge extra 2,99 € for the [i] Blood pack DLC [/i] ... stuff like this shold be in the base game

[b] Overall Great AI, nice graphics and style, cool units and  fun campaigns

The Shogun 2 TW is deservedly recognized as the most successful and beautiful historical strategy in the TW series.

Something to say first. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE OTHER CAMPAIGNS There are stand alone versions that you have to buy for one of the those campaign, they are not included in the base game. I Had trouble finding that.

Cons
1. Multiplayer achievements seem to be bugged as the part of multiplayer that holds the achievments seems to be bugged but you might be able to fix that, I did not try.
2. Some times placing and moving units is infuriating.
3. Some times ranged units are derpy and suicide run into the enemy.
4. Game cheats in a few unreasonable ways. Like spawning entire armies, as well as upgrading their units to max tier without even having the building to do so. This does make it more difficult but usually entirely playable.
5. A realm divided, is just kind of annoying, no matter how good of an ally you have been people just betray you. Again this is to make a challenge, but my opinion is. Ehhhh. why would you Backstab me....
6. Guns are not done well at all.
7. I still do not understand navy battles. 3 Total War Games in where Navy is present and I am still completely lost here.
8. The AI General spam is honestly stupid at times. Fighting an army that has Five ""Three star generals"" Embedded is an absolute joke

Pros.
Combat usually makes some sense.
Its fun.
Burning the Ikko Ikki with fire is cathartic.
Campaign Games can be short for a total war game, even as short as 2 hours, and it feels like you earned it.
Mods for anything that you do not like, or for what you want to add.
Breaks up the tedium of continually playing other Total War games.
Generals have a body guard, and can be taken out if they are in the middle of the fray, they also do not respawn magically if killed in battle
Is cheap. They actually gave the game out for free.

Would I say Shogun 2 is a ""Good Game"" No. but what They did wrong with Warhammer 1-2 They did right here. What they did wrong with Rome 2 They did right here. If you enjoy Total war games, it is a very nice reprieve from those two games.

Pro tips, Use Ahigaru/THE peasant units for most of your armies. It is how you are supposed to play unless you are filthy filthy rich.
Metsuke can get you an army of generals by bribing things.
Anime mods are great, Victory is for 10,000 years.

Wishes for if they ever make a third game. 
Fix whatever strange voodoo is on this games gun units.
Fix Artillery to be useful.
Add more provinces some places are straight up barren...

Shogun 2 has a simple premise- to choose a clan and retake the Shogunate for yourself. Japan is split enough to make it large, but not too large.

PROS
>Graphics 6.5/10, the over-world (map) is quite dated and the textures in-battle are dated. The UI's custom generals/troops/buildings icons are works of art.

>Gameplay 9.5/10, the opposite of ""dumb'd down"" Shogun 2 is in-depth having many ways to beat your opponent. Battle (Land/Sea), Diplomacy, Ninjas (Assassinate/Sabotage), Monks (Revolts/Rebels), Metsuke (Bribes/Anti Ninja). Role-play, Min-max, play the game how you want.

>Sound 9/10, Immersive, mostly drums and ""old"" sounding wood/wind instruments for the music. The guns/cannons have a satisfying ""Oomphf"", battle cries and sound effects are well made.

>Mods 8.5/10, New clans, in-game balance tweaks and more! I'm not a heavy mod user and mostly play vanilla, myself I've enjoyed Camera zoom extender, Further/Realistic gun range, and Play every empire (Ashikaga, Shoni, Ito, etc.).

+Good price, value for your money.

CONS
Heavy learning curve (well worth the effort), this may take you a couple hours to get your handle on how to win. You can however learn the gameplay in ""steps"" since there are many ways to win you can entirely avoid every aspect besides battling the enemy (happy to be proven wrong) until you are comfortable.

The battle AI isn't impressive, its just not that smart. The AI will attack without strategy ""throwing"" units at you or it will just hold areas without making any moves (defensive battles). You can quickly learn these patterns and win ""unwinnable"" battles. The campaign AI (over-world/map) is better than expected, The AI understands unit ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" and will build to defeat the player. The AI receives inflated income and will rely on a numbers advantage to overcome its battle AI weakness.

Dead multiplayer, the game is old. I don't know if there's a discord or similar for people to find player matches, I've had no luck finding randoms to battle however I only tried twice and waited 30 minutes of queue time.

DLC Blood pack.. really? The animations are not worth paying for.

SUMMARY, 33.5/40 (84%)

I enjoyed each hour of this game and I will recommend my friends to purchase.

One of the few Total War games that i can trully enjoy without the need of any mods, because of its high level of autenticity and historical accuracy in comparison with other TW tittles. 

- The time period and world zone both feel very refreshing as they barely have been touched by any other game before, even previous Total War games(with exeption of Shogun 1). 

- The art work/UI and music/sound are hands down some of the more immersive and better looking/sounding ones in the whole gaming industry in my opinion. Hell even the graphics still look great so many years after.

- The layout of the campaign map gives the AI a decent fighting chance... almost making it look as if it was competent. 

- The unit composition altough seemingly ""samy"" for all factions, make balance much less of an issue and still leaves a lot of room for diversity and customization(specially on multiplayer). 

- The inclusion of the RPG leveling system for agents and generals gives agency to the players and adds replayability.

- The Avatar Conquest multiplayer it's incredibly engaging and immersive giving each player an unprecedent level customization and personalization over his general, individual units and basicaly the whole army.

There is more to be said, but i think you get the idea... Shogun 2 does a lot of things very well and has an special charm that most Total War games(specially recent ones) fail to capture.

No game is not without flaws tho... most can be found in the multiplayer part of the game; i go over it's biggest flaws here:

I have played Medieval Two total war and enjoyed that so decided to give this a go since a friend of mine recommended it and I had somewhat knowledge of how total war worked.

But wow this game is such a unique experiance and I consider it one of my favourite games at the moment. At first I was finding it a hard to learn at first but you get good help from the tutorials and what you should expect the first time you do a battle or campaign.

The battles are amazing. Whilst requiring good concentration and skill to manage armies: you cannot help see the amazing detail and animations of each soldier murdering and charging into each other. It truly is beautiful chaos to watch.

The campaigns are excellent as well. Aspects such as realm divide and European traders keeps the experience unique and hard. I love each of the unique aspects of the factions and how each resource such as gold and blacksmiths are priority and you have to make tough decision on what province to capture next. Also the AI aren't stupid.

Overall, get this game. I think it is a very unique experiance and fantastic game. I'd truly say this is worth the time and investment.",1643493206,1643493206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Japanese map is nice, the research aspects and character customization is well designed.  Combat is fun with the usual warning that you don't advance any troops through your cannons because the heartless crew will just blow away our guys.  

Sea battles are fun and improved over earlier Total War games, still a bit slow but hey, it's the early age of steam.  Maybe ""Hollywood Tom"" adviser would be a nice add on.

Napoleon was quite similar and good. Rome II was also good and Warhammer. But somehow this one appealed to me most. I haven't played this in years so it's hard to remember exactly what it was. One of the key aspects was the fortification system and the balance between long range and short range units. Also, I think the upgrade system was pretty good if I remember correctly and the strategy layer was a good experience. I think the theme of Japan was also a nice aspect.

One problem with previous Total War games was lack of challenge after the hump, you know, the time when you beat your last major challenger and are now the dominant force on the map and that’s left to do is mop up everyone else. Shogun 2 doesn’t have that with the “realm divide” feature where the Shogun declares war on you and eventually everyone turns against you giving you a fight to survive and fight to win.

The largest criticism I have is Agent spam. I love the concept of agents but the fact that you can basically have 1 of each agent per town you control makes the spam get a little ridiculous. As an example one of the factions starts on an island and it was nearly impossible for me to attack them because as soon as my troops would land via Ships they would be surrounded by assassins, spy's, geisha's, and diplomats all ready to fuck my day up.

Shogun 2 has managed to evoke it's chosen time period better than any of the previous titles in the series. The first positives that stood out to me were the beautiful UI, and the soundtrack. Those are just the beginning - a cool campaign map awaits you, with a weather system, relaxing flute music, and unit cards that are LEGIBLE (and pretty). Plus, classic TW warfare.
The base game is solid on it's own, but I urge you to consider getting some of the DLC. I recommend Fall of the Samurai, which adds a second campaign with all new units and clans, and a shift in the time period. Coupled with that DLC, this game is a 10/10 for me.

Fort walls mean something here and I learned that the hard way, hell being able to hold a wall and not having navel bonbardment raining down on you is great. I would take the graphics of this game with the gameplay of it just to be able to shoot the cannons in WH 2. Navel battles needed refining but I have no idea why they removed em, like at best you'd just bump player's boat AI up to computer AI and have the palyer give general directions. 

I'm getting off topic, this game is good. Like crazy good. Sorry if you need shiny graphics but you are missing out on alot. Hell the sink kills are amazing, like it makes the battles look visceral and it makes getting up close worth it instead of bodies just exploding and flopping around.  Hell I'll probably pick up rome 2 remastered now cause this stuff is golden.

Oh and economic growth? Why did they drop that? what the fuck CA? 

Buy this over the modern stuff, I'm sorry its just better. No big stompy boys but sieges are worth it. like you have to be clever. and You can hold a fort with just a few guys against better odds and the forts are much better, and evolve when you upgrade em, turning into sprawling complexes of wall and fortifications.

Oh and seasons. no idea why they tossed that..... just more weirdness.

Oh and I'm playing on easy so I assume the AI gets a minor boost to give it an edge if you go higher. Just wow. 

Buy this instead of any modern game. or buy this after you've played one of their modern ones, and you just sit their and ask yourself ""What happened?""",1640278607,1640278607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good: The most accessible full-fledged Total War entry out there, easy to learn and difficult to master. TW:S is so fun to learn that it got me hooked onto Total War as a franchise! Great use of setting -- you'll want to read all about the Sengoku Jidai once you get into this game. Fantastic soundtrack that fits right into the setting -- so good that you wouldn't ever suspect it was written by some white guy in Australia! Its expansion, Fall of the Samurai, is a perfectly executed 180 turn from how the base game plays and will again suck you right in for even more hours. 

Funny: The in-game announcer. His cheesy faux-Japanese accent is an unintentionally goofy contrast to the formal-sounding Japanese spoken by your formations of troops. ""Our men are running from the battlefield -- a shamefur dispraaaay!"" 

Bad: The same mechanics that make TW:S accessible are also responsible for it lacking depth compared to other TWs. Longtime TW players liken TW:S gameplay to a rock-paper-scissors style of combat when played by competent commanders. Also, TW:S's infamous endgame mechanic (""realm divide"") was polarizing to the TW fan base in 2011 and remains polarizing to this day for being inelegantly implemented.

-Graphics are just stunning.

-A.I is really dumb
-Requires a pretty hefty machine to get the fullest out of the game.

I was able to apply an adaptation of Napoleons strategy of concentrated force across the campaign and tactical map to effectively fight on 2 fronts. Front 1 being the defensive front slowing the enemy in a war of attrition or outright crushing them in a decisive defensive battle opening them for a potential counter attack. Front 2 being the offensive front focusing on isolating enemy armies from their castles defeating them in the field and depending on the situation forcing capitulation through diplomacy or taking the territory for my own. This strategy allows me to defeat enemies on the offensive front who are similar or greater in power. I have found the most success with this strategy playing as the Oda Clan as their cheap high quality levy allow me to tie down and outmaneuver stronger samurai warriors and though each general commands a force smaller than the enemies 20 stack when fighting together they can overwhelm the enemy through sheer force of numbers. You just have to give zero fucks about how many peasants die. As each turn goes by you feel a sense of satisfaction at seeing your faction incrementally grow in power with each victory but the game moves at a pace where as the AI's power scales with your own thus always challenging you to some degree.

Though in saying that they managed to sabotage thier own work. People may recently think the spltting of the Fall of the Samurai DLC to a game of its own was bad but let me remind you. When that actual DLC dropped it corrupted and changed the look of the base game. This was the second stealth graphical  downgrade since E3`s night battles demo. They corrupted the gloss and various textures. If you look at the avatar faces and see how aliased and rough they look that was not like this before Fall of the Samurai.

Even after all the anti consumer tactics by CA, Even after two downgrades and one partial fix to tey to restore the graphics it is still my favourite in the entire series and i recommend you buy everything inc all DLC apart from blood.

The music is amazing, the lore gathered is really awesome and the sieges and combat are among the most fun I’ve had in a long while. Even the “lack” of unit diversity can be easily ignored by how the game plays and each faction encourages certain playstyles based on your starting location and bonuses.

For me, the main downsides of the game are 1) The rise of the Samurai DLC which feels really lackluster, more so because the amount of stacks the enemy can push is astounding and, 2) The general speeches which seem bizarre.

Watching individual units fight, how they move, dodge, counter or even using martial arts in some instances are among the most entertaining things you can do in this game. More so if you slow down the action by half.

On top of that there's countless sound errors that keep popping up as the game seems to become more and more unstable every time I get a new computer. I dearly enjoy Shogun 2 and believe it is one of the best games in the series with FOTS being my all-time favorite entry in Total War. The issue therein lies in the fact that it seems to endlessly become more unstable the more time drifts on and hardware evolves beyond it. 

The battles are tons of fun and the gunfighting is a very unique experience compared to most total war games. The maps are very fun to play with and well designed, and a lot of the mechanics, although straightforward in nature, have massive potential.

The only gameplay problem is the issue with AI agents killing off your entire army and ending the campaign instantly as there is no real way to counter them, even with your own agents at high levels. Even if that wasn't the case it is a horrible mechanic and is entirely luck based.
If I have to quit a campaign and restart because the AI spams a dozen agents that destroy my entire army over the course of a single turn then its just not worth playing the campaign
The fact that one of the primary selling points of the game, the campaign, simply relies on mods to fix the game randomly breaking and becoming unplayable/unwinnable is absurd. 
As of writing this review none of the no-agent mods seem to work with vanilla or overhauls which just adds up to like 30 hours of wasted time getting halfway through the campaign before the AI basically console commands your armies away.",1635713488,1635713488,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

It is always welcoming and still looks relatively modern despite its age. Whether you want to have fun with your friends or just spend a quiet night playing by yourself, Shogun 2 has got you covered.

Multiplayer has many options: you can play the campaign with your friends, play competetively in Avatar conquest or just play an all-out slugfest with a group of friends and almost unlimited Koku (the currency in this game) at your disposal.

Single player has you either going to medieval ages and clashing your swords against other upstart clans or going to more modern times, fighting the short and much-forgotten Boshin War where imperial armies clashed against the more traditional forces.

Not many games have this much content to offer. An all of it it deep, balanced and well thought out. I mean, there's even an encyclopedia embedded into the game which offers you not only information on how things work, but also gives historical context of why this is in the game.

But, I can also see some of the things that made it go down hill, and kind of foreshadowed the things I despise about newer total wars. I do recommend the game for multiplayer battles, and maybe campaign. The campaign is fun, but, instead of making a seemingly smart AI (which is possible), they just made it so the AI doesn't play by your rules. So, in reality, not only is the AI really, genuinely stupid, but, the only way to beat the AI is really throwing your troops into the samurai meat grinder, and other ways that don't always make sense. For instance, pike and shot is a pain in the ass. Don't do it. But, wanna full sprint your guys into a line of arrows or gun fire? Be CA's guest apparently. It feels like many of the tactics in the game are based off of ""Me unit more expensive! Me unit charge now!"" Which I will get to now actually.
Another thing that's a big pain is the fact that unit experience doesn't seem to matter. In medieval 2, if you upgraded a unit of spear militia or even just town militia to the max, they could be most normal spear sergeants. Get them max experience, max weapon upgrades, and max armour upgrades; they beat any spear sergeants that don't have those upgrades sheerly because of that experience. It makes it seem like experience matters, and there's a reason to not only care about your troops, but, also keep them around. In Shogun 2, like many total war games after it, unit XP doesn't seem to matter. You can recruit a fresh unit of bow samurai with no xp, and they'll beat loan sword or yari ashigaru that have max experience with ease. Yet, these ashigaru, despite being peasants, have won numerous battles. And, four units of them are bested by a bunch of guys who were just given their armour, bows, and swords five minutes ago. It seems like most units win because they're priced higher, and not because they genuinely have battle experience. It's the problem I have with Rome 2, and many other total war game. Not matter how experienced a unit gets, it will never best any unit that's higher priced than it. And, that to me takes away from the good of the game.
However, in some cases there are reasons to care about your troops. They cost A LOT of money, even if the game says you'll get them cheaper. Food does seem to be a problem, but, only because it doesn't let you upgrade. If you have the money, feel free to not feed your troops. But, the AI doesn't have this problem. So, if you can't upgrade, guess what? They will. Because the AI wasn't given an economy. 
The battles do feel nice, and very visceral when you do fight them. Even though tactics in the game don't fully make sense, it's still enjoyable to watch. Especially if you're the type of person who just spams out people waves. Because, if you can get the money to do it, it will work. The game's moral system seems to not like troops being outnumbered. So, even if that unit of bow samurai can take out four units of maxed out yari ashigaru by itself, if you have four armies worth of them, that doesn't matter. And, that to be is both a big problem, but, is also perfectly balanced, and not exploitable at all.
The game is genuinely fun, and it feels so good. But, it goes from rock, paper, scissors mechanics to, ""My rock shinier than your rock. My rock win. Ogga Booga."" And, it does this very quickly. You cannot rely on the peasant wall tactic, even if your peasant wall has all maxed out XP. Because, it will still die unless you have three other armies supporting said peasant wall. And, that's both a good, and bad thing. 

Now for a not so lengthy conclusion:
The game is fun. And, I do recommend you play it. I did say a lot of bad about it, but, it's still a decent total war game. But, be warned of the things I've talked about, or it will ruin the game for you. It really sincerely will.",1633245440,1633245440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the best game I have played in a long while. It's great for beginners in the series. It was my first Total war game and it have gave me 100's of hours of entertainment. If you want to play as a religious zealot you can covert your people to Christianity and enlighten your countrymen to the ways of the Gaijin. If not you can continue the ways of the old and use bows and swords to carve out a place in history.

Gun
Fun
spies
fall of the samurai
Nanban trade shiips
chaad yari ashigaru
Cons
Getting your metsuke killed by some crazy lvl 3000 spy
Sometimes it crash randomly 
rise of the samurai is a bit boring
weak hero units

But now and then I go to a party, get drunk, and the next morning I can’t for the life of me remember what I did with it. First I looked around my apartment, and I couldn’t find it. So I called up the place where the party was; they hadn’t seen it either
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet, ‘cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes, but not this time
So, I told them if it pops up to let me know. I called a few people who were at the party, but they were no help either
I was starting to get desperate. I really don’t like being without my penis for too long; it makes me feel like less of a man, and I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak. After a few hours of searching the house and calling everyone I could think of, I was starting to get very depressed. So I went to the Kiev, and ate breakfast. Then, as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark’s Place, where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street, I saw my penis lying on a blanket next to a broken toaster oven. Some guy was selling it–I had to buy it off him. He wanted twenty-two bucks, but I talked him down to seventeen. I took it home, washed it off and put it back on. I was happy again. Complete.

People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached, but I don’t know–even though sometimes it’s a pain in the ass, I like having a detachable penis.

I see some people having problems with FoTS, it is a standalone game but you need the original shogun 2 to launch it because it is deemed as a DLC. If you bought FoTS first, steam will not allow you to buy acquire shogun 2 as they think that you already have it (?) That's what i saw in the reviews anyways so be mindful.

The battles.
This is where Shogun 2 REALLY shines. To keep it simple, it's like a card game where specific units beats specific units while it being vulnerable to yet another specific units.
For example; The Yari (spear) units are vulnerable to Katana units, Katana units are vulnerable to Cavalry units, and Cavalry units are vulnerable to Yari units.
But of course, there are WAY MORE units out there with their specific role, combine the perfect army composition and make full use of the terrain around the battlefield. Be it a castle, river, bridge or maybe just a single hill will change the tide of battle.

The Campaign 
Now this is the part where it falls slightly. The Campaign feels slightly a bit bland after a few campaign runs. I've played as the Shimazu, Oda, Takeda and the Date. Currently trying the Uesugi. While the politics system is indeed good, using a ""relationship points"" sort of way, 
""It's like every clan you first meet wants you dead"" -The Shogunate

Politics in shogun 2 can be a bit tiring, especially after the realm divide. It's a system where your clan has overtaken the Shogunate, or is deemed the enemy of the state by the Shogun. You think your vassals and long time Allies will support you in this glorious Campaign of Japan? No. They turn their backs on you.. and it hurts :(.    
Though after you became Shogun, that is to take Kyoto for a whole year (4 turns/seasons) All your NEWLY made vassals will not turn their backs on you.

And to top the Cons off, the game is VERY mod-able. 

This completely negates all the bad things in this game, except for a few bugs which imo doesn't have a huge impact.

The DLC.
The DLC is fun I suppose, such as the Clan packs having special traits to them. The Sengoku Jidai pack and the saints and heroes DLC just adds a couple of new units, but it will definitely improve the fun for sure.
Now the blood pack, kiss my A##. Do you really need to spend money to add things like BLOOD and decapitation?

I mean it's up to you really, but it still boggles me on why would you need to spend money for blood... I suppose wait for a sale? It's up to you.

To sum it up, I absolutely recommend shogun 2 to you, it has pulled me into an interest in learning more about Japan's history, it's very enjoyable both in an Arcady way and a Semi-Realistic way. Though if you don't like strategy game like I do, maybe you won't like it that much but I personally do. I'd give this game a solid 9/10.",1631036713,1631036713,True,14,1,0.67092430591583252,0,True,False,False

If you feel like you need to punish yourself or you want a challenge, than go ahead and buy it.

If you decide to play this game, here are a number of tips:

- SAVE OFTEN (pretty much before EVERY decision i mean EVERY decision)
- WATCH YOUR GLOBAL FOOD LEVEL (if you mess that up you'll most likely have to start over)
- BUILD A STRONG NAVY (if you want it or not, it is necessary to secure key strategic points and not get 
  invaded...yes INVADED)
- WATCH YOUR GENERALS LOYALTY (if it drops to 1 disband him!)
- YOU WILL PLAY MOST OF THE GAME ON THE CAMPAIGN MAP (get used to it)

And lastly:
- S A V E  O F T E N  !!!!111

The game still sucks mostly (crashes here and there) and it WILL NOT take you by the hand.
Meaning the strategy map tutorials are useless and you'll have to learn everything that is important on your own. Now this can be fun, if that is what you are looking for. However i am sick and tired of the fact that SW-DEVs (and producers) 1.) do not seem to understand simple UI-design guidelines and 2.) seemingly have no structure throughout their feature designs (i.e.  1.) simple popup messages if you save 2.) no popup or confirm message if you are moving your pawns around). The number of times i had to reload because the pawn was running in the wrong direction or i did not know a certain feature, that when triggered completely messes up your game to the point where you have no choice BUT to restart.

And the list goes on...

@DEVs: Add tutorials for the part of the game the player actually spends most of their time with i.e. the campaign map.",1629791399,1629935641,False,0,0,0.430463552474975586,0,True,False,False

I kind of hate Shogun 2. I've been playing Total War games since the demo disc for the first Shogun in PC Gamer, way back when--I fell in love immediately. And Shogun 2 is, arguably, the very best entry in the franchise. It's good. Really, really good. Phenomenally good. And the Fall of the Samurai expansion allows us to experience the surprisingly-engaging gunpowder-age combat introduced in Empire, while still retaining the fantastic traditional medieval combat in the base game. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect--naval combat is a bit of a mess, diplomacy is as wonky as ever, and the lack of the throne room or any similar roleplay-style systems is a bit disappointing. But it's still one of the best strategy games out there--nevermind among the best looking.

But, see, Shogun 2 isn't simply the best Total War game out there--it's also the last good Total War game out there. It's the one game by which every subsequent Total War is judged, and they invariably fall far, far, far short. It's really depressing, honestly. I'm sitting here, writing this, desperately hoping the upcoming Three Kingdoms will finally buck this trend (after all, Shogun 2's brilliance came after Empire's catastrophe) but I am not optimistic.",1301004967,1629827475,True,11,2,0.641549408435821533,0,True,False,False

The Samurais fighting is the most satisfying thing to see in total war and the combat animations are unheard of.
This game provides such a learning curve in contrast to its predecessor, Napoleon Total War where you stand in a line and murder everyone with guns. Even on normal you may experience some difficulties maintaining provinces and realm divide is absolutely hardcore. Guns are improved from Napoleon in Fall of the Samurai, the best DLC total war ever had, fall of the samurai provides a different experience than shogun 2. The naval battles is significantly improved from napoleon as well. Couldn't find as much fun in shogun 2s successors.

34330,91620867,76561198262859750,15,2,3186,0,769,1627786372,"Pros
The game itself is very good. Swords and guns require a fair amount of manuvering, and one wrong click can mean you lose like 50/200 soldiers just instantly to a hail of gunfire. Cannons have a huge range, and could be OP, but are fun to shoot from 1st person.

Cons
Straight melee can be useless when fighting entrenched gunners. Sword units can be pretty much obsolete, since you can just rotate gunner units until victory. Honestly a battle can feel like a lot of skirmishs, a lot of sitting, watching bullets fly, moving, and repeating. There isn't very often the super satisfying charge of melee or horse units into each other, that you get in other games.

BIGGEST CON
This game is super buggy. For the record, I play on an early 2015 Macbook Air, which is listed to work. However, any time I exit full screen I get the tutorial book open with no way to close. Any time a screen time notification comes up, the game freezes. Ordering units around usually has to be done 1 at a time, since group positioning of lots of units at once leads to some unusual decisions.One could think of this as untrained soldiers not following orders, but often each set of commands I give, requires a full pause, me ordering each unit individually, and pausing every 30 seconds to repeat.

A lot of this wouldn't matter if you could save during battles. However, the historical battles are like an hour long on all normal speed, and more often than not, it's the AI making it's own decisions, and my units die of incompetence. That leads to having to start the whol battle over again.

Overall, I think this is a fun game, but you need way better hardware, and very good micro control.

20 hr update: If you get the frozen tutorial book open, do the three fingers up, to move the program to a new desktop, with the frozen tutorial windows somewhere else. The top inch of your screen is cut off, but at least you can finish the level.

57 hr update: Beat short campaign. Fun game. Needs above workarounds to be functional, but once you have that, it's nice.",1620440328,1627786195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's worth watching some YouTube videos to truly master the game. The tutorials only guide you on how to move units around the battlefield, but you won't learn battlefield tactics like ""Hammer and Anvil"" or ""Bait and Switch"" unless you take the time to study it a little.

Battle maps are a thrill with thousands of units and mechanics to learn and utilise to minute casualties and ensure victory - winning an uphill battle is fantastic feeling.

So farm only depends on how much plain area a province have. And market consumes food instead of creates squalor. And in FoTS it's simply generates money and modernize the faction. There's not enough unique traits and or units to actually change your strategy in campaign. And AI not taking advantage of clan strength or trying to be the first clan with gunpowder or monk units doesn't help either.

The multiplayer avatar is a nice touch. Realm divide is something that is unique to this game that keeps it interesting. Trying out converting to christian is always fun.  Despite its age it's beautiful looking still. And FoTS was such a refresh, there's mix of the old and modern units, naval bombardments, train tracks, gatling gun, torpedo boats and ironclads.

I was excited to see rifles being used in a strategy game like this, but their range is so short that it looks like they wanted to nerf them for balancing to keep melee and bow units relevant, but that just defeats the purpose of even including rifles. The animations for the riflemen is missing, and the sounds of the rifles firing is awful, with one of the sounds being the same as the M1 Carbine from Day of Defeat.

There's other missing or unfinished animations throughout the game, as if they gave up at some point, yet still wanted to try to sell a bunch of DLC which is advertised on the menu. The riflemen shoot too far to the sides of a regiment because they're all aiming for the enemy soldier right at the ends of the line. Sometimes Gatling cannons show an animation of firing when ordered to, but they don't fire - I've only been able to get half of them to fire, and the ones that do fire don't need reloading.

There's features that seemed more annoying than fun, like camera shake that can't be disabled, an attrition mechanic where your soldiers instantly start dying when away from home. Apparently units can change sides, although I didn't enjoy playing long enough to see it, it sounds like it defeats the point of strategy games if your units just join the enemy.

The program doesn't want to minimise. From a battle you can't get to the main menu, and the menu is very graphically intense and takes ages to load, so it's annoying having to finish every battle and then have to wait for the menu to load each time. The historical battles and naval battles left a poor impression. The campaign map honestly looks like trash. Campaign missions distract from the gameplay and make little sense.

You can't stop a friendly unit from joining a battle as reinforcements. Campaign tips have to be closed by clicking a button, but moving the mouse to it moves the camera away from Japan, making a lot of early gameplay more frustrating than it needs to be. The savegames are hidden away in C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Shogun2\save_games

Trying the campaign on easy, and the enemy units were so overpowered that it's basically lost in the first turn - campaigns are supposed to go on for about 150 turns. Sieges are dull, units can barely move within fortifications, and a lack of siege weapons makes them unbearable.

After logging 1,000 hours in [i]Empire[/i] I thought this would improve on it, but it just felt like a bad mod that remains expensive a decade later at £24.99 and another £31.92 for the DLC. It still lacks a lot of animations, and rather than fix it (or even fix the memory leak in [i]Empire[/i]) they just kept making shallow DLC.",1625168164,1625168181,False,0,2,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

Mechanics are fairly tight, graphics are pretty, and battles feel fairly well balanced even on legendary which is what I typically play. However, it lacks robust siege battles and unit diversity. One of the things I think this game has going for it is that all factions will more or less have the same units available to them, which means more emphasis is put on tactics and strategy. With mods like expanded japan, new units, and fortresses of the samurai, it feels like a whole new game. Beautiful fort layouts make for interesting and far more involved siege battles. New unit types add diversity and new cost/benefit analyses to recruitment that the AI also makes full use of. Expanded Japan adds dozens of new clans and provinces, and it doesn't make the campaign map feel cluttered or like it balloons the difficulty. On legendary difficulty, with the total mod package, it is a tense and rewarding experience. Your moves need to be planned carefully, and you can't rely on simply having better troops than your enemies. In fact you will often need to win with inferior soldiers. Expanding without leaving yourself open feels like playing a game of chess. The mid and late games don't fall off like they do for me in other TW games.

Melee is as in most of these games kina shit, the charges are good but as soon as the actual melee starts it devolves into blobs that resolve everything through kill moves, there is an invisible dice roll and then one of the infantry models either dies or plays a fancy draw animation. The animations themselves are good but its so tedious to have to sit through what is essencially a shit load of auto resolves. Units cannot gang up on a single target its all duels unless you are charging. Of course you can skewer these stats and can tip the balance of said duels on your side by outnumbering, exausting and outflaking the enemy and its still nowhere near as bad as empire or rome 2 was so that is at least a big plus. Its a bad system but its the best version of said bad system
Ranged combat. Now here we have the best part of the warscape engine, Bullets fly fast and hit hard, all the gun sound effects are flaccid but the bullets and impact sounds are good. If you pause the game you can see each individual projectile as they fly though the air and when that son of a bitch lands it can stop anyone dead in his tracks. Arrows and artillery are also the best they have been in the total war series, there is something magical about watching your men pull back those bow strings and bury entire infantry lines under  a hail of arrows. You get to really feel the force of those arrows when they bury themselves in whatever poor son of a bitch happens to be on the other side, shame japs never got behind the concept of shields.
Cav, unline the old games they lack the mass they used to have and they also blob rather hard but the devs have gone into great lengths to lessen those problems, when you create a wedge as an example your men will actually divide entire units in two and after they split them up start moping them up and chop them to bits while they are in dissaray, there is still no unit collision but they fake it quite well.
Navy. I dont have much to say as i tend to avoid naval combat in all its forms and all the games that has boats but its surprisingly enjoyable, from shogun 2 to fall of the samurai naval combat is not that bad. Shogun 2 rewards micro management and positioning because when your men are still stuck with bows and matchlocks your angle of attack can be the difference between a lot of wasted arrows and alot of enemy dead crew men. In fall of the samurai micro still matters as a good co-ordinated broadside that punches through the hull of a steamboat has a big change to cause a huge explosion as the ammo goes off killing everything around it, Good fucking stuff.
Diplomacy, Its as good as its going to get for a total war game, you can do fancy stuff like arranged marriages between houses, you can create alliances that will last for more than 5 rounds and force others to break alliances with their neigbours so you can double team them, you can forcefully spread your ideology/ religion in your neighbours to make them easier to conquer in the future and the AI unlike empire kina makes sense in its demands. Good stuff like that.
DLC is cancer but it its nothing compared to CA's current DLC policy so i cant complain much. In fact on a sale you can buy shogun 2, its two expansions and all its DLC for the price of a single DLC of total war warhammer and that says a fucking lot.
I am not even going to mention how many mods you can slap over this badboy to many what is already an great total war game even better, i will leave that up to you to figure out on your own.",1622030453,1622030453,True,9,2,0.593979775905609131,0,True,False,False

The AI is inconsistent, sometimes hilarious, often times competent and sometimes actually suprisingly resourceful and inventive with it's tactics.
