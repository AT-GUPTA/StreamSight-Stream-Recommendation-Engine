I spent 15 whole dollars on this shit just to get spat on and kicked in the teeth for almost 30 consecutive hours. But like a sad desperate dog I just keep crawling back to get abused again and again. I was so proud of myself for finally beating the game, before I learned that I had to beat the game another 10 FUCKING TIMES TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS. You can't just let me feel good about myself, I beat your damn game what more do you want from me. Fine whatever, I'll put even more hours of my time and energy into this pile of shit, how hard can it be? (It's actually not hard at all once you unlock Azazel). So finally, I get to the final final boss, It Lives, and I kill it. Everything is right in the world, everything is beautiful, I've done it, I can finally rest. Oh but no, the game proceeded to fuck me even harder when I realized that the game had barely even started. 27 HOURS INTO THE GAME AND I HAD BASICALLY JUST BEATEN THE PROLOGUE, THE WARM UP, THE PRACTICE ROUND. Oh and of course I couldn't forget the fact that since this game is a roguelike, YOU HAVE TO START AT THE VERY BEGINNING EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME. IF I WANT TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS GODDAMN GAME, THIS GOD FORSAKEN HEAP OF TRASH, THIS GROTESQUE PIECE OF GARBAGE THAT CONTINUES TO FESTER IN MY STEAM LIBRARY, I HAVE TO BEAT THE WHOLE FUCKING PROLOGUE ALL OVER AGAIN. OH AND NOW THE FINAL BOSS IS EVEN HARDER NOW, SO YIPPEE. Yeah anyways fuck this game, don't buy it, save yourself, it's not worth it. Please for the love of god leave while you still can, get out, run, play something actually fun. Enjoy nature, be with your family, work on your career, do literally anything other than waste your time in this digital hellscape. 


(Ok now jokes aside, here are my actual thoughts on the game)

10/10 game, my favorite roguelike, period, end of statement. This game is absolutely perfect for passing time in class, or in the library, or just at home when you're chilling and want something fun to do. I love how each run is fairly short (Can range from 15 minutes to an hour in order to beat the game. However once you get good your runs start to go by a whole lot faster), and you can save your game and leave in the middle of a run pretty much anytime. It's a lot of fun to hop in and beat a stage or 2 while I'm waiting for something, and it gives me something to do other than doomscroll on social media so yeah. Plus it brings back a ton of memories from school when I'd mess around on cool math games and stuff with my friends in class. The art style and gameplay is super simplistic, however the gameplay becomes extremely dynamic when you learn more about the items and the synergies and different strategies. The game has a super simple premise, escape the basement by killing monsters and avoid getting hit. However the sheer amount of items and room generations and enemy types and bosses makes every run feel totally random and unique. The best randomly generated map since fucking Minecraft and I mean that. Just like every new world in Minecraft feels unique, each basement feels totally different, and the random generation helps to keep you on your toes and add a ton of diversity in the way you approach each run. 

Oh and don't even get me started on the art style and religious symbolism. The art style is super lighthearted and comedic, but it's utilized to produce a lot of gory imagery and convey heavy themes of religious trauma. I love this strategy, because on the surface the game appears to be a goofy little adventure with a slightly traumatized protagonist, nothing new, and nothing super interesting. However the more you play and the deeper you like into the different characters, bosses, items, etc. it becomes more and more clear what this story is really about. I'm obviously not gonna give a lore breakdown here, I think it's best digested through playing the game and discovering it on your own. If you don't feel like dissecting the lore of the game yourself though, there are plenty of Youtube videos that will do it for you, so search away. What I will say though, is that this game portrays a beautiful story about heartbreak, family dynamic, and struggles with ones identity and religious trauma. It's a story that could hit close to home for a lot of people who struggle especially with religion and how it effects oneself and others around you. I know this story struck a chord with me, and I see many fragments of myself in Isaac (the protagonist) as well. I think there are pieces of Isaac in many of us, and this story can serve as a way to help us understand ourselves a little better as well. Oh also if you haven't read the Bible already, pllleeeease do. I'm not religious, I think that you're incredible and beautiful whether or not you choose to believe in the Bible. But regardless, it's such a good book full of incredible stories and mythology. It's crazy to see how a book written so long a go has so many stories that can be compared to modern day events and experiences. I think The Binding of Isaac is a great example of how a story from the Bible could manifest itself in our contemporary experiences. Even if you don't wanna go through and read the Bible cover to cover, I do strongly recommend reading the story of Isaac from the Bible before playing this game. You can find it in the book of Genesis, chapter 22. Again, I'm not trying to be a bible thumper by any means, I just love biblical theology :)

So yeah, if you're like me and you love flash games, roguelikes, fantasy violence, cute and funny art, and religious themes, this game is a MUST HAVE. Even if you're not a fan of the story, the gameplay is competent on it's own, and the story isn't in your face or crammed down your throat, so you can just overlook it if you really want to (Although you'd be missing out on a lot lmao). And I'll probably be back for another review after I've beaten the game another hundred or so times LMAOOOO",1708679901,1708680109,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Its by far my favourite game.
I only got tired of playing it when I had to grind for a few specific Achievements cause I figured (after 2000+ hours) that it was time for me to complete the game.

I know its not for everyone but it has infinite playtime, amazing plot & great sound design so it is 1000% worth buying. I am trying to find similar games to complete but it feels like a goose chase. None of them are able to reach this game. Its truly unique

If you're new and/or late to the franchise like I am, I would suggest committing to Rebirth more than the base game. It's essentially and upgraded version of the first one. If you want more challenges, items, bigger rooms, more enemies/bosses improved QOL, then this version of Isaac is for you! 

There are plenty of things to do in this version. You have challenges, more characters to choose from AND it's local multiplayer. Stay tuned though as I heard a beta for online multiplayer is out for its DLCs.

R R R R R R for some time and you get a lottery ticket. A winning one if you get Tech X, and only that. Epic Fetus might be one, but I've only gotten it 3 times ever, so whatever, it's not really IN the game. Book of Revelations is literally the only way to win on ???. How to improve this game to a sideway thumb? Give me a starting item of my choice. That's it! The hours (!) I have to waste on R-ing are literally a waste of time and good fundamental gameplay! Oh, and some bosses are wayyyy too hard, and that goes from the very first level to the final bosses. Balancing is non-existent in this game. What would force the developer to actually balance the game? GIVING ME A STARTING ITEM OF MY CHOICE...

EDIT:
No flaws of the original game have been tackled at all (other than the fact you can see your stats now, and the white fly nerf. Thank Satan for that. Large rooms are also a decent addition. I really don't like the 12 hearts hard cap though). Like I surmised beforehand, this is just bigger. Risk vs reward still isn't a thing. It's just reset reset reset til you get a good starting item (and it's 20 times that in Greed mode...) – some of them are so strong (like e.g. Tech X or Ludovico) that I've literally never lost a run when I got them (and I'm right now at roughly 1/3 of achievements). This aspect gets more important the further you go, as you need to pack quite some damage/health to be able to defeat the end bosses. Some other items are so piss-poor (aptly called cursed) it's a reset when you accidentally pick them up! Oh and you're still not told what items do. You literally have to look everything up in the wiki, and with all the interactions even more than before (what OP item overrides which, for example).

Now this game can still be fun when you get OP as fuck and unlock a new thing (granted, most unlocks are complete shit). But the frustration outweighs. And the scope of the game is also its biggest flaw. What, I have to literally defeat each and every boss again in hard mode this time? Thanks for not telling me that beforehand – actually not telling me that EVER. This is a thumb down as hard as they go. The original was a masterpiece for the sheer concept of the game, which is genius, but just like this remake, playing these games literally is losing. The gaming equivalent of smoking cigarettes. There's one exception to what I said though – the 100% speedrun, real time attack. That's literally the ultimate speedrun there is, a feat akin to e.g. the Race across America, and as far as I know, nobody has ever recorded it. (Note that I d0 consider speedrunning to be one of the dumbest things man has ever come up with – but the ultimate of something IS the ultimate.)

And as I correctly assumed beforehand, the fundamental flaws from the original game haven't been improved upon here whatsoever. This is just much larger (and winning thus even more random).

After this bull that just happened, I see no more reason to play this game. It's a fraud. There's nothing to win here, but everything to lose. I can learn nothing more here

PS: some hundreds of hours later... you may scratch everything above, and there are still so many unforgivable things in this one. e.g. mistakenly going down the wrong hole or another when going for Mother (aka the shitty path with the hardest boss in the end), killing a surefire run. has happened to me some 5 to 10 times now. one time would not be acceptable. or getting hit on static spikes when you've already fully cleared a whole floor. or not getting a single key drop on basement 2 even when doing both secret rooms!!! that's like e.g. Excel saved only every other time you clicked save, and crashed the other one. that's a thumb down in a can. praise this guy for trying to make a genre-defining classic, but fuck him for making so many damn unforgivable mistakes while doing so.

PPS: when I have a couple of hours of free time, I don't ""play"" Isaac. I RESET RUNS in Isaac. that's how bad it is

PPPS: and now I never have to play a ??? character in an Isaac game again and wonder (to myself) what to call it. that's a fucking relief!",1687827025,1708475872,False,0,1,0.31055903434753418,1,True,False,False

A lot of the items are godsends but most of them tend to be either situational, terrible in general, or outright worse than other items with the exact same functions. A lot of characters are fun to play with like Bethany, Isaac, or a few alternate characters, but some fall flat and are more of a challenge than the items you unlock with them are worth. The music is creepy and unsettling given its story, but most of the time it’s forgettable with only a few standout ones out of it. The enemies and bosses are totally bull crap sometimes especially on hard mode, because a giant chunk of enemies are either bulky, attack you in hard to dodge ways, can only be attacked at a specific time, or just spawn even more enemies while they run away. The bosses can be unique at times with different ways to fight them, but most are just reskins of earlier bosses with different attack patterns, so some do fall a little short. Overall, it’s not a perfect game, but it’s a fun game that I find myself often coming back to.",1708473869,1708473869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The replayability on this is insane, I haven't had a single run that felt the same - layouts, bosses, rooms, enemies and most importantly items change every run drastically. I also do not feel that it is necessarily as hard as some feedback suggests; even on hard mode there will be games that you absolutely steamroll.

One issue I have is that the number of items can also feel quite overwhelming, as there are many items which are obviously useless or are effect-wise a copy of another item. I think finding a useless item at start makes it difficult to not reset, knowing how good some other items are.

I would welcome some sort of internal item database (e.g. like the Encyclopedia mod) to limit the reliance on the external databases (i.e. platinumgod), as I still go there at least once per run since I often obtain items I have never seen before. At the same time, I guess that alt-tabbing and navigating in any sort of ingame database wouldn't differ much in terms of how much time it saves, so it's not that big of a deal.",1619259942,1708424959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1708351529,1708351529,True,24,4,0.550938546657562256,0,True,False,False

What sets The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth apart is its unique blend of roguelike elements and dungeon-crawling action. Every playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable, with procedurally generated levels, a vast array of items and power-ups, and a wide variety of enemies and bosses to encounter.

One of the things I love most about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is its sheer depth and replayability. With hundreds of items to discover, each with its own unique effects and synergies, no two runs are ever the same. The game rewards experimentation and strategy, encouraging players to try out different combinations and playstyles to survive the horrors that await.

But beyond its addictive gameplay, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth also tells a compelling and deeply personal story. The themes of trauma, religion, and redemption are woven into the game's narrative and symbolism, adding layers of depth and meaning to Isaac's journey through his own twisted subconscious.

The game's art style and sound design further enhance the experience, creating a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere that draws players deeper into Isaac's unsettling world. From the grotesque enemies to the haunting soundtrack, every aspect of the game is meticulously crafted to immerse players in its dark and surreal universe.

In conclusion, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a masterpiece of indie game design that has earned its place as a modern classic. Its challenging gameplay, deep mechanics, and atmospheric storytelling make it a must-play for fans of roguelikes and dungeon crawlers alike. If you're looking for a game that will keep you coming back for more, look no further than The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. It's a dark and addictive gem that will leave you craving just one more run.",1640856677,1708322149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are many more characters to unlock than the game tells you can unlock if you have the DLCs. I highly recommend buying all DLCs because each adds more content, stores, and items. Repentance is the last and final DLC. This finished the game's story. There is making a board game that expands the lore. Another game expands the lore, too.

This game turns into a walking sim where you need to run over and pick up hearts just to run back all the way to sacrifice health which will waste so much time. Thank goodness for the great mods which are the one saving grace. Also flash art style better and why does it take them so many years for online coop?

Basically, the grandfather of modern roguelites. Brought a lot of elements from the roguelites of yore and somehow managed to reintegrate it with a nice polish and interesting enough storyline (all the endings) while managing to leave quite a bit of room for interpretation as well. 

A lot of items and a lot of synergies between items ensure that not a lot (and I mean it) runs will look or feel the same. The extensive roster of characters also helps with suitable playstyles for everyone depending on the character chosen and in turn the items found. 

Quite a few end-game bosses with branching paths for a bit of challenge as well. While one of the bosses [spoiler] is quite unfair, as tele-fragging is prominent in the fight the lower the boss' hp is, and I wish they would rework Delirium and it's been on the pipeline for a while, the fight is doable with good enough reflexes [/spoiler]

The modding community for the game is wonderful as well. Lots of mods that add a lot thematically, be it items, types of rooms, characters, enemies or specific layouts and floors.

All in all, a decent purchase that will give you a lot to do with the express purpose of getting [spoiler] Dead God [/spoiler], and give you tons of fun in return if you're a fan of roguelites.",1707950528,1707950528,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As my most played game on Steam, it's not hard to see why I'm so hooked. The Binding of Isaac isn't just a game; it's an addictive journey through bizarre and challenging dungeons that captivates with each run. Every session is a unique dive into a weird, darkly humorous world filled with unpredictable power-ups and enemies. The randomness and variety make it an incredible time-sink, but one that's immensely satisfying and constantly rewarding.

The game's ability to keep you on your toes with its ever-changing scenarios and strategies is what makes it so compelling. Whether it's the thrill of defeating a tough boss or the excitement of discovering a powerful item combination, there's always something new and exhilarating around each corner.

In summary, The Binding of Isaac is more than just a game to me – it's a masterpiece of the rogue-like genre and undoubtedly one of my all-time favorites. Its blend of challenging gameplay, replayability, and dark humor earns it a solid 10/10 in my book. A must-play for anyone who enjoys a game that's as rewarding as it is engrossing.",1575058083,1707849339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I first played this game in 2017, around 7 years ago, and this game has gotten better since the day I got it. If you are thinking of buying the game with the dlcs, I would go straight for it, but just like any game, there are downsides people may have when playing the game. For one, the game is rouge-like, so once you die you have to start all over, and for people who haven't played games like this ever before, this may be a really big downside. Another large factor of this game is Gore. Gore is one of the major parts of this game, and if it's not your thing, I don't think you'd like this game that much. Though I came from playing this game disgusted by the gore in 2017, to liking the art style. If you are also a big religious person, there is A LOT of biblical references, I mean its in the name lmfao. Wrapping it all together though, I think everyone should at least try the game out and see how great the game is, and can be. hate it or like it, the game is wonderful.",1675608038,1707762943,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Long Answer:
Pretty repetitive and boring. Imagine beating the game just to unlock an item that you will never find. I used to love this game and bought all its DLCs, Not Worth it. This game has so many unintentional features that absolutely break the game! And you can literally use a cheat menu to get achievements by simply setting a value to 1! Achievements in this game are essentially worthless now! This game requires almost no skill, you just need luck. (no and i don't have a skill issue) I feel the base game is horrible and you need repentance to make it playable. (Don't forget you have to buy every DLC before you can buy repentance!)
Oh yeah the command console? Only in repentance, definition of pay to win. You could argue that repentance is good, i kind of agree, whats the issue? Well repentance is literally just copied anti-birth! Edmund didn't even make the ""game's best DLC"" The community practically built this game for Edmund.
I thought this was a good game and would be cool to get every achievement, but it just made me realize how much i hate this game slowly but surely.
The only reason i have so many hours is due to modding which is actually fun (probably a word foreign to Edmund) but it isn't associated with Edmund (the creator) so i say it doesn't compensate for this horrible game. Dont worry theres even more! Did you know the D infinity in afterbirth would use a random dice effect which could probably mess you the fuck up. BUT if you pay for repentance they fix it and make it good!
How great!
Rating:
Back when i bought it, it was fun and fresh.. but now its repetitive and boring.
4/10 back then.
2/10 now
This base game is not worth the price, ESPECIALLY the DLCs! 50$ for REPENTANCE!? COME ON EDMUND! YOUR CHARGING PEOPLE FOR A MOD! 
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY TO USE COMMUNITY MODS! PUTTING A TAX ON THE FUN WHEN THE TAX ON THE FUN IS SUPPOSED TO BE BUYING THE GAME!
SERIOUSLY EDMUND WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?

Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.

Life was simple, and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac’s mom heard a voice from above.

“Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.”

“I will do my best to save him, my Lord,” Isaac’s mother replied, rushing into Isaac’s room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again the voice called to her, ""Isaac’s soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

“I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,” Isaac’s mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac’s mom heard the voice of God calling to her.

“You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes Lord, anything!” Isaac’s mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else.""

""Yes Lord"", she replied, grabbing a butcher’s knife from the kitchen.

Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.

Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the basement hidden under his rug.

Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.",1707545380,1707545380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

250900,157706085,76561199121442614,0,2,1090,0,1001,1707495809,"Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is not just a game; it's a journey into the depths of the human psyche, wrapped in a hauntingly beautiful and grotesque package. From the moment you dive into its macabre world, you're ensnared by its twisted narrative, addictive gameplay, and captivating art style.

At its core, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a roguelike dungeon crawler, but it's so much more than that. You play as Isaac, a young boy who must navigate through procedurally generated dungeons filled with grotesque monsters and nightmarish bosses, all while contending with his own inner demons. The game's narrative is as compelling as it is disturbing, exploring themes of religion, abuse, and existential dread.

What truly sets Binding of Isaac: Rebirth apart is its gameplay. Every run feels fresh and unpredictable, thanks to the game's procedurally generated levels and vast array of items and power-ups. Each playthrough presents new challenges and opportunities, encouraging experimentation and strategic thinking. Whether you're blasting enemies with tears of blood or summoning demonic familiars to aid you in battle, the game's combat mechanics are satisfyingly visceral and endlessly entertaining.

Visually, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a work of art. The game's hand-drawn graphics are both charming and grotesque, with every character and enemy oozing personality and detail. From the grotesque monstrosities lurking in the shadows to the hauntingly beautiful environments, every inch of the game is dripping with atmosphere.

Accompanying the stunning visuals is a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's dark tone. Each track sets the mood brilliantly, whether you're exploring dank caves or facing off against hulking bosses. The sound design as a whole is impeccable, with every squelch, shriek, and sinister whisper adding to the game's immersive atmosphere.

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is not a game for the faint of heart. It's dark, it's challenging, and it's unapologetically bizarre. But for those willing to embrace its twisted charms, it's a masterpiece of game design and storytelling. With its endless replay value, captivating narrative, and addictive gameplay, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an experience that will stay with you long after you've put down the controller.",1707216275,1707216275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I first got contact with it through a Youtuber I liked that mainly focused on Tekkit Minecraft videos, he played Isaac probably three times and I remember rewatching the same videos over and over because I was so obsessed with the game. 

Years passed, and I found out they made a sequel, the Binding of Isaac Rebirth, that basically remastered the whole game, added new features and changed the artstyle to a more retro feel, which made it very attractive for 15 year old me.

I first played it through a ""borrowed"" version I got on some sketchy sites, I also got the Afterbirth expansion to got with it, and I remember playing it viciously on my old laptop from 2016. I grinded the game for hours, unlocking every character, getting all of the items, getting the hard completion marks and overall having a great time. I remember being invested in the story of the game and its religious themes, writing theories about it at school just to play the game for hours when I eventually got home, it was a great time.

Then in 2019 I got the game, for real this time, and again, I grinded the shit out of it. Afterbirth + had already released and there was a lot of content to enjoy. 

The game is simply amazing. There is a LOT of content to unlock, many different ways to play the game and an absolute shitload of characters to play as, each with a different focus and playstyle. The change from Flash to Rebirth was a very good one. 

But the real deal comes from the game's final update. Repentance. 

So, Afterbirth and its successor, Afterbirth+ were a flop. There was very little content added that was actually good, only half of the characters added were actually interesting, with one of the bad ones barely being playable, so yeah, the community didn't like it. But a big reason to why they didn't like it was because at the same time, there as a fan-made mod that was being given out for FREE that added a lot more interesting content, which gathered the attention of basically the whole community. That mod was Antibirth. 
Antibirth did what Afterbirth failed to. Not only were the new items actually interesting, but the mod added a whole new path to which you could play from, adding a new final boss with a quest that took 3 whole chapters to get to. You also had a brand new OST made by Mudeth which breathed new life into the game and very much complimented the already amazing content that the mod added.

People loved that mod, so when they compared it to the actual official expansion, everyone was pretty underwhelmed.

And then Repentance was announced.

A new, final expansion, which would take content directly from the Antibirth mod and make it official. Working with the team that made the original mod, the devs began to work on a new expansion that would allow Binding of Isaac to close itself on a great note, both with content players already knew and new stuff that we were promised would change the game forever. Edmund, the creator of the original game, went so far as to say that Repentance was getting so big it could literally be called a sequel to Rebirth.

And boy did they deliver on that.

Not only was the content from Antibirth ported with EXTREME faith to the original, but the new content blew everyone out of the water, with not just two, but NINETEEN NEW CHARACTERS, each with unique and fun mechanics for us to enjoy. Not one, but TWO alternate paths we could take for different final bosses, each with its own quirks and missions.
Not just that, but they balanced a lot of bad things about already exisiting characters, like The Keeper, Blue Baby and The Lost. They also buffed some already great characters, giving them new things to do and options to play with.

Repentance rekindled my love for Isaac and made me remember what was like watching old YT videos of Flash Isaac, discovering things for the first time and loving it every single step of the way. This game is by far one of the best Roguelikes ever created and I am very thankful for the work the devs put into this one final update, an update that not only made the game we already had even better, but gave us new things to love and unlock, in true Isaac fashion.

Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.

The Binding of Isaac and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth are great classic Edmund McMillen games, but for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance, the game designers obviously were not thinking straight. At first, it seems like a pretty decent game. A little different from the first in the series but, that's okay. Zelda II was different from the first, Mario 2 was different, but they were all good. 

The first thing that's strikingly different is the fact that ya have to go through alt paths, get your shit rocked, and cry. I never really minded that, it makes it a little more like character development, and it's kinda like The Binding of Isaac, so that's okay. But the first problem comes in when you unlock Tainted Characters.

Why do these creatures need to exist? Like what the fuck? Why are their unlocks garbage? Nobody feels like sitting through this every time. How would you like it if you were hours into a run where shit stats Mcgee dies in one hit, and I came over and punched you in the balls repeatedly till you won your run, and you unlocked a shitty trinket you're never going to use. Now, I mean, why did they think that would be a good idea and ruin the flow of the game like that? Did they think it would make the game harder for the sake of being hard? I mean, this is one of the most annoying features in any game ever. What's the point? Yeah, the, I mean, the monsters are stronger in the alt path and the ascent, but why is it necessary to have shitty annoying gimmicks and terrible stats and why does it apply to every tainted character? It's fucking stupid.

Another thing that's really annoying about this game is the fact that the item pool is so bloated with shit that could only have been conceived from the sick, twisted mind of whoever designed this shit load of fuck. I mean, still, that's not uncommon, you know this is a quirk in most rouge-likes: it's the same in many great games like Risk of Rain 2, but, lemme explain. 

One of the common themes that one may seem to plague this game is how often you take unavoidable damage cause you didn't get lucky enough to get a single item. The amount of times my fat ass gets dicked down by blue spiked rocks just cause I wasn't moving faster than 0.8 speed makes me wanna drink and cry like Isaac. This wouldn't be such an issue if the item pool wasn't infested with useless garbage like Plan C, The Poop, Infestation, Pageant Boy, etc. Like is it too much to ask for a fucking stat upgrade? Give me a fucking Belt, a Wooden Spoon for God's sake. 

It doesn't help that the game shoves shit pills up your ass like a fucking suppository. I swear if I had to hear that absent motherfucker scream TEARS DOWN one more time I was going to wring out Isaac like a moist towel. Like gee, thank you SO much for giving me that Tears Down pill Ed, me and my 1.20 tear rate really fuckin' appreciate it. Again, it doesn't add up to any of the fun in the game. It's just unfair and it's annoying.

What a piece of shit. I mean, I feel horrible that I had to play this game in order to make this review, but I did it to demonstrate its dreadfulness and I forced myself to play it to completion just so that ya don't have to. So you should thank me for telling ya to stay away from this horrible steaming pile of goat shit. I mean.... I know it's useless complaining about a game that was made to give completionists a great time sink or whatever, but it just blows my mind on how fuckin' horrible it is. I mean, it's consistently annoying.

Why? Why is it so bad? If all these problems were changed then we'd have a great lineage of classic The Binding of Isaac games, but.... history is history, and we might as well try to count Afterbirth+ as... y'know the definitive Isaac experience, and leave this awful piece of horse shit alone, as it stands today as one of the biggest fuck-ups of all time.

Thank you for listening, good night.

Do yourselves a favor and get hooked on this game- by yourself, with friends, with mods, without mods, and try checking out wonderful Isaac content creators like Grayfruit, Albino, Magicaleye, LazyMattman, and Lonslo.",1706226478,1706226478,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.

""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""

""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.

Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac.

Oh, you didn't get a good tier 3 or higher? Reset and when you just start with a tier 3 or higher there's no way to fail runs on any normal character. The only time you won't complete a run is when you are playing a tainted version of a hard character and make dumb mistakes or if it is tainted Lost. Even the challenges aren't hard and they are supposed to be challenges. I get it's player-friendly but when all of my runs are broken with no ascension system like in other Rogue-likes where they keep your broken runs in check it kinda blows. I literally dont remember getting a god run in A20 StS without at least 50+ runs in-between my 2 god runs but in Isaac just today I got 2 god runs in 4...

Also, the way coins and greed and shop systems are made pisses me off and If I get too many coins without being able to spend my autism kicks in and I get so mad I restart the run and have to take a break because I get like genuinely mad but that's just me issue, the game still has a solid shop system.

-So many items like woah mama 
-So many characters like moah wama 
-Pretty much infinite replay-ability with a satisfying core game-play loop of unlocking new items/characters to make future runs potentially more interesting 
-Subtle storytelling with what little bits of voice acting there are being executed brilliantly (Isaac's voice makes me cry every time i hear it)
-Endless stream of quality mods made by one of the best modding communities I've ever seem, some of which being complete overhauls of the games mechanics such as Fiend Folio or Epiphany  
-Soundtrack (""innocence glitched"" is a banger) 

Things that i don't really like about The binding of Isaac (Mostly just minor things you can fix with mods):
-No item descriptions, memorising the effects of like 400 items is pretty hard
-Some items break synergies such as Moms Knife, but this is pretty rare
-Isaac does not do a little dance (this is where the mods come in)

His dear mom gets some wild instructions from above to sacrifice Isaac. As any sane kid would do, Isaac bolts into the basement, only to find a heap of challenges and enemies waiting for him.

It's like the best of the old-school Zelda games, but with a twist. Procedurally generated levels, a boatload of items and power-ups, and different characters each with their own bag of tricks make for a gaming experience like no other.

The game hooks you in with its high replay value. You'll keep coming back for more as you unlock new items, characters, and endings. And get this – every playthrough is a whole new ball game thanks to the randomly generated levels.

I can't stress this enough – The Binding of Isaac is seriously addictive. The tough gameplay, the need for strategic decision-making, and the thrill of discovering new items and synergies will keep you glued to your screen for hours on end.

This game's a true legend. It's simple yet hits the mark, and the gameplay just keeps on delivering. No wonder it's got a hardcore fan base and a truckload of critical acclaim.

In a nutshell, The Binding of Isaac is a captivating, challenging game that's got it all – unique mechanics, a deep storyline, and a whole lot of replay value. It's no wonder it's become a hit among fans of dungeon crawlers and roguelike games.

Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.",1705458780,1705458780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

These sound like complaints, of course, something you would never want in a gaming experience, much less something with such replayability as a rogue-like. However; these complaints are not permanent. When you make a fatal mistake in a run, you learn. When you take an item that costs you a god run, you learn. When your luck abandons you and you die to your own bomb, you learn. That is the fun of The Binding of Isaac, because every stupid thing you do is another lesson
The complaints? Game balancing, enemy and item design, luck? These things will vanish during your experience, not because they stop being a problem, but because you learned to surpass them. It's not about ""enduring the bad parts"", its about teaching yourself to simply be better than them. It's damn difficult, so painfully hard, but it is completely worth it.
It's not for everyone, to be sure, the challenge the game presents is a selective experience, but if you are willing to be challenged, The Binding of Isaac is a must-play experience",1705018027,1705018027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is really good and a staple of the genre. Synergies are fun and the gameplay loop is extremely addicting, Repentance provides a significant boost in content that is well appreciated. Only real issues I have with this game is some runs can feel a little too unfair and most runs drag on for a very long amount of time for a roguelike.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else!""

Brace yourselves, pilgrims, for we're delving deep into the labyrinthine world of ""The Binding of Isaac,"" a title once known as the chaotic firestorm of ""Battlefield 4."" We've swapped dog tags for tears, M16s for Mom's Knife, and squad leaders for Guppy (bless his watery soul). So buckle up, grab your trinkets, and prepare to descend into the basement – it's gonna be a wild ride.

Campaign: Repentant Runs and Boss Baby Belial

The Isaac-sanguine campaign boasts a roguelike structure, each ""run"" a chance to tear through Isaac's tear-stained subconscious, battling mutated versions of his own sins and insecurities. We're talking Mom's Heart, a pulsating embodiment of parental pressure, or Super Lust, a hypersexual monstrosity born from Isaac's forbidden desires. It's a darkly comedic romp through Isaac's psyche, each death a reset, a chance to learn, adapt, and maybe, just maybe, escape the eternal loop.

Sure, the story lacks the geopolitical intrigue of China versus America, but Isaac's internal struggle is far more relatable. Who hasn't battled their own inner demons? Who hasn't wanted to crawl out of their fleshy meat-prison and into the sweet embrace of oblivion? Isaac captures that existential dread with shocking sincerity, even if it involves chasing headless horsemen with poop bombs.

Multiplayer Mayhem: Basement Brawls and Item Hoarders

But where ""The Binding of Isaac"" truly shines is in its chaotic multiplayer. Imagine 8 Isaacs, armed with whatever unholy concoction of pills and trinkets they could find, duking it out in a procedurally generated basement. It's a glorious mess of tears, bombs, and passive-aggressive item sniping. You'll forge fleeting alliances with fellow scapular-clad brethren, only to betray them for a juicy Sacred Heart drop. The backstabbing is real, the salt flows freely, and every run is a unique, demented masterpiece.

While ""Battlefield 4"" offered large-scale, objective-based warfare, Isaac's multiplayer thrives on its small-scale, anything-goes mayhem. It's like a twisted sibling rivalry, a test of who can exploit the system and the other Isaacs the fastest. Yes, the learning curve is brutal, and rage quits are inevitable. But there's an undeniable thrill in outsmarting your opponents, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat with a perfectly timed Brimstone laser.

Weapons and Tech: From Pea Shooters to Godhead

And then there's the arsenal. Forget your Battlefield loadouts of fancy gadgets and laser-guided rockets. Isaac's arsenal is a bricolage of the bizarre, a hodgepodge of tear-shaped projectiles that defy logic and common decency. We're talking homing snot rockets, razor-sharp tears fueled by rage, and even lasers fired from Isaac's own eyes (thanks, Dr. Fetus!). Each run offers a new combination, a chance to discover synergies and combos that turn Isaac into a tear-spewing god of destruction.

Sure, ""Battlefield 4"" boasted cutting-edge tech and next-gen destruction, but the sheer variety and unpredictability of Isaac's tear arsenal is unmatched. One run, you're a humble guppy shooting fishy tears of fury, the next, you're a monstrosity wielding the power of Godhead, warping reality with every shot. It's a constant discovery, a never-ending power trip fueled by pixelated tears and questionable life choices.

Verdict: A Basement Odyssey Worth Every Penny

So, is ""The Binding of Isaac"" (formerly known as ""Battlefield 4"") worth your hard-earned Isaac-dollars? Absolutely. It's a darkly comedic descent into the depths of one little boy's psyche, a roguelike masterpiece that's equal parts challenging and rewarding. While it may lack the large-scale battles and military thrills of its former self, it offers a more personal, introspective experience, a chance to confront your own inner demons while dodging explosive poop bombs. Just remember, as you descend into the basement, to embrace the chaos, hoard the items, and never trust another Isaac (especially if they're holding Sacred Heart).

Final Score: 9.5 Isaac tears out of 10 (but deduct half a tear for Mom's Foot, because frankly, who needs that?)

Getting all the DLCs is highly recommended for full enjoyment of the game, as they add more items and characters into the already impressive repertoire, with the final DLC, Repentance, giving the game a very satisfying conclusion. 

In TBOI, you'll need to play through all the characters multiple times to unlock different items and endings, which may sound like a chore, but the fact that the map is procedurally generated every time you start a new run means you're never going to get the same map and items twice, which helps keep things fresh and exciting.

There are a lot of different synergies between the literal hundreds of items that could be found in your journey, with some being goofy and silly, while some could make you feel like a god blasting down enemies from the opposite end of the room before you even see them. It is a lot of fun trying out different items and finding out new synergies between them. Challenges also allow you to experience the game in unique and different ways.

Personally, I play TBOI when I have only a little time before bed, or when I just wanna chill and play a game while relaxing to some music. TBOI hits that sweet spot of being simple enough to play with half a brain (kinda), yet complex enough to scratch that gamer itch.

You can do some pretty bonkers things in this game with the right combination of items. There are tons of possibilities and interactions where you might wonder ""how does this item work with this one I already have?"" and then end up with a bombastic result.

However, because of the rng-centric nature of the game and genre, some run goals are simply not doable because of item drops. Expect a lot of resetting, mostly early. Earlygame is pretty bad (and can be straight up unfair) as a lot of characters start off pitifully weak (for generic unlocks this can alleviated by playing someone like Azazel). But, once you get the ball rolling, you can delete bosses and clear rooms in less than a few seconds.

Lastly, for the sake of your own sanity, get some mods from the workshop that make the game more clear to play, as the base game lacks item descriptions! Also consider looking up some guides for how to unlock new areas, endings, and items.",1704785562,1704785647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my first time playing this game (have not watched gameplay or read anything about it) and I must say that it was a rough start.
There's no tutorial, no explanation of what the different things are or how stuff works. It was rather frustrating!
When picking up new items the name and a general description flashes on your screen for only 1sec, and are nowhere to be seen in your stats other than an icon. The lack of any detailed description, makes it a guessing game. Sometimes it's effects are obvious, but many times they are not. When you don't know exactly what each items does, you can't really do a strategic build.

Base game is OK. Gameplay feels a bit shallow, even with all the different items. Needs QOL improvements and mods can deliver this, but mods are not supported for the base game.


[b]GOOD[/b]
- Interesting and relatively fun, for a while.
- Can exit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off.

[b]BAD[/b]
- No items description! It doesn't even show the name of the discovered items in the menu, only an icon.
- No detailed description of items effects.
- No explanation of the core gameplay to new players, like: What are these icons in the stats? What are items, trinkets, pills, cards? What's the difference between them?
- Can only shoot straight up/down/left/right. If you move while shooting, you can somewhat shoot in an angle, but not by very much.
- No perma upgrades! You don't gain any direct advantages for your next run. There are some unlockables, like characters, but it's very limited.
- No mouse support, it's keyboard only. It does however support controllers, which I think is the better option.
- Random stuttering. Game freezes for a split sec every now and then. Most of which I fixed by disabling ControllerHotPlug in it's options.ini file (search the forum for more details). Which have been a common problem since 2014.
- Gameplay/levels feels very same-ish and it does get a bit boring after a while.
- Mods/Workshop requires the DLCs.

Today ""The Binding of Issac"" stands in my opinion a video game powerhouse that is not stifled by censorship or cheesy gimiks. If triple A developers wanted to know how to make a great game; they should look no further than ""The Binding of Issac"" because it truly is a gem. At the current time they are releasing a full modding suite that will allow the user to enjoy their game to their hearts content and in their own way. ""Take notes Minecraft, Terraria, Dynatsy Warriors, KOEI entertainment and EA"" this is what users want a game that has a specific mechanic that works with the ability to customize it.

All bashing aside; I recommend this game to everyone. Its dark tones are kind of intense so parental guidance is advised but do not think for second that takes away from the games charm, re-play-ability or its delightful gameplay mechanics.

Updated

Ed Mcmillans team has blantely decided to ignore the games short comings and are still using code dated back to 2012 ... I have stated that this is poorly optimized then without warning they wanted to ad online to the already creaking bones of this game.

Just like blue baby this is a loss. Success seems to have gotten to them. They use LUA 32 bit despite the very clear CLEAR issue with modern machines. Go play something else.

Developed by Edmund McMillen and Nicalis, this indie gem is a testament to the power of procedural generation and the thrill of discovery, making it an engaging experience that kept me coming back for more.

From the outset, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth captivated me with its unique art style. The hand-drawn, grotesque characters and environments painted a disturbing yet oddly captivating picture. The game's visual style perfectly matched its dark and twisted narrative, creating an atmosphere that was both unsettling and fascinating. Each floor of the dungeon felt like a descent into madness, with every enemy encounter and power-up adding to the overall sense of chaotic beauty.

The narrative, though minimalistic, provided a dark backdrop to the gameplay. Playing as Isaac, a young boy escaping from his deeply troubled and religiously fanatical mother, I descended through the basement depths filled with grotesque monsters and nightmarish bosses. The narrative served as an unsettling motivator, urging me to explore the depths of the dungeon and face the horrors that awaited.

What truly sets The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth apart is its roguelike structure. Each run through the randomly generated dungeons offered a unique experience, with different room layouts, enemy placements, and item drops. The thrill of not knowing what awaits around the next corner kept me on the edge of my seat, making every playthrough a fresh and unpredictable journey.

The variety of power-ups and items in the game added a layer of strategy to the experience. Experimenting with different combinations of items led to unexpected synergies, transforming Isaac into a powerhouse or a bizarre hybrid of abilities. The constant sense of progression, despite frequent deaths, fueled my determination to delve deeper into the dungeon and uncover its secrets.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's gameplay loop is addictively satisfying. The tight controls and responsive combat made each encounter a skillful dance, where dodging enemy attacks and strategically using items became second nature. The game's difficulty was challenging but fair, rewarding skillful play and encouraging continuous improvement.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Ridiculon, deserves special mention. The haunting melodies and atmospheric tunes perfectly complemented the dark and surreal visuals, enhancing the overall experience. The music became a crucial part of the game's identity, immersing me further into its unsettling world.

While The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth may not be everyone's cup of tea due to its dark themes and challenging gameplay, for those who appreciate roguelikes and enjoy a touch of the macabre, it's a masterpiece. Its addictive nature, procedural generation, and the sheer variety of content make it a game that I found myself returning to again and again. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is not just a game; it's a dark and captivating journey into the unknown, where every run feels like a descent into madness and discovery.",1704425742,1704425742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who had (back then) only occasionally played video games, I had some difficulties in the beginning and it was quite frustrating to always die within the first five minutes of the game. I still think that it isn't the best game to start with (at least if you are a beginner like I am), but I also noticed that if you really stick to it and accept the fact that you will probably die a hundred times before making any significant process, the game can really get super entertaining and fascinating at a certain point. I personally love the mix of coordination and reactivity it requires. Sometimes, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to ""solve"" a certain room and I often need to try out many different strategies before finding the one that works but to me, this trial and error method is also part of the reasons why I have started to like it so much. There is a certain level of luck / chance involved which makes the game a little unpredictable but at the same time that is also exactly what makes it so much more interesting and distinguishes it from other games. I would definitely recommend it as I had (and still have) so much fun exploring it. Every day, I am discovering new things and it's so satisfying to make progress, even if it's only small one :)",1704291604,1704291604,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,1,True,False,False

Let's clear the story. The Binding of Isaac  first release was an incredible top-down shooter with a very sick story and very hard difficulty system which is the ""must have"" recipe for a boomer old gamer like me.
How difficult it is? For Me very! Very very very hard... I'm the lame I know but the third element of this game what is stick to my chair for hours is the highly addiction level because of the roughlike elements.
If died you will promise for your self just one more round and the next what you notice is that just somehow vanished 4 hours and still no process in the game... :D Love It

So this is second part of Isaac's story the ""Rebirth"". I just bought every dlc for it because it has a huge support by the developers and the community as well.
I spent 120 hours for it and I'm nowhere but I can't stop the playing always new secret new character new feature new challenge etc..... After 120 hours I've got still 660 locked achievements.. :D It's huge 

Worth every penny for me i can only just recommend it if you like old skool shooter games. 5/5 as I said must have!",1704128219,1704128219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is what endless replayability looks like.
Hundreds mechanics, none of whom are gimmicks.
Thousands secrets that really expand the game.
A non-repeatable challenge.
Every run can be won with the worst RNG.
A mix of religion, pixel feces, and body horror would have been a flaw in other circumstances, but half of the crazy stuff of the game could only come from this way.

地は無形の空虚であり、暗闇が深層の顔を覆っていたのに対し、神からの風が水面に吹き荒れた。
それから神は「光あれ」と言われました。そして光がありました。
そして神は光が良かったのを見ました。そして神は光と闇を分けました。
神は光の日と呼ばれ、闇は夜と呼ばれました。そして、夕方があり、朝、最初の日がありました。
そして神は言われた、「水の中にドームを作り、水と水を分けさせなさい」。
それで神はドームを作り、ドームの下にある水とドームの上にある水を分けました。そして、そうでした。
神はドームスカイと呼ばれました。そして夕方があり、二日目は朝でした。
そして神は言われた、「空の下の水が一つの場所に集められ、乾いた地が現われるように」。そして、そうでした。
神は乾燥した土地を地球と呼び、集められた水を海と呼びました。そして、神はそれが良いことを見ました。
神は言われた、「地は草を生みなさい。種を産む植物、種を含む実を結ぶ地上のあらゆる種類の果樹」。そして、そうでした。
地球は植物を生み出しました。植物はあらゆる種類の種を生み出し、あらゆる種類の木は種を含む実を結んでいます。そして、神はそれが良いことを見ました。
そして夕方があり、三日目は朝でした。
そして神は言った、「空のドームに昼と夜を分ける明かりを置いて、しるしと季節と日と年とにさせなさい。
そして、それらを空のドームの光にして、地球に光を放ちましょう。」
神は二つの大きな光を造りました。昼を支配する大きな光と夜を支配する小さな光、そして星です。
神は彼らを空のドームに置き、地球に光を与えた。
昼と夜を支配し、暗闇から光を分離します。そして、神はそれが良いことを見ました。
そして夕方があり、四日目の朝があった。
そして神は言った、「水が生き物の群れを生みだし、鳥が空のドームを越えて地球上を飛ぶようにしましょう」。
それで神は偉大な海の怪物と、水が群がるあらゆる種類のあらゆる生き物、そしてあらゆる種類の翼のある鳥を創造されました。そして、神はそれが良いことを見ました。
神は彼らに祝福を与えて、「実り豊かになり、海の水を増やし、水を満たし、鳥を地上で育てなさい」と言われた。
そして夕方があり、五日目に朝があった。
そして神は言った、「地はあらゆる種類の生き物を生むようにしよう。牛と忍び寄る物、あらゆる種類の地の野生動物。」そして、そうでした。
神はあらゆる種類の地球の野生動物、あらゆる種類の牛、あらゆる種類の地面に忍び寄るすべてのものを造られました。そして、神はそれが良いことを見ました。
それから神は言った、「私たちの似姿に従って、私たちの姿に人類を作りましょう。海の魚、空の鳥、牛、そしてその上に彼らを支配させましょう。地球のすべての野生動物、そして地球に忍び寄るあらゆる忍び寄るものの上に。」
それで神は人類を彼のイメージで、神のイメージで創造した。男性と女性が作成しました。
神は彼らを祝福され、神は彼らに言われた、「実り豊かになり、地を満たし、地を征服し、海の魚と、空の鳥と、すべての生き物とを支配する。地球上を移動します。」
神は言われた、「見よ、わたしはあなたに、すべての地の表面にある種を産むすべての植物、およびその実に種を含むすべての木をあなたに与えた。
そして、地球のすべての獣、空のすべての鳥、そして地球上にcreepうすべてのもの、生命の息吹を持つすべてのものに、私はすべての緑の植物を食物に与えました。」そうだった。

While yes, the game is hard as nails, it's also pretty fun. Everything is randomized, monsters and areas have so much personality, and for those people with immature humor, there is an absurd amount of poop. Items you can collect can change your fire rate, give you a bomb that releases poison toxin when thrown, or even just give you pubes on your head.

The story is also pretty simple too, compared to other games and movies at the time. A mom hears a voice from above thinking that its God. The voice tells her to kill her son, Isaac. Isaac, out of fear, vaults himself through a trapdoor under his rug, in order to escape from her. (And yes, I know there's more to the story, but this review is spoiler free, mkay?)

All and all, Isaac is a great game. It's funny, challenging, disgusting, and much more. Although if you want to pick it up, wait for the summer sale or something. $50 for the definitive experience (which tweaks gameplay and adds like, 500 more items) is a bit overpriced. 8/10",1703882874,1703882874,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Isaac was simple, and they were both Isaac.
That was, until the day Isaac's Isaac heard a Isaac from above: ""Your Isaac has become corrupted by Isaac! He needs to be Isaac!""

""I will do my best Isaac to save Isaac, my Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again, the Isaac called to her:
""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac! He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac.""

""I will follow your Isaac, Isaac. I have Isaac in thee,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac away in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of you.""

""Yes, Isaac. Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac begged.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I require a Isaac. Your Isaac Isaac will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to me, to Isaac that you Isaac me above all Isaac!""

""Yes, Isaac,"" she replied, grabbing a Isaac from the Isaac.
Isaac, watching through a Isaac in the Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find a Isaac, he noticed a Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac.

It can come off as mildly anti-christian, and makes a lot of jokes about people who are religious as well as referencing things that some less than christly people have done.

And in the latest DLC, it does put forth a more positive message, and there is a very satisfying and clear conclusion to the story.

Playing the 1hit character pre dlc was enjoyable.  Post dlc, it's unfun unfair tedium.  

That's to say nothing of the 7 bullshit annoying characters (mostly tainted characters) that people playing to progress the game will spend their time playing most, not because they're fun, but because they'll take the longest to unlock the achievements for.  

It adds multiple BS changes that effectively worsen the overall experience.  For instance, post dlc, multiple vanilla enemies shoot ""tears"" at that travel in such a fast speed, it would be considered excessive in enter the gungeon.  Do you know why that's a problem?  Enter the gungeon has a dodge roll, this game doesn't.

I'm not even saying I can't complete the final set of achievements, I know I can, it's not a skill issue, I just also know from past experience that it's going to be just as unfun and tedious as the last hundred or so achievements, especially since almost all of them are related to unfun characters I don't want to play.

You know, I'd like to claim going to college is a waste of time, but it really depends.  if you're going to get a job in feminist dance theory, maybe study that on your own time and don't waste the money.  if you're going to design video games, at least then the college might teach you two things.

1) ""why do people consider my game fun, and keep wanting to play it""

I'd love to know more details on what things do on how to use them but other than that, it provides a lot of variety of content thanks to the variety of power ups and everything you discover as you explore different things. 

Probably that's a interesting way to develop a game; something relatively simple to how it's played but not much explained to give the player chance to discover everything by himself.

With three DLC’s released during its 10 years of living, the game has gained a massive fan base. I am sure that almost everybody on steam has heard the name “The Binding of Isaac”. Why is this game so popular? If you are a person scrolling through the reviews looking to see if you should get the game or not, then look no further.

The Binding of Isaac is a game that takes inspirations from the Bible and goes “hey, what if we twisted it??????” Essentially, the entire story is Abraham sacrificing his son but the difference here is that it’s Isaac’s mom that wants to sacrifice Isaac, and there is no “Jesus stopping him at the very end” thing like in the Bible. (I am not Christian so please tell me in the comments if I said anything wrong.) Isaac’s dad has left the house in a messy divorce attempt. So how exactly does Isaac live after having no father and a crazy mother?

…Well, he jumps down the basement.
The goal of the game is simple; you are moving through different floors to progress. There are a bunch of randomly generated rooms that you need to get through to get to the boss. Kill the boss, and you get an item and you get to go to the next floor.
Additionally, there are treasure rooms (these give you an item). There are also shops that give you stuff in exchange for coins. You get coins either from room clear rewards, items, or room layouts (sometimes they have coins scattered around). Keep in mind that after the first floor, these two things require keys to open.
And lastly (assuming you are in a fresh save file), sacrifice rooms. It’s simple; step on spike, get hurt, and gamble for rewards. 
In addition, after you beat a boss, if you didn’t get hurt much, you can get a Devil Deal where you can get items in exchange for health. It is worth noting that all of this is randomly generated.
The gameplay loop is simple, right? Well, it was specifically designed for the loop to get larger and longer as you unlock things. This game has a SHIT TON of achievement unlocking. Some of them are crazy hard, but fair. Simple. Beat a certain endgame boss as a certain character and you get a specific unlock that makes the game feel more fleshed out. There is a post-it on top of the character selection screen for each character that keeps track of what bosses you beat with that character. I will not spoil anything else about the game. 10/10
You thought this long review was over? naw fam
There are also an INCREDIBLE amount of workshop mods that make the game better. Just don’t… enable the r34 one…. yeah stay away from that one. Other mods are just complete overhauls, skins, and even more totally fleshed-out characters for you to play as, with their own unlocks sometimes too! There are also quality of life changes.

Here we are 2 Dead Gods in. I lost my sanity. My parents won't stop fighting over money. I learned from my 1k hours that tears can be used as a mass murder weapon and may summon light beams from the sky. I could have become a famous engineer, but I preferred to play as an abused kid (which is kinda relatable). This game taught me that having a brother is a pain in the ass (s/o to Jacob and Essau). The first hundred hours were a dive into depression trying to understand how the game works. Thankfully, I'm now a full fledged depressed guy, but I also have a new way to go through it. This game was a good journey that is not yet finished, I still have to complete my last Dead God. Should I recommend this game ? Absolutely, but, be prepared to lose yourself in the process. This game will throw you from insufferable games that will make you want to rip your hair from your head into games that are instantly won from the first item to games unfinishable because the only thought about pressing the fire button will crash your game. Play it, it really is worth the experience. That said. See you in the next update when I finish my third Dead God and I wish you for the best when playing this sanity challenging game.

This one encourages you to grab the inch and take it a mile- punishing you harshly for not doing so.

And instead of using this ultimate power to exploit you for microtransactions or ad time, it just uses it to keep you having fun. I can't believe that's a positive of modern games.

[b]Random mechanics[/b] and a strong grind are some of my most despised things, but through over 10 years of love, this game has never disrespected me in a way that's commonplace for most releases nowadays.

Games that I see as easy are frustrating and hard, and games with easy controls to me are very difficult to someone who has never used a keyboard/controller for a character before. I used to tell people NOT to play the binding of isaac as one of their first games because it IS A HARD GAME, however despite my warnings I have seen many friends try this game for one reason or another and then get unexpectedly into it. Playing for many days/weeks/months, learning how to control a character well, and getting far into it. I was initially pretty confused as to why a game like this was so consistently popular among my friends who weren't very experienced with games, but I think a big reason for it is because the pushback from the game, the difficulty, the progression, and the general gameplay loop is so naturally integrated and adapts to YOU so extremely well that it becomes enjoyable for mostly everyone. The progression is wonderful, even after playing the game on-and-off for years. Incredible game in base and the DLC (particularly repentance) has made this one of my favorite and most played games.

But seriously, this game saved my life. I was very very depressed a few years ago and played this game pretty much 10 hours a day and slept the rest. I was struggling to eat and I lost 30 pounds within the month which was a good percentage of my body weight. I probably would've made much worse decisions if I didn't have this game to consume my time and my heart while I was struggling to get better.

The early game is a lot of fun. The RNG can be awesome or brutal, and that's part of the fun. The items can have some cool synergies, or even game breaking combos (which is also part of the fun). Those aspects are very addictive and more importantly, enjoyable. However, the later levels (Womb, Cathedral, Chest) are really boring, both visually and game-play-wise. They are poorly thought out padding, and inexcusably lazy design. The choices the designers made for those levels are baffling. Also, avoid the Repentance DLC. This sounds like I'm not recommending the game, but it really is worthwhile, just be prepared to be underwhelmed when you unlock later levels.

Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.",1703139443,1703139443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

extremely difficult, having to avoid damage for entire floors to get a chance at powerful items, and balance resources to get normal ones and make your way through the rooms

17 ([spoiler]x2[/spoiler]) characters with gimmicks ranging from the mundane (more starting health but less damage) to the busted (short range high damage laser beam and flight) to the absurd ([spoiler]moving with a spirit, and attacking with a stationary pile of bones, which the spirit can pick up and chuck across the room[/spoiler]) to the asinine ([spoiler]no strictly defensive items or extra lives can spawn and any damage will instantly kill you.[/spoiler])

absolutely ludicrous amount of unlocks and attention to detail, coupled with wonderful pixelart and music

unless you head empty your way through without getting any of the story or the allusions from certain items, the game needs a content warning for just about everything

Also Isaac is so relatable and literally just like me frfr!! :steamhappy:",1703031858,1703031858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You know, when I started playing this game for the first time, I thought it was going to be what so many of the nay-saying reviews claimed that it would be. I expected some wannabe-edgy ""Reddit Atheist"" style bashing of the Christian faith. I expected no nuance, no emotion other than anger from this game.

I came out with tears in my eyes.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

[spoiler]
This game explores the effect of religious zealotry on children. I would compare it to Stephen King's ""Carrie"" in a way, with Isaac having a wildly religious and abusive mother and an absent father. His mother is obsessed with an idea of spiritual redemption, presumably as a means to compensate for the father's abandonment and theft from the family. Isaac is deeply affected by this, and he comes to the conclusion that his parents' separation is his fault, believing himself to be sinful because of his mother's harsh words. He then (presumably) ends his life by suffocating in a chest, leaving his mother to grieve over his dead body.

What this game does brilliantly is making you question if anything in the story is real. You gain bits of information about the game through the endings- the final of which implies that either Isaac is coping with his demise as he ascends to heaven, or that it was all merely a story told to Isaac's father by Isaac, with his parents still in a happy relationship. There are references to Isaac's journey into Purgatory, but you still can't tell how much of it is real. You can't even tell if Isaac's mother even tried to kill him in the first place, potentially suggesting that he's using that to justify his suicide. Everything is simultaneously murky and clear. This game is a genius example of how to use an unreliable narrator while still providing a functional, dark narrative.  [/spoiler]

Why I praise this game so much is that it made me reflect on myself and my religion. This game takes many cues from Catholicism, my personal faith. It made me look at the dogmatism in my own life, in my church, and in the greater institution as a whole. I wept at the final ending, especially given how I lost my father at a fairly young age. All of this pain and despair I felt led me to think of this as one of my favorite games of all time.

Everything down to the last finite detail is absolutely amazing (Except the void floor). I'm very sad that the game won't be updated pretty much anymore, but the expected update (Online multiplayer, if you didn't know) would be amazing. I've only been watching people play the game until I decided to go and buy it when it was on sale, and the game is as good as advertised! Not only is the game amazing, but the modding community ups that by five hundred percent!

The way you can rig the game in your favor can be very fun (Or insanely boring, no in-between). Items like Red Key or Rock Bottom that have so much potential to be great if you use them correctly are some of my favorite items in the game, rather than just walking into the angel room and finding Sacred Heart, which may be cool and epic, but it isn't fun, and it's just plain boring.

IGN describes the game as having ""creepy-cute dungeons"" that are different and challenging every time you play.
According to a review on Reddit, the game is pick-up-and-play, rewards repeated playthroughs, and has a very unique aesthetic. It is also known for being tough-but-fair.
Metacritic praises The Binding of Isaac, stating that it successfully achieves everything it sets out to do. The story is interesting, the gameplay is fantastic, and the art and music are wonderful.
However, a negative review on Reddit mentions that the game can be a bit tedious, especially with the backtracking required after clearing out a floor.

Overall, The Binding of Isaac has received positive reviews for its gameplay, aesthetics, and challenging nature. It offers a unique and engaging experience for players who enjoy dungeon-crawling and roguelike games.",1702615079,1702615079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But under that gruff exterior, he is actually a wobbling mound of jelly. Our pal Gruff the jelly man must wobble his way around the basement and a demonic womb, fighting a bunch of angry demons and their sickly looking pals.

Unfortunately for our chum Gruff McJellyman, his wibbly legs make him less manouverable than an asthmatic sloth, and his wobbly arms mean that swinging anything bigger than a toothpick is a real struggle for our intrepid hero. Even more unfortunate for our dashing dispatcher of ne'er do wells, the villainous villains he encounters have some deviously diabolical tricks up their muscular sleeves.

Every one of these no good rascals comes equipped with an invisible record player, which they stand upon. What this means for mighty Jellyman is that all these cads he encounters can swivel on the spot... without moving their feet! The KNAVES! The SCOUNDRELS! The UTTER CHEEK! Our poor hero must face large, brutish enemies, who hide behind mighty shields, have vast qauntities of health, and who only give miniscule openings in their defence. These dastardly fiends laugh at our delicious Jelly hero, for they know that further down the corridor, two more of their identical brethren lie in wait - and our gruff protagonist must face them all, lest he be overwhelmed! Oh the horror...

Although, it's not all bad news for our gelatinous champion.
On his quest, he is accompanied by his best pal, Jam, the friendly invisible cameraman! Jam eagerly follows Jelly Goat Gruff on his delectable adventures. Unfortunately, Jam gets a little giddy whenever his pal Jellyman charges into battle, and can't keep a firm grip on his camera.
Also accompanying our damn tasty chum is Karlo...Kaslo?...Carlos? Whatever. Our ABSOLUTELY memorable pal Karlos freed the magnificent Jellygruff from his horrible jelly prison, where our hero was placed after attempting a coup against the Ice Cream king, to supplant him from the delicious dessert throne. Mage-o Kazooie brings Gruff McJellyjelly to Keystone to fight the nasty demons, because only he, with his superior reflexes, nimble footwork, and masterful weapon-handling, can save the day from EVIL!

Our gastronomical hero also gains assistance from an amiable demon blacksmith!
""I can inscribe your weapons with runes to make them worthy of Gods!"", he proudly claims.
Lo and behold!, Jellyman was overjoyed to find that his now godly weapon turned a monster that previously took 12 hits to kill, into a monster that now takes a measly 11 hits to vanquish.

Oh yeah, there's also this woman, Yetka or something. She definitely wasn't as memorable as Kazoozle, the COMPLETELY memorable shop dude. Also, there was some bad dude who's name began with M. But who cares, he was just a butthole.


Dare you join the mighty Jellyman on his quest?

Dare you battle these fearsome record player equipped demons?

Dare you slog through dozens and dozens of said demons, over and over again?

Dare you wrestle with the dreadful beast known as the inventory?

Dare you attempt to make sense of cryptic item descriptions that tell you nothing of
an item's purpose?

Dare you listen to grim and chilling audio logs?

Dare you battle visually identical, yet stastically superior versions of foes you have
already fought?

Dare you behold Jam's shaky camera-work, while keeping your dinner intact?

Dare you become... THE JELLYGRUFF?",1702246570,1702246570,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Issac is not a game. Issac is a way of life. The strangle-hold this game has on my life is unparalleled. It is not about me being unable to put down Issac, I can very well be in the mood or not in the mood for Issac, its about when I am Invested in Issac. I wake up with my goals in mind clear as day and I crave the dopamine rush I receive from calculating the perfect play. Blasting through rooms with ease knowing the run will end soon and I will have to restart from ground zero yet again. The grind is simple to understand, hard to execute. The game also shows logic constantly, giving the player items early in the run to test the player's thinking. A flight book could be given to the player with zero value in sight, only to be validated 20 minutes later in the run. The Binding of Issac talks to you. It communicates with you. Are you listening?

The game of Issac is simple, and someone new can get countless hours discovering all of the enemies, items, synergies, secrets, rules, etc. As that player grows, the rules of Issac can bend and contort to new unknown levels. I have 721+ hours in Issac (Steam time + Flash Issac days) and every time I play Issac I learn something new. I have also had the pleasure of sharing Issac with my girlfriend. I generally don't talk about Issac, probably due to the game being so weird, but I introduced Issac to my girlfriend and she also fell in love. That's when I understood that Issac is a universal joy. A simple game that can be enjoyed and loved by the young and old. Much like a fine wine, Issac matures as time passes. 

If I were on a desert island, and I could only bring one game, I would bring Issac. It's not even my favourite game, damn near close, however. It's simply because Issac is Infinite. I adore you Issac and Edmund McMillen and all of the developers for Issac. Long live the greatest piece of media that ever existed.",1701940891,1701940929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Очень интересный сюжет, классная музыка и персонажи которые имеют свою механику, особенно Альт персонажи, это самое то что бы почувствовать от игры вызов, но и по игре самой много что можно сказать, огромное разнообразие врагов, боссов, и концовки которые полностью рассказывающие сюжет дают игре настоящий потенциал, за моё проведенное время в игре я сразу готов сказать, что игра сделана отлично.

Here are some of pros and cons;

+++Pros+++:
 
-Best replayability you'll ever find in a video game.
-Some synergies are really fun to play.
-Workshop modding makes it easier to modify sounds/musics or even add characters/floors/utilities like item descriptions.
-New difficulty added with the tainted version of characters.
-New online feature (currently in beta). 

---Cons---: 

-Require a lot of knowledge to not ruin your run with bad synergies (or use Platinumgod / description mod).
-Can be hard at first for beginners.
-Maybe too many endings (i mean to properly understand the lore).
-Achieving dead god will take you a huge amount of time if you're a new (but completionist) player.
