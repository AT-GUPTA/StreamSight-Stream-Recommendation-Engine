Smallands started out very strong and was releasing updates faster than any game I've seen. The problem is that the updates were released without much substance or testing. Big areas bereft of life or things to do in them, enemies with broken hitboxes or too high of Def/hp and that disengaged mid fight to fully heal, etc. 
It's a shame too as you can see in my review below because Smallands started out extremely strong. As of right now given the amount of issues facing the game I would hold off on buying it as it is frustraing in its current state however if the Devs do remedy these major concerns that the community has been facing, I would change my mind and advise you to pick this game up. 

Tldr; This game started out super strong and has continued to add new features, weapons, mounts and means of playing faster than most developers. It is an absolute love letter to its player base. I have seen so many player suggestions implemented throughout the updates. Games like Smallland do not come around often and developers that care as much as they do even more rare. you owe it to yourself to play this game and get active with the community. Hope to see you soon.


---Original Review--
[No Spoilers]
Short and sweet: Excellent survival with great flying (gliding) mechanics, fair and well scaled enemies + bosses, and a well thought out map. It also has some nice crafting.

The nitty gritty: Smallland is what ground should have been. This survival game has some phenomenal things about it that I really want to highlight before drawing attention to what I have found needs fixing/improvement.

The map. It is a large map for an Early Access title. I found myself impressed with how resources were spread out and how traversal was difficult (until mid game) which I very much enjoyed. Items that are farther away gain meaning and value. I also think that the speed to which the game unfolds and when you gain the ability to move across the map faster comes at a great pace; After all, you wouldn't appreciate things being easy if you haven't endured them being hard at first. 9/10 Give me more!

The Controls/Combat: With controller most things felt responsive and tight (except the settings menu.) The responsiveness helped to enjoy the game and do well in combat despite the AI of the enemies being a tad wonky. Many battles felt exactly as hard as I thought they should be and I found myself being well compensated especially after the BH fight. This is an important aspect in a game because if the player either has constant challenge or is not rewarded, the combat feels meaningless and empty. The enemy AI does need fine tuning. I'm looking at you beetle types. Frequently I was attacked while flanking the enemy. Their butt doesn't attack and that was aggravating. I also thought some enemy types were far too dodgy for what they were; They felt more intelligent than they should be. Sneaking also does not feel like it has any effect and you go drastically slower when sneaking so their should be some trade-off there. 7/10 Not too shabby.

The Story: Smallland opens up with an alchemist who is missing some key to open a chest and from there you go on a wild goose chase looking for it. The story is extremely short with only a small handful of side quests. I was not engaged by the story in the slightest but this was not a problem for me as the content of the game and its flushed out mechanics picked up the slack. 4/10 

Music: The background music is not bad but nothing to write home about. I like the style especially during storms however because of the nature of a survival game is to just bingeplay for hours on end, the music started to get tedious. I'd like to see a little variety in battle scores and overworld music. 

Crafting: This area needs a little bit of love. That is not to say the crafting is bad. It isn't but many of the current recipes do not make sense or do not balance the work of gathering the materials vs the effect of the potion or the decoration for your home. A certain hopping enemy drops 1-2 of the item needed in a health potion which only 3 of which are on the map (and far apart) that recipe yields 1 Potion. that doesn't logic to me. That potion better be a big gulp or it should yield more OR the enemy, given how large it is, should drop more of that resource. Some food items like the beetleheart and its respective food Beetle Sausage, an early game item and craft, is arguably the best food item in the game as it yields 2 servings unless all else (save for one other) and the items are right there. I think other cooking crafts should yield more servings specifically the ones that use flour and fruit. Those items are in large quantity and far apart from each other. The player benefits more from hunting beetles that are close to starting area and widely available throughout the entire map. The weapons crafting is good and the taming mechanic is decent. I think that you need to be able to stable (and breed [oh yes, let me breed em please]) the tames as you will spend more time hunting down the materials for the taming food than you will with the creature as they find quick ways to die somehow. 7/10

Overall I really enjoyed Smallland despite the short story and I feel these guys are committed to developing the game and not leaving it abandoned like many other EA titles. I really enjoy the gliding mechanic. So smooth. I also thought the ability to build a base (another well flushed out mechanic in terms of rotation and placement) and to be able to move the whole thing to other tree was freaking awesome! Extremely unique. Well done. I am hoping to come back soon to a lot of content. Thank you Merge Games Dev team and thank you for reading this.

I bought this game the day it launched in EA.  I desperately want to love this game - but I can't play it.  ""Wait until full launch,"" I told myself, ""it'll be much better after they iron out the issues with it.""

TL;DR: It isn't.  It's just twice as expensive now.

The UI is ridiculously clunky, like something made in the late 90s. With patch after patch to add more and more CONTENT, one would think the devs would have a moment to have made a usable UI FIRST - but they chose not to.

I literally can't get through character/world creation.  ""Full controller support"" my a$$.  It doesn't even have full M&K support!!  Some options, you have to use a keyboard, with no other option for gamepad users (like the name of your character or world).  Some options, the mouse refuses to click on, but the controller will select it.  Backing out of a menu is next to impossible with EITHER, and puts you at the top of the options list anyway, so good luck scrolling back through the terribly-designed UI once again to get to the wrong color hair your mouse/controller accidentally hovered over because the UI can't perceive what you're trying to actually select...

I shelved this game for A YEAR expecting it to get better, and it's still unplayable, and now others who didn't buy it in EA have to pay $30 for it. 

At least I got the EA price of $15.

I LOVE the premise of this game.  I love the idea of playing as a Fae creature (I am a Pixie, after all).  Love the idea of being tiny, and exploring the ""fall of the giants (humankind).""

It would be excellent - if they took a moment to make it playable, instead of only jacking up cost for a mediocre game even if it WAS still in EA.  For a full release?  This is crap.  Stinky, smelly, unplayable crap.

Hard pass.  Fix your game before you call it a 1.0 launch.  

Play Grounded if you want to be tiny and explore human things from ant size. Play Enshrouded or Vallheim if you want to build. Play Nightengale if you want to be in Fae realms.

I have taken a look at most of these ""Mixed"" reviews and I am not happy in the slightest, but those are people's opinions. And just like opinions, everyone has one. DO NOT!!!! I REPEAT, DO NOT take their words into consideration to try and discourage you from getting this game. They didn't like it because they are spoiled and they are mad that they can't live in their unrealistic dream. I got this game on it's very first week of release and I will admit, sure there wasn't a whole lot of content to start off with. HOWEVER!! The Devs for this game have been on top and on time with patch updates, and have also been adding content along the way, bit by bit. 

One thing people fail to realize is they do NOT read. This game IS EARLY ACCESS!! OK? Out of all the games that are Early access, this has been the most promising yet, and the Devs do NOT charge you thousands of micro charges for ""DLC content"" (Incomplete game patches they should have done from the very beginning and are now charging you for it and then labeling it DLC) like how other Developers to other games do to their players. 

Sometimes you have to be patient and appreciate what is currently available in this game at the moment. I have had so much fun in this game that I am looking forward and cannot wait for more content to come out. 

To anyone giving this game a bad review, stay mad, stay salty. This game is amazing that it has this much content in it already compared to other games that have been ""Early access."" And this Dev team, I feel really cares about their gamers, and these Devs are passionate in what they create, just like how the golden days of video games were in the Early 2000's. I don't know how old some of you are, but for us older ones, you need to remember that the greatest games took 3 or 4 years to make, with music, with art, with 3D imaging, story writing, and all the in between stuff. Video games are not meant to be bomb rushed to the shelves as soon as they have left the writers office. All of you children need to be patient and appreciate that you were able to get a slight taste of fun and excitement of how this game will be when it is fully released. If I was able to somehow rate this game other than the ""like button,"" I would give this game 10 fingers up. 

On the plus side you get a game that is $15 right now and not have to pay full price when this game does get a full release.  But if you aren't sure about this game, do yourself the favor and look up NON BIASED reviews of this game and make the decision for yourself in what you do. Don't come here to complain about it. Reach out to the Devs if you have bugs, crashes, issues or anything else. Publishing your issues here and leaving a bad review without even attempting to talk to the Devs about it is down right disrespectful. The Devs cant really fix your problems or issues if they don't know about them. Have a conversation with people, ask for newsletter updates, leaving a bad review before even talking to them harms the progress of this game having a full release like how some of you are complaining about. And also shortens the number of players to play this game, which then ruins a really good thing for other players and ruins the Devs future projects.

I just felt I had to add to something that was a concern for me before purchasing. The game looks great. For some reason, the character model's quality is not on par with the rest of the world's graphics, which made me think the graphics were going to be worse than they are. It's all moot, as once your character starts wearing armor, you don't see the original model anymore anyway.

Also, Smalland is often compared to Grounded, for obvious reasons. For me, Grounded was okay, but felt like I was playing a children's game. Smalland doesn't feel like a children's game.

The grind for resources isn't awful, the repair system is forgiving, combat is really bare-bones but not altogether boring. Bug animations aren't Grounded-level but they're decent. Gear progression is interesting; your armor you're going to craft at NPCs and faction leaders with the right resources, and everything else you unlock as you pick up new resources or deploy new types of crafting/production stations. The experience seems to be tailored more around RPG/exploration and less on survival, which is something I really liked about Enshrouded. On the technical side, the game seems to run well and is fairly optimized despite some minor microstutter when loading in. It even supports DLSS. Altogether I'd put it as average or slightly above for the genre.  
What's absolutely *terrible* is the faction contribution system and faction rewards. To my knowledge, contribution points can *only* be accrued by completing world events, which will often have you facing a large wave of a given type of insect. This can be challenging when playing solo, sure, but the real kick in the balls is the reward for completing said world events seems normalized around 6-9 points. When you consider world events are about 20 minutes or more apart, and reward prices (pieces of armor will run you around 30-40 each or so, same with wings, and unlocking a faction-specific buff looks like it costs a THOUSAND points), we're talking tens of hours of grinding world events just to accrue enough points for one faction's rewards.  
This needs to be tuned. This isn't an MMO or a live service game; there's no need to have that sort of grind unless it's to artificially inflate playtime to compensate for a lack of content... which is where I think this is at, given the relatively small size of the world map. There's the red flag, and it's dissuaded me from continuing. It feels as though the devs tried to push out a 1.0 as fast as possible, even though there's more content and major adjustments in the works according to the road map.

The combat is kinda stale-ish, lots of just rolling and parrying with no really varied movesets for combat. 

Food is...kinda pointless? Like, there's so much variety in things to eat, but there's no actual reason to HAVE that variety, all they do is give you nourishment. So, basically, just eat ant heads forever. In so many other survival games, what you eat matters. Valheim revolutionized this and many survival games are following in their footsteps. Smalland didn't. 

There also doesn't really seem to be an incentive to build nice homes that I can tell. When I say that, I mean for example, some games have a mechanic where the more you decorate your house, the more bonus you get, like in Enshrouded, you gain a buff to your stamina, so you really start to dedicate making your homes nice and cozy to get the biggest buff you can. In this, it's mostly just to...avoid damage from storms/heat/cold. Make a shack with a fire, you're good. 

Animations are...eh...Some bug attacks are just so fast that trying to dodge/parry them is more or less impossible, or their animation just doesn't play at all and you take damage from a stationary enemy. 

There doesn't seem to be any ways to debuff your foes outside of fire and poison, so you don't really need to plan ahead for a majority of fights. Just pick the weapon they're weak against and smack them till they stop moving, basically. 

Bug density is...intense. Really intense, I was fending off bugs more than exploring because there was just so many of them. They aren't hard to deal with, just annoying to keep fending them off.

Build from chests. Jesus christ, any survival game that doesn't have this feature drives me insane. I already know that if I continue playing, I'll need more resources, which means more chests, which means more organizing, Any time I'll want to craft something, I gotta find that thing in the exact chest.

However, I was bored.  I couldn't feel any motivation or excitement to play this game, and though I tried and put in the hours.  Other than gliding after my first set of wings, it was mundane to the point of having to play through yawns.

It needs a lot of 'upgrades' to bring it to an enjoyable game.  Least of which is the ability to fast travel to a minimum of your own base, without having to exploit logging off game to respawn there.  There are only 5 insects that you can tame at this time, note: the devs do profess to an upcoming patch with more creatures. It could use more storyline quests, and something to do other than massive grinding.  It needs to be a lot less boring.

Still, it is getting a passing review.  The design is good, play style good, and other than a few too many weather events, the world is good (if extremely limited).

Overall, this gets a solid 2.5 stars. Fully middle of the road.

Character creation is very bare bones.
The world feels kind of dead. The mob AI is stiff, turns like an awkward tank instead of a nimble insect. The harvestable resources look very basic.
A chunk of water floating above the ground above the actual water level (next to creek near starting area).
Not swimming was a bit disappointing. Takes a lot from the Open World label. And so do invisible walls (in cave near the elder).
A lot of the foliage is walk through. Easier to move around but the way is done takes away from the immersion.
The sound effect for demolishing building pieces is awful. Like someone forgot to change it before launch. 
You have to read the dialogues, no big deal but the NPCs come across very stiff (A bit of animation goes a long way). Adding to that dead feeling.

So far mechanically grounded is better, more polished. So there is still a nish for the small fantasy world faery style to be filled.

The character design is nice, especially if more depth is given to character creation. Specifically in face paint, head and body types (we love sliders).
Love the design of the elder that looks like a moth. A more elaborate faery village would be great. It felt a bit monotonous around the camp. The colours of the world are a bit flat, a bit more saturation here and there maybe. The ground textures are a bit bare looking too.
Would love to see it improve.

TDLR- Great game! just be aware it is 1.0 and has faults, though they are doing future reworks when you look at their recent roadmap, hopefully the next story is fun and they keep improving the game.

The new tutorial is much simpler all thanks to one of the NPCs being a mini Wikipedia for you. Beforehand for me I had spent 2 hours roughly figuring out what tools to get for certain materials though it was satisfying going from sticks to iron. Tip of advice for new players, always try to carry resin, wood and fiber to build a work bench to repair your tools whenever and wherever so you never have to spend actual material to repair it. ALSO those giant trees with mushrooms circling it? those are great trees, you can place your base there and you can constantly move it to another great tree so you do not have to break or move bases so much till you get to the last 2 zones.

[b] Visual's [/b]
This is not a cartoon style feel (like grounded) this is more towards realism especially for the environment, it is stunning. Though the snow I wish was not so blinding in some areas like the desert. The game also has what is called antenna mode, I heard people complain about how obnoxious this was and I understand though for me they have fixed the graphics on it so it is not so blinding when you switch to it. Plus the more you play the more you won't use the mode it just becomes instinct to know where things are. Environmental and NPC designs are amazing though I wish they added way more customization to your small folk, their new road-map does not appear to have more customization and armor in the future so if you like that be aware you have a small pool of customization. (Though you are in armor majority of the time near 1/4 of the game so you wont see your small folk as much.) 
[b]My specs[/b] I run everything on ultra and I DO get small stutters my partner gets hard stutters but plays on low, be aware you WILL get those spikes when loading into a new zone or reloading. (not so bad just a second or 2 of a frame stutter)
CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 X
GPU- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060

[b]Gameplay[/b]
They have greatly improved the fighting mechanics in the game and the physics. Beforehand if you fell into water you would have only 2-5 seconds till insta-death. (People surprised they die when a bug would suffer the same fate. you ARE small lol) They now give you ample time to get out as soon as possible! just avoid water. Blocking and dodging are great just gotta time blocking and not run out of stamina, you need enough stamina to block but you could constantly dodge if you are in a pickle. Overall the bugs are really fun to go against or tame, just fun to run into them and question if they are nice or not. (aka kill every hornet you see, this your time to shine your hatred towards them). 8/10 Could use some improvements and give a sound timing signal more easily but not that frustrating, though still mad they nerfed the damage on weapons. One thing I do hear alot of is the tames, A certain tame has werid controls but you get use to it the more you ride your new friend though the tames are abit funky at times when they follow you so be aware of that lol. Also be mindful that some enemies DO get stuck in their spawns, this is more important when you reach the latest area, use the antenna mode and you most likely can kill them through the walls to clear them out. (when you get to the desert hopefully you'll remember this tidbit and they fix this).

[b]Story (1.0)[/b] (NO SPOILERS)
I wish we gotten more, its a serve able 7/10 story at the current moment, I wish we've gotten voice acting from the NPCs to hear their characters personality and to give abit more feel into the world were in. I do want more scenes with all the NPC to know more about THEM and the world were in where it doesn't feel like info-dumping so much ya know? The only one I felt alot and loved being around was Lisandra with her whole spider vibes and how she cares for them greatly. (Yes they do have arachnophobia mode though from what I've heard from those that have arachnophobia it barely helped so be mindful). The legit only reason you talk to the NPCs is to progress the quest and to get your recipes, some are JUST for recipes.... though I loved the cut-scenes and did tear up abit at the end. (most likely cause its been almost a year of playing and I finally gotten the end of the 1.0 story, I hope there is more im now more curious about our world then anything.) Though they do add mystery pretty well when your on your quest from the burrows!

[b]Fun/Replay Ability[/b] & [b]Building[/b]
I do keep coming back to the game every time I hear an update is coming back or when I want to grind out for the factions now or build! Overall its a 8-9/10 The building lets you be REALLY creative once you realize you can do advance sizing and rotations you can do anything you want! Really this lies mostly on if you have friends or a partner to play with that adds more to the replay ability to the game and even building, the new world events and factions added more into it! I can not wait to see what else they add to keep the replay ability going, though for me I always loved fantasy and fae so this was easy for me to fall in love with. 

At the end of the day get the game if you are perfectly fine constant grinding for materials, building, fighting bugs and exploring, you can have fun in this game if you look for it. Though be aware some bugs that were reported before 1.0 dropped are still active (I've seen/reported new ones before that are still there like the chest UI not lining up suddenly or deleting metal nodes when placing the work bench lol). Sorry if this did not answer ALL your questions and concerns though if it did I hope you have fun and hopefully I may see you in the burrows too!",1690131407,1708728339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can level them, but they can die permanently for nonsense reasons. Stupid idea. On top, they don't obey when you call them out of a fight with the whistle. Not to mention, that they aggro anything in range.  That they spawn with you in your camp/house and block you, is quite annoying too. With the pets fixed, it could be recommendation. Pets perma dying is a complete no-go. I'd suggest an option for going unconscious instead of dying and a penalty for going unconscious, that can be reduced with a recipe made from common stuff.

More stuff that needs fixing:
-the conversation options with the liftboy need to go. One click for the elevator should be enough.
-don't spawn anyone at Hildred who already had a treehouse. Spawn them at the last owl used or whatever. Wasted literally half an hour, spawning me there once. Neither fun nor funny 
-the foods seem super generic copy and paste
-private treehouse should not prevent the use of workbenches, or there should be a seperate option

There are many positive points too though. The combat is nice. The building system is nice (nicer than valheim vanilla, less nice than valheim with the plus mod). The flying is very nice.

The game is good but its still EA as many already said.
Without guides its really interesting to discover everything by yourself, world is huge at first.
But there are too many small gameplay problems that could be fixed easly, but for some reason they nor. 

Like why you cant craft multiple times? I mean its anooying and its especially annoying when you get to the only ""gun"" in the game. You literally need to click 71 time to craft 10 ammo SEVENTY ONE!!!! (x10 sulphur, x20 saltpeter, x10(or x20) charcoal for powder, x10 powder, x5 charcocal for iron, x5 iron + x1 to craft ammo) to craft 1 banch of the ammo which you will spend faster than you craft it =) 

Fighting is still boring after you get your first set of armor and weapons, block is useless you can just parry everything in the game with anything, so if you are good with timings you can beat the game with wooden sword.

Leveling system does nothing impactfull, I 100% the game and I went full intelegence....well...I was crafting for 3 guys in my group and we crafted every single set and we only saw 3 rarity types and it was like only 20% of the gear I crafted, what is the point of that? Its like max 5% better than original stats + without intelegence you cant repair or upgrade your gear.

Right from the start of the game you can unlock ""hornet treat"" aaand world is not that big anymore, with unlocking ""blue tit"" its even smaller... I mean thats one of the reasons why endgame locations feels so empty and boring.

The game was a diamond when it first came out, just tune few things, fix bugs and add new content, there was absolutly no need in adding and buffing such flying mounts they literally ruin all the fun of the exploring this huge world. At least add the setting to disable flying mounts. Blue tit must be disabled completly, hornet just a bit of the nerf to its stamina.

Creature levels means nothing, leveling your ""pets"" means nothing.

Factions are just pure crap. Why every single event gives you 6 points? Its like every ~30-40 mins you can farm 6 points. How the hell do you suppose to farm 1k for only ONE faction + farm for some gear to buy from them? 10 points for 5 hoods if I remember correctly, what is a point of that? You need hoods only in late game, in late game you get 5-10 hoods from the killing of NPC's + 5 hoods for 20 purite or w/e its called, that can be farmed like 500 in under 15 mins.

Final location with the final boss can be skipt entirely with blue tit, you can simply just fly straight to the boss.

I mean just a few tweaks to all of that and the game would be perfect (still many tweaks for the endgame, since its super empty and boring).",1708457004,1708457004,False,11,0,0.592759788036346436,0,True,False,False

- Great world design, attention to detail on locations
- Soundtrack bangers

Cons:
- Gameplay is basic and buggy
- Poor game feel
- Lots of bugs (not the insect kind)
- Steam achievements are bugged at the moment, I know some of them I should have but it won't unlock so I will never have 100% in this game
- Not so good optimisation. Game can lag very badly even on low settings, mind you my rig isn't weak either.
- Gameplay scaling
- Combat is pretty dull which can get very boring fast
- Updates are underwhelming

Although my review may be negative now, I am still going back to this game once it updates again and play till the story's end. I may change my review in the future if the game redeems itself.

Pros: the design and world is amazing. i had a lot of fun exploring this world and surviving. i really enjoyed the building and the tree bases. i didnt have any major bugs so far on my end either

Cons: the combat is meh. its hard to tell sometimes wich enemies can be killed easy and wich ones are too dangerous. the level doesnt really tell a whole lot about the enemy.  [spoiler] the endgame is underwhelming. when i fought the endboss i was excited to see the armor and wings. even the Whip looked badass. and whats the reward for finishing? a measly sword (great design but thats it) and new wings. the wings look great but thats also it. you save the kingdom for a sword that cant even do anything special. wow and why did i do that again? this whole update felt rushed as hell. please Devs this cant be it. you can do better im sure [/spoiler]",1708428904,1708428904,False,4,0,0.520348846912384033,0,True,False,False

However, there are some issues I have regarding the creatures you encounter. For instance a gecko is easier to deal with than a wasp and a wolf spider is easier to deal with than what they call a jumping spider. Big issue I have there is a wolf spider is a jumping spider and in this game is far larger than way they call a jumping spider. That makes he entire encounter backwards. I fear a smaller less intimidating creature, because it is almost impossible to dodge and over powered. So while there is a good deal of creatures, they are not terribly true to life. Another example, grey flies do piercing damage, and a fair amount at that. In reality flies are not able to bit let alone to pierce a victim. They spit an enzyme that helps breakdown food that is already dead/processed, much like human saliva. So Poison damage would be a better option. There is also not a great deal of guidance on where to find the next tier of resources so getting to higher tiers of the game can be a bit of a mystery.

I like this game, it has the potential to be one of the best survival games there is but right now that potential has consistently been fallen short of. Updates are released with content that always feels a little under-cooked and unpolished. The game community gives feedback, that feedback is not implemented and the devs go on to the next bit of planned content without addressing the issues brought up by the players.
[h2]Pros[/h2]
Building system works and you can make some fun and impressive bases. It's not the most in-depth or broad building in a survival game but it works well and I have no complaints.
Visuals are great, very nice to explore and look around at stuff.
Traversal of the land is fun, grappling hook, wings, different mounts lots of options and movement overall feels pretty good.
[h2]Cons[/h2]
Rarity system has not changed since it was implemented, it is tied to the intelligence stat which in itself wouldn't be the worst thing but if you create a legendary piece of equipment you have to maintain a high int stat otherwise when you repair it the item will downgrade from legendary quality. No one liked this system many solutions were offered, no changes were made.
Armor is still inventory when equipped, extra slots were added so it technically isn't taking up extra space but it shows a lack of skill that they couldn't make it disappear from the inventory when equipped.
Factions seem dead on arrival the amount of time needed to invest into them to get rewards seems like a way the devs wanted to padd out the length of the game and the rewards you get from them despite taking ten times the time to create than any other piece of equipment are the exact same so they arn't even worth the grind. [spoiler] a perfect example of this is the sword Queen's Grace you get as a reward for completing the story of the game, it looks very impressive but has the exact same stats as the viper sword you can make yourself with the only difference being 5 block power. No unique effects or anything, very underwhelming for the reward for completing the game but par for the course [/spoiler]
That goes into rewards in the game. Rewards arn't worth the time investment, armor is all the same, weapons are all the same with no real differences between any of them especially since you can upgrade lower tier armor and weapons to be just as good as stuff you unlock at end game. There are no unique effects for weapons, no set bonus or gear effects for armor. ""It looks cool"" could define the entire design philosophy behind the game where differences between any piece of armor are really only surface-deep.
AI for enemies is bad and has never been changed or improved. On 1.0 release the devs reduced the player damage which in theory makes combat harder but really it just makes it take longer. There are maybe three enemies in the game with decent combat AI that makes them do anything besides face tank all your attacks.
The devs finally added ranged attackers to the game, but only in the final zone, they needed to go back and add weaker variants to let the player get used to fighting them and also spice up older zones.
The tame system for getting mounts is undercooked, they constantly get in your way when harvesting rescources and there isn't a lot you can actually do with them with most being terrible at combat and rushing int without you telling them only to die. Not all species of tames are equal with their being clear better choices and ones you'd never take for any reason other than cosmetic.
Not enough reasons to explore (traversal and exploration is one of the few well done and fleshed out things in the game but their arn't enough reasons to explore. There are a few cosmetic things scattered around, a few unlockable weapons, and a scavenger hunt to complete midway through the game but there is so much more that could be done here)

I like this game, I'm not mad about its shortcomings I'm sad because it could be so much more. Right now I'd say this game is around a 5/10 game but if they fix just a few of these issues it could easily jump to an 7, 8 or 9 out of 10.

Some cons;
• You can craft from chests. Its pretty annoying to always have to grab materials from chests especially since the crafting trees seems to be a bit long.

• You have to interact with each chest to store things, would be nice to have a command to just put like materials in chests close to the character.

• A bit buggy. in some areas I've clipped right through rocks. The bugs get stuck too in rocks and their spawning holes.

• Now, this might just be me but it really feels like you should be able to climb up things. Perhaps an item or something. Then again I'm only 9.4 hours in the game so w'll see. 

• If you choose the option to loose things when you die and you die in water.. you're S.O.L

Some Pros;
• As you progress and can harvest higher tiered items you don't only get new materials but lower tiered ones in that same category. Makes going around gathering things way more rewarding.

• Higher tiered tool degrade slower

• You can warp your whole base to different certain locations, that's a huge help when farming. Find a plentiful area? well just move in next door.

I really hope this game will get some updates, and not be a ""here's a 1.0 release, now we'll let it die"" game.

The good:
- Graphics are pretty nice
- World design is interesting and exploration-worthy
- Music is SUPRISINGLY good !!!
- Netcode is on point, no lag/desyncs/crashes
- Building stuff works well
- User interface is easy to understand and functional

The less good:
- Animations are VERY clunky, and lack a lot of dynamism. You can't quite tell when you're hitting something or not
- Pretty sure the climbing/ledge grab mechanic is just the same UE template used in Only Up, feels ""meh""
- Because of animations, the combat really feels poor and cheesy. Rolling and parrying is WAY too easy to feel rewarding.
There's some interesting aspects tho, but they definitely need improvements
- Hitboxes are pretty bad, both for combat but also when gathering resources (you have to sometime look for a sweet spot to hit a rock with your pickaxe, otherwise you'll never it and swing in the void, or just mine some weird invincible hitbox of the rock... ?!)
- No way to have shared map pinpoints accross players in coop.
- No way to actually see your buddies in coop on the compass (you just have a lens flare when they're close, but if you get too far, you have to open the map to see them). EDIT: It's actually possible, you need to click on the player's icon on the map.
- You can see your pet's health bar on the UI, but not the health bars of your coop friends. Why ?
- You can't pet your mount, and need to nearly beat him to death before even getting a chance to tame him. This a dumb and useless mechanic, and the game doesn't even tell you about it
- You can't heal your coop buddies, and actually, there's barely any coop interaction at all with other players, besides sharing resources at the base, sharing aggro in combat, and going pyjama party to skip the night, minecraft style
- Exploit : [spoiler]You can cheese the hell out of of any tool's durability if you have enough wood to craft a workbench and repair everything constantly[/spoiler]

Keep in mind the Devs of this game count as indie developer. There is probably not a 500 soul strong crew behind the whole project. Therefore go easy on the guys.

I've played the game in EA and now started in 1.0 with a friend.
The rubberbanding and lagging i have read about i can't agree there. We have no lags or stuff.
When we reached the ""main village"" it stuttered for a moment, but i guess it was just loading in, since after those few seconds everything went smooth.

When you look for a super deep, narrative story i guess this is not the place. The story of Smalland is fun, the game world is lovely to explore.
Grounded sure is another one of ""those"" survival titles, but i must say that both are different, a different approach, which makes both very special.

If you ask me, check the game out. The content so far is nice, take your time, don't rush through and such. (Seen reviews complain about no finished story after 13 hours). Enjoy the ride and trust me, the Devs follow up on their promises with updates and all.

It's an enjoyable little game which has a pretty robust building system and very cute art style. Usually I play with friends and we really embrace the ""RP"" part of the Survival RPG. 

- Since it launched, the map has gotten about twice as big in size and there's a lot to explore, find, tame, and create, with more promised in future updates.
- LOTS of build pieces to discover that can be rotated in any direction for a lot of creative freedom. Build your perfect little fairy house!
- Progression is straightforward. Most areas aren't quest-locked, so if you have the right gear, you can just go explore them! It's not a complicated game, which makes it fun to unwind in. 
- There's no real quest tracker, and because the game is so small it can be hard to find helpful guides online. But the story is pretty simple. All the important quest NPCs get marked on your map and can be tracked from your compass.
- I see a lot of complaints that its a little buggy, and it does sometimes bork out on me in small, mildly inconveniencing ways, but I would consider it largely stable. I haven't encountered anything game-breaking or progress-blocking in 70+ hours of playtime. 
- It's a great world design if you want to just enjoy running around as a little guy and not have to think *too* hard about balancing stats or spend 800 years grinding for resources. Early game is harder than late game, because you get a lot more tools and mobility as you progress, but enemies scale well to your level between areas to keep fights challenging in higher-difficulty zones.

any and all the controls can be re-mapped, I played with mouse and keyboard.

solo player - is really good, you can mark your map for resource areas, where you built your houses / stash space
private multi-player = see above issues, otherwise really good, creature get harder but not too much and resource gathering is increased dramatically.
trading is done by either dropping things on the floor for other players to pick up or
you can place the items in a stash chest and they can get them out of there.

Pros: [b]#1.[/b] The environment is beautiful (Note that I say 'environment' and not anything else like the characters+enemies+UI because those are really bad, especially the UI)

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] The game's performance is literally the worst that I've EVER seen. The game uses 100% of my 3080RTX at 310Watts, when running the game on Medium at 1080p. This game's performance makes Starfield look like Tetris. It makes Crysis look like Minesweeper. It is absolutely baffling how bad the game runs. I've NEVER seen a game use 310Watts at 1080p.
[b]#2.[/b] When you use the 'resource sense' ability, the entire screen goes grey and your view distance is massively limited. Considering that you're going to spend probably 30% of your entire playtime with this 'resource sense' activated, it just doesn't make any sense that it makes the entire game look like dog crap. They could have made the ability's activation FX much much more subtle and then you could atleast still appreciate the game's visuals.
[b]#3.[/b] The character creator is low effort and feels tacked-on just so that the devs can say that their game has a 'character creator' in their marketing materials. I mean, you get 3 (bad) tattoo choices and you can't even change the color of the tattoos.
[b]#4.[/b] The game has bugs, one of which is that resources spawn inside the ground.
[b]#5.[/b] You can't scale walls or even slight inclines at all, which massively limits exploration.
[b]#6.[/b] The game doesn't have Borderless Fullscreen or Borderless Window display options, which is terrible.
[b]#7.[/b] The game has attribute points, but no skill points or talent system.
[b]#8.[/b] Gear + weapons + tools have durability. This literally only serves to slow down the game and make it more obtuse.
[b]#9.[/b] When you chop a tree or break a rock, the resources fall on the ground and roll away from you if you are on even a 5% incline... and this happens OFTEN, so you sometimes spend more time chasing after your resources than actually chopping down a tree.

The ""tutorial"" are these glowing owl statues that just have some text for various mechanics within the game.  As far as I can tell, you aren't pushed or required to actually do anything to progress through the tutorial phase of the game.

What is an instant ""no"" as far as recommendation is how bad the combat is.  Enemies are LOCKED onto you, they literally slide around sideways across the surface as you move around.  Once locked on, the only way to avoid damage is to somewhat perfectly time your dodge-rolls or blocks.  If you don't, they will hit you regardless of how much range or if you're jumping....  because they are locked on, you will get hit.

The mounts are an interesting addition to this type of game, but they aren't balanced well.  You can (and should) get the Grasshopper first and very quickly in order to reduce many of the frustrations while playing.  You can pretty early ""cheat"" and find out how to get a flying mount pretty early which also makes a massive difference.

That said, mounts are also pretty clunky or janky at best.  You have to tell them to ""stay"" constantly other they will make it difficult to harvest resources since they try to sit on top of you while you run around.  They will ""bug out"" and run all over the place and aggro random stuff getting themselves (or you) killed.

Still clunky, still have to choose between having arrows or hook on grappling hook equipped, bow is to important makes grappling hook a horrible tool, and sure when you get hornets and catapults and wings you can travel quickly but you cannot still ""Climb"" on terrain unlike conan exiles or heck even palworld now.

Inventory managment the fact your gear in the inventory thats on hotkey bar or even equipped on your body takes up space makes just things meh again because you need to go to and from base.

I tried, I really tried to get the developers to reconsider hotbar items as an additional line of inventory space and gear worn shouldnt take up space. but nope.

So to sum it up:

The idea and concept is good, but the execution is meh. Inventory managment is meh, to low on space for a survival/builder game, the fact that grappling hook uses the ammo slot of arrows is meh, the fact you cannot climb on trees and cliffs is meh, the game does have amazing charm and fun concept but it isnt enough.

First off, the grind in this game is incredibly tedious. Harvesting stuff takes longer than it should, and they even nerfed harvesting damage recently by exempting the player stat buffs from increasing harvest damage. You also need a metric ton of certain resources, and some resources are quite rare and require extensive searching.

The crafting is even worse, because there is little to no QoL to speak of. No crafting from storage that Grounded, Palworld, Valheim with a simple mod, and many more games in this genre, have. No pinning recipes to make it easier to pull out the right ingredients from your 10 chests. No hot deposit to nearby containers (Grounded has this). All in all, making the crafting process far more cumbersome than it ought to be.

The story is basically non-existent; some flavour text here and there. There is a mount system, which showed promise, but ultimately most of them are pretty useless. Only one I used more than a couple times was the grasshopper, but they have very low hp and die quickly.

There are still very annoying bugs present that were reported almost a year ago, such as an inredibly aggressive depth of field effect that resets to max every single time you go back to the menu, or restart the game.

Overall - fun game.  However... being early access I hope some things get some massive attention.
~ the repair system is fine at first, but then gets tedious. I wish it would change to ""repairs at a great tree, are free, no matter damage, but repairs out in the wild, cost"" repairing 10x as much, freely, means more trips back to repair, or making repair stations everywhere to quickly use and break down, which gets tedious and annoying.

~the combat is bland.  The dodge/roll isn't very useful in most of the fights, only specific ""build up attacks' you see coming and need to dodge.  Blocking, is essentially pointless as you still take too much damage, no matter the 'block strength' - so your better off just dodging, or tanking it and getting another attack in.  This could be changed if a 'parry' system was introduced, but as it is, just spamming attack is the fastest way to end fights, while having enough HP to recover for more fights.  There don't seem to be any 'i-frames' either, or very few, to avoid damage when dodge rolling, making it even less useful - and of course, there is a massive delay between 'attack' and 'dodge' that makes it hard to even make dodging viable.

~ most of the armor is.. strange.  Some offer things like regeneration - but the rate is SO LITTLE it might as well not even exist. Most of it is just 'generally the same, but looks different' - and only the ones with Wings are actually more viable as armor - as getting around on the map becomes tiresome without gliding over large sections. (even with mounts) due to the annoying amount of always-aggro bugs. I would hope this gets changed. Perhaps some can prevent fall damage, and some can help float on water, and some can do other things  instead of just ""glide"" and ""protect"" and slightly regenerate.

~ the amount of bugs, needs changed or modified. Carpenter ants in the start are so dangerous you basically need to run,  then they get so tedious to just 1 shot and get rid of.   There needs to be some progression of ""aggro to ignore unless attacked' for the bugs.  It is annoying to make your way through common enemies you've dealt with since day 1, and still have to deal with aggro and annoyances even in high tier gear (after defeating bosses and getting the Key back, in my case)

~ food is a let down.  Almost all the food is the same, just made differently.  This makes most of the food not even useful - as you will have so many of the basic ingredients to keep you satisfied.   Garlic for example, is pointless to make food of, you can just make Ant-head skewers or Mushroom Steak and be fine.  Garlic- should maybe give a reduced aggro for a time period, as a insect-repellent.   Other ingredients to do other things, of course.  Instead right now, you need lots of 30 nourish (to keep your food above 70, so you can constantly heal) and a few 50's with like cold resist (for those terrible cold winter nights) - and of course MAYBE a few 70's for if you die and need to refill your bar fast.  Other than that... food is pointless.  This should change.

~ the 'grapple gun' has no ability to pull you up or lower you down, which would be more useful. Perhaps this can be improved?  I mean swinging like spider-man is ok and all, but being able to say pull yourself up from a cliff instead of falling into water- would be much more useful.

~ Winter should be more devastating to bug populations, making almost nothing out, including cold-blooded creatures and the insects.  This is to make it harder to do much, and to keep the need to stock up before winter comes, to enable easier survival. (right now, it wasn't that big of deal)

~ a sort option for inventory , is a must.  and picking up items, should be easier - as well as recovering body should stack like items, instead of having some smaller piles take up more space.   In addition - the ""hotbar' should NOT be 'shortcuts' but actual inventory space (and it would then make plenty of space for all needs, including 3 weapons to deal with the variety of needs, especially with ladybug tame allowing another 20 slots of space needs)

But overall, I enjoyed this early access experience, the resource gathering wasn't too grindy, even to make a mostly stone base and all the facilities/workstations.  I completed the story up to what is out, and await more story to play.  I don't see myself playing more just to gather more/build more however, as it isn't very fun without some sort of goal and progress. 

If you are ok with Early Access games, and like survival, this is a pretty fun experience, especially at the price (under $30US) - and getting nearly 30 hours of play searching everywhere/doing everything I could. (including killing all boss/mini bosses)

//// Post 1.0 Launch - Feb, 15, 2024 //////
I had high hopes for this game, as my previous review was thumbs up, but now, it's not.
The combat is terrible, still, maybe worse than before thanks to the 'leveling' system.  Sure, the block/parry system helped, but it still feels too clunky and too much stamina drain.

The leveling system is a nice touch - if only you didn't seemingly nerf our beginning stats to the point of being worthless.  Spending a bunch of points to get back to how we felt, before leveling existed, not a good move.  Not sure what level cap is, if there is one - I only got to 69.

Amber Valley - feels empty, and there appears to only be 1 Viper (snake) to get materials from.. making it a choir to grind.

Gear in general needs so much Iron/resources to repair all the time, it doesn't feel fun, it feels like a grind from the moment you get hit- and you will get hit.

The AI can now walk on walls and such - a nice touch - if only they didn't get stuck so often.

As for the road map... I am not sure what wisdom had them push the '1.0 Launch event"" before ""Improved workbenches, crafting station progression, improved crafting immersion"" type changes, this sounds like a complete overhaul of the crafting system, changing it completely....  why are you planning such a drastic thing AFTER release? (road map time April 2024)

Same with the Taming Overhaul planned for ""June 2024"", this is a drastic change to the game and how it plays out... but once again - 1.0 launch already happened.

Most of the Boss Fights are... not needed to progress.. they are nice, I guess, but... seems wasteful not to tie them in.

And then there is the ""Events System"" world events happen every... 20~ish minutes, by the time you get to them, and fight them, its about every 30 minutes.  The issue is they are all the same ""a swarm of mobs has appeared, kill them all"" - and you only get 6 points each time.   Why is this so bad?  Because you need 1,000 points to get the faction bonus from any 1 faction.  That is 167 Events per faction, about 83 hours of effort.  And that doesn't even include if you purchase the Faction based items, which can also take those points.

This is an absurd grind, and not fun.  Combine with the resources needed to repair your gear (because it will drop below 50%, rather frequently with event combat) and it just.. isn't fun.

I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game, at $35 (current retail price, not on sales) at all.  It went from promising, to trash.

I am done with the game. Maybe if they can address the bad combat, the horrible grind, and the blatant attempt to pad game time with a world faction system that is the worst I have seen, then maybe I will reinstall and give it another try.

The last thing I wanna say is - the way the game starts now, the 'tutorial', is WORSE than it was in early access.  It starts you in a off branch of the map, and you find your way back to where ""I"" originally spawned in nearly a year ago -meanwhile the ants and other combat is horrible as now we feel (and might be) nerfed in our stats to allow leveling to compensate for it.

- Building bases is fun, and you can warp the whole thing in it's entirety to many new locations of current interest.
- Coop/multiplayer works completely, and lets players level and progress at their own pace.
- Fun combat, enemies, weapons, armor, and boss fights.
- Flush believable and very detailed enlarged world.
- Tons of crafting and rewards for progression.
- You can tame, level up, call upon from a far distance, and ride the wildlife.
- Flying and Tarzan swinging is a massive exploration crutch for this game, and totally fun.
- Typical pesky annoying survival mechanics are balanced better, such as food prep for eating and equipment repairing, so you are not spending all your time at a crafting bench.

You can create new bases in the different areas, or opt for a tree-based house that can be moved to other candidate trees all over the map when desired. That's a great way to avoid forcing players to build if they aren't interested in that.

Gameplay loop is very similar to what you expect from a survival/basebuilding game, you fight things, gather materials, expand base, look for new better material, rinse and repeat.

The idea works exceptionally well: You're a tiny little guy about half a centimeter tall and everything is huge in comparison to you, to the point you'll be chopping down individual flowers as if they were trees. Bees, wasps, spiders and various other bugs make for exceptionally scary monsters when you're the size of a grain of rice. Watching a wasp as large as a truck fly towards you accompanied by buzzing and clicking is quite the experience, not to mention the game looks very good and the various creatures are really well animated.

Some of the insects can be tamed, some will assist in combat, some will carry your stuff, some can be used as mounts.

Basebuilding is among the best for this kind of game, closest comparison I can draw is V Rising. You can build anywhere, but there are special trees you can claim and build on top of. Once you build on a tree, claiming a new one will transfer your entire base, with everything included.

[u][b] Gameplay [/b][/u]
The gameplay  in the game is awesome from crafting to combat and gathering.
I enjoy the grind but I am however upset there is no clan or group system in the game.
The base building system is also good and provides a way of being unique in the game in terms of styles and looks.



[u][b] Graphics/Frames [/b][/u]
The graphics could be better but i love the overall look of the world
got great frames with some drops here and there mainly spikes .
got a nice 90fps at most times.


[u][b] Progression [/b][/u]
The progressiveness is in your character stats and also things like taming pets and base-building and gear.
Also completing storyline Quests and exploring and discovering the land and its secrets.


[u][b] Final Thoughts [/b][/u]
I feel this game is Larger than expected but needs to have a Cheat Detection Engine that works and a way to make the server you play on more important rather than hop on any you want without having impact to the character your using.
The character creation needs more adding in terms of styles and looks.

[u][b] Rating out of 5 [/b][/u]

The beautiful world is kinda where it ends for me. It seems like just another game focused on crafting for the sake of crafting.

It drops you into the game like a naked baby in the woods with like zero story line to guide you. As soon as it rained, I had to seek shelter in a cave, but still quickly froze to death. After googling it, I figured out how to build a camp on top of a tree to stay warm. After that, there was nothing that drove me to explore the world any further.

The only way to survive inclement weather is by being in your camp it seems like, which makes me not want to venture to far away from it. I also wish you could adjust falling damage because it seems like a drop from ANY HEIGHT is fatal. Since the game is so unforgiving to death, most of my time was spent recovering lost loot, just to miss a mushroom and start all over.

The game needs more of a story to drive the player forward. And I honestly think it’s a little to hard to be considered a “casual” Player vs. environment crafting game. But you might enjoy it if you’re hardcore into that genre",1706015433,1706015433,False,5,1,0.456070959568023682,0,True,False,True

Food is never a problem, it stacks, doesnt spoil and you can find it everywhere. 

Storms will force you to be afk for two minutes while doing nothing. 

Repairing your tools is just a pointless chore when you can just do it for free.

The gameplay loop of going somewhere, getting a bounty and a new set of armour gets old fast. 

Trees and being able to move your base around make ir useless to ever make more than one. And respawning there after loging out makes for a annoying fast travel option.

All the armour change is in numbers, there is no gameplay differences. Improving your gear doesnt affect your gameplay at all. They should learn from Grounded and its armour sets and weapons.

The monsters aggro you from really far away and running is futile. Energy management sucks.

Building is really obtuse, you can place blueprints or move stuff around.  The ""shelter"" mechanic is just an inconvinience.

**If you're wanting this game because they have dedicated servers for window or linux now DO NOT bother. **

1.) This is the biggest issue for me so for. The devs updated the game and failed to give dedicated server owners the ability to update their files so a lot of people who have servers on windows and linux can no longer play on their servers now. Devs have stated they ""were are aware of the issue and were working on a fix"" but that was over 24 hours now. They also released the files for dedicated servers on Dropbox of all things which feels really unprofessional. There are better and safer ways to do this and the concept of private dedicated servers running on windows or linux needing to be updated should have been thought of and addressed before the files were released.

2.) There is no clan or party system with other players that you find in most multiplayer survival games. You can turn off PvP but if you play with others and want to share a house or tree base the pets that do not belong to the player who owns it will cause damage over time to it.

3.) Because there is no clan/party/group system if the player who owns the tree base logs out their base vanishes leaving everyone who was also living at that base stranded and unable to access stored loot or pets who were not in party with them at the time.

4.) They make updates to the game with out explaining what is in the update. Yes the last one was just to remove the Christmas themed parts of the game but we the players didn't know this and communication is important.",1704592848,1704599330,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

In my opinion, despite its growing pains as an early access (needing to give love to its non-survival content and have survival aspects fleshed out to be more present as a system), this is a good buy if you are a lover of fae or the concept of smallfolk. In describing this to friends in terms of concept, it was described as sounding like ""Arthur and The Invisibles meets Fallout 4 and/or Conan Exiles,"" and I feel this is fairly apt. If you've wanted a fae game that isn't Tinkerbell, and enjoy survivals, I think this is a good match for you, but may also need more time to develop and grow.

I edited my review as I have a lot to say about the game and figured out a way to better format my review to share these things, I have been loving it as a lover of fae and being in love with the concept of being small and having to use items like leaves for outfits. So hopefully I can condense it.

[h3]Detailed Review[/h3]
[b]Building[/b] -The building in the game is pretty nice, games using similar building systems being Valheim and Conan Exiles. It works, and its quite fun. I have seen quite a fair amount of unique and cool bases.

[b]Combat[/b] - The combat feels fairly good, being similar to Conan Exile's kindof ""soulslike esc"" for lack of better describing, though sometimes is a struggle due to competing with the concept of a ""small person fighting things much larger than it"" and wanting more accurate hitboxes; most times this feels like a pretty good challenge though. I will say, I'd love shields.

Archery is a little difficult to me, it feels fairly good especially if you enjoyed Conan Exiles or Skyrim's archery and pretty similar to those (being honestly the best way to have archery imo), but I am better at archery in those games in first person than third, and first person in this game is not great, akin to the ""more accurate first person"" mods of games like Skyrim or Oblivion, where its less first person more your camera moved to replace your head. So you wobble, a lot. 
This does have the benefits of seeing yourself in first person is more accurate, and cuts down on development time and effort to make sure first person works, but I'd love to see a proper first person made at some point, or a way to customize how much your camera wobbles in this view to make it less motion sickness inducing.

[b]Difficulty[/b] - Fairly customizable, you have good control of what you'll deal with within the world, though I'd love to see more options such as customizing what enemies spawn, how frequent storms are, etc. I'd especially like to customize weather, including storm frequency but also how intense the seasons effect temperature, to put more emphasis on what gear I should have. Some way to tell what time you're at as well would be nice - even if its an item like a calendar for your base, or a clock with a season indicator so you know better when you're about to change seasons.
I do know theres plans for seasons to do more than just change temperature slightly and change the appearance of the world, I am excited for these changes as currently while winter can be a bit threatening, its easily countered by a level 3 set of padded gear and/or soup.

[b]Graphics[/b] - There is a bug relating to graphics where it'll ""flicker"" between low and high; I fixed it by updating my graphics drivers (I have a NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060, so nothing fancy) but this didn't work for a friend, I don't know what they have. Turning down VisualFX reduces the flickering a little bit to where its less distracting, but it also hampers how nice the game looks and doesn't fully help the problem. 
This appears to be an issue with FLSS as FLSS options are greyed out in game, and correlates with the update a bit since FLSS 3 was advertised on my driver update, but I'm not savvy of game development in that front so thats just a guess. The options are still greyed out despite the update, too.
Once you get past that bug (if you even have that bug), the game looks very pretty. Its not high infidelity graphics or ""next gen"", it gives me fairly good nostalgic-y vibes of older games in its graphics, while still sporting a bit of today's graphic enhancements.

[b]Content[/b] - Smalland suffers similar to other survivals do in that there isn't a lot to do aside from ""survive"", but it doesn't have a whole lot of goals for you in the pursuit of ""survive"" either. More content updates are dropped by the devs, so this is being worked on, but in its current state it may be easy to become bored. There is a storyline you can do, but the game does not emphasize it a whole lot and it can be hard to keep track of. Survival as is isn't too difficult, either, winter sounds like it should be feared but it doesn't change enough yet.

[h3]Personal Thoughts[/h3]
I have a lot of in depth thoughts I can give for each category, its hard singling out things I feel are most important to say. I enjoy the game, and all its small systems are incredibly cool. It's a mixture of almost everything I like, missing only the community aspect Modding brings and a transmog+gear dye system. I will 100% vouch I feel modding would be amazing for this game; but I want to say they've stated they're not sure they will add modding but if they do its not anytime soon. I'd also like to see gliding improved; its good as is, but it could be better, both for mounts and wings.

Give it a try if you like fae/smallfolk and the concept of trying to survive when you're very small and enjoy games such as Conan Exiles, Valheim, and/or Ark (according to a friend). I am excited to see where this game goes. Also good if you want Grounded, but don't particularly prefer the ""Honey I Shrunk a Kids"" and are thinking more along the lines of ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" style aesthetics.",1703872275,1704136446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Do hope though that they add some sort of fast travel system (maybe the trees?) or maybe a main spawn point and then a sleeping bag you can move around so you can choose where you spawn when you die. Travel definitely gets excessive when following the story.

below are a few observations that with good community feedback will most likely either get better or be removed.

It does well:
Environment - the look and feel of roaming the map is one of the strongest points of the game.
Creatures and NPC's - the enemies and other characters in the game look great and are fun to fight 
Multiplayer - with 3/4 players this game runs smooth and is very good fun

Needs Improvement:
Amber Valley - I know this is the final zone so is still under construction but the mob density is quite low and the area does not have much interesting stuff, makes farming materials in the area very dull.

Stat System - the stats system is a basic strength, dexterity, constitution, endurance and intelligence setup INT and DEX are currently not worth spending any points in at all they might change the game play but nit in any significant way where it matters, strength, health and stamina are so important the other stats might as well be removed.

Boss Combat - general combat is quite simple and leads it self to farming materials (complex mob combat is a headache if all you one is item to drop) but the bosses are far to easy to kill, most bosses and large enemies have 2 attacks which the spam in a fixed order and most of these attacks do little damage. some thought and time into making boss fights far more impact-full would improve this game ten fold.  

Sound - this was a difficult one to criticise since the ambient music is great and insects do sound pretty cool, but the fight music and the creature sounds keep playing after combat has finished and this can be pretty annoying, also the game uses audio queues to indicate when to block and some times this goes out of sync, making you miss a block or 2.

Does Badly:
Compendium - the compendium is a useless text dumps that does not contain any of the information the quest giver reveals during the game.

Item Repairing - if you play with friends and one is specialising into INT then you most likely will not be able to use anything they make once the pass 20 points in INT, this is a weird design decision and the antitheses of what a co-op game is. this should be removed asap.

Controller Support - only partial controller support, cannot really remap much and it completely skips any real way to use your hot bar (this makes taking pots or switching weapons during combat very difficult)

Overall I really enjoy playing this game and am looking forward to many more hours of game play when it leaves early access.

highly recommend buying.",1704125807,1704125807,True,26,0,0.737946629524230957,0,True,False,True

If you liked Grounded, and you really want to play a game just like it, this is passable. I wouldn’t say I didn’t enjoy it. But if you haven’t played that game yet, or didn’t love that game, there is no reason to play this. This is like the low budget 1980s Star Wars rip off movie. Very familiar, but unable to capture any of the same quality or magic as the thing it is emulating.

It’s possible that given a few more years of development it will add features and flesh things out. The developers might be able to fix the floaty controls and the terrible crafting interface. Develop a more interesting progression system and maybe one that takes more than a few hours to blast through. Make mounts more useful or more fun.

now if you are here for the long story, there is a pet/taming system but the list is like 10 and only 5 of them feel good to have. 
the graphics need help everything looks great on ultra and high but causes tearing and rubber-banding when playing multiplayer( seem to happen less to the host) lowering the graphic below that makes the game look like you are trying to play while wearing glasses that dont belong to you. hurts eyes and needs work.
the combat is fine nothing crazy but major complaint is HAVING FULL STAMINA and not being able to either swing weapon or dodge. No i wasnt trying to cancel an animation or something its just after taking an action like jumping or swinging to do combos your character will sometimes just not respond and do nothing for a few seconds which gets annoying with most fights. With that said most enemies share attack behaviors so ALL spiders attack the same, ALL lizards attack the same, ect. So once you know what it is fights become kinda trivial, although the bosses mix it up a bit in a good way.
beating the game/getting all trophies can be done in 24 hours of gameplay if not less not hard to do. after that you could be done with the game or you can just explore the world and unlock more little things to do or decor your home. most likely spend the most time in this game building a home that you like if you are not into that then you will not like half of what the game has to offer.

The game's design for weapons needs some work. I got a praying Mantis scythe, and the moveset is extremely over the top (like korean MMO anime style, where the character defies gravity to do mid-air back spin slashes.) Yes, it's cool, but it feels way out of place for this game, especially when the starter club is so basic in comparison.

There is a very basic stats system (dex increases speed, strength increases dmg, etc.) that seems to have no correlation to what gear you can use.

There is a lot of grinding, but it is very boring, I can’t say exactly what is connected with it, probably 1 animation for several tools and resources. You can collect resources for new armor for 30 minutes, but after the same 30 minutes, when you move to a new location, it will no longer be relevant, not because it is weak, but because there are resources for new armor everywhere.

When extracting scissors, they have an ax animation, is that normal?
There are only 2 types of enemies in the game, these are ground beetles and flying beetles. The attacks are the same, only the skin and level change/

The world, I would say, is not beautiful, there is nothing for the eye to grab onto, there are no landmarks. You have to live in the trees, since every millimeter on the ground is dotted with endless mob spawns

You will discover all the mechanics of the game literally in the first hour of the game and they will remain with you until the very end. Consider there is no plot in the game, because “Go talk to this woman, she will tell you which boss you need to kill”

I love this game. In my experience, it's extremely well balanced, runs well, has very few glitches, and handles multiplayer super well. For context, I played this regularly with a group of around 3 to 5 and as of 38 hours in, still haven't ""beaten"" the game despite my friend group being extremely experienced with this genre of game. 

Strongly recommend.
[hr][/hr]
[h1]Specifics/Details[/h1]
Context of my opinions: experienced in the genre, played mostly multiplayer with only some bouts of soloing as folks took breaks, etc. We really no-lifed this game.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
Feels smooth and responsive. Weapon varieties matter. Can utilize block or dodge techniques depending on weapon and preference. 

[h2]Exploration[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
Extremely rewarding. Filled with lots of little charming details. Critical to unlock some things in the game.

[h2]Enemies[/h2]
[b]4/5[/b]
Tons of variety. Telegraphed/memorable attack patterns to get skilled at, or have weaknesses you can exploit to avoid having to ultra sweat each fight. Biggest negative is the AI is sometimes a bit baffling and non-optimal (for itself, it's usually to your advantage).

[h2]Mounts/Pets[/h2]
[b]4/5[/b]
Good variety. Niche uses. Most mounts have very clear functions and purposes. Very fun and rewarding to tame and utilize. Well balanced. Avoids the ARK problem of having to babysit a creature for 48 hours. Biggest negative is some mounts feels dramatically outclassed and less useful ([spoiler]Geko and Damselfly[/spoiler] felt like the biggest examples in our playthrough). In multiplayer, if everyone has a pet out, it can get a bit chaotic but felt manageable with around 4 of us.

[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
I was the host. We had almost no issues with latency or player detection. Other players existed where and when you expected them to without any glitchiness. Lots of content felt appropriately fun in a big group without trivializing everything. 

[h2]Equipment[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
Lots of variety. Lots of different uses. Felt like you could take one armor set for a long time and still get a lot of out of it, or upgrade to the next tier and it felt impactful but did not trivialize the content.

[h2]Crafting[/h2]
[b]3/5[/b]
Fairly simple, but generally good. Lots of cool recipes. Biggest negatives are around missing features such as crafting multiples and things like that. Actual meat of the crafting content felt fine, just missing functions that most games have.

[h2]Building[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
Lots of forgiveness in structural integrity. Lots of very in depth and cool designs. Tons of customization. Lots of freedoms. Restrictions make sense and feel appropriate for the game. 

[h2]Overall[/h2]
[b]5/5[/b]
Great game. Tons of fun. Feels like a more serious Grounded, or as though Grounded and ARK had a child and this was said child. Definitely feels like we got our money's worth and excited to see what they make for this in the future.",1703583011,1703583059,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

While it is possible to solo-play, it's better with a friend or three+. Very kid friendly and even though gun and genocide is introduced late-game, I've found both can be avoided and are not hurdles to the main storyline, so it's nice to have both gameplay options available.

Survival: You only have to eat instead of eat/drink, starvation will kill you, falling can kill you, drowning is a real thing to avoid. Cold will kill you, storms will hurt you so you have to seek shelter. Some server settings can make the game easy/hard mode. I feel it's pretty well balanced. Eq repairs if done early cost nothing but can incur a heavy materials cost if horribly damaged. Right now there only seems to be cold, but I imagine overheating will also be a game mechanic down the road. Lots of food but not much diversity in effects. 50 types of food that only have 3 tiers, that will hopefully change to become more diverse. When 20 recipes all result in the same hunger regen, you just make the less costly one.


Building: Lack of building items is made up for in types. Grass, wood, stone, and metal building materials are available, items can be rotated along 3-axis, snap/unsnap setting and scaling makes for a very enjoyable building experience. Structures built in the Server world are bound to that server, but anything you build in your 'claimed tree' follows you to whatever server you play on, as soon as you claim a tree on the new server world. 

Fighting: basic swing, parry with weapon (no shield), dodgeroll. Standard 3 damage types: slash, pierce, blunt. Poison damage affects the player more than it does mobs. Standard healing/stamina/poison resist potions. 

Storyline: Very linear and weak on content. However, it's good for little kiddos. The storyline follows a direct arc that you can do at your own pace. Each new storyline NPC unlocks the next tier of gear and weapons, sometimes after a small quest like killing a boss or retrieving a key item.

Features: The wing glide/fly is very cool. The mounts are way fun. There are plenty of unique pets. You can get them all, and level them up, providing hundreds of hours of fun if collecting and having an ""Ultimate Collection"" is your jam.",1703232737,1703232737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have reversed my review for this game as the developers have proved that they listen to reason and have not bowed to corporate greed like another dinosaur game.

Smalland is a fun co-op game with some interesting progression and a housing mechanic that is unique.  Your home base can move from giant tree to giant tree throughout the map, which is a very interesting take on base building in a survival game.

The game is long from finished but is very playable in it's current state.  If you are looking for a game with the similar feel of Grounded, then give this a go.  Don't be fooled however, combat can be difficult and this game is much better when played together...on a private, home-hosted dedicated server.

Thanks again Devs!

[strike]Currently have 30+ hours in the game and while it is fun, we were waiting for the Dedicated server support to arrive.  Instead the devs have decided to lock server support to hosted server only through GPortal which is not what the community asked for.  I cannot recommend this game if this is what they do.

Perhaps if they reverse this decision, I will rethink this review.  Terrible decision and anti-community.[/strike]",1701811839,1703206012,True,0,0,0.688534736633300781,0,True,False,True

My friends and I have found a work around, though its not the most elegant solution IMO;
Whoever is hosting the world is the only person who can claim a tree and everyone be able to build in said tree and their stuff be there upon login. Never build in any public tree unless its your character's, or you will spawn alone at the start point of the game if the person who owned that tree is not online. I do not have a server through G-Portal so I'm unsure how this works on those. Am also unsure what happens on G-Portal hosted servers that have two people login that own the same tree (as if your character isn't logged into the world nothing they've built on their tree will exist). 
Claimed trees are linked to the character that claimed them ONLY, which has pros and cons. [b]Pros-[/b] your tree (if you have one) is your spawn and pet appear where ever you login, no matter which world you login to, even a friend's. [b]Cons-[/b] If you play multiplayer survivals with your friends and like to build bases together you are metaphorically down the river without a paddle if the owner of the tree isn't on and you login to no bed (cause it's in a friend's claimed tree)
[u]I still believe the tree thing should be fixed by either making it [i]group claimable, or something similar.[/i] [b]BUT[/b] I wanted to change my review upon finding a work around as the game is insanely fun to my entire group.[/u]


[quote=author] [i]As of right now,[/i] no, I do not recommend this to others.

[u]Reasoning-[/u] Saves are [b]incredibly poorly done[/b], just spent 6 hours playing because we WERE enjoying it. Then, we needed to get off. So i looked up how to save the game, apparently that can only be done by exiting the game. So I exited, and reloaded it just to check that it saved. It saved my character and their inventory but [i]not their bed spawn point like halfway across the map.[/i] 
It spawned me in [i]at the very beginning of the game on the balcony with two soldiers.[/i] Literally had to [b]attempt to run [i]on foot to our base, where my character's bed is,[/i] just to die 3 times trying to get there.[/b] Apparently [i]ONLY the person that's claimed a tree can spawn at that tree, [b]regardless of beds and set spawnpoints.[/b] [/i]
There needs to be a clan/tribe setting or something to fix this. Because spawning halfway across the map because your bed is in your partner's tree (in a base that YOU built) is ridiculous. 
[b]If this gets fixed[/b] it'll have a great recommendation from me. [/quote]",1702135529,1703080016,True,1,0,0.50484764575958252,0,True,False,True

Building mechanics are a bit clunky but not a deal breaker. My fav thing is the missions so I hope they keep up with those.

Dedicated servers come out on the 11th and I cant wait to get a big populated server going! If you like Ark SE, Valheim, Grounded then you will love this!

EDIT: The non dedicated servers update is horrible. No party system. No door locks/codes. Wether you set your tree encampment to private or public other players can claim your tree when you go offline! When playing the game if you want your friends to have access to your tree and base you have to set it to public...which also means everyone on the server can access and destroy your base wether friendly fire is on or not!

Yes, it is flagged as early access, but the current content is rather a snapshot instead of a well rounded, enjoyable experience. While my friend and I grinded some components at the start, around mid to late game it became completely obsolete to farm for anything else. We also skipped many sets of gear because they were not necessary to obtain. 

We also increased the difficulty to ""difficult"" with increased mob damage and HP. The game still was rather easy to play with no rewards for increased difficulty. We can also agree on the mounts being incredibly unbalanced with no adapted stats to their, in reality, unique traits. The damselfly was not a single bit faster than the Hornet while being much squishier and no abilities to attack. The grasshopper was literally the fastest and earliest mount to obtain in the game, maybe apart from the incredibly expensive blue tit mount at the very end of the game. Where's the reward in grinding for that if the game is basically over once you are able to obtain the blue tit?

Leveling the pets was also rather useless. In the area in the north, we immediately encountered a hornet lvl 98. So why make the effort and level the low level hornets from the southern area? Mobs usually ranged from level 4-16 there.

At its current state, the northern area is unfinished and doesn't connect well with the southern area. we also didn't find the missions to be in any way engaging. So in conclusion, the game is mediocre at best and compared to other ""small world"" games on steam, this one feels unpolished and repetitive quickly.",1702720141,1702720141,False,91,8,0.673330307006835938,0,True,False,True

Overall this is a stunning and charming survival / crafting game that conjures themes nostalgically from Fern Gully or the Borrowers. I appreciate the setting that allows for fauna to only aggro when attacked - which so-far has allowed for a peaceful exploration through the stunning scenery. The customization of the day/night and season cycle is a welcome addition as well. This certainly has all the components for a cozy gaming experience or a more brutal survival expedition throughout the untamed wilds of nature.

----------< Pros >----------

- Customisable servers with settings to your liking for you and your friends to play in.

- Great building system, with a bunch of craftables to learn.

- Beautiful atmospheric graphics and ambience.

- Very large and diverse map.

- HD with a very nice detailed approach on skins and textures.

- Various differentiating biomes with different monsters etc.

- NPCs in different biomes in case you have no friends to talk with! A+ feature.

- NPCs have quest lines and different unique rewards and upgrades up for grabs.

- Boss fights and danger zones for even more variation.

- Male and Female character customisation, with plenty of variety for looks.

- Detailed map and a compass at the top, for easy navigation between zones and areas.

- Easy to mark areas on the map and save them on your map with naming options.

- Can set bed's as your spawn point.

- Grave markers to recover items, with no despawn (can turn off loss of items upon death too!)

- Grave will always be sent to a location you can recover it from.

- Items in (a spacious) inventory stack without a weight capacity punishment.

- Tameable mounts and pets with their own unique abilities.

- Nice soundtrack.

- Many many more pros that I can't be bothered to type out, but there's some top ones.

----------< Cons >----------

- Early access so it is still updating and improving (not a fully polished game, yet).

- Cannot swim in water, and drowning might become your most common death.

- Can only tame one pet, to my knowledge.

- Probably more that I can't think of right now, so I dunno don't come at me nerds.

Would very highly recommend giving this a go it's 100% worth the money, even in early access. I would also recommend play it with a partner or group of close friends. The more the merrier. Maybe even get some clans or something going with different types of armour.

I like that while there is story progression, the equipment has trade offs leading to choices instead of grounded is sort of like ""you've progressed to this type of equipment and there's no reason not to use it as it makes everything before it obsolete"". It makes for better variety and replayability IMO. I've done almost 0 questing as that isn't what's important to me at all so I'll leave that for others to speak on, although from my limited experience, all dialogue is text and all NPCs are static. The creatures seem varied, and the combat is fairly fun if too easy. Map is big, looks nice, lots of cool views, although a lot of the ""giants"" (full size human) stuff that you find is pretty uneventful. I've spent some time climbing up some stuff only to find there was nothing there at all. Still, a really nice map, would be more interesting without tree bases.

What I don't like:
The tree bases. What a dumb idea (for it to be moveable). The map is really cool and has a solid amount of variety and nice views, but the spawns don't stop even if you build, so no matter where you make your base on the ground you'll be attacked daily by the spawns in the area. Manageable, but annoying. So basically, you use the tree base, its safe, its out of the way, and it has...an air balloon...? If the game is fairly fantastical, and the tree bases are a phone-in anyway, why not just a teleporter, the balloon is slower, and makes me wonder why can't I use it for my getting around the map for my important quests? Why make moveable bases and keep people from having to build bases with defences, and various outposts? Maybe it's a move for the casual types who prefer to fast travel, but I don't like it in a survival, it chips away at the necessity of the building which is one of my favourite parts of these types of games.

Solid game, worth a buy, but I hope they do something for people who want to build on the actual map, IE: make the spawns in an area stop once you've built a base of x size or something.  I don't mind the concept of the tree bases, its actually really cool up there and it isn't instanced which would be totally lame. I just hate that they move, it's cheesy. Sure you could just not do it, but you're gonna for convenience sake. Wish it was a setting you could turn off.",1701301980,1701301980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a lover of all things fantasy and fae, and also being a fan of base building survival games (namely the one's where you get pets!), Smalland is scratching a pretty niche itch that I've had for a very long time. 

A couple comments I have atm:

Character Creation. I love that we have the ability to customize our character's appearance! This is a huge aspect of my enjoyment with pretty much any game. The options are somewhat limited, but I feel that that's acceptable for the genre, and imo they are still better than other similar games I've played. I would love to see more options in the future as it would really enhance immersion to be able to personalize my character more. The body options are a substantial improvement from other games. I love being able to play characters with different body shapes from the standard thin/trim models that most games utilize. Also, the fact that we already have the ability to change our appearance in game is huge considering that it is usually a feature I see being thrown in as an afterthought even in games that have a much higher focus on character creation.

Combat. The difficulty of enemies is pretty rough in the beginning, which was pretty frustrating as there is no fast travel and getting around is pretty difficult until you are able to get some wings. However, this only enhances the feeling of satisfaction I get at reaching higher levels and crafting tiers. The fact that I spent a lot of time painstakingly avoiding bees and beetles in the early game just makes it all the sweeter as I now one-shot most bees with my stinger spear after catapulting from my tree base and gliding to my destination with my iridescent hornet wings. The combat animations are also pretty nice. I like playing a melee focused character because the movements in combat are actually enjoyable.

Pets. I was very excited to find out that we could tame creatures in Smalland. I skipped all of the other tames and went straight to taming hornets as soon as I was able to. The pets definitely need work, though. I love them, but they are pretty much just expensive base decorations at this point. They are very squishy. My first hornet got killed by flies before I even realized it wasn't right behind me. I ended up switching to peaceful mode so that I could enjoy riding around on the spicy fly that I had worked so hard to get as a mount. I will probably end up switching back and leaving it at my base again at some point, though. I do like that there are special color variants of pets that you can find hidden around the map. I haven't found any for the hornets, although I did see someone saying they tamed the black hornet, I tried that and it didn't work for me.

All in all, I am thoroughly enjoying this game and I can't wait to see where they go with it.",1701212381,1701212381,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Summary:
You are a small fairy folk who's been sent above ground into the wilds to scout out the area, save some people, and other reasons. Once on the surface, you explore through multiple biomes while building up a base and progressing through different tiers of equipment as you explore.

You can either upgrade your equipment as you progress, or you can craft higher tiered armor - which is nice, as it gives multiple options for progression.

The game does have a leveling system, and with each level - you can put allocate points into some of the attributes to either become stronger, faster, have more health, or more stamina, or increase your chances of crafting better equipment.

The enemies are varied, and the combat if pretty fluid. The survival mechanics are pretty nice - where you have to keep yourself warm, fed, and alive.

Overall, it's a pretty fun game and I'd recommend it.

Fun adventure/survival game similar to Grounded, but more fantasy instead of sci-fi. You're a sort of Borrower-esque forest elf with slight bug features, whose civilization lives underground. As a explorer/warrior in your culture, your job is to explore the surface world after humans have disappeared and find a cure for your queen's illness. Because of your size, everything from an ant to an eagle is a threat, so you must take up arms and cut your way through the wilderness on the surface.

+ Melee and ranged combat, harvesting resources with different tools, and building bases to house all your klepto goods are the main ways you interact with the game. Feels great to get your shit pushed in by a bull ant, only to get better at fighting and parrying them, and then finally being stronger with more advanced gear and nearly one-shotting them as you go about your day. 
+ Day and night cycle actually serves some purpose too, with different mobs spawning at night. Haven't noticed them giving different drops, just seems more hostile outside at night time. And the changing of the seasons in-game is real cool too, seeing an area you're familiar with looking totally different covered in a blanket of snow.

From the moment I entered this pint-sized paradise, I was immediately captivated by the rich, immersive environment that teems with vibrant life and unexpected adventures.

One of the standout features of Smalland is its stunning graphics. Every blade of grass, fluttering butterfly, and towering tree is beautifully rendered, creating an atmosphere that feels alive and brimming with possibilities. The attention to detail is truly remarkable, making it easy to lose oneself in this enchanting miniature universe.

But it isn't just the visuals that make Smalland an exceptional game. The gameplay mechanics are incredibly unique and innovative, allowing players to experience the world from a new and refreshing perspective. As a tiny being, I found myself constantly amazed at the challenges and obstacles I had to overcome—whether it was crafting tools to build a shelter or finding creative ways to outwit the critters that roamed this tiny realm.

What further sets Smalland apart is its seamless integration of survival and exploration elements. With limited resources and constant danger lurking around every corner, the game never fails to keep players on their toes while embarking on thrilling quests and uncovering the hidden secrets of this whimsical world. The sense of accomplishment one feels when successfully completing a daring mission is truly exhilarating.

Moreover, Smalland offers a remarkable multiplayer experience. Coordinating and working together with friends to overcome obstacles and achieve shared goals adds an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie to the gameplay. There is nothing quite like collaborating with fellow tiny adventurers to build a thriving community in this wondrous realm.

Finally, the sound design and soundtrack of Smalland deserve special mention. The melodic tunes perfectly match the game's atmosphere, evoking a sense of childlike wonder and exploration. The subtle ambient sounds, whether it's the chirping of birds or the rustling of leaves, further enhance the immersive experience and make it feel like you are truly part of this miniature world.

In conclusion, Smalland is an exceptional game that combines stunning visuals, innovative gameplay mechanics, and a captivating world to create an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you are a seasoned gamer or new to the gaming world, this masterpiece offers something for everyone.

TL;DR of my Review: Buy game, it good.

Smalland is a diamond in the rough, at least that's my personal opinion. Following up on that, the main reason I say that is because I've played a few games of the same type, each one always giving me some form of disappointment because their design choices just... don't leave me feeling satisfied in one way or another. I refuse to play Ark not out of personal dislike, but because the sheer size of the damn thing just doesn't justify itself to me.

I played 7 Days to Die, and... yeah. Less said, the better.

I played Valheim, and it's... it does certainly scratch that norse itch for sure, but the sheer micromanaging that goes into it can leave me more frustrated than it would leave me with enjoyment. 

But Smalland? It does something for me that I haven't really experienced in any of those. The joy of exploration. Adventure. I'll ask you, if you're a current player to listen to Lord of the Rings music, like The Shire, and I promise it'll bring a whole new feeling to it. Nothing against the game's music of course.

You feel like you're taking on a grand adventure, one that you can tackle in any way that you'd like, go wherever you want to go, fight whatever creature wants to make you its next meal, all because YOU decided to go there. Again, I can't recommend this game enough.",1700946282,1700946282,True,2,0,0.518087506294250488,0,True,False,True

The pros:

- A theme that stands out, the world around you is mostly ordinary but it presents a good survival situation from your playable characters being very tiny. The world is vast with different biomes and an immersive atmosphere.

- Easy to get into and understand, lots to learn as you play more. You got your health, stamina and hunger bars to manage as in many survival games and the rest is up to you to discover.

- The freedom, as soon as you're out of the starting tutorial area you can do as you please and go mostly wherever you want. There are quests but the game doesn't hold your hand or force you to a specific route, the world is yours to explore as you want.

- The combat is very satisfying, and I was pleasantly surprised by how developed it is. You can dodge, block, parry at the right moment to stun your enemies and there are different types of damage and weapons too. It adds a lot of variety to how you want to approach every combat situation.

- You can customize your game exactly how you want, make it harder or easier, change the length of the season cycle as well as set the aggression of the creatures around you. There is something for everyone, be it a casual experience or a challenging word to survive in.

- The building aspect, if you like making a good looking camp/base the game offers you a variety of different materials and decorations to choose from, but if not you can still keep it basic and its perfectly viable.

The cons:

- The bosses and minibosses, I was hesitant to approach them on my first playthrough, but when I actually got around to fighting them I was disappointed. Most of them have one or two different attacks which isn't what I expected given how strong the combat with ordinary enemies started out. There are also creatures that I thought would just one shot you or you would need a special item to be able to beat them but that is not the case, you can just go in and defeat them if you have the health and potions to spare and you know how to block.

- Mount imbalance, there are several creatures you can tame to ride and they help with travel and/or combat. But in the early to mid game I see no reason not to use the grasshopper over the others just because it has so much mobility and allows you to traverse the map very easily. It is a shame because it lessens the otherwise solid variety the game offers you.

- A lack of greater reward for greater challenge: The amount of resources you obtain from fighting is the exact same on the easiest and hardest difficulties. It would be great if there were more drops or perhaps even unique drops to incentivize players who have conquered the wilderness already and want something more to go with a greater challenge.

Conclusion:

Given the price and what you get for it I definitely recommend the game. I give it a solid 8/10, it has a lot of good and a few bad things about it but overall its worthwhile if you're looking for a new survival game. As of writing this review the game is still in early access so a lot can change with time.

Eds: After a bit more time. I stand by my thumbs down, for now. The more I scrutinize it the more I believe that, especially in the climate of Steam's refund policy, it is not currently where I can advise it. I believe a lot of people will just opt out after the initial frustrations (as below). I support the vision, the aesthetic, the potential. And those, like me, who finds the concept and setting beautiful will just support it on principle.


Not a big hold your hand type. But it feels like the game just throws you into the wild without any means to heal up. Maybe I missed the recipe giver. You cannot touch water till you can, and then it will straight up murder you. The owl which gives you this critical information is poorly placed. 

It is generally too a rough start. I love the character creator and aesthetic as is. I feel however that teal is not an accurate description on the antenna colour we get. More colours in this specific aspect would be much appreciated. The other aspects I find great. Only in body types would a few more options help this aspect blossom.

Storms and night comes quick, even having set the default day time at +50%. All this puts me at the stance that the game start should be rethought a little bit. I am also sure the predominant positive reviews are all after a hard humbling. As I am sure the game picks up great momentum. [i]Upon further thought in this line, it is just how the cookie crumbles. Just bad luck to me. Even if the start is in another instance the server would still progress[/i]

Combat also feels heavily punctuated. Like playing Primal Rage (1994) or Street Fighter 2 on emulator nowadays. One can get use to the pace rather quickly. But with so many other games in this genre it feels like Smalland is sabotaging it's own potential. I am sure I will learn to love it, but I am sure the devs would do better trading on game play experience rather than just niche aesthetics 

I greatly appreciate that one can customise controls. I have found quite a few games recently which have built in conflicts which makes this a shallow feature rife with frustration. The only improvement in this section I want to see is that the quickbar reflect the key allocation rather than just the default number. As example for clarity, my building hammer is currently assigned to slot 4, which I assigned to the 'E' key. Easy enough to remember, but if things get hectic, or I take an lengthy break from the game.

I love the freedom of movement with the wings and grapple hook, and the armor designs are awesome too. The character models look a little dated and the character creator needs major improvements, but these are pretty minor complaints. The biggest issue I have with the game, is that once you build a structure, you can't move it. You have to destroy the structure and rebuild it. This makes updating your base 10x more annoying than it needs to be. Especially if you're mid to late game and have a storage room with filled chests of materials. I have no doubt that the developers will fix this. Another thing the developers should include in the game is voice chat. Having to stop everything I'm doing to type is pretty annoying. Though if you're playing with friends on Discord then you won't have to worry about that. Overall I would rate this game in it's current early access condition a solid 6/10 if you're playing solo, and a 7/10 if you're with friends.

I bought this game in June with a friend while it was on sale, he didn't have many hopes for the start of the game from what we'd seen on the trailers and attached game play footage, but the second we stepped foot into this game it was a whole new experience. 

The graphics and visual detailing has to be among one of the most beautiful things I've seen. It is incredibly intricate, the seasons change and it's almost like a completely different map, (and difficulty.) The way that the sunlight shines through the trees, the rivers that run through the maps, the flowers, the bees. It's breathtaking and one of the many reasons for me sticking to this game and being so immersed in it. The lighting is gorgeous and the building mechanic is super detailed, there are some incredible builders in this community that really take part in creating art within art and flourishing with it. The map has many different biomes, like the Oak Forest, (which has different areas of it's own,) The Greylands, The Swamp, The Ruins, The Forbidden Monuments and more, (while also continuously expanding - like the Amber Valleys update.) There are overgrown human structures and submerged human skeletons that make you want to deep dive the lore. It's all packed within the small game of Smalland. I can't rave about the detail enough, the colours are rich and inviting. It's beautiful. 

From when you load up the game, to the different parts within it, the soundtrack is charming and matches the game so well. It fits the theme to a T and is something to enjoy as soon as you enter the menu screen to when you're having to seek shelter from a storm, fighting bosses or hard enemies, or just exploring and doing your own thing. Another big reason why I loved this game from the beginning.

The game is story driven and lore filled. You're driven underground as small folk by humans who then later died due to an unknown circumstance and you start within the Burrows of the underground. Your first interaction with an NPC, who's known as The Elder, who sends you on a quest of finding a key to a chest that contains an elixir. There are few NPC's along the way that provide information, quests to kill bosses and good looking armour that help drive you to the end of the quest line. I did get lost a bit along the way, but it was a fun journey nonetheless. While the game is still in Early Access, there is much more to come in terms of story and I can't wait for it. 

Farming can be agonising, the game, (maybe before the release of enhanced skills,) is a bit difficult and you will die time and time again, whether it be drowning or being killed by grasshoppers, beetles or giant lizards, but you will grow to love this game from start to finish and I'm looking forward to the future content and full release of this game when it comes.",1700780938,1700781125,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The depth and brilliance in building and crafting are truly captivating, enabling an unparalleled level of creativity in constructing your base and crafting various items. The narrative progression seamlessly unfolds, granting access to superior armor and crafting options at the perfect pace. The graphics are breathtakingly beautiful, delivering a visually stunning and seamlessly smooth gaming experience.

My personal highlight is the ability to craft wings for gliding and swift travel, adding an extra layer of excitement and convenience to exploration. The sheer enjoyment derived from taming animals to aid in combat and serve as mounts is exceptionally delightful.

The map is extraordinarily beautiful und quite large. I´ve been playing alone so far and it can be pretty challenging, but the option to adjust the health and strenght of hostile insects, that was added lately, can help with that. There is also a peaceful mode which can be really useful to retrieve your death loot...
I recommend playing the game without looking up any guides or videos. Everything is explained well ingame, and ressources are pretty much where you´d expect them irl too. One thing to note is, you currently can only have one companion, so that´s why taming another one isn´t working.

The building system is very interesting too, since you can overlap and rotate parts vertically and horizontally and create a lot of different shapes and the building parts and decorations are beautiful. Currently there are 3 tiers of building sets, the 1st one very cheap, so it´s quick and easy to setup a starter base. There is already a large variety of armor sets and weapons to craft, the best ones of them pretty pricy and a bit of a grind to get though. The character creation at this point doesn´t offer too many options, but the characters look nice and cute and the animations are pretty good.

A really handy mechanic to point out is, you can move your base (once it´s a tree encampment) to any other Great Tree on the map, even to a different game hosted by a friend i.e., or lateron, once they added server support, to a different server. So I have been moving around my base all the time to where ever I´m currently harvesting or doing a quest etc...

One thing missing, which I hope will be added in the future is steam workshop support.
EDIT: Developers stated they do want to add mod-ability on steam, but not before release.

- Make it much quicker to get to the top of a tree base, I dont want to wait around for the balloon or climbing up to the gnome.

 They say they're coming up to 1.0 release, but this game feels so DRY. No real depth to it. The leveling up system is trash. The could have made classes, or a skill tree... NOPE just put a point into STR, DEX, INT, ect... 

Mounts, trash. They just aren't needed since we can glide very far.

 The building is mostly for vanity purposes. Work benches don't need a roof, nothing takes damage if it's not housed. You can literally just make a 1x1 for when storms hit you can stand in it, BOOM housing complete.

Repairing gear is free unless your item drops below 50% durability. So you have to plop down a basic crafting table at any time, anywhere, and repair FREE ALWAYS ON THE FLY... Just NO thought in sooo many aspects of this game.

I just got this game the other day. I haven't played much because i wanted to play on my steam deck. i will update this with more play time. I am about 1 hour in and i have only made it to the elder.

how i got it to run on steam deck
1. launch in desk top mode and it might even take 45 minutes to launch or more.
2. Be patient.
3. Connect a keyboard and mouse to name character and world!
4. Lower settings to medium and adjust.
5. At this point you should be able to launch in the normal game mode without proton or settings alterations.

Note: i am running on the most basic steam deck and made my 1 TB San disc micro my main storage. I'm not sure if that affects anything.

Grounded set the bar way to high for the particular niche of a game, and this game can barely lift that bar. To be fair, there is a little bit of originality peaking out here and there, but it is drowned out with 'Grounded did this and this, AND this better'. With that being said, the only thing worthwhile for now, is exploring a new place, it does feel newish, and has a tiny bit of potential. However, I can't recommend it quite yet, unless they change some of the fundamentals to where it fully shines in it's own identity instead of riding on Grounded's magnificent coattails. Even if this game were released back in 2011, with all of it's current ""tech"", it would still be mediocre at best beaten sorely by Skyrim and other games. It's just not fun.

Update: 8 or so months later, more content and quality of life fixes, visuals, bug fixes, and the game is playable with a decent amount of fun.

It's like if Grounded actually let the players have fun instead of putting them on a slow and janky theme-park ride.
Smalland isn't afraid to let you have fun with the combat and exploration, the NPCs all have character and are unique and memorable, the progression and pacing is made really well and the game actually keeps older tier materials relevant in a really innovative and immersive way, meaning when you advance you won't have to simply toss or forget everything you just spent ages to collect, you will likely need most of that later too.
This also adds to the whole world-scale, you'll be revisiting areas you've already been through so you get a better sense of immersion compared to feeling like you're on a speeding train only being allowed to look at all the amazing nature in passing.

The pet & mount system is awesome, loved it all the way through but it does have room for improvement before release.
They need to add a command-wheel for your pet, making them either aggro everything on sight, be passive and stick close or to cower away as not to get mangled by a bigger badder bug by accident.
Right now the whistle that summons your pet will simply not help you keep your precious pet alive since it will completely ignore it if it's actively in combat and not completely off-screen.
The only way to ""command"" your pet is to interact with it with the same interact key as everything else and using a clunky interact menu that will close if the pet so much as takes one step during you trying to scroll over to the right option, making it very hard to manage it when it's scurrying around in combat or flying around somewhere when you're just trying to get on it and want it to land. All this could be easily solved with some simple pet commands in any form really, whether a command wheel or otherwise.

The only real downfall of this game is the netcode.
Everything is serverside down to stamina regen and inventory management, which means if you're playing with someone out in the boonies or just happens to be shafted by a bad connection in the capital city of the world's most technologically advanced country, you're going to have a [strike]bad[/strike] [i]relatively worse[/i] time.

Just higher ping is going to make your experience worse, although depending on the host's connection, it might not be completely unplayable due to ping alone. Just say goodbye to trying to parry or dodge enemies and resolve to simply facetanking everything with enough healing items.

From rubberbanding to enemies hitting you from two miles away and it being impossible to dodge or block/parry attacks to being unable to even swap your weapons, I have no idea why they didn't just make most of this clientside and simply send the updates to the server like any game with a proper good netcode.

4/5 would highly recommend for any fans of survival sandbox games that won't mind a few [strike]bugs[/strike] creepy crawlies and have a decent ping and a stable connection if they're trying to play multiplayer. Cross-region is perfectly fine but will give a somewhat worse experience than playing with fellow countrymen, from EU to NA or otherwise it's been mostly fine even in public servers.",1699592398,1699592788,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Things I would love to see added to the game-


More flying creatures that attack you while you are gliding\flying. I really like how the new update did add air cannons in the new zone, so you have to be careful where and how you glide\fly!

I would love to see more armor sets added to the game. I think some more early game armor sets would be very beneficial, like a lady bug armor set. Then some other sets like, regular chitin armor or heavy chitin armor, or spiked armor that incorporates stingers from the hornets.

I would like to see the meals overhauled, each meal should have different stats depending how hard they are to make and the amount of resources they take to make, it seems like currently they are all too similar, I would love to see the meals have some debuffs for eating certain things or uncooked things, like uncooked mushrooms or bug lymphs!

I would also like to see, a way to track current quests and have it appear on screen, yes it does add the person or creature you need to go see or fight on your map, but I would very much like to see it in text on part of your screen, and the ability to pick what part of your screen it shows on!

It reminds me of a video game version of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" but without any humans. You enter the game already the size of an ant.

The map is huge and very well designed. You can gather and build like in all good survival games. In this one one you can also unlock schematics and recipes, and even the ability to tame wild creatures (lady bugs, grasshoppers, lizards, dragonflies, hornets, etc). Once tamed, they can help you fight and serve as a mount. The flying insects allow you to fly, which helps for quicker travel across the large map. 

I have about 40 hours and I've nearly finished the main storyline. I just unlocked the forbidden monument to the far North. I'm level 65, but even at high levels you still have to be careful not to take on too much at once. You craft your armors and weapons and tools, so almost none of the practical items in the game are acquired without crafting. The progression here is nice, but all monsters will respawn quickly, which detracts slightly from the immersion. There are also weather events, daytime/nighttime hours with different monsters for night versus day, and even seasons (summer/winter).

Very nice and atmospheric with lots of great potential for future growth of game too.
Can't really complain much, maybe only about obvious lack of decorative items and really rapid season change (that does nothing for gameplay except winter is cold) ...looks really stunning thou (especially fall).
Would be handy to have a health bar for your friends gaming with you as for now you don't know that they died until you realise they back home and you have to kill that roach yourself XD
Multiplayer works no problem and we spend 32h almost in the row on it now with my boyfriend...
The things that bother you are really just cosmetic things like that lack of decorative items (especially when you think of POTENTIAL ...I could sketch some concept pieces without even thinking much of it xD)

I really love that you can chose your body type - and one of the females bodies is tall... I'm tall myself and it drives me mad when game by default makes me shorter than male characters...
Outfits are cool, same for both genders... the UNDERWEAR is great.

So yeah if you are a female player and you tired of skimpy dressed pseudo-cool npcs that one is for you too - really great vibe npc ladies have.

So yes, I recommend you give it a go and look at world from slightly different perspective than we all are used to. (laugh, but standing below a bench and looking at discarded camera laying on it from a bug size perspective have something magical about it...)

--To the ones that are interested in buying the game--
----------------------------------------------------------

I bought the game, played it until the endgame and done some researches so you can find all the overall experience below. 

And it is a really a shame what the devs are doing to this game now. 


-*The good stuff:*-
You can adapt the difficulty to your liking

I wanted to give more good stuff and i will not because each time i will have to say for each point :
point 1 *before the last update ruined it* 
point 2 *before the last update ruined it* 
point 3 *before the last update ruined it* 



-*The Research and good to know stuff :*-
-Yes you can host.
-Yes the host can decide to pvp or not it is also *coming soon on bigger servers*.
-No you dont need the epic game launcher or to create an EPIC account at all it is like an EPIC process running and again NOT the launcher because of Unreal Engine.
-No i didnt test the multiplayer atm because i gave up like the dev gave up on this game.



-*The bad stuff :*-
You can feel that there is A BIG DIFFERENCE of letting down between the early stages of this game and its *last update* made in october with scorpions and so far* AKA endgame.

Like the devs went from giving passion to this game to being dry of ideas and forgetting some level design details that made the early stages of the game very enjoyable and are now taking every UNNECESSARY step to ruin this game.

You get the feeling of being scammed at the endgame.

--------------------
---To the devs :---
--------------------

It is an early access so
Bugs are ok.
Cant feel any change All armors feel the same but ok for an early access.
And many other unnecessary things like putting some farm exclusive zones. and again okish.


I really was enjoying the game so far before the last update of october.


It wasnt necessary to make the game stupidly difficult just to make it difficult and gives us a BS challenges until your next update.

The overall game progression before the update was very good.

Both of enemies difficulty and grinding difficulty was very good.

Knowing that BEFORE this last update : 

-I never changed the difficulty ONCE.

-I never felt bored ONCE.

-I never felt a BS challenge and P***ED ONCE.


*******TAKE YOUR TIME FOR YOUR NEXT UPDATE DONT RUIN YOUR GOOD JOB FOR GIVING US A GOOD GAME EXPERIENCE SO FAR THAT IS NOW ALL RUINED******

ON THE LAST UPDATE:

IT WENT FROM => 

IMPRESSIVE GAME
NICE IDEAS 
NICE LEVEL DESIGN
NICE GRAPHICS 
NICE FARMING
NICE PROGRESSION 

TO =>
F**** THIS I AM OUT. 


It wasnt necessary, but just to make the game longer and gives us some unecessary and BS challenge to do until the next update wasnt the right decision and had the negativ effect of letting down this game.


And NO I WILL NOT GO FOR A LESSER DIFFICULTY.

Because I DONT WANT SOME ENNEMIES TO BECOME MORE EASY JUST 

BECAUSE I CHANGED TO A LESSER DIFFICULTY TO BEAT A BS ENNEMY.

NO THANKS.

IT LITERALLY WENT FROM MODERATE TO A DARKSOUL DIFFICULTY. 

I really enjoyed this game so far as others did.


Now i finished the game.


I mean i do not feel like playing it anymore, because some real hardcore level balance and gamelevel design needs to be done for both of enemies vs weapons and armors defenses and grinding cessions on your last desert map aka last october update.


You guys got good ideas but on this update you also made some very hasty and bad endgame decisions.


As others i really wish to change this review.

It's nice that you can tame the animals. But here is the first weak point. You can only have one animal at a time, unfortunately not several at the same time. And breeding I would also find a good thing. The story is also comprehensible to a certain extent. But until shortly before the update, you stand there, have the blue tit and do not know how it continues. The blue tit is my biggest point of criticism. It's much too difficult to control, especially landing requires a great deal of skill and pre-calculation because you can't control the speed. Unfortunately, you can not fight with him when you ride him but must dismount so that he fights back. You have to see that the opponents don't kill you right away. In addition, he is constantly stuck in some structures and you have to fidget around until you have freed him again. Regarding all animals but especially the blue tit, I wonder why the animals always respawn at the bed when entering the game or respawning after death. If the respawn point is in a house you have especially with the blue tit the problem to get them out again because much too big for a house. My second big criticism is the high grind factor. 2000 pyrite to get a blue tit is pretty sick. Since you quickly lose the desire.The next big point of criticism is in Coop Mode. It's a pity that you can only use structures built by another player if he is also in the game. Otherwise they are simply not there. This is very annoying if you have your spawn point with a fellow player and want to play alone, you spawn somewhere and can not get stuff and also means that you have to build everything several times so that you can continue playing alone or without one of the other players properly. Overall, the game is a lot of fun, especially if you play with two or more players. I'm also excited about all the new things from the update. It has a lot of potential if it stays in Early Access for a while longer. If it goes into release like this then I think it loses a lot of that potential and will quickly diminish the gameplay. I hope that when it is released it will still be worked on a lot. I would definitely stay in EA and continue to work on it and exploit the full potential.",1697745890,1697745890,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The armours are beautiful and the gliding wings are so awesome. Even more so now that they have been separated and can be used on a variety of outfits (winter gear especially). 

The game is still lacking in some areas, The main story is not the most exciting part, I do enjoy it as part of the game but by itself I would literally not bother to much. The combat could be spruced up just a little to give each weapon a bit of flare and to really catch their unique design and use for specific weaknesses on insects. The tools as well could maybe get looked at again, example with the shears, I don't think the shears need to be swung like an axe, maybe a kneel down and cutting animation would suit better. Then with the axe, I'd love to see the animation for cutting down materials maybe make use of a two handed swing instead. 

That's about all I have concern about, bugs are always going to be present in any start up so I'll comment on them in the bug report page. I love this game a lot and hope it continues to grow.

on the visuals: it is quite beautiful, and the world comes to life at night. the game is quite stunning the whole way through to current content.

on the lore: surprisingly deep. still figuring things out, myself.

Solo player experience here!
Combat feels pretty nice though blocking seems rather useless since you still take a lot of damage when blocking and I'm not sure if I can parry by timing it perfectly.

Travelling feels annoying and exhausting, creatures seem to be always chasing you no matter where you go. Getting a second to breathe is almost impossible unless you stay in the starting area or kill every creature you encounter, this eats resources like crazy that I meant to use at my destination!

Combat as alright as it is feels very forced on the player with crouching for stealth being so slow that you won't get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. The aggro range of creatures also seems a bit high especially for wasps.


Considering it's already launching into 1.0 I cannot recommend it with how lacking this game is.
QoL issues I have:
Inventory sorting is completely absent and the game doesn't automatically stack items when you gather them from your gravestone and already had some of that item in your inventory.
Crafting stations do not check nearby containers for ingredients which makes crafting a bit awkward.
Why can we not move placed workstations and chests? I don't feel like breaking my stuff just to move it by 1 foundation man.
I'm not sure why ""Store all"" would close the chest I was looking at, I was depositing loot and wanted to take a full stack out and not close the chest.
When crafting there could and imo should be a craft x10 and craft all button. I don't enjoy clicking 37 times to make 37 seed oil...

A different Issue I have as a solo player is that Bows do not seem viable beyond firing 1 arrow before switching to melee as bows slow you down to a crawl.

Exploration feels slightly discouraged by amount and power of the creatures that you encounter. Especially early on. (Namely wasps, ants swarming you and geckos.)

I will keep updating this review as I play more and the game gets updated.",1684061319,1696154662,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It quickly moved to the top of my favourite games.

It's fun running around hearing all the little insects, bugs, etc making their own random noises from little ladybugs who freak out when bull ants are nearby to bouncy-bum spiders to bees and wasps.

You will probably die a lot at the start, but don't let that get to you. Read a guide or two or watch YT vids to get a headstart on what to do.

I now have a little shack at the top of a Great Tree and am planning a bigger place to live. The lift butler is really cool and I love going up and down the tree.

It's not long before you are one-shotting big ants and other bugs. So satisfying seeing them go down. I can kill one bee at a time with about 3 hits and it sounds like they are either farting or their engine conked out when they hit the ground! haha!

I'm currently cutting down poppy, rye and strawberry plants to get materials to build my new home.  

I really enjoy taming a grasshopper and bounding around the map looking for stuff to do. So much more interesting than plain running. Unfortunately, I need to be more careful with my grasshopper Ubers cos they've both died, but I have plenty of taming food ready and can easily make more.

The graphics are top-notch. In fact, I'd say they are the best graphics I've seen in ANY game -- and I've been gaming since 8bit computers with 4 colours and 128x64 pixels! Yes.. that far back!

The environment is so gorgeous to walk around in. Sometimes it doesn't even matter if I don't really have any goal in mind.  I can just wander around looking, listening and experiencing the wonder of it all. And then just grab some much-needed supplies.

There's so much to discover and it's all unique! I've only been playing for a couple of days, but this game is just so much fun I know I'm gonna be playing it forever!

I haven't had any friends download to play on their maps yet, but I've been telling everyone to get it!

It runs very smooth (for me at least), the content updates have been great adding new structures, armors, tools, weapons and zones to explore.  There have been several patches in between the larger content updates that all are welcome improvements and fixes.  The game looks very good visually and the small folk theme is great.  I had one gripe which was that the flying mount didn't really let you fly because it drained more stamina to go up then you could recover coming back down.  The flying tame felt more like a jumping tame.  This stamina disparity has since been fixed and additional flying tames have been added so my expectation of being able to fly around the map unhindered was realized and that was a while back.  My favorite part of the game other than being able to fly around the map with impunity  is being able to build cool bases and keep them.  Your base saves to your character if it is built in one of the great trees and you can bring it into other worlds if you bring your character there by claiming a tree in that world.  There are several great trees spread across the map so you and your friends can all have your own bases if you want.

[h1]Smalland: Survive the Wilds | By Wholf[/h1]
[list]
[*]Smalland is a game that you can compare with Valheim, ARK and Grounded. Valheim due to the biomes, character customization when it comes to better armor and such, ARK due to the taming and riding on animals/insects and everything and Grounded due to the whole environment and playstyle with insects and everything. You are a small insect, not quite sure what type you are but you are a insect where everything around you is bigger. If that makes sense. I have been playing this game together with my girlfriend and we have loved every second of it. I love these type of games! But when it comes to you playing this game solo... I kinda have the feeling it would become very boring in like 1/2 hours of playing this game.

[*] In this game there are different biomes and with different biomes I also mean different type of loot, you can tame insects and fly them or even use them to attack other insects, there are quests and has a lore in general which makes it more enjoyable in general, plenty of things to do, to discover and explore but also quite a wide building selection when it comes to you making your base and expanding/upgrading it. When pressing V if I'm correct you get a 'visual', some type of wallhack I can say to see where all the objects you can pickup/loot in a certain radius which makes the game a bit easier for yourself. Great feature if you are in very dark places with scary spiders for example.

[*] When it comes to combat, there is a certain negative feeling to it when you are a beginner in this game. The damage is pretty high and I highly suggest staying safe, build your base, loot as much as you can because you can die pretty easily early on in the game. When you have the loot, make a sword since a sword in the beginning is a must have. Certain insects can smell you, see you from far and do quite a bit of damage to you from x-meters away so always keep your eyes open. You can block attacks but you will have less stamina and take a little bit of damage but in general, it's based on what your play-style is since you can also be an archer or something like that you know. You'll understand if you play/played this game.

[*] Overall, I have been enjoying this game a lot together with my girlfriend. We had quite some laughs, there is a lot to do in my opinion and if I'm not mistaken, the developers are very active regarding development and updates so that's a must have as always, the feeling is great, the mechanics are there, the quality/graphics in general is also quite stunning and if I can rate this a 1 our of 10 I would give this a solid 7.5+. The price is right, sounds/effects are good enough and the only thing I really want to see is a bigger map expansion, more craftable items, more building materials, more insects and bosses, more easter eggs and hidden places or even hidden quests and I think that's about it. When it comes to total play-time of being done with the game, I think it's around 30+/- hours. You have explored everything, you know everything and there isn't much else to do after that besides stacking up your chests and expanding your base.

Negative - Poor graphics and gameplay optimization. Low quality character models.

Game-""Grounded Killer"".. Well, well, if so, then it will happen when Grounded has completely exhausted itself! And even then, it will take several more years after that.
Problems and complaints began with amazing optimization. My PC is not new, but modern games run easily at high settings and provide a stable 60 fps. Even projects on UE5, with all its bells and whistles, work fine. Here the rare 60 frames smoothly flow into 20-30 and back, and the strict linking of the camera to the character makes the picture jerky. It’s not even clear where the computer’s resources go. I admit, the lighting is good, but the character models, environmental objects and their animations take me back 10-15 years. The gameplay is made for a third-person game, but the character model that they are supposed to create is simply terrible, and the options for choosing appearance details are worse than each other. The same Grounded is designed primarily for first-person play, but even so the models and textures are much better!
However, even to all these problems I tried to close my eyes and give it a chance, the game is still in early access.. The last straw of acceptance was an attempt to jump from branch to leaf. The character simply flew through the sheet texture and fell to his death. On the way to the ill-fated branch, I noticed that the environment in general and the grass in particular reacted very selectively to the character. However, if the MOST basic mechanics of the game, a simple jump from platform to platform, does not work, then it is obvious that the game has huge problems!

As of September 12, 2023, I EXTREMELY do not recommend the game. This is a very crude game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Плюсы  -  Надежда что игру не забросят, разработчики сделают выводы из отзывов игроков и доведут игру до нормального состояния.
Минусы  -  Плохая оптимизация графики и геймплея. Низкое качество моделей персонажей.

Игра-""Убийца Grounded"".. Ну-ну, если и так, то случится это когда Grounded исчерпает себя полностью! Да и то, понадобится еще несколько лет после этого.
Проблемы и претензии начались на удивительной оптимизации. ПК у меня не новый, но современные игры легко запускаются на высоких настройках и дают стабильные 60 fps. Даже поделки на UE5, со всеми его наворотами, работают нормально. Здесь редкие 60 кадров плавно перетекают в 20-30 и обратно, а строгая привязка камеры к персонажу делает картинку дерганой. Тут даже непонятно куда уходят ресурсы компьютера. Признаю, освещение хорошее, но вот модели персонажей, объектов окружения и их анимации возвращают меня лет на 10-15 назад. Геймплей сделан под игру от третьего лица, но модель персонажа, которого так-то предлагают создавать, просто ужасна, а варианты выбора деталей внешности один другого хуже. Та же Grounded расчитана преимущественно на игру от первого лица, но даже так модели и текстуры намного лучше!
Впрочем, даже на все эти проблемы я попытался закрыть глаза и дать шанс, игра все же в раннем доступе.. Последней каплей принятия стала попытка спрыгнуть с ветки на лист. Персонаж просто пролетел сквозь текстуру листа и разбился насмерть. По пути до злосчастной ветки, я замечал что окружение в целом и трава в частности очень выборочно реагирует на персонажа. Однако если не работает САМАЯ базовая механика игры, простой прыжок с платформы на платформу, то очевидно что у игры огромные проблемы!

Game Review

It's ok but it really lacks depth so far.  You can only tame about 4 critters total ad they are kinda useless.

I wanted game like this since I was a child and this year I played TWO games in this setting - first was ofc Grounded and second Smalland, so there will be comparing.

Coop:
First of all - it's multiplayer, get few friends and dive into in a squad, you will need someone to share experiences (and split up with bosses). 
Alone or in two it will be much harder, but you can slide bars and make enemies weaker or go in peacefull mode, so difficulty is optional and you can go with your gf or kids. Coop is for 10 (!) players, although we've had some connectivity bugs even in three players, so don't know how it works in this number. Grounded is for 4 max.

Environment and move through it:

Haven't seen so great and beautifully designed piece in a while. Four seasons, day and night, weather - everything helps to good immerze and fantasy setting is nice and armor really looks made out of dead insects. 

Biomes are different, but not repetitive, with many small places and another and another vertical levels. But one con here - in winter, there are still green leaves, blooms etc., just with snow on it, also all insect is around. Winter looks cool (and cold), but could be more interested not only by freezing weather, but by unique enemies or so.

Creatures - what the hell? These dragonflies are like real, but in big scale, you can even count her (yes - her, you will have a bond with some of them) eyes. You could apply this on every insect here, beautiful and scary in some cases, but perfectly designed, real and in different color variations. You can tame some of them and all I can say - firts jump with grasshopper you will just remember. There are some exceptions - frogs and lizards are little clunky, but not many you will met.

Move - except mounts you can use some kinds of catapults, gliding wings and grappling hook. Everyone can use his favourite pet or gadget. In comparison Grounded has ONE useless pet and for jumping from high ground you have dandelion tuft - three or four metres of jump and tuft is broken, so you have to go grind another one).

Water - in Smalland, water is your enemy. You can't swim, you lose stamina and die. Sometimes it's annoying and understand why people hate it. In Grounded you have to swim, pond is one big (and interesting) biome and is part of story. But if you don't like underwater passages, you will hate it.

Combat, weapons and armors:
Combat is not great, not terrible - light att, heavy att, roll, dodge, repeat. If you don't go peacefully and don't have some good mount, you will fight a lot (and die a lot), everything is fast and deadly. For this kind of game is fight enough and don't need more sophisticated combos, but I would appreciate shooting from mount. Grounded had little better combat imo, but it's setting is more childish and armour and weapons was not interesting, maybe ugly. Here you have many nice sets and everyone can choose his favourite, not just one for his ""class"".

Surviving and building:
Surviving isn't much annoying (as I don't like survival games), but in few moments can make some difficulties (in winter, when you can freeze to death). I am not such a builder, so for my little needs it's more then enough and you can build pretty impressive buildings.
Inventory - should be bigger or have option to buy bigger inventory, one of the weaknesses, every tool and equipment is one slot and for gathering you have less than half with all you need.
Idea with base trees is good and moving to another base tree is also good, just one thing - there are many of them, ale very similar (maybe same), could be interesting with some unique modifications for every one of them.

Story:
This could be the main weakness for some players and reason why they preffere Grounded - here is story just a few NPC's which you meet and few dialogues. Story is what you experience, what you make with your party, not what you just got. Also, if you like exploring, in the world are some stories for the observant players. In Grounded is line which you follow, pretty good (and not childish) story.

In fine:
Even I told few negatives, still it's ea and devs looks they have vision and dedication. In few months this could be more polished, with more story or interesting npcs. For 21 E in sale great buy.

If any developer read this long review - thank you for this, it's like you made it for me, gem for relax in fairyland. I see this potential you are cultivating and I will be spreading the word about your game.

Combat is clunky kind of like Last Oasis was like but nearly as bad. Felt more like a Development phase fight system of Dark Souls.

I also wish there were more customization options for the playable character. As a lover of fantasy rpgs and a Skyrim loyalist, it would be nice to see a wider range of body types, classes, magic, etc. The game is very similar to Grounded and I wish there were more elements separating it from other titles in the same genre.

-Good looking map with verticality
-Nice Graphics
Cons:
-Frustrating combat 
-High density of enemies everywhere
-Terrain is difficult to traverse even after getting your first wings
-Getting on a low altitude in the map will have you pull your hair trying to get back up

So far, the most frustrating survival game I have played. The parry mechanic is very hard to use and some enemy will require an almost inhuman reaction time. Blocking also takes a full second before it actually happens. The game doesn't tell you in anyway wich enemies are too strong for you. Storms don't really add anything to the game so far except killing you for... Exploring. 

I don't even want to tame anything beacause the first ladybug I did it with died in less than two minutes and this mechanic is one of the big selling point of the game. 

Your first set of tool has virtualy no durability and damaging them beyond a certain point will cost you alot of ressources. So don't use them?

Alot of flying enemies can hit you from a height you can't fight back.

I so wanted to like this, but the more I play, the more it seems this game doesn't want to be played",1692000744,1692000744,False,2,0,0.394490957260131836,0,True,False,True

It feels more like Souls without the Dark, with tames reminiscent of Ark, in a more graphically realistic (and beautiful) setting than Grounded.  The orchestral music from the onset was surprisingly good and feels professional.  Right now there is a linear quest line progression through NPC interaction.  I hope that the quest lines are fleshed out for full non linear gameplay with more NPCs.

I usually far prefer 1st person game play, but this game plays best in 3rd.  There is too much head bob, input delay, and drunk swaying in 1st.  First person players - don't let that dissuade you.  I adjusted to 3rd person quickly, and now like the interface.

There are some really great things - for instance I love the gliding wings.   Jumping out of a high tree and gliding to a precision landing right on target is satisfying.  Your main tree base can be moved.  You can Improve your character and weapons to the point where something that might have given you trouble at the start is killed in a single shot.

Yes, it is early access, but - I have had zero crashes, and noticed zero bugs.  (At least the programming kind, save maybe a typo in the text.)

The game itself is very well optimized, more so than most non EA games. There are a lot of quality of life features missing but that can be expected from any EA game trying to establish a games full story first.

After 44 hours of gameplay I finished everything the game currently has to offer. That being said the cost of this game brought me far more enjoyment than almost all recent Triple A $60-70 games. This game is a mix of Valheim and Grounded in its essence, but at the same time something unique all to itself. After reading other reviews it is clear that the creator is very adamant about incorporating multiple quirks from different games. This of course, leads to the state of Small lands right now. The game is extremely fun and progressive. In short, it offers the players a lot of layers of gameplay so that the game is not a tunnel vision simulator. 

Grinding. This game does a good job with its access to resources and the ease of collecting them. The combat is like a very minimal dark souls but still offers more than most other survival games out of EA. This alongside the quick resource collection make the game feel less choppy when needing to gather resources.

THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS GAME - The tree base concept was brilliant. I remember playing Minecraft as a kid and wanting to move my house but worldedit would be a pain. This game offers the player a chance to build a teleport-able base as well as bases throughout the world.

Critiques: I am not positive if this issue got fixed but the bark door that can be placed on the tree-house seemed to always despawn when I would move my base. Aside from that, I would recommend really taking advantage of the mount system in this game. As it stands the mounts themselves are almost skippable. In terms of my gameplay, I was able to use the grasshopper to go straight to the hornet. Only gathering the spider and gecko for sheer enjoyment and sense of completion. In short, I think the players should be more steered towards the mounts as it separates this game from many other survival games such as Grounded. Making them uniquely important to the progression of the game and a more optimized way of taming would be huge. One problem I always ran into was having to jump in the water just so I could tell my previous mount to leave the party and hope my new tames insect/reptile was still where it was when I had tames it previously.

I had looked at Grounded but this one looked more interesting for us. We unlocked everything (that I know of). We played Valheim for a while but got bored and the difficulty spike was a bit much in some areas. This one scared the bejesus out of us a few times with creepy crawlers sidling up to you or from behind. Very much enjoyed all the base building options and the fact that there are no timers anywhere so we can take our time with building, collecting, exploring, fighting, strategizing, etc.

You can tame different beasts and while it was fun working to unlock them, we found the travel to still need work. Much preferred to just hop and glide on our own especially once we unlocked the Icarus wings towards the end of the current game. The 500 hoot price for the bird isn't quite worth it, but oh well; since there were two of us, we had to scrounge up 1,000 hoots for two birds.

When we'd see spiders for the first time from afar, we'd say, ""What's that? Was it fuzzy?!"" It took a bit for us to feel like we were powered up enough to just go in and clear them all out. Very fun! Some late nights we'd be playing and getting into the spider areas and couldn't help but keep brushing the hair back from our necks out of habit. Good atmospheres in this game. We appreciated the catapult system for getting around and being able to attach signs to help us remember where certain ones pointed towards.

Interested in seeing where else this game might go. If you're looking for another game to play online co-op with a spouse or friend, this one worked well for us.

It's beautiful , it's mysterious , the lore is captivating, the building is better than many other game in his genera. It's truly rewarding progressing , exploring and reading the interaction between the npc's and you.

I REALLY HOPE THE DEVELOPERS DON'T LET THIS GAME DOWN. keep on building on this foundation, listening to the community, adding more lore , item , new maps in the future !! this game need support and needs to keep going because its that good.

for the little things that need A BIT of work :
-AI would need just a bit more variety in combat.
-building would need just a bit more snapiness ( when placing floors or foundation its SOMETIME hard to get them to snap together )
- rework of clay location ( to often unreachable ^^ )

thats pretty much it ! :)

[i]Smalland[/i] is an enjoyable, if unfinished, entry into the genre of Open World Survival Crafting. As of writing this review, [i]Smalland[/i] is in early access. It is actively being updated, with a new patch having dropped this morning. 

First, the bad. Normally, I would talk about bugs, but... well... you've seen what you are fighting. So let me say that there were almost no [i]unintentional[/i] bugs, and those may soon be gone. There are features that the game is [b]sorely[/b] lacking, most importantly in the area of preventing motion sickness. The game needs an FOV slider. Even more vitally, it needs the ability to turn of first-person head bobbing and the screen shaking during storms. And to allow flying mounts (particularly the blue tit) to hover. Without these, [i]Smalland[/i] is making a lot of players sick. 

There are also QoL improvements that would be nice -- such as being able to craft multiple of an item at once -- but the game already has several good QoL features including sorting and depositing into chests according to content. And I have fair confidence based on the patch today that the desirable improvements will come in time.

That's it. That's all the bad, and there isn't much.

Now for the really good!

Immediate high points for a beautifully hand-crafted world in this age of procedural generation. And the world is brought to life with weather and changing seasons. 

In any large open world, some sort of Fast Travel is a must. But [i]Smalland[/i] opts to offer alternatives to player teleportation. NPCs will teach you recipes to help tame certain animals, some of which you can ride. You can build catapults to launch you high into the air. Which is fantastic when combined with wings that allow you to glide. A good tree-top base with multiple catapults, and I was able to get almost anywhere in short order.

Depending on which direction you travel, you can get those wings fairly quickly. This is a true open world, and with the exception of the late game zone, none of the areas are gated by progression. You can encounter the NPCs and areas in any order. NPCs stay in one place and have limited dialogue, often giving a quest and and/or moving the story forward. Plus, they unlock armor schematics, including those precious wings.

(Sadly, until you get wings, your only Fast Travel option is to quit to the menu and then re-enter. This will put your character back at their spawn point, ostensibly the home you are crafting. I did this a [i]lot[/i].)

One of the coolest features of the game: While you can build almost anywhere, there are a bunch of great oak trees with very big building areas on top of them, well away from any threats. After you jumping puzzle your way up your first one, you unlock the ability to claim a tree as your own and make it where you build your house. The great oaks come with a cool hot air balloon that will take you up or down so you never have to do the jumping puzzle again.

The best part, though, is that you can you can claim another tree later and your entire base will move to that location, unclaiming the previous tree. This means you can move your house to areas you want to access quickly as you progress. It's like someone looked at the C.A.M.P. system from [i]Fallout 76[/i] and said ""Let's do that, but make it awesome.""

Base building in the game is beautiful! There are a delightful variety of building pieces, and the game includes an advanced rotation option that allows you to flip pieces about for a far greater building variety than in most OWSC games I have enjoyed ([i]Grounded[/i] included). Once I unlocked the highest tier building pieces, I started tearing down the ramshackle hodgepodge I had been living in and building my true player home. And it was glorious!

Given the BIG points of similarity -- that you are tiny and you are fighting bugs in an Open World Survival Crafting game -- it is nearly impossible to avoid comparisons between [i]Smalland[/i] and [i]Grounded[/i]. Both give you a lovingly hand-crafted world to explore from the point of view of someone very small. 

But the feeling of the games are very different. [i]Grounded[/i] is polished and cartoony, with Mad Scientists wielding Weird Science in a nostalgia-inducing riff on the 1980's. [i]Smalland[/i] feels more somber. You are a member of a pixie-like race existing in the world post-humanity. Some apocalypse happened to the ""giants"" some time ago, and you neither know nor care what.

Your mission is to scout out threats to your people in the hear and now. Something is making the insects more aggressive. And your Queen is dying and in need of an elixir to cure her condition. These are your concerns.

The world of [i]Grounded[/i] feels more solidly put together. The sense of scale is more consistent than in [i]Smalland[/i] where ants are several times the size of bottlecaps. In [i]Grounded[/i], practically everything was fully meshed. You could jump between blades of grass, climb ferns, and use mushrooms as archery platforms. In [i]Smalland[/i], most of the non-resource vegetation is only exists visually, and several things that do have meshes (like mushrooms) are designed so you slide off them.

Overall, the game is definitely worth buying and trying if Open World Survival Crafting is your jam.",1691027537,1691028756,True,149,0,0.913567483425140381,0,True,False,True

So, this game is early access and there are certainly many things that could be improved. I'm sure they will down the line, but I'd like to address the ones that caused me the most grief. 

Cons:

First and foremost, the tamed bugs. They are an awesome concept and I did make it to endgame so I have tamed them all. While the concept is awesome, the execution nearly made me quit the game. The amount of time a tamed bug pushed me off a ledge, got in the way of a killing blow, or decided to just fly away when I was trying to mount it was infuriating. The AI needs a massive update and the mounts need to have their collision turned off with the player. They also need to stick with you better and not fly beyond your interaction range (you can't interact while jumping). Additionally, they do very little damage in combat and die so very easily. I lost quite a high leveled combat bug due to ??? reasons. It just died one day and I had no idea what caused it. So yeah, the tamed bugs were the biggest source of frustration.

Second, the placement of certain resources. There are resources that cling to walls. SOME of them are reachable from the ground, but most of them you have to either jump and swing your pick to get it, or find a way to jump on it perfectly and mine it while standing on it. Additionally there are a massive amount of resources just stuck under the terrain? It makes trying to find the actual mineable resources hard to see.

Third, the structure support requirement for building. This is not explained anywhere in game. If you have played Valheim or 7 Days to Die, you are familiar with the need to have a certain amount of support underneath your buildings in order to build higher and stronger materials provide more support. However, unlike them, there's no indication that you need it until the moment you hit it. Then you get a pretty vague message about ""no building support"". I didn't decide to make my main base in game until the end and having my grand designs suddenly shot down because of this sudden discovery again almost made me quit in frustration. This needs to be clarified right away both in explanation and visually.

Ok, those are my main frustrations. There are a few more gripes, but they didn't really make me that upset and they will probably be improved over time. Mainly things like clunky combat and the way you kinda bounce of certain terrain. Now here is why despite that, I love this game.

Pros:

Like I'm sure many others did, I thought this was gonna be a Grounded clone, though I read a comment saying this game was announced first but the bigger studio jumped on the idea so I don't really know. I can tell you that even despite the lack of polish of Grounded, this game is far superior in my opinion. The direction that I am seeing this game going towards is just awesome. It went for a more fantasy based vibe which they nailed. The environment is so cool looking. The music is also on point. My friend described it as a mix between Star Wars and Harry Potter, though I got a more FF14 feeling from it. In any case, it was great. 

Another great thing, despite the aforementioned frustrations with it, was the bug taming. I love the idea and the different types and uses. End game stuff is phenomenal, and the thrill you get of finally getting it and experiencing it as it completely changes the experience of the game. Sadly once you do get it, there currently no game left to really use it lol.

The options and designs of the various materials you get for creating your base(s) are awesome. I just all around love everything about your building options. The only gripe I have is that I wish you could sort by material. Tracking down the piece you want can get tedious. Just cool. 

The various armors and weapons are super cool looking. I did accidentally skip a few since it was just easier to immediately go to the next set, but that happens in most games. It's a pretty common theme in the game, but all the visuals are on point. Things in the game all look cool. I hope they implement a button to hide your helmet though. I designed my character then after the first hour, never saw my face ever again lol.

The visual lore. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but they hint at a lot of things just by the stuff you find exploring world. I like that kind of story telling, where they reward you for looking around and paying attention. Speaking of rewarding exploration, make sure you explore everywhere, they definitely have a few rewards for people who are thorough.

Lastly, you can transfer your main base to any number of ""Great Trees"" dotted around the map. This is awesome. If you have any bugs chilling up there, it moves them too. This is such a nice feature if you are going to be farming resources in a specific area and want to move your main base close to that area.

Anyway, that's a summation of my main thoughts on the game. I give it a 7.5/10 at its current state with the potential being a 9-9.5 I think. There are many things I didn't mention both good and bad as they either didn't contribute much to my feelings in the game, or it's something I expect to be updated naturally as the game gets developed. I cannot wait to see the progress they make and I fully endorse this game as a lover of the base-building survival genre.",1690942396,1690942470,True,6,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,True

Recent updates that allowed you to carry larger stacks of items and a experience/leveling system improved the game play so much <3

Other Reasons: Its fun having mounts and the actual ability to glide through the air with the wings you craft, the world has lots of places to explore and find some nice little hidden secrets, aesthetics looks great and not as cartoony like grounded. (not bright and cheerful like the grounded game)

Combat: Is simple...do not block!  it takes more stamina to block the attacks then it does to dodge them and you still get hurt so just dodging at the right time uses less energy and you receive no damage at all. Degradation of gear as its used or armor when taking damage is a little much at first and breaks quickly but its easy to just carry the materials around and build a work bench, if items are not damaged too much then repairs are free. (no matter the amount of damage on gear in grounded, it will cost you something to repair)   Taming mounts does require you to advance through the story lines but its worth it and more so when you get a flying one.

Grievances i have with the game are a few but really bother me a lot...

Inventory: The armor you wear takes up space in your inventory, i find it extremely annoying and i realize this is a game but....if your carrying a backpack and wearing clothing...some how your clothing is still filling up your backpack?!  So thanks to their system in this regard you lose the ability to carry 5 additional items or resources and you are unable to use mounts to carry items (never tried the lady bugs) This makes planning for fights or just gathering materials a little more difficult as a solo player.

Mounts: The variety is really nice but they are kind of stale in their ability? it would be nice to have something like a spider actually be able to climb walls and have a strong bite/venom, give the damselfly a faster flight speed in trade for being fragile, wasps being able to carry items like a mule or maybe carry another player since their so big (i have not had the chance to get the sparrow mount yet as i write this) i think it would help make the mounts more versatile so you get what one is more helpful for your needs or just make them more fun to use. A big problem i have is you are only able to have one at a time.....if you lose your mount? time to tame a new one! or if want to get....lets say a flying mount to get around better, you have to give up the one you currently have to claim the new mount. i would love to see a stable or something that allows you to have at least one additional mount as a back up or at least let you get the chance to experiment with mounts to find the one you like ""without!"" tossing away a good one you have kept and worked on for a long time...it was a nice grasshopper and i miss them :<  (Stables seem to be a future release item and in the works so we have to wait)

I have also on several occasions have my wasp mount push me to my death which has been more then annoying and you are unable to get on your mount unless its close enough for you to reach it (cant jump up and get on, it has to come low enough with you staying on the ground) since it wont sit still...this has cause me to be very annoyed more often then not and just leave them behind until i need a ride home.

Story line/Quests:  The codex is not very helpful when im trying to find out what i need to do next or where i need to go, i dont know if this is just a development issue that will be solved later or just how it will remain, (far as i know the game is still being developed) there have been several times where i am not given much other then vague direction ""follow the giants ruins north"" unless its an area still in development, i could not find what i was looking for and the quest does not leave any markers so its a blind hunt for me. (i have also had the boss spider in the swamps not get marked even though the text said my map was updated was one issue i had that might just be a glitch) 

Grapple Hook: Works more like a drunken poor mans ""spiderman"" swing, the initial use will pull you up a few feet and any other subsequent use will only bring you lower to the ground, you are unable to gain momentum by swinging back and forth, you are not allowed to climb up or jump off (you just fall straight down trying) it can be helpful crossing small gaps or trying to get a little boost up over something...its generally useless otherwise and a waste of resources. (it saved me once from being stuck so i did not have to use the ""unstuck"" option in the game)

Unstuck Button:  To keep this simple...it kills you and you respawn, if you have ""drop items on death"" enabled ....good luck getting your stuff back. This has been a bane from the start but i am very happy they have the option to turn off dropping items when you die, i have gotten stuck very often and would never play the game again if this option was not available. 

Combat: Ranged combat is rather limited and not very viable against targets when your a solo player, first strike when they are not aggroed to you does a good amount of damage but any after that does minimal amounts and the durability of bows is terrible in my opinion even with the best bow currently in the game. You are forced into melee combat every time because of this, sneaking does nothing to hide you in combat so dont even bother trying at this point. (ai will always know where you are) burning and poison arrows really dont do much and i find them nothing more then a waste of materials, always use the next higher arrow when you can to help increase the damage. (blow gun was not worth even trying in my opinion as it uses stealth? poison darts and poison does so little compared to the arrows) enemies with high health can just soak up poison damage with little trouble while you will suffer from it more (black widow bites will take a lot of hp out per tick) 4 or 2 hp per tick does add up with your opponents at least, the duration is extended with each hit on you as the timer stacks but it will not on them, the timer just refreshes...a bit unfair i think) 

Overall the game has been a blast to play and fun in more ways then it is not, their new update added even more and with the new wings introduced (love the Icarus gear) getting around the world has been so much easier and less of a headache without a mount, i find it easy enough to play solo with a simple story/quest line so far and hope to see it flushed out more, maybe even get to learn what happened to all the giants (humans) that used to live there.  Grounded is a nice and fun game, i can honestly say i like this one more and plan to keep playing it and plan to re write my review later as things change or develop. <3

Problems:
1. You see the whole world of interesting things... and you can't interact with anything. You can't cut the grass you see (you need to collect ""grass resource"" from small green batches, same for wood: you can't cut inside the huge skyscrapping trees which cover the sky, you need to... collect small branches hidden in the big grass leaves you can't chop. And it goes and goes: not much things to interact with except 
2. bugs and beetles, who move so weird you will thing like they are strafing in CS:GO. They can attack through your house walls and spiders in arachnofobic mode are even scarier than in real life.
3. zoning and quests: thanks for some kind of a story, but the very first quest led me to the area where I can't mine any resources because I have no tools for that. I returned to the original location only to realise I will need several hours to gather resources not because there's a lot to do, but because I... CAN'T FIND DAMN RESOURCES ON THE MAP!

For now it is indeed the unfinished Valheim clone and doesn't deserve the amount of time it demands because it doesn't provide any unique or quality experience. I wish the developers the best, will try again on release.",1690873712,1690873712,False,1,1,0.476481348276138306,0,True,False,True

Since then, the game has been growing on me.


The white flash they thought was a good idea every time you trigger antennae vision starts to hurt my eyes pretty fast, especially considering how often you'll have to flash yourself while looking for resources.  Game breaker by itself?  No.  A deterrent for people who can't take bright flashes from getting anywhere?  Certainly.

Mostly like a problem that will be modded out if the it's left in through release, but it's a bad sign when my first thoughts on a new game are ""how to fix it so I can play.""

Travel - Just look for videos on where to acquire the early set of wings.  Before you get these, travel is so aggravating.

Regardless of what anyone says, you WILL want to build mini bases ALL OVER the map, with workbench and catapult (once you get wings) before you will halfway enjoy traveling around.

After 22 hours of exhilarating gameplay, we can't help but be captivated by this charming world and its immersive survival experience. With bated breath, we eagerly await more content to explore in this stunning micro-world.

The co-op mode added a whole new dimension to the game. Working together with my partner to overcome the challenges and adversities in this tiny wilderness was an absolute blast. The intricate details and the sense of scale within Smalland's world are truly remarkable, making us feel like intrepid explorers in a land of giants.

From the moment we started our journey, the game's stunning visuals and art style immediately captured our attention. The attention to detail in the flora and fauna, the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, and the cleverly designed environmental puzzles all added to the game's charm.

Smalland's survival mechanics felt intuitive and rewarding. Collecting resources, crafting tools, and building shelters were not only essential for survival but also deeply satisfying. The game struck a perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment, keeping us engaged without being overly frustrating.

What truly impressed us was the seamless transition between day and night cycles, each bringing their unique set of challenges. While the days were bustling with opportunities, the nights became a test of our survival skills as predators emerged from the shadows. This dynamic environment kept us on our toes and made the experience feel incredibly dynamic and alive.

Despite completing the game, we still find ourselves wanting more. Although 22 hours of gameplay is substantial, the endearing world of Smalland has us yearning for further adventures and discoveries. We have high hopes for future updates that will undoubtedly expand the game and introduce new wonders for us to uncover.

The game's developers deserve immense praise for creating such an enchanting and polished experience. Smalland: Survive the Wilds is a shining example of what a well-crafted survival adventure can be, and we are excited to see how it evolves in the future.

In conclusion, Smalland: Survive the Wilds is an enthralling co-op adventure that we wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking an unforgettable gaming experience.

This game has already given me more play time than many so-called AAA titles. Off the top of my head, Jedi: Fallen Order took me just under 19 hours to 100%, and it cost me 60 USD. I got Smalland for a third of that cost, and in the beginning stages of its early access it already has more content. I have only a few things left to do, and those will probably take me a handful of hours. Hell, even the polish on Fallen Order is equivalent to this game.

It shares quite a few things with other survival craft games. There is a tier system that locks specific resources away behind each level of tools/weapons. You gain access to increasingly better mounts, except for the grasshopper, which you get pretty fast and is extremely useful. There are boss level creatures, even though they need a bit of work to actually be dangerous. They recently added levels. It is a simple system. You get three points per level, and there are 100 levels with four stats to choose from: damage, movement speed, health, stamina.

The story is a bit basic. It consists of completing a number of secondary tasks, facilitating the completion of the primary task. Unlike most games in the same genre, the development team makes use of NPCs. Smalland has some pretty great potential. If you don't go for early access games, make sure you put this on your wishlist and check back from time to time.

PROS:

GRAPHICS:

In terms of graphics, this game is absolutely amazing. The graphics and rendering are gorgeous, and it really feels like you’re a tiny person/wingless fairy of your own design (there's character customization) in a gigantic, beautiful forest. I was mesmerized by the detail on every tree root, all the lights and shadows, and the plants that are taller than you. Which leads me to the next part…

GEAR & BASE BUILDING
You can create tools out of smaller plants and use them to gather those larger plants, as well as lots of other resources, like wood, stone, flint, and parts from bugs you've killed, to make armor and weapons. You'll need them in order to defend yourself from those bugs and forest creatures that are all larger than you are, because they *will* kill you - sometimes very quickly - if you don’t have proper defenses. 

You can also build small shelters in safe locations from gathered materials, and even claim the top of a giant tree as your own personal base! You can use it to store everything you’ve collected, build a safe place to sleep, shelter from thunderstorms, and cook higher-quality meals to take with you using the food items you gather. Food fills your hunger meter more quickly when it’s cooked and prepared, so make sure you do so by building a cauldron or a campfire, and use the recipes provided!

EXPLORING:
Even though it can be very hard/frustrating at times, exploring in this game is AWESOME. As long as you have the right gear and are stocked up on food, and you're careful, you can go pretty much anywhere that's not underwater. There are six different biomes to explore (at least so far - the developers might add more content eventually).

CONS:

LOTS OF WAYS TO DIE:
- You can drown in deep water (your character can't swim - don't even try! AND IF YOU FALL IN WATER WHILE RIDING YOUR PET, IT WILL DIE TOO, and you'll have to tame a new one!), 
- be overwhelmed by mobs of bugs (if you attack one bee, ALL the other bees nearby will come after you!), 
- freeze to death in those storms I mentioned (if you don’t build a campfire and find - or make - a decent shelter quickly enough), 
- overheat from too-hot weather (without proper gear), 
- starve (if you don’t eat enough food for too long), 
- or fall from a great height without riding a tamed grasshopper or having winged/gliding armor (Yes - you read right: wing armor! YAY!). 

NOTE: There are meter-bars that indicate how hungry and how comfortable you are, and there are flashing warnings when the hunger bar gets too low, or when your character gets too hot or too cold - so it’s not too hard to keep track of your character's health. What *is* hard is maintaining it at a decent level.

Furthermore, if you die, you come back with HALF health.

Also, there's no fast-travel.

Adding to this, it can also be a chore gathering those resources that you need to have easy access to in order to stay alive. I spent two real-life days’ worth of playtime gathering and building until I had enough materials to be able to make a house that would fit everything I needed, and stay standing in a storm (created structures can wear out and be destroyed by bad weather if they’re not protected).

FINAL VERDICT:

Overall, this game is very, very fun, but also can be hard to play. The base-building is my favorite part. I love that you can build anything you want, but you still have to follow the laws of physics, so that the gameplay feels realistic (ie. you can’t build a house without foundations, or floating on water, in midair, or on a curved/uneven surface like an angled tree root or on rocky ground). Like I said before, the gathering of resources feels like a chore after a while, but it’s worth it in the end if you manage to build a beautiful house starting from nothing - especially one that has everything you need to survive the wilds another day!

So, the bottom line: if you're looking for a fairly difficult game with great graphics and lots of basic (and some not-so-basic) survival techniques, and an amazing and beautifully designed world to explore, this one is worth playing. 7/10 stars.",1681256245,1690650368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As an avid lover of insects and spiders and Lord of the Rings, this game hits right into my little corner of heaven. I love how realistic the models are. I love the twisty building parts and the elven look that everything has. And I LOVE that I can have different mounts that have special individual skillsets. The first time I leapt with a grasshopper and went flying across the map, my mouth dropped open. So cool!!

I was really on the fence with some of the reviews saying that combat was super difficult, but since I started playing, I found both the controls and combat to be super smooth. This was after the update that added the parry move, which does make combat feel a lot more sturdy. The timing feels a little late at times and swarms of bugs are still a problem, but I feel like when I die, its because of foolishness on my part, not of the game.

I also read that there isnt a plot, but clearly there is a very definitive one. The way pieces are being told by NPCs is really cool, and it makes the world feel more alive. I love that you learn new armor sets from the NPCs themselves as well. Normally, survival games are just the players in an open, empty world. I love that this beautiful world has lore tucked into various little bases built by its characters.

My biggest issues at the moment:
- Equipped items stay in inventory, taking up space.
- No way to turn off the annoying delayed ""Double Click""
- Pets die. So quickly. Let my baby live. Let me give them armor, maybe?
- Water. Give me more time before the unavoidable slip of death. What am I made out of rocks?
- Block/Parry seems delayed, hard to time",1690604381,1690604381,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I can turn this game to about 50/50 Medium & High settings,w a 3060Ti and get over 100 fps solid, and sometimes even hit that elusive 144 that I'm supposed to run at natively. Nice! And it still looks beautiful It runs on Ultra at 60fps solid as well. 
The world is quite big, though, I wish there was even more. Seems like the perfect game for a map expansion dlc which I would gladly pay for. 

There are some things I dont like. 
I don't really want to be an elf character. But you can make a fat guy!! FINALLY in a game like this. So, I like that. 
There are too many mobs in general, and going anywhere requires tedious dispatching of mobs that waste your time like a souls game or mmo. I wish that was a thing of the past. And if you play default, the balance is bad for single player especially early on. However, due to the fact that there are excellent monster damage & HP sliders, there are NOT balance issues - you can tailor it yourself. I decided not to deal with the stupid 'track down your backpack when you die' game that all survival games end up being, so I simply turned that off. And despite that its way more casual, I dont care. It's 100 times better than constantly raging, like I do in Grounded. 
(If they removed these sliders, like ARK did, then I would change my recommendation to negative. Like I did with ARK. )
Also, I wish that you could turn the sliders past 100% - for instance, for Nutrition, as food subgame is a little too easy for me with the other sliders turned down. 

As usual when I play survival games for the first time, I'm moving slowly through the progression, and haven't seen half of the game yet, but screw it, I will go ahead and say it - This game gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

Gameplay:
Amazing verticality, fun crafting progression and character progression that is lasting much longer than I thought. A lot of recipes for cooking and crafting. Building system is amazing, allows so much control, you can really let your creativity go nuts and still be able to achieve your vision for your foresty home. Worth mentioning that you can claim Giant Trees and make your base at the top. And a really cool mechanic about that is that you can import your tree-top base in your friend's games if that tree is available !
Pets are definitely a huge +, too bad there aren't that many at this stage. Encounters with new foes are nothing but terrifying, and overcoming them nothing but gratifying. Can't wait to see what else they come up with. 
Note: I've only played PVE so far. 

Graphics:
I have the game on full ultra. It is significantly stylised, and yet absolutely gorgeous. The map is made with a lot of care to offer thrilling exploration and stunning sights. They really nailed the ""I feel so tiny"" effect. The day, weather and season system offer all sorts of lighting scenarios that sometimes make you re-discover parts of the map under the right circumstances. Volumetric rays, depth of field, lens flares, they've got all these goodies that make the game super pretty.

Performance:
I run a decent PC (RTX 3070, AMD Ryzen 3700x) and the game only ever crashed twice, only while using the antenna vision. It's a smooth experience with no FPS loss/drops. I mean, the game IS full of bugs, just not the technical kind (yes it's a joke HAHA laugh please).

I can focus on  creating elaborate houses and structures in massive tree tops

It's kinda like a less cheesy Grounded, with a bit of a fantasy twist. There are a handful of issues, but so far every update has made strides in fixing them. The game is fun in the state it is, though it does lack a good sense of direction for the actual story. Building options are pretty limited right now, but there is still room for some creative base builds with what you have.
My biggest complaint is that mechanics aren't really explained to you. The biggest example is the tree bases; each player can claim a ""great tree"" and build a base atop it. However, if you're hosting the world and you and your friend are working together to build a base but they are the one who claimed the tree, once they leave your world the base goes with them. My friend and I spent hours building our base on a tree he claimed and storing all of our stuff there, when he logged out, I was pushed to the tree entrance and left looking at an empty tree. I claimed the tree, hoping the stuff would come back, but instead it remained empty but was 'mine'. Next time we played he had to find a new tree and claim it for us to be able to get our stuff. He also can't claim a base in a single player world on his own with that character without that base popping up. So really, I don't see the point of having multiple worlds since the tree bases are linked to characters not worlds. Just an annoying thing I wish I'd known earlier so we could've better planned who claimed the base.

yes the fps can be an issue for some but not that ive seen personally. issue with the new update terrain  (park area ) struggling to place workbench on ground, compared to the rest of the map it keeps colliding with terrain which is extremely frustrating.

would love to see improvements to mounts-Toggle following distance ( flying mounts try to catch up and end up pushing you off edges or nudging you ) would be a well needed quality of life improvement 

all mobs should level roughly with your skill level. ( currently im level 50 in attributes but if i want to find a new mount lets say a grasshopper i only see level 5-15) surely they should be closer to my level",1690132853,1690132853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

... However I would put this more as a ""I will wait until it is more fleshed out before getting more into it.""

Every creature is hostile, making it is almost impossible not to chew through all your food/bandages to just walk a short distance to the next quest hub. Travel is so slow, which isn't bad in itself, however it is genuinely frustrating when you die and have to go back to your body; only to probably die again from hordes of bugs which can usually outrun you.
The [spoiler]Rhino Beetle[/spoiler] boss was way too hard (we died constantly). Not sure if we accidentally skipped previous mission zones or what - but this appeared to be the first mission from an NPC.

- Tree Base moves WITH player
- Endless Creativity

- Not too specific on how to craft items, you will spend a lot of time finding resources to learn how
- Pets teleport to you immediately when you load in the world (Yes inside your base as well)
- Overall just some small bug here and there (as to be expected since it's Early Access)

A lot of the game play feels extremely basic and not well developed. The map is fairly small and easy to travel across. The challenges are few and quickly become repetitive. There are mounts, but they are really serve no purpose. There's a few different things to craft but no real reason to craft most of them. There's structures to build but no real reason to build them. Basically, there's a few things to do but not a lot of point to doing them.

Currently the devs are asking you to pay what is really full price for a game that's about 20% complete, if that, so your purchase is funding the development of the rest of the game, and that's always a risk. Steam is littered with ""early access"" games that took everyone's money and failed to deliver on their most basic promises.

Smalland has some great features that already make it worth a try, but could put it right at the top of that list if development is done well

The game has an interesting setting and plenty of content at the time of this review - certainly enough to warrant the comparatively low price. There is a huge map with a variety of biomes, lots of unique creatures and sights to see. It also has weather systems and seasons, although I think these could be expanded on in the future to make them feel more important. I haven't encountered any major bugs, excuse the pun, in the first 20 hours of gameplay and the AI is decent enough. I haven't tried multiplayer, however the function exists and looks pretty straightforward.

What really sets this game apart from its rivals, however, is the thought the dev team has clearly put into reducing or removing the frustrating parts of these type of games. There is a system for building bases which not only allows you to make your base public or private, but also if you want to move to a new part of the map, your whole base - buildings, tame creatures, even your chests full of all your hard earned loot - is moved, intact, at the click of a button! The repair system also allows you to repair items for free if you do so often rather than waiting for items to break, which is a lifesaver when you are a the far end of the map and don't have the right resources. Everywhere you look, there are little things the devs have put in to reduce frustration and increase quality of life, and it just makes this game so playable.

I dont have anything negative to say about Smalland at this point - far from it! However, I would say that there is plenty of opportunity for the devs to take this from being a great game to being a genre-leader. Story isn't something that necessarily goes hand in hand with open world survival games, however with the incredible setting I think more could be done to flesh this out a little.

Combat is not super difficult, being mainly based on learning attack timings, and together with the fantastic quality of life features, the game feels very forgiving. I would say this game design caters more to casual players, or those less experienced in this genre, which is a clever move as some open world games can be huge time sinks. At 20 hours of gameplay, I feel around half way through the content of the game in its current state - but I doubt completing the storyline would be the end of the game for me and I am sure there are plenty more hours of enjoyment to get out of it once that is done.",1689377943,1689377943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Great tree transfers are also a HUGE help! Being able to transfer your base to anywhere in the map as long as there is a Great tree really assists the player as this map is massive... 

While the bug mechanics can be a bit janky at times, it's nice knowing the devs are actively working on this. The variety of weapons/armor etc is really gives the game a grind feel, but not to the extent of Ark. It's balanced. From gathering, gliding in the air, killing local arachnids, to even cooking, it's all so satisfying and relatively easy to grasp. 

The only con that I have but can also understand is the durability of your weapons/tools.
You can go out for maybe 20 minutes with a flint sword, bow, and flint pic axe, and those suckers will be broken after maybe 15 bugs killed and flint ores harvested. I can also get behind this however as the higher you go, the better durability, that's where the grind can either be super motivational or discouraging, depending on the type of player you are. 

This game at it's state right now deserves at least an 8.5/10 but I can already see it rising to a 10 with how active the devs have been on this one!

1. Base building.
Have the great tree is convenient, but removes most of the fun factor of base building in a survival game. There is no risk, there is no variation in terrain, you can teleport your base to new parts of the map. You only need to build one.

This is hard to suggest anything other then get rid of the great trees, or keep them but allow us to build defenses and give us the tools to make building bases on the ground or in other places useful.

2. Mounts
IF you don't have the wing suit then some mounts can be great for traversing the world. The second you get a wing suit that goes out of the window pretty much. 
The combat abilities of the mounts are horrendous. Even the wolf spider whom should be the scary thing you ride everything down in is barely able to hold its own against a couple flies/mosquitoes.
Jumping can be dangerous at best on a grasshopper as water kills it instantly and probably you.

We need variation in ability, and capability for the mounts to be really meaningful and useful. Each one should offer something useful and unique and they should be able to stand their ground and hold their own based on what they are.

One thing that I think would add to the game is being able to domesticate all the insects.  And make it so each one has different advantages.

I would like to see many more tames, and with better abilities for the tames. But, I also understand this game isn't Ark. At the same time, I think they can find a happy medium that will appeal to all players.

A lot of people have compared this game to Grounded but see the differences between the two. The characters in this game are more fairy-like and you can build tree houses that can transfer over when you join other people's servers -- pretty cool! You can also make your tree houses private so if you're ever worried about other players stealing, it'd be safe.

Although still in early access, there is a story line, you fight bosses and there are many things you can craft in the game. I can't believe it's still in Early Access because the game already offers so much. You can also have pets in the game which makes the experience so much better. I love how grindy the game is but resources respawn fairly quickly even if you have many players in the server. The difficulty of the game can also be customized so you can play it based your preferences.

The only complaints I have are the animations need some work (nothing horrible, just look off), there are too many hostile bugs (going anywhere is a slog unless you run past stuff or have good weapons and armor), and the spiders can't climb walls (seriously the whole point of having a spider mount is being able to walk up walls and it struggles with steep inclines).

I'm enjoying it. Building takes some getting used to, and there are a lot of design aspects you can utilize if you're into that. Crafting initially looks like a grind, but only if you're trying to build something huge. I found it fun to build little outposts in the different areas when exploring and later use them when I wanted to collect resources. I think it would be more fun with friends, though I haven't found an area I would like to build a real house in beyond the starter area as I haven't found anything flat that doesn't have a lot of hostile insects around.

Grounded is a story-driven game with survival elements, where you MUST progress with the story to get further unlocks. Smalland on the other hand IS a survival sandbox. Unlocks are given for talking with NPCs, picking up materials the first time, placing down crafting stations, and killing bosses.

Combat is very souls-esque, having to closely monitor limited stamina for dodging and attacking enemies, with the same dodge-dance mechanics in place. There is a block/parry option, but block only reduces damage and parry is very difficult to trigger.

Taming is limited to 5 mounts and a pack-mule ladybug, the latter unfortunately being a burden. It dies too easily and gets scared of any mob, running away and aggroing another 8 enemies on you. Mounts are varied and all have their unique mobility options which is nice.

The treetop building system is simply genius, it allows you to A) relocate your fully built base to any other great tree on the map with a click B) Bring your base with you to another multiplayer session, so you can maintain steady progression. Base building follows the staple rules (foundations, walls, roofs, etc) seen in other survival games (Valheim/Ark/Rust) albeit more forgiving and allowing more freedom.

The map is well designed and complex, the forest looks beautiful, and seasons change too to shake up the visuals. The way crafting works you will have to frequently revisit locations for different materials. It is not ""tiered territory"" where you would never get back to some zones as you progressed through the game.

Overall a very pleasant experience, even in Early Access. With 10 hours of playtime @ review, It feels like there's another 10+ hours worth of content ahead still.",1688510109,1688510109,True,2,0,0.504310309886932373,0,True,False,True
768200,141327579,76561198062766714,0,7,324,0,324,1688506927,"So this is my current take on the game. Take it as how it is at this time as my review will change in the future depending on how the game is developed and how its developers respond. 

Pros:

- Gives a vibe of Strange Magic.
- Crafting is rather straight forward and the tutorial is quite nice. 
- Buildings and structures are fun to interact with and have a nice style. 

Cons: 

- You have to turn on and off your game in order to reconnect to friends. 
- Most main creature models are store bought assets (I hope this changes later on in the future)
- The game crashes and fatal errors a lot. 

Have yet to experience the following due to crashes

- Story
- All areas (I had gotten as far as the rhino beetle area and the geckos)
- Yet to really do building crafting fully.

So this is rather short given that I have played 5.4 hours on it as of now, why this is? Well I kept having fatal errors even after I had done verifying files and even a reinstall. I am unsure of what is causing these issues but that along with having to restart the game twice is a bit grating and time consuming given its load time. As for the assets part I mentioned there is not anything wrong with assets, however I myself do not like it when the main aspects of the game are assets themselves. Creatures that you see and deal with frequently in a game which is a survival game should have a consistent style. Assets such as environmental and so forth I do not mind as they are not a main focus point of a video game and often help assist in streamlining the workflow, its only when the main focal point of the game is assets that it doesn't bode well with most individuals.

I do hope to see custom assets in the future, along with custom animations for these interactive models. Sometimes I notice the bugs sliding or becoming stuck and unable to do much. Other times there are issues with matching quality but this is just a nit pick and nothing major. I just am under the belief that your main focus of a game should be custom or at least be saved up to be custom. 

What is major however is the current bugs within the build, and I ain't talking about the creatures in this one. Connecting to a friend I have noticed has caused me to get booted out of their host server and if I attempt to reconnect it does not do so. I have to shut completely out of the game and then relaunch it from steam in order to even join. The hotkey bar will vanish and appear which makes it difficult to assign your items to it, and during fatal crashes you lose everything you had done via progression for. If you verify game files nothing will come up, at least for me, and I have not been able to find a fix or a work around. Not even lowering my graphics settings will help with this. 

So all and all as of right now? 

- No I will not recommend this game to anyone in its current state. 

Do I think the game will get better?

 - Absolutely but this depends also on the direction the developers handle it. The game has a lot of promise and I hope to see more of what is to come with it. Once a few patches roll out I will play again to see if that fixes any of these fatal crashes however as of right now I can no longer currently touch it to experience the rest of the game.",1688508389,1688508389,False,4,0,0.55160832405090332,0,True,False,True

Pros:

[list]
[*]Art style is really cool, definitely a unique take on the 'small world' survival crafting aesthetic and the armor sets look a lot more intricate and detailed than in Grounded. Kind of wish there were a bit more fantasy elements to it, but it's a great start.
[*]Game runs great so far, have a bit of stuttering when first booting it up but performance is solid for this soon into Early Access.
[*]Next to no intrusive cutscenes. Sleeping to transition through the night takes only a couple seconds, tutorial is quick and gives you the basics. NPCs can be found and interacted with to give you hints and unlock recipes for armor and other useful items. This can also be a double-edged sword, however, such as when you have to wait half a minute to travel up to and down from a 'Great Tree' base by balloon lift.
[*]'Great Tree' base system is a very welcome addition to the genre. When you climb a giant tree you can 'claim' it, and the top of the tree is a blank canvas with no mob spawns for building bases and safehouses. If you're playing in multiplayer, you can make it private and prevent them from building anything in your private base or allow others to build with you if you want. You can also easily move your 'Great Tree' base to a different one, which transfers what you built to a new tree.
[*]Lots of potential creature mounts with different attributes, can be expanded upon in future updates.
[*]You have a built-in resource sensing mode that your character can use to track down and identify nearby resource nodes and mobs, which alleviates some of the difficulty in tracking them down or avoiding hostile creatures.
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
[*]Combat is a complete mess. The game tries to do a few things Grounded does, and Grounded's combat already isn't fantastic by any means, but Smalland's as of this writing is much more repetitive and janky. Hit detection is awful and all over the place. Enemy AI is sporadic and way too random - sometimes it will attack twice or even three times rapidly in succession, sometimes it won't attack at all for long periods of time, sometimes it will circle you several times before finally deciding to suddenly attack. Enemy attack patterns are currently very basic - most enemies right now have only one or two attacks that they use over and over again. There are parries like in Grounded, but the way-too-variable enemy AI and shoddy hit detection makes the parry very inconsistent and difficult to time right. Unlike Grounded, there is also a dodge-roll, but it is next to useless in comparison since a successful parry stuns enemies for a bit, and their random AI makes attacking them too much of a gamble if you don't parry them first. One of the first hostile mob types you encounter are beetles that are resistant to most forms of damage except for piercing, which requires a bow and some arrows (and as soon as you shoot them they dart at you into melee range, and they attack very quickly) or a spear (which you can't craft right away, you need to go at least a couple crafting stations deep) and these jerks are [i]everywhere[/i]. Even running away from a losing battle is too difficult, since all the enemies are lightning quick no matter how big they are and chase you even more relentlessly than in Grounded, quickly climbing walls to catch up to you and taking a long time to de-aggro. Currently, combat is the worst part of this game by a [i]mile[/i] and needs a complete overhaul if this game wants any future success.
[*]Not enough resource nodes. Grass and wood are [i]everywhere,[/i] yet you can only harvest plant fiber and basic wood from certain node stalks with an upgraded tool and infrequently-seen sprouts and root clusters on the ground. Makes the gameplay loop more tedious, and is a chief reason why I think a lot of the other reviews mention they get bored easily.
[*]Base building as a whole is fairly cumbersome. You have to point your cursor at the edge of where you want walls, floors and ceilings to go, instead of a more lax 'snap' system like Rust or Grounded. There are also a lot of spots where building isn't allowed, even when it doesn't make much sense, like not being able to place foundation platforms on top of one another to make scaffolding, or on top of certain rocks. Makes building bridges over water and other gaps more troublesome than it needs to be, which wouldn't be a problem, except...
[*]...you can't swim. Falling into water kills you, and there are streams and lakes in a lot of inconvenient spots. There is also fall damage, and for a game with this level of verticality, it's pretty harsh. You get armor pieces that let you glide later on, which alleviates this, but early on this makes escaping from hostile mobs even more irritating.
[*]It's difficult to tell which mobs are hostile and which aren't. Your 'resource sensing' mode highlights all mobs as blue, even hostile ones. I think hostile mobs should be highlighted in red to more easily differentiate them, and neutral mobs in yellow or green or something.

It's a pretty game but very ""busy"", so busy in fact that they've had to put in an ""antenna mode"" which highlights which of the 20 identical rocks and blades of grass are actually harvestable resources and which are just decoration. This is bad visual design. Grounded did this same theme and didn't have to resort to a crutch like that. The business also kills any desire to base build. I don't have enough space to build anything of significance, except in certain designated areas.

Grounded also did story design better, since it's told through snippets and brief conversations, not huge information dumps by NPCs that have no voice acting like in this game. 

Progression, if it can be called that, often involves running to specific NPCs and this completely MURDERS the theming of the game to me. Tell me, why am I having to survive out here, if there's an MMORPG style network of camps and roads through this wilderness? It makes no sense. On top of that, it's a crutch. In other games in the genre, like say, Valheim, it lets you progress quite organically, only giving you an indicator of ""hey, this is an area with stuff you don't have"" but this game leads you by the nose. It gives you the exact location of an NPC who's massive dump of information is the only valuable thing there. 

The combat system is extremely basic but not polished in the slightest. The dodge roll isn't reliable at all. An ant rears up to attack, I hit the dodge roll and it's a 50/50 chance whether I'll actually dodge the attack or whether it'll zoom across the battlefield in a single frame and attack where I now am, I-frames be damned. On top of that, even slight slops in terrain are often slippery as ice.

Maybe one day, it'll be a lot better. Once it has a hell of a lot more polish but I feel like this is the kind of game that is too far along in it's development to tighten up the nuts and bolts.

[The Bad]
1) Enemy progression is very varied early on. I would like to see zones of various difficulty to let players opt in to the challenge they want.
2) Resource harvesting is very... Well it reminds me of old school 2004 Everquest. You click an interactable and then instantly there are raw materials at your feet. I would like to see animation from my character, the node I'm harvesting, and the items dropping with some physics.
3) Crafting - It's all menu-based and there is not a lot of dynamic interaction in this. The menu is a bit cookie cutter too (gradient bars, very rectangular, and the backgrounds are generic. It's giving Runescape 2009). If we're stuck in a menu to craft and repair items, I would like to see some artistry here to pull me in to that process.
4) Base Building - Walls and roofs don't mesh well unless you're building a rectangular box. I'd like to see better logic to only show the externally-visible section of walls when they clip with roofing
5) The character creator is a little bit rough and the hair could def be improved. That's usually revamped/enhanced just prior to a full release in games these days so not a big concern for me in an EA game.
6) Inventory sorting - It's 2023, having a sort button on your inventory and your storage items is basically mandatory on any sort of quality game.
7) Clipping - I have died too many times due to jumping on a large leaf or piece of plant that does not have clipping but should. When we're tiny like this in a bigger world full of giant leaves and such, everything bigger than us should be able to be jumped on, not through.

[The Good]
1) I like that there is a story and quests scattered throughout the world.
2) There is a mobile base feature that allows you to setup a special plot of land, build on it, decorate it, make it really yours. And this base can be moved magically to other little safe plots of land in the world. That's really neat and it's well done.
3) The premise and potential of the game is really exciting.
4) The game is a rough draft (though really pretty) and functionally works great. There's just a lot of quality work to be done still to enhance it.

768200,135705626,76561198012941884,0,48,906,0,89,1687833008,"Second Review: I'm having a lot more fun the second time playing this.  I  ended up playing for a lot longer this time. 

The intro is still bland but short. The map is larger and I explored more so I was able to see greater variety in the world.  

Jumping feels a bit off but the general movement doesn't feel to floaty to me now.  

I can't always tell what surface/slope my character will be able to stand on versus slide on. I wish my character could handle steeper slopes than they can currently. 

The fighting feels better than when it first released. 

I have come to love the semi-mobile base. Being able to transfer your base to whichever great tree you want to call home for a period of time is nice. Waiting on the balloon is a bit annoying still. 

I wish my character could swim, but perhaps I need to play longer to unlock some gear that lets me. 

I did unlock a better chest for storage which made me very happy. 

My only real frustration right now is the lack of unique things to find especially when you are in a part of the map where it feels like there should be a key item.. You make it to the back of a tunnel and there is nothing and/or just the  havest-able stuff you have found so many times everywhere else. You clibe a table and the same. You wave through what fells like a maze in the weeds and nothing. You follow a path to it's end and again nothing. 


First Review: Do not expect this to be Grounded 2. While yes it is a survival game, your characters are small, and bugs are your enemies or pets... the premise and game play are not the same. It will not feel like you are playing Grounded with different graphics. There will be some similarities that smack you though.

The intro is bland. It's a pretty hallway with an owl version of signs telling you how to play. It's not particularly fun to get through, but thankfully the game opens up fairly fast.

The map is decent size; especially for just entering early access. The down side is what I have explored of it so far all feels the same. There are some landmarks such as a bench, a picnic table, and a grill. (I know, it sounds familiar to Grounded players. In Smalland a forest has taken over a yard/park and in Grounded the lawn just needs mowing after a week or so.)

You'll want to set up a crafting table asap to get better weapons, craft bandages, etc. I wouldn't waste time looking for the best place to build or claiming a tree first but to each their own. You can do that part with greater ease with the right gear. 

Have a 'gather all"" option just by holding down the button longer is awesome. Wish more games did that. 

Water = Death is awful. Maybe they'll implement swimming and water materials/insects later on but that is unknown to me. Being able to swim on the surface of the water or even dive has become something I expect/appreciate. 

The controls and movement of the character feels a bit wonky at list point. The gait and jumping stick out. My character feels a tad too slow when running.

Battle...I'm not sure that blocking does much. Multiple enemies can make the screen feel like a mess. In some areas it feels like there are too many enemies when playing solo. It's not that you can't beat them, it's that fighting doesn't feel fun enough yet to want to have that many roadblocks to your exploration.  It's possible I just need to ""get better"". Time will tell. If you need/want to run it can take a while to lose your pursuers. 

The stamina bar is rather small. If that is upgrade-able then I don't mind it starting off small.

The storage chests are really, really small. I'm hoping I unlock a better version soon as the amount of boxes I would need to play the way I usually play games like these will be insane. 

Building in the game is fairly friendly. A little fussy here and there but far better than several games I've played. I'm trying to figure out the limits on building integrity. I wonder if better materials will let me build higher/further.

I'll be playing more. I can't recommend it yet as while I'm interested, my fun level is on the low side. I think it is a good start for an early access game.",1680128214,1687902302,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Conclusion so far: Eh... It's better than it was, but it has a way to go still. But then the Developers have made it clear they're planning to make that effort. 

It took me this long to get to that because I had a serious motivation problem due to people constantly making posts saying that I was just complaining that the game was too hard (which, really, I'm not. I mean, FFS the game lets you tweak the difficulty of your world. It even has a peaceful mode where creatures are completely passive until you attack them first. If my problem with the issues I identified were 'it's too haaaaard' I'd just turn that on). 
To the point that I started deleting comments that said nothing but that and started delaying playing the game to update my review, because I did not want there to be even a 0.0001% chance that some twerp telling me to 'git gud' believed they'd successfully bullied me into changing my review to positive if it turned out that the issues were fixed.

But then I realised that that isn't fair to the developers and, really, isn't letting them get to me like that just a different way of letting them win?

So... Yeah, here's the review edited for the current state of the game.[/i]

I would avoid this for now.

A lot of the positive reviews for Smalland talk about its potential and they're correct in that the game has a lot of potential to be really good in the future. But future potential is not the same as current reality.

As it stands, the game's map is very large and there's a lot to explore... But a large part of that size lies in verticality. The map is obviously designed from the point of view that as you progress you unlock mobility tools (there's armour pieces with wings that let you glide, a grappling hook and presumably the eventual option to tame flying mounts). Unfortunately, those mobility tools are both essential to making getting around the map less of a slog... And completely unavailable right at the start of the game. 
Which means that for most of the early game, you have to get around by running everywhere.

And running everywhere highlights several other problems:
- There are way too many aggressive insects and once they aggro, they will follow you ridiculous distances. The only way to disengage from an insect that has decided it wants to attack you is to sprint away and it often takes between almost a full bar of stamina to [i]over[/i] a full bar of stamina to get far enough where they will stop chasing. 
[b]This is still the case. The chase range still feels quite a bit too high.[/b]
- Even when you eventually get good enough gear to where you no longer have to run from the swarms of various species of Ants that litter the map, the combat system is bad enough that even if you have weapon that kills them in two or three hits, they will also hit you a bunch of times as you take them down. Which means that you're constantly drained of healing items and weapon/armour durability just getting from where you decided to build you base to where you want to explore or gather resources. And while these ants provide some useful starting foods, they don't provide anything else, so you're not exactly getting much in return for the resources you're wasting having to fight them just to navigate the map. 
[b]The parry mechanic has somewhat improved this. While it's not actually that effective against the ants I'm talking about in this point (since those are individually weak, but drain your resources because they swarm you so that you can't dodge or block one of them without opening yourself up to an attack from one of the others), those ants aren't a real threat anyway. It works wonders against the various Beetles, Gekkos and solitary Spiders you might run into.[/b]
- The inventory is ridiculously small. Another negative review pointed out that this game requires a lot of grinding. This is largely due to inventory size. Resources stack up to a maximum of 30 (and many 'products', like cooked food or healing items, have a stack size that's smaller than that) and the toolbar is not a separate inventory. So... Each and every tool, healing item and food item you're carrying with you (with the exception of whatever tool you currently have in hand) takes up an inventory slot. And not only do different resources require different tools, but different enemies have different weaknesses that require different weapons and if you don't use the most efficient weapon for a given enemy, it takes a lot longer to kill them, which costs more durability on your weapons and armour and more healing items to keep yourself alive. All of this stuff you have to carry with you when you leave your base, so even if you stick to carrying solely the essentials for your journey and leave everything else in a (couple of) chest(s) in your base, your inventory will already be between a quarter and a third full.
[b]The realisation I had as I was playing the game again is that in addition to all the tools and healing you have to carry, the inventory feels small because in gathering the resource you need, your inventory will also constantly get clogged up with resources that you don't need (or don't need as many of. This isn't an issue exclusive to Smalland, lots of similar survival builders have this, but that doesn't make it less of an issue, particularly when combined with the other factors.[/b]
- {i[I'm condensing the bullet points on tames into one point, since that is the area that the developers seem most focused on in the future and it's what's most likely to drastically change over future patches. With the latest patch, tames are more durable and being able to have more than one tame waiting at your base is a huge boon. This is a good development. But (You knew there was going to be a 'but', didn't you?) the way that switching your active pet works does still have some QoL issues. You can very easily and cheaply craft a pet whistle that lets you call your active pet to you no matter where it is on the map and it will sorta teleport to you. But in order to switch your active pet, you have to go up to your current pet, tell it to stop being your active pet, then go to the pet that you want active and tell it to become active.  Logically this makes sense... 
But in pure gameplay terms it means that if you want to go somewhere to gather a lot of resources with a ladybug, you'll have to go there on foot. And if you don't want to risk it getting killed by the hostiles you'll be passing on the way back to base, you'll still have to leave the ladybug out in the open somewhere and hope it doesn't get killed by randomly wandering hostiles instead. Tamed pets have double the hp of their untamed counterparts, but for a ladybug that's still not a lot of health.

In closing, Smalland has a lot of potential. but most of that potential lies in what the developers [b]can[/b] do with the world they've built and it remains to be see whether they [b]will[/b] do those things or not.

However... They're really showing promise. 

If you don't think any of what I've pointed out sounds like a problem, I can recommend Smalland for you. 

If you do think it's a problem, I can't recommend getting it for now, but I [i]can[/i] finally recommend keeping an eye on the game, because I'm confident that the developers are dedicated to improving these aspects as much as they can. (And the only reason I don't recommend getting it now, despite my confidence that the developers want to improve it is that early access always has an element of uncertainty and while I fervently hope that the developers don't run into issues that leave them unable to get the game to its ideal state, I can't guarantee that and I would be steering people wrong if I acted like I could).",1685306216,1687895912,False,359,18,0.827123045921325684,32,True,False,True

The trailer showcases mounts and wings and some really cool armor, and I was stoked for that. However, I found the actual gameplay and progression to be lacking. Along with some other problems, It just didn't seem to be worth the $25 price tag.

Combat:
Combat feels good with some early enemies, however a lot of enemies such as beetles or wolf spiders barely have attack animations. You're relying on audio queues for attacks, which would be passable if this wasn't the only issue. Parrying feels so good and can be kind of generous sometimes. However, it feels like enemies attack patterns are pretty random and because of the lack of visual tells it feels like you're just spamming the block button and praying you parry. Rolling is another option that at first felt great. However, I would compare its effectiveness to the rolling in a game like dark souls 2. Feels inconsistent and sometimes you just get hit by some bull. You're stamina is pretty low too so it feels almost always better to try and parry in most situations. What is by far my biggest issue, impacted by a lot of the other issues listed above, is the way the bugs relentlessly hunt you down in packs. While I believe you can adjust spawnrate and an option to make them passive unless provoked, I wanted to play the game as intended. I have no issues with enemies being aggressive, but it is impossible not to aggro some bugs, and almost EVERY bug is faster than you. Jank hitboxes make it so even if you sprint away or roll you can still get hit. This makes getting your stuff back feel like a slog unless your bed is really close by. I was building beds everytime I went to a new area and there were times I still felt like I could barely get my stuff back. Respawing with half your health is ludicrous, so by the time you get your stuff you have like 20 HP left, if even. 

Sound:
Music is good, helped build some atmosphere but pretty standard for a fantasy type game. I was drawn in by all the skittering sounds in the first tunnel/cave you spawn in. However it feels sort of downhill from there. Some bugs are way too loud and it makes it borderline annoying. And if you get to low health, (which is often especially early) the sound is super dulled and you have to deal with a drumming heartbeat sound until you heal. Remember what I said about listening to audio queues to parry? Good luck doing that on low health.

Crafting/Survival:
Hunger/Nourishment is really easy to sustain and I have no problems with it. The game gives you plenty of food. Early game weapons seemed relatively balanced to craft. The problem here lies with armor, healing, and mobility. The armor (at least early game, maybe this changes later) can only be crafted by certain NPCs. While I think it's cool to unlock armor from them, not being able to craft it as you explore feels terrible and leaves you unprepared or needing to backtrack. As for healing, I was fortunate to kill a lot of bees early and that and crafting healing a lot less expensive, but because of the swarms of enemies, I was forced to constantly use healing items. 

Exploration: 
Having only three plus hours, I didn't get to explore a ton of the world, but not because I wasn't trying. Early game exploration feels slow and tedious. Instantly drowning from water makes it feel impossible to cross a stream unless there are lily pads, so I had to take some long routes around. Any mobility options don't unlock until later or with specfic NPCs, so getting there feels ridiculously grindy. This makes exploration feel like you're designated to go to certain areas first instead of exploring at your pace, which defeats the purpose of an open world. 

Overall, I love the concept of the game, it does get some things right, and (like a lot of other reviews) I'll say it has A LOT of potential. However, even getting it on the 20% sale didn't feel worth it. I didn't want to grind a frustrating early game to experience the possible fun the mid to late game had to offer.

However, there's no shield to craft and blocking does very little, while costing a lot of stamina relative to attacks.  You can't cancel the slow attack animation to block.  Dodge rolling only works sometimes and is also expensive to do.  You can either be defensive and do little damage or be fully offensive due to stamina costs.  The most successful battles were just swinging wildly, running in a circle around the enemy, and hoping for the best.  Ranged with a bow was not terribly effective to even use.  Combat stamina needs a huge balance pass.

I'm also not a fan that water is instant death. You ghostly pass through the non-interactable grass.  The ""resource search"" mode doesn't show pick up items like fiber and wood.  Dropped items can fall into some collision-less objects making them impossible to reach; like mushroom parts fall into the mushroom stump and can't be interacted.

The game is pretty polished and has a lot to love about the graphics, presentation and overall polish of the gameplay but I am getting pretty irritated with the progression.  A lot of the early game..Honestly most of it is spent having to continuously manage inventory space that just fills up so damn fast with useless crap.

The cost of building is fine, but I find that halving or cutting the returns for demoing walls and things to be incredibly annoying anytime I'm trying to build, I constantly have to go grind out resources while getting slapped by enemies I can't really do much about other than run or left click till dead.  You could try to block with the club(you'll be out of stamina) or dodge(you'll be out of stamina) but then you're still gonna get hit when that's done with.  I don't know, there needs to be some tuning here I feel like, it's not hard I mostly just find it annoying.

Bandages should just be craftable out of your inventory.  I do drop crafting stations wherever I end up needing to but then..oh boy more slapping trees and s**t vs exploring the cool as hell world.  Great.

I don't know, maybe that all resolves with time or something, I have 6 hours in game and I feel like progression with items is snail's pacing.  I hope they take a page out of valheim's book and make the resources and costs less annoying and more something to engaged with.  Setting up a mining quarry and building various structures was just way more fun in valheim, here it really is much less enjoyable because it feels like pestering vs me wanting to build something.",1687148978,1687148978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Things i think they should change or adjust:
That antenna vision, it blinds the hell out of me, i hope they change this, to a more darker color like in Assassins creed e.g. current state of that is not pleasent for the eyes.

the option to relocate the input button for escape/pause menu, cause i play on a minikeyboard, where i have to hold FN key and escape, but this is more a personal preference and a fail purchase on my side. But would make it easier for people with mini keyboards.

The graphics and UI are outdated and reminiscent of something from the early 2000's. If you can see since the forest is so dark and even on Ultra settings, the forest seems fuzzy and breaks immersion instead of being magical and wondrous. UI buttons don't work. You're forced to use a ""resource nightvision"" to concern what is actually interactable. There are loads of opportunity to learn from what Grounded does great at.

These flaws aren't that big of a deal if the gameplay makes up for it, but the gameplay does not. Combat is rudimentary and punishing. Enemies will camp your tombstone. I had to fight a group of ~5 ants repeatedly to try and get my gear, which of course meant I never got my gear back. You may kill one, but by the time you respawn and run back (some reason only retaining 50% of your health), you can be assured that another enemy has taken its place. I can only assume the rest of the game will repeat this design flaw, which gives me no motivation to actually play it.

At least give us a little while after logging in to gather resources and learn the building system before throwing us unavoidable death mechanics. Even Valheim didn't send me a rainstorm for the first few in-game days and you don't even die getting caught in them. You can't evade attacks despite having an evasive ability. It doesn't do what you think it does. I used evade as an ant tried to hit me and it still hit even though I was not in front of it anymore. Hits are preordained from the start of the attack and not at the end and I think mobs have autolock. If they don't, somehow the combat system works like they do.

Pros:
-Good visual design, the world is cohesive and plays well to it's themes.
-Good level of enemy variety.
-Most boss fights feel very skill based, with windows to get in a few hits after dodging their attacks.
-Great Tree base system is a very nice way to limit the downsides of having to trek over all the map to get to and from your base.
-Good variety of weapons and armour, with different focuses for each.
-Map definitely opens up as you gain extra traversal options, especially gliding armour.

Cons:
-Fighting standard creatures can be frustrating at points, if they start to attack back while you are in the middle of an swing you often can't take any defensive measure because you are animation locked till your attack is finished.
-High stamina cost on the dodge move can leave very few defensive options when attacked by more than one enemy, you end up just trying to hack through them before they hack through you.
-Petty, but the scrolling in the codex is incredibly slow.
-Something seems to be up with the graphics optimisation, first game since I built my current PC I've had to turn down from Ultra, still ran fine and looked good on high though.


Changes I would like to see:
-Add hit stun for non-boss creatures letting you get a full combo of 3-4 hits before they gain a brief immunity to stagger, this would alleviate the problems of fighting groups of weaker enemies and standard enemies attacking through your hits not giving you any defensive play.
-A craftable single use item to quick travel back to your spawn point, maybe a mini-balloon or some such. Whilst trekking to far flung parts of the map for resources can be fun, the return journey is generally less entertaining.

Notes:
-I didn't actually use the taming/mount system at all, It never felt necessary and I was having plenty of fun on foot. I also rarely use mounts in games, so that is mostly personal taste.
-Kept forgetting to make the grapple gun, so can confirm you can easily get through the game without it.
-I played standard settings, but with all loot kept on death, so I could use cliffs and water to teleport back to base. Only actually died twice in normal play.

1. Smallands is a lot bigger than grounded in map size, but grounded makes you feels smaller due to actually being smaller.
2. Grounded has been being fleshed out for 3+ years now, and Smallands is less than half a year old. Given time, it will grow but it is a lot less content as of writing this.
3. Smallands has tames/mounts and ACTUAL gliding, not the dandelion tuft-bullshit grounded has.
4. Base building is extremely different, but Smallands lacks a lot of decoration pieces, but you can build a LOT more freely than in Grounded. Also, you can build in the great trees and move that base to another great tree by talking to a gnome statue.
5. Smallands has character customization and a much higher player limit of 10, so you can get more friends together than in Grounded.

Gameplay/combat is clunky. There is a second of cooldown after every action so you can't really attack and dodge, there is no way of not taking damage, everything feels slow and unresponsive.
Even on lowest settings there are constant stutters, short freezes whenever you pick something up. Horrible performance.
When you finally tame something it instantly gets demolished by enemies, and if you accidentally damage your pet it starts attacking you.
Inventory system is a mess. Hotbar items stay in the actual inventory grid so it becomes very confusing to organize. Add to that, if you are holding an item it disappears from the inventory grid, so double the confusion. How do you make such bad design decisions?
Right click to transfer everything instead of the standard shift-click, no sort buttons, crafting feels like filling out a survey, already placed workbenches get new recipes as you collect new resources so it's very easy to miss an item you could have crafted (just make them greyed-out/locked..), etc etc. The list goes on.
Feels like the devs never even touched a survival game before and just wanted to get in on the small person in a garden train.

-The number of aggressive creatures/density of them is too high
-The tracking on the enemies attacks are absurd, I can understand tracking on higher end enemies, but if you give us a dodge roll mechanic then you should make the attacks consistently dodge-able 
-In relation to the last point, the enemies hit boxes are huge while the players hit boxes are seemingly accurate to the model (enemies can hit you in the air even if you've jumped over them causing you to effectively be hit by air somehow) if you're going to be ridiculously brutal on the players for aim then give the enemies the same treatment, otherwise make them as easy to hit as we are.
-There's a huge lack of direction in the game as is, you basically need to look things up in order to find them without losing your mind being swarmed by 60 ants, 10 beetles, 4 dragonflies, 2 geckos, and a cockroach just to find the next tier up from wood, a simple solution to that would be adding several tiers of weapons and armor, like stone weapons and chitin armor.
-BEES SHOULD NOT BE HOSTILE, if you have wasps sure, BUT NOT BEES

Now a couple of suggestions

-It may already be in the works, but a proper quest journal that gets updated and the like and helps guide the player would be great
-A nice way to help with the balance of the game, (and something that is in a lot of survival games that I'm surprised isn't in this one), is a way to upgrade/level-up your combat abilities, use a weapon a lot? It does more damage/higher crit chance/higher crit damage/less damage done with a block/less stamina used when swinging or aiming/bow charges faster/etc. the list for things it could improve goes on and on and would help players increase their strength before going into these areas that they're otherwise woefully ill-equipped to enter the first time around (like getting flint on the beach)",1686801792,1686801792,True,2,0,0.519650638103485107,0,True,False,True

I purchased this as many people compered this to Valheim (I'm a big fan) but if you think of buying this based on the same premise. Don't! Save yourself the money and time!

Pros:
- nice looking gear, the armour looks nice, I'm a fool for nice cosmetics.

Cons:
- Combat (deal breaker) - combat is quick, all enemies move quick, quicker than you. There is a block mechanic but it is worthless, you still take dmg when blocking. You can dodge but considering the speed of the enemies, when you dodge and attack, they just move away from you (so annoying, it's unreasonable).
- Farming - Takes super long to farm, not only do you have to run to a specific area to farm something (reasonable), takes super long to run somewhere, tools break like crazy. I often found myself only running from point A to B as any interaction in between will mess up your plan.
- Darkness of the game - I had brightness maxed out and during nights it was still dark as hell. Could not see enemies if they had no glowing eyes.
- Building - not engaging at all. All pieces look like they were added for the sake of having something to build. Paper made like.
- You can't swim but there is a lake you need to cross, across the whole map.
- Inventory management - You can assign weapons to different slots 1-9 for easy access. When changing weapons, for example; from sword to mace, it shuffles the weapons in your inventory. It drove me crazy that I could not keep my inventory in order.
- Dodgy multiplayer - I could build and craft a lot more than my wife. Not sure why, we played every minute together.
- Taming pets - In my 9hr adventure, I tamed a ""ladybug"", it would carry your inventory, like an extra bag. Sounds great when it works, after like 3rd, maybe 4th time I summoned it, it didn't come. 60 silk went to cra* because of it. Strengthens my point regarding farming and weak tools.

Smalland: Survive the Wilds is a game developed and published by Merge Games

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out. The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all

Smalland: Survive the Wilds overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good open-world survival adventure game to play!

If you like to run around, collect stuff, explore, get lost, fall off stuff, find ways to climb up stuff, unlock recipes, find randos on the map, build bridges, build tree forts, and that sort of thing, then you will enjoy wasting time in this game with peaceful server mode enabled. If you like salt, turn off peaceful mode and see how that feels for a bit. I especially recommend pitching yourself down below the church ruins in that mode to really feel that salt. I'm honestly very glad they enabled peaceful server mode. I would not have enjoyed, nor played the game, had they not done that. Not really into salt. But I am into wandering around and figuring stuff out and getting lost. Getting lost is the best when the game rewards you for it (and it mostly does, albeit a bit late in chapter 1).

The controls, building mechanics, etc. are all intuitive if you've played other builders, but like most other builders, the snap mechanics are terrible. The devs at least tried to give you some control over this to help, so I appreciate that. I think snap mechanics in general are just difficult to code, so I get it. I hope the developers introduce curved stairs soon. It's a royal pain to build a round tower right now because you have to build stairs out of corner pieces. Sideways rotation is interesting and makes it fun to build things. Some things, like support beams, do not rotate sideways though. I hope they change that.

It's early access, so the gear and mob balancing needs work. I had to turn my settings way down to get past most of the bosses, but I kept it high enough that for me, it was still a challenging enough fight to enjoy it. All of the server settings they've surfaced have been carefully thought out and added value to my free-wandering gaming experience. The developers seem to be flooded with bug reports and requests for the moment, but they also seem to be responsive to them. The game isn't abandoned in the least. The final vendor makes gear that has really low sturdiness. The cold balancer seems totally off, or only buys endurance to cold in time, not full resistance, but there are workarounds. The swamp witch makes gear that gives 0.166666664884 or whatever health. Silly things like that, but they're not deal breakers. The game is not meant to be overly harsh or salty from what I can see, so once they get the balancing down, I think the rest is QOL.

Bugs aside, the game is really fun to me and I recommend it to people who enjoy games where they can wander around for ages. The game never crashed on me and the graphics sizes and audio have been stable. Early on it had some loot bugs that have been resolved (including tree transfer loot bugs). The environments are gorgeous. Some other games I've enjoyed in a similar way: WoW (I have the original Explorer title), Skyrim, Dysmantle, Satisfactory, Valheim. If you liked wandering around almost aimlessly in any of those or building for giggles, you might like this game on peaceful mode.

Overall, the settings and motion choices they made available do help keep my motion sensitivities to a minimum, and nothing too crazy like bouncing when running or bouncing when chopping trees to flare it up. I do wish I could zoom out a little more from my character to help with camera follow speed dizziness, but it's not the worst. I can mostly glide around just fine, too, but I have to pace it or I end up spinning a bit.

Pros:

Doesn't feel like Grounded at all. It adds some things Grounded doesn't have such as portable bases in the form of Great Trees. Basically it allows you to move your entire bases across a decent amount of points on the map. Tamable critters, gliding (via armor), and flying (by mount). All 3 have their limitations and most end up feeling disappointing. The armor gliding though is near perfect. I use that as my primary way to travel.

Instead of Cons since I presume a lot will change according to the road map I may end up regurgitating some recommended improvements.

Need to Improve:

1) Combat system: It's okay but its bad. Some fine tuning on stamina drain on block/dodge is needed. You can barley manage to go any fight without taking damage and none of the fights feel good. Also would like to see shields and parry added. The way to fight right now seems to be attack, dodge, run around, repeat. 

2) Tames: Taming isn't as big of an issue as the tames themselves. I'm sure the Devs have heard this, I hope they find a way to fix this. The FOV when riding is doable but its bad. If some how they made ARK level tames in this... probably wishful thinking here. Buffs and utility is needed for the tames. FOV change is welcomed it feels too close. I'd also like to see having more than 1 tame at a time. If not of the same critter which I could see being too OP for the State of the game but 1 of each please.

Ladybug:  Health/Resistance buff needed. This is my #1 favorite tame just for the extra inventory, but because it dies so easily I have to make it not follow and use the whistle when I need it. Since it likes to run away like a coward and often gets stuck and dies. Perhaps give it the ability to fly away from dangers. 

Grasshopper: I don't get this bug, I'd rather walk, seriously. If jumping distance is the idea maybe have charge leap ability and set that to determine how much distance/stamina you gain/lose as result. The leap distance and nearly complete stamina drain makes it not worth it. What would make this bug really stand out is the leap ability with a glide. 

Gecko: This guy seems okay at the level of progression. I'd like to see massive speed boost and maybe consider allowing him to scale vertical walls. Damage is fine, I feel like it should be more of a ground travel mount.

Wolf Spider: This guy is disappointing. The only thing going for this is ability to attack while riding. This guy needs a damage boost and ability to scale walls. The mount speed is good and if left alone would make Gecko more appealing as a traveler. 

I haven't tried the few other mounts left over so no comment on those. All of the tamables for sure need health/resistance buffs. They are too weak. Both the Gecko and Spider need dramatic heals after every fight against mid level+ bugs. IE. Water bugs, green beetles, wasps, etc.

3) Potions: I finally got around to making these and some are useful but man the time it takes to consume them especially health potions is too long. I hope you guys are considering time it takes to consume these items. The bandages are fine and are my go to for heals. 

4) Quality of Life: We need auto sort badly, as well as storage labels. I would like to see auto sort buttons in both character inventory and storage boxes. Claimed Great Trees should be viewable on the map not just the one you are occupying. A way to distinguish them could be through different icon colors. Trail markers for ground level base locations. 

5) Progression: The Progression feels pretty good. My complaint though has to do with the items. As we gain access to better tools and weapons, I expected bigger jumps in this. The damage improved from wood - flint - chitin - metal felt too marginal. Also the durability, please fix this. It feels like the weapons/tools are being damaged at the same rate upon use. It's very noticeable when you are cheap like me building workshops every where just to repair after a few uses for free. The only difference I notice is the rate which you get your harvest due to the extra damage from better tools. A 450 durability Iron Pick Axe degrades as fast as a 450 durability metal pick axe. Might already be in the works but I hope to see item upgrades have equal opportunity. Chitin Hatchen and Spear... but then we get 3 Iron slash damage weapons?

Map Size: I don't know the exact details. The world looks big but as you travel it you'd be surprised how far you can go in a short amount of time. It feels on par with Grounded. There does not seem to be any depth to the upper level of the map. All it really seems to be is just building on top of Great Trees. Most of the activity in the game takes place at the ground level.

For anyone with high hopes in this game, it might not be worth it for you right now. I'm not sure how the cost to game play ratio will turn out for me in this. For me this game was worth the cost but I don't expect it at its current state to meet the same cost to game play ratio as I got with Grounded. Hope to see this game grow and change for the better.

There is a lot of detail and thought that has gone into making the player really feel tiny and it gives off a real Borrowers kind of vibe which I absolutely adore. 
The bugs and geckos in this game are truly terrifying and they change between daytime and nighttime. Random thunderstorms and changing seasons also add to the stress and make it so that the player has to plan to go on an expedition properly. Adding to the fun of the game!. 

It can be played solo, with friends, online, and offline. I have however not played with anyone else so I'm not able to comment on this.

This game is in early access so there are a couple of unpolished aspects that are to be noted and I feel that once they are addressed, this game will become one of my absolute favorite games to play. 

Some of these things I have noticed are: 

- Moving about in this game feels a bit clunky in some places, I keep falling through the earth or running into invisible walls. 

-The AI for the pets/companions is annoying, the lady beetle that carries your items randomly runs off..

-The creatures that are rideable are annoying to maneuver and get stuck on the terrain a lot

-Some of the features of having a pet just don't work. The gecko for example is supposed to run up walls but doesn't really do any better at it than the grasshopper. 

-Both the gecko and grasshopper lose their ability to attack once they are tamed

-There is no friendly fire so if you hit your pet, they die and they have very little health or way to boost their armor and they get stuck in the terrain easily.  

I will update this as time goes on and as the game gets better. These are really just teething issues and while some of it is a bit annoying, the game is still fun and enjoyable to play. 

I do recommend this game to those with an open mind and not too put off by 'bugs' (sorry for the pun! lol)

I found this game because I had a blast playing Grounded, until the... ick factor of the game sunk in. I played a while in it, but I didn't ever get far because everything was just... really gross. Insects exploded into ooze before fading tastefully away, items and even armor made out of insect parts still looked very gristly, and even cooked food that I enjoyed hunting for (although I didn't like looking at it when I killed it) didn't... look like FOOD. It looked like zapped bug. No matter how much the characters insisted it tasted good, I couldn't stomach playing that game for very long, which I totally understand is a personal thing and I'm still glad I got it. 
I instantly bought this game because I had a fantasy of riding on a damselfly and leading an army of hornets, something similar I like to do in ARK: survival evolved with the flying creatures; leading a bunch of stronger ones and riding an agile tapejara. When I realized you could only tame one creature I was a bit hesitant, but I seriously think that plays to your favor. I think having multiple slots for creatures would be a great addition but it's still great because you never feel helpless. The game is built around empowering the player, not the army the player amasses; I never had the patience for stat breeding in Ark and I'm so glad taming is fairly easy and straightforward. I had a blast traveling with my ladybug (before she died) and riding my grasshopper (before they died) and am looking forwards to a long and lasting relationship with the gecko I plan to get!
Honestly that's the other thing: This game feels like YOU are in control. In some games it feels like you're only as good as your gear; if you have a netherite sword and armor with the right enchantments you've beaten Minecraft; not much can hurt you. If you have the riot gear in Ark you're still a squishy little human and the game wants to grind your bones into mud for presuming you can survive on your own. In both situations, on both sides of the scale, I feel like there's no point upgrading because I either get stomped either way or would rather not be forever invincible. In this game, armors have strengths, and more importantly they have DISADVANTAGES. Some are warm and good for winter but don't protect as much; some are heavily protective but it's harder to dodge attacks; even the weapons are a match up against the wildlife, and if you decide you're a sword person you won't be having as good at time as if you flick through weapon types as needed.

Like, it's one of the hardest games I've ever played, and that's not a good thing.

Games that are hard, usually have a reward that makes dying over and over again worth it in the end.

However, this game, does not. It's run out of your newly built house, smell the roses, go gather some resour- oop! Aggro! Die. Okay, no worries. Just go grab your stuff, and try again. Leave your house, head to your body, get attacked by every creature on the way there, die. Okay, still not a big deal, we can make it through this. Leave your house, head to your first death again, oh wait what's that noise? A storm?! Now you're freezing to death... die.

You see the problem here?

In a game where the goal is steady progression and unlocking new crafting recipes, having EVERY, SINGLE, BUG, aggro you is ******* STUPID! Like, it's overwhelming. I can't deal with it.

I do NOT recommend this game. Don't buy it, save yourself the frustration and headaches.

Trust me.

Signe-
die.
(I died walking to my pen and paper to sign this review)

Edit: In response to the developers response, I found out about the settings you're referring to a few days after this review was written. However, that is not a solution to the problem. First off, your solution of turning on peaceful mode just makes EVERY bug non-hostile until they're hit. I don't want that. I don't want spiders to be peaceful. That isn't how this is supposed to work. I shouldn't have to consciously choose an option that makes the games ridiculously easy. The default gameplay should just be tuned better.

What you need to do is make certain bugs inherently hostile on sight. Eg. Red ants, spiders, black soldier ants. Why are the worker ants hostile?!? 

I hope this clarified what I was talking about above in my original review.",1685605001,1686319966,False,4,1,0.50771564245223999,0,True,False,True

I bought this game on launch and was hyped but more i play it feels just like grounded is much better? I mean sure if you don't like the grounded art style i get that but it's quality and polish are far higher in general.

Grounded has the sense of progression with the tons of skills you can unlock and equip, proper armour sets with perks on them etc, smalland has the cool (base can go to any server with you) which i really like the idea of and wish grounded had but outside of that it's just a 5 year old copy?

A few things I would like to see fixed or added:
- better control support. For example when ever I go into a menu or my map my mouse cursor is just floating in the middle of the screen, or when i go to settings I have to use the keyboard mouse to navigate.
- I wish I could build using materials in nearby storage.
- I would like a reorganize option for inventory.
- Make things easier to pick up like spider web and eggs. Maybe highlight the item when in position to grab.
- Fix my Doors disappearing every time I die or reload the game.
And one thing I liked in Grounded that would be awesome here was the statues for unused armor and displays for weapons. I even liked being able to make stuffed bugs. (I had mad a whole bug scene in my trophy room of my building.)

The game has some major problems right now with a few things.
1. The combat feels like a cheap replica of conan exiles, and thats a bad thing. The enemies patterns/reacitions all feel so awkward that it feels unreasonable sometimes to even get a swing in without getting hit, or its just hit/roll/hit/roll in an extremely tedious combo. I don't understand the point of dodge-roll mechanics in a game with such questionable enemy movement/hitboxes.

2. The game could benefit from a perk or other type of progression system as right now it doesn't feel like your progress much as a character.

3. Weapons break way too fast considering how packed the map is with enemies, who many times are faster than you, and so you end up forced into alot of fights or take damage. I know this is supposed to be offset by the fact you'll need to carry 3 weapons as matching enemy damage resistances/vulnerabilities is very important, but slashing is the most common, bludgeoning is almost always for beetle-types and piercing for flying, with some random exceptions here and there.

4. The vulnerabilities system seems neat, but i feel like its also to cover up the fact that the weapons are all  the same without much difference beyond the animations look different, but functionally its all for show.

5. Blocking is effectively not a thing as best i can tell there's no shields, and blocking still has you take almost full damage from an attack while still depleting stamina. 

6. Armor being unable to be crafted by yourself seems such an odd choice. You can make weapons, but armor requires you to effectively look stuff up ahead of time; because otherwise the expectation is you get there, sigh when you see the requirements, and then run back to gather them. Or you do something more reasonable and look them up, prep the materials, and then make the trek over.
It also means certain early game armors are a waste of time.
If they taught you a recipe that you could bring home that would be another thing; but instead its just generally bad.


I wanted to give it a positive review, but the game has been generally unpleasant so far. If the combat gets more responsive and less janky/floaty it would go miles for it. Instead i just found myself disliking the combat and slowly being more disappointed by the progression. It made me just dread going out to gather materials/fight things and thus made exploring the map feel all the worse.

I won't fault the game too much for lacking a perk/leveling system; i just personally dislike it when games make you 100% tied to your gear; but in itself its one of the few things that made conan exiles feel ok just because you'd eventually have a build that could deal with the awful combat of that game; here you're just kinda stuck with it.",1685475794,1685475794,False,1,1,0.511677324771881104,0,True,False,True

The game at full release state probably will be pretty good.  Don't expect too much on early access...either wait or play now while keeping in mind what I said.

You have zero right to ""complain"" on an early release state of game. You  knew what you were getting into.

This game has NO BUSINESS being this good. 

At first my hopes and expectations were very low, as most titles that release early access these days are awful. So I logged into my own little world, expecting to see the same enemies over and over again, possibly a repetitive map. And I was like ""wow, this is pretty challenging, I'm getting my ass kicked..."" It felt a lot like playing ark for the first time. Death: everywhere. So I started to get a little mad, and decided I was going to jump to the bee armor so I could glide past enemies. Welp... That's where I got sucked in. You need better weapons to beat the harder enemies that give you better armor. Standard for sure, but the execution here is flawless. You do NOT want to sneak into the swamp and try to steal silk until you are properly prepared. Push comes to shove, I start grinding. Real hard. Several hours of hard work, and then BAM, I'm gliding around the map. Has the game peaked here? Nope. Then you get your catapult. Dear God. The smile on my face as I LAUNCH myself all over the map. And now I have what I think are the best weapons in the game. But what's this? There's a building in the distance. I glide over to it, battle my way through it, bam, legendary recipe for an even BETTER weapon. Get. Out. Of. Here. 

Man, this game got me. Easily the best early access release to date. Grounded can eat it's heart out. Very excited to see where this game goes. *applause*",1684116092,1684116092,True,1,0,0.505833923816680908,0,True,False,True

Also the tree base thing is fantastic - be wary of multiple people claiming trees on co-op for now tho / make sure to only have the host claim the tree. Otherwise your friend logs off and whoops bye bye base. 

For early access this is an amazing game. Combat isn’t clean, but it works. Each new tier of weapon feels much stronger than it’s predecessor. The armors are fun - although ideally they could put in a mechanic to craft them at base once unlocked.

Would recommend turning on “keep items on death”, reducing fall damage to the minimum, and tweaking the hunger rate mechanic to have the most fun. Don’t worry, you’ll still get to die plenty of times. Especially early game.",1684115495,1684115495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To be honest, right now, it's clunky; inventory management is non-standard, dropping stuff, transferring to other chests uses different keybinds and these are not editable as of yet. Really breaks all my muscle memory and is often frustrating. 

Additionally, resource gathering is not super fun. So far I didn't see there being any form of farming, which means you gotta go to specific places to get the resources you need. You can't plant trees to get wood or other resources you need nearby. 

Plus, you can't shape the world around you like you can in Valheim, there's no digging or erecting foundations.

Some people compare this game to Valheim and the comparison is somewhat valid. Progression and base building are very similar, if not identical. Combat is centered around dodging and blocking, there's no parry mechanic. Food doesn't give you health/stamina buffs, since there's a hunger/thirst bar. Food doesn't spoil, which is nice. Tools, armor and weapons can be repaired for free if they're not damaged too much. After a certain threshold you need some resources to fix them. Inventory is only slot restricted, items don't have weight. The game has RPG-like paper doll UI where items like tools, weapons and armor have to be equipped, unlike in Valheim where equipped items are still held in the inventory. This creates a slightly annoying issue I'll get back to later.
Graphics and sound design are very respectable. Few issues with audio occlusion when you're in a player-made building, but nothing game breaking. Performance is really solid. I was getting +100 fps, locked 120 average, 1080p High without any FSR/DLSS on a 3070. All key mappings can be rebound, there's a FOV slider and all the jazz you'd expect from a PC game. Very good.

If you're not a big fan of spiders, there's an arachnophobia slider. At max value, the spiders' legs are not visible. But that's it.

Anyways, off to the specifics:

Combat:
- You can't parry and there's no shield item which is weird because the game does support having two tools equipped at once, sooooo...?
- Most encounters boil down to everyone's favorite mini-game of bar management, where you seemingly never have enough stamina to block/dodge and attack in time. Later in the game you meet enemies that apply poison DoT which pauses stamina regen for half a second each time you take damage, so the fights drag out even longer. There's stamina potions but I always forgot to use them, no idea if they're any help.
- There's very aggressive input buffering/queuing, whatever you want to call it. Basically you can hold down LMB to keep attacking or using your tool instead of clicking. The problem is, if you don't let go of LMB right before the next swing, you've queued up another swing. This can make combat a bit unresponsive as your character does swings you didn't really want them to and you lose stamina.
- Weapons have different damage types and enemies have weaknesses and resistances, but despite that I often found out that just spamming sword/axe is the best tactic.
- Weapons, tools and armors have tiered upgrades. There are resources that require a tool of a certain tier to be gathered and this part works mostly as you'd expect. As far as weapons and armors go, I often didn't notice any difference when going from Tier X to Tier X+1. If you skip one tier, then the difference becomes noticeable.

Exploration:
- Your character feels very slow, even when sprinting. Mounts can help with that tho.
- The game's scale contributes to a feeling that you're not really making any progress, since most of the map looks very same-y (I got the same vibe from Grounded). In other games you can almost always notice how the scenery changes when you advance from one biome to another.
- Your character can't swim so early on you're gonna have to get creative to get past certain obstacles. Later on you can tame a bug or craft armor with wings that makes moving around much more bearable.
- There's no fast travel in a traditional sense. Your best bet to get home if you're far away is to quit to menu and and load back in. Later on you unlock a... Very creative tool to travel large distances quickly.

Surviving:
- Very basic. There's one bar for hunger and that's it. Food doesn't spoil, so you can just stock up on berries or whatever and you're set.
- Unlike in Valheim, foods don't give buffs to HP or stamina. It's only function is to fill up the hunger bar, or give yourself a warmth boost during winter.

Base building:
- As mentioned before, very Valheim-y. You craft a hammer, put resources in your inventory and place building blocks one by one. If you messed up, deconstructing gives you all items back.
- Snapping works very well.
- There's an ""advanced rotate"" mechanic that allows you to rotate all pieces in each axis as you see fit. Very cool.
- There's a decent amount of shapes of walls, roofs, windows etc., so if you're more creative than I am, you can make a nice base.
- There's also furniture you can build purely for decoration, if you're into that.

Progression:
- You unlock new recipes by picking stuff up.
- Certain recipes are unlocked after you kill a boss and deliver an item to an NPC.
- There's no leveling in any form. No skill trees, no classes, nothing.

Other things:
- Decent amount of session customization. You can toggle peaceful mode, dropping your inventory on death. There's also multipliers for day/night cycle, seasons cycle, hunger rate, damage dealt to/by enemies and fall damage. Very nice.
- Only punishment for death is you lose all items you didn't have equipped. There's no extra wear on tools/weapons/armor, no debuffs. You only lose your stuff and you can get it all back by going back to where you died.
- Vast majority of mobs in the game are aggressive by default. Makes early-mid game exploration a bit of a pain, since it can be tricky to lose them.
- ...but you can make them fight each other if you need to make a run for it or have a hard time fighting something.
- Certain early game items (like a wood sword or a basic healing bandage) have to be crafted via crafting station. Why can hand-craft a torch and a club but not a sword, arrows or a hatchet?
- No crafting directly from chests and no way to pin crafting recipes to the UI. I hope you like going through chests to pick up items you've written down in Notepad or something.
- No batch crafting. Need to make 20 of an item? Get your autoclicker on.
- Going to specific NPCs to craft armor is a strange choice. If I have to talk to an NPC to unlock a recipe, that's fine, you're rewarding exploration. But if you make me haul butt JUST to craft the armor, what's the point?
- Since you have to equip weapons and tools from inventory to the paperdoll UI, your inventory can get very messy after some time. I like having things in order and it ever-so slightly bothers me if they aren't.
- The grappling gun is hot garbo.

Yes, people are going to compare it to Grounded because you are small and nature is big, and if you like that, you will probably like this. There are some similar game elements. However, this game is also very different in many ways, enough to be an exciting, unique entry/experience. Compared to Grounded this world feels MUCH more open world to me. Sometimes I enjoy just wandering around the landscape and taking in the sites. In Grounded you definitely feel like you are sandboxed (not that that is a bad thing, it is just a different thing/feel). 

I enjoy this game waaaay more than I thought I would. Even in Early Access it is very well designed, has smooth gameplay (no over-focus on tedious activities and the menus and mechanics are smooth and NOT clunky). The game just has a great feel. Combat is challenging. Progression is good. Gliding is hella fun!!
It's also cool how you can naturally choose you play style on the fly: don't feel like fighting right now? You can probably stealth around the situation. Feel like a mix, try to sneak up for a free hit. Or don't want to waste time with finesse, cool just charge on in. Dodge rolling evasion is fun too!

And of course one of the 1st things you will notice is that it is GORGEOUS!!!  Honestly, when I first played it, that was one of the things that kept me going and made me give it a fair shake (since I felt initial bias/loyalty toward Grounded). To me it has a very mystical, fairy-land vibe to it which is very enjoyable (mixed with the mystique of the ""lost civilization"" left behind by ""the Giants"") I just wish the female character choice was more FEMALE and attractive. Currently looks just like a thinner dude. You can't see yourself often, but still... with graphics THIS Epic? Please don't neglect your woman.  :(

taming creatures could be a little more interesting and even when you tame its not fantastic.
i tamed a gecko and it says they can climb slopes or such, it doesnt do that well and maybe should have a feature to climb vertically like geckos do IRL and mounts instantly die when they fall in deep water, had like 2 seconds to try and save it... RIP gecky....
youre character cant swim and i feel like its okay but maybe give player a chance to swim out of the danger rather sink like stones.

It is very fast paced, which wouldn't be so bad if at the beginning you weren't so weak and useless. You get no shield, a block button that doesn't block much, a dodge you may have to remap to your mouse for quicker use and there are ants and beetles all over the starting point who swarm you, follow you relentlessly and it explains very little to you outside of of brief popups that feel optional. There are a bunch of assets you can just walk through like they aren't there, such as bundles of grass, small plants, etc. gathering materials requires you to first destroy the object and then click the material on the ground, when auto pickup seems simple and easy to implement. I'm 3 hours in and I've already decided this game is discount Grounded with some cool ideas; one of which is taming creatures mid-fight.

You can tame bugs as mounts which is an awesome touch, and i will definitely keep playing to experience that level of freedom from this game. That sai, I think the early game needs a bit more polish, the game could use some overall but still looks amazing when I'm not being pedantic about the assets and I look forward to finding cool, hidden stuff.

Oh, also, and this makes some sense but is really over the top and should change: you can't swim at all and will drown in shoulder height water. Maybe there's a valid in world reason, but mechanically it hinders exploration pretty bad at the start, as there is a river just a bit too wide to jump all around the first area. Building bridges isn't easy either, but I expected that so it isn't such a bad point, but my stairs never work on the beaches with my bridges and I have yet to find the ramp if there is one as a building option.

Despite my grievances, play this game, especially if you found Grounded a bit to cartoony or childish. Its hard, which it doesn't always need to be at all, but it is breathtaking and beautiful and begrudgingly fun. Give it a couple dozen hours like i plan to to say you tried and I'm sure plenty of people will find themselves in the endgame with dozens of hours and giant structures.

I also understand my ease of playing will come with time, but it bothers me the start doesn't feel very new player friendly, it just kind of tells you what to do, barely explains where to go and doesn't even let you craft your own armor at first, you need NPC's for that. I'm excited for updates, but i do have problems with some of the systems and i do prefer Grounded's concept & execution (I do much prefer the fantasy aesthetic of this game however and would endlessly play this if it was as polished and intuitive as some other survival games.)",1683474499,1683474499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Has all the basics that make up a good survival game, resource farming, tiered crafting of weapons and armor, cooking and base building. I like the concept of the great tree locations for safe building and the fact you can move your entire base from one to the other by claiming new ones and essentially relocating your base.

I'm not sold on the taming and tamed creature aspect yet though. When I first saw there were 5 different tamable creatures I was excited to see the variety and what the differences were. The lady bug is the only one who can carry materials for you making it the defacto pack horse and the rest are pretty much just there for something to ride on and offer minimal combat support. I'd like to see more special abilities for each creature giving some more incentive to capturing the different tames. Also the fact you can only have 1 tamed creature at a time meaning you have to release your current one to tame something else really sucks. There should be a way to stable your active pet and utilize another one without having to release them.

The building mechanic is pretty good, very similar to Valheim and offers a pretty good variety of building structures and pieces for those who like to make unique and ornate bases. I tend to stick to functional and basic buildings so I didn't really push the limits. No structural integrity mechanic is nice for the creative folks as well.

I'd really like to see a ""craft all"" or at least ""craft qty"" function. Having to single click through crafting when you want to make like 50 to 60 of something is kind of a pain in the butt.

Food system seems to be lacking as well in the regard that most of the food offers the exact same nutritional value with a few giving a cold resistance buff. Maybe look to have some give damage boost and others give stamina boosts or something to just separate them a little bit and give players the ability to customize their food consumption a bit.

The game really needs to allow dedicated servers through some of the server hosting websites, that's become a staple of this genre and this game stands out in a negative way by only allowing local hosting and requiring the host to be on for others to play the game.

Overall pretty solid and definitely worth the $25 it's selling for now if you're a fan of the survival genre.",1683046719,1683046719,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Pros:
-If you love building, this game is fun. I enjoyed building my base and had a lot of fun getting creative with it. The customizability of items could be expanded but overall, good. I wish there were more decorations -- rugs, curtains, shutters, railing pattern options, etc. Perhaps these will be released in future patches.
-The armor looks really cool and isn't out of reach from a material-gathering perspective. 
-It is grindy in the beginning, but once you get your first winged armor set you snowball which becomes really fun.
-I love how easy it is to move your base.
-The game is almost entirely bug-free -- no glitches, server issues, etc. that we encountered that were game-specific.

Neutral:
-There is no leveling of skills. It occurs with weapon and armor scaling. I personally like to know that I am increasing an ability when I am grinding because it feels rewarding, but this isn't necessarily a con.

Cons:
-My partner and I got through the entire early access game in a weekend, while taking our time. Curently it isn't ""enough"" gameplay -- this will be resolved in future patches but I am reviewing it in its current state.
-My partner's computer crashed once (an issue with his computer, not the game). Unfortunately the crash wiped his map clean of all explored territory, markers, etc. After a quick google search, this appears to be a common bug but if you don't have a computer that crashes, you should have no issue.
-Some of the bosses (king stag, rhino beetle, albino spider) were not much more difficult than or sometimes even easier than regular bugs (water bugs, geckos, stag beetles). I think they could be scaled up.

Ill drop a few ideas here as Im good with concept but shite with coding lol. All in all I'm EXCITED to see where this goes and hope this gets tons more content and features and support! MORE STORY TOO! That makes these survivals interesting is the compelling story behind it all!!!! It keeps us going! Never stop developing the story guys. The story will take you to new areas and new content in general so don't just give us stuff with no story lol.

1. Let us find a guy that can teach us to swim and fly! You can add crabs, crayfish, fish, diving spiders etc to the world expanding it exponentially and allowing spears to be the most effective weapon underwater or make harpoon guns etc. I like the idea of a poison spider fang or bee stinger dagger for diving. Also you should include a set of armor that uses stamina or a fuel source for full flight. 

2. Let us go inside bug dens! They can be separate load areas for quick dungeon crawls and special creatures like ant colonies and queens! We could go into bee and wasp nests to tame or make war with them and harvest special unique resources. 

3. more tames and multiple tames! why not allow the nocturnal grasshopper and ladybug to just use the regular ladybug and grasshopper treats if they're equal in stats. also please more than one soon!

4. This should be first and foremost honestly lol Structural support beams! We need diagonal and horizontal support beams badly!!! I can only build so high and I don't understand the physics you're using for it. We need a way to build out more and the support beams need to be stronger than anything else as they are the skeleton and should be able to touch ground and add more integrity. 

5. More Weapons and armor made from bugs! Let the bugs drop special parts for each bug like ""jeweled beetle shell"" from the big green ones and ""flimsy beetle shell"" from the sawyers. the sawyer beetle armor can give bonuses to harvest rate, tool lifespan increase and the green one could give gliding and boosted harvest, slightly better def and maybe increased move speed. You can do this with all the armors and let the base game armors be the cheap starter sets. Also let the spider armor give you a web grapple gun with infinite shots and you also should fix the grapple gun as its kinda useless lol you need to be able to repel and climb higher and swinging doesn't work lol. 

6. Expand environments. Future content updates could include things like deserts, jungles and other places. More creatures like mice, birds, snakes, more bugs!!! lol lots more bugs! If humanity is wiped out you could make mutant or magical creatures. Also possibly adding magic of some kind? Via staff or wand that you can equip with spells. the better the wand or staff the more spells you can equip. you can make it easy like a gun you aim and you will take a stance then use the buttons to cast the spell its linked to. So I can aim my wand and press triangle and it will cast lightning or circle and it will do fire wall. Let us hold the cast button to see the cast radius and area etc.",1682960607,1682960607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. I started off right away enjoying the game, as time went on Smalland grew on me more and more.
2. Game world is a Solid 7/10, I get the blurry distance however I am more of a fan for being able to see as far out as I can and enjoy a beautifully created world, so the game stops at a 8/10 for me.
3. Combat: 7/10, its fun for me, needs some work being early access.
4. Story: short and simple.
5. Gliding/flying: solid 10/10, absolutely love that aspect in the game and totally changed how the world and movement feel.
6. Cosmetics: Armor sets are decent 7/10, some look pretty cool. Hope they add some more styles in the future. Maybe quest lines where a player can go out and EARN a new style of armor or be able to customize the armor set once they complete a quest line that would be tough and long to get done.
7. Exploration: freedom, 10/10 the games does not hold back on the OPEN world feel and freedom of movement.
8. Camera views: 8/10 being able to freely adjust from 1st person to third person with zoom is a solid quality of life to have in a game.
9. CO-OP 10/10 
10. Solo 7/10
11. Building, solid 7/10 
12. Crafting, solid 6/10 does not hold one's hand and gives it to people, I enjoying going out and earning what I have, I hope they keep up with this in future development and make it worth what one puts in and get out of it.
13. Crafting stations. 8/10 great art work, solid idea like Valheim for upgrades and needing multiply stations to create items from. 
14. Extra home furnishings: 8/10 please keep adding more to the game, thanks for what you have already added .
15. PLEASE add more enemy's and make some much more difficult 

There is more I could comment on, however that hits the points I want to express here. Give the game some time and LEARN, like any game take time to LEARN.

So much room for new content and finetuning - let's see where it goes.

What I'd love to see in future (which is currently not on the roadmap):
- raids towards your home + defense possibilities (maybe even storms having impact on your building, currently stronger materials only have cosmetic impact)
- character progress
- advanced combat options (maybe even cast spells, work with cooldowns, combos etc.)
- more realistic differentiation between night and day animals (no bees out at night, but maybe other night active animals which really exist) - same goes for seasons",1682587717,1682587717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My only complaints so far is the companion system is an absolute mess along with the Stamina System. The wings you can get with your armor take stamina, and I mean absolutely drain it. I'm confused as to why there's a stamina drain when you don't move the wings; it's just gliding. 

As far as the companions, they are unfortunately useless.
Grasshoppers take one hop and the stamina is dead, so good luck if it decides to jump somewhere unfavorable.
Ladybugs do not drop your items upon death - it's all just GONE.
Geckos do not work, literally at all; they aren't really even good fighters.
Damselflies are useless, as they don't hover over water, have no speed and also can't fly? 
It's easier to just hard-core parkour with your armor than ride it. I understand having stamina, but that damselfly literally is always hovering when you engage them; so it doesn't make sense.

I haven't gotten the spider (not a big fan of the 8 legged friends) but I assume they won't be great either. 
I plan on updating my review later cause I know this game will get better.

Oh and lastly, please fix the texture issues, having unlatching floors drives me nuts and all you can do is rotate your floors.

There are some strong bones to it;
Environment is pretty, early crafting materials are still usable for crafting better items later on, gliding through the air feels nice, and mounts are kinda cool.

However, it still needs work in a lot of places:
Combat is bad and very basic. A lot of enemies can be cheezed by leading them to the end of their territory and attacking them when their AI forces them back to their start zone. Stamina system is clunky and if you start a dodge without stamina you're locked in place like a sitting duck. Holes in trees, burrows, and the ground are just black walls that can't be explored. The weather system doesn't really change anything, outside the fact that there is snow on the ground, other than your character being cold and having to don shittier, non-flying armor to stay warm. Storms are more annoying than interesting. The most interesting bit of scenery couldn't be reached due to an invisible wall blocking it, which was the point I decided I was done with the game.

As it went through other developers and grew I was still excited to get my hands on it. I enjoy open world survival games with friends, I enjoy RPGs because they are so immersive with a good story line, and I used to play MMOs with friends and family. After waiting so long for this games release and the promise of a ""Massive"" open world, all I can say is I am disappointed. This game feels like its attempting to fall into all 3 categories, which is awesome that they are pushing for something a little different, but I feel like its caused them to fall short in any one area. The monsters AI is broken and easy to figure out after a fight or 2, the world is actually quite small, there isnt much to craft when you start learning the recipes,  you have to carry a building hammer to construct anything other then a basic item or torch so it eats up an inventory slot. your choice of weapon feels very short, basic bow or sword construct, even though there  are choices it feels like they left the weapons open for a ""blank slate"" to kind of fill in later. The NPCs you come into contact with seem very robotic and its hard to be immersed in a world were they dont even make a noise and just stay where they are for the entirety of the game. Like I said it can deffinately be a fun game for a lower price but what was promised and advertised i feel like they fell short on.

Pros
Lots of content
Visually stunning
Unique in terms of armor crafting and mounting
Great combat apart from the blocking mechanic which is slow and useless as it uses up all your stamina, might as well just swing the enemy to death.
Building is great - plus points for being able to move your base from tree to tree without starting over.

Cons
Can't swim - ugh
Blocking mechanism
Fall damage is too sensitive
Inventory and storage management isnt great - they could take a lesson from Grounded on this one.
Companions need to dial it down, regardless of putting the companion on ""stay"" they always insist on joining the fight and taking the aggro. 99% getting killed in the fight anyway... so frustrating.

Overall this is a great game with little to no bugs (no pun intended). I'm really looking forward to the future content of this game and sure I will have many hours of fun with this.

It is nice, most of the things work. But it has many annoying bugs. I just list the most annoying bug, which for me count as A bugs. 
1. When you die, you don't get your stuff back in 99% of the cases. -> this is not the case anymore, but the stuff sometimes lays on a strange position
2. This is a game wants encouraging coop multiplayer, but once you left the game and want to join the server again, you won't find your friend's world anymore.
3. The world is extremely small, no pun intended, but the area of the game is small, not much to discover.
4. The overall player's progress is badly balanced

The graphics are nice, sound is ok, grinding feels ok-ish.

after almost 30  hrs of playing. My view on this games stays the same. It feels extremely clunky. During fights it doesn't react as fast as it should. Changing weapons is sometimes so bugged, that you character ""forgets"" how to attack. And you will die, bc the char only walks now. 
The animatations always need to be finalized until it reacts or does something else. E.g. drinking a potion can kill you instead of healing you.",1680607311,1682250186,False,3,0,0.493460178375244141,1,True,False,True

The bugs are brutal and the bosses are challenging - there is a lot to do and see.  I've very much enjoyed it so far and I see myself spending many more hours playing.  I see myself coming back to play multiple times.  There are some things i'm hoping they add/change: 1) an auto-run key bind  2) a way to form guilds/companies so that you can have joint ownership of your Treehouse -so that your group can bind there and when they log back into the game - everyone will spawn into the treehouse and not just person who claimed the tree originally. 3) A ""save"" button to save your server settings so that you don't have to redo them everytime you log in to play the game.   All in all, I feel Smalland is a great game for where it is in it's development and I am really looking forward to the upcoming things they highlighted in the roadmap for the year ahead.
*Update* 4/23/2023  I wanted to come back and edit my review after playing the game all the way through.  The game needs several Quality of life additions, but the Devs have pleasantly surprised everyone by getting some of those into the game quickly since it's release - and that's wonderful. You can adjust how many hours are in each day and how many are in each season.  Your server settings are now saved so that you don't have to make these adjustments each time you open your server too.  Some things they still need to add:  1) a way to name each storage chest so that you don't have to go through each and every one of them to find what you need 2) A button to organize your inventory 3) They need to do something so that it's not so easy to release your current pet/mount - perhaps a confirm button or something. 4) Perhaps a server setting that lets you turn down the frequency of storms (though I LOVE the storms - there are just too many of them) 4) Building: they need to add half walls and perhaps the ability to rotate building pieces not only horizontally - but vertically as well.  
I have finished my first play though - We didn't rush through the content - preferring instead, to take our time, and really enjoy and explore all this game has to offer. I loved this game so much - I felt sad when we finished, killed all bosses, crafted all gear and tried out all of the mounts/pets - as well as building an amazing base.  I honestly cannot wait for future content and hope it doesn't take too long.  Would I recommend the purchase of this game?  1000% I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Valheim.

The world is full of unique creatures and environments that make it fun to explore. The graphics are also impressive, with detailed textures and vibrant colors that bring the world to life. The huge tree bases system is also great which allows to moves your buildings from one tree to another. Not to mention taming creatures - grasshopper go yeet. 

However, the game has some cons as well. (at the 5hrs of total)

Inventory system is confusing and messy. Instead of a traditional hotbar and inventory system, the game uses a left-right hand system with hotkey setup, causing items to move around and making it difficult to keep track of everything. When selecting a tool or weapon, it automatically moves to your hand, requiring constant reorganization. Controls are also bad. Just make a more traditional approach (ie. Valheim, Minecraft, Conan, Frozen Flame, V-Rising, and etc.) and don't try to invent something new - it's not working as suspense in fight (unlike in Resident Evil or Arma) and it's just annoying in other actions (unlike in Astroneer, Fallout 4/76, Skyrim).

Dodging and evading mechanics. When attempting to dodge an attack by jumping and striking from above, the hitbox can become elongated or remain on the same place, leading to potential damage. Additionally, when circling around an enemy during a strong attack, the enemy may suddenly turn the entire model towards the player instead of finishing the attack in the original position.

Another point is optimization. Can you explain - how in the world my Ryzen 9 5900X, 1660 OC (I know - it's slightly above minimal but hear me out) works fine with UE4 games such as Rising Storm Vietnam (with same volumes of trees and plants) 144 FPS on ultra-settings, Conan (depends of map but with basically the same as RSV) 144 FPS on high-settings, Satisfactory (with 20-floors factory in the middle of forest near water source) 144 FPS on high-settings, but with Smallands I've got GPU kernel errors, drops from 60 to 30 FPS and even if PC turned into airplane engine mode with 100% fan speeds all over the case? Not to mention early-access games on Unity with max FPS.

Overall - the game is neat and I want to play with it more but instead of it I'll sell my left kidney to buy ""decent"" GPU for early-access state.",1682243849,1682243849,True,1,0,0.503225803375244141,0,True,False,True

While my overall reaction is a thumbs up, please note, THIS IS EARLY ACCESS!! There are a lot of balancing and content that needs to be added ( if you play, you will feel the gaps in gameplay) but again, this is an early access review. 

Pricepoint:
25$ for the state of the game? mehh.... I would settle for 20$. But, the devs did take their time with making sure the released a decent early access game, so i accepted it for 25$. 

Overall the initial release of this game was amazing. They released the game with minimal bugs and a decent amount of content. The hope is that there are continued updates and content additions as this game has a LOT of potential, and i will update my review as updates come out. 

Multiplayer: 
Playable and enjoyable. I hosted and had 1 friend join, and he only experienced a few issues that were resolved by both of us restarting the game from the desktop. Nothing at this time broke multiplayer gameplay. 

Personal Likes: (There are far less of these than my dislikes, but it did not take away from the playability or enjoyment) 
The Game is very pretty. The devs definitely took their time with their models and meshes. 
For a first release, there is a decent amount of content. 
Tool progression feels balanced to me. A friend and I were able to get to flint tools by hour 4 by just grinding and protecting each other. (This was also effected by reduced bug damage, and increased player damage) 
The Tree system for bases was an incredible add. Overall i will keep this in my likes category, but I do think it could be worked a bit (Like adding an unlock system for the hot air balloon or some sort of cost for claiming a tree) as it is way to easy to find the nearest base tree, finding the Hot Air Balloon, and claiming and going to the top. This for me does take away from the base defense option, but the base building itself was solid. 

Personal Opinions for game improvements:
Bugs are a little too hard and overwhelming. I had to reduce the amount of damage they did, and increase the amount of damage I dealt just to make the game more enjoyable due to the sheer amount of bugs there were. I feel this could be balanced better. 
Bees attack range is OP. I have been killed by bees more than any other bug. You cannot outrun them, and their stinger range is further than the physical model. Meaning, I would get hit by the stinger when I never even saw the stinger touch my body. 
Durability needs improved or balanced with combat. I can barely make a run half way across the map without the durability on my items breaking from the amount of combat i go through. I have to bring several tools and occasionally a second set of armor if i go on longer runs. 
To add onto durability, buildings need adjusted. After 2-3 storms (literally can happen in one trip depending on how far you go) which can destroy your crafting bench and other placed buildings. 
There needs to be natural shelters throughout the world. Ex, i should be able to go hide in that shoe from the storm, especially as you cannot go on an adventure without getting hit by a storm or 2, and the amount of health these storms take from you is OP. You cannot survive your first few nights, and your focus is trying to get fiber to make bandages which is very scarce until you have tier 2 tools to harvest fiber. 
I feel there should be a zone progression in the map. Meaning, the further you move from original spawn, the harder it gets.   This could potentially be fixed with bug balancing in my note above. You are immediately thrown into every type of bug the moment you leave home tree, and your first hour of survival is just trying to avoid combat and get to the guy that gives stone armor just to increase suitability odds.

Cons:
constant fast respawns of all items, mobs, bosses is a downer.   no way to tune the rate to your liking. thats the biggest downside to the game.  you kill the 3 mobs at your base, go inside, when you go back outside there they are. in the same exact spot doing the same exact pathing.  its really ruins the immersion and makes the game a chore.  There is a toggle to turn off all mob aggro but it all or nothing with no way to tune it down, modify the mob behaviour, respawn etc.    I hate it.    same items respawn in a few game mins in the same place.   pls devs, put in more adaptability for players.",1682036731,1682036731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can tell the Dev team and others have put a lot of thought and work into the game so far. A lot of their upcoming updates and interactive FAQ's to better their game is phenomenal. I can't wait for the new updates. It definitely still needs polishing and balance changes. 

- Very well scaled to being the size of a bug. The map itself looks like a very easy to get across and almost small, but then you begin to travel around and are surprisingly further than you thought. 
It is very realistic in that aspect and it immersed me even more into the game play. 

- Convenience of Great trees, sure they are fairly spaced out and it does take a little time to figure out where the platform is, but once you find the hot air lift platform it's insanely easy to find your way up the tree. 
One of the first mounts in the game, the Grasshopper makes this even easier! Then later you unlock your first gliding armor which can make travel insanely easy. 
Just take the hot air lift up your tree and walk all the way out on one of the branches and jump in direction of your goal after making sure there is no water below (happened once and your gravestone is whenever your feet last touched the ground thank god.) 

-Mounts! They very well need to be polished but they add so much mobility and immersion. The character model is perfectly scaled in comparison. 
It starts from grasshopper and continues to Gecko and then a wolf spider and finally a Damselfly. They are insanely immersive and work fairly well in their specific uses. 
I do wish they were a little more polished with movement and stamina usage to balance it. Overall i absolutely loved having a companion and I can't wait to see whats next. 

-Definitely needs refining on combat and hit boxes. It honestly was a little weak in our game play. We speed ran the whole game up to Blue Hornet boss for the last available armor set, in padded armor (+1 Protection). It was honestly more dark souls play through of dodge and learning their attack patterns, with only one death at the Horned beetle right in the beginning. 
It could be a little harder. We used Simple bandages for most of our play through and then finally got Honey bandages near the end. If you learn to dodge well and have another person to play this game with it can insanely easy. 

-There wasn't a lot of direction for the quest. It was almost too open, and we just continued forward without even getting some of the simple stone armor and other such items. It almost forces you to read everything and get into the lore of it all.
 In my opinion it should give a little more direction for those who choose to have it in their options ( like a quest log almost). 
We did eventually end up figuring out how to progress and just never picked up new armor sets after our first winter.

Difficulty can be set and multiplayer is active, though no static servers exist yet.

The world is beautiful and feels vast.  It also feels as though there is plenty of room for growth - both in landsize and questlines.

Character creation is somewhat limited in options though there are a good variety of variables to change.

Players who experience vertigo or have photosensitive issues may have trouble - because you play as a small person in a giant world, you're doing a lot of jumping and being in high spaces; the main tool to find resources washes out the screen and has a bright pulse that might affect some players.  There is no gamma sliders, so viewers with shading issues will need to adjust manually through their video cards.

My current opinion of this game is that it is a perfect introduction to survival/builder games, particularly if you've never played before.  The difficulty settings allow a new, inexperienced player to experience the game at various levels of danger and QOL settings that can be frustrating to people new to this genre.

There are bugs and issues to deal with (Fatal Errors happen fairly often) but we have to remember we're in early access.

The multiplayer feature is fantastic.  As is the way bases work and shift with the character regardless of single or multiplayer gaming.

My only complaint is that the geometry is off with some of the building pieces such as the concave floors and the mounts need work because they run away and leave your service so often I've stopped using them entirely. However, these are such small issues they hardly detract from the game. 

My advice for new players is to harvest and craft new ingredients as soon and as frequently as possible. Try to ditch the wood tools early on and keep upgrading whenever you can. Craft things you don't think you'll use as they'll often unlock new useful items. Also, take advantage of the tree tops!

I rarely grab a game in alpha stage, but something about this one caught my attention. I managed to get it at a sale price and am enjoying my savings so far. The world is well thought out and the environment is intuitive. Building is a bit of a pain, but I've played with worse. The mechanics remind me a lot of Valheim, which I couldn't get into. Maybe it's the push of the world that keeps me going in this one. It feels like there is always something specific making you hunt down that beetle over and over again, or making you look for nector, etc... There is a need to move on and keep looking while going at your own pace.

There are plenty of challenges, big and small, and plenty of views that keep your curiosity going. Some things like collecting and eating seem imbalanced at first, but after a while, you get the hang of it. Night time pushes you to seek shelter or get lost; storms have the same affect.

No. Long way distant from that.

[*]This game feels more like a quest driven RPG with tiny bits of survival in it.
[*]Your character does not have any stats, there's no experience gain and no new abilities to learn.
[*]Combat is not rewarding and takes almost no skill because of shallow mechanics.
[*]Farming and crafting are mostly tedious things which requires a lot of aimed clicks to be performed.
[*]I tamed a ladybug and I could not ride it...that's almost rude.
[*]Only one tame at a time. I had to release the ladybug to tame a grasshopper.
[*]I tamed a majestic grasshopper, and I was pretty sure it would bring me anywhere. Turns out it couldn't fly, barely moving faster than me on foot, and jumping around dangerously without a proper control. Landed in the water few minutes later, we drowned side by side.

Quests are a vague duty that have to be done with no hurry - hey, the queen is dieing, but take your time and have a look around everywhere. The worst of all this is the lack of good thoughts for the future development, I mean, even if in early access the mechanics looks like set and probably not undergoing big changes.

The pleasure I've found is the immersion of exploring a beautifully well made environment in both graphics and sound, and making progress with crafting using new materials found wandering around, which is not enough to justify the price.

This game seems to not be able to decide if it is an RPG or a survival, and at the moment fails at both.
Considering all the past early access experience I've made, I don't believe it will become interesting. Let's hope I'm wrong since they have my money already.

P.S.: Pretty much every game is early access these days and I hate early access. So many games in the library and so few playable ones.",1681857421,1681859727,False,18,4,0.479257315397262573,0,True,False,True

Got a ways to go (am playing just after early access release).
Has the making of a fun survival themed game that I would like to share with friends.

Hoping for more story and NPC quests to improve the PvE experience as things develop.  Its a bit light on that at the moment, but its early days.

The only really unacceptable thing is the movement system, which is so bad that fighting and climbing become a factor of luck. This is another game with a nonsense stamina mechanic just to add to the blunt movement and combat system. The jumping in this game is the most horrible thing I've experienced in years. Ragequit guaranteed! If you thougt the Valheim Controls are bad, welome to the next level! The Char turns always with delay, the attacks are delayed, the block does not work, the mobs flicker around or freezing in front of you and can not be hit (hello Valheim!), after attacks you get slowed and you can not move, it is a mess. Sliding would be a way to get away from mobs, but i experienced to many bugs with this feature. This starts with not standing up and sliding slowly forever while being beaten up, sliding straight down a stone only to hit a small ledge that is not even visible which will shot you into another direction. Usually you then fall over a ledge or into water and can once again run to your corpse. No fun.
The icons of all the resources are unreadable and too small. Everything looks the same. The UI is very left-heavy. When you open a chest, the big inventory is your own on the left and the small one on the right is the chest. This feels a bit wrong if you don't look into the chest, but into your own inventory. I always have to think twice about what's what.
Apart from that, the game is quite nice. Gfx needs to be better, music should be better, SFX is ok, movement and fights need to be reworked to make it a better game. Battles are not very hard, no tactics needed. If there is more than 1 mob at a time you can get into trouble because movement is bad. Your deaths are mostly caused by falls when jumping goes wrong or you get knocked off some walls and floors.
I like the fact that you have to go hunting for resources. In Valheim you were more likely to go mine ores or other stuff and get harassed by mobs on the side, here you go hunt for the mobs and harvest some stuff along the way.
The world looks great and is very immersive, the insects and animals look great, a story is there and fits the environment, the story telling and also the Introduction at the beginning of the game looks like a placeholder atm. I hope they will invest a bit more in this before release. I havnt seen to much of the impact of weather on teh environment so far beside that it gets white in winter. That you can move with your whole base from tree to tree is a nice feature, but i could not see a reason for it (till now). Menus opens and closes with delay and animation - Please don't do that! This is terrible and the opposite of usability!
Build and item progression felt ok and balanced in the first 10 hours.
All in all, this can be a very good game. At the moment the movement system is the biggest weakness, everything else is digestible. The price seems ok for the amount of hours you can play. So, now I'm going back to work on my wings so that I don't die from another fall.

Last Update: Another huge weak point is the predefined, non-changing map and the set spawns of the mobs and ressources. After you have explored the map for the first time, you then just go straight to the places to collect mobs and resources, knowing exactly which mobs you will encounter at which place. That is pretty boring and I can not see any replay value in this design. This game is not a Survival game, maybe it has some aspects of this genre, but this is not survival, because you know exactly where to go and get things. So all that remains is the fighting and that is not properly done.

Although the graphics are amazing its too dark. I find myself waiting most of my play time because even with both kinds of torches I can't see diddily squat. 
Structures are flat and angle based and too difficult to snap evenly.
Lots of water areas but can't swim? WHAT? Lame!!!
 A grapple gun that just stops only half way off of the ground? You guys do know what a grapple gun and hook is right? Only useful for swinging, (should have just given us a vine whip instead) but if you lose momentum you're basically just hanging there with no way to build momentum again. Hope you have wings! Looks like they tried to mimic Just Cause 4's grapple and glide but failed. You cant even ascend or descend. LAME!!!! 
Grounded at ""leads"" had  building pieces to build on water, in fact most survivor sandbox games offer those, what happened here? Swimming is an awesome part of a lot of these similar games as well way to take the hard dive to death on that call. Grounded at least gave armor pieces that make swimming possible. I mean you'll make armor fit for flight but not for the water? Does someone work there not really know what is relative common sense? Do you guys really make video games or is this your first project. 
you know when you see a preview to a movie that you think might be good because they put more into the hype than the actual completed film and then you see the best parts were in the trailer and you watch it and not so good after-all? Yeah Smalland...... It's like that. So you can fantasize with misspelling the title, the lore and world, but not add great realism to it and make it rational? OKAY! LAAAAAAAAAAAME!!!!!

Smalland is a cute game which, at the time of this review, has a small bit of story for you to follow, but is mostly about building a base and enjoying the landscape. You play a Smallfolk who's part of a group called the Vanguards, and it's your task to help find a cure for your queen, who is apparently down with some type of sickness. Turns out, the cure was supposedly kept in a box but the key to that box is missing. In your travels throughout the currently available map, you meet various other Smallfolk who ask you to take on some big enemies in exchange for recipes, access to certain armours, or just out of the kindness of your heart.

Let's look at the plus sides first: Smalland is very pretty! The surroundings are well-made and since the latest patch the transition between the seasons looks smoother. The various creatures you come across look very true to life, as well. As I mentioned, base-building is definitely a large part of the joy of this game, and the materials you can build with look very cool! Building high up in one of the game's giant trees specifically placed there for the purpose can be really rewarding, but you can also build your base on the ground elsewhere. I can't guarantee enemies won't try to attack it if it's within their range, but I can't really say with certainty if that's a thing. Being able to use a grappling gun and hooks to swing around is a lot of fun as well, but there's definitely some skill involved so be prepared to make a lot of hooks. At least the latest patch means you won't drop like a brick when you slam into something, and thank goodness for that. The amount of pancaking I've done...

Now for some of the less stellar parts of the game, beginning with the stack size. According to at least one other review, the stack size used to be fifty, but they scaled that down to 30 and for cooked items  even 20. Personally, that seems counterproductive; when you're building, you need a lot of materials, and the stacks being this small isn't great. There are still some bugs in the game other than the ones you fight, and there have been instances in both single and multiplayer where the stamina bar would stop refilling. Mind you, I have only two instances of those in the previous patch, so that may have already been fixed.
The big thing, however, and the one that really hurts, is the taming aspect. It's fun to be able to tame a grasshopper or ladybug to help you out, but these animals are squishy and seem to have no sense of their own survival. I'd love to use my ladybug more for gathering resources, but I'm too worried the poor thing'll get eaten, so I just keep it at home like a little pet friend, which rather defeats the purpose. You can only tame one animal at a time, but that's not necessarily clear, at least it wasn't to me. I was trying to tame another creature and the tame prompt did show up; pressing the button just didn't do anything, and I ended up feeling like an idiot when I found out through another review that you could only have one tame animal at a time. Also, the main benefit of having a riding animal is utterly dwarfed by being able to use the grappling hook. The only potential benefit of the animal - keeping your stamina - is undone by the fact that your animal is squishy, which makes it unlikely that you'd end up in a place where having your stamina bar full would even matter. 

The other thing I am a bit sad about is the lack of customisation. For example, there is currently no way to recolour your armour, which would go a long way. I would also love to see more body type, face, and particularly hair options (Nok has the best hair, give it to us!). With regards to building, which is a big part of the game's appeal, I weep for the lack of decorations and things to put on the walls of my formerly creepy but currently fairly nice-looking Faectorian manor, and I think some paintings and more pieces of furniture would make great additions. Maybe even the ability to mount the heads of your defeated foes? Options, that's all I want. Tasty, tasty options.

Let's talk resource gathering for a bit. Other reviews of this game will probably mention how most of the later-game resources are spread out across the far sides of the map, and that's true. While I agree it's not particularly convenient, especially if you find yourself dying and end up right back where you last set your spawn point (your bed, to be clear,), I'm personally not too bothered by this. I like that you have to be prepared when you go out and that you have to take your time to either gather or bring enough resources for a crafting table and a temporary shelter. There's something to be said for a game that doesn't let you run through things, and I quite liked taking my time with the gathering and then going back to the nearest giant tree with my earnings. Honestly, claiming trees is where it's at since it'll get you a base that's always nearby. Those mobile tree bases are a good move.

All in all, Smalland has a lot of potential and I look forward to what the developers have planned on their road map. The game has its pros and cons, but it's definitely worth getting for the current gameplay options you have.

This game is a lot of fun. Feels a lot like Valheim, but miniature. Similar to Valheim, you'll unlock new crafting recipes by picking up new materials, with some of them being locked behind tiered bosses. Unlike Valheim, doesn't have boats, but it does have gliding wings (once you unlock them) and insect/gecko mounts. The mounts are a little awkward or buggy (heh heh) to ride for now, and I didn't get much use out of them in their current state, but the gecko was pretty cool to keep by your side after the first boss because he's such a good fighter against the easy bugs while you're still fairly weak.

The bosses get fairly hard, but beatable with better weapons/armor/potions, in single player, but I haven't played in multiplayer yet to know whether they're easier, or if their difficulty scales up.

Building is pretty fun, it has a variety of shapes for each of the building materials, as well as allowing a variety of rotation/locking which allows for some creativity. At the time of writing, there is no stress mechanic such as in Valheim.

There's lots to do, lots to find, almost everything is meant to be climbed and I find that amazing.
There are obviously still some bugs, mostly small, I just want to mention for the devs,
-I've seen other people mention that the jump needs to be fixed, I agree I keep getting flung backwards while trying to climb
-The ladybug pets get stuck in everything and will randomly just sit still for a while, sometimes they also don't run from hostiles
-The building mechanics have good foundations, but also a lot of issues, its very sensitive about locking on to a matching piece you have to hit very specific spots for pieces to snap together right, another thing is before the update I was able to build bridges to get across the river, but after I was not able to I don't know if this was intentional, but I liked building the bridges, lots of the interactive items and I would assume cosmetic (but I haven't used those yet) have very large collision boxes compared to the item itself, I've been removing walls to put items down and then rebuilding the wall behind it bc it allows the item to sit further back
-Lots of enemies in walls
-the riding mechanic needs some work it doesn't always work immediately
-My biggest issue so far is that fairly often I am having to go into my inventory to reequip my weapon or tool because the game will not let me use it, it just stops letting me swing or interact with anything until I re equip. Also, sometimes a normal cursor will appear on screen instead of the cross hair and it bugs the game, the only way to get out of this is to alt tab
-Insects getting into closed buildings while player is absent
-The survival needs like food and water feel a little neglected, I feel we could use a little more, not a bug just imo, also feel like tool repair could be updated, but I also don't mind the ease of it as it allows for easier pacing of the game, not constantly having to find materials for repair, but there's so much food I really feel like food and water could be a more heavily used mechanic
-Another opinion, there could be more character customization
-First person is very abrupt and hard to use, I was looking forward to playing in 1st so this is disappointing, but I do like seeing the character
-Inventory moves itself around, leaving items unorganized and hard to find
-Could I suggest Ladybug grave sites?
But overall for a game that just came out its amazing. There was a learning curve, but it's already a great game. 100x better than grounded and worth the extra time they put in.

The dramatic high pitch music parts (start of the song) with storms get on my nerves after awhile but that could just be me, don't get me wrong the music in this game is very well done. I would say more effects and less dramatic music when it comes to storms.

Graphics are pretty good, nothing INSANE.
Fighting is 9/10 nearly perfect.
Movement is nearly perfect.
I don't see the game coming out with much more though as it's really flushed out.

I suspect it has about 26 hours of game-play without any major hitches meaning the game is probably worth 20 dollars.

Finally came across game breaking bugs.
1. Winter makes no logical sense to the core of the game. Why you might ask?
        A. Bugs are dormant during the winter...
        B. Thunder should not be always making noise during SNOW???
2, Lifts lose the barrier that stops you from jumping off during winter causing your death stones to be stuck in air causing you to lose all your tools regrettably making you start over if you don't make multiples of all tools.
3. Armor progression unlocks are way out of sync to the material unlocks and unfortunately one of them for the winter can mess you up because you obtain hide and naturally feel the instinct to turn it all to leather before discovering you needed it to be hide for the winter armor. Horrible feeling. HOWEVER this is the FIRST game to leave build options for both so I can't knock this game for terraria and minecraft and starbound and valheim for being dumb.

Negatives, they have a big church they tease you with that when you get to it... it has an invisible barrier so you can't enter... -_- WHAT....

scaling is odd, grind is odd, game feels safe.

I try to organise the Review in Chapters to make it easer to read:

Grafics: 
The Game looks wonderfull! the Animations, the view in the distance, the Ambient - the light, its an amazing work of art you created!  I sometimes stood above the  Tree and just looked around. If you Don't like Bugs or Spiders - you should be warned that the animals look very realistic in this game! 

Gameplay: 
The Gameplay starts a little slow where you don t know what and where but that changes after getting into it.
There are a few things I would like see different in an later released state (Like some changes in Materials needed to craft stuff - you gather alot of look you will only need for one item -> but could be reused -> example: if you switch the chitin with the mandibles to craft hooks, it would make more sence to clap some ants later in the game)  The Luresystem was quite strange, didn t understand it at first - just after watching an external video. Maybe a better tutorial would help there.
The battle and Stamina system are well made only the Axe was very anoying at first because the range is ... somewhat of? But the Sword is extremly satisfying and my go to weapon. 
The Shooting with the Bow is nice but please tilt the cam a little to the side so you can see the arrow after shooting -> quite hard to guess where you shoot when your shoulder is in the view xD  but the shooting and zooming feels realy well made! Damage is also well balanced
Gathering Resources: 
After some houres of gameplay its somewhat annoying to gather wood ins such low quantitys - I would love the Saplings to drop alil more of the resources so it makes more sence to get better tools to get more of the resources ?  - over all I like the system of first gather by hand- then by tools - also the enemy grind was not very hard for the armores the loot drop need balance is very well made!  
Building System:
Awesome, it feels very good, is easy to use, makes alot right, gives alot of freedome! thanks for this great system and for making it realy cheep so you can build to your hearts content! Amazing!
Story Quest Progress: 
If you let your self into the game you wish to get More of the stories, more of the charakters, like some ""daylie quests"" bring me honey you get a Wing, or bring me an Ant head - I give you a piece of chitin ... just an idea- I loved the way the game progressed you through the map, setting ""targets"" to go for, finding ""bosses"" and finish your ""main mission"" everything went very well! 
Saving System:
I had two issue with the ""save system"" of the game...  
When you Start the game into your world - your pet will Spawn at your Feet, AND you automaticly (or maybe it saves from before quiting) have a weapon in your hand - > I killed my ladybug but clicking  random when the loadingscreen still was tehre and well, I hit my bug q.q rest in piece MuldyBug you carried alot, and now you can carry some clouds in Bughaven xD
The other thing is, if you quit and rejoin, you start at your spawn ... okay ... well but if you disconnect -> that happens too q.q - I understand why it is like that. I just wonder if there was another way to do so.

Settings:
There are settings to make the Game easyer and harder, to change falldamage and  drain. Also there is a setting to change the Spiders with arachnophobia settings to ""bugs"" and if you set it higher you get funny blobbs.

Overall:
Thanks for this amazing Game, I was looking forward to play it and I got what I wanted!  
Thanks! It is a very nice Game!

You can not harvest 95% of the foliage and have to hunt down the few things that you are able to harvest like finding coins in action games. Hopefully they will expand the survival, harvesting and building aspect a lot during the early access. When you do build stuff, the alignment tool for the ground is very aggravating. There should be an auto align feature that will auto align the items to the terrain.

I was unsure of what to expect with it being another Early Access but the price was great for that reason, i'm guessing. Immediately it reminded me of Valheim but I'm pleased to say, forgetting the long boat journeys where friendships were tested, Smalland: Survive the Wilds is better.  Why sail when you can glide and swing your way between Great Trees? Which is another positive for SStW, myself and 3 friends have been jumping between hosting and it really is great that my Great Tree base will come with me along with my pet to their server. Progress is individual based on items so i'm never left behind either. 

I've always loved progression done well. Start a new game and get your ass handed to you by everything then gradually get tougher and usually complacent and get ganked by an even tougher insect round the next bend.  The game doesn't take you by the hand in where to find resources either. The lore might point you in a direction but you have to look about and really explore to get enough of what you need in some cases.

I really hope the devs keep adding stuff on a regular basis...as much as i loved the other game, i got bored waiting on updates that mattered and Smalland: Survive the Wilds has so much potential.  Tough combat (especially solo) with several different weapon/damage types make it worth every penny and satisfyingly creepy atmospheres when you get caught out at night, your torch breaks and you end up on ground level make it even more fun to play with friends.",1681655363,1681655363,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The short of it being, if you enjoy sandbox style games and also like insect, this game is worth the price of admission.

Pros: The game operates very well for early access and 3rd and 1st person work great. Neither seem like an after thought. 
Its a beautiful game with amazing renderings. Its will not blow your mind but for the price point and content it looks great. Dawn is actually quite breathtaking if you immerse yourself abit. 
Building and crafting function great. You can build a lot of different types of buildings by rotating building pieces. Building for me also felt easy.
The insects in the game look spectacular, almost too good.
Equipment looks really cool and I enjoyed finding all the materials and experimenting with different sets to see which one was most effective.
Death is very forgiving. When you die you drop a tomb stone with all your belongings in it. Just run back and get your stuff even if you die on the way there your tombstone will remain.

Cons: Combat is not complex. You CAN dodge and block enemy attacks but doing so requires a great deal of stamina. The easiest way to combat most enemies comes off as more of an RPG approach. Better gear can make or break later combat. Dodge only seems effective if you are escaping however some enemies have terrible detection and you can simply sidestep around them to avoid being hit.
Pets you can tame later in the game which range from lady bugs to spiders die way to easy and getting another can be troublesome if you are not in possession of the items required to tame them.
Your character can not swim in any kind of water that goes above their heads. At first I thought it was the rushing river that was doing me in but later I fell into a pool of stagnant water and slowly watched my character drown without in resistance. I feel like your character should be able to at least tread water or make it operate like gliding. Swimming depletes stamina until you are out and THEN you drown.

Overall the game is fun and I recommend it wholeheartedly. Its a sandbox survival game with giant insects, cool looking visuals and great pacing.",1681655015,1681655015,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Of course it is similar to other survival games. You have to gather food, resources, etc. to survivve and progress in the game. And you are TINY but not some dumb kid like in a certain other game that tried to be smalland before smalland existed. You get to DESIGN your own character, and seems to be able to even design MULTIPLE characters to switch between.

I think my only issue with the game... is the bees, ants, hornets, etc. in the game.
You see, they all sting you (well at least the bees and wasps/hornets), and while it is true the majority of them CAN sting irl as well, MALE WASPS/BEES/HORNETS can physcially not sting as they irl don't have a stinger. Males of these species (also go for male ants) do not have stingers. Stingers are ovipositors, and ovipositors are EGG laying devices. Most male animals do not lay eggs, that is primarily a female thing.

but yeah, aside from that, the game is pretty fun. The aggressive insects get easier to deal with once you get better weapons (duh) and with some armor, even just the stone ones, you can actually stand up to most of the normal enemies. I have not yet went up against any of the boss insects so I don't know if it is very effective against the bosses, BUT, for most of the other insects, the stone armor works just fine.

all in all, yes, this game is definitely worth it. Very fun, A+. Love chopping down strawberry plants and mushrooms, and stealing blackberries from beetles and honey from bees. Very fun!",1681519718,1681519718,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Good enough map to explore and good enough crafting system for now.  Having fun exploring and finding all locations, npc's and materials.  The PVE combat against all types of enemies is not as rewarding and a bit clunky so far.   I hope this gets worked on.  The hits don't feel like they are connecting enough.  We're missing a bit of things like stunning the enemies or just hitting them so hard they slide back or fall down or something.  Even that should happen to us.  The combat shouldn't just be about hitting and getting hit until one of us is dead, make it more interesting, add stuns, knock backs, falling down, anything else you can think of.
Now about those huge storms...just normal rain outside except some shaking, a bit of thunder sound and flashes and this annoying message to stay inside during storms with this music.. Would be fun to actually feel there's a super storm outside, seeing maybe huge water drops risking of killing you or something.  In a survival game, I should learn to stay inside by myself and the game should communicate only through visual effects to warn me something is coming or is causing me pain. All players can learn that by themselves or else you could add an option for tutorial mode to help those that need assistance (can be just a popup  on anything new that happens to you or that you just crafted or looted).  I hope you plan to give this game a better visual experience as the development goes.   The scenery is awesome but missing a bit of variety, needs more hidden locations or special items to find.  The map still looks good, but could be so much better i'm sure.  Sorry, played a lot of Valheim and Grounded and expecting so much from any survival game so I want to reply it often.

I've been weary of EA games in the past, but a competitive game to grounded was something I was going to jump on in a heartbeart. Downloading/playing the game felt wonk/clunky right off the bat. 10+hrs in and I've already stopped playing - the game feels like it's way too far from a good EA release from what I want. The UI/Inventory system still has a lot of bugs when it comes to swapping hotbar items or moving things between inventory and hotbar. The enemies felt like borderline dark souls bosses, which was actually very cool, but once you learn the mechanic you farm it for some resources and never return really. After you get the current end game upgrades there's not much more to the game in it's current state. Sure you can visit other treehouses, create a base and what not, but the overall story was super linear and almost pointless. The map just doesn't feel as involved as it could, you typically just run to and from location, occasionally looting things and maybe killing one enemy. Easter eggs or lack their off removes any sort of unique connection or relationship outside of the game.

I'm genuinely sad, it's a lovely little game, but I don't see me returning to it until it's out of EA after they've added the next two major upgrades they have in plan. In it's current state I wouldn't recommend this game, especially at the price.

Pros:
One very beautiful and well crafted environment! Getting lost is easy but very rewarding, dangerous and fulfilling! I had more fun exploring and finding secrets and new places, fighting or running to stay alive than other aspects of the game! 

Building is nice and on par with other games and your main base (given you built it in a great tree) can be relocated once you find another great tree and claim it. I like the art style of building a little better in Smalland compared to others.

Interactive weather systems. Depending on where you stand with this mechanic, it is still new in Smalland and not completely fleshed out yet. It works, but theres other things sort of missing making it more complete. However, atm, racing to find shelter during a severe storm can be a bit annoying but gets the blood pumping as well! Storms do cause resources to spawn faster so there is a purpose, but also a negative. Im used to it now and I dont think the game would be as fun without it.

Quite a few things but they need fleshed out more, especially in QoL features.

Cons:
Janky combat but works and gets the job done.

Needs more options to play the way you want (ex. dev commands, cheat codes, console commands, creative mode, etc)

Drowning. I get it, but theres gotta be a way to be able to traverse water. Theres a lot of large bodies of water on the map. Not having anything to traverse them or small creeks becomes really annoying for now.

More QoL features like character space, storage space, being able to stack items past 30 (really annoying), etc, etc... I assume these things will be fixed soon and expanded upon but really shouldve been there upon EA release. 

All in All:
Worth the price of admission and theres been a few small improvements made to the game concerning QoL and bugs already since release (but more is needed). Looking forward to new content soon as well.

I wandered around picking flowers, fighting off unruly ants, and tamed my first grasshopper. The progression felt natural, the resources were interesting and diverse, the combat was interesting without being overbearingly difficult, and with good preparation and care, I felt well equipped to handle the formidable challenges set by the devs. 

After defeating the first boss in a (somewhat simple) boss fight, I was sent off to the Swamp biome. I went in, started gathering the materials there, and set up a little base of operations with a spawn point near where I had entered. As it turns out, the spot where I entered is nowhere near where the devs have decided you should enter and exit the zone. After getting in a little over my head with a pair of Black Widows, I died and re-spawned in my hut. Thus began a 40+ death loop, attempting to exit the zone. The Swamp is divided from the rest of the map with sheer cliffs, meaning I had to run a gauntlet of over 20 deadly creatures, terrifying terrain, and impossible odds to have any hope of continuing my playthrough. Being unable to leave and unable to gather any of the resources there without my gear, I was left with a sword, completely broken armor, and an army of Black Widows between me and my base. 

(UPDATE) After a bit of looking around, there is a sort of protection to salvage a save game in this scenario. I was able to load my world with Peaceful Mode, and turn off creature aggro. This allowed me to walk back home, get my backup gear, reload in normal mode, and fight my way back to my main backpack. With this, I am back to enjoying what is overall a quite enjoyable game!

This setback was pretty demoralizing, and almost had me uninstalling the game, so I believe a bit of work could be done on the limited access to the Swamp biome. Maybe limiting the entry points as well as the exits, so people do not enter for the first time at an impossible distance from the exit. 

You guys are absolutely killing it with the game overall, and the experience (up until the Swamp) was smooth and beautiful.

I understand this mechanic and I have no issues with it, however,  it is extremely unforgiving and i could be right next to the shore and cant move fast enough to just walk out. I also lost a backpack because the area it was left was floating directly above the water... So it was impossible to claim because I would just die immediately. 

Then I went to use the bed and I just got stuck there. Thankfully they do have an ""unstuck"" button (which also drops your entire inventory so make sure you do not use the unstuck unless you have zero options because you will likely be unable to retrieve items. I rarely do reviews and I am very patient when it comes to early access games. I know full well there will be bugs but the shear number of progress halting bugs I experienced in less than an hour is alarming. I am going to continue but I am wary because I do not want to be many hours into the game and experience more bugs that erase current progress.

You play as some sort of ""Smallfolk"" and if you don't know what that is, imagine PeterPan's Tinkerbell, minus the wings, pixie dust, the flying, a skin tone ranging from albino to dark elf and still  smaller in size.  

The game has a story line with some NPCs that kind of give you a quest line to follow.  While there isn't really a shopping experience, you can have most NPCs craft armor for you.  It's the only way to get armor in fact.  The game is crafting, survival, foraging, base building with more base building, and more base building in multiple locations.  The graphics and scenery are beautiful.  There's hardly any waiting for loading a game, like 10 secs maybe and I didn't have any performance issues.  The enemy creatures can be intimidating in size as you progress in the game, and has some souls like gameplay.  It might be just me, but I have issues with the character not rolling sometimes.  I know that I have the stamina for it, it just doesn't register.  I have my keys mapped different for how I play, so the mouse middle wheel button seemed like a good idea.  I know its early access and it does seem like they left this off on a slight cliff hanger, but I don't really like the food system.  You can gather all these ingredients to make food that fills your hunger up to 70 vs the standard 30 points ( out of 100 )...but thats all it seems to do, for now anyway.  I have no incentive to really want to build/use those foods because the 70 or higher nourishment level will actively cause health regen....so waiting to get your nourishment level to 30 to make the most of a meal that gives you 70 nourishment means from 30-69 nourishment, you have no health regen.  The Tier 1 cooked foods are plentiful/easy to forage/make and gives you 30 nourishment.  Maybe if the tier 2 and Tier 3 cooked foods gives other stat boosts like, poison resistance, damage resistance, fall damage resistance etc etc...then the higher tiers become worth it, but far as I know, its only nourishment points.

The other con is the unstuck option.  That option will essentially kill you, and you respawn at your bed, presumably leaving your inventory at your gravestone death spot.  If your stuck, and you want your inventory, then that means you have to get back to that spot and get restuck again to get your inventory back.  Case and point, Lisandra, its possible to drop down on the rib cages above/behind her ( thats how I found her ), but I fell through the rib cage and there is an invisible wall that won't let you get out and it was pain, like 30 minutes trying to jump out of there, because once you magically jump back ontop, the ribcages aren't a solid structure, so you can't walk on them with out falling through again, jumping from ontop had a limited height before you hit some sort of ceiling, and kinda jumping and sticking a landing on the next rib was difficult without falling back down to the ribcage trap.

These cons are fixable....there are probably others like lack of a fast travel or the tames die super easy, but those for me weren't an issue.  I used the quit and start game to fast travel back to my bed after a long expedition or destroy my current bed quit and start game to fast travel back to beginning of the game.  Tames, I really just didn't use or need, but thats all I could really think of after playing every day for the past week and finally unlocking the chest.  It's been a game, that I can't put down, and when I realize what time it is was or how late it is, I'm amazed how easily I was immersed in this world.  I look forward to the devs adding more content or the community creating mods and more content.

Most players seem to overlook the frame rate drops and focus instead on the survival aspect of the game. However, I simply cannot because this sort of poor optimization breaks immersion for me. With an RTX3080 and i9 processor, I was getting constant stuttering and massive frame rate drops in 4k resolution with all graphic settings lowered and even the resolution modifier to around 60%. I believe this is due to the Unreal Engine 4 shader compilation stutter that cannot be fixed with any graphic setting and requires optimization from the developer, which may or may not happen. Gameplay also feels aimless and grindy with little to no direction what to do or where to go. You mostly just run around gathering resources, crafting, and getting killed by overpowering enemies and even water until you encounter several boss battles where you will most assuredly die if unprepared. And when you die, you lose everything in your inventory and are then forced to traverse the map to the spot where you died and hopefully locate your missing items.

https://youtu.be/ciSaNmoSR5Y

Bashing beetle heads, slashing ants, cutting geckos, riding hornets, great names for heavy metal bands and also activities in this game.

As part of the reasonably named smallfolk you´ll investigate the sudden aggressiveness of your surrounding creatures. You´ll gather resources, arm yourself to the teeth with weapons and supplies to face towering bosses like a rhino beetle or an albino spider.

Crafting the tools to take down the reason why I don´t go outside, can be done by setting up camp either on skyscraper like trees or down in the field amidst your foes, with an intuitive building UI and a smart radar to identify the necessary resources. 
Other materials are harvestable by clearing the garden of those pesky insects, so lets take a look at the combat.

With weapons like spears and swords you´re equipped with a light and heavy attack on the mouse buttons, a completly underwhelming block and a far too weak dodge roll. Each action consumes stamina, which at the moment is not upgradable amounting to a promising but sadly lacking combat system. With no real weight to attacks and little incentive to block or dodge attacks you often see yourself deplete your stamina bar while trading blows with your opponents, either in third or first person perspective.

Apart from taking your enemies apart you´ll be able to befriend and use them as mules, mounts and fighting companions making your travels through the dangerous world far more comfortable. 
Talking about travels, in Smalland you are also able to craft yourself means to fly over your enemies or swing around like spiderman... there is a joke somewhere in here... however the armor you´ll wear cannot be crafted by your own hands but rather with the help of other Smallfolk. 
These cute encounters fill the world with more backstory and characters to interact with, however the main source of social interaction can be experienced in the online mode, with a possible offline singleplayer mode.

With a huge world to explore and numerous enemies to face you´ll spend hours flying and jumping across roots, flowers and rivers and will expierence another survival feature apart from your characters hunger and stamina bar, the weather system.
Constant danger from thunderstorms and the occasional season change will result in your character freezing to death, which can be avoided by equipping warmer armor or cook delicious food out of bug meat.

Following the main storyline you´ll be exploring more dangerous areas and enemies like cockroaches, bees and spiders, while constantly obtaining more resources for newer and better gear, which you´ll require to travel more easily through the constantly respawning hordes of enemies. Especially since your currently only way to fasttravel is by exiting the game, which leads you back to your respawn location. This system is far from ideal since you can never pick up your last session from the point you logged out of, while using this as a fast travel seems more like an exploit than an intended feature. 

The current state of Smalland excels with great graphics, an amazing interaction with the world and hauntingly beautiful music. Its fast travel design should be adjusted while the combat system currently falls flat but has more potential than my subscriber numbers.",1681305122,1681305122,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I've finished the game after almost 40hrs and had fun overall. Yes, it has Early Access problems, but 20 bugs (in sale) are okay.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Hands down, this game looks awesome! The world is beautiful, the armor sets look cool and the base building parts match the theme very well and harmonize with each other. I really like the art style overall, but the character model is just 'okay'. 
You don't see your character ingame (not even the antenna) because of the full body armor without the option to hide the helmet. 
The environment is full of life, we even have storms and seasons, which I really like. And no, they do not 'come out of nowhere'.

[u]'Story' and Quests[/u]
The first big downside is the 'story'. A survival game doesn't neccessarily need a story, but if you decide to put some in it, then please develop it. We have no clear beginning, no common thread, nothing. All we get is ""my key got stolen. In this chest we have the elixier we need for our queen. Go find my key."" [spoiler]I still can't figure out how that big bug could steal a key without anyone noticing it.[/spoiler] The NPCs that helps us to find the thief have no story at all. All we get here is ""I have problems with this boss monster. Go kill it for me, thanks"" Again, you do not need a story in survival games, but the devs decided to add one and failed hardly. For me, it could have been enough to have some background story of the smallfolk or why the world doesn't have any giants anymore. [spoiler]For example, why is there a big sceleton in the swamps? Lisandra could have some background knowledge about it, but well...[/spoiler] 
The quest rewards after killing the bosses are questionable. Okay, I get a receipt how to craft a kibble to tame an animal, but why tf do I still need to go the NPC to craft the reward armor? Just give the receipt, I'll do it by myself as well. 

[u]Survival[/u]
The survival aspects are overall fine to me. If your character is hungry, you'll loose health over time and stamina instantly. As long as you're above 70% hunger level, you regenerate health (but way too slow). In winter you need cold resistance armor or warm food to keep yourself warm, otherwise you'll loose health overtime without the possibility to heal it, same during storms. 
There is no buff food or other any other method to miprove your character's skills like cold resistance, improved health regeneration or less stamina drain. 

[u]Controls[/u]
Movement feels smooth, especially flying is really well made. Movement during combat is clunky asf. Enemies are way too fast, faster than the sprinting player, which means you cannot flee without taking damage. 
Everything drains stamina, jumping, sprinting, dodging, attacking, gathering. Which itself is okay imo, but the amount of stamina is too high imo. 

[u]Combat[/u]
As mentioned before, combat is clunky. If you decide to simply walk away while the enemy is charging an attack, you'll get anyway, eventho you walked 10meters away. The enemy will glitch to hit you regardless, therefore you have to spent stamina to block/dodge. 
The player is way slower than the enemy, which means to charge an attack results in taking damage or not hitting at all, which feels not rewarding. I don't want to fight taktical the whole time, I don't wanna play Dark Souls. 
Because of that, combat get annoying over time. This and the aggro radius. Enemies will chase you way too long and way too fast. 
The system of different weapon types is fine to me, although I don't like to play with a hammer. To have a shield for the second hand would be awesome or the possibility to hold two different one-handed-weapons.

[u]Multiplayer[/u]
Another big downside is the multiplayer, because it doesn't feel like playing together at all. I guess they will work on this, at least it's on their roadmap. 
I'd appreciate more multiplayer options like more loot (or everyone has their own loot), groups/tribes to play PvP and quest sharing. It's really annoying to beat every boss for many times, because it only drops the reward for one person. 
Additionally, if the owner of the tree base logs out, the whole base is gone which makes is hard for shared bases. But I generally like the idea of having the base connected to the character, so I can transfer my base (including chests, crafting benches) to other player safes.

[u]Base building[/u]
As mentioned before, you can transfer your tree base to other safes, which I like. Besides that, base building is good at the current state. We have 3 tiers that harmonize with each other very well. The amount of different parts is good for early access but has potentional for more decoration parts like carpets and lamps. 
The grind for the stone parts is heavy, but okay. 

[u]Questionable decisions[/u]
1. As a keyboard player I'm lowkey mad that I only have 8 tool slots. I don't know any other game where I have less than 10? In the beginning and midgame you need at least 3 different weapons and 3 different tools. Only 2 left. If you decide to go for ranged weapon, only one left. At least give me an option to create sets so I can easily swap between a fighting set and building/gathering set. 
2. The inventory and stack sizes are way too small. Only 30 or 20 per stack? We had 50 in pre-alpha, what happened? 
3. What exactly is the point of the tannery? You can craft only one piece. 
4. Durability. Everything above 75%(?) can be repaired for free, but we never really know when we hit the minimum durability before we need materials. Additionally, it's ridiculous how often how have to repair your tools. Chop 5 trees, then repair, repeat. Really annoying.

[u]False advertising[/u]
1. Taming: taming is useless. Your pets are way too weak, they can be easily beaten by the night ants or grey flies. Also ,you can only tame ONE animal at the same time. In the trailers, the taming system looked way better, but it's just bad. 
2. Armor: In the trailers they showed, specific armor prevents you from getting aggro. Just wear the black hornet set and hornets will let you in peace, but that's clearly false. Everything will attack you, doesn't matter what you wear. 
(3. owl: Where is the owl?)

[u]Bugs[/u]
1. The most game breaking bugs I faced were dead spaces. Sometimes you end up stuck anywhere without any way out. Yes, you can 'unstuck' yourself but you just die at this location. Just set the character 30s back (or to last safe point). If you decide to jump off a cliff after getting stuck there, your tombstone will be at the point where you jumped, not where you died. Good luck getting your stuff back without getting stuck again.
2. Translations are off for German. 'Unstuck' doesn't mean 'gelockert', it means 'befreien'. 'Webstuhl &amp; Spindel' and 'Sprache &amp; Bedienungshilfen' have some questionable additions.  

[u]TL:DR[/u]
As an early access title, Smalland delivers. You have enoughto do for ~30hrs, a beautiful world to explore and base building is fun. Even for early access we don't have many game breaking bugs and the tree base system is refreshing imo. Downsides for me are the unfair combat (enemies are way faster than you), bad story and undeveloped multiplayer. Some game decisions are also questionable (you cannot craft armor by yourself, you need to go to the NPCs) or unbalanced (repair system). 20€ (in sale) is totally fine for the currewnt game state imo.

___The positives___

This game is beautiful, the world design (for the most part) is great. The story (despite the lack of spoken dialog) is interesting and gives you a sense of purpose. The freedom given with the building is refreshing. One of the best I've used so far in a survival crafting game. As with any building system, it could be a little better, but I'll take it. The design of the creatures is great. I love the realistic style of the insects. The resource harvesting is perfect and intuitive and makes the whole thing a smooth experience.
 
___The negatives___

Combat

The combat in this game is awful. There is no nice way to put it. The insects in this game are way too fast and deadly way too early on. The dodge is purely aesthetic at this point, and you can't do anything else until your character finishes their entire attack animation. This makes blocking almost completely pointless. Day 1 I am chased by a swarm of ants, 2 beetles and at one point some bees decided to join in, and I feel completely helpless, and the only place to get away at times is into the water. (We'll get to that in a moment). 

EDIT: they have allowed players to adjust the insect difficulty in a recent update, however, the combat itself still needs improvement. The system is wonky and the blocking feels like an afterthought. You are activating an attack animation and the enemies take some damage, but you wouldn't know it as they don't react to your attacks whatsoever. It just feels very dated. There is no way to interrupt either their attack animation, or your own.

Swimming

There is none. You just die when you are in water. It's 2023 guys. Lets get some swimming happening. It would relieve some of the insane challenge from the insects being able to at least put your human shaped body into water. These characters haven't figured out how to swim? I'm not buying it. The surface tension at that scale alone would allow these little guys to float with ease (provided they aren't made out of stone). If you don't want players to go into certain places, just use invisible barriers like you did with the ant holes. Yeah, I can't go in, but I'm still alive. 

World layout and size

It didn't take me long to see the entire map. I had high hopes that the map would be epic. Don't get me wrong, it's cool, but it desperately needs to be expanded upon. Grounded did a really good job at this, making sure you had to acquire certain items to survive certain areas. If they were going for that in this game, it's not obvious. I do understand that they are two very different games though.

These elements really put a damper on being able to enjoy the positive elements of the game. until these things are fixed, I'll be playing something else. 


___Things this game is missing___
 A game like this is just begging to be an epic adventure. It kinda felt a little underwhelming in that department. Some more quests and a leveling system would be fantastic. Your character only gets stronger with better gear. New skills and ability unlocks would be great. I do appreciate the gear upgrades, but the novelty wears off quickly. I'd love to see more lore and story added, and with the advent of AI text to speech, there's little reason to not have great, super realistic spoken dialog, (but that's a matter of personal preference).

The ability to make armor out of every insect in the game. Yes, this is a big ask, but it would allow for greater customization and possible armor based perks. 

Again, the lack of swimming is just confusing and frustrating. I'd take even bad swimming over no swimming.  

___Final thoughts___
I look forward to seeing where this game goes. I really hope this game reaches its full potential. So far it looks promising provided the issues are addressed. Good job devs, I can see you've worked hard on this. I'll be changing my review when these elements are improved.",1680550160,1681280804,False,11,0,0.539967656135559082,0,True,False,True

Satisfactory:
-I do think the world is very immersive. It is incredibility difficult to start out, perhaps too difficult, but it made me want to conquer the world more. 
-The art style is fitting and the map is mostly fun to explore.
-Base building is on par with other games.

Needs Improvement:

Resource Distribution
You really have to travel FAR to get all the resources necessary. Want iron...NW. Want Clay...SE. Oh yeah, you need clay to craft the buildings necessary to use the iron. I guess we are running to the other side of the map because there is no better way to travel. I hope I don't die and I'm now FORCED to respawn back at my base and have to start the trip all over.

Combat
Everyone else has said enough about this. Bad hit boxes, can't cancel attacks, player animations WAY too long, enemies too fast, etc. The only way to really make progress is to grind better gear and brute force with healing items.
*I do think this will be fixed sooner rather than later tho.

Tree Bases
Never saw the point. Being able to move your base around is cool, but it is so inconvenient traveling up and down the tree constantly. Being able to fly should help.

Crafting
The Building Hammer is useless & annoying. The normal crafting (where you craft the Building Hammer) should just act like the item. We don't need useless items clogging up the quick select. A crafting hotkey is enough.

Armor Crafting
The NPCs shouldn't have to craft every armor for you. This is very inconvenient for the player. All armor NPCs should have the player perform a quest, then after they perform the quest, they give you the RECIPE for the armor, which you can craft on your own. Then it feels like an achievement, rather then ""I have to go ALL THE WAY back there for 1 extra protection?"" (Whatever that means).

Armor in General
Most armor in the game is basically the same. Only slight improvements that don't mean much, but requires TONS of different resources that you need from all over the map to craft. Why does the Silkweave armor not protect from Poison? Why is the Healer armor so grindy? Where is the early armor, like a ladybug or butterfly set? Why is there no improvement from the Bee Set to Ironwing? Ironwing should have the same flying ability the Damselfly has now. 
Also maybe add a way to customize armor? Lower protection to add movement speed and visa versa, Change the type of protection a set has vs edged/pierce/blunt, etc.
Some new armor ideas from things that already exist in the game:
-Spiked Hornet Armor - Takes stingers & poison glands, glides with wings, damages and poisons enemies on contact from 
  all the spikes sticking out.
-Heavy Chitin Plate Mail - Slows the player significantly but provides elite protection for boss fights.
-Lightweight Leather - More protection and greater speed increase over light armor.

Weapons/Tools
I'll get to the individual tool issues in a second. But I absolutely HATE that you need certain tools to mine different things at all. The starting Pick and Hatchet should be able to mine EVERYTHING. It can take a long time and get less resources, that is fine. Just let the player get things without having to go through a specific progression. It locks out new players from enjoying the game for no reason.
Now to the individual problems - Why is there no Metal Hatchet? Why do so many weapons do ""Edged"" damage, but no metal spear for Pierce Damage? Why is the hammer so slow? Where's the big 2-handed weapons? No Shields? Arrows and bows are all similar and have ridiculous grind for basically no improvement. What is the point of Fire Arrows that don't light anything on fire? Are we serious with how bad the Grapple Hook is?

Lack of Battle Mechanics
Yes there is poison. But where is Bleed? Burn? Wound? Slow? That should be the bare minimum. Then you can do cool things like have Bleeding effects where some enemies deal more damage while the player is bleeding or are more attracted to bleeding players, Slow players down preventing escape or slow creatures to escape easier, Burn damage multiplier on creatures or armor with fur, Etc.

Healing Options
The game needs more potions & a better balancing with the effects. As of now, the simple fiber bandages are all you need for the whole game. They are ridiculously cheap, counter poison no problem, and are borderline superior to health elixirs. Balance it with different items healing different ailments, such as bandages only healing wounds and not poison damage. Add different effects like gashed wounds that would need a higher tiered bandage to fully heal or the player is slowed, etc.

Recipes
All of the food recipes at each tier are essentially the same. Like the fiber bandages, mushrooms are fine as a food source all game. There is an opportunity to have different food options heal or help different ailments. Right now some foods grant cold protection, others could easily grant burn, bleeding, or poison protection. 
No speed potion? Damage potion? Stealth potion? Molotov cocktail?

Creatures
Variety at launch is fine, but...
Mice/Rats, Snakes, or Hummingbirds anyone? Don't get me started on Praying Mantis, Assassin Bug, Scorpions, Centipedes...a lot of missing potential here.


Unacceptable:

The biggest problem - The Inventory
Way too small (no pun intended). Stacks for EVERY resource needs to be 50+ at minimum. Only keys 1-8 for quick select...there are 2 more numbers on the keyboard, add 2 more slots. The quick select is also frustratingly integrated into the inventory and causes everything to move around when you equip new tools/weapons so it is impossible to keep organized. 

***Separate the quick select from the inventory slots, make it 40 inventory slots (50 total including quick select), and make 50+ stacks for everything. Don't punish the player for gathering resources.

Character Customization
Currently there is no way to customize or improve the player character over time, other than obtaining new weapons & armor. XP gain from farming resources, crafting, & killing creatures NEEDS TO BE ADDED so the character can gain levels. This way, the player can add points earned from level gain to increase their Health, Nourishment, Stamina, Movement Speed, Melee Damage, Fortitude (weather protection), etc. over time to customize their character. Special traits or talents to improve in different areas of combat further would also be welcome.

Lack of Fast Travel
ARK got this right.
Fast travel needs to be added between different bases. This can be linked to a specific bed (gives more reason to use better beds). For fast travel, just don't allow the player to take anything with them other than the armor they are wearing and held item (same as death). Everything else is dropped.
When you die, there should be an option each time to decide at which bed on the map to spawn at. This can be balanced by using the beds as different tiers: Basic bed is a single spawn only. The next bed is a permanent spawn point. 3rd bed is permanent spawn & allows fast travel between them.
This can all be balanced by giving gravestones a time limit before they disappear forever.

Taming
All the other reviews on this are correct. It is pointless to tame anything. Only 1 tame is allowed at a time and they don't do anything. Taming needs to be integrated into the gameplay much more. Specific mounts should be designed for killing, resource gathering, traveling, etc. Right now you get the only flier AFTER you beat all the content and it can't climb cliffs with its 2 seconds of stamina. This doesn't need to be ARK, but come on...we need a way to get around better than this. Bare minimum is a reliable flier to get around the map, but I'm really waiting to hop around on that Toad (Just make sure it takes no fall damage and can survive the water).

Game as is, I wouldn't recommend.
I feel like most of the good reviews for the game are hoping for something better in the future, or were paid to leave a good review.
That being said....


TLDR: Just feels like they didn't even test their core aspects in the game.

Pros:
1) Really beautiful game
2) Building currently.. is on par with most survival building games

Cons:
1) **Worst Gripe about the game** Durability is a laughable joke, like what even.. who tested the durability of things and said, ""yep a-okay"". Why would you ever upgrade from a wooden sword, unless you plan to carry around the Material for a work bench to repair your weapon after literally EVERY fight.. 

2) Combat is clunky, You swing at an enemy next to you and miss, yet the enemy attacks from 50ft away and hits you. If you plan to block, you have to stop everything your doing and wait a good 2 seconds and time it perfectly, because the animation isn't accurate.

3) Players are expected to travel wayyyy far south, past pretty tough enemies, to find Flint and Bark on the Beaches.. however, most enemies don't ever give up the chase, unless you find some where to cheese them. Once on the beach you can only mine Flint at first because Bark requires Flint tools, and good luck finding Seeds to make Seed oil, and refine wood.

4) If you're playing alone, in your own world.. you cant pause.!?!? Why.. 

What would help the game currently?

1) Pausing in single player worlds
2) Durability fixes for all tools and weapons
3) A better map, with clearer paths wouldn't hurt..

Here's to hoping the game gets better with future patches & updates.",1680145594,1681239333,False,658,42,0.782533049583435059,0,True,False,True

so what is the point of all of what i mentioned above and is the game worth buying and playing?

well... the point is that yes, the game is good. but the game is very VERY incomplete. yes, it IS early access but i know a lot of early access games feel like they should be released already. this is not one of those games yet.

should you buy/play it? if you have the money and wanna chill for 15-30ish hours trying out something new, sure. if you don't like the idea of playing an incomplete game then wait til it launches (or is at least closer to launch). but overall, the game does look like its going to be a very fun survival game when it is more fleshed out.

Smalland is an amazing survival game for anyone who fell in love with or grew up on the old movies. I did a solo playthrough and was not disappointed. After purchasing this game on day one I dove in and immediately became immersed. The world is beautiful and the controls are smooth, this was enough to keep me playing. The building in the game is reminiscent of Grounded and Valheim but it has it's own flair that is also unique to Smalland's world.

If you are on the fence, I would recommend giving this game a chance. The developers are attentive and quickly address player issues and are adding to the game fairly consistently. I'm excited for the future of this game. It really is a lot of fun. 10/10 so far",1681169622,1681169622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

768200,136495176,76561198140394739,215,85,1253,0,1253,1681162954,"I want to be able to recommend this game to other people, but there's just so much jankiness and disappointment here that I have to say, don't get this game until MANY things change. I gave this EA game one hell of a chance before it earned the thumbs down too, believe me. 

So the main thing that separates this game from Grounded is the mounts, the unfortunate part about that is every single mount in this game is more disappointing than the last. Grasshopper is decent and then its all down hill from there, which is pretty sad given that some of the mounts are supposed to be ""rewards"" for beating a boss. I say supposed because the gecko mount struggles to crawl up walls, which is literally its power, the spider cant climb up walls or jump so its speed doesn't make up for horrible traversal ability, so its pretty meh too. The thing that solidified my thumbs down though is the damselfly. You have to beat the current final boss to get it, and then it didn't even have enough stam to fly me over a tiny pond where i tamed it, so it just fell in and killed us both. Kind of a fitting end to my play through tho. A game with a lot of promise slowly disappointing me over and over. This is game needs to be balanced for fun, and its balanced for??? I literally don't even know... because PVP isn't going to be the main draw here. For frame of reference, the damselfly is significantly worse than the worst Ptera I ever flew on in Ark. 

So at this point its worth mentioning you cant swim in this game. Water kills you, so these devs are seriously missing out on an entire biome that would be such a joy to play in. So they can't get mounts right, and there's no swimming... I think you know what I'm going to say... Just buy Grounded instead. 

So that was the main reason I can't recommend this game in its current state. For those of you that like to read:

The good: pretty world, fairly worth investigating, will probably get more stuff that's worth seeing. Fixed time of day issue on patch one by adding server setting sliders (please add more). 

The bad: Very limited enemy types, and resource drops are very limited and extremely redundant which takes the joy out of killing something new. The ""rewards"" aren't rewarding (only exception is gaining glide). NPCs bare bones AF, and most armors they offer are not worth crafting or even thinking about, some armors even give you speed penalties? Seriously, in a game where going places you've already been is the least fun part of the game??? Take anything that doesn't let you get from point A to point B in a way that's fun and get rid of it.

The jank: Stamina is ruining the fun the fastest, and thats for the player and their mounts. It's current state is frustrating and needs to have its drain rate halved for everything, only with potions is stam barely tolerable. You can't make it night time, and fireflies only spawn at night, so you  have to wait if you need firefly juice. Walking everywhere blows so I felt compelled to turn the game onto peaceful mode just so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time going from A to B. I really really really doubt this game was built around mounts, or they would function better, and that just makes me wonder, did they really intend for this much walking? Glide should be given as base kit and the wings should let you f'n fly. It truly feels like the devs dont know what it means to have fun in a survive with your friends game. My advice is the devs should go play some Ark and then worry even less about balance than they do because that game actually has to consider PvP, until this game has dedicated serves, its just a casual game and should be balanced as such. 


The Missing QoL: Grounded did not release with half the QoL it has today, so I don't super care about this stuff not being in the game RN, but it really should be added eventually. Sleep From Day to Night and not just sleep only at night. You're work benches should have access to the supplies inside of them so you don't need to pull stuff from them to craft. If you are going to let me attach chests to walls, I need to be able to do it from angles that make sense and not just handle side only sticks to walls. 

There MUST be a way to teleport home eventually, even if its something I have to craft, because if they think that having a tree house where you have to ride a slow slow sloooow elevator up every single time to get home, is better than making fobs when you need to move locations and taking your important stuff with you... they are flat wrong. Actually right now the best thing to do is quit and come back, which turns every trip into a one way trip because you always spawn into the world at your spawn point you've set. If quitting the game in order to save myself a crap walk back and stupid balloon ride doesn't SCREAM rework, idk what does. 

So yeah, I'll definitely be keeping an eye on the patch notes, because I believe all of my issues can be fixed and I truly hope one day I am compelled to change my review.",1681164767,1681165413,False,2,0,0.503448307514190674,0,True,False,True
768200,136494034,76561197976043137,1114,72,1605,0,961,1681265290,"This is very much an early-access, early-impressions review: there is the skeleton of a VERY good game here, with a lot of great ideas, but I think the implementation/execution of those ideas needs some tuning. Since it's in early access, I have some hope that it'll eventually get there. It's a very charming setting with charming music and an intriguing start to the story, so I'll be cheering it on and hoping for the best!

Before I elaborate at all, let me say that my ideal standard these days for a survival/combat/crafting/building game is probably Valheim, so when I imagine a game really nailing the experience, that's what I think 'nailing it' looks like. If you don't care for that game, you may not feel the way I do about anything else I'm about to say! The game has a lot of GREAT things going for it -- full-refund build pieces, decorative lighting that doesn't need to be refuelled, a whimsically awesome build-piece selection, the intense storms, the visual style, the music, the neat basic premise and intriguing story idea, the mobile tree bases, etc -- but I'm going to focus from here out on the things that feel rough.

I think the early game is really tedious. There are a bunch of ways that things could be tweaked to make it feel like it drags less, but currently I think there are things that compound the issue. 

Reliance on fiber early-on is painful; you will need far and away more of this resource than absolutely anything else, a bit like Valheim's dreaded copper grind...but with the addition of 9000 combat encounters with ants to deal with, as opposed to your occasional greyling fight. 

That might be okay if combat was a joy, but in its current state I don't even find it fun most of the time. You're given a dodge roll and a block, suggesting that the aim was to have maneuverable, action-oriented combat, but neither one of those moves is worthwhile in practice, because you get locked into all of your animations so you can't block or roll immediately after an attack, nor can you attack immediately after those moves. Enemy recovery time is such that rolling doesn't create any opportunities to attack at all. By the time your roll finishes you're right back in the situation with an enemy that you were in before you initiated it. I found that against non-boss enemies the most effective strategy is definitely 'stand there and whack it until it dies first' -- but you won't reach that point until after you get flint tier tools.

The game didn't even feel like a proper survival/crafting/building game for me until I unlocked flint tier stuff, at which point I suddenly felt capable of obtaining resources at a reasonable pace. Until that moment, I was constantly asking myself if I was even having fun. There's a huge amount of walking around--the terrain forces you to circle around things, as you're not capable of cutting straight across a the very vertical landscape early on--and the map is really beautiful, making you want to explore it...but the frequency of combat encounters makes it a slog, taking up a chunk of time compounded by the weakness of your kit. Even after the first boss, having tamed myself a mount, I was disappointed to find it almost hampered my mobility more than just walking around would've.

So you need loads of resources, have tools that take ages to obtain them, on a (very beautiful) map that takes ages to traverse, smothered in small-time enemies that aren't especially fun or engaging to fight, and on top of that you have durability on your weapons (repairing them is cost-free but only until they've taken a certain amount of durability damage, with the amount being so small that early on you're almost never going to get all the way back to your home base before you've passed it), and you can't make bandages or arrows on the go -- only at your workbench. And you can't make your own armor, either: once you accumulate enough of the pieces, you need to walk your ass all the way out to where a specific NPC makes it for you.

Overall I think there are a number of areas where the game 'taxes' you that just don't feel necessary. Mount stamina/mobility, weapon/tool repair costs, not being able to craft some things on the move, the constancy of combat with hostile insects even in cases where it doesn't make sense (lookin at you, bees). As it is, the combination of factors slows the pace down so much that it feels difficult to make a satisfying amount of progress in a reasonable amount of time...

Unless you turn on peaceful mode.

It kind of galled me to do it. I like combat, usually, and I'm just prideful enough that I don't like decreasing difficulty in the games I play. I just dislike this combat so much, and there's so much OF it, that turning on peaceful mode suddenly opened the game up to me, and I could actually get around to places I needed to go to get things I needed to get, including materials only obtained through a lot of combat encounters with creatures. But if I'd had to do that gathering-combat on top of the random 'getting in the way' combat with everything else, I think I'd have been so sick of it I'd have given up, lol.

Anyway, that's my long, rambling impression so far. I'm enjoying the game and see so much potential here to attain the compulsively-playable status of a game like Valheim! I think it just needs some tuning and balancing before it gets there.",1681163089,1681163291,True,2,0,0.556860029697418213,0,True,False,True

Very little bag space for everything that you need to carry i.e mining tool, chopping tool, bow, different damage style weapons to increase damage done to bugs healing bandages leaving like 10 slots to actually farm materials.

Second thing combat very clunky blocking is pointless due to the slow animation. better off just wearing better armor and just swinging and heal after.

graphics are very mediocre nothing to rave about. obviously game has some slight optimization issues due to it being early access but it is at least playable.

After putting in the time to beat all bosses obtain the key and spend some time roaming around. The game needs a lot still, food in the game needs more options for what foods can be used for all of them seem to do the same things. Armor needs a rework to many sets that do the same thing and then getting the one that has slightly better protection then the set before has no other added benefit for grinding the materials to obtain the gear. Get rid of the NPC to activate lift to get to tree house once you have claimed it. 

Last annoying thing is taming I have heard rumors of them improving the taming system, but as of right now don't waste the time.

Here you'll see people are complaining about difficulty on both sides.
Those of us who are decent at games find it easy
And those who have only ever played bejeweled or Sudoku find it too hard. 
The latter seems too stupid to use the very nice settings in the option menu to reduce fall damage, enemy damage, enemy health, and even put it on peaceful so nothing will attack you. 

I implore you not to pay any attention to anyone saying it's ""too hard"" these people are stupid.
The game is very easy for anyone with a dark souls or Elden Ring playthrough. You get I frames on your dodge so just roll into the attack and smack then roll out. Very simple. Switch weapon types as needed for max damage or just spear everything. Works fine and has amazing range. 

Traversal is fun. Finding ways around and seeing the sights with it becoming more and more open as you unlock tech. Grasshoppers are weak. But they can jump you clear across the map from the top of a great tree. So jump to where you're going then park your friend on a safe rock as you explore. Then either fast travel back to spawn if you're feeling exploity (Logging back into the game from the menu always places you at spawn)
Or whistle your hopper to your side and jump back manually. Or run back and gather along the way building bridges and stuff. 

The game has multiple ways to play and multiple options. The seasons visibly change the entire game. Combat is fun if a bit too easy. Crafting is sensible.

So much to say, and its all good. 

The Game runs perfect. No crashes, barely a bug... wait.. LOTS OF BUGS.. but the kind you used to be able to step on.. 
Now they step on you.

The Controls are flawless. Fighting is pretty good, running around the map is pretty good, I mean running away from freaking bull ants...

Its tough on your own, but that is fine, you can manage if you learn to be cautious and always watch your surroundings . 
Though I think some boss fights might almost be impossible solo.. ( I just saw the king beetle.. ) and I did see the big ol frog hopping around. ) those could be group worthy.. which is cool I dont expect to solo everything.. that isn't realistic. 

I found a tree south, claimed it. then noticed a massive spider with a dozen babies below it.. FUN! 

I just got the bee suit..(35 hours in) This is essential!!!! and the Tarzan gun!.. forget the name .. but that is really cool. 

The map is made very well. I haven't gotten stuck anywhere yet. The caterpillar rides perfect. I like how everything flows together.. branches, rocks, valleys, swarms of bees..  SO ORGANIC!
The map is really cool. Just the whole idea is very relatable. 

I saw someone complain about the speed of the Bees.. they are fast, but that is perfect.. I just avoid things that are dangerous. 
I don't think you should be able to outrun everything.. you just need to learn to avoid it.. and if not.. well eventually you will be able to destroy them easily.. so enjoy the challenge. 

The building is good, lots of nice stuff.

Everything is pretty damn perfect. 

If there is one complaint.. and its not even a complaint.. 
Its the title. 
Smalland doesn't really scream COOL... Survive the Wild is probably a better name by itself. 
Anyways.. when the name is the only complaint.. they doing something right!

I have combines 4000 hours in Ark, Arma 3 and Minecraft, and many more similar games.. 
So I enjoy the grind. I enjoy working for my stuff, I enjoy not running into people in a small map, I enjoy being sneaky in the multiple layers of nature!!... I enjoy organizing my storage's. I enjoy running back to my dead body 3 times a charm cause nature hates you! 

I just cant believe this game came out of nowhere.. 

Its a worthy challenge for the avid survivalist. 
 
It's early access but you wouldn't know.

""It's like a fun camping trip, but with more blood and screaming!""

Awesome multiplayer survival game that takes you on a wild adventure in a world as a Vanguard, you get to explore a huge open world filled with dangerous creatures, treacherous terrain, and strange ruins.

The game is super immersive, and the graphics and sound effects are top-notch. You get to scale towering trees, wade through giant puddles, and crawl through tiny cracks in the roads. The world is huge, and there's always something new to discover around every corner.

Crafting weapons and armor is a big part of the game, and it's essential if you want to survive. You also get to tame and ride creatures, which is a blast. Building encampments is another crucial aspect of the game, and it's great to have a safe place to rest and store your loot.

One of the coolest things about Smalland is the hidden NPCs scattered throughout the world. They have a lot of lore and knowledge to share, and it's exciting to uncover their secrets.

Overall, Smalland: Survive the Wilds is an awesome game that's tons of fun to play. It's challenging, immersive, and full of adventure. If you're into survival games, you definitely need to check this one out!",1681091864,1681091864,True,11,0,0.599661052227020264,0,True,False,True

I also keep running into doors disappearing from buildings when I change tree tops if the door was left open. For single player, maybe allow us to claim multiple tree tops and build on all?

-No auto sort for inventory
-No auto drop into/out of chests
-Work stations require you to have all items in inventory, they dont pull from chests
-No option to turn off loot drop on death
-Stack sizes are small 
-Items break down quickly and you spend much time hunting down materials just to repair gear

This results in the player spending way too much time doing inventory management instead of playing the game. Come on guys, its 2023; we have the technology.

When you're finally done organizing your inventory and you're ready to set off into the world, the mounts you can chose from are all annoying to ride.

Pros:
- building works well, enough structure pieces available, ability to claim a tree and have your base travel with you between SP/MP is a good idea and works well
- progression structure
- large enough world
- npc ""quests"" are a cool touch, wish it was expanded upon, with more diversity/multiple stages
- mounts
- seasons

Cons:
- not enough content to keep playing (for now, since its early access)
- needs QOL improvements, mainly for storage (renaming chests, auto pull from chests when crafting at base, etc)
- exploration is ok but im missing more content here in the form of tunnels, caves, ruins etc to explore and be meaningful. most things end up in nothing but a dead end with maybe some resources there.
- please make running while out of combat not drain your stamina bar. there is really no point in having the bar drain, interrupt your run, only for then to almost instantly fill again.

Couple thing that could be awsome.

1. a progression system similiar to grounded where u find like mutation that boost your character and improve your gameplay.Doesnt need to be level but a progresion system in survival is kinda mandatory.i played all the big survival games like ARK/Conan/Empyrium/grouned etc and they have something in that area.
2. more secret things like receipe/blueprint for base building or rare weapons etc
3.More POI with interesting stuff


Pros
Great world
Great graphic
Good combat could be better


Cons
Durability lost  on everything need to be tune down by 100% easy its too much right now.
Some monsters agrro and chase u half the map so it might be a little much.


Overall great game and looking forward for future update.I would recommend this game right now

[h1] Good Points 👍 [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Really beautiful graphics and the game runs smooth.
    [*] Beautiful handcrafted map
    [*] Big variety of different insects and biomes to explore.
    [*] Gliding and Grappling Hook makes traveling the world fun.
    [*] You can tame creatures to be your pet.
    [*] Beautiful and satisfying Building system.
    [*] Interesting lore actually makes me wonder what happened to Humans.
    [*] I have not really encountered any bug.
[/list]

[h1] Bad Points 👎 [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The game is pretty short lived, once you killed the bosses there isnt much to do anymore, until they add Pvp.
    [*] Bosses are too easy to defeat, using decent armour and spamming bandages and in case requiring posion resistance seems you can defeat most of them by just spamming attacks, some of them have a special attack which is really slow but does a lot of damage but might hit you the first times but you can get the dodge timing very easily.
    [*] Currently there are no better tool to cut wood than Flint Axe which is very slow.
    [*] There are no really any events that endangers your base like swarms of insects so Building is entirely cosmetic and nothing else, which for a Survival game I do not like, I rather having to defend my home from external threats as I consider is motivating to build more and better.
    [*] Even if you can tame creatures they do not really give any big advantage to have at all, it seems their best use is to keep them at home for cosmetic purposes rather than just going out with them and they get killed out of nowhere in matter of seconds.
    [*] Currently there is very small ammount of content and as I said after you killed the bosses you will stop playing the game pretty much, most likely with PVP updates and adding more content and adding events like forcing players to fight for some special resource avaliable for a short period of time or adding seasional bosses that give some rare loot that players can compete and stuff like that will make the game something else.

For a genre that is saturated I appreciate the attention to detail, the gorgeous graphics, the fun and playful nature of being shrunk down, and more attention to building and gearing up to prepare for harder monsters (namely bugs!) and areas. In all too many games you can rush right through the game. I feel in Smallands it really is worth it to take your time and set up a minimal base to get started, then start collecting resources to improve on the base and build our better crafting tables. For example moving from wooden weapons to flint weapons was life changing. As was harvesting the materials to upgrade my armor. Going from squishy to being able to take a few hits sure made a difference. Likewise moving from twig & leaf structures to wooden structures was a big change!

The concept of the Great Trees and a movable/protected base is awesome. Though I spent the majority of time, until recently with a growing base at the foot of the great Owl. Eventually I outgrew the little space up there near the starting area and built a nice base at the top of a tree.

I love the poke of fun at ""Giants"" with bottlecaps, screws, keys, and random things left around. Seeing their ruins, hanging lanterns and instruments, and other remnants is fun. I've also just shifted from running around with a ladybug companion to a gecko and love the utility to ride but also having a loyal fighting companion at my side!

Build, build, build! For fun, for survival, for utility, and because you can! I've survived many a storm and a winter hiding under a foundation, and a boss fight with my handy three piece lean-to, bed, campfire, and workstation for repairs.

I undertook a massive building project building a series of staircases/ramps from Skadi down to the beach as opposed to the usual route. I'll say this, it is way faster to run the usual route dozens of times than to build the stairs, but oh the fun I've had. Working on several different approaches and mixing in wooden foundations, ramps, and flooring helped me complete the route which is a blast, if not a bit precarious, to use!

PROS:
========
What's done has been done well considering the early state of the game.  So far, it works well on SteamDeck and SteamOS (holo) on PC minus one issue discussed in CONS.

SteamOS
--------
Controls are responsive and the game generally behaves in a correct and predictable manner.
Text is readable, sound is clear, UI elements scale well and are easy to use.
When I did manage to connect (on SteamOS), the connection was stable and the game was responsive.

Windows 10 (LTSC 21H2)
--------
Everything worked as expected consistently minus a couple of map bugs.


CONS:
========

SteamOS
--------
I had network issues on Steam OS.  A friend of mine (on Windows) could not connect to my instance at all.
Connecting to his instance when I'm playing on my Steam Deck was a little dicey at times.  It worked about half of the time.  When it did connect, the connection was stable,

Most notably, if he ended his instance before I had disconnected, I would not be able to reconnect even if restarting my game, Steam, or the computer.  This does not appear to be a consistently reproducible issue on Windows.

Windows 10 (LTSC 21H2)
--------
No significant issues playing the game up to its current conclusion except that there are two spots on the map where you can get stuck.  One is in a hole in a rock near the Matriarch Spider opposite the nearest claimable tree.  The other is on the side of a stone near a brick wall a hornet above--when trying to jump on the stone, I got stuck.  I could reproduce this only twice (and tried many) on Windows.

Building is alright, you have full pieces which snap together that you can rotate to nearly any angle. However, I wish there was more furniture to decorate our homes with. The NPCs have lovely atmospheric spaces and I really wish we could recreate some of their furniture into our own homes.

I'm looking forwards to seeing how the story of this game evolves, it could use some work but what they do have really has me interested.

Needs a little improvement here and there, but incredibly impressive. Not just in visuals, gameplay, but also in content. There is so much to do.

UPDATE:
After playing for a while now I have some more constructive observations.
1. This game in its current state is beautiful to look at, fun to play, challenging, and overall a lovely game experience.
2. There are obviously some things that need to be added/corrected. This being early access that isn't a surprise, but these things are small and not overly bothersome. 

Pros:
Large explore-able world. Very large map with different areas/biomes.
Character customization is lovely
Building in this game is absolutely wonderful! Easy, expansive, with lots of possibilities.
Coop/Online play is smooth and thoroughly enjoyable. 
Very few ""buggy"" spots in the map. Collision issues, getting stuck, and falling through the map is almost nonexistent.
The design and overall appearance of everything is detailed and thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. (Giant spiders are horrifying!)

Cons: 
Pets are almost completely useless. They die at the drop of a hat. The 2 most useful pets are the ladybug for expanded storage and the damselfly as a mount. But they are extremely squishy and friendly fire doesn't apply to them, so they die easily. Really, I only use the ladybug on peaceful because everything attacks it and kills it.

Using the hot air lift is tedious.

Characters stats never level up. No improved health, stamina, or resistances except the little you get from better gear, which is almost nothing. So there isn't really a feeling of progression. You kind of always feel like a low level. The stamina potion does almost nothing, it isn't worth the materials to make it. The poison resist potion is worth it though.

Visiting a friends base is a hassle with no quick way to travel between them.

Gathering is a terrible grind as there is no way to level up to get more resources at once, or expand your inventory. Flint only drops 2-3 at a time for each node. Better gear only makes it go faster with less hits, you never get more. Animals don't help either, so gathering is a long tedious process, even on peaceful mode. 

Overall, great game, even in its current unfinished state. Can't wait for more content and updates. I highly recommend buying it. You won't regret it!",1680415966,1680976157,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I completed the core game as it is right now and look forwards to playing it some more. I enjoyed exploring the map and fighting the bosses as they currently stand. I will just simply say that I recommend it if you like the survival open world genre.

Current core game-play features I think really should be reworked:
Weapons / Tools / Armor
- Durability - I found myself placing down a workbench after every fight, hitting repair 8 times and then demolishing my bench. Rinse and Repeat. In my opinion durability is the most tedious part of survival games. Terraria didn't have it and it has overwhelming positive reviews, take that into consideration. (Personally I'd like to see it removed)
- Armor Variants - Once you have glider you don't use any of the other armors, there's no reason to, kind of sets it up to just have one type of armor that matters and the rest obsolete.
- Shields - Why no shields?
- Dual Wielding - Why no dual wielding? 
- Inventory slots - listen you made it so there was no weight restriction and for that I thank you. Keep it that way. But a backpack or making the hot-bar separate slots, literally anything to open it up just a bit more would be nice.
- Grappling hook - its just awkward to use, could be made better, a move up and down feature would be welcomed.

I know you have these in your road map. But just to touch on them:
- Storms - these should be way more terrifying, think a bugs life with giant rain drops hurling from the sky, as of right now, it just makes you cold which can be fixed by placing down a campfire ... in the rain ... you can probably see the issue there. Or you can literally just make a simple 1 by 1 and hide under anything considered a roof.
- Seasons - Found myself getting cold a lot but never hot / food renders it completely useless to worry about cold / wasn't really fun so to speak. 
- Taming - friendly fire is on towards your tames and they get right in the way, typically just to get 1 shot by your weapons accidental attack. Can't attack while mounted, or use tools, either would be fine just give us an option please.
- Tame Armor- just an idea, would be cool, sort of like with the ladybug having the backpack, gecko could have armor. Just a thought.

- Boss Loot - There's only two bosses in the game that dropped anything of value.
- Swimming - look, its fine that you can't swim and they are death pits, but it needs reworked, personally did not die to water, but came close many times, just kind of avoided it.
- Trees are safe and that's fine, but they are too solid, hallow them out, sprawling inner city's or dungeons you must conquer, make the outsides of them scary with bugs crawling up and down the sides, and idk birds??
- Exploration - There's cool stuff, but nothing cool to do with any of it.

Overall, again I understand its early access, I personally had a great time. But it could use a lot of improvements.

The game still has a long way to go but the devs clearly care and are listening.  In one week they've fixed several things that have improved quality life significantly.  But things like auto-pickup (I can't find/use it if it's in the game - I'm going to break the switch in my E key), closing chests with 'E' randomly switching items in/out of your inventory to the chest, being able to move while in your inventory but still being attacked, or having no items on you but not being able to pickup your gravestone in a single click/keystroke.... These are pretty basic but still need to be addressed.  The game also doesn't scale that well.  It starts off overly hard and a few items in becomes overly easy.  The difficulty between areas just isn't really there and it noticeable.  

That being said - the game is beautiful! And I can't wait for more creatures, items, and areas to be added.  Hopefully a few more patches and the game will be in a much better place.  Teh devs are listening and I love it.

PREV (15hr):This game has too many quality of life issues to be fun to play.  Menu selections and item interactions are really pretty bad (the worst I've experienced in this genre of game).

Setup :

The situation is dire! Food is running low and the Queen is suffering from an unknown ailment.
As a member of the Smallfolk's vanguard, you are tasked with exploring the -now giants free- surroundings, making contact with the brave souls who ventured outside the burrow, and recover the mysteriously missing key to the vault that may save your Monarch.

Gameplay :

While often compared to Grounded due to similar environments, Smallands graphics and story elements feels more like a medieval-fantastic setup.

The game offer most of the mechanics you would expect from a survival game. ( Exploring, gathering food and materials, crafting, building, fighting, ... ).

Like most survival games, progression is somewhat ""tier based"". Gathering new materials will lead to crafting of better infrastructures, gear and consumables and therefor allow further exploration and access to new materials.

There's day/night cycle, seasons and weather. ( Storms are impressive )

Characters and world instances are saved in different files so you can move your toon between your world(s) and your friend's. 
There are also specific places on the map where you can build a base that is linked to your character instead of your map. This allows you to move it both in your world(s) and other's.
You can also build almost wherever you want if you need an outpost or just fancy someplace.

Pros :
- well made graphics and sound design.
- Very few bugs ( but an adequate amount of insects species ).
- The map feels vast and varied enough while not taking too much time getting to one place from another.
- Satisfying amount of content at this point. ( 30-40 hours. More if you are into building )
- Progression is rewarding but never blocking. Some content is locked behind bosses but most isn't. You can always explore and get better gear then come back if you feel stuck.
- Not too grindy. 
- Building feels and look nice. ( Good amount of pieces. Full refund on deconstruction. Ability to rotate pieces on 3 axis)
- The claimable tree system makes farming and moving around less tedious than similar games.

Cons :
- Combat could be improved. ( Too reliant on bringing good gear compared to learning tactics)
- Mounts needs some work. I think they should be either easy to get and discardable or hard to get and rewarding but they are a little in the middle. ( not hard to get but not useful enough to bother)
- The seasons/weather/night system looks great but lacks on the reward vs annoyance side when it comes to game mechanics.
- Could do with better time management options than just skipping nights.

In conclusion, I would ( and did ) recommend Smallands to friends who enjoy survival games.
The amount and quality of the content is above satisfactory for the price tag and the state of the game at the beginning of EA seems promising.",1680910681,1680910681,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I don't like challenge and this game was very difficult for me. With that being said I've just completed all the content that's currently out. If I reviewed this game after my first death it would not have been a good one. I lost all my stuff to the side of a cliff and couldn't get it back.. I had to rebuild everything while starving. It sucked. But I rebuilt and continued to play. The mobs and bosses are hard you need to watch your stamina while rolling and attacking make sure your resist potions are on and you're using the correct weapon they're weak against. You can't really walk away to use a bandage or potion so you have to do it while the boss or mobs on top of you but it's possible. Repair often and it's free, wait too long and it will almost be better to just craft a new set. The water is unforgiving. It will kill you and the mount you road in on. Night is very dark and the mobs are stronger. You have to go to difficult areas to farm mats needed to progress building wise/story wise and gear wise no way around it. Make sure you have cold resist food with you in case there's a storm or the season changes. If you die in winter and need to get your body back. I hope you had extra cold food stored at home because you drop everything except for the gear you're wearing and whatever was in your hand even if it's a pickaxe or building hammer. 

All in all I thought this was a very polished early access game as far as bugs go. The price point felt high for the amount of content currently out even at 22$ but if I had to choose between rushed content and game breaking bugs or less bugs and less content I would rather less content. *EDIT* The bugs I reported originally are already fixed and I didn't experience any of the other bugs some ppl are reporting.

Build a 3 story home at the top of a Great Tree! 

For being similar to survival/monster hunter style game, all of the survival systems are manageable for people with attention issues!!!!  Even if you get up, and walk away from the game, YOU WONT STARVE TO DEATH and be forced to run back to your body! Hunger is more of an opportunity for a bit of health regen if you stay above 70%

 Crafting armor and weapons has 8'ish tiers! Tame a gecko! Craft a wasp suit to glide! Grapple Gun! Swing like Spidey!  5? bosses at time of writing, with huge frogs, and beetles, and spiders to fight!  Nocturnal versions of most monsters are highly aggressive, and their eyes glow in the dark. Super creepy fighting at night! 

And the world IS BEAUTIFUL!  By looking at the in-game map, it appears we have less than 20% of the map that is explorable/built so far. And it is still large enough to take 20 minutes to run from side to side!  Monsters path really well, even finding their own path to get to you. Not glitching or getting stuck, or losing my materials when they die in the occasional odd spot spots. Dodging and rolling feels pretty good so far. I'm bad at Souls sometimes, and this game still makes me feel challenged without being a bully.  Good variety of mobs to fight, each with their own moves and timing. 
( Beware of fighting 2 queen wasps at once. LOL )  

Playing the slow roll, online, building and having fun, it has taken me 40 hours to get to the metal armor ( tier 7 or so? ), and I look forward to seeing you guys in-game! This game is worth the hype it has recieved, and I would purchase this game for my friends. Thanks for reading!

I happened upon this game around the beginning of the launch of Early Access. After watching some of the intros, I immediately knew my little group would enjoy this, and snagged us copies. 

The first day we played together, we put in about 10 hours each. Although it is clear the game is still in Early Access and has a lot to add or build upon, the game is still playable and enjoyable. The Dev team seems to be very active, and have already made some more adjustments to Server settings and some other improvements. 

The game plays similarly to Valheim/Ark, with a Smallfolk/Fey-feel. Our base looks like the Fairy Garden of my dreams, and I am a happy old gnome to have found this game. 

My friends and I are looking forward to logging more hours, and I'm personally hoping the Devs decide to allow Steam Workshop mod integration to allow the fan base to bring their own creativity into the game.  

I am excited to see the new additions indicated on the road-map, and also hope to see more things added, including:
 - Portals (this is just a feature I loved in Valheim, and could integrate with the lore of the Smallfolk living underground and having underground tunnel highways... players could connect their bases to this highway)
 - More Insects/Animals (a bird threat would be TERRIFYING)
 - More tameable Insects, with additional stabling & function (Similarly to Ark's harvesting animals)
 - More questing, or more integrated NPC storytelling
 - Magic elements
 - More underground features
 - Player leveling/progression system (It would be nice to have class options or to be able to build towards a classtype)
 - Waaayyyyyy more decorations! (SIGNS FIRST PLEASE!)

I say that not as a negative but just to let you know what you're getting into. Everything is 'dumbed down' it feels, from resource collection to base building & combat. 'Family friendly', the kinda game you could introduce a young child to the genre of survival games with.

Base building is VERY restrictive, you can only build in the small amount of room atop predetermined trees on the map removing any creativity in location. As for creativity the buildings (Whilst quite beautiful) feel very lacking, especially at the start. A single foundation, wall & floor piece with 15 different roof pieces? Some oversight there maybe....

Combat is little more than left click spam, there is a block feature but it's so unwieldy you're better off without it. Resource vision is awful in my opinion & should be reworked. I don't see any reason you black out all of the lovely textures of the world just because i'm out farming... seems silly. Why not just keep normal vision but highlight resources? Can even put it's own resource bar for using it.

All in all it's a nice little game just not for me, maybe with updates & some restrictions reworked.

This game has land and air mounts, building, crafting, good AI pathing, beautiful environment and a large map.

When starting off you might find it pretty difficult to take on fights with most of the creatures, but just keep at it unlocking more tools and armor and keep upgrading to the gear each npc offers when you get the resources and if you feel you need it at the time. YOU CANNOT SWIM so don't go near water! Talk to all the owls to learn how to play and have the notes added to your compendium.

first few days playing on online open servers sucked people could come to your tree and break your shit but they fixed that real quick so very happy about that. there is not alot of content to boot seems like there is but only took us roughly 40hrs of game play to beat it where its at. usually i get bored of games within the first 10hrs of gameplay but we have 50+hrs already into it so it worked for the first week but now we are sad that we beat it and unlocked everything we could hopefully more content comes soon so my brain will say hey lets boot it back up n try it out. grounded did the same thing to me we beat it too fast and now i havent played it since the 1st month but smallands has alot more adult friendly vibes so hopfully it will be one of those games ill pick back hope... cheers and thanks for the awesome experience

Very frustrating to play, game needlessly punishes small mistakes - harshly. While great to look at, there are too many things to make your life unnecessarily painful, completely draining fun and making playing a chore. Multi-player (coop) is buggy (ha, ha, no pun), and the mechanics of tree-based movable sites is a crutch that doesn't help. Combat has artificially inflated difficulty by having enemies sensitivity to only one type (blade, blunt, piercing etc), forcing you carry a whole arsenal around. Progression is arduous, and when you tame pets, they die faster than you can say 'stay'. The quests are lackluster, and after 10 hours my friends and I, after needlessly dying too much in inaccessible locations, decided to call it quits. 
I'm sure there are people who enjoy this game, but I like to have a modicum of fun when playing. If I want chores and get frustrated, I go to work.",1680874509,1680874509,False,3,1,0.484760522842407227,0,True,False,True

This game is definitely worth the purchase if you like survival free roaming exploration style games but my honest opinion follows below. 


Positive -  

Graphics             9/10 
Sound design     9/10
Music                 9/10

The game plays very well and is very well optimised compared to some AAA titles

Negatives -  

The Story     5/10
Objectives    2/10 
Lore              2/10 

I'm not sure why but the map system is just awful hat's off to the developers I know how hard game development is and how much effort goes in to creating games talking from experience, but there's just something about the layout of objectives, the way you are running from one side of the map to the other there's literally just boss battles which as a solo player is just a grind and tedious, from what I saw in the trailers and to how it was put across I was expecting a competitor to Grounded but they are in completely different leagues if you are hoping for a Grounded experience or similar game-play it's nothing even close, it feels like an MMO that got lost and confused on the way, the creatures or some of them can be tamed, The gecko is useless and if any of your creatures just so happen to touch water they die I just think the developers really need to focus on the core game mechanics yes okay you are the size of an ant but... water wouldn't kill an ant they float... 

Well it's Early Access so I will hope the concerns moving forward are fixed it's a game of huge potential but so far in my opinion spoilt by poor execution back to the drawing board dev's the creatures need unique skills... objectives need reworking and some form of direction, there's a game there but at the moment I just can't see it.

I will continue playing and I will update this review as updates progress to be fair enough in my opinion I know how hard game development is but please don't mess this up it has huge potential.",1680871540,1680871540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I personally wish the difficulty on the survival and the jumps between gear tiers was greater. the biggest fault with Smalland's combat is the leash mechanic that doesn't hard reset, you can essentially kill any mob by long ranged agro (bow) run for 5-10 seconds to agro range limit to which creatures stop for a several second animation and then leisurely stroll back to their spawn location while taking any amount of damage and not reacting with attacks nor regenerating health more than their usual rate. this makes the Smalland world take a huge hit in immersion as someone who prefers to main an archer'. I'd greatly prefer to have a creature chase until sight line is broken, or attacking/getting attacked by another creature, more like ark survival evolved, or Valheim.  I dislike the lack of feel each different type of gear brings to the table outside of direct appearance.  there is a VERY small speed penalties for several gear sets but lack any real diversity of how it impacts your character or abilities. regardless of those cons I enjoyed the game and think most players will also enjoy this game.",1680460811,1680870541,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Needs to bake in the oven. Beautiful game. Very visually impressed me. Fun immediately killed, literally. As soon as leaving the opening area, I'm swarmed by ants. I die over and over again on seemingly the only path to take just to start the adventure. Very bad game design. Its like the devs want to punish you right away, and for what? Just so I know its a survival game? That's not fun. Killing the player just for the sake of killing. I'm sorry but imagine playing Ark, you play for 5 minutes and get swarmed by not dilos but raptors over and over again. Would you want to play? I was so excited for this game and in one hour the devs managed to piss me off enough to simply turn off the game. Its like worth a buy said, major kick in the balls just for the sake of kicking in the balls. Not fun

2) Review:

Update: Nice touch with the Steam Deck support. That's cool and all. This game is already really frustrating me with the combat system. I get it. Cutting damage versus blunt damage. That's cool and all but using the right weapon should be a buff, not an requirement. Like in Ark you can still kill a dilo if all you got is a stone hatchet but you would do better if you used a spear. Its a DPS system. With this game you have to use the right weapon right away or you're dead really really really quickly. Its incredibly frustrating. The audible cues aren't noticeable enough and you are felt feeling like you're being punished for even deciding to play this game. All joking aside, I died over and over and over again to these darn ants and still haven't been able to make a pick ax. Devs, have you played a game like Ark? That game is incredibly frustrating but fun. Your game is similar but is already proving to be even more frustrating and punishing to the noob. This needs to be fixed and really quickly if I do say so myself. IMAO, I'm just stating facts. Nobody wants to feel frustrated when trying to have fun.

3) Current review 4/6/2023

Update: Okay so my review got upgraded to a half a thumbs up. This last update addressed a lot of the feel of frustration. I now actually think I'll be able to enjoy this game. If they can continue to refine the combat I'm sure that will really help. One thing I can say is excellent is the building mechanics. Also harvesting resources so far doesn't seem to be too grindy which is awesome. Very rare for a survival game to not have major resource grinding but I still only have a few hours of game time. My wife keeps taking away my video game allowance time :(. Will continue to update this review but I'm liking what I'm seeing guys. Could this dethrone Ark? Oh and plays pretty good on Steam Deck too. Excellent controller support imao which is a really nice touch.",1680311386,1680867805,True,0,0,0.451388895511627197,0,True,False,True

I like a few of the things they've done with corpse running, there's lots of fall damage, (because you're small, and you climb up high) and drowning, and your grave spawns at the location you fell from, not the place you fell to.  This makes it actually possible to retrieve your stuff.   I've played a few games that got this frustratingly wrong.  I also really enjoy their relocatable base concept; you build at the top of a tree you claim, and if you claim a different tree, your entire base moves to that new location.  The summer / fall / winter and dawn / twilight changes are beautifully done.  Sunrises and sunsets are gorgeous.   
Totally worth it, definitely get it and try it out.  I had a lot of fun with it, it's really cool.

Now time for the constructive criticism: 
     There's not enough customization, all your character personalization is quickly covered by standard armor the build options are a little cookie cutter, but, that's a petty complaint about an early access game, give them time.
Admittedly, I'm bad at fighting timing, but more than most games, I never figured out what the technique for this game's fights were supposed to be. It always just ended up as a bash bash bash until someone's health bar was gone.  It seems like there was thought put into much more elegant combat, with all kinds of options, light or heavy hits, blocks, dodges, but each action takes up so much time and the lag from the previous action completing makes it really difficult to get any kind of rhythm or respond to your opponent's attacks.
      The first mount, the grasshopper, is AMAZING.  I love how it changes the difficulties of fall damage and travel in the game.  The next two mounts, the gecko and the wolf spider were disappointing.  They had no special abilities like the grasshopper's hop, and having them aggressively jump into battles and take friendly damage is kinda...  well, it doesn't feel good to accidentally stab your horse to death.  It would be nice to be able to attack from your mount, or use your mount's attack.  I expected the gecko to be able to climb walls!  What is a gecko but a wall climber?  
I also never got the hang of the grappling hook, I just kept running into the ground or smacking into things, falling and dying.  Even with the winged armor, as soon as I hit something, I'd start falling and die.  It was a briefly fun thing to play with, but it was never useful.  Because you didn't reel it in, your angle of swing was always sub-optimal and it was always easier just to find a higher place to glide directly or just walk.  I can understand running into things drops you out of glide, but can I at least autoglide at the end of the grapple swing?

Overall, this is a good game.  The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay elements work well.  If I had to compare it to another game, it's a lot like Valheim.  Both games feature character advancement via a tech tree.  As you gain strength you can take on more challenging enemies and areas which allow you to unlock additional gear, armor and other items.  Smalland does not have a skill system like Valheim so your gear is your primary method of becoming more powerful.  Like Valheim you will encounter a number of bosses to fight as you progress through the game.

Even though I'm making a lot of comparisons to Valheim, Smalland has a much smaller scope and that's my chief complaint about the game.  I will have completed the game in just under 40 hours.  Right now the map is somewhat small with invisible walls preventing you from travelling outside the play area.  I also feel that the difficulty ramp needs work.  There is not a significant enough distinction between the weakest and most powerful enemies in the game, nor is there enough difference between the weakest and most powerful gear.  I'll contrast that with Valheim where moving to the next biome represented a significant advance in your character's power and the difficulty of the game.  Difficulty across the current version of Smalland feels very similar from beginning to end.

I have high hopes for what Smalland may eventually become and would recommend it to others as long as they understand that in the current state it's quite short compared to other games in a genre where players often expect hundreds of hours of playtime.",1680277710,1680818570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Update...

After 60hrs I can say this game is fun, it gets much better once you get some decent armour and weapons and like any new game there is a learning curve but once you get the mechanics down its much easier. The fighting I find is to slow and a little clunky, I`d like to see it sped up and smoothed out.

They give you a quest line to complete unlocking new NPCs and items which is well done., its ea so I dont know what they have planned but it needs more things to do......side quests, mini bosses, items to find etc....Skill tree would be nice.

Base building is awesome, they let you flip pieces around any which you want leading to some very interesting creations already!!  lol

Armours look good and being able to glide around the map is much fun.


They have released 2 patches since release already, thats a good sign, so im not disappointed with my purchase and looking forward to more content as EA continues.",1680271157,1680814867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am ONLY putting NO because I bought this thinking it was near the end of it's early access and MAYBE it wouldn't be VERY buggy and MAYBE there would be more than 5 hours of things to do. I went back and forth searching for hidden cool stuff and found nothing special outside the 1st and only quest you have. People will give you side quests but it's just ""Kill a bad bug"" every time. 
Need to know:
There's no fast travel after you discover key locations. You are walking back and forth like mad. You can easily walk right past a key character who has a shack in the woods if you don't know that it's RIGHT BELOW YOU or ABOVE YOU. They will not appear on the map if you get close to them like most games. 
After using the bug sense a few times in the beginning, I never used it again. Everything that's a resource is easy to see. 
Your pets will either respawn right on top of your head every time you float down from a high place or if you simply turn a corner and they didn't follow you fast enough or they will just VANISH altogether. I used the pet whistle and it never came back.
Even on the highest settings, my game NEVER looked as colorful or pretty as the developer screenshots and I have a great ASUS TUF Gaming laptop. Once it snowed, most color was gone except my own character. Oh yeah..a little rain is bad for you but then they throw constant snow at you. 
Sometimes I'd try to equip the bow and it just kept re-equipping the sword I already had in my hand. Had to close and respawn at the bed to be able to change weapons again. Don't even get me started on why TF you have to re-equip arrow or grapple hooks EVERY DAM TIME you change from one to another.
Once you learn that the grapple isn't even a grapple, you'll stop dying from using it. It just gives you a TINY boost in one direction. So if you're not quite going to glide to a ledge, you can use the grapple to make that extra jump to the ledge. Or if you can't quite jump up onto a rock because it's a little too high, the grapple (if used exactly right) gets you up a little boost. That's all it's good for. 
Pick up every resource at least once. That's how you learn how to use them. Once you learn HOW to use them and they're in your codex/recipes/plans etc, you can drop the average resources to save space. 
It's cute...but that's it. Until it's finished, I can't give it a thumbs up. It has promise but it feels like they missed a LOT of opportunities. Like bug related jokes in dialogue or more options for coloring armor. Comedic writing would do this a huge help.",1680811277,1680811383,False,1,0,0.354453861713409424,0,True,False,True

Its probably worth buying this in early access unless you're the type to never come back after the full release. Early access means there's a few bugs, a few areas that look like they'll be something later, and a chunk of the endgame story is missing. About 90% of the map is available already and I suspect that last section is for the last string of missions. Bugs have been minimal for me and are simply related to items moving to my inventory funny and the game froze the first time I changed my graphics settings. Otherwise its been pretty clean gameplay.

Pros:
- Open world
- Clear progression
- Large amount of crafting options from the beginning
- Very detailed map with a good use of verticality
- Items are abundant, well balanced, and respawn
- The death penalty feels fair. A death hurts but doesn't make me want to quit
- Tree base mechanic is fresh and interesting

Cons:
- Combat is dry and not engaging. Its similar to Valheim but a bit worse in my opinion.
- There's no RPG aspect of character growth as all improvements are made through gear and consumables.
- Graphics are good, but they're in a weird spot between stylistic and realistic without really being either.
- It only took me 20 hours to hit the end of the story as of early access Patch #1. 
- Several sets of gear feel unnecessary (needs tuning)
- Pet taming becomes more prevalent later in the game when it no longer seems useful

I went into this game blind, I have not watched any start guides or how to videos.  I found myself making comparisons to Outward very early.  You have to eat, day/night cycle, seasons change.  I have really been having a good time.

Pros:
- coop ready and did not notice any lag from playing on another persons game
- in coop mode you can use your friends stuff (i.e. work bench, shelter etc...)
- visually stunning at times
- server controls just got an upgrade and are very nice
- intuitive controls, not to glitchy for an EA game
- open world, you can just go off and do whatever you want
- AI the bugs behave differently and I have not seen any hang ups the AI get stuck on

Cons:
- needs some optimization - I had it on ultra (by default) on an RX 6700 XT and 32 gbs of ram with a 5600X CPU.  also running on an M.2 SSD - I was getting massive amounts of studder as my frames hit single digits - I now run it on high with a frame lock at 60 and it seems fine - I could not lock it higher without huge dips
- 1st person toggle - IMO 3rd person view kills immersion immediately - I was thrilled to see they had a 1st person toggle - I hate the fact that it often defaults back to 3rd - would love to see a ""game option"" to make 1st the default view
- hit boxes for some of the gathering you do are very tiny, your axe may be hitting the target, but not the hit box

My recommendation for this game, go it solo for a while, learn the mechanics, get some better gear and have fun.  I wouldn't just jump into a coop game and have someone feed you the gear you should learn to make yourself.  Figuring it out is fun.

The environment is beautiful, the building system has some neat ideas, and many of the models are pretty nice! Unfortunately, this game also contains combat, and the combat system has a long way to go. As it stands, 90% of the enemies in the game are simply better than the player. It's not that they're too tough; they're definitely beatable, but it's hard to do so cleanly. They run faster than the player's sprint, and they don't run out of stamina. Their reach is longer than the player's (and often far longer than their attack animations). Some have insanely fast attack animations with hurtboxes that linger and can be spun on their base. And, worst of all, the player generally doesn't get to choose when and how to engage in combat. Enemies have massive aggro ranges, and cannot be outrun. It's either kill them or tank them until they leash.

Season changes are slight but sort of noticeable. The amount of encounters is reasonable even for multiplayer. Above all the Dev team is incredibly active.
The only few problems I have found within the game specifically, after taming a ladybug, they could not use any doors, if a door was in their path it would cause them to bug out and wedge themselves behind objects within the structure and eventually would just set themselves free, without the button prompt, along with all the items in its inventory. 
The second but I encountered, was almost game breaking. Seasonal changes are wonderful, but instant death from cold after a few moments outside is hilariously broken. After the most recent update this has been fixed, but at the time it was hilarious to lose to an invisible enemy.
Over all, I would highly recommend this game with the active dev team alone, but definitely tread lightly as early access may have more game breaking bugs to be fixed by the wonderful team.

* Gear breaks quickly and resources for endgame gear are pretty spread out, it would be nice to have iron available near the king stag
* More indicators about time of day would be nice, something that I could use to figure out how long I have before night time
* The tree base system is awesome, you need to highlight this more in the early game

Having now completed the early access content after almost 24 hours of play, I now feel comfortable leaving a review. This game is a lot of fun and very pretty to look at. Combat can be a little clunky at times, but gives a ""Souls Lite"" feel. Unfortunately the clunky comes from the fact that blocking is almost pointless and you can fight almost every enemy the same way if you bring the right kit. The building aspect reminds me of a limited version of Valheim, but with the added perk of being able to claim and build in giant ""Great Trees"". Once you build in one ""Great Tree"" you can move that base to any other one, making it easy to move as you need to harvest new materials. As for the progression, its completely gear based and everyone has the same opportunity to make each piece of gear, no skill point allocation needed. This was very refreshing to me as a survival game fan because I didn't feel like I was missing out on particular parts of the game because of my skill point choices. As you level up in gear and unlock new recipes, the game naturally nudges you to the next zone with the next items and enemies you will need. I've seen people complain about fall damage and enemy resistances, but I have no gripes with these aspects. Once you figure out that you can jump high but not fall far its easy to navigate, and then you get wings which negates the falling issues all together. 

My only complaints: 
- Taming is almost pointless. You're better off moving on foot or with your own wings to glide since only one tame can fight while you are mounted, and if your tame takes too much damage it will decide to attack you once the fight is over.
- No Shields. If you're going to have a block option and one handed weapons, at least give a shield.

Some Tips:
- Hold F to gather everything in an area after using tools to harvest.
- Rush your wings as soon as you can.",1680759382,1680759638,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game has two modes very hard or very easy depend if you have the mobs attack on sight or only attack if attacked. The game has season which is nice and mob have weakness to different types of weapons edge/blunt ect.. nice to see that in the game.  Things that need work a group system there is none. If owner shuts down there server before you get a chance to log out you can lose a lot of work. Had owner server go down because of storms in real life when we re logged lost all progress for the last 15 mins. Had to rebuild base and lost all matz.

Climb every tree! Tree houses are mobile camps that will save you a lot of building time!

- The start feels a little rough - but if you're used to games like ARK, you shouldn't have any problems here. You go explore, get overrun, you curse and go off again. Soon you get your hands on some stuff and understand how things work. The Compedium writes everything down you learn, so you can reread anytime

- The building system is my personal favorite: beautifully designed individual options allow you to swiftly build a base that transports you to the movie ""Leafman"" or to ""Arrietty"" and the borrowers. We sometimes just walk away from our base to watch it in the sunset, while the windmills turn in the breeze - it´s cheesy, but amazing. We also tend to put down little bases on several parts of the map with beds, to set our spawn-points there whenever we are in the area

- Just as appealing and comforting as the building system is, some enemies are just disgusting (in a positive sense) and horrifying. Especially the spiders have a great variance and my goodness… you think you´ve got used to being hit in the head by something and suddenly there is this big eight-legged thingy and you scream like a little baby!

- Very pleasant advantages for multiplayer: although opponents become stronger when several people play on one server, resources are easier to find and boss opponents can be worked on more effectively when there are several people. We often play with just two players and that alone brings huge advantages

So overall: this game has everything you could wish for and more, we are excited to see what will come next, as the game is still Early access, and I will now go fight a giant spider! Did I mention I´m afraid of ´em? This is how much I like this game! XD

The early game is difficult and its a challenge, but its a fresh experience from a lot of games which tend to be forgiving and quite easy. The combat takes a bit of learning but its very satisfying when you become successful at it. Throughout the map there's a lot of variety, in terms of scenery, resources, and enemies.
For me there's a lovely gameplay balance between promoting base building and exploring the world, as you need to build to access higher tiers of weapons and tools, but you need a lot of materials to build them in the first place
For the initial release into early access its really promising.
Of course there's a few issues, its not perfect. Every standard enemy only has one attack pattern, and some of these are repeated across multiple enemies.

All that being said, there is much work to be done, and I take it all with a grain of salt currently as it is still in early access. I'm only partly into my world and story line, so theres still yet more I need to unlock - but at this point in time I find that I wish there was a clock to tell the time, and a weather overlay. I feel there needs to be a more efficient way of crafting items as you have your basic crafting inv and then a workbench, I feel some items at the workbench could be added to your standard inv. I also feel that there could be perhaps grappling hooks or rope as fall damage is a lot. I understand you can tame flying insects, but perhaps the hook could have low durability so it pushes players into taming long term.

The Grasshopper can’t stick to any surfaces nor climb slowly or even glide a little as they would do in the real world, If they hit something they will fall straight down however it is the best traveling mount they have in the game. The Gecko can’t even walk over simple rocks nor can it climb at all. The Spider is completely useless because it can’t jump or climb. It can attack while riding it but its HP is so low. What's the point? They built horses that can’t jump in a very extremely focused jumping/climbing game. The Dragonfly can’t even fly without losing stamina and it dies so fast to some lowly creature. The 2nd thing is they made a grappling hook that is basically a silly string gun.

----------------------------------------
A really fun openworld survival title.
Set in a fairy kingdom with a fun world to explore.
Actual missions with NPCs, armor sets, weapons, mounts and more.

The game does not do anything new or will blow you away with story.

Exploring, finding new areas, fighting bosses etc.

Graphics are nice. 
Game play can be hard at first, due to the tombstone runs, but at least when you die, you come back with your sword and armor and torch, if equipped.
The trick with early game play is to gather as much wood and fiber as you can and get your armor made before you venture out into the world.

If I had to change anything I would say that it needs an option to turn off the corpse runs to the tombstone.  I've never liked that in games, but it is tolerable here because if you die someplace inaccessible, your tombstone is place on the last piece of solid ground you were on before you died.

-Graphics are great, has performed amazingly so far on Ultra/High everything.
-Music is relaxing, might need more though.
-Building is fun and alot of options for early access.
-Great Tree/Base system is awesome. Being able to bring your base to a new location on a whim is great.
-Progression is solid for EA, quite a few tools, armors, and weapons to seek out.
-Difficulty is in a good place. Alot of people have complained about Aggro and Not being able to swim, but without these things the game would be a joke difficulty wise, it becomes very easy once you gear up, so the struggle early on is welcomed and needed imo.

CONS
-Not able to label chest's. Inventory management is a bit brutal.
-Punishing solo/early game experience. It's not as bad as people make it out to be, but enough complaints about it warrant a mention. I myself find the game a little too easy at times.
-Missing some building pieces we really need like rounded fences, half walls/floors/stairs.

Overall, it's up there with Valheim as far as enjoyment and wonder goes for my first play through.

The mid game was amazing getting the grappling hook and flying around like spider man while gliding through the air was amazing and i can not think of another game that had this fun of a mid game.

The ""end"" game is great killing all the bosses and building a base up on top of the tree and switching the base to other trees was really fun, It was cool being able to move my whole base when ever i wanted.

My only complaints would be the ammo could be equipped along with the hooks for the grappling hook, the game NEEDS a amour stand cause the armours are so nice and stylised not to mention i worked hard for them and i want to show them off in my base not just throw them out for chest space also their was no iron axe for harvesting or a iron spear.

Somehow that has shifted to every game being ""Early Release"" so we can pay to test them ourselves. What an absolute croc of S***.

The scaling is good, getting better tier weapons and armor makes a noticable impact on your ability to survive and murder the local wildlife (insectlife).

My largest gripe with the game play itself and playing it is not making my own armor.  You trade with NPCs for it.  So you have to go to the NPCs, figure out what they want (at least the codex updates and you can look at what they want without running to them every time) for the armor pieces.

My biggest issue is that the game has terrible steam adaption.  It works better with Epic Games and their friends list for group play, but as of yet without luck on your side trying to play with friends on Steam isnt viable.  You cannot invite to game from friends list, you cannot search for a server in the list, so your only bet is to find it sitting there and you can only view so many servers each loading.  So if you want this to play with friends, currently, epic store is your best bet and even that is questionable as I havnt tried it myself.",1680625178,1680625178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The technical bugs have on occasion been rather annoying. I had an issue where my things I'd drop when I die spawn in the WORST possible spot for me to retrieve them. That was about as bad as it has gotten for me though. 

Alot of the major gripes I have seen about combat being clunky are fair. Combat feels kinda weird, but it's not that bad in my opinion. My biggest complaint is the spawn rate of the ants. I get that its ants, and they are everywhere in real life. But I have to agree with what some folks are saying, they pose a challenge at first but after about....thirty minutes they're just kind of a chore to deal with. I always scoff and roll my eyes when I hear them chirping in the grass. Because I know my time, and weapon durability are about to be wasted.

Jumps are a little floaty, I personally think it's not necessarily a bad thing in this game?  Like you can, and will die often because of it. BUT you're also VERY small, if you hadn't already figured that out, and the world is big (shocking I know) so the height you get from jumping is actually very helpful at times. 

Building a base can be a little bit clunky sometimes, but I'm sure they'll figure that one out. Just needs some touch ups, but otherwise it's fine. 

Over all I think it's a very good game, it has alot of potential. It's just in early access so things are still getting worked out, and I don't exactly think its fair to give a solid judgment on quality yet. I do think this is a very good start though, and I can't wait to see how things progress from here.",1680617317,1680617317,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Maybe a crossbow? More character customization. I.e., Clothes and such. It's kinda hard to tell other people apart when you're all wearing the same armor. Maybe add dyes to the game?

If you liked ""A Bug's Life"" as a child and you Enjoy Survival Games, Give it a try. 

Crafting is enjoyable, not too demanding. Building is fun, but not unique. 
Choice of light and heavy attacks, Iron Scythe animation is on point. 
Can Mount different insects throughout the game. Not all can jump, not all can attack.
Set armor is unlocked in an enjoyable way. Hope they add more.
Bosses look cool, Moves are the same, no unique specials.
Can claim and build bases in the top of trees. Can Teleport said base to a different tree. Quality of life. 
Movement Really Picks up Late Game, Didn't even use mounts late game. Can Just Glide Tree Branch to Tree Branch. 
Mounts die really easy.

Cons: Spent at least 5 hours (Being Generous) running to my body for my gear. Bug's charge attack glitches and they teleport and smack you. Can't Swim, so if you land, slip, or a bug smacks you into water, that's it. Gliding doesn't always ""Glide forwards"" You just Fall slowly at a small angle. Harvesting Items aren't in every next set upgrade. Building Assets are lacking. Bugs spawn inside the map, lots of annoying buzzing you can't find and slay. Spots that look like you can explore, then you get stuck inside or behind a invisible wall. 

Things I hope They add:
More Armor and Weapon Sets
Higher tier Harvesting items.
More unique building assets to craft. 
Tier 1 & 2 Mobs has Unique or More Skill Attacks.
Bosses with better loot tables (Not just the Unique Quest Item)
Bosses with Unique Attack Tables
Ability to Fly, not just hover downwards. 
Ability to craft low tier bandages from Bag.
A shield or Dual Wielding.
Ability to combo into attacks
Mounts can be Upgraded or Level.
Mounts can be dismissed.

Smalland is not a Grounded but rather an Ark: Survival Evolved only in the cute elf setting.
At the beginning you get the basics of the game explained and then you can start exploring and building.

Of course we have the most fun in the coop, but you can also do things in the single player, but the individual elite opponents are a tough nut to crack.

There are a few bugs here and there, for example:
Sometimes not all the contents of the chests are displayed and from time to time you have problems joining a multiplayer party.

It always helped us to restart the game completely and if that didn't help, an error check!

I'm excited to see how the game develops, the developer's plans for the beginning of the year look promising.
Purchase recommendation 😊

Tips and Info:

Character created at the beginning can be taken from server to server and used in single player.

I found the controls and progression frustrating in a bad way. I'll let others compare this to Subnautica, Valheim, etc and try to speak to it straight.

The combat isn't bad, though the music can get a bit in your face (like the rest of the game). You'll be doing combo swings, a secondary larger swing, blocking, and dodging. Blocking is... terrible. The time between deciding to block and actually blocking is a lifetime. There didn't seem to be skill progression. The bow is important, but you have no idea how its working... I must have spent 20 arrows trying to hit a bee; even though I was killing beetles with arrows no problem.

The armor is... so you find NPCs and they make the armor; so you have to get to them. I found navigating the world to be more frustrating than rewarding. Any leaf can be blocking a fall and it feels impossible to judge how far you can fall before you die. I died, a lot.

I drown, I fell, I drown, I fell, I drown, I fell.

Building is difficult because you can't see and you don't know where to look to snap things. Why are there so many roof pieces and nothing else?

It didn't feel like I could progress and exploring just meant dying more. I got into the combat a bit and started grinding/etc; but then you drown again because you didn't know how far you could fall/jump - you never get to explore because you are punished but not rewarded.

At this point, it's too grindy and a bit buggy. Then there are the storms - basically go take a break unless you are out exploring and then again... punished. There is no fleeing for the most part, and no back tracking - lots of one-way terrain.

When you die you keep what you are holding, but it bugs the inventory slot. Can't remember the other bugs, should have made some notes in case the devs read this.

Anyways, it's just too slow and punishing without any kind of cool factor or ""oh I just need to do X"" to keep me going. I won't refund it and will come back in six months to try again.

+  No crashes or bugs thus far
+  Large open varied world to explore
+  Base building/decorating
+  Music is unobtrusive
+  You can move your entire base to a new great tree on a different part of the map
 
[h1]---CONS---[/h1]
-  Combat isn't all that great - blocking & camera is horrible during fights
-  Sometimes you get stuck in a crouch during combat
-  Sometimes you can't unequip things
-  Progression goes pretty quick until you need flint
-  Placing a roof on a structure can be frustrating
-  The map is borderline useless - you can place waypoints, but not precisely
 
[h1]-+-+Meh+-+-[/h1]
-  Needs more building/decorating options
-  Needs more server options, like Conan or Ark
-  A real save system is needed for singleplayer

[h1]###Comments###[/h1]
Someone mentioned that durability is laughable, but you don't need to repair after every fight - I've gone days in-game without repairing.  Also, [i]if[/i] you repair early enough it is free - meaning no resources are consumed, so there is no penalty for repairing early and frequently.  Also, if you have enough resources on you, you can place a workbench down on a sufficiently flat spot or foundation, and then repair everything rather easily.

Combat needs some work.  First you can't lock onto enemies, which makes the camera a pain as it seems to always point in the wrong direction.  Then there's the wonky blocking - you hold to block or you hit the block button and you block for about two seconds, then there's a cooldown before you can block again.  Your best bet is to listen to the audio cue that all mobs have, and then dodge when they attack.  Either way, your stamina drops, so keep an eye on that too.  Also, it is way too easy accidentally switch from 3rd to 1st person perspective during fights or to accidentally crouch, then you're stuck crouching for a bit before you can stand again.

Flint - ah, flint.  Yes, it is a bit of a pain to get to, but you don't have to fight every enemy you encounter - in fact, I'd say you should avoid combat completely when going to get flint the first time.  Get in and get out.  So much is gated behind flint, which I can somewhat understand, but I feel that the choice of flint was just an odd one.  Flint, the stuff that's laying around like rock in real life - it is in only a few difficult to reach locations on the map, really?  Same for bark - trees all around you, but bark and flint are only available from higher level locations...

Currently, I'd say content is a bit sparse in terms of building options and story elements, but hopefully they'll add new content with each update while in Early Access.  What they do have is pretty enjoyable despite some issues, most notably the combat and the gating of flint/bark.  If you can overcome that, get it and support the dev, otherwise hold off until they have a few more updates posted.",1680281679,1680566083,True,2,0,0.547697365283966064,0,True,False,True

Points of Note to be fixed, changed, added, or looked at:

#1 You can only tame one creature at a time.  This is for both a pet Ladybug AND a mount.  It's one OR the other, not both. 
#2 Far more support structures need to be added for building. Basic wood and Reinforced pillars are just not enough if you want to build a large multi-level structure. You''l end up having the lower floors FILLED with pillars and no room, in order to support the upper floors and the roof. There need to be angled supports and/or supports that are concave/convex like some of the walls and roofs.
#3 Need to be able to rename pets.
#4 Need to be able to prevent a pet from following you inside a structure. Having a gecko mount in the house is taking up a huge amount of space.  The will only path out if you remove walls.
#5 The incessant bug sounds from spawn locations or nearby spawn locations is far to confusing. We already have to keep our heads on a swivel to look for incoming hostiles. Wandering around some random rock that has beetle sounds coming from it is weird and just doesn't feel right.
#6 When you get the message ""Not Enough Structural Support"", there needs to be an indication as to what is needed to shore up that support.  Similar to #2, I don't want to be placing hundreds of pillars to support upper level structures only to find out I never needed them. 
#7 Doors need an indicator on which way they open up before placing.",1680557659,1680557659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's no more reason for that than when you're using the grapple gun to get around which I thought by way of it being a swing grapple and not a climbing grapple that it was supposed to be used to get around quicker but it just gets you killed over and over again with the fall damage. 

The combat is not good at all. It seems almost impossible to prevent yourself taking damage from enemies as you don't have any proper blocks. You DO have a block but it only blocks some of the damage and there is this two second delay after attacking when you can't block at all so timing it properly is very annoying. There is also a massive problem with enemy hit boxes. Not being able to hit them but for them to be able to hit you. Or not hit you, rather. I've seen enemies faced in the opposite direction of me, I dodged out of the way of their attack because I saw it coming, and their attack still hit me.

I fell, died, ran back to my gravestone which was on the ledge still.. infinite loop of death. 

I don't think I should have to go out of my way to get a hammer and gather EVERYTHING to build my way up to the gravestone just to retrieve my stuff, which in the middle of a swamp with spiders/toads was not ideal.

- Crouch speed needs to be increased to work as a true stealth mechanic.
- More enemy attack patterns need to be added. As it stands, most enemies only have a single attack.
- Dodging badly needs iframes, attacking should cancel blocking, blocking needs to have no cooldown period.
- No combat lock for the camera.
- Water shouldn't be an instant death. Taming a grasshopper just to jump into water and immediately die and lose the pet doesn't make for a pleasant experience or a functional game.
- Remove fall damage. Insane that it exists in the first place.
- Leaves have no collision. For whatever reason, you can't stand on giant, sturdy-looking leaves.
- Sort function desperately needed for inventory/chest management.
- Items in hotbar should not be duplicated in inventory bag space.
- Bag space is very cramped, especially given the small smack limits and wide variety of resource types.
- Need to be able to truly build anywhere, no area should be absurdly ""restricted for building.""
- Armor should be able to be crafted from your base. NPCs should sell recipes, not do all armor crafting.
- The map visuals need to be completely redone. Currently, the map is functionally useless, only displaying a top-down view of what appears to be the tree canopy. I can't imagine pixies mapping out their forest in this style, instead of lines on parchment.
- Seasons and their passing is poorly communicated, and confer no changes on the game world. Winter just adds white on top of many environmental textures, but doesn't change any insect behavior, freeze water, or add snow cover.
- Too many hostile insects with very wide aggro ranges. Between this and the lackluster combat, the gameplay experience is mostly sprinting around the map with a half dozen hostile insects in hot pursuit.
- Farming is conspicuously absent.

The biomes are pretty cool so far, and the ""Dungeons"" have been fun, from ant holes, to a pile of garbage in a trash can. Combat takes some getting use to if you aren't use to action based games. Each enemy type has a weakness and attack pattern, and you the player have light and heavy attacks. Something helpful i found out for combat is you can combo light attacks into heavy attacks.
One of the coolest features the game includes is the Great Treetop feature. The game offers many tools for each building tier to make a unique looking build which you can transfer between treetops in your own world and even to your friends worlds.

It feels a lot like valheim which can be good and bad.  Hardcore valheim players may see it as a copy and say why not just play valheim. But I see it as a easy transition due to experience of valheim in a whole new world with new experiences like flying, bug mounts like grasshoppers that can jump or some that climb or fly.  You can even get bee armor with wings to glide around or use a grappling hook like in the borrowers movie.  Remember that old movie?

The combat is hard and can be frustrating when you start out but once you learn how to handle each creature it's not bad.

The base building is very easy to get into and the fact I can make a hobbit style house is a plus.  You can share your base with public or just with friends and you can take your bases to their server which is a huge exciting feature.  Keep in mind you can build anywhere it's just tree bases that can be shared.

im going to start with the con's 
1 you haft to always have a work bench with you  to repair your gear  since stuff breaks  to much.
2. Combat  in janky   at best . dodge/block  a a attack doesn't  mean when i roll away to dodge attack the  enemy bug  move while it it attacking  meaning while it attacks it slides right to me  an hits me. Combat need to be worked on big time
3. You  have no way of knowing what storage chest has what in it since you are unable to mark the chest with was mats are in it .
4. aggro range on every monster in the game is to big  an need to be tuned down . like ant's  . they aggro from a long  away
5. enemy  pathing  is not great . some are stuck inside objects  some  slide around . some  move to much in combat .
6. your only able to tame  one insect  at a time / tame are useless  since they have very to no hp. ladybug get attacked by any and everything . an die's insta with all your stuff . an you haft to go out retame another one  which sucks .
7.Clay is going to be hard to grind for  due to the placement in which it was placed .
8.the crafting of armor can only be done at the person you unlocked it at . an not at your own crafting station's

This just hit's  only a few cons there is prob alot more 
the pro's  of the game
1 it looks great great 
2  nice little story 
3 design of it is nice  but not the greatest 
4 the building is fun . alot of builds . but you truly only need one build . since you can base hop  your whole base to any  great tree.

 As of right now ima say No i don't Recommend it .  due to the problem the game has .  but  doesn't mean the game cannot still be fun .
Games o would recommend  
1 Velheim . this game just takes it to a whole new level .
2 Grounded .  fun  even the game play is fun an story

Haven't played multiplayer yet but would love to as I find co-op survival to be one my favorite experiences in gaming unfortunately I have no friends that have bought this yet :-/. The grind isn't to bad once you figure out how you can gather resources more efficiently, early game it seems like the grind might be a lot more than it really is as you progress a bit and find a good place to start a base. The Great tree mechanic is interesting and useful to ""move"" your base around the map so you can explore and gather resources etc. 

Combat is OK, its a little tough at times due to stamina and dodging sometimes helps but then trying to get a hit in after dodging is about as bad as just not dodging and hit it when you had the chance and just tank it. probably more my inability than the games issue. 

Building is nice as you can overlap some pieces to make interesting shapes however sloped roof pieces don't work well when doing some of the odd shaped floor plans. Seems to have plenty of options for building. 

Crafting is OK, it works and is a little grindy for certain items. perhaps I'm just wanting a certain tier earlier than i should and it will become much easier to get the mats required etc.

Overall game play and exploration is Fun and challenging.  If you like survival games and early access I don't think you can go wrong with this one. Hopefully the Dev's will balance stuff out better.

Building is pretty intuitive. Similar to valheim but it allows you to replace lower tier structures with the higher tiers without destroying them. Nice.

 Combat feels dark soulsish- time your iframe dodges or if youre lazy you can just guard and pound some healing items. They work in combat. Bringing potions makes the tougher fights significantly easier. Armor also allows you to stay out in cold/winter if you use the right types.

Seems like progression is decent. Forces you to explore a bit- and probably die. It's usually a good idea to toss up a tiny shelter with a bed near where you're exploring in case you aggro a horde of bees or ants early on and can't quite deal with them. It would be nice to have the npcs give you a hint to where certain resources might be found. 

You can tame some bugs to help you gather or travel faster. Just got a Gecko and they are mounts and decent combat pets. Feels like ladybugs and grasshoppers a bit too squishy and they die too easily to random aggro.

The tried and true strategy of baiting an attack then swinging works on basically everything that doesn't chain attacks together. Either I didn't find the tutorial owl that tells you how to roll or there straight up isn't one but that move is essential to fight anything more complex than an ant. Most enemies have one attack that either keeps them in place or lunges forward with the latter having significant tracking. Talking ""spin around in place to snap you after a roll"" signifigant.
   
Survival: Actually surviving in the game is quite simple since hunger/thirst is one bar and gets filled by any food source. My personal experience was to take the heads of the ants that aggro from super far away and cook them over a campfire for a nearly endless food supply since the ants that give them are found basically anywhere you look. The only time I changed my food source from the most basic thing was when the season changed to winter and the extra cold resistance of other foods was necessary to be able to explore. 
  
 Building: Tangentially related to survival is building because without a shelter of your own the storms will freeze you to death. If you're familiar with ARK's or Grounded's building system of magnetizing pieces together then you will be familiar with this system too. Foundation, walls, roof then boom a shelter that will protect you from the elements. Make sure to build it big enough to house your crafting stations and storage boxes because any of those without a roof over them will slowly take damage over time due to not being sheltered.
   
   Misc points: Toggle sprint is good, thank you for saving my pinkie. Taming is kind of wack, one tame and outside of flying ones or the one storage one there doesn't seem to be much point. Tamed a gecko and tried to bring it home over some lily-pads. Good news, they can swim! Bad news, there is a frighteningly short distance you can put between yourself and a tame before it auto releases itself. Getting a forge and furnace for metal tools requires the building of a windmill for some reason. Had no reason to so I finished the game's story without the most powerful tools and armor. Armor is made by npcs which is rather annoying.

   Conclusion: The game just isn't worth it for the gameplay alone. I would personally wait for major overhauls to combat, balance of certain survival mechanics and more nuances to actually interacting with the creatures of the overworld. If you're sold on the fantasy then by all means, go ahead but temper expectations for a good looking but rather shallow experience.",1680493934,1680493934,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

The world is genuinely beautiful and feels very exciting to explore. The biomes are very different to eachother but blend together nicely so there aren't really any weird borders where it just goes from grass to desert or tundra like a lot of other games(especially MMORPGs).
The soundtrack itself mixes between relaxing as you just explore to that really majestic sound when you get into combat.
The in-game sounds all felt solid on top.
There is a small story that prompts you where to go but it doesn't enforce it by any means or force you to take on tasks in any order.
The enemies are introduced in a fair order so you are seldom put in a position where you had no chance to prepare to take on the next tier. The combat felt responsive and it never felt like it was bullsh*t that got me killed rather than my own lack of skill or not being prepared enough. But the lack of a shield made the block option much less viable than just evading or just straight up jumping for the entire game. The only death I had that felt like BS was gliding colisions with an invisible wall which made me unable to glide so I fell to my death but the gravestone was an easy recover.
I do feel like it was a mistake to not lock certain tech tiers behind some bosses however. As this just made me go from having the starter armor straight to the royal armor, which in my opinion is the second strongest armor in the game. As well as having access to the best weapon tier before even taking down my first story boss.
I get that it's still in early access but I would love to see some more value in the different armor sets. Especially given how rough some of them are to get compared to the Royal Armor.
The mounts are made available at a decent pacing but except for being a cute addition to the base they aren't really strong or fast enough to be worthwhile outside of that.
It would be nice with a 'hide helmet' feature. The game comes with some pretty nice character customization but as soon you get access to the first helmet none of that matter since they cover it all.
The base building system feels very solid with a lot of options for the creative base builders and as more decorative items are added it can only get better. Having the base be transferable across the map is also a welcome change. Not having to travel across the map to get one resource and then all the way when I can just bring my base to a location somewhat near me felt like a good quality of life. One change that I really hope to see change is that exiting to the main menu and then loading back in instantly(if you don't count loading screens) teleports me back home and this makes the 'Unstuck' command in the menu moot.

Overall I would recommend this to people that like the sandbox/survival/exploration type of games. It is still rough around the edges but it is worth the price and worth the time.",1680479742,1680479742,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Biggest issue is the main draw of this over grounded, IMO, is the taming system. Your monsters randomly die from nothing or poor mechanics. 

In the first night I played. 1 Grasshopper jumped straight into a river, insta died. (My first jump, didn't know how far it went.)
Second grasshopper was parked well outside the angry horn beetle fight. The boss left me mid fight, turned on the mount behind a giant rock, charged it with no provocation, insta killed it.
Ladybug dies, I don't know how. I got caught in a storm far away from the tree, almost made it home. Ladybug is at full health through the whole storm. Is full health as I die. No message that it died. When I respawn, it's just gone.
Gecko was fighting with me, in a cave, water around, Kill another bug. Hold F and run around to pick up loot. Accidentally mount Gecko cause mount and loot are same button. In the process of running so the gecko starts running as soon as mounted. Runs 2 feet into water, nearly killing me and insta killing the gecko.

Water kills animals in 2-3 seconds. There is no time to react. That's insane for how much water there is on the map.

Very upsetting to see your animals die. Especially from mechanics, poor design choices, bugs or eve your own stupidity.

The building is decent. Snapping is a little finicky but overall decent. Was able to make a nice little house with the available pieces. Various roof options are nice to see. Does need walls to match those roof options.

Durability is consumed pretty quickly even for flint tier tools. Materials are NOT pulled from storage when crafting or repairing. The frequency of repairs that require materials is pretty high. 2-3 repairs per hour with active play. Having to rummage through storage to find the 4 different components needed to repair a single item and then put them back is very tedious. Building and repairing should pull from nearby chests. At this point in OWSC genre this should be a standard feature.

Food is a lot of the same. There is no benefit to Spider Chow over Few Chowder. The food values and buffs are all the exact same. There's no reason to eat an Ant Skewer over a Mushroom Steak. Food needs to be different to be valuable.

Combat is very arcadey. Enemies teleport to you while winding up for an attack. You see the telegraph and roll out of the way. It will often still reach you. Rolls need to be timed perfectly. Often times you will be out of stamina from doing one combo though so a lot of fights are just face tanking and spaming bandages and potions. Very little strategy, tactics or elegance with this combat. That's not to say it's not also fun. Just some things feel cheap atm.


All of this is stuff that can be excused as the game being EA. And that's fine as long as it's addressed. I'm putting the game down for now until it's out of EA and I will revisit. For now, I'd say wait and see how the devs react to feedback. Give it some time to simmer.

Currently too hard by yourself, and likely would be a challenge in co-op as while. I chalk this down to overzealous enemy movement/hitboxes and clunky combat mechanics. The block, roll, and jump actions feel clunky and oftentimes useless. If an ant attacks you, it seems to be hitting not you but the space you occupy, and at all heights. If you jump straight upward before a hit lands (bear in mind, your standard jump is quite high) you still get hit. In general, jumping feels like an unkindness to the player. As a mechanic, jumping should improve how you explore a world, but here it just makes things worse. Your ability to auto-grab or climb slopes is so erratic that most of the time, you'll try to jump up a log or something and slide right past the ledge you were aiming for, falling quickly to your death, a death which may happen after only a few feet (or inches, I guess, given your size. Millimeters? You tell me the unit of measurement, Smalland. After you make your jumping/climbing/falling mechanics more forgiving, anyway.) 

I've played souls-likes and survival crafters for years, so I am not at all opposed to being seriously challenged, but the challenge needs to feel natural, and it just doesn't, here. It feels as though the challenge is coming not from the world but from poorly tested character movement and combat. Perhaps there are crafting tree items that bandage the clunky movement and falling damage, maybe a parachute or climbing gloves or something--I don't know, because the current mechanics don't inspire me to grind my way higher to find out. 

That all said, I absolutely adore the visual style of this world, so so much. It's truly beautiful and epic. This is also an EA game only just released, with a clear roadmap. For these reasons alone, I give a very tentative thumbs up, not because I think the game is fun now (I don't) but because I think it could be fun after some changes, particularly if the devs show receptivity to criticism and modify their roadmap accordingly.

The good stuff
---------------------------------------
Colorful cute and lovely handmade World 
Nice music and SFX
Building is great lots of options
Nice looking armors and weapons
and you can move your base from treetop to treetop for free
Astonishing !!!!

The bad stuff
----------------------
There is still a lot of work to be done in the animation department
Because combat is kind of shaky
Sometimes it's hard to get to your grave
Sources are very far apart <--- This makes it difficult and a grind
Game Difficulty Scales poorly
Camera Clipping is a bit weird at times

Will play more when the updates come out
Good luck to you Dev's
hope you make this game a great

My current issue is that the game is barely playable from lag. I have the recommended hardware specs, but still had to drop to low quality just to have a game that didn't just jump from one frame to the next. Yes, all drivers are up to date. No, I don't have this problem with other games. So not sure why this is happening, but there's something not right.

From there we get to the issue of non-intuitive game play. The owl advice statues are a fine way of providing communication and character wisdom,  but there's no reason that the character not being able to swim shouldn't have been established well before ever encountering water. Beyond that, the combat system is kinda awful. I got completely swarmed by ants, killed, and sent back to spawn, because I'm supposed to magically know that I have to do some interaction with the bed to make it a spawn. Resource gathering is also annoying. As others have said, you have to perfectly line up your cursor on the resource to pick it up. I don't see any reason that the resource wouldn't automatically go into your inventory once you interact with it's parent source, i.e. once I hit ""f"" at a sap clump, I should have to chase sap balls everywhere.

I'm really rooting for this game and hope it gets both better and playable. If you're looking for a polished game in this genre though, go to Grounded.",1680469404,1680469404,False,0,0,0.490936577320098877,0,True,False,True

For an early access game it's relatively devoid of any kind of game breaking issues and has quite a bit of content. Round about 15 hours or so if you blitz from start to finish in the story, do minimal building, and are solo. In a group you could probably beat this in 10.

Biggest issues right now are the Tree Encampment exploit. I don't know if this was intentional or not but once you get a tree encampment a lot of content gets trivialized almost instantly. When you go out on a gathering run, rather than run all the way back, just quit to the menu and start the game back up and you'll spawn at your bed in your base. That being said, there instances where this has to be used due to terrain and death. I have died in spots where my gravestone was in a place where it would have stayed for eternity had this feature/exploit not existed.

The combat is fun enough but some mobs are really a pain in the neck to fight in melee.

Hit boxes are also a little off as I've clearly swung at a gecko, but they turn just slightly causing a whiff on my attack. Alternatively I've timed my dodge against a hornet or bee only to still be stung and poisoned.

Material's and gathering. Like most games, when you unlock access to the highest tier gear, the game is basically over. 

Clay is only really useful for the better bandages, but the healing patch bandage works just fine.

Building a castle on top of a tree is neat, I just wish that the trees had different design options instead of just being obvious copy/paste's of the same exact layout. I know this would do away with the teleportation of your base each time you claim a tree as an encampment, but I think this needs to happen as often times it was easier to just travel around the map from one tree encampment position to the next and just claim the tree for my base and keep right on grinding. Especially early on. 

Additionally, I think that having it where you can't simply teleport your base around and making them fixed to the tree you built them in would go a long way to have some investment into the game map rather than just being able to create a new game with the same character and still having everything on you. A few map options to toggle these kinds of things on and off would go a long way.

Having some variations in encampment location options would be nice as well. Just having them on top of the trees is neat, but what about in the hollow of an broken tree? Maybe under a stump? On top of a power pole? 

I know we can build wherever we want, but if you're going to introduce safe building area's at least jazz them up a bit and give us some variety in locations and themes rather than just having them always been in the same exact type of tree.

Armor and weapons are very well designed and the damage specificity towards certain bugs is fun, but it forces a lot of inventory clutter as you need, at minimum, 2 weapons to fight every creature. Armor damage resistance buffing is neat as it means that even if you have the highest tier armor, even lower tiers (to a certain point) can actually be better against certain mobs. Which means you don't have to upgrade to the highest tier armor (I ran with the Silk armor most of the game). Weapons are kind of the same way as well. Once you get to the mid tier the only purpose in having the best weapons and armor is to just make it a little easier on yourself as the mid tier stuff works quite well for most things.

Definitely needs more customization for the character creation as well as for building. The amount of decorations is pitiful right now. Armor coloring needs to be a thing as well. 

Difficulty wise, the game is fair. It's not too hard, but it's not super easy either. Some bosses have entirely unavoidable attacks and dodging, while useful, is kind of unnecessary when you really just end up face taking everything while maintaining the constant heal DOT from your bandages. This is more true with multiple people.

Durability is a joke. This needs to be fixed either by allowing us to upgrade parameters on weapons and armor to increase things like damage, durability, attack speed, stamina usage, etc., or they just need to be increased on the back-end because right now it's really bad. 

Being able to upgrade the parameters on weapons and armor would also allow players freedom to choose which style they want to use for the long term rather than pigeon holing them into a choice which would go a long way to increasing the longevity of the game. Investing time into certain gear to make even a wood sword as good as an iron sword or at least make them somewhat competitive (with visible changes in the upgrade) would just be a neat feature. Because personally, there some weapon and armor designs which I prefer from the lower tiers that look better than the higher tiers and having to travel around and find these armor makers and gathering all of the materials for these armor pieces would make that investment that much more worth it IMO.

Being able to upgrade your health and stamina pools would be great as well.

More mob variety would be good to see. Bigger badder boss fights. Getting all my friends together to fight a chicken would be a hell of an experience. Or a snake.

The creature aggro range and range they chase you is not balanced. Night time creatures gain increased aggro and damage making night time a stand still time for new players/games but will eventually probably fade off as you get much better gear and a base set up. Fall damage is a serious thing and none of the world if flat, once again making night time movement even more perilous. There is no way to retrieve your corpse if you cannot get to it for any reason including the grave marker landing in deep water or floating in air off of a cliff, which from what I can tell is actually a glitch. Dying also moves the clock forward 12 hours which can essentially set you in a perpetual night time environment if you're unlucky enough to die in the window. Building does seem easy enough though, it doesn't take much to have something that the game considers shelter (basically a lean-to) which is super nice.

Overall this game has a lot of potential and it's pretty fun to play. There are however some big QOL changes that need to happen. 

- Map needs color coded markers or just different icons. 
Every marker is a blue exclamation mark and you can not differentiate them. This also goes for tracking Big Trees, they are color coded on the map, but when tracked they are all blue.

- Storage chests have a very frustrating bug.
I saw in real time my items disappearing from my inventory, moving between different chests, and just disappearing and reappearing from inventory and chests. This is probably my biggest frustration.

- bugs are AGGRESSIVE. on lowest difficulty they are still hard to kill. You can't run away as they will chase you until you die. Only until we switched to peaceful was I allowed to actually explore and like the game without worrying about a gang of ants or bees coming to murder me. Peaceful is a must as of now.

- mounting bugs are kind of awkward to control. my grasshopper twice has glitched inside of a rock.

- Fall damage is way too high. You think you could make that jump? probably not. 

- we need an option to enable keeping inventory upon death. not everyone wants to HAVE to travel across the whole map just to collect their shit.

This game lacks almost every single quality of life feature you can think of when it comes to survival builders on top of having annoying mechanics to deal with, there are ""storms"" which force you to remain sheltered until they are over, they are seemingly random but always happen when you are far away from your base, almost as if it's programmed to annoy the fuck out of you.

Stamina is way too limited, you're forced to either dodge or attack, you can't do both unless you want a single beetle fight to last 3 minutes, same with blocking, so the combat loop is Attack a few times > use bandage > attack a few more times > use bandage > dead > repeat for every monster you come across. The combat isn't hard at all, just clunky and needs tuning. The lack of stamina also leads to more frustration because when you die and lose everything, you spend around 6 minutes running back to your corpse just to almost die again because you're either cold or hot cause you don't have resources to build a shelter, it's an endless death loop, all due to stamina tuning.

Also don't bother taming a mount because it dies in 2 hits from a fucking ant.",1680451966,1680451966,False,2,2,0.486556142568588257,0,True,False,True

The Good:
The world is quite large, the combat is not bad, the building is good, the enemies are fairly diverse, Repairing is good - if things aren't too damaged it's a free repair; however, if something is significantly damaged or entirely broken you'll need the corresponding materials to fix it.

The Bad:
There really isn't anything bad - I haven't come across any bugs at all, other than actual enemies. 

I hate drowning, but that's also my fault since it tells you that you can't swim. Thankfully all of your gear stays on your little grave stone at the edge of the water where you died and you can get all your loot back.

My biggest issue with the game is the death loop and travel time associated with it. Once you die, it can be very difficult to go out and get your stuff. This was much more of an issue early game but still becomes an issue later as well. There is no option to spawn near where you died and it could take multiple more deaths just to return back to your backpack. For me, on one occasion, it took almost 2.5 hours to recover from a death loop. Just to call myself out on this issue, some of this was personal problems...I kept forgetting to put down a new bed or call my house over to me when I got closer to a new tree so I kept having to travel across the whole world on a few occasions which is a very lengthy process. My only suggestion here would be to allow for multiple spawn points or just give an option to spawn in a random location near your death. If I am the only one that experiences this issue, then absolutely leave it the way it is and I will try harder to ""get good"". 
Another thing lacking for me at this point would be a questline of sorts for those that enjoy direction but was not necessary for me. 
Multiplayer and singleplayer were both almost flawless with very little issues and super fast loading times. Only multiplayer issues I had with all 25 hours was that when I, as the guest (not host), open up any chest, a lot of the time I could only see some, none, or half of what was in the chest and I would just have to swap places with something in my inventory to see what was actually there. 
Final point of contention for improvement would be the mounts. I like the mounts but there probably needs to be more interaction, harder taming process per later stage mount, and the ability to use each mount differently. The things I would like to see is the spider being able to climb vertically, the mounts not be so squishy that a late game spider get killed with full health by a regular early game carpenter ant, and all mounts having specialized uses and attacks while riding them.
At this state of the game, I would give it an 8/10. As content is released and the world is expanded, it could easily become one of my go-to games.

Ridiculous fall damage applied at short drops, water that rapidly kills you if it gets past your head, and melee combat that feels clunky and inaccurate like hit detection on a ps2 game. And you can't easily pick up crafting resources that you're standing neck to. You have to look directly at them with the cursor to pick them up. Not near them, not on the edge of them. Get your cursor directly over them, almost centered, then you get the prompt to pickup  the item.

I laughed at all the reviews saying this game is better than Grounded. At least Grounded lets you climb, walk, and land on every blade of grass. I tried to jump down to a large leaf and passed right through it, falling to my death.

Oh you want to claim this spot to build? You can't just build anywhere you want. First you must arbitrarily climb to the top of this tree.

Is it nice to look at when you first start the game? Sure, the environment and graphics are pretty. That doesn't make it any less janky or any more playable. It's a nice distraction until you have to start playing though.

Pros:

- Pleasant visuals and pretty, atmospheric music.
- Fluid animations.
- Alongside Grounded - great idea for the game.

Cons:

- Horrible combat system with spammable enemies with auto aim. Completely useless block, very very very limiting your actions stamina system, another combat that heavily relies on dodge rolls. Welcome to the circus.
- Useless, weak mounts not worth the time or the resources to posses them.
- Silly gameplay design - Water kills you almost instantly, you can't craft armor by yourself, enemies spawn every day in the same spot, you need to carry with you different sets of armor to change them instantly as well as weapons when fighting with different enemies or... weather...
- Some important environment objects have no collision... Like leafs. Year 2000 called, it want's it lack of collision back.
- This game is not doing a great thing convincing you that you are small. I felt like I was normal sized human trapped in woods with huge insects instead.
- Couldn't even figure out how to use advanced rotation in building mode. Game is not telling you how to do some basic stuff.

I had felt while playing this game that it's some kind of a student project for school instead of a product of some professional game dev studio.

Overall, very frustrating experience... And I don't think I play games to be frustrated.

Things I like:
The base moving feature in the tree tops, very nice.
The visual style.
Gear and crafting progression.

Things I'd like improved:
Combat-Right now it's too stamina draining to block much. I am not sure if there is even a parry mechanic.
Pets/Mounts-too expendable.

Games I would compare this to:
Valheim (UI and combat---though it's better in Valheim)
V-Rising (map and pvp mechanics, expendable mounts)
Conan Exiles (building, pets)
Ark (pets)

1. Game rating: 10/10.
2. Performance: Smooth.
3. Graphics: Amazing.
4. Open World: Huge.
5. Game feels like the movie Epic, also feels like the game Grounded.
6. Is it worth buying? Absolutely yes.
7. Can you swim in water? No unfortunately.
8. What is the combat like? Feels a lot like Monster Hunter.
9. Is this game violent? There is blood when you attack things and when you receive damage yourself.
10. Game soundtrack: Beautiful.
11. Are there quests? Yep.
12. Can you tame you're own pets? Yes, you can.
13. Building feels very much like Grounded.
14. How difficult is Smalland?  Can be very easy to die, whether it's from lacking food or getting eaten by aggressive bugs. If you don't like being attacked all the time, there is a peaceful mode setting where nothing attacks you unless you attack them first.
15. Lots of content so far even though it's just come out.
16. Smalland VS Grounded differences: In Smalland, graphics are far more realistic than Grounded. In Grounded, you play as a character in you're own back yard where you've been shrunk like the movie Honey I Shrunk The Kids. In Smalland, it's more surviving in the open wilds but being super small.
17. Is there any character customisation? Yes, you can fully customise you're character.
18. How long does it take before you're tools break? It's at a reasonable durability but it is a bit frustrating. Best to build a base behind the armourer guy's place on the edge of the cliff. That's where I built my base and it's got quite the view. 
19. How many players can be in one world at a time? Answer is 10.
20. Can you host private servers for just me and my friends and family? Yes, but make sure when you make and start an existing world, make sure that online mode is toggled to enabled and put a private password in. For you're friends to join you, they must click on the join server next to create then toggle 'friends.' They'll see it, put in the password the host did and you're good to go! ;-)
21. Survival Instinct in this game feels very much like the newer Tomb Raider games where you look for items.
22. Would children be safe to play Smalland? I'd say so, not too bad in terms of violence but it can be pretty scary when you see a massive spider coming after you and it does terrifying music like a horror movie...okay...I'm not helping am I? Nah, you'd be right mate. Get the game then see if it suits in nicely for you're child. Play it first before you're child.
23. How do you unlock more recipes? Simple, get something you haven't collected yet like an ant head will give you a cooking recipe, things like that.
24. When you press F if you are using keyboard and mouse, the second you collect say, wood, hold F immediately after collecting an item to collect everything nearby.
25. On Keyboard and mouse, the V button is to toggle survival instincts to see things by name nearby such as wood, Sprouts/Fiber, Resins etc. Press V again to turn Survival Instincts off. 
26. If you fall in water and die, you're gravestone should appear on land nearby.
27. Apparently, I might be wrong about this, but I think I remember another player saying this, while using survival instincts or getting close to a mob, you can see their strengths and weaknesses. Correct me if I'm wrong devs lol.
28. Finally, I'll say this once...when you play Smalland, collect everything, build a base fast, make padded armour, craft a campfire and workbench at you're base so you can eat better food, repair tools and craft better items. And please, please make beds as soon as possible, interacting with you're bed will not only set you're spawn point but you can also sleep through the night, keep in mind when sleeping to the next day, you're hunger goes way down. To be able to sleep in multiplayer, every player must have a bed, by doing this, you can sleep. In the beginning, if you are struggling with food all the time, make a hatchet and chop down the edible mushrooms, it will only put you're hunger up a little bit before you get the campfire to cook but hey, it's a start right?

WISHLIST:

1. Food takes much longer to go down.
2. You can swim in water.
3. More food is available in the open world and regenerates/spawns back faster.
4. More building options.
5. Railings as an option in building to stop you from falling off the edge of a balcony or cliff edge base.
6. An option to turn blood on and off so younger players can play Smalland safely.
7. A much larger inventory space.
8. Skill tree's such as survival instincts, combat etc.
9. Custom world settings such as setting the game difficulty from Easy, Intermediate, Hard, Creative, Survival etc.
10. Expanding the open world map size over time with a larger variety of content. Also maybe new worlds/maps with different biomes like in Ark Survival Evolved?
11. Voice lines when you chat to NPC's but that doesn't bother me too much.
12. Emotes.
13. Climbable surfaces. Games like Uncharted, Tomb Raider and Horizon Zero Dawn had really good climbing involved. I thought it might be a really good idea to add something similar to that in Smalland if the devs are willing to do that, that'd be amazing. Crafting new tools such as pickaxes, grappling hooks to climb up, wall run etc.
14. Steam workshop creations/mods.
15. More players can join a world beyond the 10 limit for those that have lots of friends/family to play Smalland with. This will be of no good use for me, because there's not many of my family playing Smalland yet, just 2 so far. But it's perfect really because there is a maximum of 6-7 of us in total. It's already really generous of the devs to make 10 available in multiplayer, maybe 20-40 in total if players want to play online with other players?
16. In world settings, an option to toggle all world settings on and off, for example, you no longer require having to eat food to survive, infinite resources, infinite tool durability, things like that.
17. A much larger hotbar just like in Grounded where you can flick through pages of different hotbars.

This game is simply stunning to look at, fun to play and is a must buy, get it on sale or right away, it's that good!

UPDATED REVIEW:

There is actually more than enough food around the place, especially near spawn where the big owl statue is, lots of edible mushrooms. Second day in the game and we are feeling much more comfortable knowing what to do a little better. There are also seasons in the game I've noticed, we are currently in the Autumn season. Amazing game so far, can't get enough of it, really amazing. A huge thank you to the Smalland team for making such a wonderful game! 2 thumbs up from me.

If you are running away from bugs, you can slide while sprinting if you hold C at the same time then jump. If you're struggling with Smalland, always search on google or whatever you use to search, it helps heaps. Smalland is such a great survival game, it's so addictive, turns out, it's my favourite survival game of all time. If you want to get the harder resources to make better things, switch to peaceful mode so nothing attacks you unless you attack first, once you have the rare resources, travel back to base or make another base so you can craft you're new items. ;-) 
Apparently there's a way to be able to fly/glide around the place, must be an armour piece or something, not sure yet but soon to discover. :-D

Honestly, this game surprised me in a huge way, didn't expect it to be this good. More content will be implemented into Smalland on the roadmap. A must buy!

5/5

Well today I played with my friend some hours for the first time. I have to say I had much more difficulties in grounded than here. You dont really need the blocking in combat. Multiplayer worked really fine, no problem. Also for early access we had no glitches. Plants are regrowing every day at same spot so you get ressources pretty easy in this game. The only negative aspect might be that this makes the game a bit generic and also animals responing on same spots way too often. The crafting and building makes fun in the game. I cannot tell about the story, since we forgot about that while surviving and exploring around.

768200,135838879,76561198043113526,117,8,878,0,716,1701674895,"Edit: Let me clarify something: It is negative because the things I did find negative are pretty game breaking - at least for me. You might not mind, but I do. If those things are changed I will change my review. Until then: It is negative because I do not think it is worth playing in current state. While bugs aren't the issue, it is missing a lot of things other early access games had at launch. Doesn't mean I think its horrible or bad or not worth it at all - it means in its current state, things are janky and rickety and some things are not currently worth it or missing and can make or break the game. Chill out. 

I'm almost on an ""Eh"" for this. That being said. Would I recommend it? Somewhat - but with caution.

The game is fun, it's beautiful. The bugs are realistic, the character models are pretty good and all around it's a fun game. 
Sort of finished it, playing co-op the entire time with my husband. Here's my personal opinion/things I noticed.

The positive:

-The buildings look good, it doesn't take much to build a relatively large base. The materials are easy to get and it didn't take too long for me to build it up.
-Along with building: movable tree bases. Claim a tree, build a base, find another tree on the other side of the map? Base moves to that tree. It works well and is nearly seamless! Downside - the trees have a rideable blimp and if you're trying to get back to help a coop buddy, could be like a 5 min run just to get down from the tree
-Seasons! So few of these games have seasons! Seeing everything covered in snow and worrying about weather was really cool! The map is beautiful!
-Combat: The bugs are somewhat hard, but it wasn't terrible. It does tune to your  players so they get harder if you have a coop. So be careful venturing alone as suddenly you're fighting an enemny with nearly double the health alone
-Armor: really cool looking, the weapons look nice, there is a nice variety with the animations being really good!
-The pets are really, they have a use and there is mounts. More of that below

The not so good (though some of these could potentially be easily tweaked/fixed down the line
-Water. It's mentioned. You can't swim. While this isn't necessarily game breaking, you die instantly if you fall in. That means if you fall in on accident by sliding off a rock you're dead. That's it. You have to find your body somewhere at the edge of that same rock. It's irritating considering the movement is somewhat floaty
-Coop - while it works well, you dont' share progress. Example: Me and my husband killed a boss, only he got the loot, only he got credit. It wasn't an easy fight and we'd have to do it again for me to get the same credit. There is no way to group, no way to ally or anything. You are two players on the same map.
-mounts/pets: There is mounts and pets you can get though they are relatively useless. You can tame a lady bug but it doesn't ave any more health than the wild ones do, in other words you can one shot it on accident or something else can. My first two tames were tossed into the water by a passing grasshopper that wasn't even attacking it directly. You can't control each other's tames or mount together on bugs that are pretty clearly big enough for you both, but minor gripe. Just means I can't rescue my husband's pet if he does since I can't move it.
-Armor - isn't craftable. You have to find the npc, see what they need, leave, go across the map f**ing off 50000 miles to get the ingredients you need, come back to buy your armor. With some of them being cold/hot based some might be useless when it's winter since you're going to be freezing - though not a huge deal
-gathering materials: the first big upgrade you need is way too hard to get being between a bunch of higher level/powerful bugs and it was a lot of dying trying to just get the first upgrade to be able to fight those bugs
-bugs have weaknesses to weapon types (slashing, piercing, etc) not a huge deal, but it requires you to carry like 4-5 different types of weapons at all time. It gets annoying. Inventory space is somewhat limited so the first row of your inventory + food, healing items, any tools you need plus some extra building just in case items - 1/3 of your inventory is just necessities leaving you not much space for looting. Please, please please devs stop doing this! Let me have my 'tools' hotbar, at least one not count as inventory space and have it be just hotbar! Omg it'd solve so many annoying issues. It's like valheim where your equipped stuff stays in your inventory.

One final request/gripe I have that's more personal choice. I want the option to customize my server. Let me make drop rate higher, bugs easier, I don't want to drop stuff on death, days longer, seasons shorts, etc. Every other survival game allows this. Let me play my lan game how we want. If I want it super cheesy or if I want to suffer, let me choose.

That being said, I was in the original Alpha and bought this on release, and I'm still sticking by to hopefully see some changes. It's got amazing promise! Please please don't let us down!",1680307079,1680390781,False,198,6,0.778342247009277344,16,True,False,True

There is a lot of unjustified criticism, but more on that in a moment.
Again the four apocalyptic horsemen, sandbox, open world, survival, crafting. Anyone who launches a title like this needs a unique selling point so that the game stands out from the crowd, so that it's not the umpteenth Minecraft, Ark, 7DtD etc.
And those are the features of this title that make it stand out from the crowd.
Yes, you die in the water, but as a survival player I have to adapt.
Yes, I can only have armour built by NPCs, but as a survival player I have to adapt.
But that's the way it is with survival games.
I don't want another Grounded, because Grounded already exists, and it does what it does very well. For 25€, the game has already given me enough entertainment that the price is absolutely justified. The level design is well done and visually the game doesn't have to hide either. It plays solidly and I haven't had any game-breaking bugs so far. The balancing still needs work, but that's what Early Access is for.
To cut a long story short, I've paid a lot more for much worse games that weren't Early Access and if you're up for an open world survival crafting game and aren't a pussy, then go for it, it's only 25€ after all.",1680389517,1680389517,True,0,0,0.456553786993026733,0,True,False,True

Ever since the same Valheim craze that got a lot of us into the genre I couldn’t help but unhealthily binge through so many heavy hitters in the genre like Conan and Ark and what have you. I still feel like these much smaller games always scratch that same itch/high i’m always hunting from Valheim. Much like to dunkey’s credit, if it has a grapple hook it’s 10/10 and this game is no exception. 

The progression feels fantastic and i greatly appreciate the lack of upgrading weapon power as that was always something that felt more like a chore in some games. I greatly appreciate this system in this game of simply crafting the weapon and it’ll last you till the next tier. If they do add the ability to upgrade weapons i hope it’s just to harvest resources faster and nothing else, still locking higher tier resources between higher tier tools. 

Additionally the combat of the game feels very satisfying, despite the sometimes silly AI of the insects. Sometimes they may break in certain terrain due to slopes or elevation but i’m sure that can be fixed in some patches. Other wise tanking fights can quickly get you killed where as strategically evading and attacking when you have openings, recognizing how quickly an enemy can attack, all feels incredibly rewarding and satisfying.

If you are at all a fan of the genre it’s a fantastic game that i imagine can only get better as updates come along.

This was all in my time in single player. Still not finished with the game but i am definitely working on it.",1680388449,1680388449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was not aware of the game until 2 days before early access and I went in not knowing what to really expect.  The survival aspect of Smalland is among the best I have come across.  

The world feels dangerous and mysterious and you need to think ahead to prepare for storms and expeditions.  The creatures in the world are interesting and fairly dangerous.  Combat is a bit clunky but is ok overall.  The world is beautiful to look at and the music adds to the fairy theme.  

I have a particular interest in building in survival games and at first it seemed limited however once you unlock the tier 2 building pieces you are given many more options.  I really enjoyed building my fairy house and putting little camps around the map to shelter in.  

Overall I feel the game is worth the price in its current state.  There is currently a lot to explore and I have not come across any game breaking bugs.  Some minor bugs exist like sounds where there are no creatures etc... but nothing that really takes away from the experience.

One tip for new players is to add markers to your map for important creatures / resources or to mark caves and tunnels for shelter.",1680387966,1680387966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Building: I loved the building aspects it was Pretty easy to hop right into building a Base for me and the Boys, Materials Very basic and easy to get, To later end Building Requiring you to go to a little more difficult areas to obtain and Build upgrades, It was a perfect Happy medium in my opinion.

Combat: Man Them fucking ants when you start they don't play games, But as you evolve, Grab better Gear Mine was Making that Epic Stone Spear and Stone Hammer Along side the Stone armor, You really start Taring through stuff with easy if you actually use the dodge mechanic, I Feel there should be More Weapons But For a Alpha This is fantastic

Tames: Man I feel the tames need a rework, As after taming them, They die with in a few hits, Even the Geckos Which essentially are the Tanks, I feel some such as the Spider Should be able to Climb most surfaces and the Geckos, As i mean when you're running for your life they Do that shit chasing you anyways haha, The Flyers The flyers is a huge one for me I tamed the Damselfly I'm Not a Fan at all on how it doesn't at least Hover over water, And the Stam usage for Flying Should be WAY less then what it is you can even stay airborne for 10 seconds without The stam Gauge being fully depleted, I feel if you've Worked your way to Flying mounts The feel or freedom and flying around should be way more rewarding then what it is jsut with the Freedom of tames, I have no complaints on some of the starter tames, The ladybug COULD be more tanky then taking 2 hits from stuff and dying as they are essentially the extra Back pack and the Flew mech is kind of garbage all everything seems to chase your Tame prior to you hitting them, Let the lady bugs fly away give them a change lol. 

All and all then are Some of my insights From Gameplay, To Combat, To tames.
Pros : Great mechanics Very Fun,
Building is Fun and easy to get the hang out (More building pieces would be stellar Yet not needed currently
Great Game for a More Peaceful setting of enjoyment in a tiny world

Cons: Combat Could be reworked Some what for Stam usage (Maybe allow some kind of skill system To be able to Level up Stam Hp isnt really needed. Just Stam seems to be the biggest Set back For Most features Such as Gliding, Combat, And Running. All Should be More Reduced Amounts then what they are.  (Opinion Based)

Mounts: The Mounts Are in need of some Buffs from (Stam And or Stam Usage reduced Exponentially Especially Flyers Where it seems there is no freedom to Actually Fly) 
Health On Tames Needs to be incresed as EVERYTHING attacks your tames except for things such as LadyBugs
Add in a Tame Aggro System In the sense of, If i'm riding a Gecko Other geckos should be passive To My tame and I Unless i demount Then Of Course Let the battle Commence, This would offer more Enjoyment and freedom. 
Lady Bugs: The Only Extra Bag space in the game that dies in a few hits and EVERYthing attacks it lol, Its flee Mech and Horrid and it never gets away Being such a essential Tame It;d Rework the HP and Buff it after being tamed, And or just change the flee Mech to then Vanishing as they fly away during battle Then players can Use the (Pet Whistle) To recall them when its safe, I've yet to tame one and have it live a Farming trip even being right below base Everything wants that lady bug booty.
Traversal: Things that can climb walls rocks logs, Things that should be able to walk on ceilings etc etc Suchs as Spiders and geckos Need to have these Traversal options When tames As they Really Suck but when you have to run through Every single Hostile thing that wants to kill them, Again pointing back at the stam, Stam reduction is needed as everything chasing you doesn't have stam apply and they almost always Get a few hits in Leading to your never ending doom when you bump into that Next Black window on your Huntman spider.

Multiplayer:  So This could be a Self issue Which i have Great Internet and am joining people in the same state and near by ive tested multiply different Servers, The pings Always Seem to be 999 For the Server Ping and where as 99% of all games i run at a 20-30ms Lat, Where as here the normal Seems to be 120-200. (Could totally be a me issue just not understanding why it would happen as it doesnt in any other game i play and Speed tests I should Def have the req net to run flawless connection, Ive even tried VPNS Nothing Seems to work.

HOTFIX ASAP Please : So IDK if this is a BUG or not, Even though your Great Tree is Claimed And Set to Private Other Players can bring a Building hammer up and destory Your boxes and buildings, Bumped into this last night, Maybe it was just a Server bug at that time but It was pretty unsettling Grindup my armor sets and having someone be able to Just break my box and take stuff as my tree is set to Private, You should make it to where They have to Request To take your hotair Balloon Up to your Tree so playing in others servers trying to help would be More safe.

Pros:
The game is beautiful

I like that they made bugs weak vs A and resistant vs B so you feel the need to craft more than 1 weapon type (1 thing it does a lot better than it's competition aka grounded)

Cons:
The combat feels horrible and frankly boring

The movement as a whole (walking/running/jumping) feels clunky ESPECIALLY if you need to disengage (run) from something and it's pushing you.... The more I think about the movement, the more I'm wondering what engine they're on (cause it feels SO bad)

The building snaps are way too sensitive

The story is non existent (feels pointless)

You can unlock gear (won't spoil it) but then have to go to a specific crafter on the map to have THEM make it (giving us that less to do in our base)... which (the base) already feels underwhelming (I usually run back, dump my stuff, cook my food, sleep, then right back out(which is not my MO, I'm USUALLY a super elaborate, set it up perfect base kinda guy).... if it wasn't for storage I wouldn't see my base for hours to be frank)

I absolutely love/hate the water system.... I love the added challenge, but HATE how.... bad it works? I know that's a weird thing to say so I'll explain it in short... I love that we have that extra obstacle.... HATE how sensitive it is.... instead of water = perma death, I personally would rather see something like an extremely short swim bar THEN you drown(like you hit deep water? you got 5 seconds to swim, if you're further than that- gg).... but it's alot easier to just code water = drop to bottom = dead, which is presumably why we got what we got



At the end of the day, all this game did was make me want to make a new grounded save..... what I will say in it's favor is this.... If I could take ALL the grounded stuff (combat, story, better build mechanics, more build options) and have it in THIS graphics, I absolutely would...

So my hope is because it's EA... they take all the feedback, and polish it... alot... and maybe a year from now that's what we'll have and I'll revisit the game... Subnautica and Grounded took awhile to get where they got, and they ended up 2 of my favorite games all time in this genre

But as always with my reviews I base them on if I could have my time and money back... and if so, it's a thumbs down... and as I can only judge what's available today, not what might be coming/might get patched.... this one is exactly that, a thumbs down",1680365143,1680365143,False,0,1,0.376859813928604126,0,True,False,True

Overall its a great game but there is stuff that need some tweeking! Its understandeble since the game just came out on early access!

So i have been playing for couple of hours and the stuff that i have found so far that needs tweeking from the perspectiv of a solo player:

Respawn rate of ants is one way of fixing the vast amounts of ants around the starting area.

the hitboxes of larger creatures. There is countless of times i have seen my weapon ""hit"" the creature bit i did not connect.

The attack tracking of of creatures. A good example is the red ants attack, you will still be hit by its ""charge"" attack even if you circle around it.

Since its really difficult to aquire flint and bark with so meny difficult creatures in the area and on the way to that area! My suggestion to resolve that, would be to add a few nodes of flint in the smaler beach areas.

the controlles for mount. I have only tried the grasshopper. But the stering is like a tank. it would be much more enjoyable if you could use the camera movement. But add a turn radius.

The tamed creatures spawn together with you in bed when you logg in. If you could have it spawn with in a radius would be really nice!

This is the things that have bothered me the most. i can add more if i find more!
Have a great day!

We spent 5 hours feeling the game out.  First of all if you are running the game on High graphic settings, we knocked it down from Ultra in both of our setting as to not tax the game, the game is graphically stunning.  The developers have really put their heart in to the scenery of the game.  Game play is pretty straight forward once you get a feel of the key binding layout, and paying attention to the right weapon for what ever fighting situation you find yourself in.  Being able to press V and scan for resources is an excellent tool.
At this point in our game play my Buddy and I can think of only two suggestions for the developers< 1, Where your spawn point is set is where you should be when you log in to the game.  I found myself at a different Great Tree that i had claimed, even after I had unclaimed the Great Tree because my spawn point was at my Buddies Great Tree.  Each time I logged out I would end up at the Great Tree I initially claimed.  It also showed me as still being the owner of the base even after I had previously unclaimed it.  2, Fast travel would be a great tool to have to get back to your base/spawn point.

Smalland is a survival game with a focus on exploration,  having both promise and it's fair share of issues. I adore the setting and premise of this title. You are a Faefolk type creature tasked with aiding in the recovery of a key to a chest which holds the one item which can save your queen from her ailments. The mystery of who stole the key is one that truly brings into question the character of each faefolk you meet, and even the intention behind sending you on such a quest to begin with. That is the only narrative point I have encountered thus far, but I do look forward to future exploration of this in the future.

On the note of gameplay, if you have played Ark Survival you may be familiar with some aspects of the taming system, crafting, and survival mechanics. However this is where the similarities fall away. The combat within smalland shows true promise, taking a darksouls-esque dodgeroll and even a slide mechanic into it's arsenal. I love the potential here, however the execution is currently somewhat half-baked (as would be expected at this point in development). the enemy attacks can currently hit you mid dodge which makes timing these dodges feel cumbersome given the monotonous attacks of swarms of akin enemies and less than generous anticipation frames. fixing one or the other should be a step in the right direction, however more attack variety from enemies would be a very welcome addition. On the side of combat based UI it can be difficult to tell how much of your health has been restored or depleted given the healthbar's hasty drop. A more clear indication (having a yellow bar underlay the red then decline over the course of 1 or fewer seconds) may help ease this in tense battles. the dodge and slide have little weight to them, I will study this further to see if it's a matter of animation or merely sound design (an easier tweak imo). All of the mechanics in place here have the greatest potential for a satisfying and enjoyable combat system that has me waiting eagerly to see more.

Combat itself can feel rather jank at times. While the light attack seems to function as intended, the heavy attack can cause some enemies to be displaced (to the sides) before the attack has an active hitbox. Making the attack nearly useless. This makes ranged combat more ideal, and can make close combat encounters feel rather spammy, with some gravity given to previously mentioned issues.

Structures and the environment are a sight to behold. Those wanting a house pleasing to the eye will not have to sink nearly as much time into this aspect given the incredible assortment of stucture options (I love the roofs and windows <3 ). Though I have had friends mention limitations in selection while making complex houses with more modern concepts. You can tell the art team (artist?) put a lot of attention into making every bit of these look the part, and it cannot go unnoticed! I mean, honestly, wow! The environments likewise feel at home within the theme, making this expansive map feel alive.

Traversal of this massive world is a daunting task in the beginning, however both tames and gear options do alleviate this as you progress. A primary issue within this game and many similar titles is the aggro range of enemies and their placements near your home base. Having enemies nearby can make gathering food more accessible, the range at which enemies can sense and begin to hunt you is incredibly large. being chased by beetle and ant alike for what can feel like much too far from their location of origin. This is something that can lead to you having swarms of enemies, compounding combat issues. Players can be brought into aggro range as soon as they leave their base at the tree nearest spawn. leaving you rushing out the door for your nearest hiding spot for safety given the volume of nearby enemy swarms.

Crafting works, however the menu is buried behind your inventory, in a heap of tabs. Before anything else I would like a binding, and another hotbar. Some recipes feel as though they're a bit backwards, demanding more resources for a lesser effect.

THIS GAME DID MULTIPLAYER RIGHT! Everything you build and own, binds to your character. When you invite a friend onto your world, their gear and home come with them! THIS IS AMAZING! I can't think of any reason why this sort of thing hasn't been implemented before! There are a couple of exceptions that need ironing out though. Trees are claimed by players as their home base, and if you and your friend both have the same taste in real-estate, the player who joined first will overwrite your home. I HAVE A SOLUTION! simply add a discovery system for these trees, when you join the server the game checks if you discovered another nearby tree and have the base spawn there. provide a warning dialogue for the player if they haven't discovered a nearby tree, and that should be all good for most. It'll take a sec to get things working right, but it reduces the amount of exceptions the user has to think about.

Though my initial BETA review may seem mostly negative, citing bugs and issues, I love the concepts this game employs and have enjoyed my first full day. This game is a blast, however the longevity of enjoyment will depend on whether or not the issues mentioned here are comfortably resolved. This game has so much promise, I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for us in the future.


DAY 2: entered unrecoverable death spiral due to enemy aggro ranges, loot cannot be recovered. at least the loot will be recoverable with later gear.

Thank you for checking out my initial review, posted on the 2nd day of release.

This wouldn't be too much of an issue, except literally everywhere you go there are bugs that will aggro on you from a fair distance and they're all much faster and do much more damage than you do, so your only option is to run as far as you can from where you encountered them, which also means you have a 95% chance of running into another bug or handful of bugs that decide to join in the chase like you just stole a sawyer bug's purse. 

Very rarely the bugs will end up attacking each other, but it only happened once in the time I played, even when I've been chased by 3-4 different types of bugs at the same time.

Combat essentially boils down to beating something until it dies without trying to dodge, unless you enjoy every small fight taking 5 minutes while you roll around in the dirt between unreasonably long attack animations and trying to dodge wide because some bug attacks can somehow hit you behind them. This leads to you losing 50%~ of your health to every fight, and this becomes even more of an issue when you realise there's no early healing item and no early shield-type item (as far as I found within the first 2 hours of playing, but maybe that's just me).

It's likely to be a very good game after a few updates, but the current combat system makes the game a frustrating slog of try to gather > get attacked > run or lose 50% of your health > run into more insects, run out of stamina, die > respawn > run back to your gravestone > get attacked > run or lose 50% of your health > repeat.

The building pieces look great, though the snapping is a bit of a gamble on whether or not it'll work, but overall building is relatively enjoyable if you can manage to get resources without being accosted every 3 minutes by very costly fights, either because you spend forever trying to kill the bugs without taking too much damage, you die trying to fight them, or you spend time running away from them.",1680317296,1680317296,False,2,0,0.454374223947525024,0,True,False,True

The models are pretty good, and though the main character animation and features could use a little work, I am pleasantly surprised how quickly I was picking up the controls.

However, my biggest complaint is as a visually impaired person, the icons on the UI desperately need improvement. The low contrast of brown icons with the thin item models is very difficult to discern what is what. Since the game does not pause when I open the UI menu, it makes quick swapping on my hotbar VERY hard. A colorful glow and thicker item outlines in the UI could help someone like me a lot identify what Im looking at quicker. 

I have a similar complaint for the environment itself. though beautiful, it looks all very similar early game and it makes navigation slow and kind of confusing for me. It was hard to understand which tree with mushrooms I was at without constantly opening the map. Like, yes, I should have to use the map, but there needs to be more visual disparity in areas, is only in how they are lit if the foliage must remain similar. Like maybe right over the creek, it is much brighter/has more direct sun because there is less leaf and tree cover.

Also... it is always raining, it feels like. The weather could use a bit of adjusting, because I got storms and rain before I had a chance to really figure out the building system.

OK so i beat what ever was left of the content and i must say i am excited to see what else the devs are gonna put in and adjust... i did find a bug with the last mount or pet the damsel fly, you can fly infinitely after stamina runs out and push space bar again... that being said all the pets are pretty much useless after you get first set of wings, i also found the pets annoyed me the most. grasshopper can jump once and drains entire bar of stamina and then like 3 seconds before it starts filling again. didnt even bother with the salamander, as for the wolf spider i was really exited for and then very disappointed by. cant climb anything not very fast just sucks like was hoping for more. as mentioned before about damsel fly the bug for flying infinitely its other wise useless and very weak. all bosses super easy, uh no problems there kinda simple fight patterns not very exciting... the lay out of everything is great and looks even better graphics wise.

The screenshots do not really represent the graphical stuff in game. On ultra, it does not look like the trailer, the gifs posted, or the screenshots, so that is a bit misleading as well. I am not a graphical person, but even having everything set to ultra, and it still looks rough, im still getting framerate issues which means the balancing of post processing effects was not benchmarked properly.

The core gameplay is there, and it is early access, but there is some issues and questioning of what made the developers choose to go that route.

for one, you need to constantly use your antenna senses, which is cool to find things near you, but its obviously been put in because you need it for game mechanic approaches the developers decided on. You can't cut down obvious things, dont try to jump on leaves, you will fall directly through them. you cannot swim, you cannot vault or walk up anything at shin level, storms are annoying because you die quickly and if you are exploring you need to backtrack quickly to your base which affects pacing.

Crafting is a gated mechanic like the way valheim is, but to get more resources in a richly vegetated areas, they are sparse and force you to run long distances (note storms above). Which would usually be fine, but some crafting mechanics feel gated to stall progress instead of keeping good pace. This was most likely done due to early access and to keep players playing longer.

Also the lack of world controls is kind of a pain. Even settings to lessen hunger a bit, or turn down storm chances would be good.

With all that said, I'm not saying its a bad game, but its super grindy out of the box, and punishing in areas where its a bit unnecessary. you will die a lot, and for very ridiculous reasons.

I know that is a lot of constructive critism, but im going to recommend this game for now and keep it installed, but at its current state, its....alright. its not good, but its not bad either. It really just needs some polish, and that is probably why the developers put it on early access was for reviews like these. If you got a group of friends you can play with, I would say your time will be a lot easier, but be ready to grind, and corpse jump and corpse run because you will die from storms, fall damage from falling through platforms, die from drowning in puddles, etc.

Also, there needs to be a way to delete corpse icons. in my 2.5 hours, i have my map littered with them, which is a problem.

I do recommend, just go into this game with it being early access in mind. I think with some polish and taking in player feedback, this will be a really good survival title.

Pros
-Interesting world. Lots of flora and fauna, models are made well
-Audio is a 7/10, I have encountered some audio bugs, such as sounds from a bee present after killing it (no others around)
-Lighting is good, graphics as a whole are 8/10 for the style of game
-Concept is fantastic. If you've played Grounded or Valheim and liked them, this is worth a try.
-Having a map and being able to place markers is great. I wish the markers would stand out a bit more on your compass.

Cons
-Movement is clunky and needs refinement, such as jumping. They need better jump control. 
-Performance is 2/10 overall, all things considered, being 2023, there should be no FPS drops for a game like this. Going from 120 fps in one area to tanking down to 30fps with jittery camera movement even when FPS returns to normal. Camera movement overall needs to be smoothed out. THIS GAME NEEDS A LOT OF OPTIMIZATION YET.
-Combat is absolutely atrocious. Generic weapons, unsatisfying hits, hit boxes need work, generic ""swing and hit"" mechanisms, basically keep whacking it with a basic right hand swing until either it or you dies.
-AI of the creatures is just, plain and simple, bad. I hope they put a lot more work into the AI/detection/interaction with the fauna. You can be in the middle of a fight and then the insect will run away to a different spot and disengage/heal/de-aggro

The worst of all.... the saving. Multiple times now I have sat and waited until I get the message ""Character Saved.."" and ""World saved..."", only to reload in the next time having been set back about 2 hours worth of progress because it did not, in fact, save. Or being spawned next to a base that is all the way across the map even though I set a new spawn point before getting off. 

I do not recommend the game in its current state. It needs a lot of work. The snapping of the building system could be refined a bit too. However I will say that I believe this game has a lot of potential to be great. Just not yet.",1680312632,1680312632,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

-Combat is clunky, gathering materials is tedious, stack sizes blow. 
-More of that click prefabs together building. Not a dealbreaker but would have enjoyed more of a making shelter for your action figures out of twigs and leaves as a kid feel.
-Your character starves at a quarter of the speed of light and will tear through enough berries to give a grown adult some high tier diarrhea and still not be full.
-Speaking of the above point, you don't feel tiny, you feel like the world around you is just stupid big. There's no real mechanics that react to your size. No bouncing on leaves, no climbing on stuff a big thing couldn't etc.
-The scale is also all over the place. A ladybug is massive next to a glass bottle. Or maybe the bottle is tiny, or the lantern in a tree is giant? Who knows.

The game is early access, and the developer published their road map on day one. When was the last time ANYONE has done that? The expectations people have had are insane, and the complaints that I see are silly. The game overall is amazing. The combat is challenging and fun, the gear feels like it MEANS something, and the survival aspect is excellent. Below is my Pros and Cons.

Pros:
1) The game is extremely immersive. I actually felt small when entering the world. The map design makes you feel tiny and the scale of things works really well. Rarely do I tilt my camera up, but every now and then I come across a vantage point that really shows how big the world is.

2) The game has a great flow, and the difficulty is on par for an open world survival game. Depending on your skill level, you will either have a hard time dying a lot or you will realize you can't just rush in and kill all the things like some sort of god. After 15 hours, I am about mid tier and it has been a challenge... a fun, terrifying challenge. *Shudders* SPIDERS.

3) Upgrading gear FEELS like an upgrade. What used to take 8+ attacks to kill a bug now suddenly takes 3 or less. This tells me that there are even harder to kill bugs out there and that scares me in a good way.

4) There are some really great quality of life things in this game that I wish others had. For example, the limited inventory space is what is used to determine what you can carry. NOT a small inventory and a weight limit. Or a balloon to take you to the top of the tree you've claimed instead of a 20 minute climb up and down every time.

Cons:
1) The game has a few performance issues. Stuttering when first loading into a world, sometimes a bit of desync when playing with other people, typical stuff like that.

2) Equipment slots do not count as inventory slots. With a small inventory, and a system that requires multiple different types of weapons, you end up with 1/3 of your inventory full of just tools and weapons. Then add food and bandages and you are very limited on how much can be carried.

3) The game seems to be oriented around solo game play. As for yet, I have not found a way to group with friends to start a community. While you can live together just fine, who ever claims the tree controls when you play together. If they log off, the house and everything in the claimed tree disappear.

Overall the game has been a great experience, and I am excited to see whats to come. This is an early access game that I have to keep reminding myself its early access. It has played very smooth for me, though I do know some who have had performance issues. Overall I'd give the game a 9/10.",1680305276,1680305276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I recommend this game, it's been fun playing with Friends and by myself. If you have potato pc, I would defiantly skip this game until you upgrade though for sure. All in all I think it's awesome and am loving it! <3",1680300503,1680300503,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

+ Graphics 
+ Atmosphere, Weather-System & Sound-Design
+ Very intuitive & fun progression system 
+ Crafting (balance between effort & results) - Personally I found it a tad bit too easy to get the final armor-sets


- Combat - It's not good. The stamina system feels like it needs to be redone. If you want to fight without taking harm, you are stuck just using light attacks and rolling away. It prolongs encounters far too long and doesn't really work against groups of enemies, so the outcome of the fight is usually determined by your gear and you will outscale almost all enemies fairly quickly.
- Healing - If combat were to be fixed, healing would need to be nerfed. You can bandage yourself and use healing potions in a bossfight endlessly. I was more or less invincible when fighting the last boss of the early access - It felt very boring, so yeah.. survival is all about resource management and not about skill from my experience.
- Powercreep: You get too strong too quickly, the struggle of the early game was really fun for me personally. 

Overall a great game for its price and I'm looking forward for what's to come in the future. However, I will most likely stop playing now as I have ""achieved"" all there is to achieve in the game as of right now and  there is no incentive to keep on playing.",1680299480,1680299480,True,1,0,0.496732026338577271,0,True,False,True

The good: Visually it looks great | There are decent amount of creatures | Building is simple and quick
The bad: Combat is ridiculous - there's no ''perfect block'' and the pattern for basically every creature is light attack (x1) and roll. Rinse and repeat. | Jumping is weird and feels ''stiff''. It's easy to ''slide'' of an obstacle when jumping. | Most of the foliage is just visual. You can be up high jumping from a branch to a closest leaf just to jump through it and fall to your death. | No swimming. Not having diving is understandable but not being able to tread water makes no sense. | Basic resource gathering is dumb. You'll be spending most of your time running around spamming ''F'' on clovers and wood piles regardless of how strong or advanced you are. | Can't save or pause whenever you want. I suppose your local game runs like a server anyway. You should be able to (at least)pause and save a local game at any time. | It's not optimised that good. The stuttering happens a lot regardless of video settings.| Repetitive design e.g. the trees that are specifically designed to be used for building base (from the 4 that I visited) were exactly the same. 
///Let's say you ignore all that. The worst thing in my opinion is not having leveling/skill system. If you die at a boss all your stuff drops there. Wouldn't be a big deal but the only thing that makes your character strong is gear. So if you lose all your gear after 20 hours you're instantly as weak as you were when you started. 

Obviously everyone loves the idea of the game but in my opinion it's not worth it without core mechanic rework. The road map shows so many upcoming things that are cool but are they worth it if the core's clunky?",1680112320,1680298056,False,167,12,0.696612358093261719,21,True,False,True

Enemies have different attacks and you can dodge with proper timing. Each enemy has a vulnerability that make all the weapons useful depending on the situation. The exploration and resource discovery loop is solid and fun.  

Pets are easy to tame but also easily killed. Treat them as disposable. Don't bother w/ ladybugs for storage; when they die you can't pickup anything you stored so it's just lost. 

Suggestions: 
-Pets disappear and I don't know why. Did they die in a storm because they need to be under a roof or do I lose them automatically on logout? 
-If pets have inventory, they should drop inventory on death
-Ability to name pets 
-The Store All feature needs work. It puts things I dont want moved, like tools. Just look at how V Rising implemented its 'Complusively Sort' button. That's how it should work. If an item is in your inventory and the box, only those items should be transferred. 
-Make the hotbar inventory separate from your regular inventory. The way it swaps the regular inventory around when you use the hotbar is annoying. 
-A craftable backpack would be nice

That said however, right now I'd say its promising but with issues (again Early Access).  So with the caveat of everything I say here is based purely on its current early access state, people should bare that in mind when deciding whether or not to try it themselves.

I wishlisted this game when it was first announced and have kept a loose eye on it up to now, so I was if im honest quite exceited by it and in many ways the game does not disappoint.  It is beautiful, far more mature and RPG'ish in feel that the other tiny person sandbox on the market right now.  There is a character creation or the bare bones of one, that lets you decided how your avatar looks.  Options are fairly limited right now, but it is there nevertheless.

Once your avatar is made you are put in the game you can play on public servers or make a server and password it if you want to play with just friends.  No private servers and pretty much ZERO in terms of options and tweaks to the games for the server you make and that in itself is kind of a deal breaker for me personally as I like to play these games solo, and this despite advertising itself as Single player or Multiplayer is very much NOT balanced for solo play at all.  

Heals are rare, damage is frequent and significant and when you die, which you WILL be assured of that, you then have to run all the way back to your grave to retrieve you inventory.  This also is a deal breaker for me, and would be the first thing I turned off, or used a mod to remove if such options were available.  Corpse runs are an anachronism from old MMO's and are like many of those games best left in the past.

There is an option to have the game be played in Peaceful Mode, where bugs do not attack you unless attacked, but that to me felt like over the top easy mode.  Normal mode however drives home just how many bugs there are, EVERYWHERE and you will get hit many times without ever knowing the bug was there until it is on you, there are not many wide open spaces with a good long field of vision, its dense and overgrown and everything seems to want to kill you, even the nice lady birds, who apparently go super aggressive at night.
There also seem to be some stuttering and FPS issues at times, especially when combat starts, which can be a kicker as as a momentary stutter or lag spike 100% can and will get you killed because combat is fast.  Combat also relies on stamina, which is finite, every run, hit or dodge uses stamina, and against one opponent you are going to have enough against multiple opponents, not even close and you can't really kite per se as running uses stamina, which if you are out of, you cannot do hence every insect (which apparently have no stamina limitations themselves) will catch and hit you .  They also seem to have VERY large aggro radiuses, even when crouching/stealthing.  Enters its radius it looks at you, seconds later it attacks

There are of course positives such as a vast amount of craftables and recipes to discover, many varieties of bugs, also NPC's you can trade to for a variety of things around the map in exchange for materials.  Backpack space doesn't seem to use Encumberence, which is an absolute blessing, so you just seem to be limited by spaces and things stack quite generously.  Also despite the affore-mentioned performance hiccups from time to time the game seemed very stable.

To sum up it left me feeling a little like vanilla Ark without server setting choices, in so much as you are out of the gate potentially out of your depth and facing things WAY beyond you amidst things that are easy or just don't care you are there at all and then the sun goes down and everything goes insane.  Leaving you feeling like the game is good, has potential, but isn't there yet, it needs tweaking, it needs options, it needs some performance passes etc..

the result of which being a feeling of don't do what I did and jump in now, wait a while for some more updates and patches to drop, let it cook a bit more until its done and then it will be worth the wait.",1680249071,1680296093,False,2,0,0.489756524562835693,0,True,False,True

I have been waiting for this game since grounded was in early access and I played through that.  This game needs a decent amount of work still which is fine, the world the developers built is great and the game play is decent (basically the same as you would get from a game like Valhiem).  They need to work on durability of items or an easier way to repair.  I wouldn't mind a repair kit to carry around with me so I don't have to put down foundation and a crafting bench to repair something like a sword or club, just seems dumb...  A fast travel system would be great as well, currently if you want to get back to your base from across the map you need to log out and log back in, this works if you are in sticky situations too but feels super cheesy.

The ""quests"" you get are un-intuitive and a burden to follow.  The story is very basic but hopefully they can expand on that.

Most the quest givers just talk a ton and give you quests that have no quest markers for the first part aside from the bosses.  Finding a tree base just seems to be something you stumble upon, again a good situation for a quest giver to direct you to one of the many big trees in the game.  

I haven't played multiplayer yet so this review is basically on solo play.  It does look however that multiplayer is set up nicely and the base moving system they set up is cool for multiplayer.  

I am going to keep playing and coming back to this game as i hope they plan on improving things based off peoples suggestions.",1680288957,1680288957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I hesitate to compare the two much though, as they have largely different focuses despite similarities. 

Pros: 
Very gorgeuous running on Ultra. First exiting into the Overworld was breathtaking.

I enjoy the music, I think it invokes perfect vibes for the whimsy and danger of the world.

There is actual story and the world has population, its not quite as aimless as some survival fare.

A lot of systems, like building, feel as though they were designed with quality of life in mind. 

Cons: 
No personal progression system ala skills or leveling. Its not always a necessary part of these games, but when you die you drop everything but whats in your hands or on your body. Having progressive skills take some of the sting out of retrieving or remaking items.

Some features, like saving character on command and pause in single player, are missing. I feel as though many are asking for these features, so its likely a matter of time.

This could be me, but theres no lockon which makes controller play just a tad bit more difficult. Soulsbornering vets wont have too much trouble though. Or im just not seeing the button in controls. ymmv.



I think for a just released early access game, theres already a lot of content and a very solid, gorgeous base to expand on. I look forward to seeing how the game grows and progresses.

Combat is fun!
Exploration is REALLY immersive. The general design of everything is really amazing. Cracking job.

Not too hard and not too easy, a good difficulty balance.
The armours and weapons are great! and a good mix of recipes too.


My only cons

1: Building is lack luster and seems to be missing parts? Also the snapping can be quiet awkward. I feel like there could be so much more done to the building mechanics especially in a world like this, there should be more work done to building within the world...  however i love the idea of great trees.

2: The no swimming and die instantly doesn't reaaally make allot of sense... it's very hindering, especially if you accidentally fall into a shallow peice of water carrying good stuff... you're not getting it back.

3: Fall damage is insanley high for something of such small mass. 

4: Some of the bugs move a little awkwardly when chasing you

Currently there is no fast travel in the game. BUT, if you plan to venture out into a dangerous place far from your spawn point you can just quit to menu and re boot your world to spawn back at home with all the loot you acquired (saves travel time and heals). This can also be used mid combat to prevent death or if you're caught out in a storm towards the end of your trip. Once you acquire the Bee chest and can glide, the game becomes easy mode. There becomes almost no point of climbing up the trees anymore because you can always just spawn yourself on top of the one you set as your spawn to travel. 

You can tank the storm with health elixirs and bandages. 

You can avoid using resources to repair tools and weapons by bringing a workbench with you and repairing, then quickly break it back down (just don't let the tool get to half durability).

Overall I had a great time playing, the itch for discovery was certainly there as well as room for creativity (base building).

I HIGHLY recommend this game, if you enjoy survival base building games. My only request is if you do decide to purchase this game, go into your adventure with the mindset that you are helping test and create this games future with your suggestions and critiques. If youre after some sort of polished game that needs NO testing at all, perhaps opt out of seeing early access content.

After about 20 hours of game play, here i am writing a review. So far, my experience has be fantastic. Contrary to what others are saying, you DONT have to repair equipment after every single fight. Thats absurd. You are encouraged to repair often, as once equipment is damaged beyond a certain point, it stops being free, and increases in cost as the damaged increases.

This game is literally a perfect blend of Grounded and Valheim. All the base building mechanics from valheim, along with the mechanic of unlocking recipes by finding new materials. This allows a really nice crafting tree progression for the game, as you conquer new enemies, and explore new areas. Its a way to reward the player for pushing through some tougher scenarios, such as taking on really tough enemies so that you can upgrade your weapons so they will be easier in the future.

The building system is pretty solid, considering its in its infancy. Obviously, its not perfect, as is nothing in an early access game, but the building has enough stuff atm to at least let you be pretty creative with base design. Options exist to turn on and off snap points, giving you full control of how you want structures to behave.

The world is breathtaking. Honestly, ive spent more time staring at the scenery than anything else so far. The map is pretty huge, and with different biomes, so you find yourself seeing new stuff all the time and I just cant help myself but to stop and stare at its beauty.

TLDR; Give this game a go, but only if you understand what an early access game is. Playing Early Access means being able to smile and appreciate what you have, without being so hung up on what you dont. Its coming, relax. This game has much to offer, and can keep you busy for hours if you dig in and enjoy the ride.

Every gem has to be polished before it can shine. as early access players, we are part of the team adding the polish, so make sure to hit up the proper channels and provide your feedback. It really does help.",1680277487,1680277487,True,1,0,0.502512574195861816,0,True,False,True

Got potential, but as of now, this game need a lot of basic QoL updates before i can recommend it.

1. Auto loot/pick up.
This is the most basic thing they need to add to the game ASAP.
I don't know why nobody in the devs team think about this.
Like, why bother using gather button/action but the stuff you ""want"" to gather will drop to the ground, and you need to manually pick them up (using the same button).
I spend so much time looking at the ground and picking all the stuff that i already click to gather or hit using a tool.
Tedious.

2. Lack of interaction in the world.
The world is not immersive enough.
A lot of object and stuff in the world can't be interact with, some even don't have a proper collision, so you can fall or slide from it.
Creature interaction also not that great.
Unlike grounded, where you can interact with most of the stuff in the world, including for resource gathering. Here you can only harvest specific node.
And interaction between creature is more alive / real in grounded. Makes the world more immersive.

3. The ability to swim
Oofff... a lot of water in the map, sometimes with glitchy ground collision. 1 wrong move, and you are drowned.
We can't swim, but the ants can submerge and go pass through it, like it is nothing. Awesome mechanic.

4. Combat and movement feel clunky.
Hit boxes are weird man.
Blocking, jumping, dodging doesn't feel right.

5. and so on, and so on.

tl;dr.
i'll wait for a couple of months/a year.",1680269594,1680269594,False,3,0,0.473657041788101196,0,True,False,True

 I admit I do not leave reviews. But this game really earned it. I have done early access on many games. In fact I just did KSP2. And I must say this was one of the best early access releases I have tried. I had  four people pop in with one game it ran smooth everyone joined up easy no problems. Content is more then I expected (although so more audio dialog could make it nicer but that is a personal preference.) And I am on the discord and the community for this game is excellent almost as great as timberborn and KSP 1 which I hold in my top spots. So now I will just do what everyone really looks at a pro's and con's break down.

  PRO's:

-Amazing beautiful world and great transitions with the biomes 
-Wide variety of wildlife on early access impressive.
-A heck of a lot of craftables as many as a lot of finished games in this same category of games which is awesome.
- I enjoy the combat its pretty straight forward
-small details like sparks off the torches show the dev's love their game and its great to see

Things that need some love:

 - The building placement is clunky and I wish it would snap better
- If you going to have the wildlife so aggressive we should have a wide variety of base defense options. I do not always want to hide up on a tree.  Especially on a char with no wings yet because fall damage is brutal.

Con's

 I personally do not like games where you can not swim and real ly hope this will be added later and maybe rafts.

So all in all this is very much worth the money and I would bet this will grow in to a major hit. Great job dev's thank you for your work it was worth the painful waiting lol.",1680269553,1680269553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Getting started tips: 1) climb and claim a great tree ASAP so you can just move your base around the map as you explore. 2) use your antennae sense ability (hotkey V) alot, it helps you see hidden resources and bug weaknesses/resistances. 3)don't try to go way out too soon. explore your smaller area around the Great Tree you've claimed, get resources, stock up, then plan a journey to the next great tree, move your base by talking to the gnome statue at bottom of tree to claim it, then repeat. 

A few things could be better explained, like the Great Tree base system and the seasons cycle, but there are videos floating around YT that help. Once you figure it out, the Great Tree base system is an amazing feature, allowing you to build an awesome base without the fear of losing it or having to manually start over as you explore further out. 

Jumping is very floaty and I have fallen to my death a few times. Death is not punishing, its a Valheim-esque journey back to your tomestone to get your stuff back. Night time is daaaaark and spoooooky. Haven't made it to winter yet, but I'm guessing you have to prepare like any small woodland creature must.  Combat is also a bit floaty, but there is blocking, dodging, and enemy weaknesses/resistances to figure out. So far, Sawyer Beetles  are the bane of my existence.

More players = stronger enemies >>>AND MORE LOOT!<<<

Taming is cheap, quick and easy, which is good, as you will more than likely lose your companion at least once playing this.

Environment is tough, yet easily manageable once you get familiar, and you can unlock ways to traverse terrain easier.
Getting some of these feels really good, as you might have to work a bit for the good ones.

Most enemies have strengths as well as weakness against certain attacks. These are displayed on the creatures.
Fighting alongside at least one friend makes fights easier, though soloing is not a problem.
Using DODGE is essential. Not learning to DODGE will make you quit fast. Start zone is full of hints. Read them.

So far most QoL features are already in the game. Very unusual for EA games these days.
Simple things like 1-button item transfer/drop and stack splitting with a responsive slider.

I thought my 16GB RAM would be a bottleneck as usual for performance, but running everything on max gives me a smooth 120FPS without stutter even in borderless while streaming on Discord.

I've had at least one friend get stuck underground, but not experienced this myself.
This honestly feels more finished than any EA I've played in the last 10 years, both due to performance and the standard being lowered beyond shameful *coughtheforest cough*.

Its a mix of Grounded , a dash of Valheim and a sprinkling of dark souls. Fairly polished for an early access with more polish then rouge . 

The game may be difficult for those whom the genre is new to but most players will grasp the concept fairly easy . I find the difficulty to be similar to Green hell and fairly balanced .

I'm not a fanboi or paid reviewer .
I stumbled upon this game on steam about a week ago and excitedly awaited its release , as I'm a huge grounded fan .

Mobs are fairly tough but progression seems to flow quite smooth . The beginning tutorial via owl messages helps , but leave something to be desired . A few buggy spots limit access to your corpse from time to time  but overall not too bad . The building isn't as crisp as grounded and I miss the build from storage feature .
Visually its stunning and the sound/score fit the concept perfect .

As of now Id rate the game 7/10 with some frustration that can easily be overcome with time .",1680249366,1680249366,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Smalland is an open world survival craft with a setting similar to Grounded and many gameplay elements resembling Valheim, with a few additions / changes. The experience so far has been really fun, and there's a decent amount of things to do if you're looking for a survival craft open world with combat. At the time of writing, the experience has been a blast while playing with a friend, with only a handful of complaints when compared to similar games of this genre. There's a few bugs (clipping through ground in some places / drowning in an area with no water, which happened rarely) and some frustrations regarding combat balance (which is adjustable with ""passive"" mode, but takes the games really difficult solo experience to a terribly easy one, with no in-between).

If you enjoyed Valheim, Grounded, or Conan Exiles, you're likely to enjoy this game.

[h2]~Adventuring[/h2]
[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Map is truly open-world (not on rails)
 - Starting area has an (okay) introduction to mechanics, as long as you follow the lit path
 - World map allows for placing custom markers and tracking to appear on the compass on top of UI
 - Tree tops are safe base-building spots located all over the map and allow you to move your base wherever you're focusing on the map
 - Food, while needed to survive, is plentiful and straight forward

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - Map locations / markers are NOT sharable between co-op players
 - You will very likely have moments of side-pathing to get to where you want as there are many large elevation changes in the map that you can't traverse easily early on, which can be a pain if you're also in default combat
 - Tree Tops do not have dedicated markers on the map after discovery (only claimed ones are marked)
 - Player markers cannot be changed to indicate what the marker you left means or was for
 - some materials are stuck inside impossible-to-reach spaces (but this is a minor issue and only visible with vision mechanic)

[h2]~Crafting[/h2]
[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Plenty of inventory space
 - Plenty of materials to collect
 - Plenty of items to craft
 - Building is mostly intuitive, similar to Conan Exiles, and allows you to toggle snapping
 - You can build just about -anywhere-, and not just tree tops
 - Dismantling buildings and stations returns all materials (THANK YOU!!)
 - Ability at start highlights anything that drops materials, which is REALLY useful with how well plants and objects blend in

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - Building system has ""support"" mechanic that only tells you when placing a structure has not enough support (Would love support highlighting like in Valheim)
 - Armors can only be crafted at NPCs, making remembering what is needed for crafting and which npc crafts which armors a little annoying

[h2]~Combat[/h2]
[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Plenty of enemies to fight, especially for crafting materials
 - Combat is straight forward
 - Weapon variety and strengths/weaknesses forces you to adjust weapon usage

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - Enemy aggro range in non-passive mode is really wide, and many enemy types are too persistent, especially in early game play
 - Game allows for a ""passive"" mode to disable the aggro range entirely until you attack, which is nice, but then makes adventuring almost trivial

[h2]Things I'd like to see[/h2]
 - A combat balance change to address a middle-ground between the standard overly-aggressiveness of enemies and the ""passive"" mode. Maybe making ant type enemies less persistent if you aren't attacking or leave their designated area
 - Some improvements to the map markers, particularly with co-op
 - Better direction, especially early on, as to where to go for some materials, like flint (This was the one material I had to look up where to find to start)
 - compendium entries or anything to improve armor crafting info when not at npc",1680249253,1680249253,True,0,0,0.496845424175262451,0,True,False,True

2. Runs smoothly
3.Keep's you entertained 
4. Small details in the game you see if you look are super fun.
5. The tames are fun
6. The building and how the bases work are amazing!
I would give it a 8/10 for a early access release.
Con's
1. Combat seems a bit janky but still fun ( a little work it would be amazing)
2. Tames need to more uses and more health and better camera movements.
3. Gardens
4. The storms and the season's seem a bit out of sorts.
5. Day/night cycle needs adjusted

EA, I might change my vote on it depending on what updates to the game they have in store down the road, that should be a no-brainer that I shouldn't have to say, but there's individuals who simply don't understand that negative feedback isn't just bashing on a thing for the funsies.

Price - get it on sale if you wanna follow the development of it yourself, that'd be my advice. I don't regret buying it, but it's definitely not currently worth the full price. They might raise the price after the full release,
I wouldn't be shocked if they do.
Durability - needs balancing, I simply don't care for how often you gotta fix your gear and armor, it's nonesense. The only reason I even bothered to get the crude axe is because the wooden one can't cut down all, and I dreaded fighting anything because the thought that I ""just fixed my stuff 1 minute ago"" popped in my mind every time I realized I needed something an insect drops.

Animal companions - it is very, very, so very lame that you can only have one tamed insect friend at a time.

Jumping - felt like I was jumping around on the damn moon. Don't like it, I avoid jumping as much as I can.

Great tree - had to venture to the top of it to claim it in order to make a base, I guess, but it turned into a jumping puzzle not even half way up and as someone with a phobia for heights, I just did not appriciate that with the moon-jumping added, so I went back down and noped out of that. Perhaps there is an easier way up that doesn't involve jumping, but if there is, my phobia just didn't allow me to look for it. 

Resources - an annoyance for the sake of being an annoyance disguised as ""making things more challenging.  Something most all games of this type is guilty of, scattering rescources all over the map so you're forced to go all over the map to get them. It's not a reason for the not-recommended, but it's an annoyance nonetheless. Biggest annoyance about it though, the constant F-clicking. 

Water and instant death - noise that doesn't add anything to the over all experience, in my opinion. Wasn't hard for me to avoid, but considering just how much goddamn water there is to treck around, it just became another annoyance. 

Combat - harharhar. No. Just no. No. I'm gonna be stuck playing on peaceful and I will only be dealing with that noise when I so absolutely cannot avoid it when it comes to resource gathering. But I will not, I so absolutely won't be attempting to kill that rhino beetle or whatever for the sake of the quest. Dodging, blocking and parrying needs more than just fixing before I will bother. No. Nope. All the nopes.

Building - is meh at best as it currently is. As a builder who loves making while cities, giant castles and large, complicated builds, I'm just not impressed with what's currently in the game. Building process is fine, I guess. Not so bad it's rage inducing, but not so good it's praise worthy either. Just meh and fine.

Bug designs are fantastic, but combat is dogwater. Either you hit and roll and hit and roll and hit and roll and hit and roll just to win a fight or just tank it and swing and hope for the best since you almost never fight any bug solo and they hit like a tank.

The idea of taming is pretty great. I love the fact that, unlike taming in most, there is an actual purpose and usefulness in taming, but they dip their toes in water and die. Their pathing is stupid considering when a bug is following you to attack you, they can traverse everything with impeccable speed, but your tame will randomly take a long way, run in to enemies and die instantly. They can be too much of a target too easily.

Why. In. The. Fuck are we missing two very important QoL implementations. At least let us tread water to cross and let us pull from chests for crafting. So. Fucking. Stupid to not have these. You will never be able to convince me that having to go to the chests to grab mats just to craft something is a good option for a game.

Not a fan of the armour system. I would much prefer if the locations of the npc's need to be found for us to get a schematic or something to learn to build the armour instead of having to go to them, find out what you need to make the armour, go get the mats, then run back to the npc to get the armour. There are a few things in the game that are too much of a chore and it feels like its just wasting your time.

Another QoL feature that I am personally not a fan of, but its not really a big deal is the fact that bugs only sometimes drop loot. I can understand if there are some rare items that have a percentage, but a grasshopper not dropping its leg? Not getting an ant head? Its unnecessarily annoying, but w/e. There are worse things that need to be addressed.

(EDIT): 

Forgot to mention a couple things. Not sure if I am alone on this or not, but the durability is kinda trash. You get in a fight or two and you are stuck running back to repair, carrying the mats at all times for a bench to repair, or just using up too much inventory to carry too many weapons to help manage it. It just drains way too fast.

Give us the ability to craft basic bandages while out in the world. Fiber is easy enough to get, but its also quite a valuable resource early on for almost everything, but having the ability to craft them only at a bench kinda sucks, which again, makes you pretty much have to carry mats for a bench at all times.

A small little thing I noticed was picking up stacks. If you have a full inventory and drop a full stack of, lets say 30 fiber, pick up 3 fiber, and go to pick up that full stack, it says you pick up all 30 fiber, but in fact you pick up none. You still only have the 3 stack in your inventory. I figured it was a bug that it said I picked up all 30 with full inv, but I also figured it would fill that 3 stack, which it does not. You end up just dropping the 3 just to do a swap. 

Overall, the game isn't bad, but there needs to be some changes and fixes before I can recommend it.",1680223374,1680239203,False,1,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,True

pros:
- game looks pretty good
- its been a pretty smooth game so far
- armor looks great and offers different benefits
- zero bug/glitches so far
- building is decent and you get 100% items back if you destroy it (im not a builder so square box for me) 
- you can tame bugs and a lizard!

 cons: 
- combat is clunky at best
- 95% of the bugs want to kill you with huge aggro range
- stamina usage is way too high dodging in combat is a must but uses 25% of stam to do so
- blocking is ok but stam usage is way too high
- there is a story just very little and basic. 
- quests are basic. hunt huge bug kill it and bring item to quest giver
- cant make armor at base need to gather all the items then take it to npc to make it
- only one tame at a time. to get another you have to release your current one to gat a different one
- as a a person with arachnophobia the arachnophobia slider doe NOT help it just removes the legs and makes them a spider torpedo.

i know there are more cons than pros but the game IS good for early access. it is a game for more than one player as solo play is very frustrating and very challenging. you have to be creative to make it solo. i do recommend this game as is because it is fun and i think the devs will continue to improve it as they go. i would recommend adding more to the story about how and why the ""giants"" are no longer around. beef up the stam bar and or lower stam usage for everything. increase the tame limit one is just not enough. make it to where once you complete the mission you can make the armor at base. balance the combat bugs have a huge hit range compaired to us.",1680238029,1680238837,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Can play it solo, with friends or open a public server but like Valheim your limited by about 10 players online at the max.

Looking forward to see who the developers keep building on to this game! Things I would love to see.

- Dungeons, give us more RPG ( mmo even ) vibes. Would love to have a few non craft able loot items found here and there for gear and such, especially when it comes to the armor variety. Would be ok to say find recipes like Conan, but also unique drop items that you can't craft would be excellent as well.

- Base Raids :  not sure if this is in the game yet to be honest I found a great tree like right away so my base is tucked up into the clouds.  But I feel some  7 days to die type base raids would be excellent for the future to give a reason to building the stronger bases?  Also gives more longevity to the game over all

1. the progression of this game is not balanced, you have to go past really difficult mobs to get flint when the mobs that you are having to get past pretty much require flint tools and weapons. In most survival games you start at spawn and thats where you will find everything you need till the next tire which is when you go further into the map, In this game everything is all mashed together and you could think you in a noob zone but then you get wrecked by a wasp right out of spawn,
2. the combat doesnt make any since, this stamina drain is way to insane for combat i dodge once and then i get hit twice by a mob before i can dodge again, also they way mobs attack is really dumb, most mobs have a charge up before they attack so you can time a dodge but they follow you so dodging is almost point less unless you go straight back everytime but then you can reach the mob so you get stuck in this loop of running away and then chasing the mob and can never really hit them properly and it just make for a frustrating time.

Everything else in this game i think is really awesome and I have enjoyed it all so far but as it stand right now the progression and the combat need a rework for this game to fun",1680230504,1680230504,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The bugs looks great, and the building is intuitive. So, there are elements I really like. I'll likely update this as the game changes and updates, but right now, I wish I'd waited to buy.

Frustrations: 
-Jumping is very clunky. Sometimes I seem to bounce off where I'm heading, and I fall and have to start the climb over. 
-When conversing with npcs, it's not intuitive to skip the dialogue to read at your own speed. I keep accidentally closing the window, which is frustrating when I'm mid-conversation and have to start all over again. 
-I am frustrated by harvesting materials and then having to pick them up afterward. Why don't they just go into my inventory?
-The materials needed for progression are very far away from the starting area, behind enemies I'm not strong enough to fight solo. To craft weapons strong enough to fight them, I need the items beyond where they are. I'm not the best combat player, but this feels asinine.
-Some aspects of the graphics feel really dated.",1680141174,1680229997,False,15,1,0.586156368255615234,1,True,False,True

It's a lot like Grounded but with a more realistic and less cartoonish art style. Actually the best description would be if you took Grounded and a late 2000's MMORPG and put them in a blender, then sprinkled in some dark souls difficulty.

Honestly for an early access game, it's downright incredible and ""WAY"" better than grounded was when it entered early access. It feels like a nearly finished game honestly. The gameplay is fun, the performance is pretty good, the bugs (of the technical variety) are relatively few, and the world is huge.

That being said, it does have issues. The bosses are broken in that they have broken A.I. and leashes so you can just run away from them till they reset then shoot them to death while they do nothing, their HP doesn't even reset when they do, so you can easily whittle them down till dead. Also progress loss does happen if the game crashes, or is forcibly closed. (I did not any crashes in 18 hours, but others with lower end PC hardware have reported crashes.) There are other minor bugs, but those are the two big ones.

Ratings for a game should be solely based on the core gameplay itself and not on features like ""Mod Support"" or ""Server Hosting"" being in the game at ""Early Access"" launch.

So far this game has been a blast. I have been challenged some by small AND VERY LARGE MENACING bugs chasing me through the wilds when I'm running back to my gravestone and killed repeatedly trying to RUSH my way back to my corpse lol The weather and seasons systems are a lot of fun as well and the building is a lot of fun. The environment is nice to look at and immersive while also helping to create a sense of danger as you have a lot of areas where things can just come out of nowhere and you're surrounded by enemies.

I love how the game meshed together some of my favorite things about other survival games and added a little of their own spin. Totally worth the price in my opinion and I can't wait to see what they have planned for the future. Also... THANK YOU for having a dodge button that can be rebound lol

Pros : 
-The game is pretty. Some textures and designs don't hold too well when zooming in, but landscapes look amazing when gazing at the horizon, and night time with the few lights and fireflies looks good.
-The music and sounds : Great atmosphere. Music is a bit over the top for certain fights, but I like it.
-The building : It's nothing crazy or expansive like Valheim, but the building mechanics and items in this game are pretty decent. You get enough of a build kit to be creative and unique.
-The tree claiming system for your base is really cool.


Cons : 
-The combat system is clunky as hell. Animations have a delay and are slow, and you are locked in when you start one. Things like blocking and dodging become hard to time and annoying to fit between attack sequences. Aim and reach are inconsistent as well. With so many aggressive enemies attacking you the moment you leave the starting area, you'll often be fighting, and it is not fun.
-Armor and weapons : The game uses a very basic system of weakness'. Monsters all have 1 weak damage type, and are resistant to everything else. Your armors also fill specific tasks, like protecting you from the cold or more defense against a damage type. The result is that you will be carrying a diverse range of weapons and armors with you at all times, taking up most of your inventory space, and changing them constantly to answer your immediate need.
-Durability of tools and weapons : You'll be fixing stuff way too often.
-Creature taming : What was suppose to be a big selling point... Tamed creatures are weak, can not be buffed or modified, and die easily. You'll spend time getting resources to make a bait, work hard to tame the creature, then you'll lose that mount after a fight or two. Does not feel worth the effort.
-Storms can kill you. They arrive out nowhere, don't give you that much of a head's up. I could understand being debuffed and penalised when walking into a storm, but a death storm with only a 10 second warning on such a big map is bonkers. I'm suppose to just sit here for 2-3min?


Final opinion : 
-The game might get good, but it isn't right now.
-Creature strategy needs to be addressed : The ""1 weakness, all else bad"" approach to creatures makes strategy overly simple and leaves little room for a player's originality when prepping for combat.
-I would welcome RPG elements to character progression. The game relies too heavily on progression through gear, which is grindy, punishing (losing everything when dying), and leaves little room for diversity in fighting styles and loadouts when playing with friends. You are all gonna wear the same armor and swing the same weapon that has advantage against the creature you targeted.
-Something needs to be done about the mess that is armor/weapon/inventory management in here.
-The taming system needs to be reviewed to add value for the player.",1680191979,1680205451,False,15,0,0.557840228080749512,0,True,False,True

There is no grave/corpse for you to run back to and that itself is very disappointing. Even if it was just a portion of your stuff that was able to be collectible after death that would be a major improvement, but having everything gone within a matter of seconds really hurts the desire to play after losing an hour+ of progress.

The Stamina system awful and the companion system bad pets get in the way or bug out and die with no marker so u lose all the items u stash with them losing every thing.

The game really hard to navigate and the weather system gets annoying the combat really bad and its very easy in this game to get ambushed by alot of enamys.
Blocking and dodging useless cause it uses stamina along with attacks so you are always struggling with the stupid stamina system and 3 strikes attacks and your out of stamina and left circaling enamy trying to wait for it to recovery constantly thats how fights go its not fun.

Bows are bad waste of resources and takes forever to draw them to fire where there effective enamy will be all over u before u have a chance to fire a 2nd arrow and the stamina and movement speed penality with the bow makes them near useless only to use them to aggro enamy to then switch to melee thats only usefulness bows have.

My friends and i constantly struggled with the combat in a way it felt not fun at all i only died once so far playing due to a hoarde of enamys spawn all around me at night like 9 bugs died instantl.

Again the Stamina system needs to be removed for combat it dosnt add to the game it hurts it and make combat too stressful and not fun and too hard to manage making certin feature useless like blocking and dodging cause u want to preserve that stamina for attacks Combat too stressful to be fun where you rather avoid it then engade with it cause how bad it is.

Also the game has like a system where u have to carrie a verity of weapons cause some enamy have weakness to other witch this system should ne removed its annoying to have to have to carrie so many items and micromanage them on top the stamina system and keep cycling diffrent weapon types along with tool types and repair hammer and torches its not fun.
Weapons should be more player choise and play style not forced to use every thing cause some enamy are greatly weakren by certin weapon types.

Game is way to stressful constantly that there is no fun envolved with it.

I have read a lot of the negative complaints and most of them are user error or they probably just have a bad computer. The only things that are currently annoying/frustrating are: Not being able to swim and instantly dying in water. Not being able to jump onto leaves or other structures like in grounded. And, no dedicated servers yet (supposed to release with 1.0). Beyond that me and my friend had a blast playing all day yesterday. Durability is fine, I was able to fight 30-40 monsters before a repair, and if you repair early enough it costs 0 materials. Jumping MAY be a bit clunky, but once you get used to it it seems fine to me. One thing I wish this game had, which maybe it will eventually, is a progression system like Valheim where you level up skills by using them. Stamina, weapons, jumping, swimming, and whatever else.

Been playing this game since launch. 14 hours isn't really long enough to make a good review but here's my attempt at suggestions for new players: 

1. This game doesn't hold back, so gear up quickly. 
2. The fighting mechanism isn't refined well. Aggro is really aggressive. Isolate and destroy your target. Groups of 3 or more enemies are hard to do by yourself. Bows are not that effective against flying enemies unless you're close range.
3. Don't expect quick progression. The hazards of daily life on this game are enough to make you scream. 
4. Peaceful mode negates nearly all the listed problems above but still keeps the survival aspect of the game. Don't feel bad for using it.

Added:..i will keep it as a positive for now as im still enjoying it, But the combat system is kind of broken and needs tweaking, Blocking seems pointless and dodging things on some fights is just a no go it wont work and even when it does work there is not enough time to get back to the mob to swing and attack before it attacks you again... stamina needs buffing abit as i state if you want to dodge shit you need to do it very often and even after you dodge and manage to squeeze an attack in and you want to keep on attacking that's it your done for, 1 dodge 2 attacks and your stam has gone. The durability of weapons and tools is silly, it should not drain down that quick, yes i thought for wood and basic tools fair enough but you upgrade to flint and its still just as quick. you cant even go on a far adventure and your tools/weapons last long enough without a repair... apart from these things the game is good, but im yet to defeat the first boss as i can dodge its attacks and it can 2/3 shot you.

Definitely a great game to play with friends or your significant other. The game scratches the same itch as valheim does but strangely it scratches the itch more effectively. The visuals are stunning. 
Gameplay itself is a little rough around the edges, storms need to be less severe when not in winter, the issue of having to have your inventory slammed full of items to be prepared for certain types of hostiles should also be remedied: Larger inventory, or more versatile weaponry need to be made available or perhaps even a tool belt that allows for you to carry all your weapons and tools separate from the main inventory.
Mounts are pretty cool and definitely an improvement over other games of this genre (looking at you grounded) though I feel like it will be even better later down the road. 
The armor system is kinda of non-optimal, having to cross the map isn't inherently difficult but it is inconvenient having to trek across the whole map just to get a set of armor crafted, and its especially difficult during the long winter where travel outside is only possible (to my knowledge) in one set of armor without freezing to death. 

I know my review has been a little critical but I absolutely do recommend the game. It has a charm seldom found in games these days and I found it captivating. The world is stunning and inviting. This game is definitely a breath of fresh air with its own unique twist on the survival craft genre and is certainly worth the price even on day 2 of early access. 


TLDR: Worth the money if you enjoy survival crafting, especially worth a buy if you enjoyed Valheim as this has similar build mechanics without the terrible stamina system. A few rough edges but even as is its worth the purchase, and has the potential to buff out into a fine gem to add to your collection, extremely fun with friends.",1680159001,1680160462,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Looking forward to more updates for sure! I do have some constructive criticism for the Developers and no doubt they will iron some this out as it's in early access :

 1)(My smaller gripe) Storms are great, but sometimes they are back to back. I came down my tree and I had to go back up because of storm. I waited out the storm and went back down the tree and then another storm had started. 

2)(My biggest gripe) The taming feels a little anti climatic. You attack the creature a couple times and then hit ""F"" to tame (if you have the required food item). And then that is it. I think they could take a page out of Wild Card's book, the way Ark has you tame creatures. I think making us work a bit more for the tame or even a taming bar, and then also the tames die pretty easily at least the early tames that you can get. I can't put in exact words what it is that is bothering me with the taming, maybe I've been to spoiled with Arks taming. The tames don't truly feel like a companion and you can't even change there name. Having one tame at a time is kinda disappointing also. I know this is early access so please don't feel like I'm picking on the game. I know a lot can change at any point.

Blocking is useless, Dodging doesn't give I-frames and uses more stamina than hitting. Hits are inconsistent as well, sometimes your weapon will just wiff through the enemy. The compass isn't used for anything other than custom waypoints, and the map resets to a default position every time you close it. When you die, you spawn with the last tool you had equipt, be that an axe, torch, or food even, not your weapon. Which makes getting your stuff back nigh of impossible in some scenarios. I understand the want to have a harder ""grounded-like"" game, but when there are more enemies, all of them move in packs, and all of them can kill you in a few hits by themselves, it doesn't end up being fun. Not to mention graves spawning in the water, enemies having no collision with your base and still being able to hurt it, and health regen, both with food and bandages being so weak its a waste of time, its not, in my personal opinion, worth buying.

The questing system is just weird.  If I did not see the new people on the map I would never know where to go.   It is half baked at this time and I can see already that they well eventually redo many systems in the game. The map is made solely to make you have to run around a lot early game.  So far there is no really open areas, its all twisty and closed in.  The map is small'ish for people expecting something big.  I find I can never have enough fiber since it is used in almost everything you make early game and while there are many nodes, its just not enough.  The early game is lack luster and there was absolutely nothing that ""hooked"" me.  There might be some cool things later on but there needs to be something in the beginning to make you really go WOW.  It is just not ready for prime time and that is going to take a lot of work before that happens.  I buy this stuff because I want to support anyone putting a solid survival game out there.  I can't have enough of them.  I cannot say the base game is terribly solid game play wise (as in the mechanics within the game).  Its just not that intuitive.  I had zero issues with any form of software bugs with the game.  Running a Radeon RX6600XT and everything had to be set to low to get reasonable frames out of it.  Anything not on low settings and it turns into a slide show when looting stuff.  Get used to hitting the F key a lot too.  Auto pickup would not be the worst thing to implement in this game since you are just chasing materials that are sliding down hills and what not when gathering mats and I usually enjoy that aspect of survival games.  Not here.  Should have launched with persistent server support but I read that its coming in 1.0 release.  I suspect no less than two years for that.  You can tell its a young dev team when you utilize the in game systems but they will streamline that I am sure.  I cannot for the life of me not understand how these dev teams ignore all the things from the successful survival games and try to reinvent the wheel on some basic systems.  
TLDR; The game is MEH.  Give it four to five years.  Might be pretty good by then.    I cannot even say that chopping trees and gathering mats has that fun factor because I actually enjoy that aspect in other survival games. Graphically, its a solid OK.  Char control, nothing to write home about but it works well enough.  Combat, never was a huge fan of fight and roll and this is that.  No persistent servers for some time IF they wait till 1.0.  On the survival game scale its about a 4.5/10 in its current state.

I may or may not update this review in the future.

So far this game is fun, and very clearly a (well done) early access title. There is a fair amount of content and much to do, though balance, while initially seeming okay, feels a bit lumpy. One minute things feel too easy, another minute things feel too hard. Yet another minute feels somewhere in the middle.

For some reasons, the game gives me vibes of Gothic 3 (in a really good way). Controls are good but lack a bit of polish. Graphics are great, I like the more ""realistic"" vibe they have compared to Grounded which is a lot more saturated and cartoony.

Base building is simple but gets the job done. Don't expect to be building castles like in Conan Exiles for example but it is good enough.
Combat is ok. Very simple and I feel that the dodge is a bit useless. Enemies seems to ""auto-lock"" on you so it's hard to have the right timing (or many I'm just bad).

The fantasy elements of the games are good. They give you a main ""Quest"" at the start and then push you off the balcony, to a certain death.

Conceptually, this is a brilliant game. A survival crafting game with a very souls-like aspirations, and a general feel like early FFXIV. 

Generally, I recommend the game. That being said...

In terms of feedback for this being an early access game:
1. The lack of minimap is annoying.
2. The Antenae sensory mode unfriendly for a neurodivergent attention span. 
3. Crafting is annoying because you have to manually click for every creation. Either give us a hold option or let a number be set.
4. Incorporate a sorting option for inventory. (In general, larger inventories or stacks would be great.)
5. A lack of skill progression makes moving forward a little dry.
6. The map is made for 3D maneuvering, but the method for getting anything to give you verticle is devoid of mention so far. 
7. Would strongly encourage adding some kind of Bestiary to track what drops what and where you've found certain things. 
8. Game feels like it's meant to be played on controller. Trying to dodge while fighting is tricky.
9. The block function is VERY slow.

But for now if bugs feel overwhelming you can go peaceful at any time. Then they will only fight back if you attack them first.

You get a gravestone that holds you stuff when you die and you get to keep the item you're holding to do your death run back. This is less punishing than many survival games where you have nothing after death or where your stuff can fall all over and despawn. You can have many graves if you keep dying with stuff.

Exploration is rewarding and the environment very pretty. You can follow the quests by npcs or venture off into the unknown into the harder areas before you're ready. The game wont stop you but it's not the best action. You get better gear from npc quests. I love the different bioms so far.

I love that it has seasons and weather. You get enough warning for a bad storm to erect a shelter to wait it out or return home if you're close. There are different armors to deal with the cold and hopefully they'll be some heat mechanic later as well to deal with maybe in certain areas if not in summer specifically. Fires warm you just fine it just takes a bit of time. There are also warming foods you can take with you to keep exploring. Don't start a boss fight if the weather isn't great since bad storm might happen.

There's a decent amount of choices in character creation. Maybe they'll add more. It doesn't matter that much since you will be covered by armor most of the time.

My only real gripe is there being no pause in single player. This is an issue since every time you log out you then spawn back at your base and would then need to cross the map again to where ever you were. This is a very real issue for some of us who are prone to interruptions. I really hope single player pause gets added.

There's lots of different building sets, tools and armors. It's free to repair things as long as the durability is still green. The lower it goes the more it'll cost. The materials to make a bench to repair are cheap and easy so you can repair in the field but most of the time you'll be fine if you repair each night.

It's beautiful and part of that is because not all foliage has collision. This is fine. Mammals are denser than insects even small ones. That leaf you wish you could stand on likely wouldn't hold you any way. I think this is far better than the plastic blades of grass in Grounded. I like a game that looks nice. And since I've seen some confused, the small ""grass"" all around is moss. It's even got those little spore things coming out of it.

I feel plenty small in this. You fell like something naturally small which you are. You are a natural creature out in nature not someone who was shrunk down surrounded by human things. I think it's done well and the scaling is very consistent.

The story is very basic. The npcs just help you progress and provide minimal lore. It's more focused on the survival aspects which is fine by me but they do plan more npcs so maybe more will get added. If you want a new sort of survival game this is a good one.

No there's no swimming but there's literally no reason to have it. There's no under water labs or anything of use. You'd just use it to cross the ""rivers"" which would lessen the game since you'd not need to parkour across or find that log bridge. Maybe they'll add a late game water skimming mount in the future but I don't see a need for early game swimming and it would actually lessen the experience.

It's good to have some difficulties traversing the map on foot. It makes a tame to help you travel more valuable and the environment more challenging in a realistic  manor. You have to parkour up to claim the first tree base. This game is meant for the environment to be challenging.

Tames need work but that's on the road map. They need more health or armor or something but it's still fun to do. You just need to be careful with them. Use them for travel and keep them safe instead of for fighting. At least for now. You can only have 1 right now but they will add stables soon and then you can keep more. Right not the tame is tied to the character so spawns with the character into a world. So multiple would get awkward. The stable will allow tames to spawn with the base instead.

Over all a good survival experience that needs some polish which it will get. The developers have been great in working with the community to get the game they want.

Pros:
-Seems to have a good amount of content already even though it's still in early access.
-Boss fights are fun so far.
-The game is actually challening so far.
-Good graphics for an indie title at this price, the lighting effects are a particular standout.
-You need to continually build and maintain your bases so if you like building stuff thats fun. Terrain management and where you build is important.
-Co-op is a lot of fun but not required, you can play solo. (it might even be easier, not sure yet)
-They have a roadmap published right here on the page so you know what to expect during this early access period.
-Music/ambiance is very good.
Cons:
-Early access title which means it's not fully optimized and is quite demanding(see minimum requirements). I tried the game on my laptop and it runs OK on my laptop with a GTX 1650ti on low settings, 1080p but your results may vary.

There's no middle ground between peaceful and online mode, in online mode everything is pretty much aggressive.

        2.  combat and movement are pretty decent could be tweaked a bit .

cons-1. character models are a little stagnant in the face making them
          feel a bit soulless  .
         2. the day and night cycles felt fast and with bugs being aggressive at night

My game is running with no issues other than the typical frame drop when you enter an open world because of the loading that has to be done. I feel like a lot of people jump into games like these with a potato and cry when they can't run the game on the highest settings.

AMD 5900x

Do some work and actually play with the settings. I will say it doesn't help the game auto sets the graphics to Maximum. So make sure you change it accordingly.

The stress of being low on the food chain and mostly frail stepping foot into the world is fun so far. Ambiance is on point as well.

It's another survival game i love those
It runs good enough
Pretty easy to pick up and to understand
