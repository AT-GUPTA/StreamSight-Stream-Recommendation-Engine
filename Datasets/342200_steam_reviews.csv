There are C-Bills and Mech Credits, the former being a general in game currency and the other a premium. However, during event periods and even just from in game achievements, you will gather both. Most purchases are interchangeable. Mech Credits are particularly used for superficial cosmetics or hero mechs. 

Holiday or specific launch events will garner free mechs, cosmetics, and currency... And those happen frequently. 

There are purchasable mechs that are considered hero mechs IE have unique quirks, color schemes and hardpoints, but most non mech credit purchasable mechs are still considered ""meta"" or viable. You do not see over rampant use of hero mechs in games at any tier, truthfully. 

Learn the tank controls, get into the lore, and try the game. 

It's still enjoyable, don't let the extreme turbo nerds try and deter you... Oftentimes they find little joy in anything and have hyperfixations on certain hobbies and get way to nitty gritty on the minutiae

All I can remember is the constant hype and crushing disappointment that seems to plague this game from the beta till the current day. And oh yea the multi month crazy balancing cycle that they take extreme changes to the gameplay changing stuff for God only knows what cow sense they use.

Taking weeks to months more to fix balances the broke in the new patch, which they then freak up again in a new extreme balancing pass that break old stuff or introduce new crap which they then take forever again to fix ...

Oh, not to mention that they NEVER have been able to deliver what they promise on time or meet expectations that they hype people up to have. Years of delays and delays and broken promises and more broken promises and more hype, etc.

This game have taken forever to get where it is. And it is true that it is better then at the start. But the road is filled with too many side steps, too many broken promises, too many bad balance cycles. And they took so so so so long, to get where they are which is not even close to what they promise across the years. 

And after so many years, it is bascially the same game with a bit more variety. Look at PoE, look at Elder Scrolls, Dreadnought, World of Tanks, etc. Across the years they become way more then their start. But MWO is still just an improved deathmatch game in which all the different mods are just thinny coatings to the deathmatch. After so many years you would expect way way more.

To conclude, it is just now worth it to play the game. Because sooner or later, they will freak with you and you will slowly and slowly die inside by death of a thousand cuts.

I have play 600+ hours across the many years and have spend hundreds of dollars and I can no longer take the spiral that is MWO.

Trashy hit scanning (Damaging front of mech from behind and Vis Versa) not even close. Biggest issue and still current. Side look out your cockpit and watch things miss you and still do damage.

The ignored key presses, or GUI button clicks is the worst. It's like it just didnt ""go through"". Second biggest issue and still current. (when it's your coolant ignored and you blow up, fun)

Sounds bug out switching to maximum volume when they do.

Powerful teleportation, I see mechs jump jetting then fall three times through the air only to be rubberbanded back up into the air and fall again. Still current.

Lasers sometimes go through things. (Mountains, mechs, whatever.)
Lasers sometimes DONT go through things. (Empty spaces near any post, mountain, or building.) *A little bit fixed but still exists heavily in some areas*
(Looks like you can walk through a gap? NOPE your stuck grats!)

Very often just how twisted your upper body is will not be server side. So players still damage vital exposed parts even though on your screen they are hidden. *all the time now*

Microstutters from poor server performance/communication makes full damage lasers impossible. 

Good con = full damage lasers, more spread out damage from accurate torso twisting
Bad con = be a superior player, memorize map spots, and be psychic.

Matchmaking takes a long time even with prefered tonnage.

Loading in to garage takes forever!

You think that would be a good thing right? Well it depends on your taste of giant robots shootin the living crap out of eachother. 

[Game Feel]: The classics (Ie. Mechwarrior 2, mechwarrior 3, etc) all had computer opponents with stock loadouts for all mechs so as soon as you got say a Catapult on your radar, you know to stay at short range because of its LRMS. In MWO, every mech is most likely customized to diffrent loadouts, that and their all player opponents. So you take someone (like me) who has been battleing Stock mechs and bots for 3 years, and you put them against real people in customized mechs.  The result? One person who is dead within 20 seconds upon enemy contact. But who is also smarter about the game

[Customization]: The game has grinding aspects to it, but If you get good and do well, you can technically buy mechs pretty quickly and also have enough money after 2 or 3 games to customize a bit. The Customization system is also revamped in what I belive to be a good way. It has the Hardpoint system that gave Mechs meaning and pourpus from Mech 4. Along with the Critical system from Mech 2/3 and classic battletech. Meaning you can cram heatsinks and ammo into any place, but weapons specifically can only go in so many places. I find this system to be beautiful.

[Quirks]: MWO has some probloms with it, which is understandable given its nature. One of the most glaring issues is the nerfing of Autocannons. In past games AC's dished out lots of consistent damage and depending on type also had long range for largely no heat. They were balanced by their weight, ammo cosumption, and size. But MWO changed it with Ghost heat by making the ACs boil your mech within the first 3 salvos of AC/5 Rounds. Ghost Heat is also another issue so allow me to explain.
Take 1 laser, generates 10 heat.
take 3 lasers, generates 30 heat
take 4 lasers, should generate 40 heat right? Wrong, in MW0 it generates anywhere from 40-60 heat. That my freind is Ghost heat in a nutshell, the idea is to discourage the boating of say only medium lasers or autocannons. This is backfired by the design of some mechs however and is overkill. Take one of the SwayBacks with 6 Med. Lasers in its right torso in replacement of a Hunchbacks normal AC/20. You cant use that Swayback because of Ghost heat as in one volley you will overheat yourself and shutdown.

Recomendation?
This game has grown on me, and now I actually can recomend it, with a fair warning, it is not  like any other Mechwarrior games, but it is fun mainly cause of the community. The Community is amazing, they are supportive, game focused, and generally nice guys, I've also heard stories that even on Australian Servers the people are the same just with some Australian flavor and shenanagins, but don't qoute me on that cause I don't know for sure.

So In summary, if you like MMO games, and giant mechs, MWO is probobly the choice for you, if your a Die hard Mech fan, then be warned about the changes and way the game plays.",1487820574,1553658533,True,0,0,0.496414810419082642,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Lots of customization
- Pretty to look at
- The devs constantly give free stuff away by way of in-game events (currency, parts and entire mechs)
- Can obtain everything by being completely free to play (""buy to play"" mechs are only available in such a capacity for a limited time before their purchasable through the in-game currency)

Cons:
- No tank tracks for legs like the Armored Core games (used to be my personal favorite)

If you like stompy mech vs mech combat, get this game. If you like customising things to fit your own playstyle, get this game.

If you like fast battles where you can just jump in and play, don't get this game. If you are a die-hard fan of the Battletech Universe and think the best Mechwarrior title is MW:2 or MW:4 Mercs, then you probably don't want to play this game. 

While still being loyal to its predecesors, the gameplay is vastly different. If you wan't to try something different from other free games out there, then do try this game. You don't have to have hundreds of hours put into the game to have a decent selection of mechs to play with.

The playerbase is a mixed bag. The tier system doesn't accurately describe the actual skill of the player. Rather, its more of an XP bar to fill. At all tiers, you will have leaders that try to help the teams by giving instructions and leading everyone to a position. It is always a good idea to listen to them. There will also be the whiners in all tiers that will blame the team for their own poor performance. You can always ingore them. Then there are the silent watchers in the match, they will rarely lead the team themselves yet they can still pull or follow the team from reacting to situations in match. These are rare in of themselves as they are confused with your normal player who doesn't talk in match. Then there are the Potatoes. They are similar to the whiners in that they will whine about the team whenever they don't do well. The difference? The whiners can actually be good players that are frustrated to easily and take bad matches out on their team. Potatoes on the other hand are so incompetent, despite all the handicaps they constantly take, they think they are the absolute best and no evidence to the contrary will change their minds. These will almost always be the ones in LRM/ERLL/ERPPC assaults sitting at the back of the team over 1km away from the closest enemy (visible) calling the rest of the team ""noobs"" and ""bad"" (especially if a light mech flanks around and is able to take them out, which they will because these Potatoes will not understand the tactics of fighitng a light in an assault). There are also the TryHards that only use the meta of the month and will yell at you if you are not also running that meta. Please for the love of whatever diety you believe or do not believe in ignore these people. These are the people responsable for unnessesary nerfs to things because they used them in such a way that they because abused.

The Balalance, while still being a bit of a mixed bag, is far better than it used to be. There is a lot better pairity between the techbases (Clan/IS) with the edition of the Civil War technology. There is still gaps between mechs of ""equivalency"" on a case to case basis, yet balance is an ongoing process with slight adjustments done monthly.

The meta is squarely in the ""Ugly"" because it is really one of the major problems with MWO. Its dificult to describe because of its nature. Begginer ""meta"" is usualy trow as many lrms in the direction of the enemy as possible in the direction of the enemy. Players who advance to ""top tier"" never dropping this mentality become the Potatoes, yet that is no longer the meta. BTW, they can do that because the tier system is just an XP bar. Higher tier meta is difficult to actually describe as it sounds similar to the beginier meta, yet it goes from LRMs to Gauss+PPC with Jump Jets for pinpoint damage at far ranges without the fear of return fire because by the time you fire you are already dropping back down into cover.

Pros: Amazing community. When events have been awkward, I've seen people trading deaths to let people complete hard objectives (such as the recent event requiring you to kill someone holding a fuel cell), or a game pausing entirely for a few minutes because someone typed in all chat that they had police at the door.

Many mechs to try out, and many builds within each mech to play.

Cons: Can take a while to build up, especially F2P. Mechs for real money are relatively expensive, though significantly less expensive than they used to be.

TL:DR - one of the best F2P games here. You get your own mech and are not forced to pay real money if you don't want to. You'll hate the constant long range guided missile sniping (or love it, if you'll be one of the people doing it).

Good and active community, maps, everything. Runs on CryEngine.
But above all... The mechs.

The game creates a very good sense of ownership. When you buy your first mech, it can remind you a bit of Star Citizen. Beautiful cockpits, detailed design. You have to carefully choose the loadout for whatever you plan to do, and you will most likely get it very wrong at first. And die a lot. When you get into it a bit, it'll get more fun. See that giant assault mech? Grab a ligt mech, run around it and just shoot it legs off to kill it. Or walk into the wrong corner of the map and get caught in the cross-fire of 8 enemy mechs.

Stragety first. Fighting second. You'll probably like your mech a lot and won't rush into sensless battles. You go alone, you die. You go with your group, you won't die as quickly.

What costs actual money: Color customizations, special mechs (which generate more XP and in-game currency, meaning they ain't worth it) and other useless stuff. It's better to just look at the pretty red and blue mechs of other paying players ;).

As for optimization,  I've seen some complaints here. I mean okay, it's not perfect, but it runs smoothly without crashes on a i3 6157u with Iris 550 on mid-to-high settings. Just turn off the shadow effects and you're fine.",1487337352,1491910651,True,11,1,0.517893373966217041,0,True,False,False

--Cons
For FUCKS SAKE getting into a game takes WAY TO FUCKING LONG.  Holy Cthuhulu i dont understand why you need 3 steps to get into a game.... i mean COME ON.  click join, wait 5 min... select gametype... wait some more.... get into ""ready"" screen wait 80 seconds more cause nobody can click ready.  Its to long.... i dont understand how you havent figured that out yet. ITS AN ARCADE GAME!  Most matches are done in under 10 minutes... then you have to spend 5-10 more minutes JUST GETTING INTO ANOTHER MATCH.

Terrain is about as shitty as it gets.  No joke... its really underwhelming... rolling hills and shit... for 1 mile 

Maps are too small.  WAY to small.... Did i mention ""Arcade"" game?  ya... 24 odd mechs in a battle... nobody ""pushes"" the fight.  it basically... hide... shoot... hide... shoot.... hide.... shoot.... if the maps had ibjectives... and was larger... well it might be better.  hide... shoot.... hide.... go take a poop... come back... shoot.

Paywall for new players... this game.. it isnt skill.  its vets and credit card kids p2wing a bunch of clan mechs.  thats it, end of story... hide... shoot... hide... shoot... spend 100 bucks.... hide better... shoot harder.... The script kiddies will tell you ""skill"" but i've seen their mechs.  I've seen the elite tier upgrades, ive seen the extra modules, and the fact that the elites have all of them.  Hiding and shooting... isnt skill.

Quick Join matches are for REAL a Joke.  No rhyme or reason to the mechs they throw into the mix... its just... whatever... 10 minutes of hiding around corners... 1 team just dominates the other team... you cant either play back, or play forward.  If you play forward... YOU WILL DIE... no if and or buts about it.  you wanna go marching up, you're toast... and then you get to WATCH THE TEAM for the rest of the match.  THATS RIGHT... you cant leave the match and get points... you have to SIT THERE AND WATCH THE GAME....

WTF IS FACTION PLAY?  you know how long it took me to get into 5 games of faction play?  2 hours.  2 FUCKING HOURS FOR 20 GOD DAMN MINUTES OF PLAY.... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?

--PRO

The customizations stuff is really cool



This game is like 10 years to late to the party.  they are dumping Xbox 360 matchmaking mechanics on games that last 10 minutes, MAYBE 20 if you are in Faction play... its basically just a fuck load of sitting around... wishing you had played the last game differently.  LOADS of regret.... LOADS....


EDIT:

Overall problem with the game

Gameplay dynamics are short sighted and unoriginal.

its a pc game based on a tabletop game, but most of the older renditions of this game have vastly superior mechanics.  Here are a few glaringly obvious problems that can easily be fixed.

1. Match mechanics suck.  Guard the VIP? most people dont even bother they just go for the kills, in fact that's usually the tactic of all of the match types on Quick and Faction.  Get kills, win match.  Why is this a problem?  Well it's actually really easy.  1 life matches mean people are either aggressive or passive (passive usually end up being ""snipah's"")  If every match you play earns you CB or XP based ENTIRELY off of kills and damage done... chasing down objectives in light mechs is sorta boring.  You can earn as much or more CB from losing and doing high DPS and getting kills than winning in a light doing objectives.  There is NO incentive to do otherwise for most players.  

2. One match / One life quickplay.  Again... quickplay matches are where fun goes to die.  Why?  because you either have a team that works together, has the right mechs for the map (snow maps with a NARC light and a few LRM boats... its horrible to be on the receiving end of that), and the right mechs for the team.  Imagine having 3 Direwolves on your team, and they have 3 Pirates Banes.  Most pugs simply leave the Direwhales in the rear, and ""usually"" every match has some slow Assault mech getting his ass chewed up by a pack of zippy lights.  Direwolves arms shoot very low, which means that if you have a team of mechs with only a few Pokers or pop tarts, it means that your heavies have to put their entire torso and core into view to fire back.  Trades become lopsided and when the ""battle"" ensues your bruisers are far more abused then theirs are.   With only 1 life, you have only 1 chance to have a good game or a bad game.  Once you die, thats it you have to sit there and watch your team.  The end usually ALWAYS has 1 team chasing down the other teams last light mech around the map.  

3. Objectives are the ""last ditch effort"" to win the game.  Sorry but this is why your gameplay mechanics suck so much balls.  If the teams ONLY care about the objectives as a second thought, you failed.  I mean consider this.  IF you have an assault match, 2 flags... you can either attack or defend.  Imagine which of these outcomes is ""mostly"" successful?  Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.  I have had MULTIPLE matches where both teams sat back hoping the other team would attack.... for 8 minutes or more.  Sitting around doing a little trading.  Its fucking boring.  You dont care about the objective, you just care about the outcome of whatever the team is doing.

4. Mechs Meta's are fucking lopsided as hell.  This is really the most trivilized part of the game.  Its trivial to PIR, and it shouldnt be.  The table top game, yes i played it, isnt anything to write home about.  It's like playing Dark Elves vs Khorne knights in Warhammer... One side can field anything, the other side has to field the perfect army or get wrekd.  Ditch the damn tabletop shit and focus on mech mechanics.  Clan omni mechs have huge customization capabilities, and even if you dont ""master"" a mech, you can get a fairly desirable outcome with builds.  IS mechs are locked into Meta builds.  Heat, tonnage, DPS, Engines and speed are customizable, SURE... but you don't see XL Assaults with massive loadouts stunting DHS and FF... its just not possible.  You trade... speed/DPS/defense.  XL Engines for IS are... well... almost suicide.  You do it for speed and firepower.  which means that the mech better HAVE the hardpoints and speed to make that concept work or its a fucking death sentence.  This is what I have the MOST problem with.  ITS THE CRYENGINE... look at what games like Star Citizen and other ""mechanized"" game play mechanics are doing with their game tech.  This game is seriously lacking in the area of ""breaking the mold"" for 50% or more of the mechs available.  What do you do with a MX90?  DAKKA.  What do you do with a Timberwolf?

I believe that if you were looking for a giant robot simulator with competitive gameplay, this would be one that most closely feels like you are piloting a mech. There are some other games out there in this genre but they each bring something different to the table. I will really only talk about this one and I'll try keep it concise as possible. 

PROGRESSION:
 Mechwarrior Online provides you an entry into battle and allows you to earn in game credits in order to purchase new 'Mechs, or new Variants of the same mech. The current system at time of writing has 3 different tiers of Skill levels that you can unlock Passive bonuses to that 'Mech chassis. When you have unlocked all Tier 1 skills on 3 Variants of the same 'Mech, you unlock an Elite section of further bonuses. Unlocking all of those Elite bonuses on all 3 mechs will unlock an additional Module slot which allows you to add extra passive bonuses that can be earned, bought, or discovered from Supply Crates that are won during playing. The better you play, the more XP and Currency you earn. This enables you to unlock Module passives through the Pilot skill trees, as well as purchasing new weapons, new 'Mechs, and new Modules to equip. There are also several rotating ""Trial"" 'Mechs that you can pilot to get a feel for, but are unable to modify them in the Mechlab until you purchase one.

MOVEMENT:
The controls are not twitch based, though it is not slow, and depending on the size and weight of your 'Mech it will control much differently. Light 'Mechs are often lightly armored and speedy, built for scouting the front lines and providing target locks to the back line, and Assault 'Mechs are the heaviest, slowest, and largest with the most possible armor and weapon capacities. In between are Medium and Heavy respectively. Each has their own strengths, weaknesses, styles, and there are an incredible number of 'Mechs to choose from. You pilot the 'Mech like a tank where the top half can pivot and look around while you control the legs separately. This is all easily done with the WASD keys and a mouse, or you can play with the keyboard just like the old games.

WEAPONS:
 'Mechs come with specific hardpoints which limits the types of weapons and such that they can carry. These range from Ballistic to Missile to Energy weapons. You could have Variants of one 'Mech that offer different configurations and #'s of each of these or all one type. This allows different styles of gameplay while still using your favorite 'Mech. Missiles require a lock on target either by your own line of site, or another teammate ""Locking On"" for you. As long as a teammate has them targeted and visible, you and your team should be able to fire Long Range Missiles (LRM's) from the back line to whittle them down before engaging. Short Range Missiles will launch at much closer range, but do not require distance to become ""Armed"". Long Range Missiles will do little to no damage at close range in most situations.  Energy weapons consist of Lasers of Small, Medium, and Large variety. Within them are regular and Pulse as well as special Extended Range versions. Each of them has different damage, heat production, and cooldown time allowing for different playstyles. Ballistic weapons are often different types of cannons, or long range rifles. PPC's are a mix of Ballistic and Energy producing massive heat, but also high damage. 

SUMMARY: 
There is so much to talk about this game, but really if you want a giant robot fighting game with tons of customization, progression, teamwork, strategy, built in voice chat, and tons of fun please feel free to check it out! If you tell your team that you are just starting, they should give helpful pointers on how to stay alive, or which 'Mechs to shadow. At the very least, do what you can to support your Assault 'Mechs and make sure they can continue laying on damage to the enemy. 
There is also now a really great Tutorial and ""Academy"" missions you can access at anytime you think you need to brush up on Mechanics.

I also encourage you to visit the No Guts No Galaxy podcast who streams from Twitch, has tons of Youtube videos of all the various 'Mechs, and also has it's own Discord server where people talk and group up for sessions of 'Mech warfare. 
Visit them @ www.twitch.tv/ngngtv and all their other social media links are there.

Welcome!

So, you're a new player who just installed MechWarrior Online (MWO), and your wondering what your first step should be to get into the game and learn the ropes! Well, have no fear! This guide is designed to not only help you get started learning those ropes, but also to guide you as you develop your skills and progress deeper into MWO&rsquo;s gameplay.

To veteran pilots who read this, I ask that you bear in mind that this guide is written simplistically to give new players a bird's-eye-view of the game. As a result, some difficult concepts have been potentially oversimplified to introduce new players to them. Please refrain from picking those apart. However, if you see real errors, feel free to weigh in on this guide.

New players, as you grow you will realize that the simplified portions of this guide are not as simple as initially presented. This guide will give you a working knowledge to get you started, but it will ultimately be up to you to take your education further!

First things first! MWO has no story. It is not campaign or story driven, and lacks a single-player system. The game is completely multiplayer focused and success will depend heavily on how well you work together with your teammates. With the exception of one game mode (more on that later), MWO matches take place between two teams of 12 players each. While individual efforts can be enough to turn the tide of a battle, it is more often than not the team's overall performance which paves the way to victory. So, do your best not only to boost your score, but also to coordinate with your allies to win matches! Now, let&rsquo;s get started!


User Interface (UI):

Open the game and log into it. The first thing you should do, is familiarize yourself with the User Interface (UI) and then to open the Training Tutorial. Click the Spoiler below for a tutorial video on the Mechlab, the UI, and the Training Academy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyixGdq05S4

The Training Tutorial is not going to make you a champion MechWarrior, but it will teach you the basics of the game while also giving you your first bit of pocket change. Please note, that I do not recommend purchasing any BattleMechs until you have completed all 25 Cadet Bonuses. Once you have completed all Cadet Bonuses, you will have a tidy sum of money to use on purchasing a BattleMech. Make sure you try out each of the Trial Mechs so that you get a good feel for what each weight class is like, and then purchase a Mech that you favor. An important item to note, is that any XP you earn with a Trial Chassis will be retained, so it may be in your benefit to purchase one of the trial chassis you used to obtain your Cadet Bonuses to help you save time leveling your first Mech.

Be sure to research the BattleMech you want to purchase before buying it though. Not all Mechs are equal, and some perform very poorly. You do not want to lose all your hard-earned, one-time Cadet Bonus C-bills because you purchased a bad Mech.


Buying Your First Mech:

This next video will teach you how to purchase and outfit a Mech. Click the Spoiler for a video tutorial on purchasing and outfitting a Mech.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpwY_Dg80Kc&t=1s

Combat Types: The Mech I purchased and used in that video is an Inner Sphere (IS) Cicada. It is a Medium Mech that specializes in speed and skirmishing. It is not particularly tanky, nor does it pack a substantial amount of firepower. As I demonstrated in the video, it works best when used to harass the enemy team while using strike-and-fade tactics. Other Mechs, like the Atlas, are tanks that absorb large amounts of damage while also outputting their own high damage. Others still, like the Hunchback, are built to be brawlers and excel at close-range, hard-hitting infighting. Some Mechs can be snipers and others can be Long-Range Missile (LRM) boats, lobbing their ordinance at targets from afar while tucked away safely behind cover. You, as the new Mech purchaser, must decide which gameplay style you favor the most!

It is important to note, that some styles are better than others. LRMs, for example, work well in the lower skill brackets, but are ineffective the higher you climb through the skill levels (more on skill levels in a moment). Sniping and skirmishing remain effective regardless of the tier level in which you find yourself. It is to your benefit to find a robust combat style that will carry you upwards through the ranks while maintaining its effectiveness.

Faction Tech: One other thing to recall, is that there are two principal Factions in this game. You have the IS and the Clans. The IS specializes in close-range brawling and mid-range skirmishing with tanky Mechs, high pinpoint damage, and lower heat generation. The Clans focus on long-range combat with high damage output and quick speeds, and also perform very well in skirmishing. Each Faction has its own advantages and disadvantages. As a general rule of thumb, Clan Mechs are far costlier than IS Mechs while also being more fragile. They can output more damage though and at longer ranges, so they are popular with competitive players. Think of Clans as being your performance vehicles while the IS is your work truck. The hot rod will beat your truck in a street race, but the truck will outperform that hot rod off-road or while pulling a load. Neither is better than the other, but each serves its niche. It is up to you to determine which one you like best for that first Mech purchase.

There is one more important difference between the IS and Clans. IS Mechs are all fixed hardpoint Mechs with fully unlocked chassis. Clan Mechs have two types though. There are the IIC Mechs, which are like high-performance versions of IS Mechs, and there are OmniMechs, which are unique. OmniMechs have locked chassis which limits the amount of customization available. This was done to help balance the Clans and IS since OmniMechs have the unique, modular equipment system known as OmniPods. OmniPods contain weapon hardpoints, and can be swapped around between Mech variants of the same chassis. This means that you can recombine hardpoints to acquire a weapons setup you like the most.

Bear in mind, that you are not limited to one Faction. You can own Mechs from both! However, this takes time since you must grind out all those C-bills. You can always take a shortcut and spend real money to buy Mechs though. Just make sure, as I said previously, that you research the chassis before buying it.

Personally speaking, I recommend that new pilots use IS Mechs. They are easier to learn how to pilot and are much cheaper, enabling you to purchase more of the them on a shorter time basis than the Clans. I will go into detail in a moment on why that is important. For now, just keep in mind that the IS is cheaper and friendlier to new players.

Weight Classes: Now that we have discussed the IS versus Clans, let's look at weight classes. You have four classes from which to choose! These classes are, Medium, Heavy, and Assault.

Light Mechs focus on scouting, skirmisher, and brawling support. They are the fastest class of Mechs in the game, but also the most lightly armed and armored. A Light Mech cannot face down a heavier Mech in a head-to-head fight, but must instead focus on using its high speed and maneuverability to keep its enemy off balance.

Make sure you are going to PAY to play this game. The grinding requirement to be competitive is higher than it used to be. And there are more  recently realeased Hero mechs are stronger than ordinary mechs variants, which can only be aquired by MC (in-game currency, which is EXTREMELY hard to ""earn"" sufficient amount to buy a hero mech by just playing the game).

Also, it takes long time for you to grind enough to be competitive ( in term of equipments and upgrades), making Premium time a nearly essential item unless you play like 12 hours a day, on every day basis.

The gaming experience is not bad for a paid player though (except you got team with AFKs, disconnected farmers, or team killers.........), it is suggested that you should make up your mind wheter pay or not before investing huge amount of time in it, or you may be disappointed.

-Potential for awesome cooperation between players,

Cons:
-Inaccessable. Its so difficult to know some of the basics and meta unless you dig around the internet.
-There is a lot of grinding to do just to aquire fundamental features. Supposedly I can only enjoy the game after aquiring these time consuming features, but why would I bother if spending the time to get them is so booring and long.

[u][b]Pros [/b][/u]
* Free to play game

* The only multiplayer mech game out there for mech fans right now(?)

* The community generally seems pretty friendly & a lot of people use voice comms

* Different game modes depending on how seriously you want to take it

* A lot of customisation of mechs & their loadouts

* Battles can be intense & rewarding if you do well / work as a team

* A high skill cap

[u][b]Cons [/b][/u]
* Extremely sloooow paced game.  Want to play a quick casual with a friend?  Depending on the day & time you're playing (and if the Americans are awake yet) you could be in a queue for 3+ minutes. Then you need to wait for the loading screen to vote on the map & gameplay mode... Then you need to wait for another loading screen to go into a lobby with 24 other people who have inevitably gone off to make a cup of tea / finish the washing up / do the weekly shop while they wait to get into a game - and you have to wait for every single one of those 24 players to press ready or wait for the timer to run down...  Then you get another loading screen to watch essentially another loading screen where your mech is dropped onto the planet...  Then you get to walk across the map for 2 to 3 minutes in your mech (or wait for the other larger & slower mechs to move into position).  

All this for probably about 5 to 10 minutes of gameplay if you are lucky

* Not being able to access any other part of the game while searching for a game is frustrating, you are forced to sit looking at a searching message rather than being able to check out possible upgrades in the shop or mech loadouts etc

* The menu layouts, sub options etc are all extremely confusing & poorly laid out.  I realise that part of this is due to the sheer amount of options the game has, but I can't help but feel a lot of this is down to poor choice & design on the developers part as well

* And the real killer is the grind.  The game does a good job at the start of rewarding new players with a lot of in-game currency for completing certain achievements - this then allows them to purchase a mech or two and get a few of the upgrades for that ship.  Great!  
Now you'll want to start levelling the skills up for that mech, no no no, you need to purchase & level up another 2 slightly different variants of the same mech you've already purchased!  This inevitably means you'll need to spend a lot more of those precious space bucks & that you will also need to use another two of your very limited spaces garages to hold the ships (and guess what garage spaces cost space bucks).  You also then need to play the two weaker (or less interesting) variants of that ship to the same level as the one you are interested in to unlock the next skill trees, and then repeat the same process of grinding up more experience on all three mechs. 
You'll also want to upgrade that ship with better engine parts or modules - some more space bucks needed, which are now being earnt extremely slowly since you completed all the starting objectives.  Well you better dedicate your life to this game or be willing to spend some serious real-cash money if you want to play more than a couple of different variants of mechs, which bring me onto the next point

* The cost of the in-game purchases is ridiculous for what you actually get, they do put special deals on for certain mechs which change regularly, but wow, it really does seem expensive for what you get

[u][b]Conclusion [/b][/u]

This isn't a bad game, in fact it can be quite intense & enjoyable in the right company & when you finally get into a game and do well, but it's pretty clear after a while that the developers are trying to fleece people who enjopy it / are interested in Mech games & have no other real options.

I realise it is free to play, and I purchased a mech or two at the start of the game as I wanted to contribute towards the game that I was enjoying (as I have done for other F2P games such as League of Legends), but you could sink literally 1000s of pounds into this game, and I have a feeling that they prey on people who are willing to do this due to their personality traits & previosuly stated lack of options for Mech games elsewhere.",1486906473,1486906473,False,5,0,0.463921278715133667,0,True,False,False

Dying community is not assisting in any way and a very large number of individuals are toxic and will moe lances around just to mess with people.
Grind is okay in my opinion, but it's understandable how so many people would be irate at earning only 200k (If you win and do well, otherwise expect only 50k in earnings) when a light mech requires 6 mil in cbills.
With ghost heat, there are OPTIMUM build in this game. Go either Gauss Rifles, or an ERPPC supported by lasers. For lights: Take an SRM boat or a mech with jumpjets and the ability to mount an ERPPC to poptart with. No other way to play the game and be effective.
Horribly balanced as a result of ghost heat and that DOUBLE heatsinks only provide a piddly 15% increase in heat dispersal, and guaranteed to only get worse with the suggested 'energy drain' mechanic.
No map differentiation. Every map is either an open plain or an open plain with mountains occasionally in the way. Even the 'urban' maps are still an open river with cover on either side or a mountain with no real cover at all. There are no maps built towards brawling, being in close confines, and no map statistic variation such as E/MAG blanketing from tabletop (Which stops your radar from working properly), hints that close range combat with non-light mechs is a  pipe dream.
Developer: Stop adding mechanics and just give us tabletop battlemech construction rules. Give us better and more complicated maps. Give us the option and ability to play more than one type of mech.

It is at its core, an arena shooter. For a battle tech game, time to kill seems a bit quick. But it is still much slower than an average FPS. Some matches can be an absolute joy while others can be the exact opposite.

Especially because new mechs and big weapons takes ridicules long to farm (200k cbills pr win, 10-17mil for the largest, most powerfull mechs. Thats around 100 games a 30 min for 1 big mech...

It's not an easy shooter.  It takes effort to get good (knowing the meta, learning different chasis and their weaknesses, positioning and targeting with different weapon systems, etc...).  One must also learn that working with ones team is vital.  Even the best players are easily taken down when isolated from their mates.  MWO is also about strategy: which mech you bring, how you build it, when & how you engage, which weapons you fire, etc...

This game is already a first class shooter; It sets the standard for stompy robot shooter games.  It has a rich lore in the Battletech universe.  But, it has potential to be much better.

However, it falls short in the meta game...the game really offers nothing beyond shooting opponents in different styles of mechs.  The community warfare mode needs a lot of work.  The war between the Inner Sphere and the Clans fails to engage.  Even to the extent that teams can make a minor impact, the fruit of these efforts are largely meaningless.  Individuals fail to reap any tangible impact from their efforts.  That combined with battles that are often one-sided as skilled teams drop against randomly grouped pugs...and the mode can quickly become discouraging...even for a top tier player.

A satisfying MechWarrior experience that takes as much teamwork and discipline as it does skill to best your opponent. This is a chess like tactical shooter that requires you to purchase and setup a mech to fit your play style, and then challenges you to master that play style. Mics are required as much as a mouse is, and you aren't going to get very far without one.

If you are looking for a game to get your MechWarrior fix in with then this will do the trick. 

This game has enough stragety and skill based elements in it to balance out the ""pay to win"" aspects of an ""online version"" of a game. That being said, this game could be light years better if it weren't for the pay to win mechanic that does exist. If you take this game seriously in any way you are going to want to purchase a few mechs which will end up costing you about the same price that they could charge if they made you pay to play the game in the first place. It only feels like a pay to win game in the mech lab mode, as there aren't alot of over powered things that you can add to your setup, as long as your team plays with good fundamentals.

Each match, outside of faction play, consists of a 12 versus 12 setup with a max time format, having a kill limit or score limit end the game early. You get 1 life and no health regeneration. There are 4 game modes consisting of Skirmish, Domination, Assualt, and Conquest. Assault being a VIP escort mode, Domination is king of the hill, and Conquest is like territories from halo 2. And yes If you own at territories you are still a noob.

There is a leveling system in this game and I will explain it the best I can in a flow chart style, with a little humor.

-play pick up games with trial mechs.
-grind for money to buy a mech that you might like
-realize that you hate the mech you bought and scrap it for a different one
-grind
-in the meantime, learn how weapon systems work and how different builds have different roles on the field
-realize its going to take months to grind to have the mechs that you want
-pay money for the mechs so you dont waste your time
-realize that you didn't understand the mechanics and re-buy the mech that you scrapped earlier
-level up a few different mechs to mastery efficiency via grinding in pugs
-grind to load said mechs with mods
-build a drop deck for faction play
-group up and que with other players that you like playing with
-play faction mode, shoot face, reck the enemy, and conquer planets.

If I won the lottery there would be a much better MechWarrior game and possibly a movie in production, but for now, as Mechwarrior fans, are just going to have to settle for this.

When I first heard of it I thought it would be terrible, and only gave it a shot because there was nothing else quite like and, well, it's free. And I'm very glad I did that.

The gameplay is really good, with a lot of depth and customization. It features hundreds of different 'Mechs variants that can be customised: loadouts, cockpit items and camo patterns. 
Some 'Mechs and weapons are inferior to others, but overall the game is pretty well balanced.

As for the F2P aspects, there are C-Bills, the common currency earned in every match, and MC, the premium currency. The best things that MC can buy are premium time, that increases C-Bills and experience earned in every match, 'Mech bays, that increased the maximum number of owned 'Mechs, and Hero 'Mechs, unique variants with a 30% C-Bill bonus.
The Hero 'Mechs are not overpowered (some are actually worse than their C-Bill variants) and so players that spend money on them have to rely more on their loadout, skill and teamwork rather than the type of 'Mech they own.

One of the biggest problems with the game is the lack of more advanced tutorials. The in-game tutorial only teaches the very basic concepts, and for everything else I had to watch tutorials on Youtube.
The performance of the game, while not terrible, is still worse than it should be, especially for a F2P game.

That being said, Mechwarrior Online is a really good game, albeit with some flaws. It is the only game I never get tired of,  and I can't wait for the new content planned for 2017 (new weapons, equipment, 'Mechs and skill trees).

I know it says i only have about 68 hrs on record at the time of writing this review but i have been playing since closed beta and trust me this game has come a long way since then. One of the main issues however still persists and that is the outdated engine the game runs on. The cryengine is a very pretty engine however PGI don't quite know how to use it well. Don't let that stop you from picking up the game even if you have never heard of Battletech or Mechwarrior before you could still have some fun. The learning curve is a very steep one although not as steep as it was in the past, early on 
there was no tutorial to teach new players the basics.
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
On to some of the good things about the game, the first being the incredibly generous F2P model this game has. You can play every single mech in the game for completely free kind of. The game operates under a ""Chassis"" system where every chassis is available for free, there are some exceptions such as newly released mechs those will be released for free shortly after however. There are special versions that offer C-Bill bonuses (the free currency, MC being the premium currency) as well as bonus to xp, those being Hero and Champion mechs. I won't get into too much detail because i am sure someone has explained it. Another great thing about this game is the fact that it get's updated every month at the very least as that is when they release new mech chassis into the game. This year they are also releasing a bunch of new weapons so this year is probably the best time to get into the game as everyone will be learning the new weapons and the meta will get shaken up quite a bit.
All in all I would say pick it up try it out and if you don't like it feel free to right a negative review because even the community knows this game isn't perfect. However it's all we have right now until the next mechwarrior game comes out later this year in the form of Battletech.",1485232711,1485232711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
342200,29425320,76561198064313174,0,1,30827,0,8386,1634933569,"First...I've only been playing for about 6 months. (We'll come back to that in a minute).

This game is a ""Stompy Robot Shooter"" game. Basically an FPS but with robots of varying size and abilities. In some ways it's like Hawken but less of a 'video game' and more of a simulation. Which is what attracted me after getting burned out from COD (especially it's new Infinite Gymnastics release). So...if you're an FPS guy....this is a good FREE TO PLAY robot FPS. 3 out 5 stars right there with no othere considerations (see below) and it's free...you can spend a LOT of money in microtransactions but you don't have to if you just want to play it casually. 

Now...If you are a Lore-Whore then this game could be bad or good depending on how you want to view it. Yes, it does have some non-cannon parts. Yes, PGI can sometimes play fast and loose with mech design and weapons....but....you can't go from tabletop to video without some changes. I, personally, like the changes.....but those with OCD might not. (More on that in a minute).

So...the game itself is pretty much like a lot of FPS games. You have teams. You have certain modes (TDM, Escort, Dom,o etc). Your weapons, while futuristic, break down into beam, ballistic, and missile. The mechs go from small to large. With the smallest being the fastest with the least armor and arms, while the Big Boys are slow but are walking bunkers.. The maps are, mostly, open so you can engage at range. (though there are some tight maps too).  If you are an FPS player its  an easy transition. You do have to watch your consumeables. You do have UAVs, System Cool Down Shots, Air/Artillary strikes...so it does have a more 'thinking' aspect to it than some of the other FPS games.  You can drop into random matches...or...join ""Faction Play"". Faction Play is currently a work in progress but has already, in my short playing time, gotten much better. You pick a side and either defend or attack to win all the planes in the games universe. You have the 'clan' (human descendents who are invading) or the ""Houses"" (star kingdoms ruled by a family or official who are defending from the clans). You'll need to read onlin and in game...LOT's of info.

Now...let's talk about the community.
I have met many awesome players and youtube posters who love the game. I've played with a few and had an absolute ball. One of the things (some) players talk about is how great the community is. For the most part it is....but....

DO NOT GO INTO THE GENERAL FORUMS...STAYIN THE NEW PLAYER FORUMS!!! >>>> There are a large percentage of 'older' players who are NOT happy with the game. They're called ""Bitter Vets"" and they can be really mean and ugly. Most because of lore...some because they don't like the way it's morphed into more of a mainstream FPS game. but mostly because the tabletop lore is not the same as an online game. (NOTE: there were PC games in the MWO genre from the 80's and 90's and some can't understand why we can't have that kind of gameplay on MWO now...so still Lore Whores but from a different generation of players).  Many of these ""Bitter Vets"" really really want this game to crash and burn  because they are so offended. Many of them have spent thousands of dollars to get every mech and they expect that the game should cater just to their needs. 

TLDR Rating?
