Interface: 2K21's interface stands out for being more minimalist and user-friendly. 2K23's interface is more complex and visually appealing, but accessing some menus can be difficult. In this regard, 2K21's interface is more functional and practical.

Gameplay: Some changes made in 2K23 make the gameplay more realistic and enjoyable than 2K21. For example, the ball physics engine has been improved, the feel of the clubs has been better reflected, and new swing mechanics have been added. These innovations make the game more challenging and rewarding.

Graphics: 2K23 has more advanced graphics than 2K21. The courses and characters in particular look more detailed and realistic.

Overall Evaluation: Both games have certain advantages from their own perspectives. 2K21 has a more user-friendly interface and simpler gameplay, while 2K23 offers a more realistic experience and more advanced graphics.

Personal Opinion: While I prefer 2K21's interface, I think 2K23's gameplay is slightly better. The ball physics engine and new swing mechanics, in particular, make the game more enjoyable.

To Help You Decide:

If you are looking for a user-friendly interface and simple gameplay: 2K21
If you are looking for a more realistic experience and more advanced graphics: 2K23
Conclusion: Which game you choose depends on your personal preferences. Both games are of a quality that will satisfy golf lovers.

Additional Points:

2K23 introduces a new career mode that is more immersive and engaging than 2K21's.
2K23 also features a wider variety of courses and golfers to choose from.
2K21 is available on more platforms than 2K23.

Go through with training and customize all your play, make sure you try with all the easy to hard settings and swing types.

No PHOTO mode either and no option to spin the ball once its in flight (granted that is a ""cheat"" and you cant do it in real life but in GTA its fun and should be an option for people who want it). You can however control ""spin"" BEFORE the shot by setting up where you want to hit the ball and at what angle. Lastly, Kinda upset that you mulligan but that is also a cheat.

I would not recommend this game to other players if they have any interest in online multiplayer. I have a regular group of friends and we try to play 4-mans all the time. Our matches have failed from random DCs, desync (two people are viewing one guy hitting, the other two a different player and neither of those players can do anything). It's incredibly frustrating that you can get an hour into a round and it just falls apart because the game can't manage to keep four players in sync with one-another (players that get booted cannot rejoin/resume the round).

Playing single player is an absolute blast (although the constant prompting to purchase stuff from the in-game store and/or battlepass is OBNOXIOUS).

Of course, I've played more than a few multiplayer rounds and even competitive/ranked mode. Along with several solo matches. There are obviously some negative reviews on here, I read more than enough before buying it. To be honest, and if you're on the fence about buying, here is my review thus far.

CHARACTER CREATION:
     You're able to create your own character of course, with a fair deal of pretty well generic clothes to choose from. I was surprised to see they had a kilt as an option, and in my family's tartan pattern and colors. You will eventually be able to unlock more clothing options in the future, after you have been through some matches. Accumulating a form of in game currency to do so. Some of those clothes are on a rotation or maybe even a limited of time only type deal.

EQUIPMENT/CLUBS:
     Clubs have two aspects, cosmetic and functional upgrades. Which are independent of each other. Has this effected my ability to compete with others? Not that I can tell. I haven't been smashed consecutively for any length of period of time. So, whatever they have balancing out game-play and/or match making; hasn't been terrible. But then again, I'm not scared to play ranked matches. I intentionally do so, so I can be matched fairly, or at least that is my intention towards the game. As I would assume and hope that, that is how the game should respond accordingly. I haven't really spent a lot of time in casual games. But, as of right now I can't speak heavily on it. One could assume that it isn't as skill driven as ranked.

RANKED/COMPETITIVE:
     Ranked matches from what I can tell, don't allow you to choose what course you will be playing on. I believe they are randomly chosen by the game itself. As this should be this way, because one person or the other could potentially have an unfair advantage if they have played a certain course repetitively. You will have to conform to a stricter style of controls. Controls have preset skill levels, varying in roughly three or more tiers (levels). Ranked forces professional mode. At my skill level and the others I have played against, it's been pretty well balanced. I was really embarrassed by how bad some of my initial shots were, until I seen my opponents shots. So no sweat if you're a beginner. I haven't seen really any pc players (steam or otherwise) yet. It's been majority (if not all) console players.

CONTROLS:
     You can obviously use a controller. I spent half of my first 30 hours on mouse and keyboard. It isn't terrible, but I think the majority of folks will want to utilize a controller for this one. Controls remind me of the old Tiger Woods golf game from around 2002, with maybe a slight twist on it. If you've played that, then this won't be an issue or deal breaker for you. They do have a driving range, and they do allow you to practice swings both on the course and the driving range. And believe me, you're going to want to spend some time at the range. It watches for how you start your swing, where you end your swing (winding back), and how fast you are swinging from the winding back. (I'm no pro golfer or anything close to that, so that's how I'm going to describe it) If you swing too fast, or too slow, it can cause a slight angle on the shot. If you're swing speed is extreme in mentioned fashion, you're in for a very disappointing shot.

THE IN GAME SHOP:
     The in game shop isn't a game breaker. In essence, it's for the majority, and mostly cosmetics. Yes they do have things that you can buy to help a bit towards your game/skill. But I'll spare you the details on that. As it is rather lengthy to explain. Just trust me when I say that it won't play an extreme effect on how well you play, or how well your opposition plays. Just helps when you are having a terrible run of shots. had some terrible shots back to back for the past three or so shots? Here's a smidgen of assist to get you back on track. As we all know, golf is really you versus you, before it is ever you versus another person. Just know that they aren't going to throw you up against someone who is higher level than you in these perks/skills. I've ran enough matches to notice/not notice. Although the shop does tend to advertise itself quite often. Which is very annoying. YES I KNOW THE SHOP IS THERE. I'll get to it when I dang well feel like it.

GRAPHICS AND SUCH:
     Graphics have been on a scale of one to five, about a four and a half. I'm running a 4060Ti and it hasn't been too hard on it. As always, results are going to vary with this, as we all don't have the same setup. It runs well for my setup.

GAME PLAY/GAME MODES:
     Game modes are very nice, more than I've seen in any other golf game that I have owned. I haven't owned them all but I'm not a total noob to this either. They even have a Top Golf range/course or whatever you call it, and yes, you can play against others on it. The game modes alone are enough to make me want to buy this game. Although I would say that if you plan on two versus two or more, try and bring a friend, as this will make match making easier and faster. They do have an in game voice chat, but I haven't really met anyone that really likes to talk on here yet, and yes they do have a mute function.

They do have the option to create custom courses, but they also have real ones as well. I haven't explored them all, and I don't know all of the big name ones out there. But from what i could see they had the ones I am familiar with as well.

FINAL THOUGHTS/SHOULD YOU BUY?:
     Other than that, I can't think of much else for now. Would I spend 60 bucks on this? Probably not, but I'm not a golf nut. I think that this game could use some fresh players to make match making go a little smother. (No big issues as of yet, but the more the merrier right?) I'm probably going to regret allowing comments on this, but just trying to be a good person.

CREATORS OF THE GAME:
Devs, if you're reading this, WHICH I DOUBT... you should make an option for those who wish not to play with perks on, to have the ability to turn them off. This way they can play against each other without worrying about playing games with it on. Or would y'all be afraid that your idea of adding rpg like perks will statistically get thrown out the window and force you to exclude it in the next edition?

Don't worry about buying the coins, as they aren't going to heavily effect your game play. 
So if you're tight on cash, it can wait.

Some Pros:
[list]
    [*]Casual multiplayer can be fun.
    [*]There are some great custom courses.
    [*]The 3-click swing system saves the game from becoming unplayable due to swing bugs like 2k21 had.
    [*]You can customize the strengths of your golfer, which is quite nice (though progression is slow, by design).

Some Cons:
[list]
    [*]Career mode is about as lifeless as a rock.
    [*]Commentary is garbage (essentially a copy paste from 2k21, where it was also trash).
    [*]The graphics are...not good for a game released in this decade.
    [*]It's pay-to-win, and the micro-transaction pricing doesn't even try to be reasonable.

The game has great moments, but all in all it's an RNG mess. Hard mode gets you circus greens that no amount of spin, shape or shot type can hold. The Rivals aspect is so lazy - if you get a 2 shot lead on your Rival, shockingly they chip in from 150yds (every time). Do yourself a huge favor and turn off Highlights so you don't have to watch the duped cut scenes every time: Trust me, they chipped it in for eagle again.

The skill point matrix is an absolute joke - half of the perks are only activated through bad shots, the other half good shots. No synergy whatsoever even in the higher tiers (e.g. Miss 3 greens and receive a Spin Boost on Flop shots - yay).

There's no true progression in this game. Skill points, club upgrades, et al. are extremely marginal boosts and overly-complex. Ultimately, your performances come down to RNG and what the swing path feels like doing that day. Even with a pristine mouse pad (or a well-calibrated controller) you are 100% going to get RNG side spin every few shots.

Another classic 2K release: A few solid ideas, hundreds of poorly-thought out ideas, and a gigantic cosmetic market. This game even has pop-up ads.

Multiplayer match making or joining/creating lobbies is abysmal, if you missed that invite from a friend, or if you clicked join when you didn't already have the game open, whelp too bad guess you aren't playing with them unless you ask for another invite.

Ads ADS ADDDDSSS the advertisements in this game to buy other games or other things for this game that I can not disable or skip is INFURATING for a game that has already been paid for, there is only one excuse for this and it is because 2k is churning these games out without fixing problems then they dupe you into the next purchase because you think to yourself ""Surely they fixed all of the problems from the one 2 years ago"" NOPE still all of the same complaints.

For one, there are terrible lag issues, even if you have the necessary specs (which I do). The game uses so many resources, which causes lag and makes the game straight-up unplayable often. The swing timing is super inconsistent. You'll do one shot and it says ""Very Fast"" even when you slow down your swing. Then two holes later you'll do the same speed and it'll say ""Very Slow"" and your shot is shanked the other way. The lag doesn't help this either, and neither does the swing calibration. I tried this and there wasn't any noticeable improvement. Your ""caddy"" in-game is clueless and often doesn't choose the right club. 

The customization options for your player's apparel and clubs are cool and there's a good selection, though only having one option for a Nike shirt feels weird and a lot of the club selections are way due for updates. The course creator is also a unique feature; people can create some amazing designs. Just don't do the auto-designed layouts. They're terrible.

The lines of the greens are often misleading to a point where even if there is no movement the ball at times will still break on putts over 10ft. The competitive mode is a great addition to the game, however, often times because of how few players there are you will end up playing against others who are 2-3 full ranks ahead of you (Par to Eagle).

The 3 Click mouse pad controls are also less 'classical' than the EA 3 Click keyboard system.

Lack of attention to detail from 2K23 : On the green, the flad is taken out (otherwise it's a penalty shot), so when your ball rebounds of the flag, when you're o the green - WTF !

Fun (8.5/10):
It's Fun Games (makes me scratch my head, and so many facepalm from failed putting and overshoot). 

Swing Controls (6/10):
Not really hard to play with 3 click, for analog swing it's much harder comparing with EA PGA Tour using analog controller, so I still prefer EA PGA Tour Analog Swing which I feel more forgiving.

Performance (5/10):
Don't know why with standart graphic setting my 5 years old potato laptop handle EA PGA Tour better than 2K23, or even previos series 2K21.

Graphic & Scenery (7.5/10):
With Standart setting for my laptop (High Setting) compared to EA PGA Tour I still choose EA PGA Tour which is more polished, and more beautiful. I can't go ultra without affecting performance on both games so I compare High vs High.

Course Designer (8/10):
Course Designer, yeah. even I'm suck at designing beautiful course. but I think the tools for edit landscape and Create Surface need more work, quite hard to use it (I'm Suck at it) and still dont know how to create cliff, also need to add more water effect and Object I think.

Sound & Commentator (6.5/10):
Ok, nothing special, the sound of hitting ball with driver is a little off and ball landing on FIR / GIR sound same. Commentator a little bit boring/bland comparing to EA PGA Tour.

Menu & Play Mode (8/10):
Menu a little bit complicated for me, too many feature/menu and submenu, but It's still good to have much feature and hey its responsive and no stuck issue like on EA PGA Tour (which is unresponsive and sometimes stuck).

Ads (3/10):
Like playing Free mobile games, too many ads.

Replayability (999/10):
Play anytime no finish/ending

This is the ABSOLUTE worst golf game in the series that I've played to date!

Graphics are pretty good, but very poor mechanics, ANNOYING as hell commentary, and cut scenes to competitors are absolutely horrible!  I'm a scratch golfer,  been golfing for many years, and the golf ball doesn't fly the way it does in this game! It's actually comical!  Wedge shots and green side bunker shots completely roll off the green at times, even when lob mode is selected - it's a total joke!

Had to turn off the commentary as it is really negative. Character animations get upset at times I think a shot/putt was good but didn't go in the hole. Models have crazy eyes and look creepy on the course.

The game really likes random 10mph winds. 
1/2 the skills are basically useless unless you struggle getting on the fairway/green. 
You get fittings by playing the game but still have to pay to have them put on a club which seems like a dumb idea. 
Sponsors and Rivals give a lot of cosmetics which is nice.
You can customize your clubs a lot without having to unlock colors for the shafts/grips which is nice.
Tons of courses to play on.
Crowd wont shut up during play always a constant drone and had to turn them down.
Would be nice to have an 'Always Fast Forward Option' Game play is a bit slow but I guess it is golf.

It has numerous issues;
They keep pushing micro transactions its annoying.
1) Sponsorship system is completely broken. Win 2 tournaments in a row, with many 2nd places, then have 1 rough tournament ? Well to bad you lose your sponsorship. 
2) Shot timing is unintuitive. Would recommend just turning this off as a QOL improvement. 
3) Graphics should be better. Characters have a uncanny valley feel to them.
4) More club choices are needed.

I am astonished at every negative review or comment that I read regarding this game. No, I am NOT related to or employed by the developers. I state it clearly and unequivocally.

But I love this game. On my computer and internet, at least, which consist of a decent gaming desktop and a relatively slow internet, I am having no significant difficulties and marvel at the fact that this is a real game of skill, at which one may improve. I think this game is brilliant and beautiful. Plain and simple. The best video golf game I've ever encountered, and I started long ago with Links. Which was very good for its time. Hell, it's probably still good, if you can use it.

I think the normal, full asking price for this game is both fair and worth it. Will you have to work a bit and practice to ""get good"" ? Well, would you really want it if you didn't?

After almost 300 hours of gameplay, I're raised my solo and duo ratings for online play into the 400s. That's not bad at all! But there are sharks in the water MUCH higher than that. This has become a serious hobby. I think it's that good and engaging.

The character creation is pretty crappy too.  The slider options are quite limited and don't make a drastic difference to your face.  A lot of expected sliders are not available, like chin height and eye height or size.

The presentation is a bit lacking.  I expect much more from that department, especially since that's the only area 2K focuses on their basketball franchise these days.

The previous installments of ""The Golf Club"" continued to iterate in ways that made the game deeper and more fun... Until 2k happened.

The actual gameplay is only okay, so I can't justify this game as long as TGC2019 exists.

[h1]FULL REVIEW[/h1]

I want to play ""My Career"" mode without needing an internet connection. Every shot, every hole, every round, and every menu selection are followed by network requests. You cannot even [i]pause[/i] the game without waiting for a network event to complete. Even with outstanding internet speed, it just feels awful. After [i]every round[/i] of My Career mode, you're slammed with pop-up modal after pop-up modal of what brand ([i]cough advertisement cough[/i]) does or does not want to sponsor you. The UX is laughably bad, and I am constantly pressing the ""A"" button in this game to move onto the [i]next[/i] pop-up, skip an animation, or get to the part of the game where I am actually [i]playing golf[/i].

As for online play - there is nothing less incentivizing than the amount of time it takes to play a match. You're stuck waiting for your opponent's swing to load, long after you should have received it. The swing animations online are so poorly synced to the incoming data that it destroys any immersion anyway. The commentary provides hilariously inaccurate shot feedback, and became annoyingly redundant after just 4 rounds of play. I had to turn it off completely.

Finally, despite the [i]many[/i] courses that this game features, they all feel the same. The 17th at sawgrass may as well be any other municipal course. It's not an immersive or distinguished feeling. If you've played 5 courses, you've played them all.

If the game didn't have any of these issues, TGC2019 is still a better experience. Having bought 2k23 on sale, I regret my purchase and time spent. I paid 20$ for 2k23 (on sale) to play what feels like a free-to-play, advertisement ridden, micro-transaction filled pile of mediocrity.",1702323118,1702323720,False,1,1,0,1,True,False,False

You need to understand that there are many different level of gamers out there. It would be lovely to play golf, as the last games I played that I actually enjoyed were the tiger woods games on ps2. All you had to do was make it accessible to all and it would be doing far better than the borderline dead it's already at now.

Gave it one more try to be fair, but I can't cope with this junk anymore..
Clubs are ruined.
Putting is ruined.
Some of the assist tools either do not work, or work differently.
1 out of 5 shots do not go where you aimed. Hit it perfectly and just completely goes the wrong way or distance. Last %91 needed for chip to hole, accidentally went %96 and it went from a 30ft chip, to a 51ft putt on the far side of the green, just for %5.
The commentator Hetty, sounds aweful.

I play this on a 5900x/4090 setup and usually play this game on an LG OLED  4K @ 120hz and it is a wonderful expreience...  HDR in this game is really good as well. 

Only negative I think needs mentioned is that most people, including myself, do expreience a random freeze-up and crash once in a while and it seems nobody has a solution.  I have heard it is very sensitive to overclocked gpus.  Some people experience it more than others, but everyone has it happen once in a while.

I am allowing comments on this review so anyone that sees it and knows a solution to the freezing can reply with what they know.  After spending a couple hours on google/reddit, I wasn't able to  find anyone who had found a good answer on preventing the  game from locking up.  I normally wouldn't even blame a game for this, but I do not have this issue with any other game on my computer and plenty of them are more demanding than this on both cpu and gpu.  I sold a 10th gen i7/3080 setup i built to  a friend and the game is more stable on his computer while running practically the same settings (Pretty sure he neds to run DLSS at 4k and I do not...and his is more stable... Maybe more of an AMD issue?)

- One is sometimes the player will change clubs/flop etc. and it won't represent properly on the player screen in multiplayer.
- Another is sometimes there will be disconnects from multiplayer gameplay in particular. While I think this issue has been resolved for the most part, it's still a potential problem and seems to vary day by day.
- Lack of backspin in rough lies. I understand spinning a ball is tough to do, but i've watched pros do it in play and they should be far inferior to what a virtual character can do reliably.
- Rarely there'll be an end of hole for a team even though they're tied in shots. This results in the other team gaining a 1up. May also happen in 1v1, not sure.
- Wind doesn't register on shots properly. Let's say it displays 0mph on client screen. On alternative screen it might show 3mph. Which is a huge difference, and results in longer putts because of misreading shots.",1666030649,1699744315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyhoo, I like it now.  It plays the same as 2K21, with slightly improved ball physics.

Overall I'm having a lot of fun with it and I'd say it's absolutely worth getting even if you already have 2K21.  I might wait for a sale, but you'll be glad when you have it.

I do have two complaints:

1. How much crack has Justin Thomas smoked in this game?????
2. Why is the commentary (despite the majority of it being from 2K21) now such crappy sound quality?  Hard consonants are distorted and harsh on the hearing.

After 40 hours of play time, a random game crash caused me to lose all of my profile settings (character customization and all settings reset).  Worst of all was losing all equipped club fittings which must be enabled by using in-game currency, which you have to grind hard to earn, or buy through your Steam wallet.   This is the most important section of the game to increase your player abilities.  These were all lost...  This would be similar to losing all of your Counter Strike skins you bought due to a game crash. And.... the support team won't help you restore them.  No effort at all to help you troubleshoot or investigate, they just ignore you.

A poor game design saves your club fittings in your local computer user profile settings, so if this single file gets corrupted, you permanently lose everything when it syncs with the cloud after relaunching the game.  Apparently a common game crash corrupts the settings file and you lose your profile.

After contacting support, I've received no response going on 3 days now.  That's poor customer service there.  Also, an official post by 2K support forums adamantly points out they do not restore settings or issue lost VC.  This is totally unacceptable.  There should never be a situation where a bug in the game or a crash causes a user to permanently lose in-game items they've purchased or earned.  And no option to recover them.  I won't give the game another dollar to re-purchase that stuff.  Game crashes in PGA Tour 2k23 are common I hear, and I've seen a few YouTube videos of dedicated 2K players that have lost months of progress due to similar issues.  NO support.  Full of ads too.  Do not buy.

Revision after an additional 40 hours of play:

DO NOT BUY.  Lost 5,000 VC tonight due to ""network connection lost"" multiple times after the game disconnected DURING skins games.  After about 8 games of crashes during skins, I quit.  EVERY skins game crashed causing me to lose the entire 750 VC buy-in.  My internet is not the problem... I'm hardwired GIG Fiber.  NO connection losses.  I have network logs and there were NO OUTAGES.  Other people crashed too tonight and I earned their 750 VC when they were force quit due to 2k's crappy servers crashes.  It's the games servers fault.  SHIT game.

BTW, their support did credit me 600 VC for my ORIGINAL crash a month ago which erased ALL club fittings.  They said they did it ""for my trouble""....  It cost me around 3,500 VC to re-fit them.  The 600 VC didn't come close to covering the cost of the fittings which was a result of a crash not of my fault.  TERRIBLE!

Revision after an additional 40 hours of play:

After another 40 hours since my last review update and finally receiving much better support from 2K sports, I'm changing my review from not recommended, to recommended.  Support did end up crediting me VC when they had some server instability issues causing people to lose their VC credits.  I had to provide a thorough explanation and evidence.

Overall the game is really fun in ranked mode, and that's the main reason I'm sticking with it.  But they really need to solve the bugs around game crashes and losing VC credits.  Make sure to backup your local user profile on Windows PC so you can restore it if necessary.

I miss the golf games that got it right, the ones that were truly fun (like the EA games back in the early to mid 2000's). Where do I begin... the greens are terrible, a slight miss and the ball could go miles even if the power was spot on. The stick sensitivity is too much, it changes far to frequently, even after you upgrade your clubs the timing is never the same. The wind drove me crazy - while I love having to factor the wind into my shots the game decides sometimes even after you factor it in it will all of a sudden have zero effect while on others it could drive your shot so far out. The game doesn't display elevation of the hole which makes it a real pain to figure out how your shot will bounce or roll (or not). If you decide to do realistic 4 round tournaments, be prepared that the game decides on round 4 that its going to ruin all the potentially great rounds you had before it. If you were up by 10 strokes, you can kiss those goodbye, no matter how much you practice swing or take your time - something is bound to go epically wrong. I'm not sure if this is their way of trying to create drama within the game or suspense, all it did was make me question why I have wasted so much time playing. I started laughing a lot at this next one, when you are in career mode you have to face ""rivals"" which means they cut to another golfer that you are ""beefing"" with and almost every cut scene shows that rival hitting insanely amazing shots (one after another). I cant complain about the announcers, if you play sports games they are bound to piss you off, its just the nature of it. Last big issue is that the game just completely freezes randomly and requires a hard reset. This can be frustrating as sometimes it saves EXACTLY where you were OR a hole or two before (based on the laundry list of stuff mentioned about this can add to your nightmare). 

2k, 
We deserved better. At the very least can you add in a button where I get to break a club or tomahawk it across the fairway or something, I feel like our created players deserve to show how pissed they are at you too. 
Also, to all of the above, WHY?

Potential buyers & Friends, 
Just get one of the classics and replay it. I should have done that from the start but someone has to be the huckleberry. I do not know how this game got mostly good reviews. While you may read this and say I love a good challenge in a game, well so do I, this isn't that.

Sometimes the announcers can be annoying, but you can disable almost all aspects of the UI/UX to be an experience that you like.

Also, there is only 1 mode for very larger groups, and it seems like you might still be limited to 4 players for your party for those.

The latter seemed to improve matters, but only temporarily. I have also performed windows system file checks and reinstalled mouse and keyboard drivers. The M2 SSD drives are optimised.
Other quite demanding games (Doom, Doom Eternal, Need for Speed) perform faultlessly; it is just this one game having problems.
I would have recommended this game were it not for the present jerkiness. When the game is communicating with the internet it seems slow despite my fast fibre connection; that may be significant.

First off, the game crashes too often for something in production for over a year.  Secondly, I made two in game purchases in the last 48 hours for VC (virtual currency) for the sole purpose of applying fittings.  Club fittings improve your character's clubs and you can adjust as you desire (increase power, improve swing, improve accuracy, more forgiveness etc...)  I had run out of VC and was adjusting my fittings having just learned more about how they function and affect the game.  The purchases completed successfully and I used the in game VC to apply fittings.  So yesterday we're good.

Upon reaching level 50 today the game glitched.  My entire was character was reset including the character's appearance, it's clothes and nationality.  My skill build was reset.  My clubs were reset.  All the things you establish when you first install and play the game--which I did 4 weeks ago.

More crucial is that ALL my club fittings were removed.  Fittings that I literally paid to apply via in game purchases within the last 48 hours for a total of $32.23.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1695925657,1695925657,True,1,4,0.42528262734413147,1,True,False,False

Cons: it's annoying when first time after install when you enter a menu. It has a space bar system of progression to inform you of functionality which may confuse you as it did me. Keep hitting space bar then the prompts advance to completion (took me a few minutes of frustration to realise that)

(A few weeks in and I have the below to add)

Been waiting since... Links 386 Pro?  But every time I load up the game 2K is shoving ads in my face to try to make me spend more money on the game for worthless crap.  I already paid you for the game.  Leave me alone.

Correct me if I am wrong, but the game is called PGA Tour 2K23, not LPGA Tour 2K23, right?  I have no problem with having an LPGA mode alongside the PGA mode, where you make an LPGA player and play from the ladies' tees.  But for all the people that clamor on about immersion in games, nothing is more immersion breaking in a PGA game than having three women leading the Fed Ex Cup standings.  Was 2K just too lazy to program two different tours and two different sets of tees?  I expect this kind of laziness from EA, but I guess 2K is just as lazy.

I also do not understand what the announcer is talking about half the time.  I line up for a put and he says ""they need to save this for par."" Who are the people he is talking about?  I see only one person putting.  But at other times you hear things like ""he hit a nice one there.""  Ok, I understand that.  Is it just sloppy implementation, or was 2K too lazy to record all the lines twice (once for male players, once for female)?

It’s beyond clear that this was a cash-grab opportunity, capitalizing on the success of a decent start-up with 2K21. The Unity engine is not a good engine for golf in my own opinion. With the lack of optimization, every other swing will hang on your back swing and cause a fast or slow swing. I’m not sure if this is a PC-only thing but it’s been consistent on several different computers with varying parts from an RX 580 to an RTX 4080. It doesn’t help that they were so focused on drip-feeding content for the first few months of release that they glossed over every major bug in the game. They made online unplayable with patches more than once and on launch the 2v2 playlist didn’t work at all. 

Originally this review talked about how hopeful I was that maybe they could fix the issues and they never did. I was even hopeful for EA’s attempt but everything with EA seems to crumble nowadays. I really do miss those days when companies didn’t make insane amounts of money and had to grind out those 40-hour work weeks to make some of the best damn games you’ve ever seen. It really is starting to feel like some of these amazing companies are just shells. 

Honestly if you want a really fun golf game, just go to your local simulator or course. Some course fees are only like 20$. If you’re rich enough, buy a home sim. Do anything but play this game. Unless your idea of a good time is playing a half-finished game listed at full price go ahead. But I don’t think this game will get better with age.

Cons-
-Pop ups almost every time you go to main menu trying to get you to buy this or that in micro transactions. I already paid for the game, stop trying to shove your ""weekly special"" coin prices down my throat. 

-FPS drops randomly throughout the match, messing up your swing timing. 

-Coins are nearly impossible to come by, probably to try to persuade people to buy them instead- so dont expect to be able to customize your character much unless you grind endlessly for them. You would think for winning a tournament you would get some amount of monetary reward, but you dont other than maybe $100 for a sponsor reward.

Pros
- Good amount of realism setting up for shots reading the course & lie. It's quite satisfying when you read the course right & hit a good shot!
- I really appreciate all the gameplay settings to fine tune the difficulty to what you want.
- TopGolf was a pleasant surprise!

Cons
- Expect random freezes & crashes about once every round or two
- Game occasionally lags during back swing which will throw off your timing. (I doubt my 4080 & 5800X are the problem.)
- Replays are basically useless with their lack of camera options & replay functions. Also, they will occasionally just show the golfer's face instead of the ball. So weird.
- Courses roll & bounce like they are made of concrete. (Pro Tip: Spend all your in-game money on balls with less roll & bounce)
- The greens are a joke. They make the game unplayable most of the time. Rolling friction doesn't exist & the slopes rival that of hills! (*Disclaimer: I play golf, but I've never putted on a PGA Tour green, so maybe that's really how they are. I doubt it though based on what I see on TV.)
- Announcers & reports only have about 20 commentary phrases. They get annoying pretty quick. (Pro Tip: Turn them off for a better experience. It will feel like you're really on the course where there aren't any announcers, only the sounds of clubs hitting the ball & the crowd clapping. Pure golf & very soothing.)

The physics of this game are way off. Some greens are simply unplayable because even if you hit the green with a long to mid-iron, the ball will not stick. The spins and bounces are ridiculous. I wish the mechanic from the old Tiger Woods games was still around where you could actually control some aspects of the spin. But in this game, you have no control even if you hit a high lofted shot the ball will go wherever it wants to randomly. Also, the timing aspect of shots is ridiculous as well. It feels inconsistent, you feel like you timed a shot really well but then somehow it is way fast or way slow. In a round, I might have maybe 5 shots that the timing says perfect, when I know for a fact that my timing is better than that. I think sometimes the game decides where it wants your ball to go no matter what you do.

EXCEPT and the only criticism... is that when they commentate they always say, ""they"" when they refer to you... It commonly makes you think that they're talking about all of the golfers but you always realize that they're talking about you.  I've never heard the word, ""they"" used so much in my life... it is a little annoying.
However... that is literally my only complaint.
I play on a rig whose devices are at least 6 years old... 6 year old, mobo, cpu, gpu and RAM and I have absolutely no issues with playing it smoothly.  It's a beautiful, relaxing game with what seems like the perfect mechanics to controls shots.
I've only played through all of the tutorials but it seems perfect.  Plus?  The commentary was smart and reacting to my shots very well.
This game is the best golf game I've ever played and I've been playing video games since the late 80's...
People who gave the game a poor review are self-entitled, technoweenie, irresponsible clowns who need to put some of the onus of games playing well on themselves.
If my old rig plays this game perfectly then yours should also.  You most likely just suck at managing your computer and it's a potato accordingly.  Your fault not this game's.

Luckily your characters levels don't reset and you keep your fittings but sometimes your fittings get taken off your clubs which costs VC (real money or time to earn) to put back on. Sometimes when transitioning between players it sits on a black screen forcing you to close the game because it's stuck. The game will sometimes stutter during your golf swing which is the literally the only execution during gameplay which is unforgivable(Some days it happens multiple times in a match other days it works fine). The game used to crash for me pretty often but that hasn't happened in a while and could've been my PC(idk about console). 
         The game also has some really dumb features or lack thereof such as:  Pay to win balls that cost VC, so if you don't cough up the money it could be the difference between making a green or not(they can add up to 15 yards to a swing if you choose the loft ball) When calibrating your swing in training mode if you mess up at all it can make your swing feel extremely off and there's no way to reset it back to default so you have to do it over and over till it's right or be left with an almost unusable swing. 
        When the game is working properly it's an amazing game but with all the major and minor issues it can be extremely frustrating. The improvements from pga 2k21 are great such as, better soundtrack, crossplay for  much shorter queue times, ranked mode, way more customization with clubs. But almost every time I get on the game at least 1 of these issues are present and it's seriously hindered the enjoyment of the experience. You're better off getting pga 2k21 which has it's own issues but pretty much the only solid choices for golf games on PC are 2k21 and 2k23.",1693077255,1693077255,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love golf video games. I loved 2K21. This game could be decent, but instead of a solid foundation and some basic online modes that have worked without fail for a long time...we get this BUGGY mess. Online game crashes are routine in society events (hence the dead societies and lack of tournaments). Some societies have been around for years, and this game killed them. You would think though that these problems wouldn't extend to offline career play though. You would however be wrong, and to add insult to injury, you have to have an online connection to play career mode...so if you lose internet for any reason and want to play this offline, you're **** out of luck. Past all that though, frame rate issues (that were never present in 2K21) are a common thing here. Holding Y to speed up my shot results in glitchy ball flight and regardless of whether or not I hold Y after hitting the ball, there is always some graphical error of some kind when my ball is on the way to the green. Beyond the actual software issues though is a very poorly done gallery for a game released in 2022. The patrons do not look real, reach to anything you do, or do anything other than distract from some decent looking courses. I think the physics are fine, and I could deal with the poor quality player animations (WHICH ARE INSANELY REPETITIVE TO BOOT), but the other issues are game breakers and theres nothing worse than being halfway through a society match with no swing meter and you finally get in a groove...and your game crashes.

Although I believe that there are some serious downsides affecting both the late-game playability and online-matchmaking that should have been addressed long ago and leave the game feeling stale and needing something more as you put in more hours.

Firstly, coins become extremely slow to grind above level 40, and hey sure if you're great, you can jump in the high roller online matches for 750 coins and make some money, but that's not for everyone. The store advertisements that pop into your face nearly every time you go into the main menu for some insanely inflated in-game currency microtransaction, really put a tamper on the expectation that the developers have the games best intents at heart as well. 

Secondly, this game really needs to separate lobbies in online matchmaking for those using swing-stick and those using 3-click (the game's different golf swing styles). There is an outrageous difference between the skill required between the two methods and in my opinion as a swing-stick user (on mouse and keyboard), a much greater satisfaction of hitting a great shot in tricky conditions using swing-stick.. The fact that I am forced to play against 3-click users for the same ranked leader board is quite shocking.

If these issues are addressed then the game will have a lot more weight, but doubtful that it will be fixed before the next edition is released, cheers.

This should be my very last edit
I already talked about the awful servers/matchmaking before, but it got a lot worse recently.
Here's a list of the multitudes of issues I encounter on a regular basis day after day for the past 3+ months

- Games do not start and softlock to that ""Game Starting"" countdown at 9
- Games that do start very often take upwards to 3 minutes to load, if they ever even want to actually load into the match
- Ragequitters causing the game to softlock for everyone else, forcing you to alt-f4 or wait for who knows how long for the server to stop freaking out
- Game also started to crash for no apparent reason in the middle of the game
- Hiccups/Frameskips got even worse than before. They now last for half a second instead of 2-3 frames

ADDENUM March 18th

Crossplay was added, which revitalized the Online scene
HOWEVER. The games still suffer from constant softlocks and crashes. Happens frequently whenever someone ragequits and the servers can't handle it. Otherwise it just softlocks or crashes for no reason.
Nothing has been done to fix the tempo, which has been proven to be awfully coded and dependent of the current FPS, sometimes even making the dial impossible to land on the Perfect spot. 3-click has an inherent advantage due to that.
Very high chance I'll be moving from that golf game to the one EA is going to be releasing soon, though I'll have to first check on it. You know, in case it will require a sense of pride and accomplishment. We'll see what happens

ADDENUM October 28th

An update has been released with no changelogs to be found. No communication whatsoever beside one single tweet vaguely mentioning about bug fixes. The tempo with the mouse feels just a tad better, but I still cannot hit Perfect consistently at all, and calibration still does nothing at all. I'm forced to play with a very slow mouse pointer otherwise my shots are always too fast. The game now also tends to lock up very often, even in single player

The official steam forum for the game's moderation team (I think it's only one guy) seems to be out of whack about deleting criticism on the game. I just noticed many of my messages being deleted without notice, with one from 2 weeks ago given a warning for being ""abusive"" and hilariously mentioned that I bypassed the swear filter, when the filter itself was activated to censor the word. Another message was deleted for criticizing the devs (No insults of any kind done beside saying they lazily programmed the code) for still making it possible to use the edge of the screen to hit the ball straight.
While this isn't really game related per se, it really doesn't help its case when some random guy shuts down any sort of criticism about the game, and felt it was important to note everyone else.

ADDENUM October 24th

While my gripes with the tempo are still correct, it being harder and less consistent compared to 2k21 may be due to starting with low stats. However I tried with the rhythm archetype and I did not see any major difference. The lob wedge was harder to hit perfect compared to my 290y driver from 2k21, let that sink in.

I have lost a bunch of fittings fo no good reason a while back. This has been reported by many other players. Another thing to add to the list on why I don't really like the game

--- Beginning of the review ---

For insight, I've been playing The Golf Club 19 and 2k21 for the past 3-4 years. I'm not going to be easy on this game this time.

The game as it currently is, has a huge amount of issues. I was actually quite excited to get my hands on it and hoped for something great, since the jump from 19 to 21 was pretty good and massive. However this time, all I got were disappointment and frustrations.

The game does have some positives still. The music is pretty dam good in this game. The skills and archetypes are pretty good additions to the game. The menus do look a lot nicer and cleaner. The Driving range looks awesome and useful this time. Punch shots are actually back. There are no more putt previews by default in matchmaking, thank God. Voice Chat is actually a thing now, which can be hilarious at times. I love it. However, those are the only positives I can think of.

Graphics wise, the game looks marginally better than 2k21, which is fine with me since 2k21 was already looking quite good. However I've seen my share of awful textures from time to time, like flat heavy rough and some weird high contrast cloud like textures on the sand and sometimes the fairway (It gets worse when seen under the shade). Water reflection is still pretty bad when your character is in the way, which seems to be due to the Unity engine.

It is currently 2022, and their game still does not have the ability to play against CPUs. A 2022 full price game, gets his butt handed to it by Mario Golf, a game from 1999. A simple feature still completely absent. I expected the game to contain a lot of other modes and things to do in single player, but absolutely nothing was done about that, which still leaves the game with an awful value for what it costs to buy compared to many other golf games that did a lot better such as Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005

The microtransaction aspect of the game is getting worse and worse. You now have to buy your clubs looks, then spend more VCs for fittings. This makes getting clubs with good stats 2-3 times more expensive than in 2k21, and very frustrating to get since they do not seem to drop at all when playing matchmaking, only on single player matches, sometimes. Then, you can spend even more for custom balls that only last for one round each. The game still features season passes, which still do not belong in a full price game. For now, it's still not as bad as other 2K games, yet, but it's slowly getting there.

To go along the possibility of buying balls with very low roll stat, the greens are now made extremely slippery, even on very slow greens (115f). They've been made so absurdly slippery, that it has to have been purposefully done so people are enticed to buy VCs to get golf balls with low rolls.

The tempo mechanics are absolutely busted. I've been playing 2k21 for 2 years on Pro difficulty. I would hit Perfect about 75% of the time after getting used to the tempo, very consistently. However now in 2k23, hitting the Perfect on Pro is impossible. It is always either too slow or fast. It is also very easy to hit very fast or slow compared to 2k21. I've been hitting perfect for about 5% of the time.
The mechanics are copied pasted from 2K21, and the same stupid crap about the dial sensitivity being linked to the FPS is still present. Good luck playing on 60 FPS : The dial will either be Perfect, Slow on the edge of the gray area, or Fast on the edge of the gray area, with zero inbetween. Since 2K23 loves to be surrounded with issues, the dial in my case never sets in the center, but slightly to the right whenever I'm lucky to hit Perfect. Guess what happens when I ""hit"" Perfect and my power is 101%+ : It becomes Slow due to the white area shrinking. Wonderful.
Calibrating does absolutely nothing. In fact, it's apparently bugged on the XBox version. Trust me, I tried many times to calibrate, and they clearly do not change the swing tempo whatsoever.

The game overall has been a huge letdown for me the more I played it. I still have my hopes they will fix the rough edges and hopefully the tempo mechanics in the near future. But for now, the game's getting my thumbs down. It may change if most of the issues, especially the tempo, are fixed.",1666152041,1691948029,False,11,0,0.577302992343902588,0,True,False,False

Moving on to the UI... the game hangs at every loading screen.  I assume this is something to do with communicating with 2K's servers.  Either way, sometimes you can't even play because it will just hang there indefinitely requiring multiple tries just to get yourself onto the main menu.

If that isn't bad enough, the editions of this game can cost almost $200 and you'll still get berated with constant pop-ups to buy stuff through micro-transactions.

Golf, as it is, involves a unique connection with nature and oneself, where the focus is not just on winning, but on experiencing an immersive, serene ambiance. The video game industry has long struggled to encapsulate the essence of this seemingly simple yet infinitely complex sport. Enter PGA Tour 2K23: an artful combination of immaculate graphics, intricate gameplay, and the ultimate attention to detail that crafts a gameplay experience that's as mesmerizing as it is challenging.

From the moment you lay your eyes on the game's cover, there is a promise of an unparalleled, deeply immersive golfing experience. And oh, how splendidly it delivers! Developed by HB Studios and published by 2K Sports, PGA Tour 2K23 not only upholds but advances the legacy of its predecessor with remarkable finesse and skill.

The visual allure of PGA Tour 2K23 is simply breathtaking. Each course, from the soft sunlight hitting the verdant green to the shadows of the towering trees swaying with the breeze, encapsulates the ethereal beauty of nature. The lighting, textures, and shadows are stunningly realistic, reflecting the time of day, the weather conditions, and even the subtle dew on the grass. This visual symphony is accentuated by the game's sound design - the soft rustle of leaves, the distant song of birds, the satisfying thud of club meeting ball - everything serves to wrap the player in a cocoon of immersive tranquility.

The character models and animation are a level above any golf game I've seen. The way your golfer shifts weight, the tension in the swing, even the nuances in facial expressions - it's all rendered with meticulous accuracy. The clothing and equipment are also spot on, representing a wide range of popular golf brands, providing an extra layer of authenticity.

PGA Tour 2K23's gameplay is where the magic truly unfolds. Every swing feels intuitive yet demands precision and strategic thought. The newly introduced swing mechanics add a depth of realism to the game that's thrilling and challenging. The complex factors such as wind direction, ball lie, and club selection come into play and contribute significantly to the realism of the golfing experience.

One particular aspect of the game that impressed me was the improved AI, which now simulates a range of player skills and styles. This enhances the competition, as you're not just up against a soulless, perfect machine, but a digital adversary who can make brilliant shots and, yes, occasional mistakes. This variability makes each tournament a unique experience.

The career mode is a well-crafted journey. It gives you a sense of progression, with sponsors, challenges, and various tournaments that allow you to carve your unique path to glory.

One might argue that PGA Tour 2K23 has a steep learning curve due to its complex swing mechanics and a host of factors influencing each shot. However, I see this as an aspect that pays homage to the real-life complexities of golf. It beckons you to respect the sport's intricacies and rewards patience and practice with a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, PGA Tour 2K23 is a marvel in the genre of sports simulation games. It captures the essence of golf with a level of realism, attention to detail, and respect for the sport that is seldom seen. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, the game offers an enriching, immersive, and yes, challenging experience that grows on you. It's not just about the leaderboard; it's about the journey, the swing, the hit, and the moment of truth when the ball meets its destination. This game is a hole-in-one on all fronts.

But if it was a rating out of five stars, I'd only give it a 3. I have several issues with the game that seem like they should be a given and easy fixes for such a massive studio.

1. The servers are absolute trash. The game goes down at least once a week, if not more often. Sometimes its an error message stating a network issue, sometimes it won't even boot up at all. The game crashes at least once a day, whether playing online or playing career mode, it'll just randomly freeze up and I have to end process through task manager. It seems to happen more often when playing online. Which leads me into #2

2. Every single round you play uses a ball - whether it ends early from your opponent ragequitting, or from the server dumping someone in the middle of a match. If you're playing competitively and using an epic level ball, the costs add up very quickly because of this. A round should not use a ball unless the round is completed.

3. Three click should not be allowed in PVP. I played with swing stick for the first several months, and once I got to Pro level and started playing online it became obvious that you cannot compete with people who use three click. I've since switched over and it is at least 10 times easier than swing stick. It's really not a fair game if you're using swing stick online. 

4. Online play needs more options other than just 1V1 and 2v2 match play, and it needs proper stats tracking as well. It would be cool to be able to look at how I've shot over the past few matches or all-time like you can in career mode. 

Overall it's a really great game, I haven't had this much fun on a golf game in ages, but it's being held back by the issues stated above.",1691358397,1691358397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So... what's wrong with it?

First, the UI is just horrible. It's slow to load, counterintuitive, and just clunky. Course selection is just an exercise in frustration. 

The graphics are great compared with games made 10 years ago. Today, they're underwhelming at best.

The swing mechanics just baffle me. Trying to swing consistently has been nearly impossible. I'm not sure what they added, but it almost feels random. You start to feel like you have it down, and then it hits you, and when it does, it's not a minor flaw. It'll be major. You can go from shooting an eagle to shooting four over on two holes.

Lastly... it's buggy. If the game crashes and I've experienced this frequently, there is no recovery. You're out of the match. Everyone backs out and we start over.

Tips for new people to game- 
-Play story mode with 1 round per event setting to progress rivals+sponsorships quickly and get club fittings+cash and grind exp to get some talent points and whatnot(online is very few holes and slow pace of play, exp is like 20x slower online)
-COMBINE YOUR CLUB FITTINGS, you can combine 3 club fittings to create a higher rarity one, and use that to work useless or lower rarity ones up to legendary quality. Then combine 3 legendary(orange) or epic(purple) ones to create a specific fitting for any particular club(POWER TYPE DRIVER HEAD FIRST, ADDS MOST DRIVE POWER/DISTANCE)
-if you want to play online mostly, practice using PRO settings in story mode because its locked to that online. Dont be afraid to use 3 click swing style if you cant get the hang of the normal stick style!
-Stick with Rhythm archetype/spec unless you are insanely comfortable with the swing stick, or feel as though youve mastered 3 click and never miss hit anymore. If you get to that point, go ahead and swap to Powerhouse, but truly its not much of a difference. A moderately skilled player with Rhythm can hit 103%-110% power drives that go basically the same as powerhouse without sacrificing swing difficulty on every single shot to do so.

Feel free to add me if you want some more tips or just someone decent to play with! My first season playing ranked and im closing in on Eagle rank, which is like.. platinum rank or something in other game terms? :P 82 hrs played and i think i have 7-8 hole in ones now, an albatross or two and a bajillion eagle hole outs/chips so I'm definitely decent :D

I'm not perfect, but between previous EA hockey and golf games using the right stick to aim, I'm at least decent at aiming my shots; with the default settings you might as well measure aiming in microns; any tiny variation with your aim can mean being 40+ degrees off where you're trying to aim.

Calibrating the controller helps a lot, but is still worse than previous versions of the game I played on console.

Character creation worse than before, and really uggly. Honestly, what you got from ME: Andromeda was better than this, and it was slaughtered for it.
Replay of your opponents. Some times they have their ball behind their heels and club plays through their legs. That's on the course and green. Then you have those times you don't see the ball or result, only the player, but that happens to your own player as well. In previous you could choose what angle to follow the replay, no more of that here.
If you play your career, your opponents score is jumping wildly. Like +3 on leaderboard and -4 during replays. You get comments like ""All over the rough, saving par"" (from 100+ yds out) and pn the leaderboard you're never sure what happens.
And you get to choose your sponsor from offers, its just that they spam you with offers after every finished tournament and you cant turn it off.

Sorry 2K, with this game you messed up badly and given worst edition of your series to date. Nothing changed since this review was posted.

1) You're forced to watch cutscenes the entire time you play.  If you decide to not do rivalries in an attempt not to watch the AI play their shots, it will show you shots from random AI players on the course.  You can 'Skip' these, but the game takes anywhere from 5-10 seconds to load each one so you have to sit for an extra 30 seconds every hole just because the game wants to stroke it's own ego.

2)  There isn't a way to just play a hole you want to play.  You can never redo a shot/practice, you can never say ""i want to play hole 5 on course X"".

3)  The commentators are often wrong.  I turned them off because they are annoying.

4) The game lags and stutters mid-swing, often causing your shots to go awry.

5) When setting up your swing with the three button attempt, there is no way to abort once you've started your backswing.  This is stupid - If I have a poor backswing in real life, I can simply choose not to swing downward and start over. Nope, not here. You're committed, so if you accidentally start your swing you are forced to watch your player muck up his tee shot without a way to stop it.


It could have been a decent golf simulator if it wasn't hung up on trying to be a game where you're ""watching"" the PGA Tour as you play.  I supposed they warned me with the title, but I didn't think I'd literally be watching TV when playing a video game.  I just assumed they sponsored the game.  Although it's not an awful game, I wouldn't recommend it.  I finally rage-quitted after a mid-swing performance stutter during a tourney that ruined my nice birdie streak.

To start the game has a ton of issues. Constant stutters while playing on high graphics settings @ 1080p (4070ti 64gb DDR5 i5 13600k stock speeds) and adjusting the settings doesn't really help much. Graphically the game DOES look a bit better than 2K21 however it's far more clunky. The UI is horrendous in my opinion and lacks simplicity. If it ain't broke make sure you break it I guess. The stutters and hitching is by far the worst as it can/will happen during your swing and absolutely ruin your swing timing. 

The perk system is a rather strange thing to add and I don't really understand why it's even in the game to begin with. I get the idea behind forming your golfer over time as a ""training"" sort of system but it's honestly I didn't expect it nor care for it as the perks need to be activated i.e. swinging poorly X amount of times.

The customization is absolutely awful - major lack of clothing choices, selecting different club designs is a UI nightmare, and there's not much simplicity to it overall. They push things in the shop to buy for character customization but 2K21 had SO many options that were free. 

Club fittings is a relatively neat feature that I don't personally have many issues with. You are given the ability to swap out different grips and shafts on all of your clubs that offer different effects such as shot shaping bonuses or timing bonuses - as with the balls. I feel with the ball fittings it should really mimic how the ball performs in real life as opposed to using a Titleist v1 and adding different ball perks to it such as additional bounce or whatever. 

Clubs in this game do not matter. What I mean by that is in 2K21 different club brands and their types of clubs all worked differently whereas in this title the club brand is literally just a cosmetic feature and nothing else. A Taylormade SIM 2 iron will hit the exact same as a Calloway Apex iron unless you have different fittings attached to the club. I get the idea behind giving players to use whatever club brand and model they want without impacting performance however that's not how it worked in the previous title and that's definitely not how it works in real life. 

The swing system in this game is basically the same as 2K21 but the UI I feel is much cleaner - swing meter sits to the back of the golfer as opposed to below. Went back and played 2K21 and struggled adjusting to the UI difference and I'm honestly in love with how the meter is setup in this game. Shot shaping is the same for the most part unless you have different grips, shafts, and heads that can/will impact shot shaping. 

Sponsors are back and they're definitely interesting - depending on how well you do you have the ability to level up the sponsor and get sponsor rewards after rounds depending on your relationship/performance. It's not overly difficult to level them up as long as you're consistently placing well. Occasionally you'll get an item as a reward or you'll get points to use in the shop. 

Along with sponsors you also have the ability to have a rival golfer, which is your playing partner, and beating them will give you some type of reward whether that's an item from their sponsor or currency. It's a neat feature but lacks depth. 

The game has a driving range that features a ton of different things you can do such as chipping areas with different greens so you can actually work on approach game. It also has a Top Golf mode and it's meh - basically just aim for a target and depending on where you land you're awarded X amount of points. It's cool the first time but after you've done it once you've done it a million times. 

Custom courses are back and it's by far my favorite feature in these titles because you have the ability to play really well made custom courses or troll courses and adds a ton of play time - or you can just play the professional courses over and over. 

Overall it's difficult to recommend this title to anyone if they already own 2K21. You aren't really missing out on much and honestly I'd say 2K21 is a far more polished title in comparison aside the UI in game. I'll continue to play the game as I play when I don't have friends online to play other titles and it's a relatively relaxing game however the issues within this title specifically are rather annoying and abundant. If it's on sale I'd say it's worth picking up but as every 2K title not much changes while they're still charging the full price (lol).",1690071950,1690071950,False,34,0,0.758687317371368408,0,True,False,False

In many ways I do, but I would only give it a 3 out of 5 and I would only recommend it if you know what you're getting going in.  The playability is decent and can be as challenging or as easy as you want to set it.  It does feel much like the golf games I remember playing in the 90's and early 2000's.  The graphics are remarkable, although I guess I'm comparing them to those older games too, so why wouldn't they be?

What I don't like about this game is the virtual money.  It's useless and hard to attain.  You need VC to buy apparrel and equipment, as well as to upgrade your equipment and skills.  Unfortunately, while you earn money by performing well on tour, that money is just an earnings stat that you don't even realize is a thing unless you go looking at your stats and see that you have made $3 million in tournament prizes.  That money means absolutely nothing in the game.

The Virtual Currency comes on some unknown weird algorithm.  Some tournaments I came in 20th and got $700 in VC, while some tournaments I actually won and got $50.  $50 is pretty much nothing at the pro shop.  Clubs are upwards of $500-$1000 just for irons.  Shirts and pants cost $500-$700.  You can win ""fittings"" in tournaments, but to use them you have to spend money.  That costs $50-$125 per club.  I went on a streak and got my earnings up to around $1600, but spent most of that quickly on some fittings that I'd earned.  The game is still fun now, but I can't upgrade in any logical sense and I don't even know how it happens, so I can see this getting boring pretty quick. 

As far as upgrading equipment, that's another annoying feature.  When you're given clubs or you look/buy them in the pro shop, you have no idea how a new item compares to what you already have in your bag.  So, it's probably better, but you really don't know by how much or if it really is.  It's just a mystery.  Same thing for the sponsorships.  Maybe they mean something, but who knows.  You just get offered a sponsorship and if you take it, you end another sponsorship you already had.  You have no idea if its a better deal or not because there are no financial numbers or any other way to judge the sponsor.  I have read just to take every one that's offered and thats what I do, but its just button clicking... I have no idea what sponsors I have, nor do I care after only about 30 hours of play.

So, this game is a solid...meh.  It appears it's just following the new money grab philosophy that is gaming today.  Buy the game for $40-$100 and then if you really want to enjoy it... pay another $50 a month.  Maybe new gamers enjoy this, but I absolutely do not.  I get it, I'm a dinosaur.  However, in my day (kiddies)... you bought the game and got to use every feature if you were good enough.  Then you'd just buy the new edition next year or the year after.  They made their money through new content and new editions.  Now they're just getting greedy.

IDK what they wanted to achieve but they have totally screwed it up now. The frames jump, there is lag and the putting, which was marginal before, has become a big large P O S. The ball has no break on a downhill incline to the left  so your putt will always end up above and past the hole. So on the next shot, if you aim let's say a foot toward the left, the ball STILL ends up again BELOW the hole.

What happened?? You had such an awesome game and now you are no better than those guys over at EA SPORTS!! I am so sorry that there is no decent golf game out there now that you put this patch in!!

Overall the gameplay is solid with a few quirks but after a little adjustment time you can easily figure out the routine. My major gripes are with the packaging and the infiltration of MTX into every aspect of this game.

The player model customization options are fine but that's basically a bare minimum nowadays. The clothing customization options you get out of the gate are absolutely laughable. One shirt, one pair of pants, glasses, like 5 belts, one set of shoes, and no option to customize colors.

The club skins as you slowly unlock them are entirely cosmetic. There are no stat bonuses for the club sets you unlock. The only way to make your clubs better are to equip grip, shaft, and clubhead modifiers that are given out in a loot-box style random fashion. Balls are the same way but even worse because they have limited uses. Found a ball type modifier that suits your playstyle and helps you get low? Oh no, better hope you have the currency to refill it. On one hand I understand not wanting to piss off the club/ball manufacturers by saying ""X clubs are a 93, Y clubs are a 98"" but it would be so much nicer to be able to just drop points into your stats than the current modifier system as it is.

The in-game currency is dished out incredibly slowly. Got a new modifier you just won for winning a tournament at TPC Scottsdale? Oh well, guess you better grind out another tournament to be able to equip it to all of your irons. 

There is not a real store. There are seasonal items, weekly items, and daily items. Plan on kitting yourself out with your dream bag? Want to make your character wear crazy clothes while demolishing the competition? Sorry, you better check in every few months to just HOPE your dream club or outfit is in the lineup and you have the currency to buy it. 

A fair number of the unlockables are progress gated which is fine I suppose but XP is insanely slow and grindy in an attempt to make you drop the cash for a season pass for a 30% boost + 20 free levels of the season pass unlocks.

I was sadly let down by this game. While the mechanics and graphics are only slightly an improvement over 2k21, the rest seems to be worse. 
It took me hours to figure out how to customize my character. It was very much easier to find and adjust in 2k21.  Matter of fact, the way the menus worked in 2k21 were much easier to go through.
The commentary seems recycled from the previous games, and less varied. Finally a female commentator, but she seems monotone, boring and kind of fake at times, like an after thought.
And for the amount of money we had to shell out to play this game.. how dare you add micro transactions? For that amount of money we should have access to all the goodies instead of having to pay for more cosmetic things. I do not enjoy the idea of having to buy premium or premium plus to access more courses, etc.
While the game plays very smooth, i noticed that on the greens, a putt that should've gone in for some reason stops short or just misses, which did not happen in 2k21. Or sometimes when teeing off, a perfectly hit ball suddenly goes awry and ends up in the rough. 

On a positive note, i did not experience any lag, bugs or anything so far, and it seems to run very smoothly in ultra settings on my older inferior pc. 
I'm neutral on the addition of having caddies now. It's a nice touch and makes it more realistic. Coming from so many versions where there were no caddies, i'm just not used to it. It is growing on me though as i keep playing.
Another thing i like is the character's reaction to the shots you make. Easily my favorite feature of this game.

Having said all that, I am not having as much fun as i had with 2k21 so far. I'll keep playing and see if it improves. But i'll definitely be going back to 2k21.

What good is a franchise style mode if it is boring before the end of the first season?

Bugs are also very annoying. Stuttering and frame rate losses during the swinging process and 2K servers and updates have even broken the game for several days making it unplayable.

Then when you open the game, it freezes for about 5 seconds while loading an advertisement every single time. The career mode is moderately fun, but it harasses you to challenge people to rivalries, and then if you accept to make the game stop bothering you about it, it spends the entire tournament comparing you one random player instead of the rest of the field, while making up nonsense about how I apparently was shit-talking them all week on social media. The game doesn't include about half of the courses on the PGA tour, including all the famous ones that you probably want to play on. Every time you finish a round well, you're forced to wait about 2 seconds for an email to load from some company who wants to sponsor you, then when you tell them to bugger off, the game freezes for another 2 seconds to load another sponsorship offer, and so on. I literally have to sit there for 10 seconds declining sponsorship offers after every tournament. The commentary is okay for about two rounds until it gets repetitive, and they often describe the wrong hole (ie warning me about a stream on a hole with no water).

But the biggest issue with the game is it lagging in the middle of a swing, I'm playing on a good machine, but every now and again the game freezes for a fraction of a second during a very sensitively-timed swing mechanic, which often results in my shanking the ball way off, resulting in a double bogey or worse.

There are so many different peripherals out there from laptops to mouse to gamepads etc.  Everything is on-point with difficulty, but then swing timing comes along and shots are going anywhere from 50 yards to 330 yards with a driver!  It's beyond unrealistic on some peripherals, when you think about your standard miss in real life being 50-80% your normal swing power.

The thing is, I want swing timing - I just want to able to tune it to be appropriate for my setup.

As such, I can't recommend this game unless you have the right computer setup.

Edit after 11 hours more gameplay and a lot of googling: You can make it somewhat better by setting mouse sensitivity to an extreme (0 or 100), focusing your entire set-up on transition bonuses, and then 'gaming' the swing calibration by doing stupidly fast or slow swings.  Then only 1 in 10 driver shots goes 50 yards.  It's still a bad feeling though, as I can't use the other archetypes or player builds.

The multiplayer is super frustrating.  I'm Bogey II (super low skilled) and keep getting paired with players who don't have a rating, as the rating resets each season.  These players then go on to score perfect rounds, meaning that we only play 5 holes and they absolutely wipe the floor with me.  

I wish the game could just make unrated players compete at birdie level or higher so that bogey players could actually enjoy the game with other bogey players.

This is a reskin of 2K21.

Sure there are added elements, such as archetypes, stats, and a few others, but the core of the game is essentially just 2K21. It also feels as though the swing mechanics are just enough different from 2K21 to screw you up if you played 2K21, without any reference of the changes. It just feels like a money grab (like most sports games are now).

I'd suggest you try it if you're on the fence like I was and refund it if you're not a fan.

UPDATE after 12 hours:

I decided to pick up 2K23 again as it does scratch an itch for me.

Most of my previous comments still stand, but I'm honestly surprised with the number of ways 2K has been able to ""monetize"" the game. Again, coming from a perspective of 2K21, the cusomization is so much worse than before, maybe 1/4th the number of clothing options. Granted this is not a huge deal, but I do like to set my appearance for each round which is actually difficult to do. I still feel like the swing mechanics have changed for the worse. I was a +19/20 handicap in 2K21 and I can't even surpass +14 WITHOUT swing timing. The inconsistency with wind, stance penalty, and actually hitting the ball within the swing zone is awful. I'm not sure if they need a flat deadzone for all control inputs, or review consistency of inputs, but this is far worse than 2K21's input (which I also complained about and they seemed to have identified/fixed).",1677437498,1686627184,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Match commentary is absolutely atrocious.  By the 5th game or so I muted it because they basically just repeat themselves over and over again until you want to hit your head against a wall.

I feel like I have far more control over my swing in PGA 2K23, but it is far too easy to break the game using Swing Calibration and there is inexplicably no easy way to reset it. The wind and slopes on the greens behave erratically as well. 7 mph on one hole may not affect your shot at all, but will carry your ball way off course on the next. 

MyCareer is a miserable experience. Progression is frustratingly slow and in-game currency is far too difficult to come by. I'm sure this is to encourage players to spend additional money to beef up their player similar to what we've seen with 2K's predatory NBA games.

download monopoly on your phone or PC. the game and computers play more fair than this dumb fucking game

sat there in an online game waiting several minutes for the other player. I guess, there's no timer? dumb as shit. Same game, I spent over 5 shots getting out of a bunker because hurr durr the online mode is fucking dumb as shit.

I'm pretty sure real life greens don't have the physics of ice and i can swing at the same tempo but the game reads it differently every time. It also registers as a hook at the top of my swing as if i'm swiveling the stick at the very end of the down swing, but i'm actually pinning the thumb stick. It reads just fine everywhere else..

To be clear. When you need extra run out of green due to its slope, you don't get it. when you draw back your putt or chip 70% to avoid running off the green, the game fucks you in the ass. When judging tempo on the swing stick (that feature that it starts you out with but no one uses because they released it as shit as ever) it can take the same tempo and the same swing and place you anywhere it wants. It also limits your swing speed on clubs. Like if your hitting a chip or close ranged wedge, your swing speed is limited which also completely fucks your tempo. I don't know about you, but I can swing at a full speed in real life and come out with a favorable outcome.

Their use of buggy, resource hogging Denuvo protection should (and will for me now) warn everyone away from purchases from Take Two and 2k Games (or any others) that use it.

This title is still unable to reconnect to their network infrastructure after being suspended on a Steam Deck so you are forced to always quit out or do without those features. One work around I found for not being able to exit the program normally on the Steam Deck (it's sits and spins on the main screen when you try) is to force it to run using Proton Experimental.

They seem to have fixed (for now) the ball physics issue I had previously reported in my review in one of the last  two updates but why are we waiting for a fix like that on a game that has been out for so long?

This is a don't buy in my book if only because Denuvo will unexpectedly lock you out of this game because it is unable to determine if you own it. Pretty lame.

[b]Things I like:[/b]
• Online cross-play so that I can play with my dad who is on a console. 

• 3-click swing - It's apparently a bit controversial within the golf game community, but I enjoy the 3-click swing set-up that's available within this game. I don't play online matches outside of friends and family, so it doesn't really matter to me if someone has a different swing set-up than I do. 

• Course selection - There's a number of community-made courses that seem like they could be cool. 

• Can be chill or a more intense experience - Good mix of game modes, difficulties, etc.

• Animations and sound are pretty good.

[b]Things that are so-so:[/b]
• Commentary is ""ok"" - Like most games, it's pretty good for a bit but then gets repetitive. They also like to talk while you're out hitting the ball. I'm sure there's a configuration for them and you can certainly turn down their volume, so this is more of a ""meh"" than a complaint.

• I found the rival system to be lacking. The rival replays (which you can turn off) are annoying. The rewards are a one-time thing and there's not much reason to keep playing against rivals once you get their swag. You get a bit of money, but that's it.

• Sponsor system is a bit lacking too - Mostly as it's not explained very well. You'll get lots of sponsor offers immediately after each event (for clothing, clubs, and balls), and you'll offend a sponsor if you accept them, then switch to someone else and drop the original sponsor. Look at the rewards that each sponsor is offering before accepting. If you're doing well, you'll certainly get more opportunities to sign with a sponsor, so don't fret if you need to turn one down right after an event concludes.

[b]Things that could be better:[/b]
• Character customization is limited.

• Regular reminders of more ways to spend your real money for in-game currency for junk.

• Awkward navigation around the ""not-golfing"" menus and UI (think skill tree, pro shop, locker).

• I haven't played a golf game in a few years and honestly kind of thought that the graphics would have made more improvements by now.

• When playing online with friends there should be a better way to keep the party together while changing game modes (you'll get a different room code when switching between course play and Top Golf and everyone has to leave/re-join). No one can arrive late and get into the room if a match is underway (would be nice if they could just take a nominal score on any holes they missed). If someone loses connection, that's it - they can't re-join with the previous room code.

[b]Some gripes that probably just come down to me needing more practice:[/b]
• Take this one with a grain of salt as I'm not a real golfer, but I do understand the basic idea behind low arc clubs/shots having more roll, while wedges/irons will have a higher arc and less roll. Also, I know that the contours of the terrain will impact the bounce/roll, but some times the ball mechanics seem a bit off while it's rolling along.

• Along those same lines - I know putting is challenging and I'll get better with practice, but I suck at reading the greens in this game. But I feel like not consistently...sometimes I feel I've got it dialed in, then the next round I'm way off on calibrating my left-right rotation to correspond to the grid lines.",1684990084,1685482307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a true ""casual"" golf gamer, which should not disqualify my take on this game, since I have also never driven in Indy, gone to war, nor played in the NFL, but am still allowed to have my opinion on those genres of games.  Another caveat - I purchased PGA 2K21 and played hundreds of hours and LOVED it.  I bought 2K23 thinking there would be new courses and new tweaks that would reinvigorate my fun for this game and this franchise.  nothing could be further from the truth.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is that they finally got rid of the ""stutter"" in gameplay that plagued 2K21.  As for the rest?  Where do i begin?

Let's start with the layout of the menu...so dissimilar from 2K21 that if it were not for the 2 announcers, who were in 2K21, i would have thought that this game was made by some other developer.  Why do programmers always assume that they have to completely change what works?  They are so afraid that others will say that this is last year's game with a new title if they don't completely re-build it from the ground up, which is just lazy.  No game is perfect, and you can take the opportunity to fix what didn't work from last year's game, add some new things, and make this a fresh approach without completely ruining the last version.

Which leads me to my next gripe...As a rank amateur, who has no idea what clubs do what, I have to have the info on each club displayed - their driving distance, how far the ball will travel after landing, etc...in order to play this game.  2K21 was so informative that i was able to rank first on several tournaments, and could turn up the strength of the competition as I got better to make it more challenging.  This one?  out of the box, they took away the ""carry"" info for each club (or changed the wording - I wasn't sure, as I was unable to locate it until making several settings changes).  I contacted 2K on their site, and they REFUSED to help me, and told me to ask others on the ""community"" board (which is just a bunch of players, I think moderated by a few 2K techs).   I replied, ""hey - this is the game YOU made, and YOU can't answer simple questions about the program???  To which they replied - nope!  I finally got my answer on the board, after several unrelated answers and comments.

Next gripe?  2K21 was very clear with making changes to equipment and clothes/accessories, how to do so, and what the differences and costs were.  2K23 has so over-complicated the process for updating and upgrading equipment, I have no idea if i just made my equipment better or worse.  Plus, there are so many changes that can be made, i feel like I'm playing a franchise simulator rather than a sports game...it takes a LONG time to make those changes, and you have to hunt for what's available.  Plus, my player avatar is male, yet all of the clothes and accessories are for females - huh????

Now, for the deal-breaker:  2K has decided that playing this game should be as complicated and frustrating as i hear it is in real life.  In 2K21, i got my swing and timing down to the point that I could place the ball pretty close to where I was trying to.  2K23?  Not so much.  Even with the same swing timing, I never get the same swing twice.  The same timing that has the shot go straight this swing is a nasty slice on the next, followed by a god-awful hook on the next.  Plus, when you hook or slice, the ball travels way off-line.  Yet, when you hit it in the ""perfect"" zone...it still goes way off-line.  WTH?!?!?  This game reminds me of those racing games where, no matter how well you drove, the NPC's always catch up because of the ""rubberband"" affect the programmers built in to keep the game ""interesting and competitive.""  Except it doesn't - that's lazy programming that keeps you from being able to master and then level up.

I've seen enough of this hot mess that I am going back to 2K21 and will delete 2K23 to open up hard drive space for a good game.  I HIGHLY recommend that you DON""T purchase this game, unless you love being frustrated for no other reason than just because.  I'm just thankful that I waited for it to go on sale for $20, so that I was not flushing $60 or $70 down the toilet.",1685381061,1685381061,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

If you're wanting some of that old EA PGA style, this is close enough on first viewing but with a closer inspection, you'll likely find it to be lacking somewhat. 

First the good: It's a solid golf game with options for control setups to allow those who like to flick and those that prefer twitchy buttons instead. It's also got a nice selection of courses and the commentary is pretty decent (but gets repetitive). It seems stable, hasn't crashed once and it's a fun diversion for a short period of time.

Now let's head into the rough - The main issue is a lack of depth or replayability. The customisation options are very limited compared to EA's flagship titles and each item of apparel and equipment costs large amounts so you'll likely have to play several 18 hole courses just to grab yourself a new shirt. 

You'll earn XP as you go which can be used to slowly add incremental stat increases but, again, these are kept out of reach so a long grind through  the same courses over and over is required to gain them. 
There's several real-world competitors (or 'rivals as the game calls them) including Tiger Woods but not that many and you'll likely see yourself facing off against the same names within a few days of play. 
The requirement to be 'online' at all times is completely puzzling and is likely there to stop piracy rather than add any kind of depth to your experience.

It is a golf game...  Like many others before it.  But, cross-play?  Yes.  And, it runs pretty well?  Yes.

Now, for the nitty gritty...  Graphically, I would expect a bit more from a game released in 2023.  Character models and foliage are still not very detailed, looking like they are a few generations back from current models.  Otherwise, graphically, it is okay.  Game-play is fun for the most part but there are some definite issues with realism on and near the greens as well as miscellaneous other shots around the courses.  Once you are playing on legend (even on master), greens become almost unplayable giving inconsistent reads and having the ball roll like it would on the surface of glass.  PGA pro greens are fast, but in this game, this is probably 4x as fast as real life conditions when playing on higher difficulties.  The tour championship on legend becomes almost unplayable because of pin placements and green/ball rolling mechanics.  This aspect of the game really needs to be readdressed in order to make the more difficult/realistic modes...  More realistic perhaps?  

The game runs fairly smoothly on even mid range PC's.  But, there are some occasional hiccups that occur while swinging that will cause your swing to register incorrectly.  It is completely random when it occurs, but it does happen a few times a round.

Overall, it is a decent game that I recommend to play online with friends/people.  The only real caveat is...  if you are looking for realism in the difficult modes.  There are other golf games that have done it better.  This one still needs some work, but I have had fun playing it.",1684356750,1684529875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] PGA 2K23 builds upon a solid foundation that 2K21 built. A further fleshed-out career mode, deeper player customization, and a fair amount of core gameplay tweaks makes this worthwhile for new and returning players, while retaining some flaws of the previous game. [/b]

_______________________

I do not know why I love playing golf games. I have a shocking amount of time spent in various Mario Golfs and I played 2K21 for at least a hundred hours. The funny thing? I haven't played golf since I was a kid and I absolutely hate watching it. But for some insane reason I can just sit and play a golf sim for dozens of hours.

As a seasoned vet of 2K21, I really like the tweaks to the gameplay. I [b] LOVE [/b] the change to the putt path assist so it could potentially be inaccurate. The assist was always accurate in 2K21 and made putting braindead easy. With the change, the game provides more of a challenge by making you actually read your lie on the green instead of relying on a perfect guide that just hands you the correct shot to make. The inclusion of 3 tap swing is a godsend. The previous stick based swing could lead to some wonky shots and I could never really nail down the timing in this one, even though I was great at it in 2K21. There is way more control over your shots and the ability to change your ball's (heh) own stats help make taking shots more satisfying and engaging for me personally.

The overhaul of MyCareer (where I spend most of my time) allows you to customize how you play even further. This time around, you can pick an archetype to help guide what kind of player you want. You can switch these whenever you want before a new match, so you're never locked to just one. There's various club fittings to upgrade a club's spin, power, lie, and other tweaks to hone in your strengths while buffing your weaknesses of your chosen archetype. With this change, you no longer have to have a butt ugly driver to have stats that fit your play style, which is pretty neat. One of the biggest critiques I have though, is that it does take in-game currency to put these fittings on clubs. It can stifle progress as the payouts from events can be a little stingy. There is some boosts to payouts through competing objectives, but the fact that I can buy upgrades through microtransactions to progress doesn't sit right with me.

The new character upgrade system lets you pick between various buffs that are activated based on your play. Some are triggered by playing poorly for a stretch while some are activated by playing consistently well. I never really paid any attention to them while in a match bc there's no prompt letting you know one is activated (or at least one that I've noticed), but I could def feel a change as I unlocked more over time. As you progress through MyCareer, sponsors and beating rivals now give you club fittings as well as unique cosmetics; actually serving a purpose instead of just being there as an arbitrary system like in 2K21. They make it worth your while to progress as most of the coolest gear and clothes are through defeating rivals and leveling up your sponsor relationship (including some pretty sick Jordan's). These systems can come off as arbitrary still after a certain amount of time, especially if you're not interested in more Golfer Drip. But maybe you're looking for purchasable swag. Well, you can descend into the treacherous, microtransaction ridden equivelant of walking into the Black Gate of Mordor filled with wack gear for White Guys called The Pro Shop. There can be some gems every so often, but the amount of scratch needed to get them is waaaay more than you'll ever get through playing the game. There is a season pass as well that feels unnecessary bc the free tier is very spare compared to other season passes. The DLC for this game is not really worth it unless you wanna ball on the links as number 23 himself, Micheal Jordan, to complete your Space Jam related golf fantasies.

Audio and visuals are almost exactly the same as 2K21, if not identical. I def recognize some voice lines from before and there's not much changed in presentation otherwise. I'm also a MASSIVE basketball fan, so I'm aware 2K is a habitual offender of More of the Same Syndrome as NBA 2K has kind of been stuck in a rut for the last 5 years (or more depending on who you ask). The game can feel a little...flimsy? It doesn't feel solid, if that makes sense. Madden and 2K also struggle with this issue due to their engines being held together by duct tape, prayers, and triumph of the human will across 3 different console generations. I will say PGA 2K23 isn't as shoddy as the previously mentioned games as it's actually playable for long periods of time, but it still has this very plastic nature to it instead of feeling grounded. The most recent Mario Golf somehow nails that feeling in its gameplay, but most sim games tend to feel like I'm playing with action figures instead of Real People in the Real World.

The overall package of this game is still very much just 2K21 with a few additions to help fill out what was missing. It's part of an overall trend of sports games coming out mostly finished, then labeled as a complete game. 2K23 can sometimes feel a big update rather than a full sequel, but is still a very worthwhile buy if you're a new player or a vet looking for a richer experience than last time round. The gameplay changes do make this worth an upgrade for vets, but if you're still loving 2K21, you can absolutely wait for a sale. There's a solid core here to further improve on, but what we got is still pretty darn good.",1684268958,1684269044,True,7,1,0.606077075004577637,0,True,False,False

I have played thousands of hours of (P.C) golf over the years... heck I even played Mario golf on the Nes back in the day LOL. This game is decent and it's a step towards better golf days ahead - as I felt there were a few years there that were pretty dry on the PC golf game front.

That being said, I DO NOT LIKE MICRO TRANSACTIONS IN MY GAMES. I don't want to look at em' ...I don't want to be reminded every time I boot up the game to go buy this that or the other cosmetic- for REAL MONEY. I'm old school and I remember when you used to buy a full game for full price and that was that - you got what you paid for and weren't being nicked and dimed to death because you wanted a new hat for your golfer etc...

One other thing I don't really get in this game is the sponsorships. They seem a little sloppily implemented. As an example I started my career in amateur mode and made my way into the pros (playing on normal difficulty). I played 8 events on the pro tour and won 7 of them. I came in like 15th place or something on the 9th event and then I get an email from my clubs sponsor ""Ping"" saying I wasn't performing up to specs and they cancelled my sponsorship? SAY WHAT? - if I won 7 out of 8 events in real life, Ping would be showering me with money and beer and women and maybe even some new clubs...BTW PING, I went on to win the 10th event...don't you feel stupid now? I will be having a beer at the clubhouse with my new sponsor ""Cobra"" if you want to come lick my golf shoes in an apologetic fashion...I probably still won't take you back though...

Overall a decent game that can keep you occupied for many hours. I also like the course building aspect of the game as well...it's relaxing.",1684176526,1684183756,True,68,25,0.843957781791687012,0,True,False,False

Amazing:
- Swing mechanics: So incredibly rewarding and accurate, including the timing mechanic. This is the core of the game and they nailed it. When you screw something up, you really feel like you deserved it. When you absolutely smash it, you feel like you deserved it.
- Difficulty levels: Incredibly granular and useful. I mostly play on Pro or Master. 
- Character progression and club fittings: Great mechanic. Can upgrade clubs either by playing online or by playing solo. I do both.
- Competitive ranked modes: Really fun! And surprisingly few people who are outright abusing the game mechanics or cheating etc. I play both solo and 2v2 with friends and honestly it's a blast. Pro is a good difficulty level for online ranked. Personally I think Master should have been used, but Pro is still ok.

Good:
- Graphics: Looks great! But not amazing. Wish there was a bit more variation to some of the courses.
- Course selection: Wish there were some more well-known PGA2K23 official courses, ie. St. Andrews? But course selection is ok. The contribution of user-made courses makes the selection go from ok -> good in my opinion. Being able to play your local courses, even if they're a bit low-effort user-made, is still fun.
- Menu system. Not infuriating, but not great either. You can get around with it. The menu system for room codes/invites is barely passable, but as a whole, it's ok mnk and good on controller. Passing grade.
- Topgolf mode: pretty fun to play every once in a while.


Missing, but would be nice to have:
- Driving range with friends in local lobby.


Bad:
- Despite the great ball physics and swing mechanics for tee/fairway/rough/sand/pitch/chip etc., there is SOMETHING going on with the putting. And no, this is not me just being angry because I suck at putting. But if you also play golf in real life you will realize the putts in this game do not respond the same as in real life. For one, the ball curves WAY too much right off the contact with the putter and does not curve nearly enough at the end of the trajectory. There are also some green surfaces where the result seems very... hmm, wonky. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is just not right with the putting. Hopefully the devs can address this. 
- Kind of sucks you can't choose more pro golfers to play as, seems like you can only play as Tiger Woods, John Cena, and a few other randos. Like what if I want to play as John Daly or Bryson Dechambeau? 
- There's some paid skin crap in the store, but I won't dock them too many points for this.

- My player is complete garbage

- Sponsors are pointless

#Good Graphics (beautiful courses) Really nice looking game

#Golf mechanics are genuinely fun to tinker with especially different difficulty settings. The pro mode is a joke with a mouse though.

Cons: 
#Cross-play?  The game is significantly easier on a controller than using a mouse for swinging. You will not stand a chance against controller users in Pro mode, which is used in ranked online. Let me choose an option to play with someone using the same input method.

The graphics and game play is nice and smooth and has nice scenery and ambient sounds that fall into that relaxing setting of being on a course. Game play is also simple and you can jump right in with a career and get going. 

However, one of the things I really DON'T LIKE is the fact you start off being able to hit 320yd drives with the starter clubs and pretty much hit the perfect shots with ease. You know, the things you build your character up to do later in game? So, basically this game starts you off at end game and you spend money to tweak your character into unrealistic abilities with some flash. It really destroys a lot of that feeling of ""progressing"" when you can birdie every hole right at the launch of the game. I guess the participation trophy era has bled over into gaming as well.

 One thing I can't stand is the fact my character is MALE but the announcers call me ""they"" when talking about my performance. Come on man.... really? I have one personality, I don't need to be called a ""they"". I saw no option to turn this off. Also, I had to turn commentators off as they NEVER SHUT UP. I mean, they ramble on and on and on about a player where it is literally so boring hearing the stories or their opinion that I had to stop and find a way to shut them up. First game I have ever had where they ramble on this much. Just like on TV....they never allow a single second of silence.

 Something else with 2k games is that it takes nearly 2 minutes to exit the game when done. You have to backtrack all the way through the game to the main menu just to quit out of the program. I just shut it down through task manager.

 Animations.....too many scenes with your golfer on a single shot. Sometimes it would be nice to just shoot and move and not have to speed tap through your player reactions to everything.

The level of customization you can put into your golf swing is awesome.  Type of shooter, then you can fit each club 3 ways.. if you get bad fittings you can exchange or combine..  It's great.

Add that with the high amount of hitting customization and you can do whatever you want.  Feels like a golf sim game.  Well flippin done there.

Some negatives
 -(FIXED) Online matchmaker sucks.  Just give me a 3-hole or 9-hole ""quick match"" with ratings.  Start there.
 -Navigating the menu is very clunky, and not direct.  Like somebody lost their keys and can't find them clunky.
 -Why call them Societies?? ""hey bud join my society, we golf""
 -I understand i'm a pro golfer but i don't need 3 ""text messages"" after every round to ask me if i want to sign with ABC company because they've had their eye on me.  Just slows everything down.

Good outweighs the bad 10 fold  - if you want a golf sim-style game.  They crush it.

Instead of griping about the freezes etc, I submitted a ticket to 2k and I was pleasantly surprised that I got basically immediate response.  After diagnosing a few potential issues, game freezes were persisting. However, after finally finishing the Kelley Classic course in the prequal (needing to restart the game after nearly every shot), I have not experienced a single freeze.  It is my opinion that it is this course causing issue and I would recommend changing out that course if possible.  I will update if problems return, but for now the fun is back.

Recommend yes, but needs a patch for the constant crashes / game freeze.  All drivers up to date, still issues.  Tried compatibility settings still crashes after a few shots.     There needs to have a proper patch to fix.  I would avoid buying this at full price.  When it does work it is quite fun, but constantly restarting makes it a pile of crap.

Things that stood out to me from 2k21.
 -Ability to ""level"" up your golfer/choose archetypes to suit your playstyle. For example powerhouse hits further with less control, etc.
 -Ball roll physics are miles better. Ball feels like it rolls more realistically. Approaching green shots really come into play on how you setup your putt, and approach the hole for your last stoke.
 -It has Pebble Beach. Loved this course since I was a kid thanks to Pebble Beach Golf Links on Sega Saturn...I see you Craig Stadler.
 -Three click swing system is pretty dope...which is good because I am pretty sure stick swinging is broken in this game. Enough of a challenge to have to pay attention, but easy enough to keep it fun.
-I can beat Tigers azz.

Things I dont particularly like
 -Riddled with microtransactions for clubs, balls, etc. (Except... I remember I can choose not to like....buy them...so its not that bad.)
 -Golf.....battlepass?
 -Stick swing seems broken....even more broken if you calibrated. Never is consistent, and the slight latency in online matches makes it even more frustrating to use. While 3 click swing is much better, there is also latency for that in online matches as well, but its manageable.

Overall the game isnt too bad...but it isnt amazing either. Would surely wait until it is on sale for like 20 bucks again. Its worth that, but no way in hell is it worth full price.",1682179844,1682179844,True,16,2,0.645654380321502686,0,True,False,False

Online play is fun and fast-paced, and all the modes are fun depending on what mood you're in.

I was a pro at using the swing stick in the EA games, but the 2k swing stick is much more challenging (not necessarily a bad thing). However, again!

Don't care for the shoehorning of ladies major winners. And even if I can live with that, Lydia Ko shooting 62 on a 7800 yard course is optimistic.  The tour events themselves are customizable, can swap some out for other courses, play 1 to 4 rounds, skip events, alter wind, fairway and green firmness and green speed, AI skill and deviation.

As for everything else, who cares? Commentary is bad? I have it off. Music? Off. Micro transactions? Dismissed out of hand. I come for the solo tour season mode and 2K23 delivers just what it should. The skills and fittings mechanics add a touch of a RPG vibe and give you stuff to do between tournaments, but if they weren't a thing that would be fine too. These additions don't move the needle all that much from 2K21 but don't screw it up either and that's fine with me.",1681341129,1681341129,True,13,1,0.629206836223602295,0,True,False,False

1. I will have triple digit numbers in this game & I don't even like golf 
2. I don't play golf never watched golf this game is entertaining and fun. 
3. The ranked play is super fun and makes playing online more exciting when there is something on the line besides like skins but wagers are still fun too.
4.The new 3-click system makes it easier to be good at the game vs the old analog style of ""shooting"" ""driving"" whatever you wanna call it. I enjoy it a lot I like both but I enjoy 3-Click more which analog is still in the game. 
5.Top Golf is super fun to just go hit some balls as it is in real life. Drink a few brewskies with the guys and head to Top Golf virtually is really cool, kind of in some ways reminds me of like Home Run Derby in the Show.
6.I haven't played the career mode although I am sure it is just as fun as everything else in the game. 

I haven't really found anything about this game so far that I didn't enjoy. The graphics look really nice. The character customization is probably the only down fall vs other 2k made games it's lacking in that area but besides that the physics and mechanics of the game seem to be solid the game itself runs smooth on my RTX 3060 R7 3800x I play on max settings around 90fps I can't complain. Oh an you can play as John Cena which is kinda hilarious imo. SO yeah I mean if you like to hit cool golf shots which is my favorite part is going for hole in one and hitting chip shots and just a chill or competitive vibe this game kinda has it all.

But perhaps you were like me, holding off on purchase of the latest golf sim while waiting for that Other Company's highly-hyped (and visually stunning) offering to finally be released? If so -- having initially been taken in by the hype and pre-ordered that Other Product -- I can tell you definitively, it turns out there is quite literally NO COMPETITION at all at this point. Doubly so if you happen to be a PC gamer who prefers keyboard-and-mouse control to using a game controller. 

Within 12 hours of FINALLY getting to try out my pre-order of that Other PGA Tour 2023 product, I was online requesting a refund. As I expect were many other sorely disappointed players, especially those like myself who prefer to play on PC with keyboard and mouse control. 

You can head over to that product's page here to read up on the huge list of inexcusable issues the product has as of its release day -- with no indication from the company that there is even any intention of addressing many of the most egregious omissions (among them the complete lack of any sort of mouse swing mechanic for those of us PC players who prefer not to have to use a controller). Add to that no practice modes, no ability to save a round in progress (you must finish or abandon it), no tutorial, and a confusing UI with an utterly awful, inconsistently-implemented mouse-and-keyboard control scheme -- and the stunning visuals just aren't enough to make up for it. 

In short, 2k23 may not quite approach the photo-realistic quality the ""competition"" were clearly aiming for with their product. But if having an enjoyable, eminently PLAYABLE golf game is your thing, then there really is only one choice.

- The commentators. While I appreciate that they're trying to be gender-neutral, as the game allows for either male or female players, it's pretty obvious that ""they"" is used as a pronoun to refer to players not because it's inclusive but because it was cheaper to only record one set of lines. Even besides that, it only takes a couple hours for the commentators to start repeating themselves to the point where it's irritating. (I do love that the main play-by-play guy sounds like the GEICO gecko, though.) They also often say stuff that's just flat out incorrect, especially where it comes to reporting on your rivalry.

- The in-game replays. Sometimes the game will suggest that something interesting and worth seeing has just happened, either done by you or by your rival, but it'll just zoom in on the golfer's face and never actually show you the shot. How did that make it through QC?

 - MyCareer in general. Maybe I'm spoiled by NBA 2K, but not only is there no story here (honestly, I do appreciate the lack of uncomfortable narrative cutscenes like you get in NBA 2K), but the rivalry and sponsor systems seem an utter afterthought. It's also weird (not bad, just weird) that the game throws in LPGA golfers along with the PGA ones in the MyCareer tournaments and the FedEx cup, and in many cases they finish highly or even win competitions against the PGA golfers. Is the implication that they're shooting off the ladies' tees while the PGA golfers are shooting off the men's tees, or what exactly is happening? They never show it. It's not well fleshed-out, and that's a pretty good summary of this mode as a whole.

- Customization.  Why bother adding such a robust system for clubs and apparel if you're only going to add, like, 15 things in each category (or, in cases like watches and eyewear, like three to five)? Seems a real waste. It's also pretty inexcusable that that selection is further limited by a weekly rotation, and FURTHER inexcusable that there are real-money microtransactions required to get most of these pitiful offerings. The pro shop is a real disappointment.

All in all, this is an enjoyable enough game, but a deeply flawed one.

Game play: 4/5
Is solid and fun but not too deep but an improvement over the last one.

Customization: 2.2/5 for character | 3.7/5 for course editor
very lacking. missing features that allow your character to be unique like weight, bust, Butt/thighs, and muscle tone, having very little hair and makeup options, and a limited store that changes all the time. some of these feature were in previous titles. though the course maker is a little better then the last one.

Online and longevity: an ass rape/5
the game forces you to play online for story mode and more or less you have to be online all the time. this suck as others have said this means that when they shut this one down you will have to move on to the next one no matter how bad it is. and for me some one with poor internet it lags a lot on menus and stuff. they support the game with updates and seasons of content this is not good as it forces them to constantly change the store front making items go away. this also means that you either have to pay for the things you want right away or grind a lot for the items during the time they are available this is called Fear of missing out I as some one with great anxiety this nearly gives me an heart attack just looking at it.

I hope they can add in some of the things I miss/want and let the store amass more items instead of throwing the stuff out for the new shines to allow people to play at their own pace, and for late adopters to have access to the content. along with giving the career mode an offline mode so that people that want to keep playing this one can continue doing just that.

Most of time, in 2K23, the timing for the second and third click feels random at times. Maybe based on what club you're using(?). It just doesn't feels intuitive or consistent, to say the least. Also, the first click is a click and hold for power (the speed of the gauge filling feels random as well(could be wrong)).

I would advise anyone looking at this game to wait for the new EA golf game coming soon. They tend to always get golf games right.",1679547327,1679547327,False,3,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

The 3-click does take some getting used to, and it's not immediately intuitive; they really just needed to take some inspiration from Hot Shots or Mario golf on this with the good old classic shot bar rather than overcomplicating things with the click and hold power, then a second to dial in accuracy and whatever the heck the 3rd click does.    
    
The swing mechanics are good for drives and putts. Chip shots and recovery shots are more difficult than they should be by far, and it likes to shrink the chip shot meter to a size that makes it nearly impossible to click exactly where you'd want. PGA 2k21 had overly difficult putting, this one fixed that for the most part and went with overly difficult chip shots to make up for it. Not the end of the world, but... frustrating at times.     
     
Graphics are good, and were more of an upgrade than I expected from other reviews. I have everything turned up and turned on SSGI, and it looks pretty good and runs perfectly. Player models and animations are good, with the exception of their eyes...they don't look real at all, and the lighting doesn't work with them the way it should. Characters are mostly good, but those eyes will haunt you.    
     
Not a bad pickup for the spring sale price. I'm way more fond of arcade golf than real golf, so I wouldn't pay more than that for this game, but it's fun for what it is since there aren't any Hot Shots/Everybody's Golf games being made these days and they wouldn't be on PC even if they were. The addition of 3 click is very welcome, and it plays fine with a mouse because of its inclusion...still needs a little work, and to simplify the shot so that the difficulty comes from the golf and not from the controls, but it's not bad.    
     
Only major gameplay complaint is that wind has way too much effect on shots. Even a mild 8-9mph wind has a crazy effect on shots, and you find yourself managing ball spin and trying to micromanage every shot because of it, which gets tedious. Add to that the difficulty of the 3-click meter, and it can feel like you're fighting the shot controls more than the course....definitely need to tweak the game settings to enjoy a casual game, but at least it's possible so there's that.     
     
Microtransactions for golf gear are there. I don't know how egregious they are since I have no interest in paying for them; one notable change is that I seem to remember having a bit of clothing choice at character creation in the older versions, but this time you get just the basic default clothes and have to buy anything else. It'd take a few courses to win enough to buy what you want, so it could get grindy down the road. I haven't played enough to say for sure, but this seems less than ideal already.    
    
I'm hoping for something a little better from EA's upcoming game, so if you're spending more than $20 I'd just wait and see how that is. For Steam's sale price, though, sure, this is worth a try.",1679465124,1679465124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only thing that EA has going for them in their newest version is that they did get exclusive rights for the Majors. In 2K23, they have to rename the majors, although, they do have the FedEx Cup.

I was at least expecting the graphics to blow me away but no, they were pretty standard. 

The upgrade system for clubs isn't thought through much by the developer as it is difficult to see exactly what you have equipped and what is better to equip, it's not immediately apparent. You have to hover over each upgrade and check the stats against it, then try to suss out if that is better than what you already have equipped. 

The game will randomly go to your rival player to watch them make a shot but all to often the camera seems to stick on the players face for the whole time, meaning you don't even see the shot. 

The clubs you get for winning events don't have stats against them so you have no idea if equipping them is of any benefit, same with putters and wedges etc. When you are awarded new balls there are some stats attached to them when you are on the rewards screen and you have the option to instantly equip them but if you choose not to, then go to your golfer and the balls section, you are no longer able to see any stats and have no idea if the ball is better or worse than the other balls you have. 

The golfer upgrade system also appears useless. You can spend your hard earned points on choosing, for example, a ""lie boost when playing from heavy rough"". It will say something along the lines of, ""This boost will activate after you have missed the fairway 3 times in a row"", or similar to that effect. As the game is so easy you will almost never miss the fairway and thus never enjoy that particular benefit. There are lots of choices in the golfer upgrade screen but all seem to have similar ideas to the above one.

To watch your own shots in replay mode is also quite difficult, cumbersome and lacking in functionality. Golf games have had excellent replay systems for years where you are able to change various camera positions, free cams and zooms etc so I have no idea why they couldn't just copy something from the past that worked perfectly and instead invent something totally crap.

Your so called ""career"" simply consists of, ""on to the next tournament"" after finishing an average of 18 under for the first half and then dropping to about 14 under overall average after winning the final trophy, on my first and only ever play through. 

Overall it is pretty poor considering people have to pay for it. You'd be better sticking to that free online world golf game if this was the only other choice.

I don't put it past Tiger, not to be knowledgeable in the current state of video game trends. Or recent success'/history of video games today. But I bet that if he knew the story behind cretin Free-to-play game models, he would get where I am coming from.
Not only is free-to-play a revolutionary marketing strategy. Its puts the game in the hands of EVERYONE! There are several free model games where kids get paid 1,000's of $$'s to hit balls with cars and tens-of-Millions of casual monthly players. My point is- If Tiger wanted to introduce the game of golf to the world-and he knew the success of the ""rocket league"" model....this game would be free.

Imagine a populated round of Divot Derbyd...or perhaps a 100 bay round of TopGolf.

One last thought. I fell like we have all been ripped-off at the expense that we love golf and just want the same feeling Tiger has, every time he steps on to the course. If he wants the game of golf to grow(and have more players who want to pay-to-play his real courses), he should feel so inclined as to share that feeling with every player interested in the game. Ya, golfers are rich and the one-time purchase of the game is equivalent to a 9-18 hole round at your local course, but if was available to everyone...

Pros
-Performs well
-Not bad looking
-Fun
-Plays well on steam deck

Cons
-Stick swinging, even when calibrated is incredibly inconsistent.
-Three click is the only way that you can be competitive in ranked play. So if you are a purest, I would avoid all together or wait for the next iterations.
-The graphics, especially the terrain details, feels unbelievably dated.
-You always have to have internet connection for career mode, which is absurd.
-You are not able to download courses that other users have designed to play on the go. Which is kind of a no no with such a thin course list.
-The transactions for clubs and club parts is incredibly predatory because the grind is steep.
-Commentary isn't the best.

After 3 mos. of play My initial analysis is still foremost in my mind.  2K23 has different physical
controls on a controller (PS4).  I have an older 2080 NVidia which shows the courses in great
outdoor contrast.  Park-like settings abound, yet this graphic wonder does nothing for the zombie appearance of the gallery.  The actual game-play offsets this feature as one realizes
that 2K23's gallery coders are not Michelangelo students.  Seems that some of the actual play
with Tiger showed his chest a little feminine in my eyes..wonder if he knew that...?  Perfection 
No but I enjoyed the 1st Fedex game-play.  At $29.99US You get all U need to play.  

Do i recommend this game..yes because I love golf.  Graphics and Game-play warrant 84%.

In addition I would like to submit the following perception.  It is such an honor to listen and have Henni Koyack as a Pro Golf Correspondent.  The perfect inflectional referencing Birdy

1) I was also a 2k21 user too, so I have a good compare between both versions.
2) My PC Specs: Win 10, 32 GB Ram, RTX 2060 (8 GB Ram)

My overall experience with 2k23 has been good so far. The really only reason I upgraded to 2k23 was for the Course Designer improvements. It is true that 2k23 is mostly the same exact version as 2k21, however there has been some improvements. The major changes are:

CHANGES (between 2k21 vs 2k23:
- Cross play/match making- 3 Click swing
- 2 new courses (Pebble Beach, Torre Pines)
- Tiger Woods and a few famous celebrities
- Club/fittings upgrades in game as you play
- Very improved skill system where you choose what skills you want as you earn them
- TopGolf (target practicing/play)
- Graphics improvements
- Course Designer improvements (mostly spline)

PROS
- Looks better, more realistic
- UI redesigned
- Course Designer works much better now
- A few more new players and a couple new courses

CONS
- It does freeze up now and then
- Even though graphics quality is better, its also a little to dark visually
- Course Designer could still use some new designer features
- No mini Golf assets
- Still NO major courses yet

COMMUNITY SUPPORT
- There are tons of videos/tutorials on YouTube for both play and designer
- They also have a discord server, but that do restrict what you can post. I have had a few suggestions deleted. And they were not weird.
- There is also Steam community, but its a hit or miss if you get responded too

WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Add Major courses
- Ability to delete our created Courses from the Server
- Better Course Designer tools for copy/editing splines and objects
- More objects/props for traditional mini-golf (barriers/rails, Lighthouses etc)
- Fix freezing and crashing issues
- A setting to adjust brightness/contrast etc.
- A simple two-click swing meter for disabled people

MY OBSERVATIONS

As far as gameplay, the only thing I really notice is that my shots are not as good as before. It is a lot more sensitive. In 2k21, if I was off I didn't get a whole lot of adverse effect. But, in 2k23, if I am off there is a noticeable difference, which make the game slightly harder. Which is fine by me because I thought 2k21 was to easy on Beginners mode, (And Yes, I know its even harder on Pro mode)

Some reviewers claim that 2k23 is play-to-win. I don't think that is accurate. If you are wanting to, you can pay real money to get equipment/apparel much quicker. But, you have two choices on ""buying screen"". You can also pay for things using in-coin currency and not pay using real money. It just takes some progression to get enough in-coin funds to buy things. Or, if you are impatient, you can pay money to get it quicker. That is NOT play-to-win, its pay-to-get things quicker.

I mainly upgraded to 2k23 for the course designer. With the improvement of the Spline tool I find it much easier to make fairways, green etc. However, I still feel the designer lacks some quality tools for copying objects easier using splines for some objects that currently don't have the ability. I also know many people create min-golf courses. However, 2k23 is not made for that and it shows. If you want  true mini-golf you need to restrict the player to just using the putter (which you can't do now). Also, there are no barriers/rails that are very low to the ground. And using a spline to move everything up/down is a pain because you can;t see the objects as you move them. Since people want to design mini-golf, they should provide more realistic min-golf props that are used in real life (windmills etc), Over all, the designer could use a lot more improvements.

One thing that I wish for is a way to import OBJ files. Also, I would like to see a few blank signs of various sizes AND a 3D Text Object that I can edit text using my own fonts,color,  alignment etc. This way I can add text to a blank sign.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, I think the upgrade has been good. However, the crashing was NOT there in 2k21, so that is a bummer. But, the UI, graphic quality, skills and designer improvements are good. 

If you don't need the designer or money is tight, I would hold off on purchasing at full price and wait for a sale. 2k23 is only slightly better than 2k21, Especially if you consider the courses are the same. BUT, if you need the designer, I would recommend upgrading, but I would still wait for a sale, like I did.",1677591120,1677593260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This one has the addition of being able to play as PGA Tour players such as Justin Thomas, Tony Finau and of course, Tiger Woods.

The My Career mode is once again the main focus, with players starting out on the lower tours working their way up to make it on the PGA Tour, challenging rivals, and earning sponsors along the way. Unlike PGA Tour 2K21 however, is that the various clubs/equipment no longer have different stats. Instead the way to improve your player is to up their various ""stats"" related to their play on the course. These could be an increase in swing timing when driving the ball, an increase in shot power when chipping, etc. This adds some variety to what made PGA2K21 a little stale after playing it for awhile. Once you had unlocked the driver with the furthest distance there was no reason to not use it, but here you are free to choose the clubs you want and also improve your stats regardless of what you have in your bag.

I have no idea what the review talking about micro-transactions is referring to. Yes, you can purchase in-game currency with real money...if you want to? But the game in no way makes you do this. The person even says it's pay to win, but I don't see how when they even admit that cosmetics do not impact your skill attributes. The currency only goes towards purchasing cosmetics. Ultimately, the game lets you earn it for free anyway. I'm not even really that great at the game but I have no issue with earning enough currency to slowly upgrade my gear/clothing.

Pros:
- Game seems somewhat more optimized compared to 2k21. I could never run 21 at more than High, this I can run at Ultra while maintaining 60fps
- Adding real pros into the mix definitely helps with the overal ""atmosphere"" to things.
- Very slightly improved graphics overal
- Better player animations - celebrations feel more natural and look less stilted compared to 2k21

Cons:
- I feel like the player character is a downgrade from 2k21. Fewer options to tweak in terms of facial and body structure leads to some fairly ""generic"" looking characters.

It feels like corners have been cut at every corner and 2k/HB Studios have pushed out a half arsed game because at the time of development, if you wanted to play a golf game the only choice you had was this one.
[list]
[*]The commentary and production is some of the worst I've ever heard in a sports game. Their is very little of it, and within an hour of playing you'll be hearing the same commentary over and over again. The commentary is also very inacurate at times, you can hit your ball into deep rough and they'll say ""oh he'll like the look of this lie"". The production is very poor as well, with replays often choosing to focus on your players face instead of the ball, and taking far too long to load to the point where I disabled them.
[*]If you hit a ball into a spectator it just phases through them, EA Tiger Words 2009 had spectator physics, how a 2022 game doesn't is beyond me. 
[*]On lots of occasions if your ball is lying infront of a tree, or seating stand or any other object, you can't actually see your golfer taking the swing (all you see is the tree/stand/object)
[*]If your ball ends up in the bunker you can't see the lie grid below your feet because it's the same colour as the bunker
[*]There are too few shot types, many times you will end up stuck under a low branch and can't properly get the ball out due to the lack of shot types
[*]The tutorial does nothing to help you understand swing timing, which is a very critical concept to the game and took me the best part of 25ish hours to actually get the hang of, and this was after spending hours on youtube watching videos explaining it.
[*]The game is missing several iconic courses, namely Augusta and St Andrew's. The courses you will be playing in career mode get very repetitive as you see the same courses over and over again
[*]The my career mode is very shallow. You have a set of rivals, but once you beat them all (can easily be done within 1 season) you just redo them, but without any rewards. Completely pointless and no incentive to keep doing rivalries once you beat each golfer once. 
[*]Devs are unresponsive to player feedback. A Q&A was down on the official discord sever, and the answers were nothing but 'keep your eyes peeled'. Wouldn't tell us anything useful.
[*]Online modes are buggy and reasonably unpopulated. 
[*]Menu is very clunky and slow to do anything. It feels like anytime you open a different part of the menu it's sending a request to a server to allow you to do so.
[/list]

TLDR this game is unpolished, and feels very half baked. I would personally wait for EA PGA Tour which comes out in a couple of months and then evaluate which of the games is better.

from researching on various froums it appears there is a way to move your profile from PC to steamdeck so all of your fittings appear HOWEVER when i search around those posts are often removed, making me think that 2k does not want people to know how to do this so they could then transfer fittings between each other as they file share,  if anyone can hook me up with what file needs to be moved where so i can take care of this on steamdeck that would be awesome.

I did an extensive review for 2k21 when it first came out and though there was a ton of buggy nonsense in 2k21, it was fun, and a breath of fresh air to have a competent golf game with decent ball physics.

I bought 2k23 immediately at launched and had some fun with the tournaments, but generally, this feels like the same game. I haven't touched it in weeks, as it really just gives off a vibe of ""why am I even playing this?"". 

I cannot comment on the gamepass or whatever it's called. I laughed at the idea of purchasing that and barely even skimmed its offerings. As for the club/ball upgrades, it's annoying to look at, and so I mostly ignored that too. Didn't want to be bothered.

Bottom line here is this. We had hope whe 2k21 hit that golf fans would finally get somethig good to play. Now that EA has re-entered the scene, well, you saw the previews for the EA game.  The 2k series is dead in the water. Don't even bother unless there's a massive sale, and you simply CANNOT wait for the new one coming out from EA.

EA is a mess lately, but what they previewed is miles ahead of this. Even if that game fails it'll be a better investment than dropping 60 ucks on this.

Standard balls shoot thru the greens like Curry through a White dude's colon, but don't worry, they'll sell you real balls. 

Break on greens just randomly changes. For example, you may take a putt that shows 3 lines of break to the right, miss, and when you go to take the putt back the other way, the break where you were just putting has changed or is completely gone.  

Chipping is so touchy that the animation for your club head coming back doesn't have time to play, making soft chipping on Master difficulty basically a crap shoot. Just close your eyes and do it, the game is giving you zero information to help anyway.

I'll play a hole with a very similar layout, wind speed, and fairway dimensions to another I played- first hole, hit a straight driver with 100%, the line is straight throughout the meter, it goes straight and lands in the fairway.  Next hole with similar items mentioned, hit the exact same shot- tempo, accuracy, power- it pulls and goes 15 yards into the rough.  I get that as in real golf there are nuances that cause these differences, but the game isn't showing me that.  Also there appear to be vastly different rollouts given similar green conditions and clubs.  9 iron on one hole with similar conditions/flat green rolls one distance, another hole with similar conditions rolls out much further.  I'm not seeing based on the meter what caused it.  Maybe I'm missing something, but it's just not clear. 

Also it appears to ""rig"" things in order to keep your score reasonable- birdie one hole, then next hole seems to artificially produce a bogey by making the shots do different things.  Just seems that way.  AI seems to play into it as well- I birdie a hole, the leader seems to birdie the hole they just played.  Even on normal opponent difficulty I never see a player come down with a double bogey, it's always either pars or birdies.

The lie does the opposite of what you expect it do- in deep rough, in real golf I should have to take a harder swing to get it to go the same distance as a fairway lie.  But in deep rough I always have to dial down the power to get the same distance as a fairway lie.  That tells me the game isn't calculating the distance properly based on the lie.

Mostly positive. A noticeable, but not overwhelming upgrade on previous versions.

POSITIVES
The new position of the ""swingmeter"" is a masterstroke - you are now watching the player rather than the bottom of the screen. And, overall, the screen look a lot less cluttered.

Ball physics is distinctly different. Lofted shots tend to ""stick"" more while putts run on and/or break much more. Takes quite a bit of getting used to but IMHO a definite, if challenging, improvement.

Overall gameplay seems smoother

Graphics seem a modest upgrade on 2K21. The players stances seem more realistic and the scenery (especially the trees!) are much more lifelike.

NEGATIVES
Biggest negative of all - the ever increasing pushing toward paid add-ons!!! 2K21 was bad enough but this edition takes it to new levels of mendacity. At least 2K21 still had a small but reasonable number of free add-ons. 2K23 has virtually none as far as I can see. Everything has to be ""bought"". I realise that ""in-game purchases"" are now a fact of life, and that is understandable for free or budget price games but for a premium price product...??? Even when just logging in to the game you are confronted with screens trying to part you from your hard-earned cash. 

At the moment the relatively small number of ""community"" courses and ""ghost opponents"". But, of course, as a new game this is to be expected. Hopefully in time it will rival 2K21 and (especially TGC19) for the range of alternatives.

""UNFULFILLED WISHES"" - mostly minor things that I would have liked and were absent in previous iterations.
(Disclaimer: Some may actually be there but I just haven't found them yet)

Ability to search for courses by country.

A means of switching off ""crowds"" by default - I don't wish an audience for my regular humiliations!

Some method of filtering ""ghost"" opponents to within a particular score range - it can be a pain filtering through pages of either ""tyros"" or ""rabbits"" just to try and find a few with round about par performance.

Was luck to purchase it at a small discount in the recent sales. Probably would have been a bit reluctant at the moment to pay full list price but quite satisfied in the product for the price I paid.

Since I haven't played the other 2K parts, I can't make a direct comparison. But I am very excited about the 23 version.

positive:

- good graphics
- many courses
- a lot of setting options for tournaments and individual matches
- career mode
- shape character
- the opportunity to play against other players online or to join a society to compete with other golfers in tournaments
- 3 kick swing (for me the most important thing)

not so good:

- it's a pity if two players play, the camera doesn't switch to the opponent (if you've already holed out yourself)
- the display for height differences is missing (or I haven't found out yet which one it should be or how to read it)
- the career (the tour) cannot be played in pairs

Keep in mind, that my impressions of the game are solely from a single player perspective

In comparing to 2K21, it really is not majorly different. 

Visuals:
-> There is a slightly better atmospheric feel to the game, basically due to lighting changes.
-> Character models - just go ahead and fire that person! How does it take two years to worsen the character models? Congrats - they've accomplished just that.
-> Just name your  player ""Crazy Eyes"" and move on
-> Textures really have not improved; however without the jump to the newest Engines, as most of the current AAA titles have done, they are limited to basically importing 2K21 and adjusting the lighting.
-> Addition of the Caddy is nice, would like to have had some voice over with it and see it a bit more frequently. IE ""Tiger Woods Road to the Masters""

-> Game play feels pretty much the same. 
-> New swing animations are OK, would be nice to be able to chose one for your Character
-> Greens can be lightening ""Phil Michelson Rage stopping"" Open Greens

Monetization:
-> It is in the game. Not pay to win in single player, just more like Pay or Grind over time.
-> This is where games loose me. I want a Simulation...Not and Arcade style game
-> EA's up coming will be the same way, which is why I went ahead and purchased this on sale. EA, ruined Madden with stupid card packs, hopefully this game will not go the same route. However; if there is money to be made, they will.

I have to not recommend this game.  I was not willing to pay full price for it, and I bought the Basic game when I pulled the trigger. If you do not have 2k21, then, I would say get it, but make sure to get it on sale. There really is not 2 years of work here. It is like your date looking slightly better with Makeup, but just slightly.

It's got everything you'd expect in the places you'd expect it, no real surprises, just refinement of what was in 2k21. It's fun, it makes you feel like you're a pro, the concept for rivals is interesting, there's a lot of courses and customizability. That said, almost all of my complaints come from what feels like a lack of polish on basic systems, things that weren't issues in the previous edition. In a practical sense, every round you'll see a number of... not problems, because it won't interrupt your gameplay too badly, but jank would maybe be the best word? Inconsistency? Sometimes the game just will not behave as you expect it to.

The course conditions in general are fine, but the inconsistency is a real pain here. Sometimes for one hole the fairway and green will be extremely fast out of nowhere and a perfect tee shot runs out to 350 and into the rough. Sometimes when you start a round on the easiest weather conditions, you'll end up playing 18 holes in 10-15 mph winds anyway. Sometimes a 2 mph headwind steals 10 yards off your approach, and sometimes it does absolutely nothing and you soar over the back. Sometimes 0 mph winds actually *are* a wind you need to account for. Sometimes the wind direction and speed changes wildly mid-setup, making it impossible to properly account for. Sometimes hitting out of a bunker or the rough will actually eat 60% of the distance, and sometimes it won't take anything out of it at all. My 3 wood for some reason comes up 20 yards short from the listed distance the game gives me even on a perfect lie. Making reads on putts and around the green is a particular challenge as identical looking shots will behave in entirely different ways the moment they touch the surface, sometimes breaking far more dramatically than it would suggest or running ten feet long into an uphill on a chip. It's only happened to me twice, but I've even had it where the putting grid on the green was straight up wrong, and was showing me the direction of the break in reverse.

The inconsistency here can be absolutely maddening at times when it feels like the game just took a shot out of your hands entirely, but despite how it sounds, none of these things have ever cost me more than a single stroke and never pushed me into bogey territory. I want these issues to get patched and dealt with, I want the information the game conveys to me to be correct, but the game is totally playable and enjoyable in spite of it.

Aside from that, there's a lot of little things that can be bothersome but overall aren't that huge of a deal. Highlight cut-ins of your rival are incessant, but also display incorrect scores and play incorrect announcer lines. I'll get a rival highlight that says he's -3 on the 5th hole and the announcer says he's ahead of me, and then it'll go to the leaderboard between holes and he's -5 on the 12th, while I am 14 under on the 12th hole. It's not really a problem though, because you can turn these off in the settings and doing so immediately cuts the time a round takes in half, so you should just do that.

Something else is your own ""nice shot"" highlights. Sometimes it's like the game doesn't know what to do with the camera, so you'll get 22 yard chip ins where the whole highlight is the camera on your golfer's face and you never see the ball, or it'll cut away abruptly right as the ball is about to drop into the hole. When it works properly, you can get some nice looking angles, but I'd really like to see them forgo the PGA coverage imitation and do more to ensure that your cool shots actually make you feel cool when you watch them.

Other people have complained about the microtransactions, and I'm not gonna go over all that again. They really don't need to be here but it's a cash grab move everyone's making. Pay to win, however, it is not. Just playing the game normally, no money spent, no special golf balls, just using whatever stuff I earned from sponsors and rivals, I have lost a grand total of a single round. You absolutely do not and should not spend money on this game thinking that's the key to success, because it's not, and you can absolutely win without any of it.

Rivals and sponsors are a cool idea, but all there is to them is making a selection from a menu and playing golf, plus getting the aforementioned wrong highlights. I really wish there was anything akin to the player interaction moments from an NBA 2k game, not as a whole narrative but maybe just some smack talk on the course, or maybe your rival could issue some of the on-course challenges. Maybe for a par 3 your rival goes, ""Hey I'll bet you 200vc you can't beat my approach shot, clean 1000 for a hole in one"". Something more direct and head to head would have been very welcome here, instead of the more abstract numbers comparison at the end. I mean hell, even actual tournaments sometimes have prize holes for like, hitting a hole in one to win a car and cash, or a longest drive competition on a particular par 5, and that sort of thing is totally absent. Is it a touch more arcade-y? Sure, but not in a way that messes with the mechanics and for a single player mode, that's fine.

I'm putting this as a recommendation, but I wish I could choose 'Mixed' as my answer there. Does it have problems? Yes. Are they that bad? No, not really. Do you have any other decent options for a PGA video game? Also no.",1670034620,1670034620,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]THE BAD[/h1]
- club appearances still reset to default after choosing your preferences.

- constant, weird stuttering online and offline (not a hardware issue, could be the ""always online"" connection needed to play.) these always happen at crucial points of your swing and absolutely ruins shots.

- needs QOL improvements such as inventory management now that useless fittings have to be sold individually. Exchanging/selling fittings could be done better.

- small inventory of apparel, mediocre character customization. Clothing choices are wrapped up in season passes, 

- match making is bad on pc. hard to find games most of the time.

- replays and most camera angles are trash. Good god, there is so much lost potential in the replay functions.

- It's challenging for experienced players, and approachable for new players. The difficulty settings can easily be set for your experience.

The reason it's getting a thumbs down from me is that the small improvements in golf gameplay over 2K21 are negated by the need to constantly be using your earned credits in MyCareer mode to replenish the ball you want to use. The default ball that has unlimited inventory has such terrible stats that it seems like you are putting on ice. You need to pay for the better balls, and one ball is consumed with each round that you play. 

I imagine that once I put in another 30 hours or so, I will have amassed enough of the one that I like that I won't really need to worry about it anymore, and can go back to spending my credits on other gear.

Pros: 
1. Fairly realistic physics for the most part, once you get a hand of the wind management and green angles.
2. Graphics are on 'par' with the last game 2k21, perhaps slightly improved textures. However, I would have expected better in year 2023. Who ever did the modeling for Tiger Woods did a poor job as his player in game looks over exaggerated with color of skin and muscle mass,  Tiger been hitting the gym that much? No don't think so. His trap muscles could give Arnold Schwarzenegger a run for his money.
3. I do like the custom specs that you can 'sculpt' your character, odd that you can jump 4 specs in the same tree, but nice as the early spec is for when you are performing poorly. Who wants to spec into a stat and only have it activate when you perform terribly?

Cons:
1. Still just like in 2k21 the money system is terrible.  I stated in my previous review of 2k21, that if you play x amount of games to finally get to the FedEx cup, you should WIN a decent payout.  I am thinking at least 2k in VC?  That would make sense does it not??  Takes you hours to even get to that title and to finally win the event.... only for the let down of either 250 VC or NO VC at all.....  what a let down.
2. As stated above in my first Con: VC allows for purchase of various items in the game,  so why not allow players to earn their VC through wins more often.  When I win a tournament, I want to feel like I won something instead of pressing the space bar on my keyboard to advance to the next hole?
3. Clubhouse Pass -  I leveled to the top rank for Clubhouse pass.  For some stupid reason, I was thinking that this allowed me special coins each level to put towards certain Clubhouse pass VC,  wow was I wrong.  So what was the point of the Clubhouse Pass VC again?  Oh to level up to be able to ""pay real money""?  Okay... looking at the Clubhouse pass, surely I will see some epic looking loot here.... ummm no I see brown shirts and ugly logos. Who would even consider paying $10 of real money for this 'epic loot'. Oh, I see a ball with a hat? No thanks, not gonna happen.  Now add a green glowing club head and perhaps I will take another look.
4. Multiplayer - where is it? Been playing since day one, and you could drum up a 1v1 or a 2v2 fairly easy the first week.  Now we are about a month out and there is ZERO activity there.  I can leave my player in que for up to 15 min, finally get a person to play with. 2 holes in and they rage quit,  yay me? Start process all over again.  This game is brand new, there should be thousands of people in line to que up against others.  Instead, no leader board nothing.  But this game has voice chat, cool!! Wait.... so I can hear some mouth breathing neck beard burp in my ear with heavy breathing... no thanks again. Perhaps they could add some simple responses that people can click on to either congratulate the player that just got a hole in one, or just say a clickable response with ""nice shot"" or ""good game"" ""you tried your best"" or ""ahh man, bad lie"" etc.
5. Societies -  Had some decent fun with these. You are not forced into a society by any means, but would have been a nice touch to see some sort of people in the game at the same time. Or even a ghost image shot of a ghost player that is at the top of the learder board etc.  Instead, you are left playing by yourself against players that live and breath this game scoring -56 on masters difficulty... okay
6. Henni Koyack for the commentary of PGA 2k23?  Sorry but this is the worse commentary I have EVER heard in a golf game. Terrible delivery, reading from a script and poor delivery.  What were they thinking hiring her for this game? Rich Beem and Luke Elvy do fairly good with their delivery, why not Henni? No need to answer this, we all know why she was hired.

Overall, it sounds like the cons outweigh the pros.  Perhaps they do, but I still enjoy the ambiance sounds (is that a word, hell I don't know but ya sounded good) it is relaxing, the crowd noises sound fairly on point and it feels satisfying still to win on hard mode in terrible playing conditions.  I still recommend the game, but not at full price,  when it gets down to $25 then yes.",1668694389,1668694389,True,11,1,0.653074204921722412,0,True,False,False

I have bought only the base version of this game, yet with less than 100 hours of playtime, I have all of my clubs decked out with legendary fittings, with a bunch more sitting in my inventory in case I want to switch some up, and significantly plenty of VC to spare. Once you reach max level (level 50), every level up from there rewards 250VC which adds up quickly. I've mostly played MyCareer with an occasional round with friends, but I net around 1000-1200xp per round in MyCareer which usually earns a level every 3 rounds (sometimes 2). 

In terms of difficulty, the legendary fittings, as well as the attributes/abilities you spec into make a world of difference. I went from shooting 10 over on pro during my first few rounds with no fittings, low level account, to being able to consistently hit 10 to 14 under on master with full legendary fittings and a level 50 character. In terms of how effective this is online is debatable, as if you're just playing casual, you can play as Tiger Woods who has attributes and clubs that are better than what you can get by just grinding. In societies, you're locked to playing your own character and oftentimes locked to whatever difficulty the hosts sets it up as. (There is a PGA society that is open difficulty, but I believe it is scored and ranked by each player's handicap, instead of just strokeplay)

For people complaining about the amount you'd have to grind to reach where I'm at, I think VC management is key if you want to have 'end-game' clubs (fittings) as early as possible. Here are some tips I'd have for getting clubs and also leveling up as quickly as possible.

For legendary fittings
-Never equip any fitting that isn't legendary, it is going to get replaced by a legendary one eventually, and fitting them would just be a waste of VC, especially if you are a F2P.
-Always trade up your fittings, don't salvage them for VC but instead trade them up all the way to legendary
-Only use legendary fittings that suit your playstyle, any other's that you don't use, trade them for one that you need the most (I am a powerhouse that uses swing path/timing/shaping fittings)
-Do not use Hybrids until end-game. Although I have reached ""end-game"" I still choose not to run any hybrids majority of the time, because not having a hybrid is one less club you need to acquire fittings for, and one less club you'd need to use your levels to apply abilities to. 
-Prioritize where your legendary fittings go. Personally my irons had the most drastic effect for my gameplay, so I would prioritize in this order (Irons > Wedges > Driver > Woods > Putter)

For leveling (MyCareer)
-Gauge where your skill is at and change the difficulty from there. I wouldn't recommend playing below pro but you can customize certain settings to make the game significantly easier. If you can play scratch golf on pro difficulty, then you should be more than fine already. Change the MyCareer AI and Weather Condition difficulty to Very Easy as it does not affect the amount of XP per round. If you'd like you can adjust them accordingly to provide more of a challenge when suitable, which is what I did. If Pro eventually becomes too easy even with Very Hard AI or the scores become to unrealistic for your liking, you can up the difficulty to Master and set the AI difficulty back to Very Easy and work your way back up again.
-Try to play consistent golf, because of how sponsorships work, it is better to play constant scratch golf rather than being a +8 then occasionally having a round over par, as this round will cause you to lose all progress with whatever sponsorship you are currently trying to level up. If anything, if a round is going poorly enough to cause your sponsors to drop you, you are better off withdrawing and forfeiting any rewards rather than resetting your sponsorship progress.
-Always prioritize rivalries that reward you with VC or Club Fittings as you'll be able to use those to work towards legendary fittings
-Always try to aim for 1000-1200xp per round, if you can't reach it, try changing settings in the difficulty to increase the XP multiplier. (The Putt Preview setting decreases your multiplier, but is probably the most effective in making the game significantly easier)",1668349149,1668349149,True,41,3,0.745331764221191406,0,True,False,False

The main issues are:-

1.) Despite being a full priced game, to get any of the decent apparel content, etc. You are expected to fork out more cash for a season pass or expansion pack. After every match, you get ""text messages"" from wannabe sponsors, but non of them give you any decent gear.

2.) Graphics and course decorations are poor. Despite being the new 2023 title, the best looking thing about the game is the trees. Course buildings, and people are like plastic blocks and other ground textures lack any kind of detail.

3.) Quite often, the game will do a cut scene to ""let you watch player xyz's shot"". But the camera will lock on to the players upper half after the swing and not the ball! Making the whole thing a bit pointless.

4.) It crashes, frequently.

5.) Commentary is poor. After just two matches, you will have heard the same small collection of phrases and quips so many times that you'll be looking for the option to turn them off.

The graphics is, as far as I can tell, the same as 2K21, a let down for sure. The game suffers from lagging or ""stuttering"". I've read that alot of players are facing the same problem. The worst thing is that it occurs during backswings and totally destroys your swingpath making the ball land in the neighbouring town. It makes the game unplayable sometimes. On 2K21 I played on the highest settings without even a smudge of lag. From my miniscule amount of testing, it seems as no matter the graphics-setting selected the lag won't stop. I hope they fix this problem soon.

The features are good such as rivals and sponsors. The best feature in my opinion is the way you level up different clubs and the character to hit better or farther in varying conditions. Way better than 2K21 when the better club made you hit the ball further. 

The commentary is just sad. It is 50% of the time the exact same audiofiles as in 2K21 and it is not even done right. I've heard Luke Elvy call Henni Koyack ""Beemer"" (""thats all from Beemer"") about 3000 times. When setting up for par Luke Elvy has said multiple times that ""It is a long putt for birdie, but it still counts"" or whatever. The list goes on. It is a minor flaw but it truly grinds my gears. 

In conclusion, buy it if you've played enough 2K21 to be able to recite all of the voicelines from Rich Beem and you are begging for a fresh start. If you are new to the game, save a few bucks and buy 2K21. 2K23 is not a bad game but it is not worth the 60€.",1667941488,1667941488,False,5,0,0.540709793567657471,0,True,False,False

I want to review the game now, while it's still fresh out of the box for me and give you some insights that may give a better impression of the game than all the negativity.

I've been playing this game since the beginning and have really enjoyed watching the progression. Before that, I played the Jack Nicklaus games that dominated the genre. Every version has seen some improvement in both graphics and gameplay, and the current version is no different.

1 ) Graphics - My first impression was that the game didn't look as clean as 2K21, but I'm realizing there's a good deal more detail that is muddying up the screen. It makes the game look much more realistic. I wish I had a newer computer with a far better graphics card as I'm sure it would look much better than I can currently see.

2 ) Gameplay - When I first bought 2K21 there was a period of adjustment I had to make in my ""swing"" as the ideal tempo changed. I'm very happy to say that with this version, I'm getting predictable results. They have also added mechanics that also affect your shots. You now have the ability to not only change the trajectory height, you can affect the ball spin. In real golf I love hitting an easy flop shot that drops the ball right on the hole, and now in 2K23 I can do that.

In switching from beginner mode to pro-am, I'm noticing that even the slightest errors in my swing affected my shot. I am happy to say, that at this setting a huge miss in my swing does not make my shot catostrophic, such as hitting the ball onto  the wrong fairway! How did I do? I was +9 after 18, but the back nine I played far better and by the end, I felt like I had the kind of control I had in 2K21.

I am noticing that the terrain affects shots more realistically, not only on the fairways and rough, but certainly on the green. It used to be that a 15' putt without a break was a gimme, but not so much now. Even your easy putts need to be taken seriously and your drives must take slopes into consideration much more. Every shot just feels more realistic.

3 ) Online competition - In fairness, I haven't tried this yet. I would just like to point out that playing games online has forever been plagued with shoddy performance, server lag, rubberbanding, data loss, etc. Some of this a game developer can minimize and some it just can't. When I think of all the subtle mechanics going on in my split second swing, that's a hell of a lot of data needing to be transmitted over the internet. Here's to hoping the dev's can tackle these issues.

4 ) Micro Transactions - if you don't like them, don't make them. Let me back up. With 2K21 you'd win cash for each successful showing in a tournament, great. All we could do with said cash was buy clothing. Could it be any more boring. I'm ecstatic to see there's new options for said winnings and delve into that. Now i can improve my play with better clubs and equipment, yay. Here's the thing, you can still master your game without all these extra little cheats. It's realism. I think back to the 50's and 60's when clubs chunks of metal on tubes of metal. The pro's were still able to wield those tools like a surgeon and make spectacular shots. My advice, play at a comfortable, fun difficulty setting and buy upgrades you're not having to pay real cash for.

5 ) Versatility - This game is so loaded with options that literally anyone regardless of gaming skill can find the right level of difficulty and realism to have fun. For myself as an older player, I just don't have the dexterity in my hands or the swift reaction of all you younger gamer boys. I've got oversized, shakey hands that just can't be as precise as I'd need to be at higher difficulty. I can make adjustments.

6 ) Price tag - Holy crap this game is pricey!!! I believe the first incarnation of the Golf Club sold for either $20 or $30, yet back then there was no ""pro golf"" play, no big names, no big developers like 2K, and zero PGA support. Unfortunately for us, the golf sim genre is not the most popular so that means a dev is limited in potential buyers of this game. I realized this when I started investing in train sims. This just means that if we want to play a golf game, chances are it's not going to feel like it's worth the price we pay.

7 ) Big names - Tiger Woods, 2K, PGA Tour, etc, all of these are not only going to drive up the cost, but these big names are going to have certain expectations that the game designers will have to fulfill. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that 2K pushed for micro transactions, or that the PGA Tour pushed for more realistic, believable play. Who knows, but you know a chunk of the price of this game is going to Tiger himself.

Conclusion - Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. In this cancel culture we live in, everybody feels entitled to expect everything they want, whether it's a movie franchise, a restaurant, or a game title. The greatest aspect of both 2K21 and 2K23 lies in the ability change your gameplay experience. And of course, that it's golf!",1667750760,1667750760,True,2,1,0.491620123386383057,0,True,False,False

I have played games that were amazing, like the Tiger Woods 2004-2007 era, and I have played decent games, like PGA 2k21, and I have played bad games, like Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, and now... PGA 2k23. 

Being a hardcore golf fan, and only getting a new game every few years, I felt the need to pre-order the Tiger Woods Edition. While I played the game before it's actual release date, there were tons of issues. There have since been some fixes, but the game overall is a major letdown. Here are my thoughts:

 - Save the money if you have 2k21, the changes in this game are not worth it AT ALL.
 - Career Mode: It may take a long trial period to determine correct AI difficulty. However, there will ALWAYS be 1 ""player"" week in and week out that outscores the rest of the field by at least 7 or more shots. No fun that way.
 - After years and years to work on the game, gameplay issues stand out. If your ball rolls 20 yards down the fairway and rolls into water, the game will give you the option to replay last shot, or travel the wrong direction across 100 yards of water and have you play a shot from a completely ridiculous location. How has that not been fixed??
 - Swing mechanics have gotten better since initial release, but there are glaring inconsistencies with swing meter, even after multiple swing calibrations.
 - Online modes have not changed at all. Nothing new to offer.

The one cool thing they added however, is the installation of attribute points and archetypes. This can let you pick your strength and use it to your advantage. This was a big thing in the Tiger Woods game I mentioned earlier. Only took 17 years to get them back...

In the end, I will continue to play this game because of the amount of money I have put into it. I will happily change and or delete this review if things are fixed in the future.

I played a ton of PGA Tour 2k21 and was excited to see what changed with the new release. The answer? Not much.

This is more of an incremental upgrade than a whole new version.

They've added 3-Click swing (which honestly I cannot comment on because I've grown to love the analog swing) and upped the microtransactions for tons of cosmetics, and they've also done a handful of physics tweaks. Nothing huge gameplay wise. I was able to take my Master settings from 2k21 and every difficulty modifier I had turned on and move into the new game with little adjustment.

So I'll break it down into positives and negatives.

Pros:

Improved performance. This is big for me. 2k21 stuttered on my system during many official courses. Now? Stutter free and that makes for much smoother gameplay.

Better graphics. Not a massive upgrade, but better animations, more human looking players, and improved terrain.

The physics have been tweaked just a bit to make for more realistic bounces and rolls. As someone who plays golf in the real world, this now feels even more like genuine golf.

Career mode is still fun, if a little undercooked. I play each event as a 4-round game, just like real golf, and I dig the thrill of making the cut or holding on to the lead into Sunday. It feels good, if a little underwhelming with the anemic rivals system.

Club fittings now adjust club performance instead of brand. You can use brand merely for cosmetic purposes and tweak your clubs with the unlockable fittings, which you do not need to apply to every club in a set. Just want to tweak the power of your pitching wedge while leaving the sand and gap alone? Go ahead. It allows for much more customization. And each fitting has positives and negatives to affect your play so you can't just buy to win.

The meh:

Replays are still bare bones basic. No changing the camera for you!

The new caddie option is so underbaked it's bizarre. The caddie just shows in cutscenes and offers no gameplay change, which is fine, but why can't you design your caddie's appearance? You just choose from a handful of premade ones like it's an old Super Nintendo game.

The default ball type has almost no spin and rolls like crazy. This took a ton of adjustment to understand. Even a yellow elevation change on the green will cause your ball to roll for miles. Some courses this is obviously worse than others. The Redline ball is the closest I've found to 2k21's ball with spin, bounce, and roll. And of course, these balls are consumable, so I've taken to using with care.

The drop system is still broken and totally unlike real golf. C'mon, guys, that's just lazy!

tl/dr: Not a real ""upgrade"" over 2k21, but I'm having a ton of fun with it. For most people, purchase when it's on sale. If you've never played the PGA Tour series, this is a good entry to start because it's even more user friendly than before, with the addition of the 3-click swing.",1667314218,1667314218,True,15,1,0.682068169116973877,0,True,False,False

I don't get to know? Just keep guessing? Too lazy to develop their own original courses so they had to use content creators and call them ""2K official"". The lack of gear is also so glaring.

Speaking of clubs, wtf is ""club fittings""??? You're telling me I can hit my driver 380+ yards now with barely hindering my ability to swing on time, hmmm very balanced.

I upgraded from TGC 2019. 2K23 takes a big leap forward from TGC 2019, vastly improved graphics and an emphasis on character development, making the game more replayable.

The graphics; for which the game has always taken a natural look over being overdone, is vastly improved.

COURSE DESIGNER

Course design is now extremely competitive, with superb quality courses being uploaded almost every 10-15 minutes. Only the best designers and the best courses, receive generous amount of play.

The upgraded designer has many improved features. Splines are so much easier to use, the days of laying brushes one by one are almost over, with the exception of Remove Auto-generated objects, Out of Bounds and possibly a few other tools. 

Fences and Bridges are now far easier to place with a spline option for the fences and snap options for the bridges. A horrific, tedious job that would have taken 30 minutes, now takes a minute at most. 

I wish you could zoom the camera out more in the designer, so you can see the whole, square plot, it would make designing terrain much easier.

The downsides are, very few new assets, with no new clubhouses, though there does seem to be far more natural assets, probably by including every theme asset within the object menu, as opposed to, this is a desert theme, so that’s your choice. 

There needs to be more, larger rock features as rockwork is still a tedious job, some pre-sets would help a lot. The spline option for placing trees and other natural objects, works, but it isn’t as good as the multi-place feature, leaving sparse amounts of terrain uncovered and putting huge pressure on the engine when the spline area is large.

GAMEPLAY

The Career mode is much better than previous releases, but still falls short of the legendary Tiger Woods EA games. There are about 30 or so events, and 6 tiers of rivals, but once you complete them, they cycle over and over. There’s a trophy animation now added, a very reserved animation, which goes for the player golfer’s animations in general. We are not quite yet at the same intensity, thrill and energy that the TW animations had, YAARRHH! Vs, argh, hole in one, can’t I do any better? The crowd noises are much better this time round, but could be even more intense for events like holes in ones and albatrosses, perhaps even record some special ones for par 4 and 5 hole in ones?

The biggest downside to the game is the systems around club fittings, equipment and the disastrous golf balls. This game uses virtual currencies (VC’s ($ for this reviews convenience)) just like the previous games. But the amount of VC’s that you earn have been dramatically reduced. Come on, ($)250 for winning a PGA Tour event? My favourite golf ball in the game is the Legendary Aviator LV1. For a pack of 12 of these balls its $900, If I am lucky, I will get $250, $100 for my rival award if I beat them and $100 sponsor, so the absolute max is around the $4-500. But sponsor rewards will eventually setop, because once I have maxed out all sponsors, that's it. Often, I don’t even get any VC’s for completing a PGA Tour event.

This is where the game gets overly cruel. I would have thought for those 12, $900 balls, I would lose one every time I go in the water or out of bounds. NO, it’s worse than that. I lose a ball, every time I complete an event, but I don’t seem to lose them, when they actually go out of bounds or in the water! Every time I want to refill those balls, I need to complete 4 rounds of golf (costing 4 ball itself), to maybe, get the VC. But since there is no guarantee of that VC coming in, I may have to play 5, 6 or even more rounds. Then fittings:

Fittings are a great way to spice up game play and to offer players more options about how they want to play the game. I currently have a powerhouse arch-type, combined with the balls, a 99 power driver and the power boost skills, I can hit regular 350y carry. Fittings get expensive when you get to legendary class, $150 per club, per fitting. It’s easy to spend $1000 on just fitting out your clubs with one type, Club, Shaft or Grip. You can upgrade your fittings which, oh thank goodness, you don’t have to pay to do that, not yet… new idea 2K? It costs you 3 fittings to upgrade to a higher fitting, so to go from lowest to highest, costs a huge number of fittings. Luckily, the game rewards you with different classes of fittings. It isn’t right that you should have to give up 3 fittings to exchange for another, perhaps just pay a very small VC instead?
There is a cap of 100 for each skill power, transition, timing etc. Which is bit strange because there is no need for it, other than players who could abuse the system? But 2K is very strict with game regulation and throughout your play; it’s obvious the game is making checks against data from another server.

The biggest gripe I have with the game is that progress is way too slow and sadly, as is the whole direction of the gaming industry, the franchise is leaning towards PTW (Pay to Win). This isn’t entirely true with this game perhaps because Bethesda’s Skyrim and Fallout games have also exponential XP level up systems. Idealistically, with 40 hours invested in the game, maybe 50, I would like to have all my skills fully kitted out. With 40 hours spent on the game, there is still the top tier to unlock. 

Faster levelling, more fittings and at least double the VC’s for each Career event won would improve the game, but once again, you can indeed ‘fast track’ your progress… you buy a clubhouse pass… which gives you more rewards, more apparel and equipment, which compared to TGC 2019, 2K23 has hardly any apparel in it at all and you cannot change the colour either. It’s sad to see the franchise taking this micro transactional direction, it’s not pay to win, its pay to be more satisfied with the game. Don’t pay, then be teased, helplessly.

What is totally wrong though, is that no-one should lose a golf ball for every round, when they haven’t actually lost one. The legendary aviator is only adding 15 or so yards to my shot, which leaves my drive around 315, about the same as TW from TWPGAT 06. This isn’t right.

Talking of Tiger Woods… I just can’t. really, £100? Really? Now, if 2K had a real AI rivals mode to go with that, as well as some other fun ways to be able to use a range of PGA pro’s, If Tiger Woods came with maxed out skills, 100 points in every attribute (maybe over 100), just like the old TW games, then great, do it, but otherwise, there is no incentive for me to buy this pack.

Topgolf is a good inclusion in the game, clearly though a real world IP, it’s inspired by a play mode within the TW games we all know and love. In the future, I would like to see the possibility of being able to make custom arenas within the course designer; I think I already saw some guy make a Driving Range par 3 course, kind of inspired by the idea.

CONCLUSION

8/10

2K23 is the best in the series to date and is the closest we have come to a TW game. 2K have clearly taken on board, the recent refocus golf game fans have taken to the old TW games. I think 2K may have felt pressured to finish the newly upgraded game in time for the 2 year release window. I think 2K25, if called so, could stand a chance at becoming as good as the old TW games.

It would be really beneficial for 2K, while they can, to make improvements to the game via updates, while the game is still freshly released. Would I recommend it to new players? If this is your first time, I would recommend it. If you are upgrading from a version older than 2K21, yeah, go for it I suppose. If you are upgrading from 2K21, can’t say. I would definitely recommend just sticking to the standard version of the game, unless 2K really make a huge change to the Tiger Woods edition that makes it so irresistible.

8/10 for a drastically improved game, the next release really could be on par with the old TW game, but it’s quite clear now, EA will have their turn first…

When come animation of other player - it crash.
When whatever you do - it crash.

Animation of players -> same. Maybe 10% new.
Courses, and everything around -> same.
Animation of water when ball drop there -> same -> zero.
Animation of sand when ball drop there -> same ->  zero.
Main menu is total unfriendly.
Editation of your avatar -> worse. Almost 75% less than last years.
Optimalisation of game -> zero -> Maybe worse than before.

Competetive matches i played last time in PGA 2K19.
In PGA 2K21 and PGA 2K23 does not work.
You get message about your lost internet connection. Bullshit.
Developers general advice are useless. Everything is useless. And nobody is working on it about 4 years.
It does not work!!!

All new mechanics and features are in this game only for grinding and are useless.

Or you want to play game against other players.
You do not want to collect various crap to improve your equipment.

And on the end one more thing.
You buy it for 60€ or more.
Maybe for 120€.
I think, all developers worked long two years only on next monetization. 
You can pay for ""ClubhousePass"" Premium or Premium+ for real money.
If you do not buy this ""ClubhousePass"" grind will be for very long time.
It does not matter, but.....It is not necessary to buy it, but in game for full price it is shame.

The main difference is the three-click system, which is actually kinda nice for mouse and keyboard users. Otherwise, it's the same game with the same infuriating pitfalls.
- Menus are clunky, slow, and confusing.
- Connecting to their servers is clunky, slow, and unnecessarily constant.
- Same boring music as before. Lacks energy.
- Awful, repetitive commentary hasn't changed much and it's pointless.
- Online play options are even MORE clunky, slow, and paired down from 2k21.

Greens are AWFUL.  When far away, you cant see just how bad the greens tilt.  Chip shot is not reliable when close and usually runs forever.  Any tilt on the green (even 1"") will cause the ball to go right off the green.  When putting from off the green (because chip shots are not reliable and a completely useless shot when closer than 8 yds to the hole), the speed of the putt is exceedingly fast where I have to aim less than half the speed normally used - even when the putt is uphill.

And honestly im at a loss for words with this game, i was so excited for the release of this game, for week i saw the promotional stuff and thought this was going to be the best game yet. Sadly the spent more of promotion than the game... and it shows. Crashes, multiplayer not working, random freezes, and a host of small issues. I love designing in these games and this is the worst one fore designers yet, i will not be surprised to see a lack of new courses created because of how slow the designer has become. From the slow rotations, the annoyance of selecting any object, some objects no longer work like hot air balloons. The game play is ok, its much harder than the last game in terms of putting and hitting to the point that it can be flat out frustrating. The new leveling and golf balls take away alot of the competitive feel of the game because someone who has all the maxed clubs and perks will crush any new player.
It is also so sad to see this game go sooo pay to win, and not even for a good price. $5 for 600 coins? are you crazy? Not to mention how useless the Deluxe and Tiger Woods edition are. The even went to battle passes... like... cmon...
I just cant help but feel the game uses its perks and new golf balls and shafts to cover up the copy past that the game is. Do you remember what happened when the copy pasted TGC to TGC2, it flopped, and i feel like this is the same thing with sprinkles(perks) on top. And some how they managed to mess up so many little things in the game.
I also wanted to mention that some of the courses in the career were obviously not play tested. From impossible pins on slopes to bushes blocking the tees/views.

This is 2022, these graphics are atrocious. Whoever at EA is in charge of character creation....that entire department needs to be fired. I have seen better animated faces on Indie games. I have seen better animated faces on early 2000s Tiger Woods PGA games. Fire that entire department. They are trash at their jobs. Additionally, the level of detail on maxed out graphics, it laughable. Hades has better graphics and details and doesn't require as power hardware to run. Pay attention to the NPCs in the background and when they're clapping, their hands don't make contact. It's hilarious how badly you have to code something when your NPCs can't properly put their hands together. 

The game play is alright. Play three rounds with the grid turned on to learn the green system, then you can go to pro difficulty with no problem and kill everyone. The AI in this game is a joke. My first tournament after making it to the PGA in this game was on the hardest difficulty and I won it with -12. The AI had -2. The single most annoying thing though is the replay system. When trying to watch a good shot of your own, it shows the character only. No view of the shot. No camera controls. Nothing. But even more annoying than that is when you're playing a tourny and it shows you ""live updates"" of other golfers. Bro. I do not give a flying rats poop about other crappy animated golfers and how they did. I am trying to golf my own game and win this. I don't need to be dragged down by watching something else after every time I finish a hole. Goodness. 

I had hope for this game but it's a walking dumpster fire. I cannot recommend it in this state. The game is playable but you're not going to enjoy it. I honestly have no idea how stupid EA/2K can be. Take the Tiger Woods Masters game, give it a modern day face lift and republish it. You will have an instant success instead of failing to reinvent the wheel.

Building off of PGA TOUR 2K21, they've designed what I believe is the most accurate and realistic golf video game to date. The most notable improvements are in the short game. Shots around the green are no longer as routine as they were in 2K21. Chip, approach and splash shots require more skill and can go wrong quickly if you're not careful. Punch shots were also added, which will help you get out of trouble if you find yourself off the fairway under the trees (and trust me, you will).

The challenges this realism presents you with are what makes the game so fun. Just like real golf, the feeling you get when you execute a great shot is what will keep you coming back. Even after you get the swing timing and mechanics right, there's always a chance you can hit it poorly. Every shot feels important.

With that being said, the difficulty settings of the game can be tailored for any skill level. The addition of the 3 click swing will help those who aren't comfortable with the standard analog stick swing.

Beyond the actual gameplay, 2K23 falls a bit short. The MyCareer mode, while slighty better than 2K21, still feels lackluster.

I have 500+ hours played in PGA 2k21 and it's one of my favourite games I've played in a long time but charging full price for a glorified patch update is robbery. I'll still play this ""version"" of 2k21 regardless but If I could get a refund for it, I would.

CONS:
- No leaderboards. How are you going to release this game without the most basic matchmaking feature that was in the game on launch day for 2k21? There's nothing to work forward to when you're playing against other people, there's no sense of competition. Ridiculous.

- Reusing the same voice lanes from 2k21. This is a slap in the face and screams laziness. I appreciate they added some new voice lines but recycling all the old ones is embarrassing.

- Career mode is still fairly bland and doesn't add anything new. You can't even play against ghosts for your rival matches or playoff holes. Mario Golf 64 did this over 20 years ago, what's the point of adding all the new professional players if you can't even play against them. Figure it out.

- The replays. God damn! These replays are still just as bad as they were in 2k21. There's no camera function, no way to see your shot in multiple angles, no way to slow it down... A lot of the time it'll give you these completely unwatchable angles that doesn't give the feeling of hitting a nice shot. It's almost pointless.

- Graphical performance seems worse now. While I'm one of the few people who actually didn't mind the graphics in 2k21 (It pretty good to me), there's essentially no difference between this and 2k21. It's difficult to see any improvement that warrants having the performance hit.

- Green speeds are ridiculous. It feels like you're playing in Augusta every hole and that you're putting on ice. They are too fast. I did not experience this at all in 2k21. Apparently you can change your balls so that they perform differently on the green but I haven't experimented with that nor should that be a feature in my opinion.

- The customisation for the appearance of your golfer has somehow gotten worse. I have no idea how this was possible. You can't even change the weight of your golfer anymore... There's very few things you can change physically aside from the clothing options.

PROS:

- Short game has gotten more difficult and nerfed. I welcome this change because pitch shots in 2k21 were overpowered and chipping on the green completely eliminated the need for putting. Splash shots are more difficult to hit as well. Other than that, there isn't too much of a difference but it's still a big change.

- Voice communication is finally implemented in PC matchmaking. A very nice change.

- Top golf is a pretty cool feature. I'm not going to play on it much but I appreciate that they added it in here.

- The music is nice.

- This could be a positive or a negative depending on who you ask but I think the progression you can do for your golfer is interesting. Lots of different things you can apply which change how you play. While I'm not a huge fan of it, I'm sure there are people who enjoy it.

Wait for this game to get on sale and then try it out. I still love the core gameplay here, it's really fun but there's not much separating this between the previous iteration of PGA besides a different coat of paint. If you don't have 2k21, I'd suggest getting this instead but would not recommend paying full price for it-- only look into it if you're a hardcore PGA 2k21 player.",1666138316,1666138316,False,69,3,0.83061826229095459,0,True,False,False

My only complaint about this game is the sponsorships I wish it was like 2k21 were you could select that sponsor level that sponsorship all the way up then move on. I play this game mostly for the career aspect of it which I am sure 90% of you do as well. This game compared to 2k21 is a little more difficult being which that if you use a joystick and when you swing if you hit the ball perfect and you accidently push the stick slightly left or right it will mess you up. 

To everyone complaining about the microtransactions you simply so not need to buy VC in this game and just earn the VC through playing. Its just like 2k21 you want a different club then either you buy the VC or you earn the VC through playing. 

I love the battle pass system in this game as well just like in 2k21 gives me something extra to work towards. If you are like me I do not buy battlepasses anymore till I complete the pass first so I do not waste 10 dollars.

The skill trees are basically useless unless you do specific things and then they're active and throw off your game when you're not expecting it, they feel like an afterthought rather than a full skill tree to actually improve skills.  The clubs being just cosmetic is a big step back, even if they aren't wildly different like last game at least have them have slightly different skills.

Update after 36 hours of play:
####################

- Replay system still broken.
- The 'purchase better balls' thing sucks. I just stick to the free ball.
- I got a bit better.
- Worth it if you play daily - if you're a Sunday driver, think again as you have to play a lot to get/stay good.

#################
Original Review (after 15 hours play):
#################

Pros:
- Visually it's better than PGA2K21, but not that much better. In fact, it's marginal. The player models look worse.
- The menus are much nicer - the dark vibe is much better on my ageing eyes.
- There's some more interesting content with the TopGolf but I suspect I won't ever play it.
- Playing as Pros if you like that sort of thing.
- The Skills thing in interesting - too early to tell if that's going to be useful or not.

Cons:
- There's some really odd ball physics going on - greens on the same courses act very differently, more so than I'd expect.
- Balls stop dead one minute then run for 20 yards the next on seemingly the same shot in very similar conditions.
- The replay system is broken - 9 times out of 10 it just shows my player face/body shot and you don't see any of the replayed shot. Why would I want to watch the face of a crappy character model rather than the ball? Just turn it off to keep vaguely sane.
- Around the green, play seems fairly random - chip shots do one thing one shot then behave completely differently the next. Just put full backspin on every chip shot and splash else you'll need a driver to get back to the hole.

Personal observations:
- Putting seems much harder, so you might like this or loathe it. I'm undecided.
- Not sure I really like the camera angles or camera tracking - it's made me feel dizzy a few times.
- I seem unable to make my player any fatter then stick thin. I can change their height but am I missing something here? Can us fatties not play golf? Shame on you, 2K.

If you're not desperate, then pick up 2K21 cheap and play the heart out of that and wait until this has dropped in price. A lesson learned for me there as this isn't worth £50 or the pre-release prices in its current state, to me anyway.

On the plus side, EA dropped the teaser trailer for their new beast on pre-release day of this game. Cheeky :-)",1665739537,1666025669,False,58,4,0.779627799987792969,4,True,False,False

I have well over 4,000 hours in this series since TGC2 and will no doubt rack up another 1k hours on this one, it's the ultimate relaxing game while listening to audiobooks or podcasts for me.

If you are even remotely a golf enthusiast or even just a golf game enthusiast, this is 100% worth a buy even at the extortionate price since there's zero competition out there... 

Pros of the new game:

- 3-click system, this is by far the biggest change. It's a lot of fun, adds a whole new dimension to playing, but requires too much cognitive effort compared to analogue swings for me. I'm impressed how close they made the Pro level 3-click difficulty with Pro level analogue swing, shame that's not the same for Master, where 3-click is almost un-playably hard. If that balance can be attained I think 3-click could be the only viable way to have genuinely fair cross-platform competitions (e.g. TGC Tours with PS and Xbox), bypassing the controller lottery / dodgy after-market controllers / scripts.

- Skilling up options for particular shots, particular club fittings and being able to pick your player's 'archetype', sacrificing certain skills (e.g. distance) over others (e.g. putt control). How balanced these are, time will tell, but adds a nice new flavour to the experience.

- Splash shots are no longer over-powered and only available from bunkers which is great, however they're now a con too because they're massively underpowered and provide zero spin. Chipping from bunkers is now the percentage play.... This is clearly a bug and I fully expect it to be fixed in a future patch.

- Playing as pros, tiger woods etc., these have no interest for me whatsoever but if it helps build the user base and grow the series (and then add pressure on the devs to fix certain issues like below) then it's great.

Cons:

- While tempo errors are less punishing with a wider grey zone (which is welcome as bad tempo shots have always been overly punishing in previous iterations of the game imo, at least on PC), they've 'balanced' this by making off centre swing lines much, much more punishing. From a pure gameplay perspective this is no bad thing, the problem is that the recent focus on tempo over straightness made the game (more or less) immune from those with straight shooting controllers. Now that straight shooting is rewarded, expect to see lots of people buying after-market controllers and posting silly scores in societies.

- Replays are as worthless as the last game. We know you have lots of awesome camera angles 2K / HB, why on earth don't you use them? Nobody on the planet gets anything from seeing a white ball against a white / blue sky background for a few seconds before suddenly colliding with a green. We want to see the full context of our awesome shot with a follow cam from various angles.",1665933622,1665934322,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've been eagerly awaiting the latest instalment of PGA2K since it was announced as I was a huge fan on 2k21 and continued to play it for many hours each week. In my opinion 2K21 has few issues and I hoped the issues it did have would be addressed with the latest instalment. I had high hopes going into 2K23 as newer had to be better right?

Lets start with the positives:
Tiger!
New shots (punch)
New courses
More player customisation (more on this to come later)

Obviously a lot has been made of Tiger being associated with the game and it's nice to see him in it but he doesn't really add that much. The addition of the punch shot is nice and it adds some nice variation to the shot offerings of 2k21. I haven't had chance to play many of the new courses but I know a few of them were co-designed by crazycanuck1985 which can only be a good thing and they do look and play wonderfully. Player customisation is greatly improved from 2k21 however this is both a good and a bad thing, more customisation is always good and the being able to choose an architype is nice.

Now onto the bad:
Top Golf is a pointless addition
All clubs have the same stats and need to be modified by 'fittings'
New UI has issues
The ability to upgrade 'myPlayer' is very weirdly implemented
Inconsistent greens and other bugs
Little actual improvement from 2k21

So Top Golf has been added to the game however it is basically a waste of time, there is very little to it and once you have played it a few times it's worthless. There are far better things that could have been done in it's place.

One of the most mind-boggling changes made is that clubs all have the same stats now and you need to modify how they play by earnings 'fittings' by playing the game. This makes no sense at all and is a massive step backwards. 

The new UI looks nice at first but is actually a step backwards from 2k21 and was a needless change. It can be hard to even see the swing metre when you're deep in the bunker and the white from the bunker merges in with the white on the swing metre. Simple was better here and I feel change was made as a way to differentiate from the old game but is actually a step backwards. Club and shot selection are harder to see than in the old game also.

When I heard there was more customisation and improvements coming to 'myPlayer' I was optimistic I'd be able to use skill points to upgrade certain stats such as timing, strength, flexibility or even certain shots but that's not really the case. Instead of that you unlock passive abilities whilst playing the game which just seems unnecessary and is overly complex. The least said about this the better!

Since day one it does seem like some bugs have been fixed but there are still simple bugs and weirdness that should have been picked up before the games release. Another reviewer commented that greens seem inconsistent on the same course and I feel the same, on one whole you can drive the green and the ball will land and stop immediately and on the next hole a pitched 9 iron will land and roll out the length of the green -  it just feels weird. Replays don't really work and just show the player after taking the shot instead of the ball and don't seem to trigger correctly (holed out from 130 yards and got no replay).

There really isn't enough change to move over from 2k21 and a lot of the game is a step backwards. It seems a lot of the game has been built around micro transactions instead of focusing on a solid game. There was so much potential that just has been missed out on and some of the additions are just a distraction (Tiger, TopGolf). I'll be refunding and going back to 2k21, maybe after 6 months of patches and a price reduction I'll give it another go.

The angle in which a ball is lying, the variable winds, the set-up of your club, swing timing and accuracy ALL will have a major impact on each and every stroke.

So to be quick, here are some pros and cons versus PGA TOUR 2k21:
PROs:
- Playable Tiger (?) - although I couldnt find ANYWHERE to change to that but its in there somewhere
- The ball flight physics is somewhat better, now I can shape my shots way better than 2k21
- More clubs selection, although Taylormade seems to take all the spotlight from the battlepass
- You can actually upgrade the club by ""fitting"", increase your golfer's abilities of your choice (Bryson like drives or throwing darts with irons like Morikawa)

Cons:
- The swing calibration is totally horseshit. Calibrated 7 times (70 shots) yet I still swing ""too fast"" on my downswing
- The graphic needs more touch (ball's shadow rolling on green at max graphic setting)
- Harder to swing the club comparing at the same difficulty as in 2021 (prob. personal feeling)
- Character creation has very few options, especially comparing to 2k21
- Most highlights will only show your golfer staring down the ball as it flies

Overall a great update from 2021, but not worth the $60 price tag ($100ish pre order for me) and 2 years of waiting

My biggest personal gripe is that if you have a bad internet connection, or if there are any network problems being experienced, the game will sit at a black screen after a shot. There is still audio, the game is still drawing frames etc. but you are forced to sit there until it either disconnects, or figures out what it wants to do.

The biggest change to this game is the balls, which also creates the biggest problems. The greens react more like they would in real life. Hit a short chip downhill? Yea, that's going off the green. There's a certain level of realism that should be taken into consideration though and I personally think some courses are way too punishing, especially for casual play. 

The biggest problem... You can purchase different balls using in-game currency (which can be bought or earned by playing). These balls can do multiple (game breaking honestly) things, balls that can spin like crazy, ones that won't roll and stick like a magnet. Balls are limited though, you use up 1 per round, dunk it in the water as many times as you want in that round, it doesn't affect anything. This is a cycle that makes sense in end-game when you have nothing to spend in-game currency on, but creates an incredibly unbalanced experience.

The new Archetypes feel lackluster, when switching between them you will notice very minimal changes, especially rhythm. Most of your stats will be bolstered by skills (which feel counter intuitive) or fittings (different items you can upgrade your clubs with). The biggest problem with fittings, is that they are random drops. You can only upgrade same tier fittings to a specific one you need, or a tier higher, which forces you to grind endlessly for drops. Skills just feel half baked, they work on an activation/deactivation system. Miss 3 FiR? Get a bonus swing path boost off the tee. Hit a FiR? That buff is taken away. Also, I just learned while writing this, that if you disconnect from their services; your MyPlayer will effectively reset all of their skills and be level 1.

I enjoy the new MYplayer features, like the skill tree and fittings. I think it's silly that in previous versions of the game the clubs influenced yardage. It just makes sense that these stats are tied to your player/ball.

With that being said, there is some shit that drives me absolutely insane about this and I am surprised that these things weren't enhanced with a 2 year gap between titles.

Announcers:
Recycling the old announcers statements is so disappointing. Good announcers in sports games add so much to the immersion of the career mode, and it's unfortunate that we hear Rich Beem say the exact same lines we have heard since 2k21.

Multi-player camera angles:
There's nothing more annoying than only being able to see 3 angles of your opponents ass while they take 3 practice swings (with a slower animation than 2k21)

LET US FLY, 2K. WE WANT TO ZOOM AROUND WHILE OUR OPPONENTS GETS THEIR PIZZA ROLLS OUT OF THE OVEN.

Physics:
This could very well be a learning curve, but the greens seemingly have a ridiculous amount of what I would call ""micro-undulation"", where your putt reads smooth left to right, then when you hit that thing it moves side to side like a middle schooler dancing to Cha-Cha Slide by Mr. C the Slide Man at the local roller rink.

All in all it's a good game and I think this franchise set a president with golf sim games, and I can't call it bad. It's just lacking a level of polish that you would associate with a 60 AAA title.

The ball physics.

Kind of important in a golf game and yet somehow, they managed to fuck it up. I don't know what level of research goes into these games, or if the people who make them actually play golf in real life. But you wouldn't be being unreasonable if you expected the people responsible for the physics engine to at least visit a golf course and try hitting a few chips and putts on and around the green. You know, just to observe how the ball reacts in different conditions and what not, but no, apparently that was just too much effort. 

So what do we end up with then? Well, in a nutshell we end up with a physics engine that behaves completely unpredictably when playing the most important shots in the game. Got a slightly downhill putt? Well, you better breathe on that ball and then pray to whichever god(s) you believe in that your putt wont just keep crawling and crawling and crawling along until it just runs off the green, leaving you with an equally unpredictable chip back on. The same applies to chip shots from the fringe/fairway/rough around the greens and to greenside bunkers. The entire short game and putting is a crap shoot which ruins the experience.

I'm hoping they're aware of this issue and are working to fix it, but given that they released the game with the physics in this state doesn't fill me with confidence. If a patch for this isn't incoming soon, I'll be going back to PGA Tour 2k21, or moving to the EA game when that comes out, assuming it's not a typical EA shitfest of MT garbage and underbaked gameplay.

You can't even purchase currency yet, and currency you will be able to purchase is the exact same currency you win for playing. I understand people don't want to work for anything anymore but micro-transactions only exist in the form of a club pass and that's pretty normal. Again, the transactions in this game are no different than anything in the last 20 years. You play, you earn money. You spend the money. People who say otherwise are absolutely lying to you. This game isn't tore up with micro-transactions. 

The game mechanically plays really well, the addition of 3-click improves accessibility for people who can't use swing stick or get the hang of it. 3-click doesn't offer any extra advantage that the screen cheat users haven't been doing for years on PGA games. 

I was a little mixed on the changes to clubs. Clubs themselves don't provide any value outside of swing sounds (Cobra Driver sounds fantastic). At first i hated it, but this means Club fittings that you find throughout the game are where the value is at. This also means that every player in the game wont use the same set of clubs because they're the best ""2k21."" This change is pretty decent and I think the envelope can be pushed here for more customization. The archetypes are great, this allows you to pick something that helps you in your game. I can hit it hard and I approach pretty well, but I struggle consistently with timing so I don't slice. I chose Rhythm archetype to help compensate for that. But if you struggle with recovery shots or putting there's one for that too. 

I've played this game every night since early release and this game is a huge step in the right direction. 2K21 lacked depth, and 2K23 is moving in the right direction. The customization is improving and with ""Daily, weekly and featured"" pro shop items the options will continue to grow. Again, all the currency is earned at a decent rate in Career and Online mode. You can even wager in society and competitive play to win more.

I expected EA to crap the bucket, but honestly I'm in love with the game. I'm happy with the release and hope they'll continue adjusting and adding to it.

They also changed putting to a point where I would rather chip on the greens.

Pros:
-Easy to pick up and play for any player. It has a lot of difficulty adjustments that allow both beginners and pros to enjoy the game. Maybe you just like to play casually, you can! 
-The course choices are nice, there is a variety and are clear to understand where the hazards are and where the fairway and greens are. 
-This seems to be up for debate but I found the controls fine. They are smooth for me, but this can also depend on control type the player uses, I use an Xbox controller. 

Cons:
-Customization and the pro shop could be a lot more detailed. The pro shop is like any other F2P game these days with a timer based shop, I don't get the point of that in this game. Also I feel player customization is somewhat limited, we could use more options and details.
- The micro transactions are not terrible but they are a cause for concern. Particularly the ball sleeves. These seem unnecessary. I have yet to use them but they seem to be consumables and since Legendary ones are locked behind this, I just decided it's not worth it to try and use them. 
-Denuvo, I don't need to say much else. My PC handles it fine but I know this affects lower end gaming PCs or non gaming PCs. 

Side note, do not get any other version than the Standard. Not only do some folks seem to have issues getting their bonus items but also, the prices are a bit steep for just cosmetic items and some VC. Just stick with the $59.99 version (or wait till it's on sale). 

In conclusion, this game does have its flaws. I personally found enjoyment in it, but I can see the issues that others are complaining about can put some bumps in the experience.

The 59.99 for the Standard Edition of the game was $59.99 well spent in my book.  In my eyes, much like 2K21, the $60 price tag is a good value.  I'm not sure if I could say the same had I spent the cash on the Deluxe Edition or the Tiger Woods edition. This review kind of builds on my 2K21 review, so, if you haven't read that one and are curious, feel free to check that out.  

PGA Tour 2K23 does improve upon many game elements that I felt really took away from the potential of 2K21.  For starters, they do offer ball selections and even the TP5 Pix golf balls.  The sounds in general (with the exception of the commentary) have been improved upon.   I like many of the small details that were not preset in 2K21 such as being able to hear the ball whizzing off the tee when you really rope one down the center on the fairway or the ball flight being seemingly more authentic compared to 2K21. Or the fact that you now have a Caddie.  Or even the fact that you can now carry more than one sponsor simultaneously.  I also really like the inclusion of Top Golf and how many people came together to make this game possible (Steph Curry, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan).  2K23 did a great job of offering more character based performance improvement options, which I felt was something that was missing from 2K21 as performance was largely based on equipment benefits over character specific attributes. You can build your character around a specific playstyle, each of which offers different pros and cons.  The PGA Players are also actually playable in this game, which is a plus.  There are some new equipment options which were previously unavailable in 2K21 such as Scotty Cameron and Cobra.  These improvements provide an enjoyable game experience and an experience that really does make 2K23 feel like a truly new game, which is a big plus given that many other 2K titles feel a bit recycled. 

With that being said, there still is some bad which I will get into now.  First and foremost, I still feel that the MyCareer lacks immersion.  I was hoping for (probably unreasonably) a career experience that more closely resembled the experience provided in NBA 2K.  The structure is still generally the same and honestly, it's not only similar to 2K21, but also a bit boring.  My second gripe is that there are no different swing styles.  It definitely gets old seeing everyone with the same generic swing, especially tour pros like Tiger Woods.  With all of the time that was invested in other parts of the game, I feel that this was one part of the game that was both possible to improve upon, but also would have been worthwhile to invest the time into.  Thirdly, the balls specifically should not offer performance benefits.  In fact, no equipment should offer any sort of performance benefits, because that is not how it works in real life.  I know this has been complained about already for various reasons, but players should be able to use whatever brands they like without having to worry about their player's performance statistics suffering as a result.  Lastly, most of the commentary is recycled.  Again, the 2K ream did a great job in a lot of areas, they did a great job marketing and selling their game, but some of that time could have been invested elsewhere.  We do have the addition of one commentator, but we also still have the same old commentator and voice lines from 2K21.  With all of the other changes that are seemingly so focused on attention to detail, it was baffling to me why this was not also something that was improved upon.  There are also a few small things that I have faith will be improved upon at some point, such as the replays being downright terrible.  

Overall, PGA Tour 2K23 is a good buy at $60.  I am enjoying the game so far and expect to also put many hours into this game, but it's just not at the point where I can play it and not say ""I wish.""",1665728981,1665728981,True,4,4,0.497328072786331177,0,True,False,False

On the fringe and want to putt instead of chip like normal person? The game automatically lines you up 20 yards past the hole. makes no sense.
Its all pay to win now. 4 of 5 different types of microtransactions. 

Dont support this garbage. its a cash grab especially after taking a year off.
I requested a refund. ill wait until its half off to buy it. until then, its not worth it. Big disappointment. I hope EA comes through this spring.",1665728813,1665728813,False,69,3,0.735202908515930176,9,True,False,False

Do you love PGA 2K21? Do you love micro-transactions? Well then, get ready for PGA 2K23! It's more or less the same game as 21, save for a few improvements to the myPlayer system. Your player is much more your own now, with archetypes and skill trees. Gear, and clothing don't effect performance anymore like they use too, instead you get power-ups called fitting that you attach to the various club types. This costs 50-100 credits per club (could be more I have only gotten common quality add-ons so far). It cost 400 credits to fit an entire set of irons 4-9i with a shaft upgrade. A tournament win in career mode got me 250 credits. Coming in roughly 20th place got me zero credits. The club appearances and clothing seem to be slightly more expensive then in 21 but I haven't explored it to much yet as I can hardly afford to upgrade my performance pieces. Also from what I have noticed, your ball can play a huge role in how it rolls, and the ball ""power-up"" only goes for one round, so each round you have to spend your credits on new balls if you want to be competitive.  I also want to mention that I believe they changed the swing to make traditional swinging harder so people opt for the new 3-click system. The new swing type is fine, and accurate but it feels like an arcade game instead of golf.  At first this seemed a bit tedious and grindy, but I enjoy the game-play loop so whatever, more matches, more coins, more gear. Then I noticed that if you right-click when in the pro-shop you get the coveted real-money-store. BOOM! swipe your credit card and you can buy all the credits you need. Ultimately I would probably recommend this game if not for the micro-transactions. That said though with just a few hours in I can 100% promise this game is going to be a slow grindy mess without the use of a credit card. Save yourself some money and simply buy PGA 2K21 or wait for the new EA game coming out. 2K took a good game and turned it into a grifty cash grab. Shame on them.

UPDATE: I unlocked some fancier club upgrades, they cost so much to fit to individual clubs I am once again out of credits. Spent $110 USD to support golf games since we were in drought for a while. I am a sucker.",1665724304,1665724432,False,250,21,0.86920398473739624,0,True,False,False
