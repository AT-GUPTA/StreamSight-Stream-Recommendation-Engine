Grammar and spelling in the English translation are not great, but you can understand the translation (mostly ;-)
When exploring and catching horses, your character name is always ""Rose"" even if you changed it.
I found a bug where your game sometimes crashes when you try to catch horses.

[/spoiler] If you get the perk for discounts at the shops in the charisma talent tree, you can get endless money, energy (action points) and stats by buying endless fertilizer from Jermaine for 112 gold and selling it back to him for 139 gold (for a profit of 27 gold each) when the shops have their yearly sale. You can maximize this gain by maxing all the farming and cooking talents also so that you can harvest more what and make more bread at a time for more AP more quickly. Unfortunately, the quickest way to buy fertilizer from Jermaine is buying 99 at once, which will give you so much favor with Jermaine that you are locked into marrying his son at the end =(. To avoid this, you can do the slower exploit of buying one fertilizer at a time, which won't increase your favor with him.

The game plays well enough on the steam deck, but without controller support, your are forced to use a combo of the touchpad + R2 and touch screen. You can't use the touch screen alone most of the time due to the smaller, more fine text/button options making precise clicking difficult at times. And you can't use the right side touchpad + R2 button ""mouseclick"" for timed reaction events like some festival games due to the more precise, but ultimately slower movement of the cursor.

In short, this game is mainly meant for PC mouse and keyboard, but it is playable on the steam deck version of that with some getting used to.

[GAME REVIEW]
A great and wonderful addition to the Child Raising Sim Genre sparked by the original Princess Maker games. My one gripe about it is that its a little TOO easy. You can get what's supposed to be the most difficult and secret ""True Ending"" on the first try without guides. There is a kind of ""roguelike"" system that you can access after your first ending which will let you customize and add higher starting stats for your next run to make it easier to unlock other endings, but if your most difficult endings can be achieved without this, what's the point? The overarching gameplay itself in that regard needs better balancing.

However, you could also argue that this is what makes the lower or middle tier stat ""difficulty"" endings harder to achieve since it requires you to pay careful attention, making sure you don't raise your daughter's stats in certain areas too much. Despite that, it's still not anything that skill or math heavy. Its pretty much just occasionally looking at a stat and remembering your target number to get a specific ending. With the option to customize your stats on your second run and onwards, this can lead you to already having the desired stat amount and therefore not even needing to look at it for the rest of your run.

The Chinese to English translation isn't the best at times, but its generally understandable for the most part, so I don't have a real problem with it there.

Lastly, other than doing it because of your love and adoration for your utterly adorable daughter, I do think that the other endings are worth going for if you're a completionist like me or just enjoy seeing the story events or corresponding art. The gameplay between these different events and endings isn't very unique so that kills some of the replayability to it however. I found it more enjoyable to replay the game only after taking several week breaks in between play sessions so that I didn't get bored of it. That's not necessarily a bad thing since this is an offline single player game that you can put down or pick up at any time.

All in all, I'd give Volcano Princess a 7.5/10 and say its well worth the full price $11.",1708460443,1708461701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the game introduces JUST SO MANY things that you can do, doesn't explain how to do them really, doesn't offer any kind of priority system or proper incentive to try them out (i feel like having more straightforward quests and more time to really explore them would've been fun), and so you just get swamped with a million options that you keep failing at because you don't get how to do the 'mini games'.

it's kind of like stardew valley with the time crunch and low energy system, but instead of getting piecemeal information, quests to point you to what to do next so you can understand how to play the game properly/in a way that's fun and virtually endless time to try again and again, you get overwhelmed with information, you have no idea what to do next and when to do it, and it goes by SO QUICKLY that trying further feels like a waste of time.

i considered doing a new game and looking through guides online and stuff, but i don't really feel like the time and energy are worth it for a game of this kind, where it's meant to be a simple and cute time, so i'll probably just walk away (also, it'd feel like homework lol, i'm not the kind of person who wants to research for games, i just wanna play them and have a fun time, which very much didn't happen with this game). really sad though, i was looking forward to playing something similar to the mobile games i played as a kid without the annoying microtransactions and ads included.

I usually just turn off the sound if I am there for long. But otherwise, that's just a personal thing. I love everything else about Volcano Princess!

Okay, maybe [b][i]very[/i][/b] addictive.

This is actually my first time playing a ""princess maker"" type game. I saw the positive reviews and figured I would give it a try, but wow, I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. The gameplay doesn't ever really get too dull or boring and the visuals and artwork are pretty great. However, it does get terribly repetitive and sometimes tedious after your first few playthroughs and the game is quite long if you're not just rushing through it. This might discourage you from playing after your first or second playthroughs so the replayability factor is kinda low. I think that's more of a problem with the genre of the game rather than the game itself though. There's only so much you can do with life sims, you know? Otherwise, it's an amazing game. I love it. 

There's also been some negative reviews which complain about the ""horrible English translation"" but as of writing this review, the translation seems fine to me. Yes, there are some grammatical errors and other mistakes here and there but it's never bad to the point where you don't know or can't understand what's happening. I'm not sure where those reviews are coming from lol. It definitely doesn't warrant a negative review.

Volcano Princess is a game that focuses on the relationship between a father and his daughter as they both grow and mature as individuals and as family members. There are lots of endings and even more things to do, but the pacing of this game is best designed for people who want to take their time and immerse themselves in its engaging plot and dynamic characters. It feels more like a story than anything, the only difference is that it is primarily driven by your choices. This has become one of my favorite games; I give it an easy 9/10. This game is worth your money and deserving of your time; but it realistically isn't for everyone. But with all that being said? Please buy this game. Please don't cheat yourself out of a great memory.


I initially typed out my whole review and it was so long and detailed, it cut itself off. So I actually made an entirely separate document to say everything that has to be said. But the important things to know if you don't want the full thing:

- The art, animation, and music is stellar. Like seriously impressive.

- The characters are a delight and very dimensional in motivations and personality.

- Game mechanics are fun and simple to understand.

- Emotionally impactful. LGBTQ+ friendly too if that makes a difference to your judgement of the game.

- The English translation is perfectly legible and understandable, but awkward at times. 

- I beat my first run in about 8.5 - 9 hours. Granted, I took my time. You can speed through in a third of that if you wanted. The replayablity is what forgives its short length for a run.

- If you're looking for replayability, I can imagine that unless you really like this game, want all the achievements, or you want to 100%, you really aren't going to want to keep going after your second or third run.

- Playing on Steam Deck technically works, but not as well as it could. Some awkward controls but technically runs fine, except for one thing. There's a portion of the game that softlocked my Steam Deck OLED, both game and system. The event is in the link to the full review.


Please look at my full review where I talk about the intricacies. It has spoiler protection that can be bypassed by just copying the text or highlighting it with your mouse. It won't take long and it's worth your time, just 7 pages of helpful and passionate review.

This would be a very good game...  If it was in early acess.

Th entire game feels like it's an Alpha. A very playable alpha mind you, but an Alpha. But, most of the game's content feel shallow, or straight up unfinished. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem if this wasn't the type of game that you're expected to have multiple playthoughs, making the cracks be more apparent the more and more you play, making you getting better at it being very unrewarding. 

There are some horrible problems in tutorialization too, some games mechanics are explained differently than what they actually are, almost as if the dev changed how they worked but forgot to change the tutorial text.

Adn the most glaring issue: The translation. It's bad. Like, it's really bad. google translator/literal translation bad.  And given that this is a story driven game, it really hurts your ability appreciate the characters dialogue and their story. For example, there is a character that has difficult speaking. It took my second playthrough to realize that was on purpose and not the translation being bad. 

The translation is also very confusing for the gameplay itself. The same mechancs will be given two different names, sometimes three, making you have to guess what you're even doing.

Which is not to say the game is bad in everything, the art is absolutely gorgeous, there is hundreds of different of beautiful drawn images, there's dozens of endings, dozens of marriage endings, and the game feels engaging enough for the first playthrough, and you get a good attachment to your daughter as she grows up.

So... Yeah. a 6.5/10.

Ps: The dev team is like, 2 people for most of the stuff in it. Which is absolutely insane given the amount of things this game has, as shallow as they may feel. Hopefully with the amount of copies the game sold they can afford to hire a full time dev team, either for a sequel, or to make the current content feel more cohesive and replayable.

Also, for the love of god. I pray they hire a new translator/translation team. The current ones are either scamming the devs, or they are really, really, amateur.

edit: After 6 months of reflecting about this game I realized I was being too kind to it. And after 6 months, with no news on a translation update, or just a.... update to fix the issues regarding shallow or bugged mechanics, I cant on good mind recommend the game.",1689530061,1704910066,False,0,0,0.480238944292068481,0,True,False,False

游玩性方面—比美少女夢工厂2 更多可玩性，街道有地圖，可以聊天、請教、玩牌、調整、送禮物、約會、種菜烹飪回復行動等等。玩完一輪結局后，有畫廊看回戰利品=成就感！（照片），角色也多（更多攻略對象？）比較可惜的是戰鬥方面。

戰鬥方面——過於呆板，只是按罷了？沒有招式畫面（愛神餐館的戰鬥就蠻好的），無法探索地圖……

結局——開放式的結局？自己選？這樣會有一種情況…… 會一直 load game 去按完每一個結局.... hmm 這樣好嗎？感覺有點累呢... 太多的選擇了

操作方面——只能用滑鼠和鍵盤 ctrl/space bar，如果可以用controller就更好了！

額外想法——如果有幾個隱藏角色就更有趣了！（比如美少女夢工廠2去探險時，可以遇到龍，然後可以得到隱藏的龍衣服和最後和龍王子結婚~~）或者隱藏的道具等等之類，更多探索性，可以一直重玩？

Your daughter is very cute and lovely.
This is the game that I won't unlock all endings because why would you want your daughter to be sad, huh??

For the new player.
GAMEPLAY : 4/5
The gameplay is just about clicking and manage your daughter's stamina, choose her studies, make her talk and built relationships with NPCs (that could lead to marriage by some characters or befriend with them and ask them to join your party), clear the dungeon (turn-based), and many more options to choose. 
You also choose for your personality as a father. Strict, Lovely, Kind, Wise, Adorable, Cruel (Why this??).
If you don't like clicking and choices choosing game. Pass this game. But if you love to read and learn about character growth. I super recommend this game.
REPLAYABILITY : 5/5
The replayable is quite large due to many routes, many romance, many ending jobs. 
ART STYLE : 5/5 
The style of art is Japanese-visual novel style. Every character design is great.
STORY : 4/5
Some of the story still conflict and there's plot hole.(But not much) 
CONTENT : 4/5
Some of the contents is the same with others. Clicking and clicking and choose the best choice.
Some content required too high status, so you can't do it in your first playthrough. 
DAUGHTER : lovable/5
No need to tell. My daughter must be happy.

OVERALL : Daughter/5 
Buy this game. It's worth your time and every penny.

Now, with that out of the way, overall it's a very cute, tamagochi-style game where you take care of your virtual daughter in order to bring her up as an outstanding member of the society (or not, it's up to you). Mine became astronomically rich on top of having two boyfriends at the same time, so I felt a great sense of accomplishment. You go girl. Everything is clear and manageable even without a guide thats usually mandatory to follow for these types of games, as well as being pleasantly light on creepy subtext. Not to say it's completely nonexistant, though, but nothing that destroys the sweet fluffy cuteness of the visuals.
At the same time, I'm always puzzled by how the player takes on the role of a father yet also you play as the daughter and then date all kinds of people as her.

Knowing I will have to start the turn all over again because it doesn't save at any time other than the beginning of each turn? It becomes frustrating. Obviously I haven't let it stop me for the most part as I am 31 hours in and will continue playing it when I'm less frustrated that I just wasted all that time to have it not save... 

But despite that little frustrated rant, this is a good game. Some typos in the English translation, but that has never bothered me in all the different otome and visual novel games I've played.

I played ALOT of Princes Maker 2 and adored it so I was very excited to see a similar game release in modern times. Art is beautiful and the world much more fleshed out then the game it resembles. Also has much more in depth friendship system though I really wish there was more character events then there currently is. This game also has a longer play style then Princess Maker. 1 full playthrough took me about a full day or a estimated 7 hours which is a BIG difference from the quicker playthroughs that Princess Maker generally had. That is if your going for the bigger endings.

I must mention the translation for this game is a somewhat bad. Most of the time I can understand whats being said and happening but during the larger story reveal the bad translations made following far harder. I don't think its bad enough to drag the game down as I still enjoyed it a lot even with the errors but its something to be aware of. The beginning cutscene particularly is bad but it gets much better throughout the game in my opinion.

The story overall is alot of fun, though I feel a weird about the fact that she can end up with the adults or her own professors. But you don't have to unless your 100 percenting the game and the gameplay really is fun so I can let it go. Its easy to make sure this doesn't happen just be sure your chosen love interest has the most relationship points. Though if the others reach a certain level as well you may get a dejected letter from other characters in the ending, but that's easy enough to skip through. 

Would definitely recommend I'm already on my third play through and still having a blast. If you enjoy the Princess Maker series this is absolutely worth the price.

-Without a guide, it was very hard to successfully get endings

Art is gorgeous, and I REALLY appreciate that the game allows you to pick MULTIPLE endings, and has stat decrease items to achieve even more endings in one save. I loved the story! It was very cute despite some of the flaws I saw in it's narrative.

So are there any problems? Yes. 

1) The English translation is NOT good. Sometimes I can barely understand what was happening. In fact, I didn't even know time looping was a thing until someone on a forum mentioned it to me. The English translation doesn't read like real people are speaking. As another example; I had difficulty telling whether Kenneth could REALLY not speak well, or if it was just the translation struggling to portray someone socially awkward. The translation NEEDS to be redone at some point, because there exist many english speakers who refuse to buy this game because the translation is so bad. 

2) The plot has some holes because the protagonist (your daughter) is only an observing party until the very end of the game. You see, aside from the fathers memories.... the plot goes on without the player almost entirely in the background. And infact, one could argue that the plot is more about the mother, father and three lords... Not the daughter. And this is a problem; because there is a specific plot point concerning her father... where the daughter SHOULD'VE been actively searching for a cure, but never did. She instead just keeps it a secret, and lets the three lords figure it out themselves while she lived life completely normally. And this caused narrative problems in the story, as certain plot points remain unclear which would've otherwise made sense if the daughter was actually involved in the plot.

3) I loved the characters, they just didn't have enough involvement in the story for me to feel much attachment. Other than the lords, only Nina is the only other reoccurring character in the plot. Every other character fundamentally doesn't matter, as they are not at all involved in the story and their events are completely optional.
Characters such as Kenneth, Hackett and Ze had a LOT of potential for additional story points; but that potential is never actually explored or realised in the game.

----

In summary: LOVE THIS GAME! It's an upgrade over the 'Princess Maker series' despite its flaws. However, I would like to someday see a better english translation, and perhaps some DLC concerning characters like Kenneth, Ze and Hackett. I feel like having them be the individual protagonist of their own mini episode would flesh out and get players more attached to their characters.

If this devloper makes any future games, I hope that that they make the daughter more involved in the plot. And I hope for some more fantasy characters(Let us marry a demon lord!) and more fantasy endings.

You played as ""Wood"" the father. The end game is to raise your daughter ""Rose"", guide her to various decision and watch her as she slowly transition from child to adulthood. You raising your daughter by balancing the resource, mostly Money and Action Point, to allocate your daughter stats, relationship with NPC, romancing marriage candidates both boys and girls, juggling your daughter moods, choosing which class she goes, horse racing, cooking, fight street thug, fight monster, fight demon, fight your friend, fight god, play dress up, meet important people, play dice, went acting, do alchemy, do math, and etc.... 

With these much variety ways (side gameplay) of raising your daughter, the good news here is you won't have to deal with these all at once. The game did a pretty good job introducing and getting used to them as the time goes.

At it's core, Volcano Princess is a visual novel with a couple of mini games littered in between. Whatever decision you pick will slow affect your virtual daughter over the course of 8-12 hrs and where she will ended up. The game has many replayability. Many endings and loads of save slot at your disposal. RNG does influence the result from time to time. Save scumming can be an option for completionist. But I would recommend to go blind and try many mechanic this tiny game has to offer for the first run, then you can start doing min-maxing later.

Voice acting is great, with both original Chinese and recently Japanese. Despite mostly limited to important sentence and your daughter. I'm not proficient at both language so I might be wrong, but I can feels the character well. The music well suited the game theme, usually clam and serene with an alright action music when things get heated in fight. The art is real good and consistence through most game some really beg to have a thumbnail or wallpaper. The mugshot and chibi icon really cute. Although, I kinda do wish all the NPC, beside Nina, can have more art or sprite as a children to grow along with the daughter to create some sense of time passing, otherwise everyone just look static (either teenager and adult) through out the whole game.

Unlike Princess Maker, however, Volcano Princess is safe for all devoted christian and all age which ever decision you may choose. :)

To end the review, I overall gave this game 8/10. The only complain is that I felt the ""True Ending"" is a bit underwhelming, coming from me a PM fans, the way of achieving wise. And with 8-12 hrs per game is about OK, I do prefer a more arcade feels 3-5 hrs of PM 2 and 3 of a full play through (I'm looking at you PM5... I'm not a very save scummy person when it comes to this kind of game, but with a realistic pacing of 40+ hrs per playthough with many many possible ending!!? I know you would love to be the most comprehensive raising daughter game ever but come on now!). 

Some may complain about the english translation quality. While, yes, it does have some issues, mostly to do with conveying the emotion (lost in translation?). The text clipped off the textbox from time to time. I personally found the English does it job for the most part. They honestly did a much better job than CFK's Princess Maker half-arse translation, which sometimes do affect the game play in significant way. But here what we have is perfectly fine for the most part.

Other than that, this game is a blast to go through. It makes you care and anticipate whatever in game NPC interaction can makes you overall feels good and real relax game. I'm happy for what I'm getting and a kind of game I can casually come back from time to time. :)",1696918067,1702128041,True,5,0,0.567567586898803711,0,True,False,False

You play as a father raising a young daughter - but she quickly goes from a cute youngster to a teenager with a lot of life lessons to learn. I like the variety of activities and mini-games you can play, which mix-up the game play a bit. Some of them are more fun than others. It's a little annoying that ""dueling"" and ""debating"" are completely input free after selecting them and the text scrolls past too fast to read, and the horse beauty pageant minigame is pretty tedious. On the other hand, exploring and dungeon-crawling are so fun it's hard to not splurge all your  action points in one place and keep a focus on the rest of the game. There are a LOT of potential love interests, but so far all the romance storylines have been sweet and wholesome. The game does contain some dark twists, depending on the path you take, but so far nothing has come across as problematic - just evil people doing evil stuff that the game KNOWS is evil stuff and doesn't get graphic with. 

It does take a relatively long time to complete a playthrough and the saving system means it's harder to effectively branch playthroughs. I also wish there were options to skip through cutscenes you've already seen. I don't want to hear the backstories of every person I befriended for the purposes of bashing monsters every single time I play.

anyways, if anything happens to my daughter i will go berserk. get this game if you're looking for something casual bc it's pretty worth it :D

Management is key with what crops you plant what job you get, what skills you train, and of course where to spend your ""energy"" on. You can befriend everybody in one playthrough but of course you can only end up with one of them. The Characters are unique with their own storylines and half of which are romance-able.

This is a very detailed game. There is a good variety of NPCs and I like the interactions with them, whether it's the ones you can befriend or the background ones that just appear every once in a while to make some amusing, disturbing, or mysterious comments. There is such good depth to the conversations that you get a different script when you talk with the NPC on a different day. Some of them comment on certain items in your inventory and changes in your attributes or fame, while some react to different outfits! 

An interesting aspect of this game is how it approaches career endings. It's trickier to find the mediocre ones. I enjoyed the challenge of going for them! With that in mind, I still very much recommend this to any achievement hunters. Though some achievements could be trickier, I found that they are definitely achievable. I found it more difficult to complete the [b]Gallery[/b] and [b]Collection Room[/b] because many of them rely on chance and thus require reloads unless you have the patience and time to go through multiple playthroughs to see if they would trigger without reloading. 

Some things that could use improvement in the game are fixing the items and achievements that are labelled wrongly and fixing the wrong descriptions for some of the goals and achievements in the game. You can see the item label issue with some of the paintings whose labels don't match what is depicted.

Overall, I highly recommend this game for casual players, achievement hunters, and completionists who enjoy raising simulator games. I purchased this game with a 15% discount (9.34 USD) but I think this game is worth its full price or perhaps even more. This has a lot of replay value since you need three playthroughs to work with the three different Knight Paths. It took me five playthroughs to get everything I wanted in the game. Even for just my first playthrough which took me 13 hours, I think it was a good purchase with what I paid and how long I played the game.",1701150007,1701150007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, it was not perfect.

Pros:

Music - The music in Volcano Princess is something I'm certainly going to be hunting for on streaming services!

Characters - All the characters are well written and diverse, making them all fun to talk to.

Art - Volcano Princess's art is... stunning. Especially the cut scene art.

Story - I've only played through once, but the story left me longing for more. (although it is a NG+ game)

Cons:

English Translations - The English translations for Volcano Princess are spotty, with some parts being much worse than the others. However, it was always clear what was trying to be said!

A little repetitive - Volcano Princess can be a little grindy, but I don't think this is one of its major faults. It makes up for it through the story and I didn't even fully use the battle mechanism's that come with leveling up strength.


In the end, Volcano Princess is a game I will hold close to my heart. Seeing my Lillia grow up was a wonderful experience and I both dreaded and longed for the end. If you're looking for a game to calm yourself down and cool off, this is the perfect game for it. The art, music, and story make it easily one of my favorite games here on Steam. In my opinion, it was worth every cent.

10/10. Wonderful experience. Would 100% play again.

To echo the actual store page description, the player assumes the role of the father of the lovely little angel Rose (I went with the default given name in my first playthrough) and by his actions [spoiler](and her own later on in life)[/spoiler], will shape what kind of woman she grows into come adulthood. There are actually a fair number of endings present, which I will gloss on slightly a bit later.

[h3]PROS:[/h3]
+ The simplicity of [i]starting[/i]. The game begins fairly easily, with mechanics being easy to understand - it’s mostly point-and-click throughout. However, the depth of Volcano Princess lies with all the various ways of growing Basic and Core attributes, developing Natural Skills and relationships with the various townspeople, and even acquiring hidden conditions (called “Darkness”) when nurturing Rose. Essentially, every action taken is factored into how the ending will turn out. Because of how free the player is in deciding their virtual daughter’s future, Rose can actually become either a very good, or very bad person. Though, why would you ever want the latter, goodness gracious. [b]EDIT (26.11.21):[/b] It is a very easy game to get into, and does well to draw you in after just a short while.

+ The gorgeous artwork is one of the game’s biggest draws. Very adorable and lovely, and the various scenes spaced throughout the main and relationship stories are nicely done too.

+ At the start of each day, the player is able to interact with Rose before she begins her daily adventures, with the frequency increasing as she matures. In fact, she is actually fully voiced for all these interactions. As of writing this, there are currently choices for either Japanese or Chinese voices. [b]EDIT (26.11.21):[/b] It really helps immerse and endear the player to the game, listening to the sweet voice of their daughter each morning.

+ The music is sweet. As expected of a game of this genre, it is calming, with fantasy tones befitting the setting. The various ambience presented is fairly soothing and relaxing to listen to on loop, in some areas.

+ Developing relationships will influence the end game. Not simply who her future spouse(s) will be, but if I’m not mistaken, it is also factored into what sort of career Rose will have. There exists a decent range of interesting characters from various tropes whom Rose can interact with and befriend. Some offer her jobs, others sell her clothing or equipment, and of course there are also those who can be recruited to join her party for explorations.

+ The English translation is fairly good, with only minor inaccuracies in certain dialogues. And it’s not all incorrect per se either, just, not the most impactful to use at times.

+ [b]EDIT (26.11.21):[/b] Newly added this. There is a mechanic unlocked after completing your first playthrough which aids in speeding up future runs. At the games conclusion, you are given an amount of Firestone (amount is dependent on how well you met the goals previously), which can be used to boost Rose's starting attributes, skills, and relationships in future games. Thus, reducing some amount of the early game grind.

[h3]NEUTRALS:[/h3]
+/- There isn’t much explanation of an overall, overarching story currently, despite it being sort of hinted at in the prologue, and here and there throughout the game’s progress. While there are pieces of lore fillers, it currently lacks a cohesive structure. This could be a feature expanded upon by the developers, on a later date. Or even be the premise for a second title in the series? I hope so, either way.

+/- There is a simple combat system in place which is only available when one chooses the Explore option while at the Forgotten Valley. Fairly straightforward and not tedious. It is a direct turn-based system, where Rose's party is allocated a certain amount of AP each turn. She would have to choose which skills to use, and where to target them, each with various effects and cooldowns. Successfully managing AP and building a versatile party composition is necessary to emerge victorious in explorations. Successfully completing quests will advance Rose’s Knight Career, something which gets introduced pretty early in the story, and can influence the ending as well. [b]EDIT (26.11.21):[/b] Move this to a neutral, as the very minimalist system may either serve to interest or disinterest the player, depending on their personal preference. And provided some additional explanation about the combat system.

+/- If you are a completionist, then you will be playing this game for a long, long while, considering the vast multitude of endings. However, if you’re the sort to enjoy that, or just adore the simple fact of raising a child like Rose, then I suppose this is actually a very big [b]PRO[/b] instead. [b]EDIT (26.11.21):[/b] Move this to a neutral.

[h3]CONS:[/h3]
- None thus far. At least, in my subjective opinion.

[h2]VERDICT:[/h2]
A very wholesome take on the life sim genre, Volcano Princess will charm you with its lovely main character and delightful setting. You’ll be relaxing and spending quite a bit of time exploring the various ways to go about parenting darling Rose. Will you be an awesome father or a lame dad? And at the end, you might even shed some genuine tears once she's all grown up.",1700706015,1700968311,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Just like a perfectly golden batch of fries, this game has left me sizzling with excitement.

First things first, let's talk about the flavor of the game – and oh la la, it's a spicy one! From the moment I dipped my digital self into the molten world of Volcano Princess, I was greeted by a visually stunning landscape that's as enticing as a golden, crispy exterior. The graphics are so hot, they're practically on fire, and the attention to detail is as meticulous as the seasoning on a fine plate of French fries.

Now, let's talk about gameplay – the heart and soul of any game, just like salt is to a French fry. Volcano Princess serves up a delectable blend of platforming and puzzle-solving that keeps you coming back for more. The controls are as smooth as the creamiest ketchup, making it easy for players of all skill levels to enjoy the adventure.

The narrative is the secret sauce that ties everything together. The story unfolds with the grace of a perfectly executed saute, keeping players engaged and eager to discover what lies beyond the next fiery ridge. The characters are as diverse and flavorful as a basket of assorted fries – each with their own unique charm and backstory that adds layers to the overall experience.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention, much like the seasoning on a truffle oil-infused parmesan fry. The music complements the game like a fine wine pairing, enhancing the immersive feel of the volcanic world. It's a symphony of sizzles and pops that adds a dash of excitement to every step of the adventure.

And let's not forget the replay value – a crucial factor, just like the desire for a second helping of fries. With hidden secrets, multiple endings, and a variety of gameplay styles, Volcano Princess ensures that players will be coming back for seconds, thirds, and more.

In conclusion, Volcano Princess is a feast for the senses, much like a plate of perfectly seasoned French fries. It's a game that not only satisfies the craving for a spicy adventure but also leaves you wanting more. So, grab your digital ketchup, dive into the molten world, and enjoy the crunchy goodness that is Volcano Princess! 🍟✨",1695599189,1700705818,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Found it while browsing through games, Saw that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive... game was pretty cheap so decided to give it a go. So glad i did! So much love and passion has been put into this hidden gem. 19 hours of gameplay in 2 days hehe.

The gameplay: Is very simple yet still has depth to it with management. Interacting with other people in the world and befriending them by talking, gifting and going on friendly dates with them. Each character has there own story and are fleshed out very well. There are horse riding events to do, Theatre, Bathhouse and a dice mini game. There is a dungeon/adventure part of the game that involves combat which has a bit of strategy involved to survive and get the best rewards/fame. There is kind of a NG+ feature once you complete it for the 1st time. So when starting a new game (fresh run) you can boost some of your stats for that run.

The Graphics: The artstyle is very beautiful and well coloured. Lots of CG's to unlock and view (Once you complete the game once) Not many animated scenes but not really necessary imo. 

Verdict: This game was quite amazing. Nice slice of life sim that will put a smile on your face. 19 hours for my 1st playthrough and looking forward to starting another for more achievements. At full price (It's not that expensive anyways) it's so worth it <3

However, there was a single drawback: the absence of Steam sync. Transitioning between PCs became a tad frustrating, as my progress didn't seamlessly carry over.

    If you buy this game you will be able to enjoy it for hours provided you do not get burnt out from the repetitiveness. Your goal in the game is to raise/guide your daughter until she is an adult. Making her study/engage in different activities will influence her attributes. A different combination of attributes or level of these attributes will determine her adult life. Every day make sure you plan what you want to do to make her the happiest (or not)! There seems to be not only many different endings but also different romance pairing endings depending on how your daughter’s attributes are built(can romance both boy and girl and poly ending). There are also many items you can unlock after beating the game. There is a gallery with a collection just 100% this game will take a lot of hours. This leaves you with many hours of enjoyment getting your money back. However this can lead to burnt out. The relative structure of each playthrough and some events are fixed, what will be different is the different way you want to guide your daughter. Do you want her to be more combat focused? Or maybe guide her to be a lady? Do this by choosing different knight paths at the beginning of her school years and choosing different activities. Players who play VNs, or other life sim type games or games with life sims aspects (persona, fire emblem three houses) are familiar with this repetition but can get tiring if played for too long. I often felt myself going onto autopilot when playing for a long session forgetting that even though I was focused on trying to complete one goal I was ignoring the other important stats. I would advise you to take a break. (also thank God for the skip button for multiple playthroughs!!) 
   The translation from chinese to english is really not the best but playable. You can definitely tell it was translated literally from chinese at some places. You can get the general idea of the main story and what the characters are saying. Lore from NPC or friendship candidates events will give more background into the setting. The events are nice and some are cuter/have a more romantic undertone than the others. You do feel bad when high friendship characters send you a sad letter when you pick another person over them to marry. Even though it took a lot to process what was happening in the true story due to the unclear translation I can get the idea but I am still a little confused by it but I do not think this game is played for the main story anyways.  Before when you start there is little tutorial text you can read and after there are little question marks you can mouse over if you do not understand some parts of the gameplay or stats but this game does not handhold you. I liked being able to play the game/figure out how the game works for me.
You might also need a walkthrough to get all the endings or if you beat the game once the archive will tell you what stats are needed to unlock that career path. I would advise you to use the note feature on the steam overlay and write down which career path you are aiming for and the requirements.

[b]CREEPY DAD SECTION?[/b]
Those who are wary about playing as a Dad well once your daughter turns to a teen I believe you are playing as both characters the Dad and the daughter. Especially during the in town segments you are playing as the daughter. (I think we are the daughter because the Dad does not know the daughter’s friends even if we give her pocket money it disappears from the UI…). So I like the idea that we are guiding the daughter now instead of raising her. She is free to choose her own path, the Dad is not forcing her. I did not feel creepy at all at being a Dad character and felt the daughter was more self insert than the Dad. Secondly, the Dad really loves the Mom from what I can understand from the true ending and the home part of the end game bonuses section. The game did not influence me at all to be a real Dad except maybe at the end a little at the end XI JINPING SORRY!

[b]Conclusion[/b] 
Volcano Princess is a good game that is worth the price for the time you can play. While this game can have a lot of repetition there is a lot of replay value with the different career paths and knight path you can choose and different stat routes. If the English translation was professionally proficient (this is something that can change, hopefully fixed in the future!), I could see this game becoming bigger in the West with streamers. Buy this game if you like life sims with many different endings and things to unlock, good art and a lot of soul and heart put into it!

But if you can look beyond that, there's a surprisingly deep story hidden here that goes well beyond the standard ""life milestones and daddy feelings"" that you can get from any daughter-raising sim. Likewise, some of the interactions you can have with other villagers as you get to know them are genuinely touching.

It might not seem like much is going on at first, but if you know the genre tropes and start following them early, you can get the true ending in the first playthrough (that said, the true ending is probably even better with a certain romance path which might not be obvious.)

Some of the game's systems fall short for me (certain special event mini-games are a good idea but not great execution) but all in all I was pleasantly surprised at how this game breathes new life into a framework that's been done so many times, even the recent Princess Maker games are falling flat.

There's plenty to do, the writing is enjoyable, and the art is beautiful.

Like the original English release of Princess Maker, the translation is occasionally charmingly wobbly, but I always understood what it was trying to say - it's mostly some characters and places having a few variant spellings of their names (e.g. Lon/Ron, Alan/Ellen).

If you're an ending collector like me, the game helpfully lets you pick from the best ending of each ""type"" you qualify for, which is a great quality of life feature. Maybe my daughter does want to spend her entire childhood fighting monsters and then retire to become an amateur actress. The 35 hours I've clocked at the moment is four ""full"" runs of the game, plus some reloading to see different ending variations.",1697898119,1697898119,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A very relaxing and cute game. There are so many ways to raise the daughter and so many things to do in volcanic country, that it's overwhelming. She can turn into a criminal or a queen, depending on your choices. She can romance anyone, even from the same sex, as well as have polygamous relationships. The game is full of choices, content, and heart.

Unfortunately, there are some significant flaws in the game. The biggest of these (and the cause of a lot of issues) is the not-so-good translation of the game. It can cause misunderstandings about the gameplay instructions, make the dialogue feel uninteresting (which can make the game feel a bit draggy), and it makes the game feel very rough around the edges. Due to a lot of mistranslated text, some mechanics (like the dice game) are impossible to understand. 

If you want to play a wholesome game with a lot of great content, art, mechanics, and choices (and dialogue), this will fit perfectly. It is very playable even with the bad translation, it just keeps the game from being a masterpiece.",1695968826,1695969342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While Volcano Princess is a small game in literal storage size, it's a huge feast of wholesomeness and enjoyment.  The game is all about min-maxing your daughter as her sole parent and watching her progress as she grows up.  It's such a simple concept done [i]so well[/i].  Egg Hatcher (devs) should be proud of this outstanding game.

As for pros and cons
+ A bit of everything; combat, intellect, romance, sorcery...
+ The art is pleasing to the eye, and there's no shortage of art to discover.
+ A generally like-able character set.  I couldn't bring myself to dislike any of the characters. [spoiler]Hacket and Ze have their issues, but still likeable[/spoiler]
+ Significant, widespread depth: Volcano Princess isn't the best at anything it does, but it's the best at combining all of them into a single game.
+ Quality of Life controls, so you aren't trapped reading the same dialogue over and over.
+ Each of the three main paths for the game do actually feel different when replaying.  Going for a charisma build is quite a bit different than brute forcing via a strength build.
+ Entertaining minigames and interesting ""challenge-sequences"", with a lot of flavor text to help flesh out what are essentially stat-checks.
+++ Incredibly wholesome father-daughter moments.  Many parts genuinely had me smiling out of happiness.
- The English Translation could use some proofreading by a native English-speaker.  Not really that bad.
- Some mechanics could use better explanation, such as ""fame"", which can be freely spent at the church without damaging ending potentials (not 100% on this, please comment if I am incorrect).
- Horse crash.  The first time you open the menu to catch a horse, the game crashes.  This should be an easily preventable issue, and had me stay away from the game for a while after... before coming back.
- Exploitable/missing mechanics.  Magic materials are pointless, sell them to the smith for extra cash.  [spoiler]Food and fertilizer are stupid powerful, need a cooldown on purchases[/spoiler]
-? Not much in terms of negative outcomes, only a handful that can really be called bad... granted, a few of them are [i]really[/i] bad.
-? Age gap... Depending on who you are and what you think of the setting, the age gap can be an issue for some romance paths (worst case is like 24 to 18, not outrageous but certainly questionable for modern standards).
+? Saves begin at the beginning of each turn only, essentially preventing save-scumming.
+? Japanese translation is decent, though that's coming from a non-native Japanese speaker.

Overall, I'd give this game a 9.5/10, with it very likely reaching 10/10 with updates to the localization and tooltips. Worth double its default price.  Get a copy for a friend who needs some wholesomeness in their life.

Seriously though, I am just deleting that Princess Maker remake or whatever from my wishlist after playing this. This has to be the best of the genre at this point.

There is a ridiculous attention to detail in this game. From subtle changes to the backdrops based on season and choices you make, down to the fact that every NPC says something different every in-game day, everything shows the heart that went into this game.

If you do not know this series you might be wondering why am I bringing up an entirely different game franchise when making a review about Volcano Princess.

You see, Volcano Princess is sorta a spiritual sequel to the Princess Maker series. A franchise of games where a father (you) obtains a daughter in some way and has to do his best to keep her safe and so that she grows up into a wonderful woman that will find her way through life.

I am not gonna go into too much detail about the mechanics and such as I feel figuring them out is half of the experience here but yes, this is basically Princess Maker 6.

Sadly similarly to Princess Maker series, it has a pretty bad English translation. If you cannot deal with that, then this might not be a game for you. It also has a rather strange saving system where you can only save at the start of the month. There is also a lot of RNG to combat, especially in the final dungeon where your daughter and her companions can just get stunned to death or instantly gibbed by certain enemies.

But, everything else is basically positive. When I played the game I have truly felt not just for my daughter Sylvie, but also for her father Fin (me) and all of the people of the Volcano Country. Where Princess Maker games kinda fail is secondary NPCs and Volcano Princess truly shines here. I will probably remember some of the people here forever, honestly.

Music is wonderful, only had one crash in an entire playthrough that I streamed over at my Twitch channel and generally the game plays well.

You can see the entire playthrough over at my Youtube channel, just look up Volcano Princess Fingusa and you should be able to see for yourself.

Thank you, developers. You have made a wonderful game and should be proud.",1693909211,1693909211,True,94,1,0.875942051410675049,0,True,False,False

This game would arranged different career paths at the end based on your choices, you could also develop relationships with different npc (even lesbian relationship are available) which is sounds very wide-ranging.
I've played another similar Chinese life sim game called Chinese Parents, which both has similar objectives to raise the children, but the difference is this game has more diverse choice and combined the combat element like rpg which is very rare to see it on a life sim game. 
Plus, once you unlock more endings you will unlock the true ending and understand the origin of the story. I think this game is quite fun to play when you're a fan of simulation or life sim games or even stories lovers.

Main story's tantalizing, you definitely have to play through more than once. It's fun to see all the different endings, I'm probably going to 100% this. I do wish it had a better skip feature for the sake of completionists - you can skip dialogue, but certain kinds of mini-cutscenes aren't skipable. 

Only a few complaints! There are the occasional spelling errors, the kind that's expected with a translated game. Still, it would've been nice if they'd gotten someone else to give things a once-over. At least decide if Lon's name is Lon or Ron. 

I also wish you could go back and see the latest dialogue. I've accidentally skipped things I wanted to go back and read. 

They do a good job of walking you into how everything works for the most part. I didn't understand right away how combat was supposed to work because some attacks you click on and then select an enemy (even if it's an attack at all enemies) and some you click and they automatically do damage. 

None of the romanceable characters are too shallow or one-dimensional, but there is also room for improvement with them as well. Still, they're likeable, and I love seeing them interact with each other.

Cons:  The English translation isn't the greatest and can lead to some mistakes when choosing dialogue lines.  The mini-games don't feel fully explained or were just awkward with no muscle memory to apply, and I whiiffed on most of them.  

Pros:  I usually play adult games and this came up on my feed and it is NOT an adult game (No I didn't expect it to be, but it was recommended based on my games played, which I thought was weird).  It's a cute child-raising game where you essentially level up the daughter and prepare her for life.   The artwork is great and the story was fairly engaging and cute.  There is a game + where you can buff up your stats to replay and get additional endings.

Word of warning, it's possible to achieve endless action points (the ability to do things in your turn), and when you purchased from the blacksmith dude... you build a relationship with him that ends up with the daughter marrying the son, at least in some scenarios, so word of warning.  I was disappointed when I discovered it and had no way to cut it off.

A key thing for ending are the attributes of stamina, mind, and charisma.   Lessons and a few other things help to build.  You also have other stats like strength, imagination, Emotional intelligence (I assume), and something else.   These determine how easy your lessons will be and are also gating elements for jobs and maybe other things every time you level those states, you get to upgrade your skills which makes the game easier.

I'd say a second play-through is required because I'll be surprised if someone plays with zero errors due to the translation.  Still, it is mostly understandable and enjoyable.

time played:  21 hours first play through although about three-four hours was building up cash/action points and massively building up stats as much as I could.  I still have a few more endings to do before my play-through, 

Value?:   I'd say yes either on sale or not.  I think it went on sale and that's why I pulled the trigger, but I'm not 100%.   Either way it is worth it.

So, do I recommend it?  Yes.   I purchased it on a whim because I wanted something different, and this worked well.  Check out other reviews and the images to make sure this type of game would appeal to you, but if you are interested based on my description of some gameplay elements (not going to cover all of them as there are quite a few and it depends on your paths) then I'd say to go for it.",1691895615,1691895615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly started this game as a joke. I saw it multiple times on steam and always ignored it because from the images it didn't tell me much. But then I decided to try it, and boy if I regret not playing it earlier...
The images literally transmit NOTHING of the whole essence of the game.

I wasn't really expecting much from the start, nonchalantly opening it and putting my friend's name as my Daugher's name for some laugh, then the game hits you with ""What kind of Father do you want to be?"", giving you three choices.
From those three choices you understand that there's way more in this game than just a cute chilly game with cute arts.
It's a whole constructed RPG.
There's everything: fighting, duels, entertainment, games with dices, race with horses, taming, relationships, bonds, houses (as in royalty, or take Harry Potter), customization both of clothes and the room, routes, skill trees, the ""darkness"" ([i]when you walk away[/i], literally), multiple endings and secret endings (that's what the game tells you about the darkness).
It's so damn full of stuff that I really was. not. expecting at all.

Like I said I started this game as a joke, it was around 11pm, after a bit of playing, without noticing it was already 3am. ""A little bit more and then I'll go to sleep""; two hours later at 5am+ my homie reaching for me ""Please go to sleep""
""Soon™"".

The first playthrough is gonna be a bit confusing, for me at least it was. Might it be the late hours or the overload of some informations, but I didn't understand some things at first, and I've failed the father's goal TWICE, but it's fine because the replayability of this game is definitely high and I'm gonna go for it again; like I said there's multiple endings and routes and decisions to take, and it doesn't seem like doable doing both the fighter and the royalty route together for obvious reasons.

The story of the game may seems pretty blant at first but I think it's deeper than what it feels like. Playing the role of the Father and watching your Daughter growing, learning how life can be harsh; in fact almost everytime you're doing something for the first time, you're going to fail. You're sad about that, but that's just life, and in the end, just like the Daughter do, think about the food and move on, because it's going to get better and you're gonna improve. This is definitely what this game shows and it does it pretty well. 
There's more in the whole story itself but I still don't know because I'm writing my first impression after my first ending, but there is and it does sound interesting.
The OSTs are good, very comfy and chill. The art is really cute and good at the same time.

I feel like this game will receive many more patch notes; I've seen people saying the english translation is bad, and sometimes it is indeed a bit strange. But they're definitely improving it because it doesn't sound as bad as people make it sound.

In the end I would say this game it's definitely worth its price, if you see it and you're not convinced by it from the images on steam (like I was), try it. If you're scared you can always refund it and two hours are enough to understand if you like it or not; if you notice them go by.",1688310304,1691190664,True,111,1,0.90188288688659668,0,True,False,False

I played that game to death back in the day, and I'm so happy to find a game that is worthy not of just being a successor but even better than it. In the game, you raise your daughter. It sounds simple, but the game is a complex fabric of planning your daughter's interactions, which kind of interactions she should have, the skills she should develop, her mood, her fame, her 'darkness', your wealth, and how many action points you have for the day. There are numerous possible endings and a New Game+ mode in which you can increase your daughter's starting stats. See how your actions affect her future and her future selves as you raise ... well, whomever you want.

I can't praise this game enough. The gameplay is fantastic, with six mini-games to play as well (combat, mathematics game, two different dice games, horse racing, and a 'painting' game). The audio is adorable, although only available in Chinese and Japanese. The art is charming, memorable, and consistently high quality. My single complaint would be that the English localization is slightly rough around the edges in some places, e.g. ""don' t"" instead of ""don't"" and some NPC name spelling inconsistencies. You'll be too busy farming, stuffing your daughter's face with bread, racing horses, keeping her from being evil, and battling monsters in the forest to notice. You'll get a sense of fulfillment out of seeing your plans succeed and your daughter reach your goals all the while developing relationships with more than a dozen NPCs.

HOWEVER! there are a few caveats.
-Steam description is quite misleading. According to it, this is a parenting simulation, where you play the father, and your actions only indirectly influence daughter's life. And this is true - for a first chapter of a game. But then it quickly switches to directly controlling daughter, who essentially became the PC, with father mostly doing the side jobs on a backstage. This throws down the immersion, and kinda takes the most interesting part from the promise.
-This is a translated game, and it shows. It handles simple conversations and descriptions pretty fine, but even after careful re-reading I still have only a vague understanding of what was the truth behind the main plot mystery. 
-Gameplay, while not difficult, is quite... esotheric. There are multiple sub-systems which are related in a non-intuitive way, like Strength and Endurance belonging to two entirely different systems of stats. This can (and will) be quite hard to comprehend. For example despite heavily focusing on Combat path, winning Royal Tournament, finishing all the adventures numerous times, having great martial stats and completing hell of a lot of combat-orientated courses, I wasn't offered any half-descent military career in the ending. Which might be realistic, but is still frustrating.
...but in the end, all of it doesn't matter. 
What does matter is that this game made me care. Made me worry. Made me try really hard to get the best result.
Made me cry.
Made me call my ma, and for once express her how much I love her, how grateful I am to her for all she has done for me.

Ok, Volcano Princess. Before I bought it, I don't have any clue about this game, but this game kept appearing on my recommendation so I gave it a try. My first impression on playing this game was ""oh, maybe this is some kind of otome game that I read in novel/manga/manhwa, I'll just try for below 2 hours before sleep and then refund it laa"". At that time I don't have high expectation for this game, then I stopped playing not because it's near 2 hours threshold, I stopped because sunlight already appears on my window.

From the very first minutes, the game's beautiful music instantly drew me in, creating a captivating ambiance. The interaction between the daughter and the father is very sweet, the progression is reinforcing. I really like how I, as a father in this game try to min max my daughter but still keeping her happy because there is a penalty if the daughter's mood is below 50. By playing this game, you could watch the progression of your daughter from childhood to adult, and most of your decision in nurturing her would affect the ending. 

The romanceable characters in this game is a lot, from typical otome game male lead to Mark the regular guard. Even there is a yuri ending here, so there are many options that you could choose. 

The negative aspect of this game is, the save system. It only save your data at the beginning of the month, even if you save your data in the middle of your activities. So it's frustrating if you want to stop playing, but you still in the middle of your activities. 

In conclusion, Volcano Princess delivers an emotionally satisfying journey alongside a developing daughter .

This game has new game plus mode which is much easier to get any ending your want.

There is no way to lose this game. [spoiler] Even you just skip everything, you can still get the unemployed ending. [/spoiler]
If you want to complete your gallery, you need some grind and clever planning for save-loading.

【Story】
☐ It'll replace your life
☑ Good
☐ Average
☐ Some lore
☐ No Story

The main story is average, especially you may not know what happened until you get the true ending.
But the main story is not the most important part, your daughter is most important.
How she interacts with the world and grow up with friends are more interesting.

Romance endings are my favorite because it does not limit which character you daughter can fall in love with.
I am surprised when I get [spoiler] harem yuri ending [/spoiler] in my first run.

【Game Time】

It tells players that certain endings require a high enough subject score - this is fine - but then it bars them from reaching that score if they don't do a specific thing two-thirds through the run.

The game works as follows:
- Your daughter has 4 basic attributes, 3 core attributes and 8 subject scores.
- During a turn, she spends action points on activities to earn money and fame, and improve basic attributes and relationships.
- At the end of a turn, she takes up to 5 Courses (reading books or attending lessons) to improve basic attributes, core attributes and subject scores.
- Each ending requires her to reach a specific threshold of attributes and subject scores before graduation (about 36 turns from the time of enrolment).
- More Courses are unlocked through books gifted by NPCs, improving relationships with the 4 teachers, and buying master classes.

Where the game fails is that you can run out of Courses before you run out of turns.

I wanted to get the 'Queen' ending, which requires a score of 500 (C+) in every subject. With about 6 turns to go (June), I realised that I'm 20 points short in Science and there's no more Science course to take. I rolled back to an earlier save (February) but no matter what I did, I still came up 20 points short. I'd already exhausted all the aforementioned ways to unlock more Courses. Reading discussions online, it seems that I should've bought a Science master class. But they're only available to buy 3 times a year and I'd already bought the 'wrong' classes in January.

So I had unwittingly locked myself out of the Queen ending with 12 turns to spare. All because I didn't work out which subjects needed to be supplemented by master classes. Too bad. Return to square one. Bring a spreadsheet next time.

In the end, all it took was one bad design choice to ruin my entire experience with the game. Perhaps you won't encounter the same problem, but don't say you weren't warned.",1690093425,1690200022,False,2,0,0.434962451457977295,0,True,False,False

2. Inconsistent translation. It is Rebessa or Lebsa? Erin or Irene? Lon or Ron? Fix it please, it's annoying.
3. Same (long) epilogue over and over again. (I just want to obtain the ending, stop making me go though it all over again.)
4. Annoying voice acting. Your daughter will still sound like 5 yo even though she already build her own family/become a royal/god's servants. I found it so cringe.

There is so much to manage and there is a lot to do.

I am working on my second ending now, but I will say that I do not exactly see myself going for every single ending since the game does take a while for each ending.

Also, if you want to romance a specific character or get a polyamory ending, I would recommend looking at the wiki for this game on what you need to get a desired character ending or career ending, since they are more then a few requirements you need for a specific ending and the game will not tell you what these requirements are.

The only bad thing I would say is that the game was a bit confusing at first on what I should exactly be doing because there was no tutorial on specific stats or what they mean or how to change them, which was kind of strange since there are a lot of stats and they play an important role in every aspect of the game.",1690075869,1690075903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That doesn't necessarily make this game bad as a simulator as that kinda makes this realistic. However, that's not why I am putting this on a not recommended list as this is a really good daughter raising simulator. I kinda am putting this on a thumbs down list, because there is no middle, eh or idk list. I like daughter raising simulator games, its just that sometimes they go too far in the simulator category that makes you want to go into incognito mode cause you don't want people to know what you are playing.

The problem I have with this game is a bit hard to put bluntly, but I must say that if you are a parent, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE NOTE OF THIS ------> there are child-adult relationships in this game.

Now of course, in a medieval fantasy setting a younger girl marrying an older man would not be uncommon, and both in this game and in an actual medieval kingdom, most people wait until both marriage candidates are adults(unless they are royalty, in which case you could be a 4 year old princess getting married to a middle aged man). putting that out of the way, a lot of romanceable characters in this game are older than the said daughter you are raising from okay 3 to 4 years to questionable 6 to 10(which at the time your daughter goes to an academy makes all these older people legally adults). all the romanceable character close to the same age seemingly are girls.  there is even close to the start of the game a declaration that if anyone defeats a said named enemy, to marry the princess. a woman who is probably 6 to 10 years older than the daughter being raised(yes gay relationships are allowed in this game, you can have a gay daughter if you want).  the only plus side in this is that the game seems to wait a little bit until that daughter becomes an adult, but that's no better than grooming a kid.

it seems like a lot of these daughter raising simulators allow you to have the daughter marry people much older than them. I remember playing some of the older daughter raising simulator games where your daughter can marry an elderly king who is probably 70 years old in that game(much like modern 20 year old hot women try to marry rich 80 year old men, yes this is a thing). Either way, just keep in mind that these type of games can have seriously adult topics that I would not allow anyone at least at and below the age of 12 or anyone with the mental age of a 12 year old to play this game.

That being said, if you understand that child adult relationships are not okay or decide to larp as a bad parent. then go right ahead. its a simulation game at the end of the day these characters are not real I just don't want people to think this kind of thing is normal.




This might be a bit of a spoiler as well so:

The Bad first, there are some strange word choices that makes me wonder if they ran out of money to translate this game into English properly or if the writers simply could not get their story lines straight which led to a somewhat jumbled story telling due to either differences in culture/history/lore between the story tellers and the market audience or some other issues.

Also some parts of the game seem deliberately left rough and undeveloped possibly with an update or DLC sale in the future. (you'll know when you see the huge ass polygons of an otherwise cute anime world).

Its not horrible or totally incomprehensible but your going to have to make some leaps of logic to make the game make sense and prepare for some bad ENRISH SPEEKING from time to time.

Also the game IS simple enough not to need a in-depth tutorial but be prepared to suck at it for a while before you get into the swing of it.

Also if your a fan of Princess Maker (specifically 2 which was my fav game for a time) then its going to feel like a re-release of an old game with a few new graphics and mechanics upgrade.

Now for the good.

It feels like a re-release of Princess Maker 2 with new graphics and mechanics. ^_^

Specially since the new version of Princess Maker 2 had some of its dialogue subtly changed to be more PC from the original and suffers from the same BAD ENRISH from time to time anyway.

Its cute, charming, actually full of characters that aren't irritating caricatures that makes a valiant attempt at being fully fleshed (still somewhat flat given the limits of the game after all), and the story has elements of horror, adventure, drama, romance, high (or low...and poorly rendered) society, school girl life, work and living, gods and goddesses, life/death, the struggles of parenthood and it also subtle and draws you in wonderfully.

Its a game that I somehow stumbled on the True(?) Ending the first time yet I still want to replay this game again to see other branching paths, possibilities and romantic connections that could be had among the characters of the game.

Also despite my near neurotic Tiger Parenting to eek out the best possible stats I could to see Rose rise as high as possible the first time, I didn't quite make it due to inexperience, mistakes  and the cruelty of random numbers so I was surprised by New Game+ mechanic, which coupled with your experience the first time, should allow for a more fun and exploratory second playthrough.

The lure to Aim for the Stars, Again, and Again, until you hit all in the night sky is a great treat.

Be warned though, this game is not just cute tooth rot fodder. There will be times when it gets dark, creepy and made me scream at the screen in rage, fear and frustration.

Specifically when my cute but dumbass kid starts chasing a bird and ignores a cliff.

It...gets better (and worse) from there.

And you'll be glad you stuck through it all.

Edit: I know its not really fitting with the general theme of these types of games but part of me wishes there was a male version now a days. Raising a son instead of a daughter should be feasible enough.

At least it would give a nice contrast and possible unique challenges and mechanic to try.",1689332179,1689533761,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I didn't expected to get so invested in a parenting sim but here I am.  Honestly I think this game would've become a bigger hit with a much better translation. I'm used to questionable translation so I had a fun time. 

PROS:
Nice visuals
Really felt like a parenting sim as Papa Wood and Rose had a fair amount of bonding moments
Lots of side charas and I got invested in most of them. Otome game worthy stuff.
Surprisingly wild backstory.
The huge amount of possible career and romance endings. Has poly endings and lesbian ones too! 
I can feel the love put into this game ngl

OK:
OST
Actual juggling of gameplay.
Combat

CONS:
Translation
Needs more skipping options, especially for the last section. Fast-forwarding option is ok but for the amount of endings the whole SKIP option is almost necessary imo. Please let us skip the heart/bonding moments and the last dinner scene!

If you love “Long Live the Queen” game, or enjoy raising and caring for a child, this game may be for you. It is a visual novel based on a management simulation gameplay. The English translation is tolerable (especially after the early game) and the story is expansive and emotional. There are various characters to romance and interact at several places. And the artwork… so beautiful and so cute at times.

Story:
You follow the story of the father (you) and the daughter. You get the ability to customize the father and daughter’s name, and change the daughter’s outfits. Although viewing the game from the perspective of the father, at a certain point in the early game, the daughter is frequently able to travel alone without the father. Her interactions and adventures outside are within her perspective. Only at home or story events do you return to the father’s perspective.

There is a lot of lore to explore (the war, the spouse, the characters, etc) and you have about 40+ weeks to interact with the story and characters as much as possible. By the end of the game, you will understand what it feels like to be a father of a child. I never thought I would be so proud of a digital daughter.

Characters:
There are 16 romance-able and 2 non-romance-able characters. As you interact, gift, consult, challenge, or hangout with these characters, you will further develop a relationship with them. All of them have 3 unlock-able events with a cute cg artwork. Some are interesting, some cliché, and others are something else. 

Gameplay:
There is quite a bit of mechanics in play that must be covered so here is the simplified general overview.
The game will give you general goals to choose. For example, the kind of father you want to be (doting, strict, mentor, etc) and the progress toward said goals. As you play, the actions or choices you make may advance or hinder your progress to achieving said goal.

From character interactions, weekly class selections, party adventure, and more; there are a lot to do in the game. However, you do not need to go everywhere or do everything. I personally never unlocked the horse racing but still progressed easily. Just do as much or a little as you want to progress through the game.

The game is replay-able, especially if you want to see the 58 potential endings (with amazing cg art) that your daughter will grow up to be, see all three cg events of the interactable characters, or understand the lore behind the war and/or your spouse. It will, however, feel repetitive over time with some gameplay, especially with the weekly class selections.
The one game took about 10 hours for me, probably a few hours shorter if you avoid doing everything or understand the mechanics. 

The English translation, while clearly not the best, is quite do-able. I only really noticed significant translation errors in the early game, with the mid to late game occurring less. The errors themselves are not too difficult to understand the real meaning of the sentence. If grammar is such an issue for you, you may be daunted to play this game but I assured you that its worth the minor trouble to enjoy the game.

Price:
For $14 CDN, its set at a great price. This game became one of my most memorable games (give or take that most games nowadays are expensive for lacklustre gameplay), and with the numerous amounts of endings and replay-ability, it is worth every looney. 

Overall:
If the game pique your interest, purchase it. You always have 2 hours of gameplay before refunding anyway. This game was a renaissance for me as I never had any other similar game that I could compare to “Long Live the Queen.” Thanks to ShocTrooper for recommending the game to me.

Has a lot of NPCs, most of which are romanceable by your daughter. NPCs are generally interesting and open up to you as you raise their favourability. As you play, locations are slowly added for you to explore. There's plenty of career paths for your daughter and events and locations. A few mini-games here and there (they're a bit of a mixed bag I guess).


Now for some negatives. First of all, there is absolutely zero challenge at all! The game is ridiculously easy, like game journalists would find it stupidly easy, that's how easy it is. There's no real stakes, your daughter cannot die, get sick and no real bad ending, etc. Also, even stumbling around on your first playthrough doing random stuff, it's far too easy to level up your stats to unlock the higher end career endings. This is before you start exploiting AP gains to do even more activities. Finishing achievements gives you points to make things even easier for new game+ as well. So if you're looking for a bit of challenge you will likely find yourself really disappointed.

FYI, I unlocked the 'true' ending on my first run, it's stupidly easy to complete. I went for a physical build and near the end of the game I got a prompt to follow my lord in fighting in the forest. So I did so, cleared the final forest level with the lord, then killed the couple of simple boss fights and boom true ending unlocked. Haven't played Princess Maker or some of it's other copycats but the general feel I got from them was that their 'true' endings generally were difficult to complete, requiring lots of exploring in other runs to learn more of secrets, not something everybody can stumble randomly into. I got the general gist of the ending but it was still a bit confusing given that this was my first run through the game. It made more sense after I did a run with the Princess as my lord and I finished this again along with the best career ending.

All the career and romance options make it sound like the game would be good for replayability but the game itself is really linear. Generally you'd want to just grind as many of these out by simply reloading last day save and choosing other career option. There's potions you can get that reduce your stats just for this reason lol. Romance can be swapped by keeping everybody below 140 and then just boosting the person you want with a date + gift.


FYI, game crashed when trying to catch a horse for the first time. This seems to be a known issue and resolved after restarting following the crash. Didn't notice any of bugs of note so overall game was stable for me. The English translation is very rough at times through but still good enough to follow the story.

None of these very minor flaws stopped me from making my first run about 20 hours long though(note: your first run should NOT take anywhere near this long at all), and I regret none of it. This ache in my right shoulder is a skill issue. Great daughter raising simulator - if you like cute girls, consider this game. If you like gay girls, get this game. Hell if you like cute boys, also get this game. There's a lot of CGs and endings to collect, so the replayability is there.

Ok, so there is one tiny issue. The age ranges for most of the love interests are concerning, especially when playing in the 13 year old stage. I know that the idea is she is friends with people for a while before developing feelings but still, being able to pursue someone 20 years older is a bit icky. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but it's something that I had to try my best to ignore in my playthroughs. 

The option to have female love interests and marry them is a great touch! The endings didn't read as romantic in the dialogue as the men's endings, but they were still very cute. And the secret endings are very exciting.

Volcano Princess is a raising sim, a life simulator/stat management game where you play as the single father to a young girl. With her mother missing, it is up to you to care and raise your daughter until she leaves the nest at the age of 18. During a playthrough you will decide which classes she takes, which jobs she works, who will she engage in a relationship with and so on. Depending on your choices your virtual daughter will choose a different career path at the end, and she could become everything from a simple waiter or actress to even a queen of the kingdom itself.

Like in all raising sims, the core gameplay loop of VP is raising your child's stats by interacting with people in a nearby town, enrolling her in classes, and managing her mood/stress level. You only have a limited number of actions you can spend each turn, and you have to think carefully where do you want to put your focus in. You can take part in various festivals, go on banquets, bet on horse races, grow crops on the field, go on expeditions to vanquish monsters in the wilderness, and even gamble through a dice mini-game.

In some ways VP is also kinda a dating sim. The Volcano Kingdom is populated with various people who your daughter can befriend and even romance. And yes, lesbian and even polyamorous relationships are very much possible, if someone wants to guide their daughter that way. It's heartwarming to see diverse love stories unfold, showcasing the developers' commitment to inclusivity and embracing different orientations and relationship dynamics. Each character has their own personality, backstory and preferred topics for conversations, and you can easily keep track of their relationship status with a handy and detailed menu screen. I feel there is something for everybody, from simple tavern girl and childhood friend, to inspired poet, and then a classic womanizer or a timid prince. All this is greatly enhanced by a charming art style. And before somebody asks: no, you can't marry your daughter.

VP has significant replay potential, with over 50 job endings you can earn, not to mention various romance options. For minmaxers, that want their daughter to become a wunderkind that is a world-class actress AND a crime boss AND a legendary warrior AND a prolific writer, there are numerous post-game bonuses. Earning achievements give you points that unlock huge advantages in future playthroughs such as stat boosting, additional dresses (for even more stat boosting) and even improved social status.

Volcano Princess is an ambitious indie title, and it still has a few bugs and exploits, but devs are actively patching them up. The English translation is pretty rough, and it often suffers from awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and occasional inconsistencies, which can detract from the overall experience.

Despite this shortcoming, Volcano Princess remains a captivating daughter-raising simulator that offers hours of engaging gameplay. The game strikes a delicate balance between managing resources, fostering relationships, and exploring a rich world filled with intriguing characters. The narrative is filled with emotional moments, challenging decisions, and unexpected twists that keep players invested in their role as a caretaker.

This game enchanted me. I thought I would refund it, but then I spent 10+ hours utterly absorbed by my virtual daughters life, and then immediately starting a new game once the first had been finished. Whether you're a fan of simulation games or simply appreciate a heartfelt narrative, Volcano Princess is a journey worth embarking on.

Honestly, this is a solid 9.5/10 game for me, I highly recommend it, and I hope we see more games or dlc in the future(It would be amazing if for example, a 1 year anniversary had a ""Ever-After Update"" dlc which showed you a little more of Rose's life after growing up and maybe even let you interact with your love interest, child, or the world. Or maybe even a ""sequel"" dlc that just adds onto the original game and allows you to play further into Rose's life. This is all asking a LOT considering how much obvious love and detail was put into everything thus far so I don't expect this at all, but I'll dream of the future Rose has... My beautiful daughter...

[*]The translation desperately needs work. I'm used to playing games with questionable translations, but in this case the poor translations get in the way of the being able to play the game.

In this way, the game forces you to put Rose's successes at the center of the game. She succeeds at nearly everything she does, because succeeding makes the game easier for you. Rose is designed to make you proud, just to put the panic in your heart when the game asks you: But yo dude, do you even make HER proud?

Rose's day will occasionally be disrupted with problems that you - that is, the father - need to talk her through. What you say to her determines how she sees you. If you neglect her, Rose will still go out and make you proud - but she will see you as terrible. For the most part though, it's hard to do wrong by Rose. Most folks grew up with parents who, even though they fumbled from time to time, loved them dearly. So long as you love your daughter, she will encourage you just as you encouraged her.

In a way, Volcano Princess feels like a celebration of parenthood and the bond that a father has with his daughter. Being a female gamer has its benefits for me here, too. Many of the choices I made reminded me of my own father and how proud he was at every little thing I did. It was a highly nostalgic and therapeutic game for me.

Games it reminds me of:
Love Live the Queen
Chinese Parents
Sunrider Academy
Princess Maker

Here are the minor issues I have with the game:
- Some meaning gets lost in translation. The ""skip bonus"" button after battle should read as ""forfeit items"", as an example.
- The text in duels and debates moves automatically and too quickly. I would have much preferred it if I had to click to advance the text in duels and debates.

I'm a huge fan of the Princess Maker games, so I saw this game and went ""oh God, I am doomed"". And that's exactly what happened. ""How are you putting 33hrs into a daughter-raising management game?"" Honey, I still have one career ending and four more romance endings to get, I am not DONE

The art is SUPER cute, the game makes it easy for you to min-max stats and be able to change it up so you don't have to do like 50 runs (hint: the Strange Man at the docks will later unlock stat-reducing potions so you can get more of the endings that require lower stats!), and oh my god there are so many endings.

What also really helps is that like 95% of the career endings are NOT tied to the romance endings. There's like 3 or 4 career endings that have you not ending up with anyone for Reasons(tm). But I have gotten the most evil ending while still marrying the Princess. Its SO nice to be able to have the romance interests separate from the career endings.

The only slight con I have with this game is that the English translation is not the greatest. You can still understand the story and dialogue, so I was still invested in the True Ending when I got it. But there are moments where you have to stop and go ""...oh THAT'S what they meant"". Its not terrible, but it is noticeable

You will accidentally become a min-maxer and be too addicted to getting every endings but its okay because your daughter is so cute and you wanna do everything to make her happy. Until you start getting the endings associated with Darkness. Then sorry my love, but I need those endings.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to getting more endings. My daughter needs me.",1688495419,1688495419,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

香香的女孩子贴贴最高！
*意外达成百合后宫结局
我是真没料到有百合后宫，但很棒，我喜欢。
二周目我顶多走专情百合路线。
实在不想让我女儿接触男生 弄脏自己的手。

养女儿游戏有13个小时的剧情 算不错了。
没有限制女儿的故事 让其自由发展是正确的。女儿当不当勇者 都是爸爸的宝贝。
虽然没什么特效， 配音也没有配完全不对话。

有一点二周目的念头。毕竟我想看看真正的勇者路线。也想看看把乖女儿养成大魔王会怎样。",1688228357,1688228357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]

1. Grammar. (In English at least)
The grammar could use some work which is understandable since the game is originally Chinese. The names of the characters are inconsistent and changes from time to time in the story and even in the achievements which leads to confusion. Most of these are negligible and very minor but you'll have to connect the dots yourself sometimes.


[hr][/hr]
[h1]Possible spoilers below[/h1]
[hr][/hr]


2. Endings/Achievements*
My biggest gripe of the game as of writing this review. The way this game checks for some endings (and some achievements) is via tiers which means that you'll some endings have that have 2 or more versions of that ending and whichever the highest tier depending of its conditions is the ONLY ending you can select. Heres a very simplified example of what.

[table]
[tr][th]Ending[/th][th]Requirement[/th][/tr]
[tr][td]Scholar[/td][td]MND > 50[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Great Scholar[/td][td]MND > 100[/td][/tr]
[/table]

Here you can see 2 endings split in 2 different tier and this is where the problem starts. If by the end of the game lets say your MND is around 120, that would mean that you will unlock the Great Scholar ending and [b]ONLY[/b] the Great Scholar ending so even if you technically cleared the requirements for the lower tier ending, it will not be unlocked unless you play the game again from the start and [b]PURPOSELY[/b] limit your characters abilities. Leading to multiple ""speedrun""s of the game just to unlock an ending.

As much as I like the game, I dont have it in me to play extra fast multiple times just to unlock endings and I hope we get to have a patch in the future to just unlock all tiers of endings as a choice if we did meet its criteria. Overall though, my enjoyment if the game is still good and I highly recommend it.",1688199061,1688199384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As soon as these are fixed I can confidently give it my seal of approval. I would still recommend it if you can snag it on a good steam-sale deal

1.
Currently the English translation is riddled grammatical mistakes and other problems such as;
-Spelling errors 
-Capitalization problems
-Incorrect Syntaxing
-Weird/stiff sounding English or ""Chinese word for word translations"" occasionally
              -This causes some NPC dialogue, which I assume in Chinese would characterize the NPC's better, to feel very samey
-The tutorial text and ""system mechanic"" names are written in really bizarre English.

2. 
There are a surprisingly large amount of bugs for what is a glorified visual novel. Some of these will freeze your game forcing you to close the application and start the day over and some causes text dialogue to skip at seemingly random

Beyond these 2 massive problems that keep me from recommending this game I do have a fair bit of other criticisms just the same way I have things that I would praise the game for.

[u]Cons:[/u] 
0. All of the bugs/English translation problems that I noted above.
1. The gameplay gets very stale very quickly because of it's repetitive nature. The game tries to remedy this by giving the players minigames and access to an turn-based RPG combat area but it does not in anyway push you towards that with a very few exceptions.
2. The soundtrack is fairly poor and the Audio mixing is none existent. At best it's a atmospheric piece that gets abruptly cut off because you left the area. At worst it's a very recognizable copyright free ost that clearly stands out and does not fit the vibe of the area at all.
3. You will need to discover most of the game by yourself. It gives occasional tutorials but they're written in bizarre English and are mostly front-loaded when you start playing the game. It can be a struggle to find the tutorials after you've clicked past them.
You could argue that the last point is kind of fitting as it's a game about growing up and having to find your own way in this world

[u]Pros:[/u] 
1. A very wholesome and comfy story about growing up. At times the characters can seem a bit unrealistic for their age in terms of how they act but that's a minor nitpick on my end.
2. Overall very good looking artwork.
3. A lot of endings with a build in newgame+ to speed things up..
4. The game does not lock your daughter into just dating ""canonical characters"" as many games use as an excuse. If they're an NPC that you can build rapport with, they're romanceable.

Essentially you play as a father raising his daughter and helping her to grow into a young lady. There are many different characters you can befriend or marry, this game allows you to marry both men and women and if you want you can have a romantic ending with 2 people at the same time! 

Like any other game you have skills you should raise to get the outcome you want, depending on what skill you focus on you get a different career endings, and some romantic endings. Unlike other games you choose the ending, meaning it gives you multiple options in the end if you focused on multiple skills or if that skill has multiple careers tied to it. It also tells you what skills you have to upgrade to get closer to the NPCs instead of just leaving you to figure it out yourself.

The only cons to this game is the bad grammar and/or chopping sentences. This game is very Dialog heavy and has a story you can follow, while it was slightly difficult to understand what they were saying initially I managed to understand if I thought about it for a second. So maybe don't play of you're just going to skip all the dialog as it makes up most the game-play. 

What I really liked about this game is that its easy to befriend the NPCs, say you talked to them once every month, if you do that literally every month in the end you will have befriended them, of course it would take some more effort to romance them but you would be more than halfway there at that point.

This game is full of secrets, joy and well impact, every single decision counts which isn't surprising at all given what this game is about. Although I played this game from from start to finish in one sitting, I didn't regret any bit of it, except the headache which is coming on now, but reviews are best written while the game is still fresh in your memory. Still there are a few things that will unfortunately drag the score down,  let me  explain in a bit.

Story: 10/10 
Art/Graphics: 10/10 
Gameplay: 6.5/10 
Soundtrack: 6.5/10 
Translation for ENG: 5/10 
Replayability: Yup
Overall score: 7/10

Reasons for the scores:

* Story: Multiple choices and multiple endings
* Art/Graphics: Very cute, its anime no surprise there
* Gameplay: Due to translation issues/bugs, my score would randomly drop when it shouldn't have and vice versa, accordingly if you did well by the scores, the dialogue would say you did poorly and the other way around. Hardly any tutorials - you'd get randomly thrown in many of the events and by the time you figure out what to do you've lost action points and gold
Soundtrack: Ambient audio doesn't fit with the setting e.g. sirens can be heard in the background and its very repetitive
* English translation: C for effort, but there are a lot of words with grammar issues, random spaces, some sentences are all lowercase. You eventually get used to it, but it harms immersion. I could fix the issues for free, don't have much to do anyways
* Bugs: Quite a few, but might just be me, I'll do a NG+ run and re-check. Autosave and manual save do the same thing, which is putting you back at the start of the month, not where you left off

This follows a similar format of the princess maker series of raising a young lady with multiple endings and routes to go on, which means there's a ton of hours to invest into this game! Anyone who is interested in having a relaxing time trying out all the different routes, leveling up your daughter in different skills, each route opens up a lot of new dialogue and things you wouldn't see every single time you replay it! 

Only cons I have that may be patched  ; This game is translated and so the dialogue rarely and briefly seems a little off - but not a major deal breaker for me! Just something to note!

This also may seem like a lot of information is thrown at you at the beginning of the game but it's super easy to follow and understand as you continue to play!

 I would recommend just taking your time to figure things out, if you don't do amazing during your first route, the game doesn't punish you, plus this is a game MEANT for replaying over and over for different endings! Have fun!

I was not sure whether I should buy this game considering people were talking about translation errors and some bugs, as well as there being a lot to micromanage, but honestly the management is super easy and explained well and the rest don't ruin the experience enough to make me say ""don't buy it"". I only encountered maybe 2 bugs/crashes through my entire game, and most of the time if there is a less than amazing translation you can usually figure out what it means.

My first play through took about 12 or so hours and I was smiling like a damn idiot the whole way through. I also did a lot of useless and random stuff which might've made my play time longer and while there is a wiki that is pretty bare-bones as I am writing this most things are easy enough to understand and even an idiot like me got the true ending on my first run. Another great part about this game is that unlike the usually empty void in my heart I feel when I complete a game, I actually felt incredibly happy to see my daughter become a functioning person. It made me feel so damn proud, so much so that I wrote this review.

This game is great, and now having the bonuses unlocked it makes me even more inclined to play again, though I'll be damned if you get me to do any of the vile endings, they may be achievements but you will not tempt me.

This is a fantastic entry as far as a Raising Sim is concerned. 

It does pretty much everything right. Gorgeous Art, varied dialogue and options, interesting characters with backgrounds to discover and many, many endings to shoot for. 

It also serves as a great introduction to the genre by slowly enabling options through the first playthrough, and through subsequent playthroughs these mechanics can be skipped past extremely quickly. 

The game incentivizes repeat playthroughs through it's copious amounts of achievements serving an actual purpose. Achieve something, and you get points to spend towards your next attempt. Giving you that incentive to try something new and experiment with the options available to you. 

Unlike other games in this genre, the Father figure is not a completely devoid character detached from the experience. You have goals made for yourself as well. Which takes some effort to figure out how your choices relate to the overall goal. 

There is a story to this with some wonderful foreshadowing in various ways for those willing to pay attention. 

Edit: The game does have an appropriate ending, it just took a fourth play-through to get to. That addresses the questions I had as far as the plot was concerned. So I figured I'd edit my review to account for that. 

If I would want to nitpick things:

There are some grammatical and spelling mistakes in the English version, which are being worked on. Some characters are called by the wrong name, feature name changes depending on menu, and other shenanigans happening, leading to some confusion on who they are. Some character names in particular make little sense in English. Rebsa/Lebsa, one of the Knight Lords being one such example. 

I would like to see what choices related to choosing Blood Type and what it actually impacts, since that's not something native to my Country. So I have no idea what my choices mean, if anything at all. With how useless Google Search has become: finding useful and relevant information is such a huge pain, it's almost not worth it. Even for recreational stuff. I just want to be able to make a more informed choice here. 

So whether you are a fan of this genre of game, or someone whose interested in giving this type of game a shot. I can highly recommend Volcano Princess for being a great way to get introduced to this style of game and a fantastic take for those familiar with the style. 

With how Achievements feature as a means to improve your starting stats and abilities: it's a fantastic way to get some replay value. As each subsequent playthrough can unlock more potential endings and making the initial setup shorter and shorter each time.

After several playthroughs, oh boy this is a gem.
It is like the Princess Maker 2 or 3, but even better.
More QoL, better progression, like it has shorter little-kid period to access to the latter options faster. The art is cute, the chibi are cute.
If anything lack is probably the lewd aspect of the Princess Maker (they had more revealing outfit). But i'm not complaining, outfits in this game are top notch design wise.
My complaint is, i feel this could be expanded further...
Perhaps at later DLC.
The child's job for example, is a bit lacking compared to PM.
No church job, work at home options (housekeeping, stable keeping for example).
Also more dungeon variety, other than the forest and the dark alley.
More costume, i liked the gears at the ending.
Full plate armor, Hunter outfit, etc.
Or even go to r18 if you want to be thorough with some of the endings.

For who don't understand Princess Maker.
It is a kid raising game. From a little 8-10 y/o kid to 17 or 18th.
Doing actions will increase or decrease the kid's stat. The actions are such, taking a lesson, doing work, battling monsters, fishing, farming, painting, participating contests, festival, etc. How you manage your daughter will trigger a specific ending. You might be a doting father, caring father, etc. Also it will decide with whom she will marry later. It is quite an arduous process, especially at the original Princess Maker. And the ending is supposedly the fruition of your hard work. It is a management game with RPG element, have multiple story, and ending. Collecting the harder ending is also why it has a lot of replay-ability value.

Do i recommend the game? Oh yes. A big yes.
This game has a lot of content for the price.
A huge replay-ability to complete its multiple ending. And each playtrough may weave a different story.
My previous complaint was because the ending outfits are such a masterpiece, and more content is a big welcome.

The characters are very likable, the courses to study all make sense and give worthwhile benefits, and the mysteries are intriguing and the choices are truly varied.

My only real complaint is that it feels like the time goes too fast. We keep checking back in every month even though we only choose courses for a week. I understand much of this is for balancing, but with how the system is set up, any courses you can't complete in four classes aren't worth pursuing at all and any books that can be accomplished in a day trumps the regular curriculum. I can understand wanting to make sure the player doesn't do too much, but there's enough course options I think the chance to have more time there, like choosing the courses week by week then only getting the days with the daughter every month as it is currently, would improve the experience, allowing more of a chance to round out the daughter or to utterly focus on all the courses in their main area of expertise.",1687051695,1687051695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bear in mind you can get multiple per playthrough, the game encourages reloading the last save to see the different endings you met the criteria for so it's not like you need to do the full 8-9 hours to beat it for every ending.

Gameplay's a lot of fun, has lot of mini games (a turned based rpg, horse racing, a dice game, dating sim to name a few) but they all work fine and it's all well structured around building stats and making smart choices. Best compliment I can give is the sheer effort on display - so many little bits and pieces that really show the devs poured their hearts into the project.

If I had a main criticism though, it's the English translation. I appreciate that the devs are based in Beijing and it doesn't seem like China has the best access to translators but it is really noticeably stiff at times, to the point I wonder if they just used an AI or something to run over the script. That being said though it is perfectly readable, just some awkward lines. The other text translations are Simplified Chinese and I think Japanese (sorry I'm quite bad at discerning other languages, steam only lists Chinese and English so might be wrong) and from what I understand those are way better.

The art for the game is everywhere, and gorgeous. No matter what you're doing, they have specific art for it. Cooking? small animation, each class subject has it's own art too. Without spoiling too much, every one of the numerous endings has their own CG and dialogue to truly show how she's faring.

The game play is nice and simple, you as a dad manage what classes your daughter takes, and what she does until she grows old enough and ascertains her own autonomy. When she gets there, you control her instead but the dialogue and stuff still talks about you being the dad and all. These activities give you stats which will be instrumental in helping get any ending

When it comes to getting those aforementioned endings, volcano princess makes the trips to these endings much easier and you'll need it since you aren't accomplishing s**t on your first playthrough. It's not an insult, its a fact but eventually you'll get the good endings. 

No game is without flaw, thankfully there aren't too many. The translation is still bad, but no where near as bad as before this last update. Now you can understand what every character is getting at when they're speaking rather than disjointed thoughts you have to scrape together.

Now that i know what every character is actually saying, without spoiling anything once again, they're all mostly unique. I can't say i found any of them outright annoying, and each of the associated events are quite sweet, with even the edgier characters having nice wholesome moments (mostly).

Being able to skip dialogue with CTRL is a godsend after your first couple loops. If you want to see most of this game, one go around will be no-where near enough giving the game immense replayability.

Now I know i'm a stranger, but i'm handing out unsolicited advice and you can't stop yourself from reading this review now anyway.
If you do decide to play this game, Go in as blind as possible. Don't worry too much about any of the stats, what ending you may get, or whatever. The wiki can and should wait. Just focus on being a parent first. Cherish that time as a parent watching her grow up and remain blissfully ignorant of the inevitable numbers game to get the cool endings.

It's pretty similar to the original princesses maker games with needed to upgrade your child's states until she turns the age of 18, but it is far more easier to play then what you can get from princess maker 2 that came out in 1993. Since in Volcano Princess it's basically impossible for your child to fail in life due to your child having FAR less needs or even wants, she dose what you tell her to do no matter what. The only way you could fail is if you SEEK out frailer which in my option makes the game a bit bland, I feel like the game would benefit if it was some how harder to keep her darkness level down and added more random events effected by her darkness level. So it can keep players on their toes while playing the game.

I have more to say but this is more of what I WANT and WISH was in the game more then what SHOULD be in the game.
---
I due hope that in future updates the game will add more interactions with the characters, more ""bad"" ending depending on what you consider bad, more random events with all the characters based on states and relationship level, more job options, and more dialogue from your child when she speaks to you 
---
The game is really well made and I'm willing to play 100% of it though, but I do believe their can be MORE added to it. To make me enjoy myself and others times while playing it because I must admit after my 3ed play though it was already a bit of a drag since I already knew the main story already...and was just skipping through the story and interactions with the characters that I had already experienced their events since they don't say anything new or interesting. This is especially a drag when your child shows censers in the game thing over and over again...with each play though....

It's one of the best of the genre I've played so far! I wouldn't say that it does anything particularly special, but it just does everything right. Sometimes getting all the basics of the game smooth and polished all you need to make a fantastic game.
The game loop is a fair length, about 7 hours per run (and longer for your first go of course), but it's somehow not tedious. I've only played it through about 6 times and I haven't even discovered everything that the game has to offer yet. I personally don't really like the minigames, but it doesn't take away from the main mechanics of the game. The stat system sits somewhere between unforgivably challenging and easy, which is part of why it didn't feel tedious.
There are quite a few characters, and they are lovely to talk with. Even with the idle chatter, they don't repeat dialogue, which is honestly incredible. Amazing job by the game's writers! Each character is also really unique, well developed, and ties beautifully within Volcano. It's selfish of me but I do wish there were more special romance scenes per character, because there are only three per character, and I want to know more about them! I was surprised on two counts, firstly that you could 'romance' pretty much every character, and secondly that there were even polyamory options. I haven't tried the poly options yet, but man it's nice to see they're there!
Art was flawless, your daughter always looks adorable no matter which outfit you pick! There are so many beautifully drawn little scenes in the game too, it really was a feast for the eyes.
A definitely must play if you're a fan of the genre, it's just done too well to miss out on it!

But, unlike normal Chinese parenting which is about trapping your child in a pain box and forcing the to learn the piano by the age of four, this is more of a visual novel where you raise your virtual daughter in arguably the most easy simulation game I have ever seen.

So, let's start with the good and the bad.

The Good:
1. It's super cute. Like insanely cute. The NPCs are all charming enough and the writing makes you want to say ""awwhhhh"" while force feeding your dog taco bell. I mean, it's so absurdly adorable that it almost makes me feel sick in some kinda strange gut feel.

2. There is like a million different endings and all of them are pretty entertaining.

3. It has enough variety in day to day activities to not get boring.

The Bad:
1. It's far too easy. Like, absurdly easy. You will power max each stat with ease on your first play. It'a almost impressive how much hand holding the game has with action point recovery which is the resource used for the limited actions you have in each day in game.

2. The Combat system is really dumb. I mean, once again, it's easy, but it's very boring. 

3. Translation. There is various little translation errors and while I don't blame Chinese dev's for having these issues, there is a few times in game where you will just be baffled by the translation job and it's meager attempts to keep everything inline. 

4. The devs I believe have been trying to figure out the steam cloud save options for like six months now and are still trying to battle it, which, while funny, seems kind of odd. 

So, is Volcano Princess good? Yeah, it's a fun game. I got my money and feels out of it. But it def could use a bit of spice and perhaps far more difficulty.

Что характерно, весь активный игровой процесс проходит именно за ребенка в то время как отце оказывает пассивную помощь с поднятие статов и в целом ""руководит"" учебным процессом. 
Проект очень милый и уютный с явной расчетом на второе прохождение. (Тут просто тонна достижений)

Однако на данный момент, у игры есть серьезная проблема. А именно локализация. 
Как я понимаю на момент Мая 2023го Русской локализации тут нет, а та английская что есть весьма корявая. Тут и ошибки и лишние слова в предложениях, ненужные пропуски, не замененные шрифты и в целом сам текст написан словно через переводчик. Это ОЧЕНЬ большая проблема так как ломает весь интерес читать что говорят персонажи.

You can carry over your efforts between playthroughs, making it easier to try for specific endings. 
You can also CHOOSE (not outright, but as a range) which type of ending you're aiming for.
Romance and Job/Adventure/Story endings are separate- you're not locking yourself out of a specific job ending if you want to marry the prince, for instance. You can have both! 

Cons:
lots of clicking/hitting space. I do wish there was controller support, because I got carpal tunnel issues and games with lots of clicking/repetitive motions hurt my arms.

It does have very nice artwork, a slick presentation, a narrative story (!) and already a lot of replay value possible. 

However, [b]I can only give the game a lukewarm recommendation[/b] for one glaring reason: [b]the English translations and localisations are fairly poor.[/b]

I've played Chinese Parents which is in the same genre, and it also suffers from poor translation and localisation, but I think it feels worse in Volcano Princess for one glaring reason: [b] the English translation/localisation is the only thing holding this game back from being absolutely outstanding[/b]!

There is so much content under the hood here for this niche genre, and most impressively, the game does a nice job in the early days of giving you a tutorial of the nature of stat management and how to invest your time as you go.  Some games in this genre offer little to no guidance, so Volcano Princess does that remarkably well. Also, there is a legitimate plot and story arc going on here that is meatier than the generalities of lore you might see in Princess Maker 2.  I really love that. 

The content, visuals, and gameplay loop are all here, frankly. But with the amount of content and character dialogue there is for building relationships, and other scenes that revolve around it, language is a lot more important to the enjoyment of the game.  And with the jarring translation and localisation choices peppered throughout in dialogue, menus, and tips, it really lets the game down and affects my enjoyment of it.

I understand the game has likely been made by a small team, and may not have had much in the way of resource to dedicate to English translation and localisation.  But God, if they could improve it, I'd recommend the game to all of my friends who enjoy VNs and simulation games.

The game focused more on grinding and very much strategy-based, and the strategy part also differs in terms of what goal/ending you are working to get by the end of it.

Some of the issues that is a bit off-putting for me is just the translation in terms of the characters' name and the dialogues. As someone who doesn't speak English as their first language, it is understandable, however I do hope this will be improved in the future. However, some of the inconsistent spacing between words in the English version is jarring which often happens when you translate the writings into this language, but I'm sure this will be fixed in future updates. The energy bar is small and a bit limited since certain actions can cost you around 5-8 points, which means it is depleted quite fast unless you've prepared beforehand, but that adds to the challenging nature of this game which can be a selling point to other players. Some of the mini-games' instructions are a little unclear which are partly due to the translation issue, and partly due to myself for not connecting the dots. There are some bugs that you might accidentally find, but from my experience after encountering one and submitting a report, the developers are proactive in solving them although it might take some time.

As this is my first time playing a game within this genre, I'm not able to provide an in-depth comment on the plot except that I did enjoy the story line. The art style is cute. I love that you have a lot of options when it comes to love interests and even other relationships, who each have an interesting story to tell. I like that I can restart the day if I messed up on certain activities, which is very forgiving of the game. As another person commented, despite being the father, it does feel like the story doesn't push the daughter to the side and give her the autonomy in most of the actions performed in the game as the story revolves around her life. The playthroughs that come after you've completed the first one feel easier once you familiarized yourself with it.

Overall, would I recommend it? Yes, if you can overlook the problems I mentioned and allow the developers some time to solve it. I'd say it is a nice introductory game for beginners!",1684332697,1684332697,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There are tons of systems which on their own have just enough depth to make them interesting, but the breadth of things to occupy your (daughter's) days with is really fun. Each little activity has a small learning curve before you can figure out how to maximize your success: admittedly none of the activities seem very well balanced or super polished, so once you figure out the optimal strategy there is not much to think about within the activity itself. You really have tons of freedom though with which parts of the game to engage with and come up with a palette of activities you want to focus on. The main choice is always where you want to spend your time, and it really just feels like a bonus that each system is deep enough to be somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it seems like there were some systems which got cut, and some items which don't really have a use... a shame that it could have been even better.

The other 5% is mostly just small errors like characters having different romanized names (e.g. rebessa instead of lebsa) and only a few times I wasn't fully sure what was being said.

Volcano Princess is a Princess Maker-style game from a Chinese indie studio. Both of these facts will be obvious from within a few seconds of starting the game. It's proudly inspired by PM and borrows mechanics and ideas liberally, but generally does so with updates and reimaginings that make it much more than a shallow copy. Alas, being obviously from a Chinese studio is down to the English text being absolutely riddled with errors typical of translation from Chinese. It's by no means the worst example I've ever seen, and you're not going to get anything as bad as older translation gems like Zero Wing, but you do need to be prepared for a lot of strange turns of phrase and a smaller amount of unclear or incorrect descriptions. If you played Chinese Parents around when it first launched in English, the translation quality is similar.

Still, assuming you can get past that, nearly everything else about the game is very well done. Like the good Princess Maker titles, it reduces raising a kid to scheduling a whole bunch of classes and jobs over their childhood, then gives you some scenes at the end about how you've either raised an absolute monster or the hero of the world. Also like some PM games, there are multiple combat systems for the daughter to go and kill monsters with, as well as a couple of other minigames like horse racing or playing dice. None of it is very deep or necessarily balanced, but there's so much of it that you can easily go through a few playthroughs without repeating very much of the side content. 

Speaking of multiple playthroughs, VP very much expects you to play it more than once. You're not practically guaranteed to be a failure on your first run like in Chinese Parents, but the best endings seem clearly out of reach until you've upgraded your starting character a few times. Each finished run gives you some points depending on what you did, and those points provide you with better starting stats or items so you can get to those better endings. As a bonus, this also lets you quickly blow past the early game content that you've already seen. 

I've also seen this compared to Long Live the Queen a few times, but I think you'll be disappointed if that game is primarily what you're after. LLtQ is mostly about trying to navigate a world full of absurd deathtraps trying to stop your game early. I don't think it's possible to die at all in VP, and the focus is much more on the daughter's relationships with the player character and NPCs than on running any kingdoms. Similarly, if you want something like Cute Knight, know that the combat and dungeons here are much more basic. 

I generally prefer these games when they're like Cute Knight or Growing Up and cast you as the main character instead of a parent since it's a bit less creepy, but I will say that Volcano Princess is much better in that regard than Princess Maker. VP goes out of its way to show that the daughter has agency and her own concerns, and what she thinks of you is it's own objective and part of the ending. It hasn't changed my opinion that I'd rather play as the kid directly, but VP is probably the best alternative I've seen so far.

I've been playing this game almost non stop since release. I bought it for myself for my birthday as I love daughter/princess raising sims. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much content is in this game for the price!! The art style, all the endings and achievements possible, the backstories and all the mini-games make this an absolute steal.

In the beginning there were a few bugs that were frustrating however I expected such as a brand new game and the developers have been releasing updates in a very timely manner. Some of the translations are a little off as you can tell it wasn't English based but nothing I can't understand or look over.

I'll be sad when I've completed all the achievements and have no reason to play anymore.. looking forward to future games like this if they come out with any more!!",1683899458,1683899458,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let us get this right out of the way at the start: Volcano Princess is a brilliant game and everyone who has even a small interest in the game after watching the trailer or reading the synopsis should definitely buy it. The price is completely fair for the amount of content you get.

Now to put into words why this game is so good.

[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]
This game is drop dead gorgeous for its niche. The artstyle is reminiscent of Chinese web comics first and foremost and really good ones at that. There are an unusual amount of CGs in this game. From ending professions and romance options, to story scenes or even minor interactions, the art is everywhere. A lot of raising sims mostly rely on text or numbers, but Volcano Princess goes the extra mile to visualize almost everything. 
Even the inventory items and monster designs are all lovingly made with details that immerse you even more. Every location is very distinct and even one off events like tournaments get special screens.

The only area where the game is slightly hindered is when it comes to animations. They are generally a bit clunky or unexpressive, but that too has its charme. These usually only happen during activities and are more like small gifs. Generally the art is static.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
The basic gameplay loop is simple. You are tasked with raising your daughter by advising her and deciding what she will study at the academy. Unlike a lot of raisintg sims however, you spent a considerable amount of time every day from the daughter's point of view and make those decisions through her. So it is not that the father molds his daughter like a puppet, but rather that the player takes both the role of the father and the daughter.

As expected from this genre, most of your focus will be on raising stats or gaining favor with people. Gathering items, receiving gits and better lectures are all means to getting one of the over 50 professions the game has to offer, alongside figuring out your potential marriage partner(s). The game offers an unprecedented amount of choices and variables for this and if you don't want to work at all or if you dislike romance you can even avoid both of those things altogether.

What stands out most is just the sheer variety of activities the game offers. I spent my entire first playthrough completely ignoring the horse catching/raising game and never participated in races. But those are fully fleshed out mechanics that you can focus an entire playthrough around to get fame and money. You can go explore dungeons with friends, you can go to banquets and get acqauinted with nobles, you can study all day, you can go fishing, you can do alchemy, duel other characters in battle or debates, work as an actress or in a bathouse... and so so so much more.

Your academic/knight tasks depend mostly on what house you picked when you enrolled and who your Lord/Lady is. You can pick one of three and the head of each faction is only available for interaction when you pick theirs, so certain romance options or quests are only available depending on the current faction.

The daily loop I think most will go through is this: Father/daughter interactions --> farming at the field to get items --> raising your stats and interacting with characters and activities --> decide on that month's curriculum at the academy.
The game has around 40 turns (which each represent one month) and once your daughter is 18 years old and becomes and adult the game ends.

[b][u]Romance[/u][/b]
The game features a large and lovable cast of characters. Not all of them are love interests, but the majority are. Your daughter (whose default name is Rose, so I will call her that usually) is bisexual and can marry both men and women. The choices are exceptionally varied. You can let Rose romance her classmates, her Lords/Ladies, royalty, the inn keeper, a nun, artists, a lone wolf mercenary and many more.
The method to get those romance endings is basically to hang out with the characters you like and get their affection to the right level and see their events. Some endings or paths will lead to not having certain options available, but do not be discouraged, that love can bloom in another playthrough.

This game really has a endearing cast in general, but I think some of my favorite characters are princess Gwyneth, her brother Kenneth (you can get a polyamorous ending with both of them as your lovers btw), the best friend Nina and the author Lon.
Whether you prefer straight romance, lesbian romance or something inbetween, the game has it all and is not judgemental in any way. Two women can marry without issue and are just as valid as any other option. The age gap between Rose and some of these characters is rather large admittedly, but that's the great thing, you don't have to do anything you dislike.

I generally prefer yuri/sapphic romance, so I was quite pleased with the plentiful of female love interests, but the game presents all its characters so charmingly that I didn't mind getting Rose close to the boys as well. Due to the nature of the game encouraging replays it is fine to experiment more in my opinion.

My only gripe right now is that one romance partner is very questionable... for story related reasons. And yes there is a story!

[b][u]Story[/u][/b]
While the overall goal is simply for the daughter to grow into a great adult, there is a lot more going on with the Volcano Kingdom. It has a lot of well integrated lore that you uncover slowly as time goes on. The game has a delightful amount of sublety as well. Many character relations and connections are not spelled out to the player, but can be discovered instead. 

The game sports a ""True Ending"", which is not mutually exclusive from any other ending choice though! You can still get any job or any love interest (barring one) if you get the True Ending. It reveals a lot of plot points that were only hinted at across the game and can be quite challenging to achieve. I doubt many players will get it on their first playthrough. Right now a few things about the plot are still rather vague or confusing to me, but I have also not done everything the game has to offer yet!

[b][u]Other points[/u][/b]
The English translation can be a bit lacking in certain parts of the game. The overall translation effort is good and most of it is understandable. The quality differences between certain events or descriptions are very noticable however. The devs are updating the game a lot and have already improved a lot of things, including the translation, so my hope is that eventually the quality will be on the same level everywhere.

You can pick between Chinese or Japanese voice options, but the only character who is really voiced is the daughter. I personally prefered the Japanese performance, but this is very subjective. Either way the voice work is very good. And it's not like all her lines are voiced, it is only specific scenes. Otherwise every character has distinctive noises they make.

The game's save system is a bit limited. You can only save at the start of a month/the turn, meaning that if you reload the game you start from the beginning of the day. This means if you wish to quickly redo a choice or activity you will have to go through the entire day again. This probably is meant to disincentivize save scumming and make you stick with decisions, but it is not very fun for me personally.

The game has exploits, but if you are looking for them then that's probably your prefered playstyle. They may be patched out later or maybe they won't.

The music is really good actually. From calm background music to themes that stick in your head, the game's composition feels almost classical and very inspired. The sound effects are on a similar caliber. Just hovering over icons gives completely different sound responses and level up noises and the like are all soooo satisfying.

Volcano Princess was the second.  I bought this game with absolutely no expectations, simply off the 'game style' which seemed rather generic on the surface, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The reason it is so highly rated was quickly apparently.  The depths of the game has had me playing it religiously for the past three days.  I beat it once, then immediately started a second play-through and beat it again within those three days.

If I could complain about anything (and lets face it, I always can), it's either the translation or lack of certain things being finished.  I don't want to give spoilers but some things are so vague it's apparent that there is some sort of language mishap going on, or it's a feature not fully implemented.  29 hours played, been through it twice, nowhere near done everything in the game (though I can see how after a couple times through certain aspects could become repetitive).

Unlike most of these style games, the choices really do matter.  A lot.  But they matter so much that they don't matter for completing the game.  There's so many endings and choices, and you don't have to be a big hero.  First time I just ended up as a great music composer.    I haven't even touched alchemy, horse riding, stealing, or several other aspects of the game because there's so much to do that I don't think you can manage to do everything to any degree of proficiency in just one go.

My first run through I was surprised how easily and massively I failed at everything, by late game I was starting to develop stats/skills and enjoyed it more but the second playthrough was definitely the more fun one. I'm on my third playthrough now and there are a load of endings you can shoot for but you can definitely max out the second playthrough if you want. 

The game had a lot of broken text early-on and I can't tell if it has been mostly patched out or if I just don't notice it as much but it isn't a big deal. 

While there's not any really satisfying romance options, if you like visual novels I imagine that this will be up your alley. I personally just love stat maxing and roguelites so I found a lot of enjoyment. It feels a bit like Persona 5 with far less combat and less relatable characters. 

A fairly large flaw in the game is that it clearly wasn't finished, several items have no purpose other than sale and according to the community page there was a more in-depth magic/alchemy system in the works. So unfortunately all those cool artifacts and magic ingredients you get are just pointless entirely. I am hopeful they will patch this in future. 

Overall I recommend this game and continue to get my money's worth out of it. It's really satisfying to smash through all the early challenges that were previously insurmountable and I'm getting enough enjoyment out of focusing on different goals.

Its a streamlined and lovely successor to the Princess Maker style child raising game legacy. The art is beautiful, I LOVE that there are both male and female love interests for the daughter that are equally and explicitly romantic. Raising stats and getting endings is straightforward with only some finesse needed to get the highest stat endings (the requirements are in the collection gallery for all endings). I like the story and think that it is a very fresh and unique take on the [spoiler] child of/from god in the [/spoiler] Princess Maker series. Yes, there are some translation issues but the games for the majority reads and can easily be understood in English so I would say translation issues are minor in the story imo -- and the devs are very actively working on fixing and improving these issues-- I would say the biggest issue translation wise is in the achievement names/ some of the achievements names are mistakenly switched. I really love this game and recommend it if you have enjoyed Princess Maker/ Raising Sim games in the past!

Pros: 
- beautiful art
- fresh paint on a beloved classic
- male and female romance options [spoiler] and group [/spoiler]
- easy text skipping
- achieving endings is straightforward and the stats and requirements are easily found
- enjoyable music
- active game devs working on improving the game and fixing bugs every week (as of writing this review)

Cons
- some (overall minor) translation issues in the main story/text of the game
- some annoying bugs cropping up here and there (devs have been good about fixing these quickly)

-The story
-The visuals
-The adorable
-The price
and many more.
First of all this review is written with only one ending finished out of like sixty.

-THE STORY:
+It is engaging.
+It is absolutely adorable, especially early on.
+Has an amazing twist (IMHO)
+It is extremely customizable with the exception of a few scripted events.
+Every character has a personality that actually adds to a character.
-/+ It is quite long. (I took my time on my first play and it took 12 hours)
-Some dialogue will get boring after a few runs, especially if you want to 100% achievement grind it.

-THE ADORABLE:
+Every ending has a different end card.
+Your daughter is absolutely adorable.
+Sometimes it will go to an old tale kind of art stile for memories.

-THE PRICE:
+It is a robbery, as in you rob the developer. There is so much content in this game and so much love that I recommend it to anyone who is into slice of life or visual novels.

-ESTIMATED PLAY TIME
+There are 58 different endings, I'd say it takes about 8 hours/ending after you the first run, bringing the 100% play time if everything is done perfectly to 9 days and 12 hours of constant playing without break or sleep.
+Certain endings or collectibles are harder to obtain, so it might take you more to 100% than 9 and a half days.

-This game is an achievement collectors wet dream or lucid nightmare.

-The music:
-It is nothing special, some of it I think, is free use music but it does not hurt the game that much.

-If you start Playing this game you might just play for a 12 hours straight just to see the ending.",1683411335,1683411335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is very much like Princess Maker so it was a no-brainer that I would get it. I can say confidently that I enjoyed this game thoroughly. It was addicting and highly replayable and had bonuses in case you finished a playthrough that can make your next new game easier which was a nice touch for those who want to complete the game 'easier'.

The story/plot was also very interesting, I won't spoil it here though, also the setting was also nice. It had a nice amount of gameplay aside from lessons, in fact, I'd say the rest day is where you'll be spending a good amount of time aside from the lessons to increase your daughter's stats.

It also has a lot of characters that you can befriend, duel, date and of course, marry. All of them I found to be very interesting and likable (yes all), and I enjoyed being able to marry them and still have a career at the same time. Also, this game is great for having poly marriage ends for some candidates. Never saw that in a SIM game and I applaud them for doing so.

Now for the Cons of this game. The translations are not that great. They are readable but you can tell it's not polished but it shouldn't ruin the game for you.

Also, it has too few save files, for a stat-raising game it should have more than 8-10 save files in case we need to backtrack...

Overall, if you loved princess maker, you will also love this game, it's fun, engaging, and has a lot of replayability.",1683330416,1683330416,True,69,0,0.809499084949493408,0,True,False,False

Finishing the game once took me around seven hours, and there are fifty-two endings! So you're in for a treat if you're a completionist. On top of that, there's no weirdly romantic father-daughter relationship happening. It's simply a wholesome relationship between you (the father) and your daughter. 
Unfortunately, the English translation isn't exactly the best. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what is happening due to poor translation, but it's not impossible.
I recommend the game if you enjoyed princess maker or are interested in trying out this game.

I do discuss this in the review, and while I still personally like the game- it has a MASSIVE * on it for this. This game is incredibly disrespectful to the daughter. There is a lot of borderline harassment in the form of ""love letters"". If you were abused growing up; as much as this game is actually fairly fun either avoid reading said letters or avoid the game all together. Fair warning.

There is a very niche collection of game titles starting with the Princess Maker series. They are like a combination of an incremental game and a roguelike, though they predate both concepts. The genre is a subset of a life sim I call a ""raising simulator"". Volcano Princess does its best to recreate this niche but well defined genre in a way which has both positives and negatives. 

During this review, I will be comparing this game to others in the genre; for comparison's sake I have played the following games in this genre. Princess Maker 2, Ciel Fledge and Growing Up. I will be referring to each of these titles throughout the review; but I assume that this applies to other games in the genre too. 

First the good; Volcano Princess does a fantastic job at creating an accessible life sim; capturing the appeal of the original Princess Maker rather well. It contains all the same hallmarks and more; you schedule your child's day, explore the town, dungeon dive and more! Unlike Ciel Fledge, the game doesn't punish you for wanting to explore, and instead does a good job at encouraging it. Every day you are wasting time and resources if you don't first explore the town, talk to people and do your best to participate in one of the many side activities you slowly unlock as your daughter ages. It has a solid and refined Visual Novel element, with many ways you can interact with each person, even if it does seem a little too checklisty at times. Of particular note is both the dungeon crawling and cooking systems; which play off eachother well to provide an alternative method of levelling your stats. 

Most of your primary stat gains occur not during your scheduled timeslots, but during the exploration element. You must make choices using your stamina on if you refine skills or participate in activities; though the game is not very restrictive in this due to the aforementioned cooking system. Over time you gain ingredients which either buff your skills directly, or increase your action points allowing you to participate in more stat or money making activities. The schedule side focuses more on completing a series of ""classes""- similar to the skills system in ""Growing Up"", but with the addition of various ""Extra Curriculars"" that provide additional abilities and even buffs to your character. Speaking of buffs, beyond those unlocked through normal play, Volcano Princess includes multiple other forms of progression. Combat Levelling for you (and any companions you befriend high enough to battle with you in one of four selected dungeons),  Skills, which unlock with skill points over time and unlock other additional gamechanging modifiers to double or improve rewards in places you would like, mind body and charisma tokens (gained when completing courses, make activities better and unlock new content), guild achievements, regular achievements and more. Honestly I am absolutely impressed by the wide range of progression options throughout this game. I haven't even mentioned all of them, as every single activity levels up, new places unlock- there is a whole horse breeding minigame which is both easy and rewarding... Gawd. The game is both too long and too short at the same time to be honest. 

Unlike something like Ciel Fledge which lasts for an entire ten year spread; Volcano Princess has several time skips which lead to you feeling rather cheated as you seem to feel like part of your daughter's childhood was stolen away from them. What's worse is that while the art for your daughter does mildly change over time, the spritework keeps her looking like a tiny baby throughout the entire game. What's worse is, all of her various love interests can be met when she is very young, and unlike the aforementioned Ciel Fledge, they do NOT age over time with you, instead already seem like young adults right from when your daughter is 10. Not only does it seem really strange that your daughter can randomly date a bunch of people who are much MUCH older than her; the number of creepy and disturbing letters she gets throughout is... disgusting. 

These letters are to the point where, despite liking the gameplay very much, I stopped paying any attention to the dialogue outside of important events. Everyone will hit on your daughter even from age 10, she gets loads of creepy letters from guys saying how they would die for her- and there isn't even any way to say to eff off. No, you get to say thank you, and get a mood boost from reading a wall of disgusting messages. This would honestly be a massive red flag and even a total dealbreaker if I was unlucky enough to had been involved in this sort of stuff while growing up. Instead I just chalked it up to a cultural difference I don't understand. While this game isn't as abusive in its narrative as Ciel Fledge can be, it is still a big downer that I hope can be improved with further localisation. You are allowed to be a good dad, but due to the way the game arbitrarily decides the meaning of ""gentle"" and ""kind""- it can be VERY hard to get a top dad score your first playthrough... and anything to do with bravery and such is much easier to nail down than gentle and kind, at least in my experience. 

In more ""stuff that bothers me likely caused by a cultural difference more than anything""- the religious overtones in this game are far far too much. Everything in this place is belief, religion and nothing aside. Even the so called ""science"" pathway is just a ""faith"" pathway. While this isn't a problem in of itself, it does end up being very much on the nose. You have no choice but to either follow the religion entirely- or get too much ""darkness"". What does ""darkness"" do you may ask? Literally nothing but lock you out from some of the best endings unless you repent or entirely avoid anything the game deems as dark. I can understand some jobs in a bathhouse may involve too much skin for a small child sure, but you also get darkness from acting, fighting crimes, stating any kind of opposition to authority. Thankfully, most of the worst options the dad can say also bequeaths the penalty too, which is positive. But I didn't like how central the religious themes were. It really gave me the sense that this society really wasn't going to progress at all, and the world that my child was in would continue to be horrible regardless of her options. The temple is one of the most important places in the game, due in part to the darkness mechanic, but also due to it being the home to the only way to trade fame into free course completion. Given the limited time of the game, this is annoyingly unavoidable. 

Anyway, back to the good to finish off. The game is fun, open, and not overly difficult. While I still prefer Growing Up (due to the length, freedom, music and more contemporary setting), I do think Volcano Princess is worth a look if you like these sort of games and don't feel as bothered by the- troubling elements. I hope that given its positive reception, we start to see some patches for the game to improve the localisation to remove these issues; and flesh out the game more (even through DLC, I'd pay for more if it offered enough incentive).

Pros: 
-Skill tree of sorts
-Hella options on who you can romance/marry including characters that lean more towards NPC vs buddy characters 
-romance girls too
-romance ending with more than just 1 character/poly-romance ending
-gems or whatever you earn base on each playthrough score that you can use to increase base stats & relations with characters, + bonus features for better game enjoyment 
-archive with all the ending CGs give you clear-cut hints on how to achieve specific endings to make it easier for you
-outfits have stats to help instead of being just cosmetic

Cons:
-""Skill tree"" but it's not too expansive (but also understandable)
-Redundancy after your 1st playthrough but it's to be expected
-can't skip long CG cuts
-limited energy bar (can be overcome by stocking up on energy-boosting food but that only goes so far)

Grand Takeaway:
Definitely a lot of replay value even if it does get a little redundant  
I personally recommend saving before you end the game so you can go back to unlock other endings to the same playthrough to save yourself time

That's how the game starts at least, but as your daughter hits a certain age you start playing as her instead for the most part. But the goal remains the same, with your actions, choices of studies, and friendships you try to sculpt an independent grown-up with a set of goals, morals, and a profession.

A passion project with an extremely small team, Volcano Princess was released with some substantial bugs. But even so, this is a solid and beautifully presented dating sim. There's a huge quantity of art; there's substantial breadth of options for activities, love interests, and endings; it is not punishing, so it's easy to jump in and you won't totally screw up your first run if you don't come in armed with a spreadsheet; each playthrough takes a while but is not a laboriously long slog; I especially appreciate that it has a New Game+ feature, so every playthrough can assist you with your next one, if you choose to take advantage of that feature.

You should know that gameplay is very, VERY heavily RNG-based, and you can only save at the end of a turn (one month). This makes it very difficult to pre-plan your runs in detail; instead, it encourages you instead to have a flexible, broader-picture strategy and roll with the punches. There's pros and cons to this. I find it a bit aggravating, but typically, if RNG throws off your plan you'll have time to recover.

Because this is a small indie game, the breadth of options available does mean that they tend to be a bit shallow. I wish love interests and career paths had a bit more depth and distinction from one another, but this is only a small complaint.

The English translation is variable; it appears they have a fluent translator for some sections while others are not fluently translated. Unfortunately, the introduction to the game is one of the poorly translated sections, giving a first impression of a slapdash job. But, over the 1.5 weeks it's been out, the devs have been really involved not just fixing bugs but improving the translation. Such a level of love and care on the part of the devs is unlike pretty much every raising sim I've looked at.

8/10 game. The game is way too good for its price. A lot of things to achieve.

-It's the closest you'll get to modern day Princess Maker
-It feels like the devs understand PM and what makes it fun
-Visually, this game is gorgeous with a lot of polish
-The game is very good as guiding you without holding your hand
-A diverse set of cast and things to do
-The game supports a lot of replayability, with NG+ essentially in the form of a points shop
-You won't feel punished like in classic PM games or LLtQ for not knowing exactly how to invest in your daughter in advance
-Bisexuality and polyamory are neat things you don't get in a lot of otome games
-You get to develop a relationship with your daughter without Gainax's creepy touch
-The game did not take me a week during lockdown to no-life marathon one single playthrough unlike PM5

The bad:
-Despite the amount of things to do, you inevitably will find it stale after a playthrough or two. This has less to do with the diversity of options, and more to do with the depth of those options
-The game is so good at guiding you that there isn't really a lot of secret things for you to discover. Unless you're aiming for endings/romance routes, one playthrough where you dip your toes into everything basically will be all you need to experience everything
-NG+ makes it way too easy to get endings, but achieving any of the prestigious endings without them is pretty rough
-The combat is pretty unbalanced. Your girl's 3-hit DoT skill and Ze's stunlocking are basically all you need to cheese everything. I just brought Kenneth to tank hits for those two, and healers are a wasted slot.
-While not as bad as the infamous Steam translations for the PM games, it can be rough at time and makes understanding the plot a bit harder than it should be
-The game pauses when you're tabbed out. There is nothing about this game that happens in real time other than being forced to watch animations in contests.  
-You also cannot fast forward text in a text-heavy game that encourages replays. 

Overall the game was absolutely worth 10 bucks even if I only did one or two playthroughs (I did more. You're talking to someone who played through the behemoth that is PM5 in a week.) Also as someone who went ""I want to marry Gwynneth. Oh, a lot of her interactions involve her brother? Let's also raise his relationship too,"" I absolutely got blindsided with a wiffle bat achieving THAT romance ending.

The game is a bit off beat in that it's translations can be rough sometimes, but it shouldn't bother anyone who isn't a stickler or struggles to read English. Sometimes I'd pause and get mentally stuck cause I'm a bit of a literalist, but then I'd laugh at myself about it. The mechanics are great and fun, and I feel there is a lot of replayability due to the impact of RNG on the game. It's not too hard, and there is a 1-3 run learning curve if you're an optimizer like myself, but there is room for creative approaches. After you beat the game once you can add legacy traits/boosts which significantly help the freedom of choice for how to direct your princess' lifestyle and choices/interests. The storyline is really cute and enjoyable and I think there are some secrets to be found there depending on what ending you get or what you focus on and there is definitely enough content to explore. 

The only negatives I have is that some parts of the mini games are not skippable, but honestly it's not that big of a deal. 

The voice acting isn't in english but it seems pretty good for someone who doesn't speak those languages. 

The support team has continued to work on and fix bugs they find which is a good sign. Personally I've had no bugs or issues playing the game, and look forward to any updates they may add. :)

其实在开始游戏之前让我嫁女儿我内心是拒绝的，（但谁知道竟然可以百合！！！）但谁知道成功的角色塑造地让人难以拒绝它。游戏里地恋爱，不突兀，不娇柔做作，不时间管理（时间管理可能还是有那么一点点额），美丽阳光勤奋（勤奋是我逼的）又善于聆听的小公主用真诚、时间、与善良一步步加深与生活中值得珍惜的人们的羁绊，这些关系和与朋友的记忆“像金子一样在记忆里闪闪发光”。擅长照顾人，但时常显得神秘寂寞的莫娜姐姐；聪慧美丽、优秀能干杰出、严于律己，但内心十分渴求信任、友情、与爱的公主；冷峻沉默、悲伤勇敢，在情感上果断忠诚的泽；除了这些讨喜的标签外，他们都懂得珍重身边的人，珍惜友谊与爱情，以不同的表现形式散发着人性美好的光。以上所有，让这个游戏的感情结局水到渠成，修成正果的主角，留给人以有情人终成眷属的感慨
。
一周目一开始处处碰壁确实很气馁，但坚持拿着剧院一半的收入，一步一步的攒钱攒经验，最终S级演出信手拈来是真的很有成就感。二周目之后就开启了凤傲天模式，所有活动（指探险，赛马，舞台之类的）都轻松杀穿，开始有计划地学习、消费，始终向着一个美好而不平凡的未来迈进，为之努力奋斗。老婆（请务必让我这么称呼doge）一遍又一遍的尝试，见证了24次双女的死亡，她说：“我感觉自己太笨了。”但爱的慰藉与支撑让她始终不放弃对幸福的追求，这份追求，可能就是火山女神与她女儿口中的“偏执”，也是所有坐在屏幕前玩家全心投入、不断尝试的原因： 一个平凡或不平凡 的 幸福的 美好的 为之奋斗的 生活。
所以说我家小公主和小天使天下无敌第一（并列）可爱！！！！！


最后凭着残缺的记忆聊一聊勇者和剧情。首先，我是没有打学园长线和恶堕线的，所以关于应该是缺少了部分剧情关键信息的（尤其是那个大退化和那个石碑），但就姑且这么谈把。我个人对勇者的定性是：可悲之人。至于可不可怜，就确实有待讨论了。其实小公主最后信中表达的对勇者（当然在啥都不知道的憨憨老爹前叫的是雷贝莎）的情感是倾向可怜的。小公主将勇者称呼为自己的朋友，虽然总抱怨她阴晴不定。小公主说她对勇者的感情比较复杂，小公主窥见、也或多或少理解了勇者“疯“之下的痛苦与挣扎；他/她千真万确的伤害了小公主的家庭，但他/她的痛苦也是真实的，他/她对小公主也真的动了情，也曾真的想过说和小公主一起做一个平凡的骑士（勇者战之前这里说的应该是勇者的压力，但勇者战之后回头来看其实应该是指的是对永生与力量漫长的痛苦追寻（毕竟勇者说自己打架其实挺爽的，所以大概不会讨厌打架）），但无论如何，他/她最终还是在这一条痛苦的罪孽之路走了下去，他/她杀死我老婆（doge）（其实也没杀死）（打个岔，红石头不是加幸运吗？要红的干嘛？？？），对小天使下手，注定了他/她的罪恶，也注定了他/她的结局。我认为勇者是可悲而可怜的，可怜在他/她疯狂之下的软弱与痛苦。

剧情方面先列举一些事实和推测把（可能措辞不是很准确）欢迎指正：
关于夺舍事件：
1.	发生在小鸟节，勇者说的，与之对应的是游戏一章结尾的落崖事件
2.	女儿（不知道是哪一个）在该事件落崖，父亲也落崖，父亲没死，留下了腿伤
3.	父亲在夺舍事件前后始终都只有一个女儿的记忆
4.	夺舍之后姐姐的灵魂仍残存在身体里（勇者的说法）

关于神力
1.	打倒魔兽会掉落红石头和紫石头。游戏中的红石头可以带来幸运，紫石头可以强化等级。勇者最后吸收/使用了母亲掉的红石头，称之为“鲜活的力量”，并说他生前最后只能靠这个才能存活，而姐姐的“身体”“充满“了这种力量，而妹妹的“身体”则毫无这种力量。
2.	姐姐提到，妹妹继承了凡人的躯体，无法承载神力，并且导致了妹妹其他世界线的死亡，虽然没说24次分别是啥原因死的，但这至少是最根本最初始的原因。讲堂里《不祥的邪术》提到的“对宿主十分要求苛刻“指的应该是不是神力，不然几乎不可能有成功的先例，更不用提文字记载。合理的推测是，红紫石头中存在的力量应该属于类似于某种生命力的力量，这种力量是魔兽表现出来，而正常人表现不明显的，而神力表现出很强的这种力量
3.	姐姐被夺舍后“灵魂”仍然存在（虽然勇者的灵魂在肉体灭了之后就散了）（一开始在勇者身体里），“灵魂“仍然拥有”力量“，尽管“力量”被削弱了，但力量可以恢复，恢复之后有能力再创造身体（关于这一点，姐姐的说法是很简单，不排除安慰妹妹的可能性高，但看无勇者战结局，确实是又造了一个身体，至少不会很难）。推测，“灵魂“是不依附于”肉体“存在的，勇者的最终死亡可以用失去了肉体，而灵魂没有能力创造肉体（不像姐姐）所以”消散在森林中“来解释。妹妹和勇者一样时常也梦到姐姐最后姐姐跑出来救场，总结也支持这个说法，而勇者说的姐姐”灵魂“残存在他/她身体里，不过是他/她片面的一家之言
4.	尽管“身体”毫无神力，但妹妹依然成神了。那么问题来了，妹妹到底有没有神力？个人认为比较合理的解释是出生是没有的，但在后天成长的过程中，不管说是四值三值的成长，还是说吸收了红紫石头升级了，还是妈妈又想出了什么法子，或者三者兼有之，使身体可以承受神力。综合姐姐，应该和三值四值没什么关系（毕竟像爸爸所以笨应该是玩笑话）。

关于母亲之“死“
1.	母亲是在结婚10周年纪念日之后“死“的
2.	母亲“死”前和父亲一起起了“名字“，推测是双胞胎，所以怀孕期间只取了一个“名字”
，长得很一模一样可以佐证，小天使说“我们的名字“也可以佐证，所以婚后十年再生孩子就当一开始没心情吧。
3.	母亲“死“前（推测在怀孕期间）进行了分草药事件，推测（这个基本上等于是事实）这里是在推演拯救两个女儿的方法（也就是说如果确实是双胞胎那这里已经知道了），母亲说草药混在一起，父亲用滤纸将两种草药分开了。大谜语人。这里可能暗指将两个女儿的命运分开，这解释了为什么玩家一直只看到了妹妹，但这目前并不能解释为什么让她们走向被分开的路线（姐姐被夺舍）对妹妹会有一丁点好处。还可能暗指将所有的神力都分给姐姐，这能很好解释怎么救下女儿，但这个暗指本身有点牵强。更重要的是，这两点都目前不能很好的解释为什么妈妈要离开。
4.	游戏中没有提及母亲死亡的时间及原因，只是在草药回忆后说“如果当时多注意你的身体“暗示了是难产（虽然根本不对）。这种模糊化处理可以理解为父亲对于母亲的死亡本身就是模糊的，只是潜意识地将其合理化了。这里可以推测是母亲的神力干预的结果，也同时可以作为父亲记忆中只有一个女儿的解释，那么问题就来了，分别是为什么？一个合理的推测要回到上一条，即母亲发现拯救两个女儿的方法是将她们的命运分开，让父亲养妹妹，母亲养姐姐，（而且事实证明这是成功的，不论有没有经历勇者战事件，姐妹和父亲都活了下去）而为了这样一个设计，需要给身为凡人的父亲和妹妹一点合理的背景，而母亲和姐姐，身为神，是知晓这一切的。
5.	当然上一个问题想讲清楚要涉及另一个问题，即究竟是什么威胁了姐妹的生命。我们知道只要完成了勇者战事件，母亲就“活“了（不过我不知道该事件中途放弃会发生什么，欢迎补充），而没触发，就一直”死“着。结合其他内容考虑，可以推测勇者是主要威胁。勇者夺舍了姐姐活了下去，或许姐姐确实没有死，但放任勇者这样下去终究是个威胁。然而作为一个平民家庭，理应无论是说实力还是权势都无法与勇者抗衡的，所以就只能作为魔兽之主物理外耗，然后姐姐精神内耗。在结局中，要么把勇者耗死了；要么就一直这样僵持了下去，没让勇者对家庭造成更多伤害了。所以从结果论来看，这是很合理的。另外，从父亲的性格，从始至终的生活（包括各种结局），以及妹妹生而为人的事实，都表明了南港的小房子才是夫妻享受与追求的安稳的不用不平凡的幸福，因此从始至终母亲都没有公开自己身份的打算（导致最后只有憨憨父亲蒙在鼓里），这是母亲选择离开的考量之一。题外话，母亲对父亲的爱与信任让她能将妹妹托付给他，相信他能凭坚强与爱培育浇灌他们最可爱的小公主，让她健康、开心的长大。

关于大退化
1.	人与动物都会发生大退化，动物会变成魔物，掉落红紫石头，人会长出羽毛、改变骨骼结构（目前只有这一种现象）。
2.	首先是动物发生了大退化、再是父亲、再是其他人类。推测是跟地理位置有关。
3.	父亲说，大退化是“出于‘某人的意志‘”；母亲（罪魁祸首）说，大退化是因为“太想团圆了”。
4.	综合以上，推测大退化和神力有关，可能和母亲无意识的神力释放有关（因为思念或伤痛）。这也再一次印证了神力中关于红紫石头中力量和神力有关的观点。

玩了这么多结局果然还是喜欢格温妮斯，公主x公主天下第一！！！！！！

Additional Thoughts:

At this point i have only gotten one of the many endings to this game and what it does as a ""Princess Maker"" Successor is done well. although i have only ever played PM2 so far, and i want to try the other games in the series but if you enjoyed at least PM2 then you will like this one. 

although i think there should be somewhere (unless i missed it) that tells you that the entire year was one season, i didnt realize thats how the seasons worked until i reached the 4th year.

The translation is a slight mess, its understandable enough. the translation is getting checked over as of writing this review. there are a few bugs that will freeze the game at the moment as well but those are getting fixed as well.",1682834462,1682834462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is like Princess Maker in terms of its gameplay, but Volcano Princess is so much better than Princess Maker in a way that I don't need to strictly follow steps that other players summarized to collect all the endings, and I can discover the game all by myself without missing any events on the way. There is also no need to struggle on decision makings for pursuing a specific ending because I can get them all in one try. This game's save&load mechanism is a big awesome since the save&load is not going to make dramatic changes to the gameplay (which, I usually do a lot of save&load for other similar games, to trigger special character events, for example).

The bad first, because there aren't many:
- Some of the story bits felt a bit rushed, even though I appreciate what they are trying to do.
- It's a bit of a chore to click on everyone in every location each break to accumulate friendship or inspiration.

The good:
- Beautiful, consistent art style
- Good world building in character dialogues, felt a generous amount of inter-connection in the writing of the dialogues from different characters, as well as connection to world events
- Interesting twist on years and seasons
- Intriguing main story, even if a bit rushed at parts in execution
- I liked the music
- Overall, the design felt rich with a lot of things to do, good and constant feedback, many mini goals and rewards.  Probably the best I've seen from this genre
- Full of heart, shows through

First play-thru takes roughly ten hours and each subsequent play-thru is shorter because you don't need to read all the text (and you know what you're doing!)

* Dozens of Endings
* Each time you beat the game you earn points to spend to give bonuses for the next play-thru

* Devs have been really communicative and are fixing bugs regularly

The Cons:
* Repetitive Combat with a only few viable strategies and party make-ups
* Currently no skip functions for dialog (etc...) to speed up repeat play-thrus

Neutral:
* Translation - this has been a huge complaint from players.

[b] Overview [/b]

Volcano Princess is a raising simulator where you plan how your daughter spends their time which will consequently raise various stats. After a certain amount of turns, what stats you have will determine what ending you get i.e what profession your daughter pursues as an adult. 
If you're already familiar with raising sims, Volcano Princess is very similar to Princess Maker 5, another game that I love but wouldn't recommend to people. VP takes the town and character interactions of PM5 and applies it to the month to month planning basis of Princess Maker 2 and Long Live the Queen. It also is much simpler than those other titles as you won't be juggling nearly as many stats. I personally prefer the more in depth stat building that PM5, PM2 and LLTQ offer, however this does mean that Volcano Princess would likely be more friendly to beginners.

[b] Pros [/b]

The art is gorgeous and the presentation is generally very strong.
The combat is fun and doesn't feel like an afterthought (also Ze OP).
I like the cast a lot. Kenneth is my favourite, he's cute. 
Even though there are less stats, I still got the ""number go up, brain happy"" feeling.
The inclusion of Hades-style level ups to increase your daughters stats for the next run is a genuinely very cool addition.
[i] Some [/i] of the icky elements of Princess Maker have thankfully been left in the trash. Notably you can't romance your own daughter here and the CGs don't overtly sexualize her. I'm looking at you Princess Maker 2 and your vacation CGs.
Also your daughter can date girls!

[b] Cons [/b]

Let's get the ones that everyone else has mentioned out of the way first: bugs and the English translation. Once again Volcano Princess is very similar to Princess Maker 5.

For the bugs, the auto-save does a lot of heavy lifting here to avoid too much frustration as you will likely come across a game breaking bug or two. Also speaking of saves, it's very annoying that you can't save in the middle of a turn.
As for the English translation, yes it is very clunky. I feel similarly about VP's translation as I do about PM5's: very clearly grammatically incorrect however, as it's not broken enough impede on my ability to enjoy the characters, so I'm willing to let it slide. The only place where unfortunately it did negatively impact my enjoyment of the story is [spoiler] the ending where you beat up Owl Princess, Lebsa and Asbel [/spoiler] In summary, on a moment to moment basis, the English translation didn't bother me but it did get in the way of me feeling the full impact of the big story beats.

Ok so now for the big thing that's been killing the game for me: [i] why are half of the love interests so much older than the daughter? [/i]

With the exception of Craig and Nina the other love interests are either in their late teens at the start and adults by the end or well into their adult years. Like Hackett, my man, I love you but stop flirting with my 12 year old daughter, you're 19. 
It sits really badly with me and as a result I feel painfully aware of how much older these characters are then my daughter everytime I interact with them. And because the stat building is so bare compared to Princess Maker, most of the gameplay for me has been in interacting with the cast therefore making the problem feel even worse. 
Like, the daughter dating in PM is [i] bad [/i] and I hate it but at least if I wasn't actively pursuing it I could ignore it very easily. It feels worse when you consider that PM5 has a gross romancable adult  - the idol manager guy - but once again it was easily ignorable if I didn't pursue it. Here I can't bring myself to do that. It's especially frustrating because, like I've said already, game gets rid of other icky parts of PM like the daughter dating and yet why does it doubles down on this one?
Also as a side note, the characters who are of the same or close age to the daughter are very clearly not designed with being 13 in mind. If the game told me that Benson, Hackett, Mona, Rebecca and Gwyneth were only a year older or the same age as the daughter I would be totally willing to suspend my disbelief like I'm already doing for Craig. You cannot convince me that that design is for a boy any younger than 17 but again, I can suspend my disbelief. Or hell, if the game didn't tell me their ages at all I probably would've been fine with it.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

While I have been comparing Volcano Princess to Princess Maker 5 for most of this review, really my experience with it has felt closer to Little Witch Romanesque. While Volcano Princess is not nearly as bad as Little Witch - which I did one run of and immediately dropped - the gross parts are still too overt and unavoidable to me to properly find enjoyment in the good game and beautiful art underneath.

I fell in love with the game when the first demo was out and the full game didn't disappoint my expectations. This is probably the one heir to the Princess Maker series that best captures what made Princess Maker II so lovely. 

The game is far from perfect. The english translation can be improved a lot and some areas of the game could use a bit more fleshing out. The combat system against the demons is among the most detailed parts of the game and it gets the job done just fine. It's about the right amount of complexity to keep you engaged without the battles becoming too tiresome. 

The music sets the scene just fine and some themes like the one at the volcano lake are just so adorable that I am always staying longer in the scene than neccessary just to let the tranquility set in some more.

The game had a few debilitating bugs at the start but the devs are quick to apply fixes and seem very engaged. At the current pricing you can't go wrong if you enjoyed similar games.",1682595249,1682595249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't say I didn't have fun! that's why i'm recommending it, but you have to be aware there are a lot of cons, and that's not just in the translation/story. 

firstly, there are elements of the game that just aren't finished/don't work. the ending is disappointingly bare bones, and i know you're supposed to play it again, but after all that you just get a letter summarising her life. it's also VERY buggy right now. i had it crash a few times and at the moment you're not supposed to start the game without turning off cloud saving, which is disappointing for a fully released game. i know this is a very small team though, and i'm overall impressed despite all of this, which is pretty crazy, because there are massive flaws. i also found the (thankfully mild) sexualisation of the daughter uncomfortable... and why are all these older people hitting on her when she's 12 years old?

the translation being bad i mostly just found really funny actually, but there are times where it's a genuine hindrance, like performing in the theatre. i didn't understand what was supposed to be the 'romantic' options, or 'hopeful', or whatever, because they didn't really make sense most of the time. the same problem arises in responding to letters. 

also, i found the music repetitive and annoying, and turned it off pretty quickly to play my own music in the background. 

the relationship between the father and daughter is sweet, but again, the story is one of the worst parts of the game, which is a shame because if it wasn't, this game could be incredible. anyway, again, i'd only recommend this to specific kinds of people, if you're like me and just like management style life sims. it scratched that right itch for me. i also like that you can marry whoever you want regardless of their gender, but i'd say it mostly doesn't matter because all the characters are so one dimensional and all you get is a few confusing and poorly written cut scenes that i found myself speeding through from boredom. a great work of literature this is not. but a fun game? sure.",1682579931,1682581822,True,3,1,0.550408720970153809,0,True,False,False

I binged this game for about 48 hours and still plan on playing more. im not the type to like reading unnecessary dialogue, but this was an exception. every character feels unique and most of them feel very fleshed out and well developed. i found myself getting attached to them all and naturally wanting to complete all of their endings to see what would happen instead of only for the achievement. the true ending feels fulfilling and leaves you wanting to replay the game (as you should) to understand the additional context, which is perfect for a game like this. also, of course, the art is wonderfully done. the gameplay is engaging and addicting in the way it should be. the gameplay loop is just short enough to convince yourself to play one more day for hours on end. additionally, the upgrades feel substantial and worthwhile to take as well, and are a good motivation to play over and over again. i love it!

at the time of this review there are a lot of translation errors and soft-locking bugs that do take away from the overall experience. as it stands, the game is an 8/10 overall with potential to be a 10/10 for anyone who likes princess maker games if they get around to fixing the errors and bugs, which it appears they are doing from the looks of their active discord server with many people contributing to finding and fixing said problems :) very hopeful for the potential here. would absolutely love to see more games like this one and i will be on the lookout for more games by these developers.",1682536465,1682536465,True,2,0,0.515625,0,True,False,False

 I love 'child raising simulator' games which have been hard to find in English. The 'Princess Maker' series aside, I enjoyed 'Long live the Queen', 'Chinese Parents',  and 'Cute Bite'. 'Volcano Princess' has similarities to these, but also includes a more 'fleshed out' world than I typically see, lots of mini-games (which range from 'that's cute' to 'thanks I hate it') MANY characters and an interesting plot. As is usual for the genre how you raise your daughter, which classes she takes, what activities she does, who she befriends and what attributes she levels up, will determine what possible endings are offered to her when she hits 18.

There game at release had many bugs, and one or two more were added when the old bugs were fixed. The dev team seems to be working REALLY hard to fix bugs as fast as possible, and have been responsive to community feedback, so I'm confident these issues will be fixed very quickly. 

The English translation has some typos and can be a little hit and miss. Having done translation work myself, I recognise it's more an art than a science. Some scenes and dialogue come across stilted because while the literal translation is there, it does not flow naturally. Occasional events, conversations or plot points can be pretty baffling for this reason. That said at time of writing the story and events are largely understandable, and the devs have made it clear that the English translation will see significant improvement, but with such a massive amount of text, this will take time. 

All in all I heartily recommend the game to anyone who enjoys the genre or wants to try it.",1682519012,1682519012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still, that doesn't mean it wasn't a pretty fun game.  I enjoyed a first play through and then a new game+ for the ""perfect"" ending.

The attribute system is greatly simplified as compared to PM2.  In some ways this is a good thing, as it is much easier to understand for new players.  In some ways this is the worst thing about the game.  It's so easy to just max everything (especially on new game+) that you can make one character to tour all the top tier endings without much trouble.  This tanks the replay value as compared to PM2, where getting any top tier ending involved careful planning to meet the requirements and ""just maxing everything"" was a pipe dream.

The romance system was the same old thing used since original Harvest Moon, you can chat and gift people once a day, so no points for originality.  However it fits well in this sort of game, and it's as functional as it has always been.

One point where is surpasses PM2 is the UI.  PM2 was mostly just a set of lists that let you pick what you wanted to do.  In Volcano Princess, different actions are performed in different places in and around town, so you actually have to travel to those different places to do things instead of just selecting them from a list.  It gives the game a bit more personality and makes the game world feel larger.

Overall, while it is an inferior game, it's still a fun game.  I enjoyed my two plays, and while it doesn't have any replay value beyond that, it still made for a good 24 hours of game time.  I recommend it to fans of the genre.",1682506558,1682506558,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1) (FIXED) being stuck the letter opening screen and unable to get out without restarting the whole game (and potentially losing all my game progress for that month)
2) being unable to advance my knight quests at all upon receiving them throughout the duration of the entire game

I really enjoy playing this game and big shout out also huge thanks to the creator for making this game even though there are still bugs currently but in overall this game really makes me addicted and fully enjoy it~

So how about you guys try it? :D

*ehem* Recently i'm writing this, i finally got my very first playthrough ending.
Just as i getting closer and closer to the end especially the end-ceremony; i can't help but start to think ""ah it's finally time to let my little daughter continue her life...""
and when the graduation itself i was like ""Yesss i will continue support you now and in the future (start to shed tears""). Then, later this game hit me with the most Brilliant Move!! that is
""letter from my daughter came in after 4 years telling her current life with full of happiness and love"" .....

They MASSIVELY dropped the ball on the endings though. 
If steam had a good rating system that alone would make me drop this from a 9/10 to a 6/10.

At the end you need to chose from one of  5 categories without knowing whats in them without being able to go back after picking one and then you are presented with a bunch of random text that doesn't really correlate with the respective job.
Now that already sounds annoying but the best part about it is that you don't actually get to choose at all!
Every random text blurb has like 5 different jobs associated with it and which one you get is determined by EIGHTEEN different skills/numbers. 
Have too much of one skill? Tough luck you are locked out of that ending forever.
[u]This system is completely unusable without a guide. [/u]
Going 100% without a guide would take easily hundreds of hours that's like asking a blind man to sort marbles by color you are just stumbling through the dark.

This completely ruined the game for me. 
I was ready to do a few runs for all the endings but with this system it would just be me micromanaging 18 numbers comparing it with the guide spreadsheet and spamming through the entire games dialogue (no skip function) just so I can get the ""Slightly worse knight than the other ending""-ending.

I have no idea why they went out of their way to make the ending system a black box full of knifes this is actively malicious in how bad it is.
PLEASE JUST GIVE ME A LIST OF ALL THE JOBS AVAILABLE

I haven't played a raising simulator since ""Long Live The Queen"" because I was so disappointed by how short and limited it was, but it is so adorable raising the daughter in this game, to see how she grows from your actions, to play with her or teach her influences how she'll view life later on, it is very adorable, even just the very little I've played so far.

There are problems with bugs and the english translation isn't perfect (""Daughter, what's up?"" to 5 year old daughter xD ) but the developers of the game are active right now, trying to iron out all the problems, and even have proposed bug fixes of their own to avoid certain bugs until they can officially iron them out in an update. I think that's awesome, especially considering usually developers just dip on their games, and only come back when the initial sales dip due to the problems. These guys just released the game, are selling massive numbers, and they are still committed to ensuring the game is perfect for everyone. I really like that dedication to their art :)

I'm sure people would expect this review to lose points for bugs and the awkward english, but it's $10 USD, that's not a high price to pay at all for all the sweet and beautiful content you get here. Plus, I would like to direct your eyes towards the achievements and oh hell yeah that is 200 and 30 achievemnets. 230 achievements. For a $10 USD game. That's pretty damn impressive IMO. Marking each milestone, and the many, many endings you can get, it's pretty damn impressive :)

10/10 absolutely recommend, especially at the 'introductory price' because that's even below the $10.99 USD.

This is the successor to Princess Maker 2 that you have been looking for. 

Not only do you actually feel involved with your daughter's life, but your daughter actually feels like she has autonomy in the things she wants and does, even if you are technically controlling them for her. There's many options in where to take her life, though not enough that it becomes overwhelming and every ending becomes another box to tick; every run feels special.

Sure, there are handful of games out there that are well enough, but in my opinion none of them ever come close to Princess Maker... until Volcano Princess. Playing this game brings back that sense of nostalgia from my childhood, and unlike other recent games there is a clear true ending to strive for. It brings new mechanics into an old genre and it fits so well together. 

Now, I will say a few things. I really recommend this game, but I feel I do need to point out that out of the few playthroughs I've done now I have come across a few bugs. The most notable one is the fact that letters will come in  and if you click on it the words will not appear and it will break the game. There has been a fix created to help with this. However, another bug I came to was the fact that my game was seemingly skipping over the ""Volcano Festival."" I'm still trying to figure out if this has something to do with the fact that I changed my birthday month in my second playthrough and it skipped over the month of October because of it. Either way, it is a bug that needs to be fixed. The festival is a big part of the lore and gameplay, and it feels like your missing out when you can't even go.

PROS:
Sophisticated stat system
Easy to understand
Areas in the town unlock as you progress through the game
Turn based combat 
Making friends that you take on adventures, each with different skills
Festivals that test your daughter, along with minigames
Wide variety of unique characters that feel like real people
Incredibly adorable father/daughter relationship. Also the option to be a bad dad
Lots of different paths for your daughter to go down, and  balanced with every gameplay
Unique story with its own twist. Choices you make heavily impact your daughter and story
Side quests in the Knights college that help advance your daughter in a certain direction
Lots of things to do in the town map
Romance is very in depth. The game also rewards you with gifts as you advance every relationship
Cooking and Crafting
Lots of straight and lesbian romance routes

CONS:
Dice minigame is hard to understand, even with the guide I'm still confused. I end up avoiding it every playthrough

Horse racing is very hard, even with novice races you have to have an extremely fast horse to win, which is not available until you have at least 40 MND. Also I spent like 2000 gold leveling up my horse and still couldn't win. Hopefully they make this more balanced

You can date practically everyone in the town. The reason I put this in the con section is because there are some weird match ups involving people a lot older than you, and you can start romancing these people once you hit age 12 lol. So yeah there are some huge age gaps and it gets kinda freaky for my taste. The only plus side is that you can't groom your own daughter like in the original PM2

No magic classes in the game. If you want to fight in the forest, you have to build up your STR, which sucks  because INT and CHA have no place in battle

This game is very long. It took me several days to finish one playthrough. I actually kind of like this because the game is very in depth, but I made it a con because some people may not like this when pursuing multiple endings

Battle requires a lot of grinding to progress, although they offset this by spending purple stones to level up characters not in use. The problem is that you have to grind to get the stones, and you can't purchase them

Overall I think this is a great addition to the Daughter Raising Simulator genre, and really scratches that itch I've been craving in a game for a while now. The only thing they could add to make this game perfect (imo) is the ability to decorate your room. I think it would be super cute to acquire different stuff to place in there to personalize it. They kinda do this with the Alchemy station, but you can't see any of the decorations visibly. That's just me though",1682394989,1682394989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Overall, this game is really fun. The characters are cute, drawn well and overall seem to have a lot of substance to them and some level of nuance. There's replay value in the fact that you can spend points from achievements gained on a run, to get higher starting base stats/items/etc to make the next run easier and hopefully to achieve that ""better"" ending or an ending that you are gunning for. 

The gameplay is rather simple. You have a certain amount of energy each day to do certain things, with ways of gaining more. As time goes on more and more, the character's daughter (your daughter) grows older with certain time skips at certain points throughout the game. You gain stats, skills, and subject scores in relation to the classes you take/the activites you do in the overworld. Or, instead you can spend energy fighting monsters in the forest, clearing out the corruption to hopefully find the ""Owl Princess"" to defeat the big bad. Or, you could become a socialite and try to enter nobility through social mingling. You can also grow food, catch horses and talk to citizens much like Fire Emblem Three houses did. Where you can talk, spend time with, duel in word play/actual battle, give gifts etc. There are certain activities like the ""dark alley"" that seemed put in last minute, that don't offer much to you and seem to be completely left field with art style. But not many have that issue. 

The music is very fitting for this game as well, and catchy at times though the lack of longer length tracks makes the second or third play through get rather depressing as once you heard the music once, that's it. 

The Arty style and art direction is great, the characters look awesome and the set pieces are well done with some art looking a little odd but nothing that looks out place (ignoring you dark alley, with your weird pixel based art)

But, all of this benefit, this great game packaged in a 10 dollar price tag is marred by the English Translation. At times it's passable, at other times it's so bad it's hard to understand why is being conveyed. As an example, during dates if you fill up all the ""romance"" points you get an option called ""ambiguous."" what that means, I'm not entirely sure other than you get higher rewards. 

I really love this game, I played it almost non stop for three days because I fell in love with what the game was, even if the English Translation was bad. However, not everyone will be able to sift through the confusingly structured sentences, the weird conveying of information and simply strange word translation that really hampers the enjoyment. At times, the translation won't even work giving the name 50C at one point for a character. To give the devs a lot of credit, it is only a two female team from China. The Translation at this point almost feels like a fault of the publisher rather than the devs. 

This game is easily worth the money if you can stand the translation, if that is concern give it a month or so and by then the translation should be up to snuff for any player. Easily one of the best games I've played this year, and I really hope a better translation comes out so I can truly appreciate what this dynamic duo was trying to make.",1682123191,1682380970,True,43,1,0.793996214866638184,0,True,False,False

1. Click windows + R and run %AppData%
2. Go back to the full AppData folder, the search will automatically take you to the roaming folder
3. Find LocalLow folder
4. Find Volcano Princess
5. Delete everything in the Volcano Princess folder. It is the one saving your corrupted save files. You have to delete all of it to get the game to work again.

After doing all of the that, my game is progressing again. Thank you devs for listening to us! I am leaving the old portion of my review below this.

I really wanted to like this game. The concept is cute, the characters are lively, the overall game has so much potential. Unfortunately, this game has game breaking bugs. To the point where it is actually unplayable. There are several people complaining about translation issues, and sure the English translation could be better, but there are two very specific bugs that most people seem to be having problems with. The letters you receive from other characters and when you try to tame a horse.

The letter bug you are able to bypass by not even entertaining the thought of clicking on it. Unfortunately, the horse bug completely crashes your game and breaks it. I can't even play the game anymore. It won't let me get past the opening sequence. There are people who keep saying to unpatch the game, to force it roll back to the old patch, but it does not work if your files are located Program Files (x86). As of right now, my game is actually unplayable.

I recommend saving your money until these bugs are completely fixed. I will change my review until I am able to play the game again.",1682294026,1682364911,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a story and what I do understand is interesting. However, I get the feeling that there's a bunch of stuff I'm just missing? Unless you're meant to just piece things together from npc gossip. There's a few major plot points that I'm just not really sure what the relevance was but that might be because in my first playthrough, I didn't do any combat at all. 

Now, I know this review seems negative so far but here's why I still recommend this game: the mechanics. I really enjoy the combat mechanics. They took a hot moment for me to figure out but it was super satisfying when I did. The stat grinding is also something I really liked, and this IS a stat grinding game so if that's not something you're into, you're probably not going to enjoy this experience very much. The pretty graphics don't hurt either.

This might not be a perfect game but it's one that I liked enough to sink about 12 hours straight in a single day.

The music is stock music taken from a sound library.

The art varies from very professional to quite bad, but you earn that good art. The bulk of your time is spent in really inconsistent play-dough looking characters and randomly one mode is pixel art.

The game was in no way designed for English letters. The translation is so bad, and some modes, like the aforementioned pixel art mode, take quite a lot of work to get to.

I feel kind of weird about some of the outfits you give to her, that provide necessary stat boosts.

The game is mostly menuing without animations. This is especially blatant in the very optional fighting sections of the game, where enemies have very simple silhouettes and pop in and out of existence.

Cutscenes with animation are very ugly. Kind of hard to tell what's actually going on in some cases, especially since they feature the primary conflict of the game very early on.

The good

You're going to need to finish quite a few playthroughs to get all the endings. My first time, my primary love interest turned into an eldrich horror that made my protagonist pass out and forget everything. Kind of an intense ending.

Lots of romance options for the MC, it's like Harvest Moon on fast forward.

Art can be very good when it wants to be, especially the ending, where judgy kid Rose tells you all about your failures.

Load times are very fast.

Lots of options for playthroughs.

It's... a game for people who want to play a game about raising a kid. It's not a game for everyone, and probably not a game that I'll revisit very often, but I played it and I don't necessarily regret it.",1682349127,1682349127,False,7,0,0.55505216121673584,0,True,False,False

The not as good: lots of progress breaking bugs. Of the ~2 hours on record for me so far, about 33% of that time has been spent replaying content after any number of errors force crash the game, break the UI so that menus can't be exited, and more.

The bottom line: there is a fun and charming game to be had here and with an introductory discount, it may be worthwhile. Be prepared to lose time, progress, and motivation to a number of technical issues beyond the player's control. Will update this review after more time/fixes have been applied.

EDIT: Update after a couple of days of waiting on bug fixes.

Also I do really appreciate that the game makes it really clear what you need to do to achieve certain endings, thats a problem I've had with other games. They also do a great job of making you feel like your choices matter. Plus mc is adorable 10000/10

There are a number of glitches that can anywhere between slightly annoying and soft-locking the game and since it's a small team the bug-fixing might take a bit. Translation is also pretty iffy but at least for me it never got in the way of understanding the story, most of it is words being translated differently in different spots, especially names (ex: Volcano year vs fire year or Rebressa vs Lebesa)

I personally think think the game is 100% worth it, but if you don't want to deal with the bugs/translation maybe wishlist it till some patches are done, or buy it while its on sale and let it sit in your library till one day you remember it exists",1682342305,1682342305,True,2,0,0.505813956260681152,0,True,False,False

Opening 
================================================================================================
My daughter was born on 23 April and named Jean. I must admit, this is truly a difficult start since early departure of my wife, but I must press on for the sake of our daughter, our dream. At her early age, we loved to went around town and tried everything we could do at that day. early morning activity was always go-to start for our plan. I knew, this wouldn’t lead to any further mastery in her future, nevertheless I wished she enjoyed everything that I could offer. 
As she growed up, she started to went around town and be a part of them. She truly one of the heart from the town, everyone is her friend. -heck, even i lost count, how many people has come to our house to see her (my guess is roughly 9, for romantic event). But it put ease on my mind since I got caught an unknown disease. At least, if it’s the will from the heaven to separate us on earth prematurely, she still had the town to rely on. But thanks to the heaven for he decided not to do so until the time.
My daughter wasn’t a champion but she was champion in my heart. She might not the best daughter in the world, but she’s the best for me and I hope the best for her. I’m proud of her, because she can be who she is and married to whom she loves.
Welp, actually, that’s my bad. I thought, it was better to had good term with his headmaster- Mr. Claude- so she wouldn’t have much trouble in school. Both of them took it too seriously, what a mess. At least, my advice, to cook first the ingredients, which come from her adventure, was a good idea. She becomes a good cooker and has her own restaurant.
And here I’m, on the first spring of this year without her, my wife reach home, which is truly a saving grace.
Also my transformation into a chicken is canceled, I don’t know why. I’m disappointed.

Review
================================================================================================
(Disclaimer) This’s my first steam review. It’s worth to take note that my gaming history mostly in fps genre and/or something relate to world war 2 but recently, I want to expend my horizon. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt. No, a lot of them, not just a grain.
Volcano Princess is a rising-“daughter” simulation with visual novel and rpg frame. The players are tasked to raise her daughter whatever they see suit for her. Your aim is her future career and fiancé (and yes, you can make your daughter marry to other daughter, I tried this to avoid “cucked” feeling but failing due to academic reason: pleasing the headmaster). How to do it? Raise those numbers, baby~. Each turn, the player has a number of action. It can be used to do activity and replenished in certain ways. To end turn, player “plan” study activity for the daughter.
There’s a lot of arts, ton of them, and there’re good but due to the variety accessories, I find it’s insufficient and bothering. But this flaw is ignorable.
The voice is limited to just reaction such as laughing, thinking, etc. There’s no text reading.
The music is okay at bringing the mood, but I ignored it most of the time.
The rising elements (or the gameplay) is okay. Most of the time, the players raise her daughter through town interaction and planning system. I find this system is boring, due to repetitiveness, since most daughter actions are dictated by player options directly (not through father as mediator) and counted in numbers. I prefer to say it as lack of surprise element because it’s sureness (the authority of player and the honesty of numbers). % RNG isn’t the surprise element I mean, but the turning events base on choice like “Disco Elysium” (unfair comparison, but that’s the best I have). 
The story is niche, classic fantasy and a little bit of plot. I’m not sure how the plot turns out since somehow, I managed to avoid by achieve true ending. The good part is the light-warm interaction between char’s family. Other interactions are sometimes ambiguous due to translation, but still readable by putting few logics. Too bad, I couldn’t focus the story much (mostly I skimmed) because I feel uncomfortable with the UI. It’s my problem since I have encounter many similar UI and I couldn’t do much about my concentration.
The game itself is a little bit buggy. I couldn’t open the letter from friends (or I stuck with letter in opened position) and few times my games force close by itself, I’m not sure why.
Final verdict, I with reluctant to pick unrecommended but due to major recommended review, I decide so. I couldn’t recommend this game to past-self because my gaming history. Nevertheless, it still a good experience although at certain point, I want to bash my head to my keyboard so badly. I highly recommend this game to people that love raising-simulation, romance, and/or “visual novel”. If you’re a casual, I recommend you to wait for a while because the bug problem and translation issue.

Can't read letters as there's no way to switch from the first letter in the stack or close the top window when you open them. Meaning you have to force quit the game. That's an entire feature of the game that not only doesn't work but literally breaks the game. Its also essentially auto save only. There is a save function, but when you load the game no matter where you saved you restart the entire day so you really can only save at the start of the day, where auto save saves your game already. To be fair the game tells you this when you save but if that was going to be the case the devs could have totally take the player save functionality out had the same result and fixed other bugs. If the player save feature is going to be there it should do something. Not sure if others had the issue, and at least this bug wasn't game breaking, but there is a stables race game bit to the game and it just doesn't function. You hover over the button to ""Participate"" and you can sit there and click all day but despite the button reacting visually to you hovering over and clicking it the button does nothing. Sometimes other clicks don't respond but if you wait a second and click again it suddenly works, and other times you click to read dialogue and it just skips two or three frames of dialogue or narrative and there's no way to go back so you just flat out miss it.
I feel like this could be a very good game especially for $10, but with all the bugs and some of them flat out game breaking along with sections/features of the game that just don't work at all this feels like a beta version or an early access game that you're paying for to do beta testing for free for the devs. Maybe there will be an update that fixes everything and I'll have to change this review, but until then I just can't recommend the game.",1682331944,1682331944,False,3,0,0.530695974826812744,0,True,False,False

Not nearly as much as My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist for a few reasons. There are several problems that you may or may not be able to overlook.

Most noticeably, the translations are CRUNCHY. It's not really a problem for most of the game, you can pretty easily get the gist of what was meant. Once you get in to later story stuff for the true ending it gets pretty difficult to understand, to the point that I'm wondering if there are some sequence breaks I found accidentally.

There are also two pretty severe and consistent game breaking bugs. First and foremost are the gift letters you receive. These will lock the game up every single time you try to open one. Fortunately they aren't really a necessary part of the game, they're mostly for flavor. Second is a save data corruption bug that can happen if you have cloud saves enabled. As of the version I'm playing (1.00.00 I think) the devs even have it in the announcements with instructions for how to turn off cloud saves. There are also a number of other bugs that are less consistent, e.g. I once had to force quit when I got stuck in the horse capturing event.

The game is similar to Long Live The Queen or My Life As A Teenage Exocolonist. 

You talk to people, give gifts, take classes, go on expeditions, farm, cook, work at a part time job, do alchemy, etc. You raise statistics through coursework, consuming certain farming outputs, consuming potions, buying outfits, or getting decorations for your house. Some combat specific stats can be raised through going on expeditions. Talking to characters you see on screen also grants a ""perception"" statistic / currency that is used when responding to letters you see if you have admirers, which can be gained from fame you get from attending balls or working as an actress, or from part time jobes at the bath with more sketchy jobs like card dealer for the mafia granting more admirers. The perception currency you get from talking to each character makes it worth while to talk to everyone and makes it so there are no useless character interactions in the game.

At the end of a playthrough, the person your daughter has the closest relationship with is the trigger for who your daughter marries as an adult. Your daughter may romance female characters if you to. Relationships with characters can be raised by chatting with them, giving them gifts, consulting them which also raises your statistics, challenging them to debates or duels, and taking them on dates. Dates so far seem completely platonic with some romantic undertones as nothing more lewd than handholding or hugging is shown (at least that I have seen in my 2 playthroughs so far).

As you play the game you will inevitably have accomplishments which are worth points at game end to make life the next time around easier. You can boost statistics, base relationship values with folks, boost fame, and get items for the next playthrough.

Like some other games in the genre, some of the ""best"" or possibly ""true"" endings are much easier to accomplish in your second playthrough with boosted statistics. There is some explanation on why the starting a new life narratively makes sense, but giving the specifics of why new game + is a thing in this setting would spoil the story. 

Current state, there are some typos, not enough to break the game, as the developer does not speak English natively. There are some bugs, that I ran into which caused me to need to restart the game. The developer has a discord and is actively working on fixing the reported bugs. 

I felt pretty good playing this game, I did not feel stressed out like I did in trying to get a good ending in Long Live the Queen. There are many endings you can get, and it is not the end of the world to get an average ending. Every playthrough can help you get achievements to boost your character in new game +. 

Oh, and the art is nice for the game. The seasonal changes in every single area of the game are nice.

My game crashed after I attempted to capture a wild horse. Reloading fixed the issue.

I attempted to open an letter and my game froze again - this time reloading did not fix the issue. I know you can ignore the letters but it's my first play through - I want to see what my buddies have to say. I'm not temporarily switching the game language to Chinese as a work around. I'm not going to change my game to roll back the most recent patch. I'm going to wait until the bug is fixed.

***

The music is pleasant, the characters are engaging, and the game play is enjoyable. This game is like Long Live the Queen and Princess Maker on steroids in the best possible way. 

Tell me you've never played a Princess Maker game without telling me you've never played a Princess Maker game? 
By complaining about the translation. 
Is it wonky? Sure. 
Is it unplayable because of it? Nope.

As this is my first play through I'm not entirely certain what I'm supposed to be focusing on so my daughter has performed in plays and worked at the baths. She's made lots of friends and I love the scenes with them spending time together.

The dialogue between the father and daughter is heartwarming. This game makes you want to raise a daughter well so that she will succeed. So far I haven't had any instances with her running away from home like Olive in PM2, but I also haven't let her darkness get terribly high. Olive in PM2 annoyed me with her running away from home. If Rose ran away in Volcano Princess I'd curl into a ball and cry on the floor.

Relationships: Your daughter can't date her father but she CAN date girls. We love to see it. She can also have relationships with people a bit older than her - and I do not like that. Just a personal thing, grandpa types shouldn't be sending my kid letters.

Great Princess Maker-esque (or Long Live the Queen) game despite some bugs and iffy english texts. 8/10

The good: There is a lot of things you can do, and choices to make that will give varying results without being too punishing. Aside from story related choices most mistakes can be fixed as long as you're not going for a perfect run.
A lot of short mini-games to keep it interesting without it being a chore, since obviously you'll be doing them more than once if you're aiming for a specific stat.
Although I've only reached one ending as of this review, the story and ending was nothing too far from what I would've expected from the choices I made.
The visuals are good, cute, and fitting.

The bad: At the time of the review, mainly the bugs and iffy english translations.
I ran into a few bugs but nothing terribly unavoidable or detrimental to the progression, but there were times where I needed to restart the game. At least the auto save is there in case you forget to manually save.
The text is mostly broken or have grammatical/spelling errors, but most are comprehensible to a point. This may bother some and break the immersion. Nothing was broken to the point of making a wrong choice during my first playthrough.

Some minor QoL functions are missing, such as text skipping but honestly since most texts are short it's not the end of the world.
Both manual and auto saves start at the beginning of the day, so there is no way to save right before choices. But again, the texts aren't long so it's not that difficult to go back to the same spot from the start of the day.",1682257910,1682257910,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

优点：
1，美丽的动态2D背景、细致的CG作画、悠扬的场景BGM，为整个作品创造了特殊的独特氛围感；
2，游戏中设计了相当多数量的子系统，每一个子系统之下又能对应多种不同的反馈机制，无论是人际/探索/养成，皆有独到之处，与其它养成类游戏能拉开足够远的区分度；
3，世界观的设计能明显地看出制作组所花费的心力，游戏的仪轨涉及渗透到了方方面面，完全没有让人出戏的突兀感；
4，程序设计非常稳定，全程没有出现过一次崩溃、跳出、Bug事件。

缺点：
1，女儿在童年时期的时间过短，印象里只有短短数回合，女儿就会进入到青春期，这让玩家的心流节奏有些跟不上；
2，某一些子系统的数值平衡仍然需要进一步打磨，无论是探索战斗，还是人际关系，后期基本上都存在通用解法，多周目游玩不免缺乏足够的随机意外和惊喜；
3，大反派的人物弧光过于突兀，没有成功地说明反派为何之所以是反派，沦为一个脸谱化的存在，游戏最终幕的呈现节奏也过于赶工了。",1682250478,1682250478,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was expecting it to be some dumb poorly translated visual novel, and while it's still poorly translated (which only really makes it funnier, on top of a very funny game), what's mind blowing is HOW MUCH CONTENT THERE IS and also HOW GOOD IT ALL IS. I spent 11 hours on my first run, and noticed there are 58 ENDINGS, EVERY CHARACTER IS ROMANCEABLE (except 2, sorry dilf lovers) and there's a HADES-LIKE MIRROR OF DARKNESS SYSTEM. THIS GAME IS A ROGUELIKE VISUAL NOVEL????
I'm also blown away by how much heart it has. It really nails feeling both like raising a daughter and growing up yourself, as the game is split between playing as the father and as the daughter. The characters are ALL incredible, there isn't a single character I even thought was meh. The only problem I have with the story/characters is that there is SO MUCH that I can't possibly fit it all in one playthrough. Luckily, as I mentioned before, the new game plus allows you to start with a wide array of benefits like in Hades, which honestly is a very similar game.
As far as I can tell, there are 3 main ""routes"" you can take, which is basically strength, intelligience, or charisma. I went charisma on my first run, which meant I made a killing doing plays or working at the bathhouse, and can't wait to try the other two routes!
The combat is VERY good, which I was not expecting AT ALL. Like I said before, I did the charisma route, which meant my strength was lacking, but it was still really fun finding a combination of weapons and abilities that could let me triumph (burn is broken btw, it essentially gives you an extra attack worth of damage each turn, and it only accumulates)

More to do overall, I love the interactions and the endings, and you as the father have a larger part in the story.

Lots of endings (like PM2) with no set path to go through the game. Play as you want, help her make decisions and you're good to go.

Lots of unique characters to befriend. **Almost** everyone named in the game can be befriended.

Manual combat for explorations does get kinda lenghty, and I do wish there was an auto-battle option. Probably my least favorite thing in the game.

I currently have no intention to play again because the game left me feeling wholly satisfied with how things wrapped up, and I personally believe that to be a big plus. Totally worth the $10.

Translation is rough in some spots but not bad enough to affect my enjoyment, and the only bug I encountered was the (often reported) issue where sometimes when you click on a letter the game softlocks. Luckily exiting the game, reloading the autosave at the start of the day, and simply ignoring the letters let me keep playing, but still an inconvenience that needs to be fixed.

All in all, lovely experience. It's very pretty and the different ways you can choose to progress kept things feeling fairly interesting. There's a lot of stuff and a lot of alternate endings, so if you're the kind of person who wants to grind those out you'll have a good time.

You have to truly ponder what decisions you have made along the way that brought you to the place of your final reckoning.

It is still unclear, even to me, why I purchased Volcano Princess.
There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?
When I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.

If it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.
Yet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.

There is something broken within me, something that desires sensation beyond my reach, something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true Princess, it is a merely an illusion.
In my pursuit to find meaning in this long life, I sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer.

It's Princess Maker 2 but bigger, better, with more activites, the world feels massive and it seems you have a degree of freedom that all ""rise simulators"" should aim for.

I remember when I played PM2 that you were kind of ""forced"" into warrior builds in order to go to the dungeon and it made seeking arts, literature paths boring and empty. This my friends is completely fixed in Volcano Princess.

Seems you can even romance girls and you are not locked into marrying your daugther to male (haven't reached the end game yet of course but the option seems to be there and the girls don't shy away of being ""flirtious"" with your daugther)

Also, the game has a loit of mini games, you are into dice gambling you have it, you are more into rhetorical debates you got it too, ""mini"" farming sim... it's there, cooking game... you got it, random ""loot"" grind... yup you guessed it it's there too.

9/10 If you ever played Princess Maker series or Romanesque Witch or any other ""rising sim"" it's a MUST BUY.
