S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl takes a very long time to get going. For the first 6 or 7 hours I was using INCREDIBLY inacurate guns, where only 1 out of 10 shots actually hit where I aimed (not even kidding). This quickly gets really frustrating. I know that this is done to make the game more realistic and immersive, but in reality it only forces me to play the game in the most unrealistic maner possible, by charging large groups of enemies with a double barreled shotgun, hoping to not get killed in the process, this way you will at least hit your shots in point-blank range.

However, the game gets much better once you start aquiring better guns with higher accuracy and better armors that almost works as a metroidvania style progression system that now let's you explore a few new areas that previously had a too high radiation level etc.

There is certainly a lot of freedom given to the player in this game in how you want to aproach the games many different obstacles. Kitchen-sink design and Immersive-sim elements, with a more or less open-world for you to explore make this game very different from the much more linear Metro series for instance. 
Despite the large freedom the game gives you there are a lot of things that are just a lot less viable than others. Stealth for instance is basicly useless or at least incredibly difficult to pull off in a way that actually works.

On master difficulty i had plenty of healing items and ammo through the entire game and i wish it was a bit harder to come by, but the guns a bit more accuarate. Money also seemed completely useless, and by the end of the game i didn't have to really buy a single thing from any of the traders in the game.

The more i played of Shadow of Chernobyl the more i liked it tho, despite the games many glaring flaws. This is certainly one of those games where mods can give you a much better experience than the base game (The modding scene is also pretty crazy for the Stalker series)

As a kind of guy who is not really into mods and tries to enjoy games as they are, this really hit me hard!
kept telling myself this may just make the game a bit more challenging and that's good, I would enjoy a little bit of challenge! but it wasn't just a challenge, it was downright broken! setting crashes and minor AND MAJOR performance and graphical issues aside, the thing that drove me nuts was the broken hit box system, it was like the guy was in the point-blank range and I shot him three times in the face but he keep comin' as if nothing happened because no hits were registered! 
so make sure to install at least one essential mod to not have your whole experience of the game ruined!
Also I'm not sure the modding would fix these things that i'm about to mention but let's just say it! (because i only had one mod installed myself)  
first) since most gun fights happen in open spaces this wouldn't occur very often but sometimes enemies can shoot through walls! I noticed it in the last mission [spoiler] since it took place in Chernobyl NPP, it's an enclosed area, most sections are separated with walls [/spoiler] and it kept on happening! and man, you have no idea how disappointing it was! it probably had happened before but I didn't notice it because there was some distance between me and the enemies, unlike the mentioned level!
second) you can't even save scum in most areas! especially in the last mission (yeah just like the other bug that I mentioned earlier I noticed it in this very level because things get out of hand pretty easily! I'm not that big of a scum!) because when you reload them enemies re-spawn and there's a high chance that they do it right next to you 0_0

Positive Aspects:

Atmosphere and Immersion: One of the most consistent praises for the game is its immersive atmosphere. The desolate and eerie landscape of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, combined with dynamic weather and day-night cycles, contributes to a hauntingly realistic environment.

Open-World Exploration: Critics and players appreciated the freedom to explore the open-world setting known as ""The Zone."" The nonlinear structure and a sense of unpredictability in encounters with mutants and anomalies added to the overall immersion.

Faction System: The inclusion of different factions within the Zone, each with its own agenda and territories, added depth to the narrative and gameplay. Players could choose to align with a faction, affecting the story and missions available to them.

Realistic Survival Elements: The game's attention to survival aspects, such as managing resources, dealing with radiation, and staying vigilant against mutants and anomalies, added a layer of realism and challenge.

Multiple Endings: The multiple endings based on player choices were well-received, encouraging replayability as players could experience different outcomes by making different decisions throughout the game.

Criticisms:

Technical Issues: Some critics pointed out technical issues, including occasional bugs, glitches, and performance issues. However, many of these were addressed through patches and community-made mods.

Learning Curve: Some players found the game's learning curve to be steep, especially for those unfamiliar with the survival-shooter genre. The lack of handholding and the complex inventory system could be initially overwhelming for some.

Graphical Presentation: While praised for its atmospheric design, the game's graphics were considered somewhat dated even at the time of its release. However, the modding community has since provided graphical enhancements.

Despite these criticisms, ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl"" has stood the test of time and gained a dedicated fanbase. Its impact on the gaming industry is evident in the continued interest, modding community support, and the subsequent success of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.

Excellent story, holds up very strongly even to this day. Gameplay is very fun once you get used to it; the most balanced difficulty is also the hardest, so the game revolves heavily around headshotting enemies with good positioning. You'd think that would become a tedious or annoying system, but it just adds to the satisfaction. Enemies aren't bullet spongey but neither are you; even with the strongest artifacts I found myself dying several times in the more intense firefights.

It's absolutely absurd how drawn into the game you get. It's wildly immersive despite its dated appearance. I'll admit, it was a little tough to get used to it all in the beginning, and the keybinds were a little odd, so there was a good amount of configuring I had to do. But it was beyond worth it, because STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl might genuinely be one of my favorite gaming experiences (I swear it's not the recency bias talking).

Despite having the key story and lore elements foolishly spoiled to me in a lore video (I initially thought I wasn't going to play the games and just wait for STALKER 2, but I now realize that was my biggest mistake!) the game thoroughly surprised me time and time again, with its masterful environment and ambiance. 

I also appreciate that each faction has its own unique take on the zone, and isn't some bizarre, ridiculous binary between some wild hedonist sex cult and a megafascist chudtopia.

PS: don't let the time played fool you; I've played the entire game and done every side quest using a bugfix mod because my computer was bugging out a lot playing it otherwise.

From the moment you step into the worn boots of the protagonist, the game envelopes you in a sense of isolation, danger, and intrigue that is rarely matched in the gaming world.

The atmospheric storytelling is where S.T.A.L.K.E.R. truly shines. The desolate landscapes, dilapidated structures, and the ever-present threat of anomalies and mutated creatures create an environment that is as captivating as it is foreboding. The nonlinear narrative allows for a deeply personal experience, with player choices influencing the outcome of the story, adding layers of replayability.

The attention to detail in recreating the Zone is remarkable, capturing the eerie beauty and danger of the real-life Chernobyl region. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather contribute to the overall sense of realism, enhancing the immersion and making every moment feel tense and unpredictable.

The survival elements, including resource management and the constant need for caution, add depth to the gameplay. The gunplay is satisfyingly realistic, and the scarcity of resources forces players to make strategic decisions, creating a tense and immersive atmosphere throughout.

The A.I.-driven characters and factions within the Zone add a layer of complexity to the gameplay. The interactions with other stalkers, mercenaries, and hostile factions create a living, breathing world where alliances and betrayals are part of the harsh reality.

While the game has a few rough edges, they become part of the charm, showcasing the dedication of the developers to deliver an authentic and immersive experience. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is more than just a game; it's an atmospheric journey into a post-apocalyptic world that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1640835727,1708178233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After 30 minutes found out a singular file was set to hidden and the game couldn't launch because of it. This one ill take the blame for but I don't recall ever hiding any files. Next, I finally get it to open and I instantly shut it down and installed a no head bobbing mod because it was so god damn nauseating. Next, every single god damn time i launched the game, it never remembered my settings, so after getting sick of redoing the settings after the 7th time, I did some research and found out I needed to code the game my fucking self and add a line in fsgame.ltx that make it save the settings. Next, the guns are incredible inaccurate, truthfully i was using the first pistol, but after getting an smg I kid you not I would spray an enemy no farther than 3 feet from me in the chest and only 1 out of 20 would hit him. It is quite literally useless to shoot anywhere but the head as it seems the developers only made the hitbox for the head. Found it frustrating that the combat is suppose to be realistic, yet the bullet spray is anything but realistic. The fact that there are guides in the community that help you fix the combat speaks for itself. All this work just for the game to be extremely boring and no incentive to continue playing. Maybe I just didn't play long enough but the hook wasn't even there for it even be able to set in for me. Had no motive to speak with npc's as they were extremely boring and consisted of fetch/errand tasks. Honestly I feel like i could've been a fan of the game but it is so old and just a fucking chore to even get it to run that I lost all desire to play it.

Your goal is to figure out the secret of the wasteland, and maybe figure out who you are along the way.

It’s kind of like Fallout, but more atmospheric, and a bit like Half-Life, however nowhere near as refined, and then mashed together in a sort of half-and-half chimera. It’s not bad, not excellent, and very unique. The shooting gameplay can be a little frustrating as it feels like most of the weapons in your hands have a wide spread while the enemies can headshot you from 30 feet away, and it isn’t uncommon to fail a quest because a guy you need gets eliminated from someone that you can’t even see.

It’s overly ambitious in the way that some 2000’s games are, and considering how this was once vaporware, it’s not only neat that it actually made it to release, it’s genuinely pretty cool how atmospheric and enjoyable the whole experience is. It’s definitely a little broken and sometimes frustratingly buggy. One good example of this that I experienced involved a mid-game “help us defend this barrier” mission where, upon completion, the guy I needed to talk to in order to turn the quest in decided to go on a full sprint across the map directly into a minefield in front of another faction’s main base. Neat.

Exploring the zone is a ton of fun though, but this game definitely isn’t for everyone. You have to be ready to accept a somewhat broken experience that feels overly strange at times.

I would recommend adding in the Zone Reclamation Project mod, which basically acts as a bug fix and adds the ability for you to tweak certain things if you feel the need to, which, with a game this old and strange, you might be inclined to make a few changes like adjusting how inaccurate weapons can be or maybe increasing the carry weight a bit, and if you get tired of going back and forth across some areas, the fast travel feature is nice to have.

Only real thing that bothered me in the whole run is the Weight system, ammo was just too heavy all the time or maybe I just looted too many heals? regardless I felt heavy at all times, always hovering around 47-50kg at all times dropping things just to pick things up constantly, maybe with more exploration I can upgrade inventory so I cant complain too much but that really was driving me crazy, dropping guns to pick up a gun with a compatible ammo, then dropping half my ammo because this new guns too heavy.

I really liked the atmosphere people were right its pretty immersive with the sound effects, unfortunately the game is old and doesnt support anything over stereo so surround sound was out of the question, also the ui scaled pretty bad on my 80inch 4K TV, all text was microscopic, but atleast it was crisp.

overall good game, with excellent history, feel bad for the people near Chernobyl, still cant believe this really happened, looking forward to the new game more now, glad I played this.

(side note: having bolts in your hand as your unarmed default is a strange choice, made me feel like I was playing TF2 Engineer for whatever reason, idk.)",1707635994,1707635994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of radiation seems to cause my PC to shut down after only mere minutes of playing. Too risky. 

On a real note: This game seems to have some weird thing about it, and only this one alone. Where it overheats your PC, and causes it to shut down to save itself at random points. I have a good rig. Can play any modern game. Tried fixing it, but to no avail. I can't recommend it since I'm too worried to even play it as it may give my PC a stroke. 

Buyer beware.

such an interesting story, the mysteries of the dangerous but beautiful zone, with the plot-twists of the protagonist identity, mixed with the emotional soundtracks, like ""Dirge for the planet"", makes this game the best FPS Singleplayer experience, beating Half-Life 2 and others from the same category in the 2000's tremendously, can't wait to play the sequel!",1706753720,1706754001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This can be helped slightly by turning the difficulty up to a harder setting so your shots do more damage but in turn that means enemies gunfire does more damage to you too. It can be unforgiving even on easier settings but the sense of reward when you survive a large ambush is very high.

The story is a bit odd and hardly compelling, but it's enough to keep you interested. With it's real life disaster backstory mixed with a novel it's a nice blend between fact and fiction. All around a fun and immersive horror/shooter.

I would definitely recommend playing the Vanilla version first, or you could go to MODDB and download mods to make the game look prettier and add newer weapons, which is what i do a lot of the time nowadays.

- Bullets don't go where you aim, even when ADS and fully crouched. Idk who made this design choice but they should be fired. It doesn't make the gunplay 'realistic', it makes it tedious and boring.
- Walk speed is really slow and sprint doesn't recharge unless you are standing still. Another strange decision considering the world is decently big. This makes getting from point A to point B is a slog.
- Exploration isn't rewarding. You'll find ammo, generic weapons, or meds. Every enemy carries this stuff and your carry space is very limited so it's a good chance you already have plenty.
- Game is buggy.
- Story is not very interesting. At least not in the 6 hours I played, which is likely as far as you'll get before everything aforementioned wears you down.

If I'm looking for something positive to say about this game, it does atmosphere well. There were a few sections that were eerie to traverse. If that's something you're really into, I'm sure there's better games for you to check out.

Rest in peace Volodymyr Yezhov, you will live on in our games, Stalker!

Ukrainian Developer of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Video Game Killed Near Bakhmut. Volodymyr Yezhov was killed defending the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donetsk region on December 22. He was one of the developers behind the successful video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, which was released in 2008. One of the game's characters, Loki, was based on Yezhov's face.

Volodymyr Yezhov was born on August 1, 1984 in Lubny, Poltava Oblast. He graduated from KPI with a degree in electronics engineering. He was also one of the most famous Ukrainian e-sportsmen — played StarCraft under the nickname Fresh. In 2003, he joined the GSC Game World company, which was the developer of such cult games as Cossacks and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

He was also involved in the creation of several RTS games: Alexander (2004), Cossacks 2 (2005) and Heroes of Annihilated Empires (2006) and World of Battles: Morningstar, Call of Cthulhu, and Sherlock Holmes: Devil’s Daughter.

Viacheslav Yezhov, brother of Volodymyr, on Facebook:
""Today, my brother, a father of two, a faithful friend with a sincere heart, died defending Ukraine. He used to say that a happy future for our children is being forged through the fight that the Ukrainian people are currently waging. I hope you have arrived at a better world, brother,"" Viacheslav Yezhov posted.

The fact that he is the face leader of the Freedom faction in game makes this hurt even more, in the end he really died fighting for the freedom of his country.

The atmosphere is on point, the story is compelling, the pacing is good, & it's just challenging enough to push you around a bit & force you to be thoughtful without being overly frustrating.  

I've seen lots of complaints about the vanilla experience & urges to play with mods, but I can say that the overall unmodded vanilla experience was really good for me.  I didn't experience anything game breaking.  

Some bugs were annoying, like having a period of time where all the hidden stashes I was opening were coming up empty & the map markers wouldn't clear off the map without me taking items out of them.  😂

One thing that did bother me a bit was the sequence-breaking that can happen if you don't take the intended path in certain missions.  Some of the sequence triggers were not very well thought out imo.  

Regarding the shooting mechanics in this game,  RNG is not the problem & you don't need mods to experience fair play.  This isn't doom & it wasn't meant to be, lol.  If you want to hit your shots you need to use weapons from the appropriate distance, crouch more often, & ADS.  Do yourself a favor & disable the crosshair because point shooting in this game is inconsistent & inaccurate on purpose.  Always ADS if you want to hit your shots, & aim for the head if running out of ammo isn't your thing 😂.  Crouching tightens up your accuracy and crouching lower tightens it even more.

I played through from the beginning. blind on master difficulty and re-played the final section on novice.  The only differences I noticed were in the AI behavior & damage taken by the player.  Headshots were still just as effective as Master, but the AI was less agressive, slower to shoot, had worse aim, did less damage & caused less bleeding.  

For those who care,  the best way I found to consistently save Yuri is to sneak around the right side of the trucks, run up & backstab the closest bandit before switching to guns.  It matters to me,  OK!?  😂

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

- Game is harsh and wants to punish you really bad, that's part of the old school survival horror game athmosphere. Play this game only if you can deal with that and the frustration that comes with it.
- Make a lot of saves, and incremental saves (don't always overwrite), otherwise you'll most likely regret it towards the end.
- Don't bother too much accumulating stuff, even if it's to sell it, it's not worth it. All the useful equipment you need can be found or obtained for free, you only need to buy ammunition and the rewards from the quests are enough to finance it. Otherwise you might have too much money on you and the game might punish you for it.
- Don't skip the Guide or get trolled.

Mixed feelings about this game. Back in 2007 it must have been great but it hasn't aged very well.
Graphics are not great but it's ok, there are glitches but it's okay, you get used to it. Sounds are kinda cheap, that is harder to get used to though.
However the gameplay and game design are often frustrating or disapointing in ways you wouldn't accept for modern games.

There is little characters development, story is only scratching at the surface despite the massive lore potential.
It all relies on the survival & horror gameplay, which is well developed and perhaps a little ""too realistic"" for its own good.
At time it felt like a dangerous hiking simulator, main concern being the management of the content of your backpack and the huge distances you have to cover. At first you want to explore and accumulate stuff you find, but eventually you have to face the reality that your weapon, suit and ammunition take most of your load capacity.
Guns are massively innacurate at range and you rarely can get too close without dying quicjly, so you waste a lot of ammo that you can't really stock up too much in advance, so you also have to worry constantly about finding the balance about saving and refilling your ammo.

Gun fights are frustrating all game long. At first you get shit guns but lots of ammo, so you spend lot of time killing anything. Then you get a decent rifle and kills more efficiently but you struggle to maintain a sufficient stock of ammo. And to finish, you get better guns but face so many brutal enemies that you might get plenty ammo but you need to heal a lot all while reloading your save over and over because you keep dying. There is a sense of progression in all that, so it makes sense, but at the cost of a lot of frustration.

But the worst of it all has got to be the endings. I don't know if it's genius or an insult but I've rarely been so frustrated by a game ending. Not spoiling anything but basically if you intuitively progress through the game, you'll eventually reach the end only to realize you've failed it, game stops and laughts at your face.
To reach a real ending, you need to spend a lot more time going back to several early places you've visited to complete an optional questline which only looked like a side quest, especially since it is listed in the middle of several irrelevant side quests. Had I not checked the internet for alternate endings I would not have known that a troll ending wasn't all of it.",1705096554,1705096554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Second, even though a lot of people say to play to play Pripyat and Clear Sky before this, I ask you still play this game before the others. It's a really good introductory to the simple elements that the other games will begin to expand upon (examples being artifacts, factions, guns etc).

Setting:
     The game is a little interesting, as it has both sci-fi and alternate history in its lore. The story revolves around the 10 km radioactive exclusion zone (which is referred to as ‘The Zone’ ingame) that was set up after the 1986 disaster at the CNPP. The story has it that soviet scientists began experiments within the Zone far from the public eye. As experiments continued, even after 1991, more and more unusual events occur within the Zone however the Ukrainian government does not interfere because of anticipation of international backlash for potentially harming scientists. Anomalies continue to mount until the eventual ‘Second Disaster’ near the CNPP. Between March 4th and June 12th of 2006 began a series of strange, unnatural disasters. An unbearable light illuminated the sky and the clouds evaporated all the while a 6.9 earthquake shook the land. Something only described as an “energy disturbance” which is later named an “emission” began making waves over the zone, immediately killing all personnel hit by it. As the disasters subsided, it certainly left its mark. Strange and physics defying anomalies perspirated the area within the exclusion zone, puzzling the scientific community and preventing the military personnel from getting to the CNPP. These anomalies have formed strange artifacts that have positive and negative effects on the human body, and (a few) were even able to be replicated by scientists. Some soldiers within the zone defected, starting their own faction. The members of the new faction (known as Duty) are arguably the first ‘S.T.A.L.K.E.R’s. S.T.A.L.K.R is an abbreviation for Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers and Robbers. This name, is appropriately applied to the now growing population of the Zone. In the eyes of many, the Zone is the last frontier. Hundreds from all around sneak into the zone to prospect for artifacts, battle mutants or simply enjoy a free life in the anarchy. 

Premise:
     S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a post-apocalyptic, survival horror, open world, atmospheric shooter which takes place in the radioactive exclusion zone of Chernobyl, which, after the (obviously fictional) events of 2006, is now simply known as ‘The Zone’. You assume the role of a S.T.A.L.K.E.R who has lost his memory, knowing only that he must kill ‘The Strelok’, whoever that is. In his journey to accomplish this mission, the player will slowly but surely expand his arsenal, make allies (and enemies) and reveal the secrets of the zone.
Aesthetics: - 10/10
     This is basically the one thing people hold the highest in the franchise, so I think it's appropriate to get this over with first. The atmosphere is fantastic, think of the eerie moments from Fallout 3 and New-Vegas but without the breaks. The game bathes the player in second-to-none ambiance and even long time players are often put on edge. Shadow of Chernobyl is the smartest with their music, each area has a single track that's hard to discern from actual music and just ambiance which (IMO) is how it should be. The only proper songs are in the menu and guitars that stalkers will play in game. Every once in a while when you're figuring out your inventory or trying to catch a breath you'll break out for a moment and take a moment to try and figure what direction a certain sound is coming from. I've heard from 'Slavic' players that the environment perfectly replicates the landscape and feeling of Eastern Europe, and gives them a sense of deja vu or nostalgia because of how accurate it is.  Ultimately, it does the job *very* well. It helps make game feel alive and sets the tone for the player appropriately.
     I really do not care about graphics as long as visuals are accurately represented (especially since I have a potato pc, so lower graphics are the norm for me). There is an insane amount of mods for graphics which make the game look amazing, so if you’re worried about that then the modding community is there for you.
     Besides that mods and *my* subjective opinion on graphics, the game actually holds up in some areas. First, the environmental textures are pretty good, at least if you aren’t looking at it too hard. Not only that but the lighting is absolutely incredible, and when used correctly, helps conceal the age of the game. What doesn’t hold up are the character models, (some of the) gun textures and animations. The character’s limbs look kind of goofy and the ragdolls are pretty stiff but are serviceable. A lot of the reload animations are choppy and some of the guns, specifically the ones that are supposed to look shiny look really crappy texture wise however I think the base models are fine and all of these are standard qualities for graphics from the time.
     The game has very few of what we’d call cut-scenes, but rather it has some cinematics that play. (IMO), cinematics will always be friggin amazing. I’ve always enjoyed old game cinematics from the late 2000s to early 2010s because they seem less “realistic” in quality and more.. artistic? They were trying their best to look real while using only digital tools at the time but it looks like its own artstyle and looks a bit dream like. The problem with cinematics however is they take a while to load and they don’t really fit the games graphics or art style which gives the players a bit of whiplash. But I think the devs understood this, and intended for the cinematics to be dreamlike in the first place. I won’t spoil anything, but some of the first couple cut scenes in the game actually work well.

Gameplay and Mechanics: - 9/10

     In gameplay, I think S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a jack-of-all-trades here. When I say jack-of-all-trades I don’t mean that it’s not good at any elements, but rather it’s a bit shallow on each but just because its shallow on certain areas doesn’t mean it’s bad at them.

Survival: -8/10
     Nowadays when people say ‘survival’ in a videogame setting what comes to mind is foraging which is more like gathering and building bases but its not quite like that. Rather than gathering it’s going to be more like scavenging for scraps. In early game you will will be picking up everything you see, every bullet will count. You’re going to be so down bad for ammunition (which is quite scarce) that you will be picking up every single gun and manually unload them (You can unload guns which I’m sure was mind blowing for 2007) just for that extra boost which some may find meticulous, but I find it immersive. Next to scavenging for ammo, you’ll be scavenging for guns too. Every weapon (except for the knife) has a durability bar. And as the durability meter gets lower and lower, the overall performance of the weapon is reduced. This means you’ll also be swapping out your old guns for newer ones to make sure you are performing at your best. This rarely affects the gameplay in a big way, but it contributes to the feeling that you are a scavenger who’s barely scraping by with the bare minimum.

      Though not too advanced, there’s a medical item system. There are three main items, food, bandages and med kits and while in the game, you want to make sure to use all of these correctly or else you’ll be wasteful. Food is easy to find, and replenishes a little bit of health upon being used, however it doesn’t do a whole lot and cannot stop bleeding. Bandages on the other hand, can stop bleeding however they aren’t that great in numbers and are not practical for health replenishment. Medkits, do a lot for health replenishment, but",1704665000,1704665000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This series will likely see an influx of players because of the hype around Stalker 2 and the new gamma mod, which is what drew me in. I just want to put it out there that even with mods, this is a very annoying game. It's a very ""fuck you"" game because of how quick you can die and how sneaky enemies can be.

The ending(s) are a joke and the story is... there? Metro has way better world building, lore and story if you're looking for that.

I guess what makes this game worth recommending is even though the game's attitude and design is very much ""fuck you"" the game gets a lot better when you learn to say ""fuck you too"" and come out on top.

Stalker SoC is one the greatest ""Open World"", what set's Stalker apart from other so called living and breathing game worlds is the over tone of cosmic horror, the game was inspired by a book named roadside picnic. Stalker unlike let's say Ubisoft, or basically any modern OPEN WORLD GAME. it feel's alive, the a-life systems allows for the AI to live, breath, roam, scavenge, fight, trade(they can on their own i think). The human AI all have some unique dialogue, why their here, what they want, how they feel, what they fear. Sometimes the humans AI when shot will sometimes down and lie on the floor dying an you and your comrade to chose what to do with them. the monsters will bite the meat off of dead bodies to survive, they try leave and retreat when they their all alone. the missions are well done, and take you all over the zone. Anomalies which are the most dangerous things in the zone,they can kill you and cannot be killed, and they activate when you step near thus you have to focus where you walk, anomalies are based on location as well. And the greatest thing about all of this is none of this is scripted.

i went to guide to collect info for the cannon ending. i went to fight to the the brain scorcher to turn it off the first outpost was easy i was using a gp37 and a spas shotgun. is used whatever sniper rifles from defeated enemies to kill rocket man from monolith. on the hill up to in the brain scorcher itself had monolith and i was slowly running out of supply. the monolith swarmed me and i slowly crept through the surface like a rat getting whatever i could have gotten from dead bodies. i wen to through the brain scorcher using whatever i could. then i turned it off and made it to the city. The city was meat grinder i crawled with barely and ammo couple of guns and slug shots swapping weapons every gunfight due to lack of ammo.  rooftops swarmed with rocket grenadiers, snipers, and Gauss gunners. I found the stash from Pripyat of fang. After i made to the outskirts of the Power plant. I ran like hell to get in the the Reactor as their were Attack helicopters and btr's. In the inside the reactor i fought through hordes of monolith, and i picked up a Gauss gun and a groza and fought through the reactor to find the secret door and the wish granter. once i  found the secret door and the exoskeleton suit. And i fought through the last of the monolith's elite troops that used spas shotgun's and 9x39 rifles and made it to the room of the C-conscientious and fought it. then i decided to defeat the last of the monolith. with my Exo Suit and with what i had left fought throught to outside of the power plant then at the end destroyed the C-conscientious.",1701653598,1704323038,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I heard a lot of hype about STALKER and I'm sure you have too given the massive cult following of the game. When I first got it, I expected something similar to Fallout, but more hardcore. What I got was a good game with a few unexpected twists. Here is an overview of some of the things you need to know before you buy.

[h2] The Setting [/h2]

STALKER takes place within The Zone, a post-double-disaster Chernobyl. The landscape is barren, inhospitable, and generally depressing. There is little to look at save for some trees, roads, destroyed buildings, and rubble. The world is somewhat sparse and [b] all travel is done on foot, there is no fast travel in this game. [/b]

The landscape is populated entirely by men and monsters. There aren't any misc items such that you would find in a game like Skyrim or Fallout. There are no containers to open, mainly there are just boxes to smash to get some ammo drops or a medkit. There are a total of 3 or so food items (so far as I can tell). So, don't expect a ton of loot to find.

Also, and this is important, [b] the map is NOT open world, it's a vast landscape that is divided into sections. When you travel from section to section, you have to wait through a loading screen. [/b]

The map is dotted by ""anomalies."" these are essentially pockets of areas that you don't want to be in. Some crush you instantly, some zap you with electricity, some are made of acid, some explode. You can see these all over the world as you walk down the road. These anomalies cause ""artifacts"" to spawn, which are essentially shiny rocks that give you stat boosts and that you can sell for a good chunk of change. They give you effects like +3 bulletproofing and -5 radiation, etc.

Generally, there isn't a whole lot to explore or look at in this game world. However, where the game shines is the atmosphere. It's depressing and quite frightening at times. The sound design is exceptional, very immersive and captivating. You will be unnerved at times, I guarantee it.

[h2] The Missions [/h2]

Now, we have to talk about the missions. I'm still in the process of working through the main story, but generally missions are given via dialogue with NPCs. These are provided in the style of Morrowind, wherein some dialogue is voice acted, but most is simply reading a text box. 

The vast majority of missions seem to be fetch or kill quests. Go here, kill this guy, get this document, etc. There isn't a whole lot of variety or creativity there.

[h2] The Gunplay [/h2]

Another important thing to point out is the gunplay. The battles in this game can be lengthy due to most enemies being bullet sponges. I mean, you can shoot an entire clip into an enemy at point blank range and the guy will still be alive. On top of this, enemies appear to respawn after a certain period of time. I had an instance where I had to defend an area from a wave of bandit. Once I killed the wave and got the mission complete notice, another wave came at me. My guess is that the game didn't register the mission complete or otherwise just reset the area to add a new horde, I don't know...

Anyway, [b] I HIGHLY recommend playing the game of the hardest difficulty, master. [/b] Why? because the way difficulty works in this game is that it adjusts the amount of damage that bullets do across the board as opposed to messing with NPC stats. This means that at higher difficulties, you are more vulnerable, but enemies are easier to kill. Weird, right?

[h2] Survival [/h2]

This game includes several survival mechanisms. You have to eat occasionally, you have to keep your radiation exposure down, your guns tend to jam in the middle of firefights, and you have a depleting fatigue bar. While you have a ton of inventory space, your character can only carry 50kg. If you go over this limit, you can still walk and run around, however your fatigue bar will deplete faster and once its depleted, your character becomes momentarily immobile. This is terribly annoying, especially because the distances you have to walk are vast and due to this mechanic, you simply can't sprint from point A to point B, you have to take your time.

[h2] The Mods [/h2]

Perhaps the worst anomalies in the game are the bugs. This game's code was scripted on a sheet of toilet paper. The game crashes for several random reasons. If you eat food directly out of a dead enemy's inventory instead of putting it into your first -- game crash. If an NPC spawns at the other end of the map with a disrupted code -- game crash. [b] I HIGHLY recommend getting the ZRP mod which updates the game and fixes some of these issues. [/b] There will still be issues with the mod, but at least the game will be somewhat playable. There are other mods as well that update graphics and completely overhaul the experience, so be sure to explore Nexus or simply google some STALKER mods.

[h2] The Verdict [/h2]

STALKER is a kind of curiosity. It's an early 2000s game that, despite its flaws and bugs, was undoubtedly a masterpiece for its time. Today, the game is somewhat dated when compared to newer games like Fallout that basically offer similar experiences in a more optimized and grander way. However, STALKER has a unique and unmistakable atmosphere that grips you from time to time. This game gets intense and the environment has a tendency to provide you with unexpected situations that almost seem like they're scripted, but are actually fully organic and random. 

It's a game worth checking out and definitely a game worth modding. At the core level, STALKER is an excellent FPS RPG that has a lot to offer. With a few mods installed, it can make for an epic experience and all at a fraction of the cost of a Bethesda title.",1703109245,1703109245,True,52,1,0.848846495151519775,0,True,False,False

Using your artifact detector and collecting/selling artifacts is so fun to me. Guns are sometimes a bit weird, ammo is rare, It's challenging with things like bleeding, radiation, elements, high damage enemies, and mutants that are varying in many ways, you have to work and progress for the cool armors you want. Certain zones and enemies you come across as well as anomalies require certain protection. Anomalies in these have all kinds of different types and there's even like hanging grass that smacks you if you get too close. There is a Freaking Message Log in your PDA (basically a pad that allows you to see achievements, Relationships with other factions, Every Word Spoken In The Game and the time/date it was said, as well as types of mutants, etc.) Not to mention there are plenty of factions to come across and learning about all of them is Wack.

If you're a newcomer to the series I highly recommend playing this and its sequels (Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat) before you go jumping into mods like Anomaly.

Yes the SoC is dated,  yes SoC is buggy and there are two reasons for that

Shadow of Chernobyl was originally intended to be released in 2003. GSC was too ambitious and it got delayed multiple times until THQ stepped in, the game got scaled back and was finally able to release in 2007. Judging by the textures in some of the areas of SoC I wouldn't be a bit surprised if those are the same textures used in builds from '03 and '04.

As for the bugginess, X-Ray engine has been a absolute nightmare even in development, however SoC and its sequel CoP are both stable enough to be played without mods. However if you do want to patch some existing bugs there is a mod for this came specifically called Zone Reclamation Project which cleans up many bugs in v1.0006 while keeping the game vanilla.

This game is pretty neat, has a somewhat interesting story that takes inspiration from Roadside Picnic, difficulty isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I highly recommend this. I wont spoil the story for you just go and play this. 

I give it an 8.5/10, SoC might be janky at times but do I care? Not really, STALKER's entire setting  and plot is great and I cant wait to see what GSC has in store for Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl/Chernobyl.",1489276206,1702501442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've tried finishing it both with and without ZRP, but it feels like I have to brute force my way through every area with trial and error rather than strategy and mechanical skills.

A lot of blockades have gaps in the hitboxes so the enemy can shoot straight through them even if there's nothing that visually indicates that they should be able to do so. Wooden boxes and such are obviously breakable, but concrete walls and metal containers shouldn't be.

I understand how the aiming works. You need to wait some time between each shot for them to deal full damage at max accuracy or whatever. This is just annoying and doesn't really work when there are enemies right up in your face. It would make more sense if your camera would sway or have it move with recoil, but it might not be supported or whatever with this engine since the game is from 2007. I don't mind the range limit of weapons so that isn't exactly a problem for me, but I'd rather be able to hit literally any of my bullets from close to medium range.

The story isn't particularly interesting. The atmosphere is cool though. A bit too dark sometimes and the flashlight doesn't exactly make it easier to see a lot of the time since it removes all contrasts. Kind of like driving in the city at night for someone that has astigmatism except for the massive lines shooting out from every light source.

Metro 2033 feels pretty similar to this game. That game has a more linear story without open world, but it feels way better to play and I actually care about the story somewhat. The stalker trilogy is pretty cheap on sale so it won't be a major setback for you if steams 2 hour return policy isn't enough for you to form an opinion, but it's not worth it at full price.

MODS: Now one thing I can't really stress enough, after my own recent experience is you really are better off just playing the game vanilla if it is your first time, now I was one of those people who played GAMMA and then came to the original trilogy looking to replicate the same experience.

Plenty of the classic random difficulty spikes of older games which I guess is neither here nor there if you know what you're signing up for, but still most times I died I felt annoyed by the inconvenience rather than sufficiently challenged. Gunplay often felt clumsy and rng based. I could fire at an enemy's head dead on with a whole clip and not get any feedback or the same scenario could result in a crispy one tap. 30 hours and I was never sure iron-sights gave me any mechanical advantage over hip-fire (scopes notwithstanding) and with the recoil animations often obscured the view so I found I was hip-shotting far more than felt right. I will say the enemy Ai made for interesting engagements and was just smart enough and perhaps more importantly the right kind of dumb for a game that gets more arcadey towards it's climax, however I signed on expecting stealth and there is little real stealth on offer here. That and there is a bug with stealth where loading a save in enemy territory would alert everyone in the area  putting the player in danger of a soft or hard-lock. Several of the faction quest givers I came upon were killed repeatedly on their first mission preventing me from what I can only assume was a decent chunk of optional content unless I would repeatedly backtrack through saves. I found that my usual survival horror instincts of hording useful or valuable items resulted more in overloading and impacting the already cumbersome movement mechanics, keeping me managing my inventory more than was fun or ignoring vast amounts of goodies on the ground. Tbf I ended up with hundreds of thousands of Ru which apparently was way too much given the greed ending only takes over 50k and there was little on sale more useful than new armor. Admittedly I played slowly and carefully, but having to be economical with resources didn't feel very rewarding or necessary given that guns and ammo only become more powerful and plentiful as you progress. The secret stashes mechanic was fairly interesting but sort of disincentivized exploration unless there was a marker on my map. Anywho definitely a game with potential. Some re-balancing and quality of life adjustments would work wonders here. Might check out the sequels or one of the various popular mods Like Gamma given I really wanted to like this one, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone without an immense amount of free time and an extreme curiosity for odd old games.",1702157741,1702158989,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Loot works very much like battle royale games in that you open the inventory of the downed person and transfer what you want back and forth - I suspect they originally stole it from STALKER. Prior to STALKER a downed enemy just shat weapons or whatever on the ground for you to pick up. There are no RPG stats, just better equipment, and the best part of that is that the equipment matters.A soft target is a soft target but some aren't as soft as others, and they know it. A bandit wearing a leather duster will keep there distance unless you act skittish and stay back waiting for them. You do that with military or other more heavily armed and armored types and they will push straight to your hiding spot.

The story is decent if you care about it, otherwise you can ignore it and just talk to a few people when safe and follow mission points on the map, and at times it is f***ing unforgiving. Guns don't have pixel perfect accuracy for starters. You use the starting pistol at any range beyond about 50 feet and you're never going to hit shit. You spray and pray and you'll never hit shit. You take your time and aim, and you're going to miss some because every gun in the game is old soviet hardware (and some made up) that has been through the wringer already. Groupings aren't always the tightest, but if you take your time and learn the ones you have, then head shots still drop most like flies, once you get some decent hardware.

You'll see some goofy mutant critters in the wild a bit, nothing crazy. 
Til it gets weird.

If you've never played STALKER, I highly recommend it. While the series is very similar in theme to the Metro series, this is due largely to the fact that their source material, or the original inspiration, is the same - the 1979 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. movie by Andrei Tarkovsky.

I get what the people praise it for ""Atmosphere"" I have finally deciphered what the american word means now
Its a spooky game , which makes you feel like to survive you have to scavange everything and be scared of all enemies cause you can easily die .
What i dont understand is ... did the americans not play THEIR older games
Its called well designed mechanics
you loot bullets and bandages and you can't just buy them , they feel scarce. getting like 20 bullets per enemy if you are lucky , and spending 8-15 , cause the early pistols are shit.. like.. there is no aim. there is a shotgun like spread. 
AND the damage is good enough to take you out fast if you dont cover and lean. No health regen. 

If there is a need , players will obviously use the mechanics

the mutants screwing you over and the russians talking random stuff all day 

also this game can become pretty much anything you want with all the mods out there
recommended mods :
-Zone Reclamation for Shadow of Chernobyl
-Absolute Nature for Shadow of Chernobyl
-Absolute Structures for Shadow of Chernobyl
-Shaders Max
-Stalker Weather Overhauled 3.1

To use mods with STALKER , you will first need to edit your fsgame.ltx -file found in the games install folder 
Open this file with a text editor like Notepad , and find the following line
$game_data$ = false| true| $fs_root$| gamedata
Change the false value to true , save the file
Now all you need to do is copy the mods gamedata folder into your own stalker dir
To merge or patch mods , keep overwritting the folder.",1547997480,1701356516,True,88,0,0.857313215732574463,0,True,False,False

My dad played this when I was six or so, hence I wasn't allowed to play it, but I watched him play over his shoulder and I vividly remember being fascinated by the graphics and gameplay. I can say the same for Clear Sky, too. But he never played Call of Pripyat.

Now, two decades later, I finally bought my first PC and the first game that came to mind when thinking of what to play was STALKER. There's nothing quite like the Zone and its atmosphere, even after all these years later with refined horror and better graphics. The story definitely felt kind of short, but if you're working full time and only have a bit of spare time in your week, like me, then the length of the game is satisfying; I completed it after two months of installing it. With this game done and knowing the story of Clear sky, I'm excited to start that, and still have a third game that I've never played as dessert.

My crappy laptop could barely run it but boy did I have an experience because it was terrifying. At the start the game seems quite bad. The game is very buggy and you will find the first mission doesn't go away after completing unless installing a mod. After you leave the first area all hell starts to break loose. Every now and again the games physics will break or crash unless you have a miracle. You almost create your own story from that point as every firefight you encounter will be different. The main story is very vague and there are many different routes that you can take to get around the situation. Walking as weird sense of tension that no other game brings. The randomness of firefights and mutants make sure you have a panic attack mid game. The level of immersion is absolutely astounding. Most people just leave the game after it breaks as they probably didn't give it a second chance. But do try to give it as many as possible, try out different mods and see what works for you. If you want a less buggy experience look for Call of Pripyat or wait for STALKER 2. But give this game as many chances as possible because it may be the best experience of your life because it sure is mine. This game isn't for everyone and will take time to love, but trust me, play it. There are many reasons not to play this game like the buggy engine or the air headed AI.

This game invoked memories of playing the original Half-life game.  It's filled to the brim with story, atmosphere, and gun-play.  This isn't a run-and-gun game like Call of Duty or Battlefield, as it requires some thought and strategy.  It's a survival FPS, so if you run out with guns blazing ... you'll die over and over.  It's a great prelude to the Metro series and requires similar tactics of scrounging around and trying to make every shot count while conserving your ammo (kill or be killed).

The Eastern European crowd have managed to push the engine to its limits and come up with some wonderful and often ""hardcore"" mods.  If you want to experience pain, desolation, and despair ... look towards Misery, Last Day and Dead Air.   If you want to enjoy the open sandboxness of the Exclusion Zone, try Anomaly.  There are quite a number of other mods out there, but I can't speak Russian and  can't comment on them.  

Stay ""Cheeki Breeki!"" and remember to always carry some spare vodka, ammo, and medkits/bandages; you never know when you'll run into a camouflaged bloodsucker or pack of blind dogs.

The game is amazing, the atmosphere and ambience S.T.A.L.K.E.R brings to the table is just unmatched and there are very few games even now that capture the bleak post apocalyptic vibe that stalker does. A lot of people complain about the gun play, and yes, the guns are pretty inaccurate and enemies are pretty spongy, but honestly once you get your hands on your first AK the combat really starts to pick up. As long as you keep progressing, you'll start to feel pretty overpowered closer to the middle of the game. The world feels really alive in a way that no other game from that era could have matched, and although the AI definitely shows its age, it never really felt dumb. I fully recommend this, apart from the very end of the game which falls apart a bit, the rest of the game is a real passion project. Already bought clear sky and am moving on to the next one

[b]SPOILER AHEAD[/b]

Like I said, the last hour or so once you enter the CNPP really sucked for me compared to the rest of the game, it focuses on the worst parts of the game as it basically dissolves into a hallway shooter with TONS of really tanky spongy enemies just thrown at you one after the other. And although ammo is definitely not in short supply here, and you do get an exo suit of your own if you choose to go for the secret lab canon endings, I found myself having to spam auto save because of bastard RPG troops blasting me from obscure angles and one shotting me. I definitely feel like the portal hopping section goes on for far too long and the game would have been better having the entire last part of the game after refusing to help the c-consciousness cut. 

[b]SPOILER DONE[/b]

Anyway, go buy these games, play them, and then jump into stalker Anomaly, which is a free combination of all three games' areas, with a very dynamic world and completely fresh take on the world of stalker from the perspective of someone who isn't the main character :D

І тоді я став бачити це скрізь, скрізь куди не глянь, ці бовдури, куди не глянь - роблять точно одне і теж знову, і знову, і знову, і знову, і Знову і думають, що зараз буде feature.
Ні, ні, ні, ні, ні прошу, зараз все буде інакше.
Вибач, мені не подобається як... Ти на мене дивишся.
Окей? У тебе проблеми з головою? Думаєш локшину тобі на вуха вішаю, брешу.
Пішов ти, окей? Пішов на хуй.
Все гаразд хахаха.
Я заспокоюся братик, заспокоюся.
Сенс у тому, гаразд
Сенс у тому, що я тебе вбив уже.
І справа не в тому, що я йобнутий, усік?
Це як вода під мостом...
Я вже казав тобі, що таке… bug?



Have I told you before? What is a bug, huh?
Bug... is the exact repetition of the same action every time,
In the hope of a feature, that's what a bug is.
The first time I heard it, I don't remember who said this shit, I BOOM, I killed it.
That's the point hahahaha... Okay? He was right,
And then I started to see it everywhere, everywhere you look, these assholes, everywhere you look, doing the exact same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and thinking it's going to be a feature.
No, no, no, no, no, no, please, this time it's going to be different.
I'm sorry, I don't like the way... You're looking at me.
Okay? Do you have a problem with your head? You think I'm pulling your leg, I'm lying.
Fuck you, okay? Fuck you.
It's okay, hahaha.
I'll calm down, bro, I'll calm down.
The point is, okay.
The point is, I already killed you.
And it's not that I'm a fucking idiot, okay?
It's like water under the bridge...

Yeah, it's pretty hard, yeah, you'll die a lot, yeah, maybe you'll rage up a bit. But, overall, it's fantastic. The artstyle and worldbuilding is pretty unique, if you look at one screenshot you'll easily recognize it. The gameplay and atmosphere, with the story, which I'll talk about in a minute, are the strenghts of this game. It's really rare for a horror game to continue being scarry after 15 hours, however, STALKER: SoC can do that for 40+ hours straight. And God, the atmosphere, it's superb, amazing really. 
The story is actually amazing too, it's simple, but it works like a charm. And the multiple endings are pretty neat too, even though there could be some better implementation. That's because, basically, the choices that alter the ending are kind of pretty late in the game, so you can just reload a save 5 hours prior to the ending and repeat it, following a guide from the wiki or whatever, and then boom, you've done all the endings. 
Now, the only negative aspect that I can point at is the late game. When you reach the final area things feel... rushed. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the final part, but it just felt... idk, off. It seems like the devs just spammed strong enemies for no reason at instances, and there's times where there's a room with like 8 dudes staring a wall or some shit. I'm aware of the dev hell this game went through, but still, I cannot ignore the fact that the end segment is worse than the rest of the game in those regards. 
Alas, this game is pretty good, very good tbh.

And it really does look terrific. The characters, the story, the gameplay still feel very fresh. The immersion is top-tier. The horror elements remain highly unsettling. Great ballistics modeling, plenty of guns and the tactical component to survival and battle is a potent blend of deliberate strategy and unmitigated chaos.

Yeah, still some CTD's now and again. Couple glitches, a bit of jank, nothing compared to the dumpster fires some AAA publishers put out. Stalker still runs fine in 2023. It's worth exploring everything, this game rewards curiosity. I never spoiled any of the story for myself in all these years, but it's terrific, in my opinion the plot totally delivers on the mystery and darkness of the Zone.

The plant itself is fantastic, surreal and epic. The endgame pays off nicely. I played on ""Master"" difficulty because this is the game that GSC originally created. It's a very hard game, however, so the publisher, THQ, made them implement difficulty levels at the last second, so players wouldn't be turned off by the game. You take less damage and do more damage, at various scales, on the lower difficulty levels. The hardest difficulty level is the game that GSC developed and playtested, and while very challenging, it's still quite surmountable. Don't wimp out, play it on Master!

This time, however, I was determined. The start of the game is quite rough. Your armor most likely couldn't protect you against paper cuts. Your gun and the sawed-off shotgun you can pick up in the first ""mission"" wouldn't be able to hit an enemy even if it was lodged inside of their skull. But I marched on, as the atmosphere and general intrigue was enough for me.

Once I got to Rostok, however, things changed. Guns could hit things. My armor did something, sometimes. The tactical gameplay suddenly became incredibly engaging as it no longer felt like I was fighting the game mechanics. I became a real fighting force in the Zone that bandits would fear. I looked forward to firefights.

The more atmospheric and claustrophic areas remain my favorites, however. You get really immersed in the story and setting, wanting to figure out what the hell is happening in the Zone as you progress through the story. The final few areas are also incredible. There's something about the feeling of [spoiler]walking through Pripyat and Chernobyl for the first time[/spoiler]. It's a very powerful, emotional feeling.

To mention some things I'm somewhat indifferent on, the UI can be somewhat clunky at times. A lot of side missions resort to ""go to X, kill/find Y, return"". Lots of backtracking. Luckily they aren't necessary. I ended up doing a few that ended up being on the path towards main objectives.

Overall, the game is a masterclass in making an incredibly atmospheric and immersive experience. The general gameplay also feels good (once you get weapons that can hit things). The game does show its age at times, but I found it to be mostly endearing.",1698703645,1698703645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got about 16 hours out of it from meandering around and pursuing side gigs near my next objectives, but with all the little missions and unmarked areas I never even touched, I could see others easily doubling that.
It's an FPS, but is not standard at all. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series places a heavy emphasis on slow-paced combat, teaching you (through death and terror) the ideal ranges for your weapons, how to clear corners, and when to just run away. When in the Zone, you'll quickly learn that you're close to the bottom of the food chain, and you'll be smart to fight like a coward.
The story is an above-average amnesia tale that sees you jump through hoops to learn who you are, but pays off in a big way. Though the game isn't flush with memorable characters, those who you do meet really stick with you for their wonderful (if repetitive) voice acting and lively dialogue.

Now the elephant in the room, ""Shadow of Chernobyl"" has some hilarious bugs and in my experience is prone to crashes during the latter half of the game. I didn't experience anything gamebreaking, but your mileage may vary. Examples of bugs I encountered were stashes that became empty if not looted immediately and remained marked on the map forever. There was also a bonfire that became cursed and started killing NPCs that chose to gather around it, seemingly pulling their bodies inside it.

I'm not sure how it's classified, but I think of it something like a survival horror lite FPS - some of the environments can be creepy (IMO) with various sounds from soldiers to various beasts and anomalies.  You have gear that degrades and gets worse, you have a hunger system (it seems it's only once a day).  For the most part, enemies (and you!) can go down with just one headshot no matter what difficulty (contrary to popular belief the difficulty levels aren't broken where Master is considered the ""easiest/fair/whatever) so fights can get tense - add to a bleeding mechanic where you have to be careful.  Anomalies around the world can hurt you as can Radiation.  You have a weight limit so you have to basically manage everything properly - ammo, health items, gear, etc.  There is a night system where the dark can be dark (though humans use flashlights which can make it easy to spot/target them. 

It's not without issues.  I find the game to be quite buggy even with the Zone Reclamation Project (unofficial patch which I recommend even if you don't use any other mod).. The game crashed a couple of times without warning. I had to restart once because everyone disappeared.  Now, its a living world and a lot of people can move around and get killed by something, but when I say everyone disappeared, i mean it - I would go to say Bar where not even the Barkeep was there.  You can find stashes which contain goodies, but only if you get the coordinates by checking the bodies of the fallen, however even this had issues with stashed being completely empty. I've seen people online say this happens if you open a cache before getting the coordinates, but this happened with ones I know I didn't open them.

Combat can be a bit annoying as well because human enemies can get staggered which means after the first bullet, you can't hurt them right away until they finish being staggered .  Of course, this doesn't apply to you and enemies can easily stunlock you.

The item degradation system is also annoying because there's no way to repair without enabling it (a Duty and Freedom guy) with the Zone Reclamation Project so you don't get to attached to the good stuff. There are plenty of replacements and you could technically repair armor with 4 or 5 artifacts of the same type of an anomaly (i.e. 4 or 5 Electtro Batteries and stand in an electro anomaly).

For the most part, the optional quests weren't special.  You get items and the quests that ask for a mutant part or artifact usually gives you as much as it's worth which is nice as Sid/Barkeep only buy them at a fraction, but eventually you meet Sakahrov in Yantar who will buy mutant parts and artifacts for full price and your money issues go away.  Early on, you just need to take advantage of the fact that items don't really disappear if dropped on the world (i.e. not in a body or certain boxes which do disappear) so early game is mostly just gathering the guns of the early enemies and carrying as much as you can to a trader.

I'e also always thought the game basically drops in quality once you get the Brain Scorcher quest and go to the Red Forest which basically leads to the end game.  At this point, the game basically just becomes a weak FPS IMO.  You go from exploring a living world as you battle small groups of foes here and there to fighting Monolith in large battles where you have to dodge Snipers (who you don't face until this point), radiation, and anomalies.  I guess I also started getting tired by the time i went to Lab-X-16 in Yantar when Snorks or whatever these four legged-human-zombie things were as they were more annoying to fight than anything.  End game basically just felt like a tedious slog compared to what came before as you go through areas fighting the soldier (and snipers) and later even helicopter as a timer counts down.  By this point, I just used Zone Reclamation Project to cheat in an invulnerability artifact. I  honestly started having fun again as i knifed the enemies while immortal.",1695938827,1695938827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's hard to describe a game that just vibes with you through and through in words. I remember getting it back when it was released and how blown away i was by how awesome it looked when i first booted it up (altho the animations were awful even for the standards back then), and how cool the atmosphere was.

And that's one of the biggest strengths of Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC) and really the whole STALKER game series: The atmosphere. Even after having played it more times than i can count, probably around a dozen times, i STILL get chills when i walk into certain areas. And even knowing exactly when and where certain enemies will spawn, i will still freak out, and i will flinch and get adrenaline spikes. No game gets to me quite like SoC.

I will probably fail miserably explaining what makes up the awesome atmosphere in SoC, but i will try anyway:
The setting (inspired by the 1979 movie Stalker / the book Roadside Picnic) is inherently pretty unsettling, with the world essentially having gone weird and dangerous in ""the Zone"". The music and sound effects absolutely contribute to that eery feeling of danger (shoutout to all the squeaky rotating lamps, you know who you are). And danger is everywhere, if not from enemies then because of potential radiation or anomalies that will simply kill you if you walk into them. Just going from one area to the next, you need to always be on the lookout. Which also adds a neat way of progression: The more you learn about anomalies and how they look and what they do, the better you will be as a ""STALKER"". Add to this a lot of armed conflict, and you'll be stumbling from one hazard into the next. You also have very limited carry weight, meaning you need to really think about how many weapons, ammo and meds you want to take with you. This is not one of those games where you can carry a whole arsenal, more than 2 or 3 weapons and you will struggle with being overburdened a lot.

All in all, if that's your kind of thing then the atmosphere is just fantastic and i can't think of many games whose atmosphere is even remotely as good. But atmosphere is also not the only thing the game has going for it, this can obviously be subjective but i think the gunplay in this game is exceptional as well. The guns just feel (and sound) good, you have a decent selection of different guns too. There are also a couple different ammo types (as in, regular and armor piercing ammo for the same caliber) and you can modify weapons too.

All that said, I'll be the first to admit that on a technical level, this game has issues, and a lot of them. There are tons of bugs, and the game also lacks polish. It's overall a pretty raw experience. To get to certain endings, you pretty much have to make use of walkthroughs.
That said, the game also has a pretty healthy modding community and various mods will help fix some of the bugs and issues. Even if you pick the game up for the first time, i would recommend to get at least some mods that keep the experience close to vanilla but fix bugs. And if you want to change the game more, there are plenty of mods to choose from as well.

Overall, what it boils down to is this: Do you like the atmosphere? If so, then that helps a lot in looking over some of the issues the game has and enjoying it anyway. Because if this is for you, it has the potential to be frikking amazing. And if you don't like the atmosphere, if you can look at screenshots and/or gameplay footage and be ""meh"", then it's probably not worth it and just not the game for you. For me personally, i have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on this game and i keep coming back to it even more than 15 years later because nothing else can quite scratch the same itch. It's not perfect, but i still love it wholeheartedly.",1695666582,1695666582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had been hearing a lot about the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series for a while, especially because of all the Anomaly (and GAMMA, to a lesser extent) content floating around on YouTube and other places. Finally got around to playing it after having bought it more than half a year ago, and I didn't regret a single dime, or a single second I spent on it. As suggested by everybody on the subreddit and on YouTube, I played it on the highest difficulty (Master) and disabled crosshairs. Also, worth noting is that I played it vanilla, in spite of everybody suggesting that one should at least install ZRP (bug fixes mod). In the almost 37 hours I played the game, I did not encounter a single bug, but I'd rather attribute that to my luck than the game being polished, because most players who went vanilla seem to have encountered at least a couple.

I'd start off by saying that its reputation as being a tough game is not without merit. The first couple of hours of the game are an absolute nightmare no matter how good a gamer you are, and that's an intended design choice. The ballistics are realistic, taking into account bullet drop and the fact that guns aren't accurate 100% of the times even in real life. The guns also take into account their range, which makes bullets disappear after they surpass their intended range. But that's as far as realism goes.

In Shadow of Chernobyl, there exists a complex RPG-style tier system for weapon calibres, which starts at your standard 9x18 mm pistol rounds, to 9x19 mm SMG rounds, to the 5.45 mm Warsaw Pact rifle calibre, to the 5.56 mm NATO calibre to finally, the heavy 9x39 mm subsonic rounds that only a few weapons chamber (not included 7.62 mm sniper rifle rounds and 12 gauge shotgun). Almost each ammo calibre has 2-3 variants as well, such as sniper rounds or armour penetration rounds. 

There also exist artifacts, which grant various kinds of buffs to the player such as electric or chemical protection, usually in exchange for an almost equivalent sacrifice the player has to make in another one of the 10-odd statistics, such as bulletproof cap or explosion protection. These artifacts are birthed in anomalies, which are pockets of phenomena formed as a result of the Zone's corruption of the laws of physics.

I describe the beginning as a nightmare because you'd be lucky to kill anything with the pistols, which feel like literal peashooters against even the weakest of enemies. That is, if you do actually manage to hit anything with them, because owing to SoC's game mechanics, you intentionally miss most of the shots you take with the cheaper, initial calibres, which sort of forces you to switch to NATO weaponry in the late game. It also strongly encourages you to aim down sights, and use optics as much as possible. Once you get a scope and get hold of your first rifle, the game mellows down in terms of difficulty and actually opens your mind up to the wondrous atmosphere it possesses.

I'm not much of a gamer, but I'm pretty sure that the atmosphere that the game builds is almost unparalleled. The way the world goes on without you, witnessed by the fact that almost any NPC can die no matter how important they were to the quests, and how they're just as fragile and prone to dying in the Zone as you are makes the world actually feel real. The game does a remarkable job of making you feel lonely and desolate while at the same time be on your toes. Mutants spawn randomly, and exhibit realistic behavious such as hunting in packs if they're dogs, sleeping, scavenging, etc which brings the world together. Daytime in the Zone is still doable, but nighttime will have you constantly on edge, and will make you want to sit by the warm campfire of a loner camp, or while your time away in one of the handful of friendly factions' bases, and wait for the night to pass as you stock up on ammunition and meds for the next excursion in the Zone.

All of this is up until you're above ground. Once you go to one of the few underground locations in the game, such as the Agroprom Underground or one of the X-labs, the entire equation changes. It doesn't matter if you're armed to the teeth with a PSZ-9Md Universal Protection armour and a G36, (both being some of the choicest of armours and guns in the game) the game ruthlessly does not allow you to lower your guard even for a split second, be it a Bloodsucker or a Controller, or the odd invisible poltergeist hurling boxes and barrels at you, or a human enemy lurking in the shadows before suddenly opening fire and killing you in a flash. The rewarding feeling that I experienced after making it through each of these areas was stupendous, because the game never makes you feel like a God. It rudely awakens you to the fact that no matter how well-kitted you are, even the most basic enemies can shred through you if you don't take a pragmatic, well thought out approach.

The lore is deep if you dig into it, and almost all of the factions seem logical if you adopt an unbiased perspective. Almost none of them are extreme enough for you to write off right away, and actually make you ponder over which one to support because they all seem valid choices.

Finally, I want to end this overly long wall of text by saying that that developers originally intended for a myriad of features that weren't in the retail release, like the ability to join factions which was added in the later games, (at least to my knowledge, because I've only just begun Clear Sky) and much more advanced mutant AI. The human AI is already way ahead of its time, with enemies exhibiting advanced tactics such as a few members of a group pinning down the player, while others flank them while they're not looking. The AI can be cheesed, of course, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's superior to that of most other games even today. The dynamic lighting is beautiful. To conclude, to anyone who has patience, and who doesn't play games for the sake of simulating a power fantasy should give it a try. All you need to keep in mind is that you're an ordinary dude, and also need to overcome the aforementioned initial hurdle of having pathetic weapons. After that, the Zone shall mesmerise you with its eerie but addicting allure, something that'll want you to spend a lot more time exploring instead of rushing the main quests, which I did, which is why it took me 37 hours to complete the game. Good hunting, stalker, may the Zone bestow the best artifacts upon you.",1694849856,1694887370,True,21,1,0.687781214714050293,0,True,False,False

These games are gems, but have a really awful coat of rust (bugginess and bad balancing and progression) that you need to scrape off using mods. Particularly Clear Sky, to the point I would recommend skipping that game entirely unless you enjoy having a bad time, and only play this game and Call of Pripyat instead.

For all three games, start by installing the ""_RP"" mods at a minimum to get the games functional and remove most all the game-breaking bugs and fix other issues when possible. That is ZRP for this game, SRP for Clear Sky, and PRP for Call of Pripyat. Refer to this guide after installing https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302750759&searchtext=modding
Some overhaul mods aren't compatible, so if you really want to be playing modder's megalomania then skip this, and lookup the file extractor to get whatever config files you need for further tweaks if necessary. 

These games have very active modding scenes, but mostly in Russian/Ukrainian, and for some reason STALKER modders tend to avoid the nexus like the plague and only use moddb, which is horrid in my opinion and makes it much harder to find the good mod(s) you're looking for.

The ""_RP"" patches tend to leave two/three problems in the vanilla game unfixed or half-fixed: Horribly inaccurate weapons, bullet spongey enemies, and (more debatably) carry weight.

To fix the inaccurate weapons, you'll need to find the dispersion values in three places and adjust them accordingly. Base dispersion is a value added together and measured in whole degrees, and if you tweak dispersion to end up in the negatives then you'll essentially start re-introducing it.
-The player character's several ""disp_"" values in gamedata > configs > creatures > actor.ltx
-Each individual weapon's .ltx in gamedata > configs > weapons
-And also the ammo used by the weapons (why???) in gamedata > configs > weapons > weapons.ltx
The ones in actor.ltx are tricky and seem to use some odd formula which also seems to vary between games. In this game - SoC - ""disp_aim"" seems to be multiplicative off ""disp_base"", so setting it to a low number like 0.0167 (1/60, essentially converting the whole degrees of dispersion into arcminutes as it should be) seems to be enough to fix the issue with no further changes.

Bullet spongey enemies is a surprisingly, weirdly multi-faceted issue in SoC that I don't fully understand. The simplest way to fix it is to go into ALL weapon .ltx files and set ""time_to_aim"" to 0, and then in-game always aim for the head - which does 10x damage. Doing more than this is complicated, but I'd also go into gamedata > configs > creatures > m_dog.ltx (the file for wild dogs) and reducing their health to 50, because they somehow survive 3 headshots otherwise.

And the last (debatable) issue usually untouched by the _RP patches is carry weight. It's in gamedata>config>creatures>actor.ltx and gamedata>config>system.ltx as several terms involving ""weight"" and ""mass"". Make sure the walk weight is the higher number while the others are all the same.

And with that you're ready to start having a much smoother experience. I'd personally suggest playing both SoC and CoP ""vanilla"" (with just these modifications done) as a first playthrough, and skipping Clear Sky because it's a fucking mess.",1694793082,1694793082,True,4,1,0.521185159683227539,0,True,False,False

Tip, play on Master difficulty, even if you suck. Find the Merc suit hidden in the starting village. Try to find an AK as early as possible. Use the box in the bar to store items. Game gets easier quickly. Final missions are highly radioactive, so wear an appropriate suit. 

A high replayability due to the multiple endings and the fact that already very early game you influence the game’s outcome without actually realising. 

I hope STALKER 2 won’t ruin the experience.

Weirdly enough, Shadow of Chernobyl might be my least favorite to play out of the main-line trilogy. Many believe it is the best game out of the bunch. I do not necessarily disagree, but to me the campaign feels a little too long and the gameplay mechanics are a bit thin. However, those comments do not stop SoC from being an absolutely essential experience. Anyone who can withstand some endearing jank and is interested in the origins of modern titles like Metro, DayZ, and Escape From Tarkov should take a look at S.T.A.L.K.E.R., starting with Shadow of Chernobyl. The Zone simply provides an experience unlike any other in gaming. I was glad to be back with the first of the series and I know it won’t be long until I return again.

Review as a first time player in 2023:

Truly one of the best ""live-in"" FPS I've ever played. You can just idle at times, do your own side things for people and be part of the world. You feel so small and unimportant. Few characters will ever fully trust you. They all can die. Even on easiest settings you can be deleted almost instantaneously if you're ambushed or out of cover from a single enemy, and they're usually in numbers.

It's magical and held together with sticks and twine. Jankey, some dialogue is misspelled, stuttering when loading in area objects due to outdated X-Ray engine, crashes, map markers that stay after finishing quests, or in the wrong location, objects that take up inventory space after quests that you can't remove, bullet and enemies clipping through walls, items through floor, etc. I got soft locked in a wood attic once.

Mechanics:
Weight limits, grid inventory, ammo types, weapon attachments, weapon jams, durability, hunger, radiation, electricity/fire damage, day/night cycle, pda log, separate heal and bleeding bandages, belt slot for artifact perks, independent npc routines, etc.

Despite the bugs, despite the age. 
[i]Fantastic. [/i]
New one is very close to release, but this is absolutely worth the play
if you like older, harder games.

I honestly don't understand all the comments about how the game has not aged well, poor gun play, it needs mods, etcetera. I think we're too spoiled, but even then ... this game from 2007 does the environment and gun play better than most modern games in my opinion. 

We never were some ""savior of the world"" like in Bethesda games, nor do we have to progress the main story in any way until we want to. After all, why should we rush blindly after we got ""killed""? We are just trying to survive in the zone like everyone else. I really like how the game is not centered around the protagonist (or complete thunder c-nt if you choose to be lmao), as you can be walking around and see some place get raided or NPCs fighting one another. A good example of this is usually the Garbage or Agroprom. 

I actually like the graphics. I may be biased, since I grew up with Halo: Combat Evolved and Counter Strike: Source, which look very similar, but after looking through the negative reviews I thought it would be much worse than it was. 
Another thing that I really liked is how the guns actually feel different than one another. A 7.62x39mm will actually ""feel"" different than a 5.45x39mm or a 5.56x45mm. 

The game is not without its issues though. It is pretty unstable at times. I've crashed multiple times in certain areas which is annoying ASF. It's not game-breaking level of crashing - I would say it's a bit better than unmodded Fallout: New Vegas (One of my all time favorite games), but annoying and breaks immersion sometimes. Sometimes, artifacts will glitch in the ground, especially the circular ones. Also, it's really annoying to be given random quests without talking to anyone (usually defend or wipe an area) since they are timed and the OCD inside of me hates failing them. I have not seen anything truly game breaking yet though, but I am sure there are a lot that I have simply forgotten about or missed.

Overall, I honestly wouldn't buy this game for $19.99 or the bundle for $39.99. They are too old to be priced so high imo. I would wait until it's on sale and then buy it then.",1693779247,1693779247,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Atmosphere is fantastic, graphics in 2023 is nothing special but it is old game after all so can´t take any points there. 
Some side missions are a bit boring but you don´t have to play those unless you want more money. Game is hard. (not like new games where normal = easy, it´s more like normal = hard.) (Which isn´t bad thing.)
There´s multiple endings so replayability is there.

Unless you thought Chernobyl was in Belarus or Russia, in which case you should probably look it up on a map.

This, along with Deus Ex, and the original Half Life would have at one point been strong contenders for best single player FPS games of all time. Though time has brought some stiffer competition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is at worst a very good albeit flawed game. 

Story? Uh, well you awake in a fictionalized version of the exclusion zone which has fantastic threats such as anomalies that kill people in brutal ways and mutants with psychic powers. Any more details than that are firmly rooted in spoiler territory. The game has open world elements including randomly generated side missions, shopkeepers, loot to sell, respawning mobs, etc; but I never found most of it worth messing with and just rushed through the story. The actual writing for the story isn't particularly interesting, but the build up to actually setting foot in Chernobyl was amazing, and the lorebuilding around the setting is pretty neat. Reaching a new location is a big deal because each new location feels very different, with very different hazards, mutants, and factions inhabiting it. You can't just run straight to Chernobyl either, as there's several story bottlenecks you have to deal with either in order to proceed in that direction or in order to proceed in that direction safely.

OK, gameplay. It's a shooter alright. Although more specifically it's the ""everyone has low health"" type of shooter. Guns are also fairly inaccurate and get less accurate and reliable as their durability deteriorates, which can make firefights either very tedious at long range or very sporadic quick affairs up close, depending on your weapons.  Armor also has durability to keep track of, in addition to offering different types of protection. In the unmodded game you can't repair durability outside of abusing a glitch using equipped artifacts. Oh right, artifacts. The hazards in the game, called anomalies, often have artifacts near them which have a variety of passive buffs and penalties if you equip them. These aren't just items you equip or sell, they actually are the entire reason why people are in the exclusion zone to begin with so there's some neat integration of gameplay and world building.

There's also several different factions and a variety of unique mutants to fight. Some factions will be friendly to you, others not. They also use different equipment and represent highly variable challenges. Early on you mostly fight poorly equipped bandits, but then later on you'll fight factions of well equipped mercenary/military forces whose body armor actually absorbs a lot of bullets. The mutants vary from blind dogs that attack you, to ghostly enemies, to mostly invisible monsters that take most of your health out in a melee strike, to even a few mutants that use psychic powers.

The game also has fairly good AI. Enemies will take cover, occasionally reposition or even sometimes advance on your position, and NPCs will attempt to fight off hostiles if they encounter them on the road or they approach their camps. They do not use grenades though, and you should be very thankful they don't. 

This game has 2 spinoffs and a proper sequel on the way despite, ya know, the country the studio is in being hit by artillery strikes. There's also a few fan projects to create mods to improve the visuals of the game or change a number of other gameplay factors such as improving enemy AI.  So even if you beat the game, there might be a reason to come back to it.",1692937001,1692937001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This title has quite the reputation as the ""post-apocalyptic survival simulator"", which is due to the overwhelming amount of realism mods in the community. Should you go into this title thinking you are going to play a single-player Tarkov without any prior understanding, you're going to have a bad time.

Take my word - Play this title on hardcore. This is the true ""realism"" gunplay that everyone is talking about. The difficulty mostly modifies damage and health, meaning that it is often EASIER to play on Hardcore than it is Normal.

-Playing on Normal, every enemy will be a bullet sponge, and you will find yourself frustrated more than anything. Gunplay will feel more like Fallout 4 on Very Hard, you will always be low on ammo, and you will probably have to take awkward bold-faced approaches.

-Playing on Hardcore, enemies will die in around 1-3 well-placed shots, but so will you. You are forced to take this game at the pace it was intended, which may sound like an insult, but is actually it's strong suit. You will have to think tactically to overcome the enemy, making almost every encounter satisfying.

This game is based on the book ""Roadside Picnic""by Arkady Strugatsky who has wrote many Russian scifi novels in the 70s, many censored by the Russian government. I highly recommend reading the book since it will give you background on stalkers (why stalkers do what they do and the consequences of their actions), organizations involved, why the government is hostile to stalkers. Is the game accurate to the book? No, it's very different but the concepts are all there.

I've owned this game since it came out and is by far my favorite game of all time (I started playing video games on an IBM PC DOS 1.0, ""Decathlon"" and ""Zork""), the environment, ambient sounds, game play and overall experience is like no other. To be clear its a Ukraine built game so its not easy or forgiving, progress through this game can be a grind and demoralizing at times. At times you will need to guess at what you need to do because the directive may not be clear, that can be typical of games coming out of the former Soviet Union, just refer to online content to help you through. Be prepared to run out of ammo, health, and death comes with little explanation or warning. With that said you do not have to engage every enemy, if you engage everything you will run out of ammo, sneaking is very key in this game. Explore everything, even if some places look impossible to reach most likely you can reach it, again nothing is easy in this game. In the very beginning of the game if you are a good explorer you will find items before you start venturing out that will help you immediately. The best loot is in the toughest spots!

The game is best played at night with no lights on, it will help you to be fully immersed into the game and the environment. 

FYI - their is an updated version for better graphics if you are willing to search the internet for.

You either forget to save and get set back a large amount of time, or you save too quickly and end up getting yourself stuck in a tough position. The world feels very alive and out of your control for the most part. You can have a quest where you need to go meet somebody, just for them to get killed right in front of you (Completely unscripted.) and now your game is screwed up.

You'll have to install ZRP to fix a handful of bugs though, since the game hasn't aged very well, and continues to decline with newer hardware. One notable issue I had is when scripted enemies refused to spawn until I reloaded my save, and even then it was a 50/50 chance of it working. Stealth is also kind of janky, and enemy alert states are seemingly preserved across saves, so I don't recommend trying to stealth the Agroprom mission until you're able to mostly work around the bugs.

The main quests are also kind of repetitive, mostly amounting to [spoiler]going to a location, picking up documents, and fighting off military/monolith as you escape[/spoiler] but the story and world building are super cool so it's forgivable.

4500,142998359,76561197993464013,689,404,49,0,49,1690416237,"Two quick disclaimers:
1 - I played with the Memories of the Zone mod which made the game run outside of Steam which is why it shows such a low hour count.
2 - This game is only recommended to people who like a challenge. Enjoy stuff like the ArmA series? Then this might be for you. But if you are looking for a fast paced arcade shooter then you will not like this game.

Pros:
Worked out of the box with my 21:9 monitor at 3440x1440 and ran smooth. Not sure if that was the mod's doing but I love not having to tinker with a game to get my ultrawide to work.
The character movement is some of the best I've encountered in an FPS before. Looking around with a mouse is somehow smoother than anything I recall playing and you can see the character readjust his aim with lateral movements. It feels very real without coming off as sluggish.
The combat is quite punishing. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, getting shot by an enemy 5 yards away is pretty much a 1 or 2 hit and quit. Be smart and use cover. The game features a normal crouch and an even lower crouch which is a nice touch. Would be nicer to go prone but oh well.
Medkits aren't magical cure-alls. It is more like an RPG where it causes your health to rise by a certain number of points per second or something so the effects are delayed. While using one or bandaging a wound, you can't use your weapon which adds to the immersion and the importance of valid cover.

Cons:
New people coming into the series will struggle so you must have patience. There is virtually no tutorial at all so much of the game is figured out the hard way.
There is a minor semblance of stealth in the game but it is primitive by today's standards. Basically you can sneak to make it easier to not be detected but if you shoot someone with a suppressed weapon, even if it is a 1 shot kill to the head, every else will be alerted and start running around trying to figure out where the shot came from. I can see it being a realistic thing if they were in the same room but people outside a building while it is raining? That's a bit much.
Trying to figure out where to go next is frustrating sometimes. The locations on the map don't always update. Probably bugged from getting my butt killed and having to load up a save but still.

Neutral:
The sound effects are pretty good for the time. Not sure if that is due to the mod or not, I haven't played the vanilla game in so long. Though many of the sound effects for minor things like walking/jumping etc are weaksauce.
Probably just a result of using that mod but none of the voicing was in English. You can read most conversations in text but sometimes there is no text and someone is simply speaking to you so I have no clue what is going on. I didn't see an option to change it in the settings and people online said workarounds to fix it caused other sound issues so I didn't mess with it.
The game world is very drab and samey with grainy textures that don't suit to my liking but I get why they did it. Just a personal preference so I won't fault them for that.

Overall:
This game came out during my college days so I didn't have the money to get it until many years later. I only briefly played it but it was buggy and crashed a lot.

It took me more than the average player to complete the story (thus completing the game), about 80+ hours or so, since I didn't steamroll through the Story, so I have to talk about it.

If you enjoy any modern Fallout, Metro, Half Life as well as Survival Horror, Sci-Fi and Open World (who doesn't?) then you should totally play Shadow of Chernobyl. You need to have a knack and love for older video games to truly enjoy it but regardless it is a very enjoyable experience. The hardest difficulty possible is recommended for everyone. If you've been spoiled, play it anyway, there's nothing like it.

The gameplay is very junky and clunky and the gunplay is horrible unless you're in the late to end game sections where you can blast everyone's face off at point-blank range, but the world and atmosphere that keep on delivering are worth the struggle and effort it will take to power through the early and kind of annoying sections of the game. There's a huge variety of armor and weapons, and although the game is in First-Person only, you won't be able to see your character but the right setup will make you feel the effects of whatever you're using, and while the game doesn't offer anything substantial in the department of customizing your weapons, there are Unique variants and certain firearms that have attatchments available for use. Artifacts are one of the main attractions of loot and currency, and if you don't go exclusively for the story you will be able to simulate the simple scavenger and hunter experience of being a Stalker, it is a viable pastime and the game can go on for a lot longer than usual if you choose to interact with the factions and people of importance in the Zone. Exploration is also always rewarded and most of the time it is done so handsomely. most of the gear in the game can be acquired and experienced by simply looting dead enemies and revealing stashes around the Zone. These activities as well as radiant-type quests that have little next to zero lore are what the game offers aside from doing the story, but you can also do more important quests for bigger players of the Zone, breaking the monotony, allowing for small breaks between story missions that might have drained you of resources or seemed too difficult. That doesn't mean that the story doesn't supply you with gear much better than what you might currently have. This way you can focus exclusively on the story, although it is much more preferable to roam the Zone and see what you can scavenge, it will make the game and the world feel a lot bigger, although it is safe to say that for a game of it's age it has handled and performed very well within the world it is generating. There''s a variety of horrors and stories to be found within the Zone too and that keeps the intrigue growing and makes the setting a lot richer without saying much, I wouldn't consider it an exposition dump either since the messages you receive or the cutscenes you see are either sparse and/or brief.The game can be difficult but everything mentioned really redeems it. There's a heavy military feel to it and a great story and faction system that make the Zone feel a lot less alien, moments of returning to The Bar or being aided by Duty soldiers in the area lift you from the deafening loneliness of the Zone and remind you that the place is desolate and strange but somewhere nearby there might be a friend but also a sprawling enemy checkpoint. Mutants also stalk your shadow, and the right buyer will pay for the right monster-mash, so treading on Skinwa- I mean Bloodsucker territory can prove deadly but also rewarding, allowing you to access more jobs and quests for things you may already have. In short to that, there is no shortness of jobs and offers and loot to be had in the Zone alongside a futuristic and mysticist tale. With every step, every military base, every lab you come out alive of you will feel even more powerful having learned much from your endeavors, this game will keep rewarding you with the feeling of the conquer constantly, even if you choose to mostly play the story. Graphically it has it's own early 2000s aesthetic polygon look and I'd say that while not fancy it is kind of timeless to me.",1689902721,1689902721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm pretty sure it only changes textures and such so you'll basically get the vanilla game 'as it was meant to be played' with some minor tweaks and optimizations.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Despite its notorious amount of bugs (which are easily fixed with well-known mods and community patches for the game), the mechanics of this game and its rather considerable difficulty (at least when compared to other first-person shooters) make it very entertaining to play through. Don't come into this game expecting some masterfully crafted plot or anything of the sort. The story does just its job of giving you a reason to move forward, while also staying out of the way so you can take in everything the Zone has to offer.

No game has come close to being as immersive and having such a good atmosphere as the STALKER games.

There is lots to do like quests, exploring the zone, artifact hunting, trading or just go gun blazing againts enemy STALKERS and mutants.

ive played all the metro games (2033, last light and exodus) and a few fallout games (NV, 4) and i find stalker SoC to be a very different yet similar game. its like a combination of 2033/last light's supernatural behaviors and 4's more broad exploration across the map. this game is amazing and too me hasnt aged a bit. usually when i played older games i mod it first for a smooth experience, but this game was developed so smooth in '07 that it feels like a modern game just with lesser graphics. i havent gotten too far into the game but this is definitely a must play for everyone

my only dislikes about this game is that exploration isnt really that good since theres no environmental stories or loot (other than a few artifacts and ammo) to be gathered. theres also no fast travel which isnt really ideal in a game with this big of a map. other than that, this game is really really good

In my opinion, the best part of the game is that no matter how well equipped you are or how far in you get, you never feel like you have the upper hand, and you never do. Death is always around the corner. 

My one criticism of this game is how resources are not as scarce as I remember and I'd honestly prefer if ammo and supplies were that much harder to come by for an even more intense experience, but I'm sure there's a mod for that.

Have you ever wanted to experience being at the crossroads between the Backrooms, Metal Gear Solid 3, and Missing 411? Maybe the average person would run away, but this here is where I belong. 

The gameplay feels a bit like Ghost Recon during shootouts, except you constantly horde up items from the dead so you can create your little AK-74 blackmarket. It's such a pain because you can't hold that many items, but free guns are nice. Early in the game, you mostly come across AKs, Makarovs, and shotguns, but later on, the firearm selection grows. Grenades are real effective. My favorite gun was the G-36. 

If you like guns and the paranormal, with a slight pinch of survival horror, this action adventure shooter is a must play. I must sound so late to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience, but I think I'm here at exactly the right time. It's too bad there is no gun cleaning kit in the game, so it's like Fire Emblem style weapon life spans. The recoil and gun spread feels so good though, even though the pistol is too accurate, but overall it feels far closer to reality than your average shooter game. They even included gun jams. The enemies are pretty good too and have pretty realistic swarm tactics while keeping a safe distance, for humans with guns that is. The tunnels underneath The Zone are just the stuff of nightmares. I already almost died down there when some ultraterrestrial psychic anomaly was doing a telepathic palm strike to turn my consciousness inside out, which was depicted a little too well.

After a while of playing the game, I did seem to enjoy it for the most part. I played the first half of the game with horrible resolution as the game does not automatically adapt to your monitor/computers resolution, but after messing with the settings a bit I was able to get it looking better. Game crashes a lot, and I mean a lot. It's pretty hard to play this game for an hour straight without the game just giving up on you with no error log at all, and me personally I wasn't able to find any solutions except messing around until the game finally didn't give in.

Couple of the problems I had in particular was crashing heavily in the Dark Valley for no reason at all, right next to lab X18. Another one was near end game, saving anywhere near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant would result in an instant crash. Using any consumables from looting corpses would result in an immediate crash too, but that got easy to figure out and avoid. The story is rather short if you just dash through it, although you will have difficulty barriers if you rush the story but you can find your way around it if you're good enough with combat and tactics. You have options to take enemies silently or in head on combat, both of which have pretty nice mechanics but the A.I. can be a bit buggy. There are multiple factions in the game you can befriend, which befriending them will let you have your weapon out around them without having them get aggressive but it doesn't really seem to have any use other than that. You can't join factions, and you don't really get any benefits. The entire scientific area of the game kinda seemed useless to me, you do a couple missions there and then it's too inconvenient to travel all the way back to actually want to continue doing anything there. The map is large, but there are no fast travel mechanics. This sometimes feels like a problem when there are only three vendors on the map, which feels more like two since once again, one is in the scientific area. Military just meta-games the entire time and shows up everywhere the second you're escaping so they can come and kill you, and I won't elaborate any more on factions since I know I'll make a couple fans angry. (Lots of disputes between the community about which faction is the best.)

If you're looking for extra content such as helping the factions miscellaneously or just doing whatever yourself for roleplay purposes, you can, yet don't expect to get anywhere. The few missions you can get that aren't the main story are basically just go kill this pack of mutants here, or go find this random artifact here, or go kill this random dude in the middle of nowhere because he looked at me funny. The rewards for them are small and often make them not worth it but you can pass some time by knocking them out. I wish they expanded on the arena more since you can go 10 rounds through it before no longer being able to progress. I have never bought anything from a shop vendor throughout my entire time playing except the occasional food or ammo to survive, and in the end game it's pretty hard to find ammo for the guns who actually matter. Chances are if you find a unique weapon, you'll have to turn them in to someone for a quest, but luckily the game gives you the option of just ignoring them entirely which is something I like. Even when doing the main quests. Don't want to do something? Just say something along the lines of ""Uhh, no, I don't feel like doing it right now."" and you can pick it up again at any time you wish.

Beyond this there will be SLIGHT spoilers, so quick warning. Other than that I feel like the ending was pretty stupid, like you just took out all these dudes and mutants and almost died after seeing these horrific monsters in these horror labs and such, and you're getting quickly radiated in the power plant and are due to die in a bit, and you can wish for anything you want, and you chose to ""get rich""? It seems pretty stupid to me, so the ending was a bit disappointing.

Anyways, in conclusion, for 24 dollars I did find myself enjoying the game for the while that I had it, but I probably won't be going through it again. I never did play it with mods and I heard there are a lot of them that fix most of the bugs, add more gameplay, and make the graphics better, as well as anything else you want, but since the game was made in 2007 it doesn't really make sense to judge it on the graphical parameters. Though, the game doesn't really seem like it was ever updated to fix some of the problems it has since it's still in super early versions, but that's all I have to say.",1686048605,1688370772,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-I think it aged pretty well

-Top tier atmosphere

-The guns feel so weak and inaccurate for the first couple of hours of gameplay.
-This game is quite buggy, and sometimes crashes for no reason.

I remember spending long nights discovering the zone and its creepy anomalies, it felt as the most immersive post apocalyptic game I've ever experienced and the ambiance scared me to death and made it the most memorable pc game i never finished. 

Now i'm thirty I've decided to play the series fully and in order, and oh boy Shadow of Tchernobyl delivered more than expected. 

It's an immersive FPS Shooter/SIM where everything feels gritty and unfriendly. 
""The Zone"" is unforgiving and always throwing something at you. 
The game never takes you by the hand and punish the unprepared, several times during the journey. 

Level design is still really good to this day, from huge landscape to hangar to old factories, nuclear plants and old sewers full of dangerous beings that want you dead. 

There's many factions that inhabit the world, stalkers, military, bandits and more as you dwell into the main missions.  
The scariest encounters would be the lethal anomalies and deformed monsters roaming free and trying to end you at every turn. 

Story is mysterious, engaging graphics are a bit dated but still feels quite good and immersive to this day. 
The fan base community of this game is dedicated and so are the mods that could enhance your experience with the game. 
I recommend everyone to try this franchise with all my heart because it deserves it. 

Good luck fellow stalker!

The blend of survival horror, strategic shooter, and a little bit of an rpg element really shine in this game. The shootouts are tense and erratic for most of the game and the zone's atmosphere is dreadful but the best parts of this game are when you're underground. The horror belongs in these creepy, damp, and barren areas, and I think just about every ""monster"" moment was terrifying. They aren't used often but the first time an invisible creature just barely passes by you and you have to question if you had actually seen anything will forever be implanted in my brain. These moments are what make this game so good and despite the enemy AI being put together with sticks and stones and the game is slapped together with duct tape, the systems in this game keep it interesting and fresh. Which brings me to my biggest complaint about SOC; the story. Although the zone as a whole will fill the player with a sense of curiousness, the story will only add more questions then it actually answers, even with the ""true"" path. There's so much set up but you gain so little information about the factions and the world and even yourself. I was so confused if the twist was actually a twist that I had to look it up just to double check I was right. Luckily the story is simple enough and you're so preoccupied with what's happening you probably will forget half the mission objectives. The worst contender though is the ending, (spoiler stuff) it's really cool that there's so many different endings and they are fun to get but also they are based on really specific things so most players will end up with the ""rich"" ending which felt a bit out of place considering I had a fairly normal amount of money. The two true endings are a bit more satisfying but are still a bit anti-climatic and once again slightly incoherent. One of them sees you having to battle through the WORST area in the game. It's just an enemy dump till the game decides you're done and then it just ends?? It's not even particularly difficult it's just not fun to go through especially wearing the armor that stunts your run. Despite that I think that the ending cutscene is interesting it's just the pain to get there it really isn't worth it. I know I've complained a lot about this game but I really do love it and I think it's worth experiencing, even the bad stuff. There's a lot of charm and ambition here even if some of it is untapped.

The story in this one is alright, pretty simple but it's not S.T.A.L.K.E.R's strong point, that title goes to the enviroment and gameplay, the areas are well made and there are some details that make it better like hidden boxes that contain loot, some spots with weapons hidden in a huge anomaly field, or the fact that it is faithful to the actual exclusion zone in a few places. The combat aspect though, is my favorite part in the game, the A.I. is actually smart, they actually flank you, they push you when you open your inventory or start looting someone's corpse to take advantage of your vulnerability, they can be easily killed by hitting a headshot and the same applies to you.

Now, something else the franchise is known for is bugs and jank, it's an old game and it's engine can be quite glitch and crashy, I didn't find many bugs as much as others have experienced but they were definitely there, but there is a mod that fixes most of them and CTDs, so if you want to experience less bugs and crashes use the Zone Reclamation Project.

Lastly, the modding capabilities in all of the 3 games is really big, there are hundreds or maybe even more than a thousand mods for these games, be it russian or english, many to fit your tastes on how STALKER should be and quite fun to play after finishing the games. Just one very very big tip: never ever play anomaly, it's a waste of time and a pathetic attempt at a stalker mod, it is nothing like the actual stalker games and instead some tarkovified pile of trash.

-Play in rookie mode. It's still pretty hard for a first run, and when you grab the philosophy of the game it's very enjoyable and still challenging at times. Not a walk in the park. Foes leave plenty of weapons and ammo and usefull items. You won't have to search each corners and houses and corpses to find common items since you're very likely to find a lot of them. Rare items as well are imo easier to gather and are not indispensable to complete the game anyway.  That's something less to manage and feel anxious about. You won't get headshot and die too fast, especially in the last bit which is very hard in normal difficulty. You won't be too much annoyed with armor and weapon limited lifespan since they wear out slower. Armors are particularly hard to find in the map and you don't want to end up naked in a firefight.
-Don't do sidequest. They are boring, useless, time consuming and often buggy. The map is not that big but there is no fast travel and foes you killed automatically respawn. You'll get bored fast.

Shadow of Chernobyl's gameplay is ahead of its time and while some aspects seem a bit dated such as its gunplay, its presentation and visuals still showcase some amazing set pieces many years after its release. While not specifically ""survival horror"", it sure creeps into the player's skin and psyche. Everything wants you dead and the game makes it that although you're the player character, you're just another Stalker in his journey of the Zone.

Whether you want to play unmodded or modded, you're in for an unforgettable ""innawoods"" experience that will keep you hooked.

End note: while not vanilla/purtist friendly, I personally recommend looking into the OGSR:GA mod for updated visuals and enhanced gunplay. Radiophobia 3 is also an excellent mod but be prepared for an unforgiving experience.",1686609245,1686609245,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The characters don't actually have any spoken dialogue excepts when you walk next to them and they a little phrase like ""What are you looking at?"" or ""Go away"".

One thing I do agree with is playing the game on Master difficulty. The AI is pretty dumb, so they're a cakewalk on the lower difficulties. Even on Master difficulty the game is pretty easy if you check every nook and cranny for loot as the game rewards exploration. 

With all that said, this game is not for everyone. If you're not a fan of slower, tactical shooters, you will not like this game.

It was crazy hard but the atmosphere made me emotionally attached to the game through all these years. I wasn't able to make it half-way even back then.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was released in 2007. It is a gritty story-driven first person shooter made by a small team in Ukraine with less to no resources. The team behind it (GSC Game World) later had to disband due to financial issues in 2011. Though in 2014 they got together again and we're expecting for ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2"" to hit the shelves in 2023.

It's roughly based on 1971 Soviet novel ""Roadside Picnic"" written by Boris & Arkady Strugatsky. And I have to say it's closer to the original material than Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 movie ""Stalker"". Though Tarkovsky's movie is awesome too. The book is awesome as well, just finished reading it today. As for the game, the atmosphere is great, music is alright and the story is OK I guess.

Coming back to it today, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is still pretty much playable and enjoyable as it was back in the day. Keep in mind that this is the game of an underpaid, mostly self-taught, tiny Ukrainian Game Development Studio and it does not compare to most AAA games as you would expect. It doesn't have face animations, doesn't have voice acting for the most part, some of the voice files doesn't even have English versions. But what's in it is good, and the combat is gritty, and the combat AI is unforgiving, and the economy is pretty well balanced. So most of what's in the game, works good, better than most of the AAA junk they put out every year.

One of my all time favourites. Look up a few gameplay footage and see if you could do with the dated graphics and whatnot.",1577909956,1686142968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is definitely not akin to a standard open world title, and playing like you would approach a Far Cry game will get you killed. The world is organic and each NPC has their own routine and life while you are just another individual in this world.

You should approach firefights as you would in real life. You should also always be careful, since waves of migrating mutants, thieves and stray bullets from faction wars might end your life in mere seconds. Each second, even in friendly enviornments, can be your last.

Strangely enough, they also use all of this organicity and danger to bring forth one of the most humane games of all time. One of the most enticing moments you can have in gaming is chilling in Shadow of Chernobyl, sitting down by the campfire together with your fellow stalkers while one of them plays a guitar. The quiet, peaceful atmosphere is a fundamental part of the loop and it helps making this trip through this absolutely dangerous hellscape somewhat beautiful. Just wish the story had the same sense of humanity, but the lore is cool and I liked it regardless of some bonkers ideas here and there.

If you don't mind the fact that this is a game where you'll rely on quick saves, and also the fact that the path to the true ending kinda falls apart in the end, you will experience one of the most unique and interesting open world games out there.

Wish more open world games took the STALKER approach instead of the Ubisoft one...",1685753894,1685793380,True,42,0,0.79451221227645874,0,True,False,False

When it comes to the story, I tried reading through the journal my character kept and read through some of the main quest text. I think if someone takes the time to read through the story, even if he isn't reading every tid bit, there should be enough to give him a good understanding of what's happening, but I feel like I only understood maybe 50%, the ending just felt like it came out of nowhere and answered nothing except one question. Not ideal in my opinion. The questing and storytelling is quite awful, even when it comes to tracking quests.

The gunplay is quite unpleasant. Early on the guns you are given miss the target unless you are very close, and it seems unless you hit the head you might as well be shooting at the sky. The enemy AI also just feels like they were programmed to slowly move towards you. There's also a lot more action than I would have liked. This game felt like 80% shooting enemies with it's horribly unpleasant gunplay.

The money system & inventory management weren't well thought out. It feels like unless you make it an active effort to avoid items your inventory will always be full, and so it became my second job to make sure I don't pick up too much. There's also enough money and items to never need to use the ingame store system. It could have been removed and it would not have worked to the detriment of the game. Right now it's there to make new players think the store serves purpose, when it doesn't.

The atmosphere & world didn't blow me away. The npc's felt irrelevant and boring, and the game has infinite enemy respawns all around. Sometimes scripted events kill the npc's you're supposed to talk to before you can even get there, even if you're running nonstop, and it's weird to walk past the same location just to see the same event you cleared unfolding again. It's also a lot more linear than I thought, it's so linear people shouldn't be calling it open world. The open area is very small and follows roads with some small areas to the sides, and late game I felt like I was holding W in a straight line for 3-5 hours.

I could talk about how I don't like various aspects of the game, but I'll leave it here. This game is probably my greatest disappointment in a while, as I don't think it does anything well. That said, I know a lot of people enjoy it so maybe give it a try if you see it on sale.

Also the game is a bit longer than my playtime, I apparently accidentally skipped a part of it.",1685583757,1685699187,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played it when it came out in 2007, and recently played it again with the Autumn Aurora mod (mainly for graphical improvements).  Somehow, I appreciate it today even more than I did when it was released.  How many games can anyone say that about, 16 years after release?  I honestly can't think of another game I enjoy more today than I did when it was fresh and new.

It does need to be said that this game doesn't have some of the quality of life features we expect from games today...but somehow, that doesn't really bother me with this game.  This game doesn't hold your hand; other than a few map markers and some dialogue, it's up to you to figure stuff out--but that learning process is also part of the appeal.  The map is big, and there is no fast travel--but it's so immersive and there's so much random stuff that happens along the way that I'm not really bothered by the extra travel time.  Autosave is sparse, at best, so you need to ""save early and often"" to keep your progress when you die--but the game's combat and environmental hazards are fair enough that if you're careful, and save now and then, it isn't a problem.  

The game's combat can be unforgiving, especially in the beginning, but it's unforgiving in a pretty fair way--meaning that if you avoid tough enemies until you're ready, keep track of your ammo, and use sensible strategy, you'll come out ahead more than you don't.  The player's character feels about as tough as the enemies who have comparable gear, so if you see someone who has better weapons and armor than you, that should inform you of your odds against that opponent unless you somehow secure an advantage. 
 Speaking of advantages, there are several factions that you can play off against each other, if you're clever about it.

The exploration and sense of wonder and discovery in this game are awesome.  Finding strange anomalies, rare artifacts, and hidden caches are all extremely rewarding.  If you help a wounded character, they might tell you to look in a certain tree stump in the woods for a hidden cache of supplies.  If you figure out a way around some dangerous anomalies, you might find a powerful artifact that somehow ""makes sense"" in the context of where you found it.  If you put in the extra effort to do side quests, you'll learn important things about the world you wouldn't otherwise be able to discover.  It really feels like every character, and every inch of ground is part of the world, and offering a mystery to solve.

Finally, one of the most interesting things about this series is the setting--a fictionalized version of the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that melted down in 1986.  This game (like the books it came from) asks the question, ""What would the world be like if nuclear radiation had slightly magical properties?""  The world the creators built around that premise is truly remarkable.

If you're a fan of story-rich FPS or RPG games, chances are, you'll love this, despite its age.  Buy it, install a mod or two, and immerse yourself in an intriguing world.",1685002879,1685002879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is also notoriously unstable and buggy and the performance is very inconsistent, especially on modern hardware. I've played through the game 10 times and it didn't crash once, but I've seen people (with very similar hardware) experiencing all kinds of technical issues from low framerates to CTDs every 2 minutes.

It sounds weird, but the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise almost ""chooses"" you and your PC, not the other way around.

The gameplay is also pretty different from most FPS games. The game almost teaches you to avoid unnecessary combat encounters. In most games, you want to gun down everything in sight to get the most loot and most XP, but in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you simply cannot do that, because your supplies are very limited and you usually don't know if the loot gained from the enemies will outweigh the ammo and medical supplies you use up in the process of unaliving them. Enemies are also really spongy, especially better equiped ones, like army soldiers or stalkers in Exoskeletons. so good aim and headshots are pretty much a requirement, if you don't want to spend a whole AK mag on every single one.

Most of the starter guns are also not very accurate, which is done to make the player feel weaker in combat and teach him that above mentioned survival aspect, I guess? Contrary to popular belief, crouching or switching fire-modes doesn't do a damn thing, you'll just have to push through until you get some better gear. If you want a post-apocalyptic game, where all the guns are as accurate as laser beams, go play the Metro franchise, you won't find much of that here.

Graphics are actually somewhat good for a 16 year-old game, but animations for guns and NPCs look really dated. All of the guns are left handed, despite being held by a right handed player, it doesn't have any real meaning or impact on anything, it's just a trend from the late 2000s, because animators wanted to show off a bit.

The OST is really good and positively contributes to the overall feel and atmosphere of the game. Speaking of the atmosphere, it's honestly hard as nails. It really makes you feel like you're stranded in this unforgiving and irradiated hellhole, and some of the underground sections are honestly more frightening than half of the modern ""horror"" games. The creepy looking mutants heavily contribute to this horror aspect, this game is not nicknamed ""Heart attack simulator"" for no reason.

As for modding the game...

DO NOT MOD IT UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED IT VANILLA AT LEAST ONCE. Seriously, mods interfere with the core gameplay and they either make the game super easy or super difficult. The only mod I'd recommend for a first-time player is the Zone Reclamation Project (ZRP), because it doesn't change any of the core features, and it's really just a community made bug fix/patch.

Overall, I'd say it's an 8/10, but this score is probably very biased, because it's one of my childhood favorites. You'll either love it, or hate it, there is no in between.",1684405921,1684405921,True,26,0,0.707153022289276123,0,True,False,False

The last 3 hours or so of the main campaign though, not very fun.

It comes as a surprise because up until the ending, as long as you're looting a lot and doing side quests, the game is actually kind of easy.  I wouldn't call the last few missions hard, as much as they are really frustrating and made me race to the end of the game.

As I started completing missions, the game feels very much like Fallout. However, the shooting reminded me of the old Tom Clancy games: pretty slow, heavy amounts of cover shooting (thanks to the lean mechanic), and very reliant on burst or single fire. Combining the two makes it pretty enjoyable. However, since this game doesn't do much in the way of explaining the plot and its mechanics, I pretty much ran around and explored these tiny towns and doing whatever quests I had access too.

Unfortunately, the quests have their issues too. When it comes to fetch quests, you have a limited time to find X and bring it back to your questgiver. The items do not drop often or can be tricky to find, so expect to fail the quest at least once, or get lucky and find what item you need prior to accepting the quest. There was one mission where you can bring back this weapon a soldier of the Duty faction left around, but if you were like me and completed a certain part of the story before accepting the mission, the waypoint leading to this mysterious weapon breaks. This is because the person currently using the weapon is now wandering around this massive map, which was frustrating at first, but then I accepted that I'm probably not going to find it.

Speaking of the map, I ADORE it. Every place has NPCs that are neutral towards you, enemies rocking white stripes on black sweats yelling ""CHEEKY BREEKY IV DAMKE"", and mutated wildlife that really fits with the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of Ukraine. The environmental storytelling is plentiful, the faction bases feel lived in, and the weapons are punchy.

I ended up getting the ""greedy"" ending, which according to the wiki is very common to get for first time players. I honestly didn't even know that this was the final mission and was playing through it like a gauntlet, where you have enemies wielding very powerful weapons like the gauss rifle (they WILL one shot you), rocket launchers (YOU WILL DIE A LOT, QUICKSAVE), and silenced rifles (THEY WILL NOT APPEAR ON YOUR MINIMAP, STAY VIGILANT). After quicksaving and quickloading a lot, it was a great time. This game will punish you for not being patient, and then will further punish you if you are too patient. For a game with combat that is pretty slow paced, it sure knows how to put you into a frenzy.

All in all, I'm kind of unsatisfied with the ending I've gotten, but now I have acquired the knowledge I need to get better endings. I will be doing another playthrough in the near future, but in the 26 hours it has taken me to beat this game, there were no dull moments (except wandering back to turn in quests because no fast travel, but its a feature!). If you are looking for something set in a post-apocalyptic hellscape with factions to deal with and have already played more well known games like Fallout, I highly recommend you give this game a shot, definitely worth your cash.",1684201731,1684201731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This entry is my personal favorite in the series though Stalker: Call of Pripyat is probably the most polished without mods. Story and atmosphere wise, this game takes #1 in the series. I would often just sit beside the campfire with the random NPCs you come across and listen to them playing guitar. The mutant designs, especially the Snorks and blood suckers, are iconic and very memorable. The gameplay is a bit jarring at first if you aren't used to these games as the guns aren't fully accurate. It's something you get used to with time and I would recommend you play this game on master difficulty. It's the hardest difficulty so enemies can kill you extremely fast but, they die just as fast. On master difficulty, one well placed headshot will take almost every enemy out.

After 11 years of owning this game and it sitting in my library,  I finally decided to sit down and play all the games before S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 releases (and before I actually try to play the Anomaly mod pack, as intended by the devs). And after all this time & attempts at getting into it... I finally get it. This is absolutely one of the best Survival FPS games ever created.
 
It does what the 3D fallout games do but better (gameplay, story, environments, music, characters/factions). I'd say the main difference is that the world feels so lively compared to Fallout. It feels like the world continues without you when you're done playing but thats where those comparisons end. Mostly because I wouldn't call it ""Post-Apocalyptic"" as the world as we know it outside of the Zone exists still (spoiler alert, Chernobyl exists IRL! Wow!). There are no real perk/RPG elements to the game besides stats for your character, either. If you want to get technical - the artifacts you collect can be considered perks in a sense, but they really only enhance stats but have a lot of tradeoffs. 

The atmosphere of this game is literally unmatched, the closest I have felt to this recently is Tarkov. Which unsurprisingly, after playing this game it made me realize that Tarkov takes a lot of mechanics from this game. That isn't meant to be a negative either, in fact playing Tarkov beforehand made this game much easier for me. 

I am going to assume if you're reading the reviews/interested you already know how this game plays. And instead of talking indepth about it and and sounding like a wiki - I'd like to share some tips:

The vanilla experience like many fans say is fine and should not need gameplay mods on your first playthrough, honestly, 
I don't think graphical mods are really needed either. However I would STRONGLY suggest you install ZRP. It includes some QoL features and bug fixes, I only really suggest this because the game can and after a certain point WILL crash on you, the ZRP mod fixes those issues for the most part. 

Find things feel weird and awkward (ex 'X' being the run key, whatever the hell the weapon fire mode button is, crouching) Rebind. Your. Keys. ESPECIALLY SAVE/LOAD! I would suggest binding load further away from the save key. 

Speaking of saving, I highly suggest saving before any possible encounter or level switch. Later in the game, saving before level switches will save you time if you get the occasional loading crash. If using ZRP you can press ESC and press S it will create a lvl named save. 
--
(The rest are up to personal preference but this is how I enjoyed the game)
Use whatever difficulty you want. I've read many arguments about this before playing the game and came to the conclusion it doesn't matter that much and chose master anyway because I enjoy dying over and over in video games.

Turn off the crosshair. At range you will ADS/Use a scope and CQC you will probably be point firing anyway. It gets in the way and kinda takes away from the immersion, the hud is fine.

Rebinds I did were: Sprint as Shift, Crouch as C, Low Crouch as Ctrl, and fire mode as B. Save game as F5 and Load on Num *

Equipment load matters. Carry like 300 bullets for your guns and 15x bandages and antidotes, 3-4x medkits of each and maybe 5x of 2 sets of grenades. Carry guns of different bullet types as well, you'll find that newer weapons will have a low amount of ammo starting out so keep a backup. 

I didn't do this but figured it'd be helpful: If you would like to not be shot at later in the game when backtracking to a certain area - stay neutral (loner) and try not to fight the factions. Bad shit happens in one or two areas if you turn on a certain side.

I cant list everything here, and I've only completed 2 of the multiple endings. But the community has way more tips/fixes/workarounds if you encounter any other issues/questions on the forums/subreddit/internet/google.com.

One of the standout features of the game is its setting. The game is set in an alternate reality where a second nuclear disaster has occurred at Chernobyl, resulting in a deadly and mysterious Zone that is full of danger and intrigue. The game's world is immersive and well-crafted, with a sense of mystery and danger that permeates every aspect of the game.

The gameplay in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is both challenging and rewarding. The game features a complex RPG system that allows players to customize their character and weapons in a variety of ways. The game also features a dynamic weather system that affects gameplay, as well as a day and night cycle that impacts enemy behavior and other aspects of the game.

While the game's setting and gameplay are great, there are some issues that hold the game back. The game's graphics, while impressive for its time, have not aged well and can be a bit jarring for modern gamers. Additionally, the game's AI can be frustrating at times, with enemies sometimes behaving in unrealistic ways.

Despite its flaws, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is still a fantastic game that offers a unique and engaging experience. The game's setting, gameplay, and atmosphere are all top-notch, and the game is well worth playing for fans of the post-apocalyptic and first-person shooter genres.

Good game from Ukrainian developers. Has a lot of nostalgia value for me personally.

Not that I grew up in the Chornobyl exclusion zone, rather in a post-soviet country. Gameplay itself is solid and the story is serviceable. Has multiple endings and some replay value.

For people like me who like realism, games like Kingdom Come Deliverance and STALKER games are a must play.
PROS
->very interesting story (honestly better than expected)
->endings are so well thought out 
->atmosphere
->enemy AI is fucking incredible for 2007 honestly (the way enemies move while in combat, many modern games have joke AI compared to this)
->the world
->guns (even though pistols are almost uselles)
->this game is hardcore, so gunfights are thrilling

CONS
->bugs where enemies clip through walls and can shoot you
->side quests are really not good, mostly shitty fetch quests
->some quests are not well polished (like when you need to get rid of Duty company, but I already killed them before, so quest couldnt progress)

DISHONORABLE MENTION: weapons can be really innacurate, which can be really frustrating, expecally VDM2 sniper, which was dissapointment

An Absolute Classic

The gunplay is dognuts and the general gameplay is just loveable jank. Highly recommend you get any sort of mod that makes it vanilla+ just so that the rooty tooty shooty bits are slightly more fun than frustrating ( playing this on Master which is the recommended diffculty already makes it so that everyone drops like flies, except the players accuracy is shit. so the mods usually mitigate that)

What ties this finest of Jank together is the really fun and generally intruiging story and world mixed with seemingly helpless gameplay where you're almost always one wrong step from getting turned into just shoes, either by anomalies or enemy fire. 

The atmosphere of the game cannot be praised enough, they've nailed the dying and rotten look of the Chernobyl exclusion zone mixed in with abandoned soviet labs, experiments gone wrong and frankly the bizzare but somehow-it-works body horror aspect of some enemies and places. The game looks fairly beliveable and completely fiction at the same time.

The atmosphere is arguably its biggest strength, the way some NPCs gather around a fireplace and sing is a really nice touch in contrast to the depressing vibe of the game, the way the world interacts in its system beyond player's input is genius.

However it's so unsatisfying to play. I keep coming back to this year after year now, only wishing it would click with me this one time but it never did. The side missions are almost always repetitive with killing this monster/NPC, etc without any emotional payoff with the quest giver. The map is brimming with atmosphere but most of them are empty. The inventory management is utterly not user-friendly and confusing for first time player. The worst of all is the shooting mechanic.

The game wanted to immerse you in this somewhat realistic take on what happens on the zone; everything is dangerous but the way the game makes this experience is to cheat the shooting mechanic itself. The gun is inconsistent. I shot an enemy's head 3 times with a shotgun who stand only 2 meters from me and they still live even though he didn't wear any helmet. This is made worse that every couple shots in, the enemy staggers and I suspect that they can't take any damage at all except for headshot damage in that entire stagger animation. I wasted a whole clip of handgun without doing any damage. Not only that, the gun accuracy is abysmal. The iron sight only ever increases the accuracy ever so slightly. You can aim enemy's head 3 meters away from you, lock it in and it still will miss 70% of time. It's turned into a guessing game of RNG and what OP weapons you can equip. The fact that they tied the accuracy to game difficulty is really baffling and the game never said anything about the accuracy either, you have to go meta and google search to get that info.

The enemy respawning is also a questionable design choice. It would be better if enemy respawns when half a day or a full day has passed but I encounter enemy respawn in only 5 minutes. I was shooting 3 military men and after the last one died, suddenly 7 spawned in behind me running towards me. 

Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl is too ambitious for its own good and fall so off due to its poor executions of its mechanics. It feels really bad to play and the bugs don't help it either. The bugs are at the point that I don't really know if this is intentional or not, if I should be laughing at it or annoyed by it. 

Even after all this, I am curious on Stalker 2, I really hope they nail the shooting mechanic, the mission designs and characters.

The atmosphere was really immersive, the audio and weapon functionalities and disabilities (jams, accuracy, etc.) are advanced for the time the game was developed.
It is not a fair comparison if we put a recent game with way more info and better UI, by the way I have not installed any mods, and the UI is imo the most hard thing to handle with.
The fact that there are no auto saves catch me on surprise when I died and had to restart a huge part of the game again.
I`m not very patient and sometimes I would skip some chat texts. Maybe that was the reason why I didn`t knew that I was going for my last mission on the game, so maybe a friendly tip without spoiling is getting the patience to read your PDA intel and what NPCs have to say.
When I ended the game I searched on the Internet, looks like there are at least 6 ending variations, which is a good thing if you want to replay the game.

It does look and feel quite dated, even with mods, but the gameplay is strong enough to overshadow that fact. The plotline is deceptively linear, with side quests and factions introduced to create a somewhat open-world experience. There’s a much weaker emphasis on survival than I initially thought there would be and a prominent sci-fi element. I was expecting more of a suspenseful survival sandbox type game, kinda like Tarkov or DayZ but singleplayer. Y’know, something with a little less story. I know it’s treasonous to say, but I really did get strong Fallout vibes as I got later into the game.

If I had paid like $5 I might have played longer too see if there was a worthwhile story there and some decent action.

* Traveling was mind numbingly tedious.  On the map you could spot your objective only a couple KM away only to have a barb wire fence in your way which is inexplicably able to stop a man with a bazooka, grenades, and a Rambo knife that just finished taking down an army of undead.

* Why on God's green earth isn't there a function to right click and place a custom marker on the map?

* Even though you chose a different quest the arrow still points in the direction it wants you to go.

* ""Return for the reward"" and there's no one there.

* The different levels without showing the road maps of the levels you're not currently on is just silly and very annoying for no reason.

I sincerely hope they refined the above in the next 2 games along with the upcoming release because they're a thorn in the side of an otherwise great game.

The gun play does feel foreign and almost bad at the beginning which is what really makes it difficult to get used to. They do this to make the later guns feel more impactful and powerful. The best tip i can give is always aim for the head. Its usually a 1 shot kill. Because of the way you have to play this game it makes you play more tactical and gets you more engrossed into the world. That is what is amazing about this game, how deep and connected you feel with the world and the factions. Always on alert, paying attention to your surroundings. The ending kind of looses the feeling you get all the way up to the red forest. After that the guns you get are good enough to beat the game with and all you do is fight a crap ton of enemies. I did not even return back to the traders to sell items or restock. Even with this gripe it is still an amazing game and holds up to this day. Also i did not use any mods. if you do and it is your first playthrough i would only download ones that patch bugs and do not alter the game, at least for the first playthrough. my intention is the beat clear sky and call of pripyat, then play the gamma mod. id give it a 8.5/10. i cant wait to play the next games and this series will probably go down as one of my top",1675657601,1675657601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the first games I got for my first PC build because I've heard good things, and with the sale at the time, thought it be fun to try. Boy was I blown away. This game holds up very well for its age, I can already see myself spending more time in it then some of the games I got that released in the last year or two.

 If you're a fan of the 3D Fallout games, and enjoy apocalyptic settings I could not recommend this to you enough. Even with the dated graphics and mechanics I found myself easily immersed in this world. I am excited to get myself through these games before S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 comes out. I would also recommend this to any FPS enthusiast, especially since its age means most should be able to run it on whatever they have.

You die constantly, the guns suck, the ai can see you from across the map and the graphics look a bit dated at some points, but for some reason it just works. You are vulnerable but so is the ai making gunfights quick if you are able to outsmart the enemys and flank them. The guns while bad at points can work and will if you use them properly and not as if its a call of duty game. The textures and models while dated can work really well because of the lighting in this game makes a game that was released in 2008 look like a game that came out in 2018.

The game is, put simply, dull but that is completely by design. It creates this moody and incredibly eerie atmosphere which immerses you into this post-apocalyptic world where almost everything wants to kill you. 

Going into the game almost completely blind, the story didn't grip me straight away, but the atmospheric design, lore and game-play did. At first, I found it hard, frustratingly so. However, after I tweaked some of my settings and adjusted to the A.I, I started to understand how this game wanted to be played. 

Running around spraying at all the enemies will only get you killed and will deplete your resources fast; Meds and ammo are sparse so use them sparingly. Also, use your environment to your advantage and peak around every corner. At heart, this game is just an FPS Survival with RPG elements and the game-play loop is very simple. However, the way it is designed forces you to fight-smart, making you think strategically and take extra-safe precautions.  

Even after all that being said, staying alive can be hard for the average player which can be quite off-putting to new comers. Although, I can re-assure you that the there is a quick save feature and, from experience, I'd recommend you use it frequently.",1674688108,1674688108,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,1,True,False,False

Shadow Of Chernobyl, or S.O.C. for short, is a masterpiece of a game I first completed not too long ago, in august of 2022. I played the game with the STALKER Complete 2009 mod, which I was hesitant to use at first as I usually used S.O.C. All In One Patch by ""BalaclavaBandit"" credit to him for making my first time playing the game so enjoyable. But after installing the mod, I was still hesitant to play the game with that mod installed for a reason you may find funny; I didn't say I liked the way it changed Strelok's gloves and how they didn't change with the suit. Still, mainly the fact that it looked like Strelok was wearing a black trenchcoat and black leather gloves, which just seemed too edgy for his character and his established lore, but I kept going. The next thing that made me hesitant about using the mod was the excessive amount of artifacts everywhere, especially in the garbage.

Another thing the mod did was overhaul the graphics, but I could barely notice it. Supposedly it also changed the weather, but I only really encountered that the sky was cloudy a lot more commonly. I carried all this hesitation throughout the game, but it was too late by the time of the barrier zone, which I reached a week after I started because I also had responsibilities and couldn't just finish the game in one sitting. I also got the true ending on my first playthrough, but I had to look it up after clearing the powerplant and getting to the coded door without the code breaker. Let's talk about the C.N.P.P. for a minute. It is one of the worst levels in gaming, rivaled by god knows what and is annoying to an extreme. If you have yet to learn what it is like to run through the outside train yard before you meet the monolith with two medkits! I repeat, two medkits!

Then you are a lucky soul, unlike me, who, instead of preparing for my first time at the C.N.P.P., just went straight through Pripyat after turning off the radar. This level could be better, unlike the rest of the game; although by default, the base game is buggy and glitchy, you can quickly fix that with mods. I have already spoiled a lot by mentioning the barrier, code breaker, coded door, C.N.P.P., and radar, but I will spoil it no further. But that ending is such a twist. This vital information gave me a better understanding of the game's lore. Too bad I can't talk about it. But other than the C.N.P.P., it's a great game and truly depicts what a game should be, giving the player a feeling that they have an impact while also making the enemies feel just as powerful and impactful. The atmosphere is top-notch, and the gameplay is fun but sometimes tiring. Overall, 9/10.",1674674268,1674677574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The firefights are intense and there is a strong sense in the beginning that you are expendable flesh just like every moving creature in the Zone. I only have 4 hours and I'm already addicted. If you want to survive and get superior weaponry, you're gonna have to play smart, patient, and you're going to have to pay attention to your surroundings. This game doesn't really hand you anything besides quest instructions, a pistol, a knife, and a pager. 

Do yourself a favor and play it on Master difficulty. You can't run around and quickscope everyone, you're going to have to play cover and maneuver through the AI, which is fairly decent for a game that's over a decade old. They definitely don't just run at you to die in the meat grinder. Your enemies will move in groups. If they spot a dead body, their first response will be to back up and let their friends know there's a dead dude on the floor. 

(Mild gameplay loop spoilers ahead) 
Guns are wildly inaccurate. While at first I found this frustrating, I figured out that pistols aren't very effective beyond 10m. You'll want to find a rifle (which I found in like the first three hours). Even then, I'm still hurting for a long rifle.

I remember watching a trailer in the early 2000s (before HL 2 & Doom 3) showcasing bullet ballistics among other cool stuff. Faithful material penetration and trajectory deformation depending on caliber fired, weapon reload animations, sounds... Was the most impressive thing I've seen as far as realism goes. Dream come true for everyone who fantasized about a proper shooter. When it released I was one of the lucky ones capable of running it in all its glory.

Today its cult status holds as if no time has passed, much like the place where story takes place - in Chernobyl exclusion zone, 20 years after the first incident. It was right the 2nd one that caused it all... Can't tell more without spoiling it as story in one of the better parts although the full reveal comes only near the very end.
For the most part you'll be competing quests for rewards to earn enough to afford better gear. Once set you'll venture outside the Rookie Village, closer to Zone's center and closer to mystery surrounding your recent past. Besides the main quest there are few unique side-quests for added flavor and many generic repeatable ones which rarely pay off.

A lot has been said about the atmosphere and rightfully so. One of the appeals is there are no heroes here, just ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances, seeking riches found only in the Zone. Primarily rare Artifacts, head sized otherworldly objects that provide passive stat bonuses when worn on belt and also selling for hefty prices. They're found around various anomalies, hazardous localized areas damaging anyone coming close and fatal to those pushing their luck.
To me most of the atmosphere comes from highly unique visual setting. What Far Cry/Crysis was for foliage that is Stalker for concrete. It is so well done it looks better than even the recent Stalker 2 triler. Texture parallax mapping is of just right detail density to look good from up close and afar. Concrete, brick, steel and wood are just so well weathered it just feels right. Devs spared no expense at adding extra details where others would simply duplicate assets to fill space. If there was an opportunity to make rebar stick out and bend a certain but different way than one next to it they done it. Same applies to literary everything: collapsing rooftops/beams, window frames, half destroyed walls, broken ceramic covers, placement of props and damage it suffered, all done with extreme attention to detail and contributes to immersion unlike anywhere else. And there's lots to explore - dozen or so maps about half square kilometers in size connected via loading gates and filled with buildings in various stages of decay.

AI is so good and disciplined in combat it'll make you rage like you're the bottom feeder in online matches. Thankfully they can't use grenades that would be too much. Their accuracy is just a flat chance based on distance so staying afar greatly increases your odds. What they lack in lethality they sure make up in survivability however.

Performance is impressive considering one major shortcoming it shares with another game released in the same year: Crysis. It runs on a single CPU core and despite source being available no one managed to bypass this bottleneck. That said slowdowns only come from script execution when AI comes 'online' in 150m circle around the player. When you see high quality shadows from a railing high up in the tower being cast everywhere by a guard's headlamp at night you won't believe how cool it looks and smooth it runs. I sure couldn't... must have played too many Unity games lately.

Last thing game does amazing is projectile ballistics (spread is a whole different ballgame). Speed, air resistance, penetration and ricochets feel realistic (except wind immunity), especially when you see a tracer bouncing of a helmet but its occupant dropping cold on the ground. A person would assume gunplay is out of this world, but...

* * *

Of many weapons there are every one is affected by bizarre design decision of having a random arbitrary bullet spread. To illustrate, ideal scenario of being still, low stance, iron sights, pristine weapon, first shoot: 1m cone shaped spread over just 30 meters. Yep Slavs in their infinite wisdom never fail to disappoint. I should know I'm one of them... Gunplay as a result is total rubbish until mid/late game when you find a rifle devs decided it should have a lower spread. You'll only miss 50% from then on.
But it gets worse, much worse, the so called [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/8b6u4q]Magic Bullet[/url] mechanic. After the initial shot an invisible 1 second timer starts before the next fired shoot will do same amount of damage, any sooner and it'll do only 20%. Effectively turning automatic weapons you worked so hard to get into children toys. Add to that bullets fired from sidearms disappear after 50m, and even less for Shooties.

Stealth is broken even though 2 out of first 3 missions encourage it. Once spotted (or reload within ~20m of nearest enemy) everyone on the map knows exactly where you are and is aiming at you. If bullets can penetrate whatever cover you deemed safe when you saved, time to say goodbye.
Sound is broken. Direction is fine I suppose but distance doesn't matter. Had a pack of wild dogs bark in my ear only to realize they're far away when I turned. Eventually you get used to that an start ignoring stuff not directly in front. Custom OpenAL driver couldn't fix it either. Listening to ""Hello, Hello"" coming from inside a hermetically sealed reinforced concrete bunker over and over again from 200m away became a global MEME long ago.

Until relatively recent beta patch game was melting hardware because ordinary V-Sync still wasn't functional. Some time ago devs released a statement how they indeed weren't set out to brick your PCs because of that. No bug komrad, merely an anomaly.

Gunplay alone is enough to bury the game for me but I ain't done yet. Game was in development hell for a long time and amount of bugs on release day would shame even Bethesda. Today is not much better in terms of official patches. Full list is quite long and serious, including show stoppers, but thankfully there is a cure for most of them. The answer is [b]Zone Reclamation Project[/b], community bug-fixing project set out to preserve full vanilla gameplay, with addition of a Modifier program allowing for tweaking over 100 different things (including non-vanilla QoL) using a friendly GUI. Just know it's not trivial to set up, took me 2 weeks of research (ZRP and everything else) before even setting foot in the Zone.

* * *

Even with the amazing ZRP it's a hard pass from me. Way too clunky even after fully set up to one tastes. Exploration looses appeal as soon as you realize there's not that many pre-placed goodies and those that are just aren't worth it. Every single hidden stash is empty until you read a dead man's PDA pointing to it, when it magically gets few items placed inside, almost always useless.
Annoying things still present: enemies can still spawn on top of you, running is interrupted if there's even a slight change in ground elevation (wait till you encounter stairs lol), interaction between stash and inventory becomes a nightmare with many objects, distant battles cluttering the world with unrecoverable items, PDA map always centering on some distant unrelated place, shallow global AI (A-Life) - living world outside your 150m circle for all intents and purposes does not exist.

No idea how I managed to finish it relatively unscathed 16 years ago the first time but it got me into MODs finally, just to get rid of many dumb design decisions (forced quest with low time limits, low carry capacity, no gear repairs, etc). Wish to play CS and CoP for the first time and had to dive in SoC once again for the full experience. From what I read that ride should be a lot smoother but at the expense of storytelling.

Certainly yes during sales :) 

As a game it will suck you in and make you enjoy playing it without even thinking about finishing it.
It will fill your brain with alternative priorities than pushing it to its end ... but there is the catch ... the end will catch you with your guard down, not expecting it to end that sharply! 

It makes you as a game, believe that it will last for twice as much but it won't be far before you realize you are watching the final cinematic ( i won't spoil here )

I am not going to say anything about graphics etc as this is a 2007 title and instead of focusing on that you should better focus on some revolutionary ideas it brought to the gaming industry and the fact that a nowadays copycat is one of the most played game atm (It won't be long before you realize which is that) ;)

[h1]To put it bluntly, this is probably one of the best PC-ONLY game I have ever played.[/h1]

[h1]STALKER[/h1]
[b]Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers, and Robbers.[/b]

One of the most atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, this game is close to perfection. Even on modern times, this game still holds out pretty good while back in 2007, it required top tech to run it properly.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Unique, atmospheric, immersive, open-ended first-person survival gameplay (more atmospheric than Metro 2033 franchise espcially for the open-ended/non-linear gameplay). 
+Amazing virtual world is like being at Chernobyl, especially on the DYNAMIC day/night rotation.
+Fantastic and creepy ambient music! Gotta love the guitar rest areas too!
+Excellent blend of action, horror, and exploration.
+Large variety of options, armours, gadgets and weapons.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Game was filled with bugs and for a long time until it got thouroughly patched by now.
-Story is a bit incoherent (a bit hard to follow up... read STALKER WIKIA once you beat the game)
-Even at novice level, Combat and AI can often be too challenging.
-Glitched A.I. at times.[/b]


[h1]OVERALL & RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]F.U.K.C.I.N.G. GOOD GAME! Especially now that the bugs got ironed out, you HAVE to play this game! While at it, go ahead and play the rest of the STALKER series, CLEAR SKIES and CALL OF PRIPYAT. [/b]

I've played for a few hours on vanilla now- I have also played about 5 with mods and neither of them are fun, modded was more fun, but I can't find a mod that makes the gunplay feel more modern without making my health essentially 1 hit point's worth making gunfights too long and drawn out. I went in with expectations of a tactical (but dated) shooter with RPG elements, but within the first 2 hours I was just blazing through gunfights as if it was the latter half of half-life 1 and my inventory was stocked with meds so I would essentially never die and then after that it got really boring. I tried Radiophobia which made it really fun for a bit, felt a lot like a single-player tarkov, but then gunfights got way too hard, even on the lowest difficulty I would peak an angle and get killed from 30 meters before the enemy is even on screen, 1 bullet removing 80% of my health and the concussion effects making it hell to even look at the screen

Overall for me vanilla is TOO dated and modern mods are TOO overtuned, I cant find a sweetspot in the middle, it's either too easy or too assblastingly realistic, I want to play the game in full, but with supposedly 10-15 more hours of that im good

4500,130834396,76561198031640491,0,5,4190,0,1608,1675109306,"I’m not typically an FPS player, so the style of SoC is something pretty new to me.  But with Stalker 2 on the horizon, I took the Christmas deal to pick up all three original games for less than a tenner to see whether the upcoming release might be something that would appeal to me.  The jury is definitely still out on that.

SoC has a fantastic brooding atmosphere which fits perfectly with the environment and story.  It keeps reminding you that you’re in a very unique place, where nothing should be taken for granted.  For a game of its age, personally I think the graphics have aged pretty well:  It’s certainly more attractive graphically that something like Fallout 3.

For me though, the gameplay itself is a complete let down, with too many features being poorly implemented.

Let’s start with the zone itself.  It might look like a huge open-world space, but it isn’t. It’s a series of connected ‘regions’, and transitioning between them can only happen at specific entry/exit points.  Sometimes passing through these points will actually teleport you huge distances within the overall zone map.  Immersion goes out the window.

Dotted all over the map are personal stashes from which to steal, anomalies to collect for financial gain, dead NPC to pickpocket.  You can horde endless amounts of goodies because the game is literally putting them there for you.  Except there’s a problem – there is nothing you can do to increase your carry capacity.  In no time you’re overweight and can barely move.  Of course, there’s a simple answer to that.  Just stop looting. Before long the shimmering glow of an anomaly is something you just start ignoring.  You simply don’t have the capacity to collect them and cart them back to a trader.  Kill a gang of bandits and it’s not worth looting their bodies because you’re already over capacity.  SoC is not a looter shooter, but can’t stop itself from giving you things to loot.

As I said I’m to really an FPS player, so I can’t speak for how well gunplay is implemented (by other people’s accounts, not very well).  All I can say on the point is that when you have a gang of five NPCs closing in on you and you empty an entire magazine into one of them and they still don’t drop, you have to wonder whether the balance is a bit off.  I believe this has something to do with the difficulty level of the game – the lower the difficulty level the harder you are to kill; but by the same straw the more difficult it is to kill the enemy.  To my mind that would mean that the odds of you winning a battle are the same regardless of the difficulty level – the only variable here is how much ammo you have to use up in the process.

It has been noted by others that NPC have an unfair ability to detect you.  The game strongly hints towards the use of stealth, but this is somewhat redundant if the enemy is always able to detect you.  One situation I personally encountered was a gang of bandits who were able to detect me through a train wagon while I was crouching and had been completely immobile for at least 30 seconds.

Questing is another area in SoC that has been poorly implemented in my opinion.  Conversing with many NPCs may lead to them giving you a fairly mundane quest – “go get thing from location and bring it back”.  But too frequently those quests might be impossible to achieve, especially given that they have a one-day expiration date.   The map tells me the weapon should be here, the quest’s wiki page tells me, “yeah, there’s a good chance the weapon will have been moved. Don’t take the quest unless you’ve already found weapon”.  More significant quest lines can be gotten from traders.  These are usually more detailed and have far more steps, but still the map-markers and descriptions can be vague, and the level design means that there’s only one way in and one way out.  In the first of the Agroprom missions I had collected what I was there for but rather than moving on to the get-out-of-there step, the map was telling me to go to a different location on the same site.  When I finally got to that point, after wasting more ammo and med kits, there was literally no reason for me to go there, and the quest marker moved on to telling me to leave the site.

A third type of quest appears quite repetitively when you pass through some of those region transition points.  Through the PDA one of the traders will ask you to kill all the bandits in this region. Because stealth doesn’t work you’re going to have to kill them anyway before you can move on, so making a quest of it seems somewhat pointless.  Once they are all dead you’ll get a reward from the trader - but only if you travel all the way to the trader to hand the quest in.  Why can the trader give me a quest remotely, but still need me to go back to him for my reward?  This just leads to so much back and forth that eventually you just kill the bandits for free in order to pursue your objective rather than the trader’s.

One irritation I want to touch on is the strange drone fly-over scenes that happen occasionally when moving through a region.  They are supposed to give you a birds-eye view of the area you are entering so that you can get an idea of the layout and what’s already going on when you arrive.  But they happen at only one entry point even if there are multiple ways to get into that area, so if you take the wrong route, you won’t see it but will still end up in the middle of the battle.  What’s more they happen every time you pass that entry point, no matter how many times you’ve passed through before, and while the fly-over is happening your character is stuck and vulnerable to attack.  My character genuinely died of a mutant attack while one of these fly-overs was happening (for the fifth time).

My final major gripe with SoC is the non-existence of any character progression.  My PDA tells me how many points I’ve earned from kills, and they in turn transport me up the zone ranking.  But what does my character actually gain from that?  From what I can tell – nothing.  My character will only ever get better in the game if I as the player get better at playing it.  As the main story progresses, and he ventures deeper and deeper, my character is no better equipped for what lies ahead than he was at the start of the game.  He may have a more powerful gun, but his ammo capacity hasn’t increased; he may have accrued a vast wealth from trading, but that won’t help him against the all-seeing AI.  As a bad or mediocre player, I can never hope to reach the end of this game, because there is nothing that I can do to give my character fighting chance.  I just need to become better.  And I don’t like that.

I have only started this game once and after about 30 hours am nowhere near its conclusion, but I just don’t feel like I want to go any further.  I can’t tell whether it’s because I’m just a useless player, or that the game just doesn’t want me to play it.  The zone is not supposed to be an inviting place, but I wonder whether the development team pushed their unwelcome a bit too hard.   I am interested in finding an end to the story, but would rather watch a playthrough on YouTube than persevere on my own.

The AI was janky at best and the shooting felt off. I couldn't tell if it was an accuracy issue or if the guns just didn't feel strong enough. Started looking through reviews and finally got to a few that basically said guns don't do much damage outside of headshots and there's very little indication that you actually hit the target. So my shots were likely landing, I just couldnt tell that they were. I could only tell when they would actually flinch from a shot, which they wouldn't always do. There are mods to fix these issues I just didn't feel the game did enough for me to invest the time to implement them. Atmosphere felt cool and the story may be interesting but if the core gameplay doesn't work properly then there's no real point in trying to play it 

You shouldn't have to mod a game to make it playable, this might be an amazing game with those mods but you still shouldn't have to implement them in the first place. I do wish that Steam had a middle of the road review option because I'm mostly writing this so people know what they may be getting into when buying this. I didn't see enough in what I played that warrants taking the time to mod. Just wanted to give a bit of a heads up

But there around 30 hrs of campaign here, I recommend playing the first one,Not as semi open world as the later games, More linear, less guns, and equipment, And models are only bit better than Morrowind from ES series.
Its still somewhat immersive though i must admit, Still had Alot fun playing it.
Its strange design choice, Ak74 with ak47 mag, (The ridged lines indicting thats the iconic ak47 mag type1-3) gas mask are based on real soviet designs, and sunrise and other stalker suits are based on real spec ops NBC suits with olive green or olive drab, or black for the mercs.
The age of game shows when buildings are just placeholders, with most of the city being inaccessible. meaning urban combat is more like street combat.
In modern day and age, i think if you dont have patience for call of duty 3 tier graphics or mechanical jankiness, I would skip the title, People who have played super polished FPS's this so many backsteps, This may inspired Tarkov, Day z,ATOM RPG, Wolfs law anarchy ,Deadside, stay out,will to live,scum, h1z1 and even metro series. and many more. Its culturally amd historically important as FPS game as its was first of fps apocalyptic games prior to fallout 3, its often referee
d to as soviet fallout but its terribly dated and was only big hype pre 2010. Its picking up speed again due to upcoming release of stalker 2. 

Not going to Line, bottom line, if you are looking for a more polished Expreince. Try metro redux series or Stalker anomaly thats a mod that combines all 3 games as Orginal stalker games are a classic, but they are as dated as morrowind or original balders gate

SPOILER WARNING
I finished the game by approaching the wish-maker with ~120,000 rubles, which is not enough to buy a suit of armour that i was saving up for before I realised I was about to finish the game, which got me the 'Greed' ending, where my generous, helpful, and well prepared stalker suddenly decides all they want is to be rich, which promptly gets them killed. I realise the game also wants you to find and kill someone from your past who you can't remember, but I thought that helping the people of the zone was more important, so I pursued that instead. I would have been fine with a choice given to me about the failed wish, but to have my character decide without me they want nothing but to be rich left a sour taste in my mouth.

Set in 2006 in Ukraine, near the area where the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded in the 1980s, you find yourself in a deadly and ruthless exclusion zone after a mysterious new accident. Battle mutants, other scavengers (stalkers), and the radiation to hunt valuables and strange artifacts. 

Heavy FPS. There is no character creation, but there is inventory management.

If you liked Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas, but wanted something a little more difficult, this game is for you.  You might even rage quit, like I did after about 6 hours (it says 4 hours on record, not sure why). But still, good game I plan to pick up again.

It is amazing what the developers are doing for Ukraine, raising money for the displaced and spreading awareness. Thank you.

Genuinely feels like SoC set the stage for games like Fallout New Vegas with it’s non linear story telling and character interactions. Sure the story is nothing ground breaking but provides a perfect enough pretext to set out and explore the zone setting in motion an addicting gameplay loop: finding new loot, meeting new characters, discovering rare artifacts, etc… A solid game through-and-through, but I’d be lying if I said it was perfect. I had two MAJOR issues with this one that caused an otherwise amazing game to feel incredibly unpleasant to play at times:

- The amount of backtracking is atrocious. I swear half my play time was spent running between point A and point B to complete missions (endurance artifacts are ESSENTIAL, for sake of your sanity). Having the option to fast travel to and from missions upon starting and completing them in Call of Pripyat was a welcome inclusion.

- The final act is pretty bad, especially when compared to the rest of the game. It suddenly becomes a generic FPS game and throws everything else that made the game so great out the window. Ubering your way through waves of Monolith soldiers goes against every core philosophy this game had been perfectly setting up up until this point. Out with a simmer, not a bang.

Regardless of it’s faults, Stalker SoC has quickly become an all time personal favorite of mine. A one of a kind game!",1673154481,1673155074,True,0,0,0.474683523178100586,0,True,False,False

What followed was probably one of the best experiences I've had in gaming. Ever.

While start is slow and can be a bit confusing as to what the hell is going on, it remains enjoyable, and the further you get into the story, the more this game shines. Roughly about 10 hours in is where the story and gameplay truly starts to shine. The ending, while feeling quite abrupt, is fitting, and quite a different end than most games in the genre.

The gun play can, at times, feel weak (with certain guns not feeling weighted properly and gunfights in tight areas often making enemies feel much spongier than they probably are) and this can (and does) become quite frustrating right at the beginning and right near the end of the game. But where it does shine is in more open areas medium distance between you and the enemies, and most of the late game guns I encountered were incredibly fun to use in these settings and felt good to shoot with.

I definitely recommend this game to anyone who's interested (and if you're looking through the reviews for this game, you probably are). I would however recommend you download the ZRP mod with it, as the base game is quite buggy.

1. Install ZRP mod for a more stable experience (never got any crashes)
2. Headshots are always a one-hit kill. Be patient and don't spray-and-pray. Wait between shots if you can, and use cover.

Also, if you get motion sickness from this game like I did, I recommend 3 things, though it still took a couple of sessions for me to get used to it.
1. Disable head bobbing via ZRP mod's Modifier.exe
2. Install another mod to increase FOV to something like 90

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC. The game that popularized again bcs of recent ""War"". This game is very famous around my Junior High School years. Now when this game on Summersale 2022, i decided to buy 3 of them lol. Ofc tried the first game of the list according to release dates.

Update: I've Finished the game with 2 Ending, The Infinite Dark ending and Rich Ending (Which is the stupidest ending??).


[h1] PROS : [/h1]
- This game is fun, Finally I realised why I get bored quickly in nowadays game, This game aged like fine wine, good story, good gameplay, good 
- [strike]The survival mechanics doesn't involve eat or drink[/strike]You can get hungry somehow but food is scarce to found if you dont diligently kill everyone and trading. But food can help you regenerate healths while not wasting the instant heal like Med-kit/Bandages
- The game is simple, not too overcrowded mechanics that ruin the survival and shoot-out flows.
- The Graphics of character models maybe dated, but the environment really felt real especially compared from the last game I played. Fallout 4
- The animations maybe dated, but the AI of enemies react really good. Even surprising most times they can figure out how to flank me in many different ways. They hiding, they flanking, they confuse you to trick where to shoot them. It's challenging and fun.
- The story itself is pretty straightforward and involves a-lot of reading. And no choices so far impacting anything. So if you find side jobs if you need cash you should do it.[strike] There's no moral penalty[/strike]. There is a moral penalty, you can avoid kill anyone aside bandits and keep finishing quest that don't involve killing innocent people and keep NPC from death. But once death, you need to reload. Don't wander too far since they often died out of sights. [strike]You can just accept or refuse, that's it.[/strike] There is a choice but only about the ending. You can find it on internet lol. It only matters of what you do at the end.

[h1] CONS : [/h1]
- Map UI and how to pinpoint locations and find which one is main quest, side quest, etc. really annoying they don't look different at all. Maybe I've spoiled by modern games mini-maps features as this game is 2007.
- [strike]It's hard to shoot accurate from long range if we don't have any feature to mods weapons with scopes or iron sights.[/strike] There is a mod like silencer, scopes but it only apply to certain weapons, and so far it for mid-low tier weapons only. But also, this game is really simple and we can concern to other aspects.
- The enemies eat bullets like sponge, especially in later game. Idk, its really hard to get headshot and approaching them is hard enoguh with radiations everywhere.
- The enemies outfit models looks to similar to each other, confusing me is that the same guy I've been shooting still alive or is there dozens more?
- If the game approach [strike]nigh time[/strike] Dawn/Evening. Its really hard to see any enemies but they can see us clearly somehow without flashlights.
- [strike]I'm still early in game, so I've yet to find out any base that give us any other abilities to sell or trade. Even buying better gears.[/strike] So far I only found 3 sellers, The First guy on Bunker, The Bar with cool music, and The Lab professor in middle of zombie infested nowhere. Running back with heavy loads sometimes infuriating, except you want to drag corpses each time, somehow you can drag them no matter how heavy their gears are lol.
- And the most annoying is if you forgot to save somewhere, when you die you get aaaaaaalll way back. I kept forget this game doesn't have any auto-save features. And when you save at bad spot or timing, wish you have 2 separate saves or this is it. You need to start from beginning again.
- OFTEN SAVE, you can get stuck in certain buildings and only way out is reloading last save.

Well theres other 2 games and [strike]I've still far from finishing SoC[/strike], I heard they improved half of what i've complained here. But if this game deserve the classics title as people said? Idk, so far it's a good game [strike]but I still yet see. Maybe updating the game after finishing it later[/strike]. Recommended",1656073880,1672690948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not sure why its so overhyped by people, but I can't find anything fun, while playing this title.

Its recommended you use an overhaul mod to fix the broken npcs and weapons. on the upside, its pretty easy to install the fixes, there are several good guides right here on steam for it. However, even with these, there are still moments that are really frustrating. there are instakill traps in some areas, even in tight spaces like underground tunnels, and while you are fighting enemies. The human characters are honestly all pretty broken. For starters, they don't make sounds when they walk or move, so you will never have any idea how many or where anyone is unless you see them. this with the fact they like to hide in the dark corners in pretty frustrating. this wouldn't be so bad, but the game doesn't have autosaves, so dying unexpectedly without a quicksave can happen pretty often and is very annoying. even the friendly npcs are frustrating sometimes, they will block your path, especially on stairways, and once I was even softlocked because I was in the corner that an npc was trying to move into, so he just ran into me in the corner forever and blocked me from moving at all, forcing me to reload a save.

The open world is actually really cool, its made up of several levels that are separated by loading zones, and because they're not that big, it feels like a full open world, while still being small enough that travel even across the whole map doesn't take that long. each level is also pretty dense with things to do, and since looting dead enemies will often reveal locations of stashes, you have good reasons to revisit areas and find new little spots in the levels you already looked through. the game also has a system where npcs will move around the zone on their own, so it really feels alive, and like each level is always changing every time you go back. Even camps and areas will change npcs, maybe it will have bandits, or mutants, or mutants AND bandits, or maybe friendly stalkers took it over, and you can sell some stuff to lighten your pack.

All in all, i do recommend it. I'm writing this around half way through, so I don't know how it ends out, but i've had a great time despite it all.",1672613364,1672613364,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game immerses you in a complete world, with many side quests and a very interesting main plot. If you take the time to read the notes and talk to the NPCs you will learn a lot about the world and your character.

There is a lot of armor and weapons in the game, which can be modified with accessories such as sights or grenade launchers, the loot system is very pleasant thanks to the many caches scattered on the map.

The game features different factions of NPCs, each with their own story and a large bestiary. The AI is quite good and makes every fight enjoyable.

The game is quite old and has a lot of bugs, so it is recommended to save regularly in order not to break the progress of the game.

In conclusion, if you like post-apo, this game is a must, you can find the trilogy for a very cheap price and it will bring you in a unique universe that no other game can offer.

I've heard many good things about it so it seemed like a good game to try out.

I have to admit, the game whilst nothing groundbreaking these days, did provide quite a few hours of entertainment.
Despite it being 15 years old, Stalker:SoC has held up very well and the mod community helps it even more.
Speaking of mods: INSTALL ZRP BEFORE YOU START PLAYING. It will not effect the story at all and will fix some annoying bugs.

With that out of the way, the good:
*Decent gameplay mechanics that overall don't really get in the way of the game (though they aren't particularly ""different"" either, but let's remember this is a 15 year old game)
*The graphics, whilst scuffed occasionally still hold up really well even in the modern day and fir the aesthetic of the world created by the story.
*Compatibility - despite the game being 15 years old, the compatibility seems to be perfectly fine even with moderns systems. The more time goes by, the more I understand that this is not a given.
*The atmosphere is great and fits really well the theme of the game. Despite this being an old game, the devs clearly utilised what they had at the time well, whether its sounds scape, the look of the world and fleshed out the game world nicely.
*Good community and mods. If you want to expand on the experience in the Stalker: SoC experience, there are a few large mods that were made by the community that you could try out (like Autumn Aurora)

The bad:
*The voice acting is a bit all over the place. This game probabnly was primarily meant to be played in Russian, but then ported to English. This shows everywhere with signs being in Russian, some NPC chatter being in Russian, even some of the main mission dialogue you can hear is also in Russian. This wouldn't be as big of an issue if the game actually had subtitles, however it does not. There apparently is a mod that would add them but there is a possible incompatibility with the ZRP modpack so be warned.
The dialogue of some characters also has no variability and they just repeat the same thing over and over every time you walk close to them. This initially is just something you notice but the more you hear it, the more irritating it gets.
*Bugs - there are quite a few that seem to have been ignored by the developers at the time, some of which I cant imagine they werent aware of. This can be mitigated by using ZRP though.

Overall, I perfectly understand why this game has received the praise it has. By todays standards maybe this game is nothing amazing, but for its time I imagine it was quite the feat that the developers managed.
Its not a game you can't miss, but seeing how cheap it is by default (and you can get it for even less on sale) I think this is an easy game to pick up and try out!",1672274605,1672274973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I walked into this game knowing only that i should install a mod, for the game to run better (this did not give me high hopes). And now that I am done and recommending this game let me say ""you should play the game"". The graphics may be outdated as hell but let me tell you I had fun the hole way through this game. I wish i did more in my first play through, that my main advice with the game do as many side quest and exploring as you like cause before you no it you'll be lost to the zone.

What I Don't like 
- Graphics: This game is old and you can tell sometimes it's hard to tell the difference from an enemy to terrain 30 feet in front of you.
- Gun play: I'm very mixed about the dun play I like it's style but I hate that every gun is not accurate at rages exceeding 50 feet. some guns do no damage even to enemies that had the gun you just picked up.

Recommendations 
- go into the game blind 
- install a mod that helps the game not crash I like Reclamation project myself but any that are recommended should be good (mods are not needed but highly advised)
- Don't try to beat the game quickly: you can finish this game in 12 hours if you really try so I advise you grind gear, find good guns, and do any side quest that seem interesting cause many of the main side quest will send you down a rabbit hole of locations and NPC's

Weapon accuracy, inventory management, weapon accuracy, stamina, weapon accuracy, your weapon has jammed, weapon accuracy, game crashed, weapon accuracy, this fricking map hud is annoying and finally weapon accuracy.

Now, granted, it doesn't take too long for you to figure all of that out, but oh, boy, good luck until you get there. And If you read up online, trying to understand how weapon accuracy works as an example, you'll see that you're obviously not the only one bothered by this, but not only that, people who have GENUINELY tried to argue that this weapon innacuracy bs is a bit much, get bombarded by elitist douchebags saying that it's a skill issue. No, it isn't a fricking skill issue you moron, it's just bad, annoying and frustrating. ESPECIALLY near the end of the game.

Watched a video by snipper on YT playing this game and it's exactly the style of games I like to play. Unfortunately, this game doesn't work at all, at least for me. 
The shooting is very bad, I can't tell if the weapons are just bad or the shots aren't actually hitting the AI or what exactly the problem is, but some enemies I shot over 16 rounds into with the starting pistol and nothing was happening. Other weapons also would take excessive rounds of ammunition to take down.
The radiation is really confusing to me. In fact, a lot of the HUD is generally confusing and there's no tutorial on what exactly all these readings and buttons and sounds are for. Numbers pop up and go away, beeping goes off and disappears, radiation comes seemingly from no wear and suddenly you're dying. There's also these translucent stationary floating orbs that pulse around the map and if you run into them, they pulse and deal damage. This is an interesting feature that I actually like but sometimes they don't appear at all and you can just hit one after another of these invisible explosions until you're bleeding out and you die.
The missions are REAL janky. The map has a mind of its own sometimes and it's difficult to navigate with the mouse controls. My objective also kept jumping around and even had the first objective and second objective active at the same time and wouldn't allow me to progress. When I finally did progress, I was dealt a lot of damage in game trying to figure out a way around the progression block and used up all my med-kits. Coincidentally, when I got to the next progression point, the objective was to give a guy a med-kit. Which I didn't have!! So I had to advance past my objective killing enemies and searching bodies in future mission points until I found a med-kit. At that point, I magically got radiation poisoning and died because I couldn't use the med-kit, I had to give it away! Which brings me to the last issue...
Lastly, and most importantly, I don't know if this is a feature or it's just broken but every time I died, I had to go all the way back to mission one. Full restart. Which makes no sense with an autosave feature. It prompts me to restart from last save, and full restarts me. I figured maybe it doesn't actually load from the autosave if you die so I tried going back to where I was and manually saved the game. When I died, I still started all the way back at the beginning of the game. So I tried manually loading the game from my last manual save but it loaded the game at the start of the first mission in the beginning of the game! So like I said, some games are like that, but if it has a save feature it shouldn't force restart you at the beginning.
Really wish I didn't spend $12 buying all three of these games just to find out I'm never going to play any of them. Unless some big changes take place, I will not be playing this. I really wish this wasn't the case because it has a lot of potential and what I did play had it's moments and watching other people play looked really exciting. But this is currently garbage as a download and play game. If it was free, I probably wouldn't have even written this but I spent money and it doesn't work so there you go.

The single player feels more alive than some MMORPGs with NPCs constantly talking, fighting, singing, complaining, laughing. Yes, they say the same thing over and over most of the time, but it still feels live. Rival factions fighting each other, NPCs vs monsters, monsters and unfortunate stalkers vs anomalies, all that adds to the overall disturbing ambiance.

[b] Playtime - 9.8 hours [/b]

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b] 6/10, 6/10
[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b] 9.5/10
[b] Soundtrack: [/b] 7/10
[b] Graphics: [/b] 6/10 
[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b] 8/10, 7/10

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b]
The plot of this game has enough to keep you enticed at the beginning by providing your character reasonable motivation as to why they do what they do. However, the plot doesn't really effect the character throughout the game and remains flat. It was serviceable but nothing great in reality. Dialogue isn't anything to write home about. Better than average, but not great.

[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]
The setting of this game is where it earns its worth. The game feels so depressing and hopeless, which is what we should be expecting from it. You feel as if you are in this world and you are experiencing it yourself. While it has mostly a dull color scheme, it's appropriate for where the game is set. They really hit it out of the park here.

[b] Soundtrack:  [/b]
The lack of a soundtrack is to Stalker's benefit. This is not meant to be some sort of action film, it is a depressing tale that is meant to immerse you in the world. The only music present in this game is the main menu music (which is amazing at setting the tone), as well the music that appears throughout the game by people playing the guitar or over the radio.

[b] Graphics: [/b]
It was made 15 years ago. The graphics aren't great but they are serviceable. 

[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b]
The gameplay is very brutal in this game. Guns are inaccurate, enemies later in the game are tanky, you can lose your health fast. You have to play this very methodically and have great resource management. It is tough and unforgiving, but it is enjoyable in the end. Some times there were bullshit deaths I will admit, but that's part of the game. PLEASE REMEMBER TO SAVE FREQUENTLY. AUTO SAVE IS BAD IN THIS GAME.

Sound design is wacky at some points, but good for most of the game. 

[b] Final Notes: [/b]
If you are interested in a more depressing and moody version of Fallout, this is right up your alley. It's usually on sale for $5 bucks and for that price, it's worth it for everyone. Play it and enjoy the world of Stalker. SAVE FREQUENTLY.",1670443210,1670443210,True,0,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

I will briefly mention what i love about the game then i will explain all the issues this game has in order to provide said warning label.

This game has a cult following and somewhat of a pedigree. The buggy nature of the game mixed with some interesting story and setting along with great atmosphere and weird slavic shenanigans make this a one of a kind experience, especially since nothing has come out since the last game quite like it. Yes i adore the Metro series but that series has a better story, its more focused and linear and provides better atmosphere imho, while on the other hand this series is more focused on the setting and is more like an RPG with a focus not on levels of the character but guns, armor and artifacts. So it's a more technical RPG. That is unique. Add to that an abundance of mods that provide such an experience that will give you hours and hours of replayability and challenge (think Escape from Tarkov but singleplayer).

Now for the negative aspects of the game but only Vanilla (no Mods):
As mentioned the game has A LOT of bugs. Game breaks easilly, enemies shoot at you without looking at you, reloading a save sometimes doesn't reset enemy knowledge of your location, getting spotted a mile away, they shoot you trought walls, objective markers dont dissapear, voices repeating same lines over and over again, enemies don't flinch, instadeath, clones spawn in a single spot, enemies spawn and aim at walls or at the sky until you shoot at them, they shoot at you even if there is no way they can see you..... the list goes on.

Whatever everyone is saying, NO the weapons don't deal more damage on higher difficulties towards enemies. The first weapons are inaccurate so that makes you think you are shooting blanks while you are actually missing shots. Headshots usually kill in one shot, but for some reason not always (armored enemies or just glitches). 

Most quests are fetch and kill quests and don't bother doing them unless you really want to. Most of the resources (and money) are easy to come by during the later half of the game. The progression is natural from bad weapons to not knowing which one to carry since there are a lot of good ones suddenly.

The bad part of the game is the way you traverse around the map while collecting stuff and completing missions only to have to walk back the entire way just to complete it for the reward. Along the way most enemies respawn or raids occur so because of the way the semi-open world is structured you will have linear corridors you have to pass and they are almost always garded at some point by either mutants, dogs, bandits or zombified enemies.

The game shines during the middle segment but falls flat when nearing the end (last 3 missions). It becomes very linear and you have a point of no return that the game doesn't mention but some characters do in some sort of way if you pay attention. The problem is that you have to be well prepaired to even have the possibility of succeding. These last missions are VERY poorly designed and ruin what the first half of the game established. The game doesn't have a combat focus at all, that is the reason everything is so innacurate and wonky. Then the game decides to throw 30+ enemies in a single building at you just at the end of a mission... and then there is almost a constant wave of enemies until the end of the game. You will HAVE TO kill most of them to be able to pass alive. They will instakill you around corners, nade you while in cover, snipe you with a gauss rifle from a building far out of normal range (for a normal chance to hit them because of the bad accuracy) or RPG you from across the map. The enemy placement is really really bad during the last bit of the game. SAVE OFTEN and plan ahead. F6 is your best friend!

The last bad thing is the story kind of. Yes the atmosphere is good but ruined during the last bit of the game cause of the abominable combat. Same goes for the story. But it also suffers from bad explanation. You have 0 developed characters other than the main character somewhat - the guy you are playing as. So any plot twist is not really surprising. There are 7 endings 5 of which are ""fake"" endings and 2 are ""true"" (1 of which is cannon ofc, like in Metro). The 5 fake ones are not that big of a deal and make no sense until you see the requirements to get all 5. The other 2 endings are a lot better but their explanation is really bad. I understand the concept cause I read about it more but for most people it will be confusing and won't give you much fulfillment (No catharsis).


With all that said I do really like the game. Just make sure to remember this is a unique game with a lot of problems and a lot of good things. The mod support is astonishing and after trying the base game mods should be on your list to install if you found the game to be interesting but could use a bit of tweaking.",1670084998,1670084998,True,41,0,0.803687572479248047,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere and setting is as amazing now as it was back then, but I sort of wish I had actually modded the game this time around since there is a huge amount of flaws in the game so I recommend actually starting with a modded playthrough (especially if you have played it before as I had)

My main gripe is with the weapons and how accurate (or non accurate rather they are). It makes the weapons feel horrendous to handle and almost makes the game look like a parody at times. You can aim straight at someones head from a few meters away and still your bullets will fly all over the place. It does get better as you get better weapons but it still makes for a horrendous gameplay experience at many times that almost kills the game for me. It honestly feels like an RPG dice roll when you shoot someone and hope your bullet will go straight instead of just fly at an angle. I guess the ""RPG"" feeling of things being random and more stat based with bigger sense of progression of the weapons is the intention but for me it really hurt the experience a lot. You put your crosshair bullseye on someones head and then you have to pray for a good dice roll and a straight bullet every time you pull the trigger. 

For a good part of the game I actually thought the enemies where bullet sponges since straight headshoots did not seem to kill them (and I played on highest master diff), but it was only later that I really saw that the reason my headshots did not kill the enemies where that the actual bullets fly all over the place and are not straight. You often have to fire about 3-10 bullet straight at someones head if you are not in complete close quarters to be sure one lands a hit and kills the enemy. It makes for a horrible gameplay experience. 

I would rather have realistic accurate guns and then make things more difficult in other ways (not being able to just spam bandages and medkits and not being able to save whenever etc). I would assume these are things that mods fix. 

Another problem with the combat is that you often don't feel like there is any visual feedback as when you hit someone, sometimes the enemy react but more often you just feel like you are shooting a paperdoll until it falls over.

Also the sound effects are completely horrendous in many places (something I must think mods fix also)

Lastly enemies keep respawning in areas way too fast. Again making the grounded realistic feeling of game fall apart at times.

I really recommend the game for the setting and atmosphere, but do consider modding for the really bad/broken parts.",1669833521,1669833942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you look closely, you may find valuable artefacts. And between them, the space : various apocalyptic atmospheres await for you, either conveyed through immersive landscapes or compelling musics.

The game has a bad opening but if you can get past the first 30 ish minutes it becomes a tense shooter with great moments, some that were scary but not in a cheap way.

If anyone reads this here are some tips to get started.
1. Play on veteran or master difficulty- on easy mode all the enemies are bullet sponges but on hard they deal more/take more. Much better way to play plus you'll learn quickly why cover and ammo conservation matter.
2. the pistols in the beginning suck. take it slow until you get better weapons.
3. You dont need to take every gun or thing and sell it as money is not that hard to grind. 
4. Be smart about what you are carrying. You can store spare equipment in blue chests near traders ( of which there are few in the game) but try to be aware of how much you are carrying.
5.Flashlight is bound to ""L"", night vision ( once you get armor that has it) is set to ""N"". Change ammo type is set to ""Y"". There is also a keybind to change fire mode from semi auto to single shot, and also for some rifles from bullets to the attached grenade launcher.
6. There is no thirst mechanic but there is hunger- eat some food every day to be healthy. You can drink energy drinks to restore stamina though.
7. There is no way (even with console commands) to bring people back to life when dead. If they die, thats how life is in the zone.
8. Use F6 to quick save and F7 to quick load. Use this often. Also make occasional saves as the game can crash, seemingly randomly.
9. There are no 1 of a kind artifacts, but some are incredibly rare.
10. Explore the environment, there is a lot hiding for you to find.",1669231155,1669231155,True,142,0,0.904280900955200195,3,True,False,False

After watching said trailer, I quickly became obsessed with the game. I wanted to learn everything I could about it. I searched high and low across the internet for every bit of information I could uncover. Eventually I found the developers forums (GSC) and that became my second home while I awaited its release. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqQt-C6KB_8&list=PLAl2CYaVBm6BBV1PbLqoVTbqchC9tHiaz&index=15&t=67s 

I remember at the time I was playing Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, With it I fell in love with non-linear open world 1st/3rd person games with RPG elements and how much I could get immersed in virtual worlds. I am all for fantasy settings don't get me wrong, but there is nothing more terrifying than reality. (With a spin of fiction of course, alternate reality if you will) The abandoned urban/industrial locations in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. were more my cup of tea. That in itself made me very excited to play it. I couldn't wait to get lost in its world. 

While I waited though I researched about the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April 1986, it was mixed emotions for me. I was sad/amazed/intrigued. Sad for all of those people who lost their lives because of this. Nothing but respect for the liquidators and anyone involved in the initial cleanup. Those people are heroes and deserve nothing less. Amazed that this game had some real history in its background story. Even if it is incredibly embellished (mutants, anomalies, artifacts etc etc.), you have to admit it makes for an interesting premise to a story. Finally, Intrigued on what these game developers had in store for the players to experience, without making a mockery of those who had lost their lives in this tragedy. The game also borrows elements from ""Roadside Picnic"" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979  Andrei Tarkovsky film ""Stalker"". If you haven't heard or checked them out yet, they are most definitely worth it. Masterpieces in their own right.

Well turns out it was a long wait lol, game finally arrived in March 2007. It was no longer Oblivion Lost, it was now called Shadow of Chernobyl. Which was a welcomed change imo, what was not a welcomed change was the amount of content/features that were removed from the game. Vehicles, locations/maps made smaller and simpler, monsters/mutants, superior lighting from old alpha builds among many other things had been removed it was rather disappointing to say the least. The survival aspect of the game took a huge hit, leaving many in the community confused as to what happened during development. GSC Game World regardless of all the missing features still delivered a good game and it was well received by critics as well. 

The game at release had performance issues and bugs that required some official patches + plus community fixes. Once that happened it was clear that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl was a game ahead of its time. In a league all its own and a true gem in the PC gaming world. The atmosphere takes front row seat in this game it is almost like another character in the game. Such believable atmosphere it is downright amazing, it keeps you on the edge of your chair as you play. 

[u]Pros[/u]:
- Incredible atmosphere!
- Impressive use of lighting and shadows, 
- Cloud shadows that shift as day/night cycles progress. 
- None stylized (photo based) textures (realism), Replicating the rust and decay feel.
- Great cut-scenes that hold up even by today's standards. 
- Plenty of side quests 
- Exploring is encouraged to find secret stashes scattered throughout the world to find loot, weapons, ammo, suits and artifacts. Artifacts can be placed on your belt to grant the player abilities like resistance to radiation, increase weight limit etc. Some interesting combinations that can be made with the multitude of artifacts available in the game. 
- The games AI can be quite challenging because they adapt/react/flank/take cover depending on your approach. This adds to the games replayability immensely, if its one thing I have learned playing this game is that when it comes to killing the AI is that no playthrough is ever the same. Never. They are very unpredictable lets put it that way.
- Trading system with merchants and other friendly AI characters
- ""The Zone"" is alive even when you are not in the same vicinity, AI will be fighting mutants and/or other factions (Bandits, Duty, Freedom, Loners, Military, Mercs, Ecologists & Monolith) All fight among themselves.

Besides all the bells and whistles the story is incredibly engaging and keeps you interested throughout. Without too many spoilers (I am sure most people reading this have already played this but still) You play as ""Marked One"" an amnesiac trying to retrace his steps, he is then set on a mission to the heart of ""The Zone"" (term used to refer to the 30 kilometer Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, established after the accident.) to find a target and their whereabouts. Game also has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player, 7 in total.

[U]Cons[/U]:
- Lots of ""fetch"" side quests (Surprise? lol)
- AI that can sometimes see you from ""miles"" away (vanilla)
- Some quest giving characters can die. (vanilla)

Just a heads up. Nothing game breaking but worth noting. Just like all games, it's not perfect.

[B]Mods: (Updated 9/18/2022)[/B]

The modding scene for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is very much alive.

- ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) (community fixes keeps vanilla intact)[url=http://www.metacognix.com/files/stlkrsoc] ZRP[/url]

[u]ZRP[/u] goes perfect in a first playthrough to have the best bug-free experience with the game. Once your done with your first playthrough consider modding the game. Shadow of Chernobyl has some incredible mods worth installing. Especially, if you are looking for cut content like mutants & vehicles, a new storyline, better visuals (Texture packs, Reshade, ENBs etc), more weapons & attachments, new side quests, improved enemy AI, realistic weapon damage & accuracy, free roam & ironman modes, new areas to explore & all 3 games (Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky & Call of Pripyat) maps together in one & survival elements in the form of crafting, animated consumables, item repairing, cooking & base building. 

[u]Some of the mods I can recommend are:[/u]

[u][SoC Mods] [Classics][/u]
- Oblivion Lost
- Priboi Story
- L.U.R.K.
- OGSE (Old Good Stalker Evolution)
- AMK v1.4 
- ABC Inferno
- STALKER Soup
- Narodnaya Soljanka DMX 1.3.2 dkz02
- [b]Autumn Aurora 2 (Overall favorite SoC mod)[/b]

[u][Standalone] [Modern][/u]
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha DCE 
- Radiophobia 3
- Dead Air: Revolution 
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Anomaly (Monolith 64-bit engine + hundreds of addons)
- [b]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: G.A.M.M.A. (Curated Anomaly Modpack 329 addons)[/b]

The list goes on really, just my humble recommendations on the ones I have tried. 

Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat are awesome games as well, worth checking out at least once. They also have great mods which I will not mention in this review. Worth noting is that many of the improvements seen in modern day STALKER mods couldn't have been possible without these two games. But I will say that there is something about Shadow of Chernobyl's allure and atmosphere that didn't carry over as well to the other two games. Out of all three games, Shadow of Chernobyl is by far still my favorite.

I don't claim to know everything about these games, because honestly I don't. I still discover new things about them every time I play them and new mods coming out all the time. They are gifts that just keep on giving. Thank goodness for Eastern European game developers & the passionate modding community for keeping this game alive!",1442514086,1668266851,True,506,33,0.938917815685272217,31,True,False,False

It is an open world survival / shooter game with a somewhat linear story. Although there are choices here and there and factions you can join, you don't have much consequences like modern games only ending is different. Which reminds me to say Stalker is a 2007 game.
You kill mutants, loot mercs, military, whoever is dead, old buildings, abondoned places, gather artifacts, use or sell them to get strong. Get quests and jobs to uncover the mystery you are in and also to survive. There is no level up or stat/skill system, you get stronger by items. And there are tons of items. You have to eat and sleep regularly and avoid hazards, find safe places to sleep or cover from strange zone events. World is alive, mutants, factions, hold bases, fight against each other, patrol etc. Reminds me of Fallout 3/New Vegas. 

First of All , ***I've played Stalker OGSE 0.693 Patch 2.10 Revised Fix2***. So the whole experience is different and I believe much better. That's why my playtime shows different because Ogse uses completely different installation/folder. It's not hard to install and you don't need to install anything else. It improves gameplay, graphics, everything at once. With ogse you can use your 2-3 year old desktop GPU to full extent. It does not make the game modern but definitely makes it better. (Compare screenshots) Adds many weapons, items, full maps, lots of quests that left out etc. ***Highly suggested.*** 

+++ Setting : Chernobyl after incident becomes a mysterious zone, anomalies, mutants, military and factions trapped in or just want to benefit from it. You are a neutral stalker trying to figure out your memory loss and certain near death experience. You can make friends and enemies alongside factions but the Zone is the real enemy to everyone. (or is it?) 
Artifacts and anomalies are tied together, both a danger and also rewards you. You can get resistance to damage, faster healing etc from them. Finding and picking good artifact combinations is important. 
Zone  is almost always dangerous, scary, keeps you on your toes. There are some parts of the game that is right out of a horror movie. Music and ambient sounds are perfect. 

++Gameplay: With Ogse, there are tons of weapons, weapon modifications, ammunition types, repair , vehicle driving etc. Every weapon beside pistols are satisfying, bombs, rockets are deadly to anyone. There are some issues that respawns occur at map transitions sometimes and is annoying but nothing you won't handle. 

+Technical : With ogse I encountered very few crashes with win10 latest, rtx 3080 and i6900k. It is somewhat cpu bound and not so multi-core friendly which i think why i have lower than expected frames but since this is an old game and a very big mod that re-writes the game its OK. 

++Music: Some music choices of Pripyat, Freedom base is so good, I had to mention it. Even though I don't understand the language, they are quite good. As far as I know most of them OGSE additions. 

With all that said, if you like this kind of post apocalyptic settings this is a good game. I spent lots of hours without getting bored. Controllers are annoying though. And dogs.",1667765084,1667771979,True,1,0,0.505988001823425293,0,True,False,False

Combat is particularly lethal; emphasizing on tactics and accuracy more than anything as firefights can go both ways.

Atmosphere and environment: I could write a paragraph but I don't want to so I'm just gonna say its amazing.

Nitpicks: 
-Some times the audio can just assault your ears if you have headphones (Mainly the last mission)

Shadow of Chernobyl is a very enjoyable FPS game, with stellar atmosphere, an ominous soundtrack and variety of sounds that never quite become familiar whether you're a rookie in Cordon or an expert in the CNPP. I played the game with the Starter Pack 2019 modpack, and I gotta say, the game is incredible and ran about as good as a game this old is capable of given the engine GSC used. The modders on that pack squashed tons of bugs, basically anything game breaking you can consider gone, the only thing I noticed that was still an issue is a certain sniper wanting to dome a certain NPC you might wanna talk to about 60% through the story, but unlike vanilla, he at least can't shoot him until you've accepted the quest to kill said sniper. The graphics were updated but not taking away from the vanilla experience, as well, using Aurora mod I believe. The gunplay and difficulty on Master feels good, guys in armor are absolute tanks and given the modern plate carriers (and in this case an Exosuit) even one guy properly beefed up feels extremely lethal. The game really forces you into a cautious, methodical style of playing where you get used to the weight of your backpack, how far you can run in case of danger, sticking to darkness whenever possible, and always going for the head of anything man or mutant. Awareness and focus is required as the game doesn't hold your hand for anything and both the storyline and anything you want to do will involve agency on your part to a degree a lot of gamers might not like, but once I realized that I was actually king of my own decisions for once in a game it felt like a breath of fresh air. Wanna power through the storyline? Go right ahead, but I don't recommend it, although it has been done before. I really only did maybe 5 missions I didn't ""have to do"" for some rare artifacts and gear, most of my time was spent exploring the Zone and looting the many, many, many stashes in the world. That is where the real gear is, and as many times as you come up with arms full of junk you find something worth 50 junk stashes. I encourage anyone interested to give Shadow of Chernobyl a shot, as I always wanted to play this series and with the Starter Pack 2019 modpack it really is a wonderful experience, the gauntlet at the end is a real doozy, but just remember stalker, anything is possible in the Zone.",1667453647,1667453647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just shut up and give me a good game that isn't broken. The Trader also gives me missions that I then cannot complete because...I don't know why. ""Bring over the tail of the psuedodog."" Ok, so I go out and kill a dog and get the tail and bring to to the Trader and he doesn't acknowledge that I have it in my inventory. Why? I watched a lot of videos about this game and it always looked like something I would like, but no.

Update after 7 hours: Like most people, I returned to the game and I'm slowly making my way throught it. It's frustrating at times (often) but it's also rewarding and has great atmosphere.

Also, this is the jankiest game I've ever played. Some missions have the most random criteria for completion.

Every time I play this game I fluctuate between recommending and not recommending it. If you, like me, have wondered about this game for a long time, then give it a try. If you're just passing through, keep on strolling.

Final edit: I'm on the final level and I really cannot recommend this game to anyone. It is so bad. It's just bad. Every time I load a game now, all the enemies that I've already killed respawn, so they are behind me and kill me instantly. It's just a broken mess of a game. There's also just too many different kinds of ammo and too many different kinds of guns. Enemies that kill me from 100 feet away only have shotgun ammo on them and a shotgun when I loot them. For the player, shotguns are only viable when you're close enough to kiss an enemy. The atmosphere and some, only some, of the gunfights are great, but everything else is hopelessly bad.

I feel like a lot of the praise around the Beatles lies more on their influence than on the music on its own. It would obviously be foolish to ignore the historical significance that they have but at a certain point, it feels a bit misleading, especially when a lot of the reviews that praise albums emphasize how some of the songs are forgettable or even bad, before giving them a 10/10 score because it ""flows well"". I don't wish to look down on anyone's perspective and blindly call the band overrated but the urge is still there. Because it's easy to look at these reviews and say that some people are deluding themselves into liking something that has maybe aged badly, but that's really stupid. I think that it's more interesting to try to find out why people react like this. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is a Ukrainian horror fps from the 2000s. It's a game with a great atmosphere and an interesting story. It's also an extremely infuriating experience because of the great presence of bugs, crashes, and mistakes, and because of the honest to god awful combat. It's a piece of media that has evident, glaring, game-breaking flaws, but that people still hold in extremely high regard. People still consider it one of the best. Yet it feels wrong to call a game a masterpiece when there is so much wrong with it, it's contradictory. A funny example of this logic is that, when it was released, critics argued that the intense flaws of the game were purposeful. They apparently reflected in a deep metaphorical way the reality of Ukraine's history. I'm pretty sure that this was later disproven but it shows how people try to justify their immense appreciation for a certain thing. And when you run out of ways to describe your genuine love, you end up saying shit like: ""I like the vibes ig"". 

I think that it's a bit sad that people have the need to justify their subjective feelings for a subjective thing. Obviously, being able to defend your point of view in a reasonable way is important but some things are beyond that. Like why are apples better than pears, why is the last of us 2 better than the first one, why is S.T.A.L.K.E.R not worth playing, why is Sgt. Pepper's mid? There are points where these explanations, these feelings, transcend words. You like/hate a certain thing because you like/hate it, because it resonates with you in a unique way, because you experienced it at the right time at the right place, because it reminds you of something personal to you, or just because. I love S.T.A.L.K.E.R and I have no idea why, and even if I can't get behind the Sgt. Pepper's hype, I still respect it.",1667164556,1667164556,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

All this game has going for it is atmosphere and soundtrack, and, admittedly, those are fantastic. But everything else is indefensibly shit.

Let's start with the basics; yeah, this game is broken. I don't understand why these other reviews mention easy fixes online, when I've had to scour the internet for such basic issues as lowering the unbearable head bobbing and weapon balance. Of course, there are many large mods that fix all those problems, but they're effectively different games, and only a few actually let you play the original game's story, and those few force terrible graphic and music changes. 

But I digress. Even after fixing these options as much as I could, the game is still a boring, confused mess of fetch quests and terrible combat. Terrible, terrible combat in which you spend most of your time peaking behind walls and cinder blocks, shooting people 5 miles away from you who are just standing completely still at the side of a tree or in the middle of the field. After finally winning a battle by waiting by various corners for an enemy to show themselves, I didn't only not feel any satisfaction, I instead lost all my immersion because my amnesiac newbie stalker just slaughterer an entire fucking military compound and got away, too. So much for the dark, grim, alien world of the zone where even the best barely get by. 

And this stratagem of just peaking around a corner for half an hour isn't unwarrented, as it is the only strategy possible. Running straight at the enemy and trying to dodge around is a death sentence. Stealth is literally non-existent, so you can only hide in a building or a corner and shoot at foes when they get close. Where is the deep, stressful combat I've heard so much about? I enjoyed fallout 3's combat more than this. At least that game has a decent amount of different weapons, this game has 6 at the most when nearly every one is a thinly-veiled reskin of another. 

The AI is not terrible, not good, and certainly not fun. Sometimes it likes to sit behind cover for the majority of the fight, occasionaly silently moving to a different position across the battlefield and instantly blowing my head off with an ak47 from miles away because I decided to peak up and try to kill one of the other 10 bandits playing a DS behind a helicopter for the last 5 minutes. Occasionally enemies will stand in a field or move towards the player, either deleting you the second you step out of cover, or completely ignoring you. Needless to say, combat is not enjoyable in the slightest. I can't even be bothered to mention the incredible lack of enemy variety. Fighting mutants is actually fun, but they're so rare it's certainly not enough to counteract the vast, vast majority of enemies being shit. 

Story is cool. But the actual missions being such repetitive borefest fetch quests completelt destroys any hope of it carrying the game. You'll spend pretty most all your time walking around similar enviroments doing nothing, and the rest in the shit combat. There's more to write but I can't be asked, maybe I'll add more later

First third of the game had my attention and interest, second third I nearly dropped it just out of boredom of walking around everywhere, final third of the game I was in full sunk cost fallacy mode (So much combat oh my god the last three hours of the game is just shooting and shooting), ""I already put 15 hours in I guess I have to finish it"". It was an alright experience and it certainly had its moments but the game as a whole is a lot of just walking around an interesting landscape and world. Exploration is rarely* rewarded as stashes and hidden caches don't have loot in them unless you've found the coordinates to them on a body so that was a bit of a frustrating realization. Other than that the game's pretty buggy, had to play with a bunch of stability mods and even then it crashed fairly often, but it has aged quite well graphically, music and sfx are decent too, I can see why it's beloved by so many people but I guess I just ain't one of them. I'd say only grab it if you are going in pretty blind, if you knew anything about it going in or had high expectations like me you'll probably be disappointed.

I played through each of the games for the first time years after they were released. 'Shadow of Chernobyl' is still my favorite, it even warranted a 2nd playthrough from me, which I hardly do for any game. Usually once I ""beat"" a game, I feel like I got closure and I don't feel the need to revisit it any time soon. This game is so good, that my 2nd playthrough felt independently original to the 1st one. At certain moments, I may have remembered certain parts of the map or enemy spawn areas, outside of that it felt like a completely different experience. 

Truly a masterpiece, I know people love Call of Pripyat and Anamoly mods but personally I still feel like this is the best. This is my favorite S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience I've had. I did wish on my 2nd playthrough that there was gun modding or repairing, as in Call of Pripyat or mods. However, part of me still enjoys that I had to meticulously plan out and physically move guns and ammo. In preparation for when guns ran out of durability in certain fights or areas. The guns become decreasingly inaccurate as the durability wears down. 

For example, saving a full durability sniper and rounds for an important fight feels extra rewarding to me. As compared to just being able to repair any gun at will. If you enjoy 'story' driven shooters, this game is cream of the crop in my opinion. Especially if you're into post-apocalyptic settings and exclusion zones. If you end up enjoying it then there is at least 1 worthwhile playthrough of 'Clear Sky' and 'Call of Pripyat' as well. They are all three distinctly different in their own ways, this one still being my favorite.",1666476831,1666477464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The scavenging aspect is a lot different to other open fps games most people are familiar with so you can't go into every situation guns blazing or you'll end up dead or with minimal resources. I would recommend playing on master as this only heightens the damage you give and take but doesn't change the AI in any noticeable way.

However, there are bugs and it can sometimes crash on modern machines unfortunately so I would recommend using something like the zone reclamation project or complete mod for a smoother experience as either of them can iron out the common issues and crashes.

As such, you may want to take everything I say with a grain of salt, though 95% of my experience should've still been the same as a vanilla player. This review will also mainly be comparing it against it's fellow games in the series instead of overall.

Many people claim that Shadow of Chernobyl, despite being the first in the series, is still the best of the main trilogy. While it is certainly worth playing if only for the story alone, I must say that I don't see it. This entry has some very notable strengths over the others, but overall? It definitely has aged the worst in my opinion.

Strengths -
Freedom (not the faction): This game definitely treats you as if you were a total newcomer to the zone, learning about it more and more as you progress, and starting with absolutely horrendous equipment that you will need to replace ASAP if you wish to not struggle against even dogs and bandits. To enhance this effect, (and make it even more challenging) it gives you very little guidance, but also very little restrictions. From the start of the game, you can effectively go anywhere you want, and for better or worse, you can even ignore the entire story, with the game reacting appropriately if you do. This is very different from the other two games, where you both start with somewhat decent equipment, an obvious main goal, and a clear cut path of progression.

Better storytelling: Kinda going with the above point, this story definitely has a stronger mystery bent than the other 2 games, and I really like the breadcrumb trail you are given as you go through the game and get closer to your objective. You really have a lot of side objectives you can do to understand more about who you are and what you're doing, or barrel on ahead regardless of consequences.

Honestly... That's basically all I can think of that it has other it's brothers.

Weaknesses -
Worst gameplay in general: In the base game, there is a lot of stuff lacking that the other games in the series innovated with. Without mods, there is no way to repair your guns or armor (aside from a glitch that only affects armor) making EVERYTHING in the game on borrowed time. That unique gun or armor you just found? There will come a time that you simply cannot use it anymore. Weapon and armor mods are also not present, so it's not like you can even really get attached to your equipment that much anyway, so I guess that helps with the aforementioned problem I guess? Artifacts are just kinda laying there on the ground for you to pick up, or rolling on the ground. No detectors or anything needed, and they don't respawn, so their is a finite number to be found at any time. On the other hand, I guess I like the way artifacts affect you when worn in this game, with it not just being a binary ""wear this good artifact with this rad-reducer one for a flat buff.""

AI is dumber: AI is not that impressive in this game compared to it's sequels. Both NPC and mutant patrols rarely actually wander anywhere, and they remain static far more in this game, and it got to the point where I could literally predict the spawns in certain areas after visiting them enough times. (Fun fact, every time you enter Agroprom, a blind dog pack will ALWAYS spawn in the railway tunnel and usually attack the nearby stalker camp, no matter how long it's been since you last went there)

Factions are basically non-existent: There is no way to meaningfully join or side with any of the factions in this game, and for that matter, bandits, military, and mercs are always hostile to you, with no other characterization. The only real ""choice"" to be made in regards to factions I can remember was helping or destroying Skull's squad, and this basically either kills Freedom entirely or just removes a single squad from the game respectively. Obviously for your own enjoyment you can help Dutyers and kill Freedomers or vice versa if you wish, but there is no real reason to do this, as there is no progression or ranks to work towards, and no one will acknowledge your actions, even should you completely wipe out their hated enemies. And because squads will almost never move from their positions, these two giant factions more or less become static monoliths in their given locations. Apparently via a borderline glitch via sequence breaking you can ""join"" freedom specifically, but it's obvious the game was not planned around it.

Fairly Weak Mid-Late Game: The game get's a little droll after the early game, mainly because there is only like 3 meaningful traders and quest givers in the ENTIRE game:
Sidorovich, who you basically ignore after the early game because he is so far away from the main maps. (and there is no fast travel in this game without mods)
Barkeep, who will likely be your main trader and questgiver for the majority of the game due to his centralized location, large quest selection, and good stock as you progress through the game.
Professor Sakharov, who basically only deals in science stuff and therefore is the most situational of the bunch.
Unfortunately there is little else to works towards outside of this and the story, because artifact hunting is not really something you have to build and plan for due to the way they are found in this game, hunting mutants is really only useful when it comes to doing missions for Sakharov, and the game in general becomes a brutal gauntlet against Mercs and Monolith after a certain point, specifically after you reach the Red Forest and go into Pripyat. Seriously, the end game of this game is probably one of the most unforgiving slogs in any game I have played. The game has absolutely no chill as it throws literally 100+ guys at you with the best equipment they have to offer, with it basically becoming one giant point of no return.
As for the traders/quest givers, there ARE technically more for the factions, but there is almost no reason to actually talk to any of the faction leaders or their specific traders because their stock tends to be crap and their (infinitely respawning) missions are even more basic and bland, almost always being ""go here, kill these guys, come back."" Riveting. Speaking of...

Crap side missions: Almost all side missions in this game are infinite basic and repeatable tasks that involve just going somewhere and killing everything there 90% of the time. The only exceptions are the main guys I listed above, but even then their missions are little better, usually just being fetch quests when they aren't generic destroy missions.

Kind of short: Despite me dragging my feet and spending far more time than I should have just doing side missions and stockpiling money I didn't need,  I was still able to finish the whole game in slightly under 30 hours despite it's freeform nature. If you care little for the side missions and know what to do, you could probably finish the whole thing while still doing almost everything the game has to offer in around 15 hours. While the other games in the series are arguably even shorter, they make up for it in replayability. The lack of any meaningful choices to make (specifically in reference to factions) makes it so that there is honestly little replayability in this game, as every playthrough will more or less play out the same way, and despite how many endings their are, almost every ending can be achieved in a single playthrough if you really go out of your way to do so and know what to do.

Despite all this, I still recommend this title solely because it's still STALKER, and also the fact that's it's story is arguably the most important to understanding the setting as a whole. The unique direction of the story and presentation alone is probably worth at least giving it a shot, but I will not sugarcoat that I believe that from a gameplay perspective, this game is indisputably the weakest of the bunch.",1665263243,1665263243,True,1,0,0.503148078918457031,1,True,False,False

I do not advice to play the vanilla version of the game since the gunplay is in such a broken state. I'd recommend STALKER:SoC to players who are patient and ready to mod the game.

pros
++ great atmosphere and setting
++ some memorable moments
+ Stalker has a different feel compared to Metro despite many similarities. especially when it comes to open world vs solid, but linear campaign
+ good story
+ old, but weirdly charming graphics
+ many mods

cons
-- gunplay has many problems:
1. body hits hardly do any damage at all. only headshots are worth it and it still takes too many of them. especially when enemies are wearing full armour
2. weapons, especially the early ones, are hilariously lacking in both strength and accuracy. this is likely why many players rage quit during the first mission and never touch this game again
3. most weapons give you a headshot damage boost, but there is a 'time_to_aim' delay that you have to wait in order for it to kick in again. this means that spraying the enemy in full auto is basically useless, forcing you to wait for some time for the next headshot. you can mod this out or find a mod that does it for you. this feature is terrible on every level
4. enemies hardly stagger when hit. one of the biggest signs of a good gunplay is that enemies stagger when hit. it hardly happens in this game. particularily non-human enemies seem to lack any damage in-take animations. humans do stagger somewhat when the head is hit, but not for long and you have to wait for your damage boost anyway.
5. for a game that requires you to aim for the head, the crosshair is surprisingly ****. too big and hardly visible during fire fights
- personally I don't like too many survival elements in shooters. however, this might be a pro for other players
- last mission throws balancing completely out of the window. devs must have been trolling us

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
STALKER: SoC has many things going for it. There is a reason why STALKER: SoC still is beloved by many fans around the world and why modders have created hundreds of mods. Still, the gunplay has so many issues that I only recommend the game to players who plan to mod the game in some ways. I would have enjoyed my playthrough much more if I did.

Information:
the difficulty level is confusing. most players will tell you to play on the highest difficulty level since both the player and the enemies will die faster compared to lower difficulty levels. Others have called this a myth. I don't know what is correct, but I do encourage you to do some research on that before starting a new campaign.

Tweaks:

I did eventually buy a retail copy on PC/DVD but I lost it. Kind of awkward to play this now in 22 with the whole Ukraine conflict happening...(yikes) 

I really hated C.O.D. at the time and was looking for something more interesting. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. had that 'horror movie' feel to it, waaayyy different from what C.O.D. was about. It has a few weird demon zombies in the game messed up from radiation that try to bite and slash @ U. You get to shoot them and a ton  of Slav gangsters battling over a barren radioactive wasteland. I've beaten the game a couple times (with the bad ending) and still don't really get the whole plot. The main character you play has amnesia for some unknown reason and he has to retrace his steps to find something important. If it were me I would get the F out of there before the military shoots everything up. I did play the prequel and the sequel but It made me bored and I and kept coming back to this.

 For some reason this game is really nostalgic to me and I remember having lots of fun playing the game while everyone else was calling each other curse words on C.O.D. I don't speak Ukrainian or Russian, so maybe the option for English dialog would have been helpful at the time.

2. stealth is broken. avoid combat and stay in the shadow.

3. everything wants you dead. mutants, anonalies, humans and the environment. stay sharp and never let your guard down.

4. game is hard.

5. the world is MASIVE, explore the map and you will find factions, mutants and a lot of lore.

-BONUS-

6. if you get bored of the base game, there are many mods to try.

overall good game.

In the opening hours of Stalker, you die almost instantly to everything. Bandits, mutants, anomaly's, zones of radiation will all kill you over and over again as you start to learn the world and how it ticks. Your weapons are especially bad, using just a measly pistol or a sawn-off shotgun if you can find one. They're inaccurate and don't do much damage unless you go for head shots. You have very few resources to heal or protect yourself from the elements early on so you might stumble into a hazardous area and then die because you didn't have the resources to stop the damage.

What I'm getting at here is that Stalker does not care what happens to you. It doesn't care if you die or if you live, it doesn't care if you have no bandages on you to save yourself from bleeding to death in that small firefight you just barely survived, and it doesn't care what you think of it's harsh world. It's world is gonna exist, with or without you.

This is all by design, because Stalker at it's core is trying to immerse you in it's unforgiving world. It's trying to make you feel like you're really just barely scraping by (especially in the opening hours). Living by the skin of your teeth, exploring and discovering strange oddities and soaking in the atmosphere is the name of the game.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, I recommend trying the game out. It's a game that doesn't hold your hand, for better or for worse. It's definitely not a game that's for everyone, however there is something really special about the world of Stalker I find appealing and despite it's flaws, I enjoyed it.",1663464902,1663464902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though I prefer Fallout NV in terms of writing and story telling, no game comes close to the atmosphere of SoC. This game scares me. It makes me stressed and anxious. In STALKER I'm always looking over my shoulder, trying to avoid the inevitable jump scare of a pack of dogs I didn't notice surrounding me. Inside the different buildings and facilities that feeling of being watched, or being **stalked** on might say, is intensified by 1000x. Horror games don't even compare to the shear terror of being almost out of amo and stuck in a dark, haunted lab in SoC.

The graphics might be ugly to some, but I find that they hold up pretty well. SoC is graphically consistent, and its environments are very well designed. Open spaces invoke a dreadful sense of isolation and vulnerability, while interiors are claustrophobic and uncomfortable.

While the human enemies are quite boring, this game's enemy design really shines in the mutants. All of them freak me out, and even the zombies manage to be uniquely unnerving.

STALKER's factions are based (loosely) on the real world factions of the Russian civil war. Freedom represent the Greens and Blacks, the former being non-aligned guerrillas and the latter being Makhnovian anarchists in Ukraine. Duty, on the other hand, is representative of the old Soviet mentality. They're strongly hierarchical, militaristic, and legalistic, but they fight to tame the chaos of the zone and protect the people living in it. The ecologists, military, and monolith exist as well, but they don't really have philosophies as each are beholden to larger organizations or ideas. The military exists to control the people in the zone arbitrarily at the request of an outside government, the ecologists simply want to research the zone regardless of politics, and monolith are a cult of brain fried soldiers and stalkers. Personally I find the factions interesting and an interesting tie in to Ukrainian history, but there are very few ways you can interact with them in game and most of their related quests are boring and pointless.

I've heard a lot of people online say that mods are basically a prerequisite to enjoy this game. They aren't. As of this review, all my hours are max difficulty vanilla. 

While there are quite a lot of crazy glitches you'll encounter, I strongly recommend giving the vanilla experience a try. The SOC experience hasn't been replicated to this day and won't be in the future. It might be dated, strange, and poorly balanced, but that's what makes it so worthwhile. 

It's sad that STALKER 2 is a massive cash grab with absurdly priced preorder bundles, preorder exclusive story content, devs that wanted to add NFTs to the game, and a scrapped Russian voice over the devs removed even after selling preorders for over a year under the pretense that there would be a Russian dub.

Traversing the wasteland and picking through the loot of my fallen enemies never got old. To me, it really felt like I was playing a single-player Escape from Tarkov, and honestly I think I wish Tarkov played more like this game! The firefights with the AI were surprisingly challenging even though I played on the normal difficulty, which meant that the gunplay never got boring, I can't count how many times I was engaged with multiple enemies, only to get blitzed and overwhelmed or flanked from another angle. The faction AI was really exciting to observe too, STALKERS roaming the land on their own journeys, mutants terrorizing hostile mercenaries, and skirmishes over territory between different factions. The main story was enjoyable and I never felt like I had to grind to progress, although the option to do so was always present. There is no leveling system, just loot to equip, and no barriers to equipping any loot at anytime other than limited loadout slots, which made adapting and experimenting on the fly very rewarding. Finally the atmosphere was splendid. The visuals and sound and narrative context had me completely immersed on many occasions. Working my way through labyrinthine underground facilities not knowing what and when something or someone would attack had my heart beating a little faster than usual.

The game was reworked, rebuild and restarted numerous times, with a bunch of cut content still being left inside the game's code and restored by the community. So it's basically a miracle that this game got released and it's actually pretty good. It is an Eastern European FPS, so it's barely functional on a basic level, but it's very atmospheric and endearing even in it's broken state.

The story of STALKER takes place in the Exclusion Zone near Chernobyl Atomic Electric Station where the catastrophic meltdown of 1986 occured. The zone spreads for hundreds of kilometeres outside of Pripyat and holds a lot of secrets and unexplainable phenomena. There are anomalies that change gravity or create energy blasts out of nowhere, strange and aggressive creatures that defy the laws of nature, and artifacts of unknown origins that give magical abilities to the ones that hold them. The setup for the plot is classic RPG stuff, you play as unknown and unnamed protagonist that suffers from amnesia. The only thing he has: a PDA with a single instruction to kill someone named Strelok. The only defining feature, the tatoo on his forearm that reads S.T.A.L.K.E.R. So the name that our character gets is the Marked One. As our protagonist we need to figure out who we are, who is Strelok, and solve the mystery of the Zone.
The story is decent, it holds you enough with it's mysteries and the setting to be interesting. The last few plot twists however were always too much for me. For a world as adark and unsettling as the Zone having M.Night Shyamalan twists at the end kind of cheapens the experience.

The graphics and technical performance of the game are an issue. The game is build from sticks and stones and prayers of it's developers to hold it all together on a budget of two sandwiches and a bottle of cheap vodka. The game looks fine, but definitely dated. But the graphics themselves are not the issue, it's everything around it. The game crashes a lot, sometimes there are bugs with post-processing that are fixed by rebooting the game, physics that were definitely impressive for the time, constantly freakout, causing stuff to fly around. Some missions can get bugged and become unasccessible, sometimes there are objectives markers that are still hang around on the map after completion. The AI acts like a complete idiot, sometimes blocking path or not reacting to neccesary triggers, or worse, repeating them everytime you are close. The game is better right now, compared to it's initial release, but that because of patches that were applied after release, which basically another layer of duct tape on top of cracks. Thankfully the game has passionate community that always has new mods and all sorts of stuff to make experience better (or worse).

The gameplay of STALKER is an FPS/RPG hybrid. You have to explore the open world of the Zone, complete quests, find new loot and supplies to survive, and fight mutants and enemy Stalkers. The Zone is split in several different locations with it's own factions controlling them, their own anomalies that spawn new artifacts, and their own secret stashes. By completing quests you earn money and sometimes supplies like food, medkits and bandages. You need to upgrade your gear before heading into a new location, since regular leather jacket won't cut it against high-caliber weapons and anomalies that literally split reality apart. And there is a lot of cool gear. Getting that new shiny gun or a new costume with higher defence stats are always motivation to get better for a new location. And also you can quip artifacts for their unique abilities. Some artifacts increase your resistances, increase your health or stamina, but most of them come with certain downsides, like contatly spewing radiation, so exposing yourslef to them is basically death, or lowering your resistance to certain effects. But with a right set of artifacts the game can be broken in your favor. The shooting is okay, but at the beginning with basic weapons it can be tough, since they don't o much damage and have horrible accuracy, but getting first decent weapon is a huge step up, and it's somewhat smooth sailing from there. Unfortunately, like I mentioned, the AI can be a bit of an idiot. Enemies have some semblance of self-preservation with getting into cover and avoinding grenades, sometimes they can even flank you. But most of the time they have horrible aim and can even just stand in one place waiting to get shot in the head. One time a whole squad of monolith idiots just went one by one throgh the door where I just shot them one by one. The only reason enemies are a threat is by their sheer numbers. They don't have a good aim, but sometimes they can hit and if there is a lot of them, they can shred you pretty quick. The combat with mutants is just trying to stay away from them. Most of them are melee, with exception of psychic mutatnts like poltergeist and controller. But those guys are a rarity and only appear in underground laboratories. 

But the game is really good, for a project that was restarted and rebuild multiple times. it's janky, it's even broken sometimes, but such is the life in the Zone. if you want to have an alternative post-apocalyptic experinece in irradiated wasteland with a more of a harcore flair to it, STALKER is really good. It's setting is memorable and melancholic, it's horrifying, and sometimes comforting. It can be infuriating, but when you get into it, youcan't stop.

Somewhat confusing at first as your character has amnesia and the story takes a while to speed up, only until the last areas of the game does it become more involved, with some ambitious ideas. The ending(s) are interesting but can come off as disappointing/anti-climactic, although a secret ending (The True Ending) explains the much needed backstory to the world you are in. In all, a slow start that begins to unravel itself as the game progresses which then really takes hold only until the last hours of gameplay. 

Gameplay: 

The game is very atmospheric and immersive, along with being difficult as you have to scavenge for supplies along with fighting enemies that heavily outnumber you. The latter being especially fun later in the game when you are kitted out in valuable weapons and armour, its the earlier hours however where the gameplay could turn many people off, for example, one of my biggest gripes was how inaccurate some of my weapons felt when aiming. This is due to weapons being found in the earlier stages being inherently inaccurate, making killing enemies frustrating as you essentially click on their head until a bullet finally hits them. When you can find a scoped weapon, combat becomes immediately better as now you can (somewhat) reliably kill enemies. The game also introduces items called 'artifacts', which are due to the supernatural game world, they are permanent stat boosts that come with both pros and cons, giving the game light RPG elements as you can mix and match what boosts you want to alter your gameplay. The gameworld is suprisingly large with it being segmented into different areas, with some hub areas for you to trade and pick up and return quests. Side quests are very basic, with most being simple fetch quests that can become frustrating as you have to go across different areas of the gameworld and return, for a reward which is often not worth the time put in, because of this there was little incentive for me to do side quests as I spent more time going from A to B than actually doing the quest. The main quest however is relatively straighfoward and could be beaten fairly quickly if you just want to experience the story. 

Overall, Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game worth experiencing for its atmostphere alone, and is a unique type of game that is not really seen on the market. Whilst it is frustrating at first, it becomes a great game once you stick to it and is quite memorable for its gloomy setting along with a punishing, almost tactical style of gameplay. 

8.5/10

This is one of the earliest survival FPS games, set in an alternate universe's Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Not only is the place irradiated, but reality is falling apart and there's also a ton of mutants. Plus, literally everybody in the zone is a combatant, and most of them are zealots, soldiers of fortune, or vicious opportunists. All of this leads to a ton of interesting ways to die, and the map design, enemy accuracy, and environmental hazards are all exceptionally challenging (punishing). TL:DR the game is hard. I've been electrocuted, irradiated, thrown into the sky by an angry vortex, blasted in the face with shotguns, chased down by horribly mutated dogs, set on fire, exploded, and I've just plain bled out. Such is life in the Zone.

If you can survive long enough to understand it, the story isn't bad. Everybody you meet is an Eastern European survivalist, quick to remind you that war is hell but camaraderie is appreciated. The game's threats extend beyond mere guns n' ammo, though - dark experiments into the human psyche (and 'noosphere'; the realm of ideas), piles of radioactive garbage, blood-chilling mutants, and malevolent military forces all conspire to make the Zone a particularly entertaining suburb of Hell. There's something new and awful around every corner. 

Of course, the game is hideous by modern standards. Keen modders have worked around that if you need decent graphics. The UI holds up remarkably well, though, and inventory management is refreshingly quick and clean.

If you like a challenge, enjoy old game engines, or appreciate gaming history, I'd give this a whirl. Despite the war with Russia impacting the studio, a S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 is in the works, so now's a pretty good time to experience the original.",1661002574,1661002684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It all started at Garbage where the difficulty would ramp up a bit with more enemies to fight, and a common face that would feel more unique after my encounters with him. 

Dying was a common occurrence to me (L bozo), ive probably seen the main menu more times than i have healing myself, so i felt defeated playing this game and i was close to quitting. But it was only until i went to Duty checkpoint in a thunderstorm at night that i was shown the reason to keep moving. 

There were a couple of Duty soldiers around but there was only 1 man next to a fire. He was sipping some red bull so i decided to chill opposite to him, at that point i was deciding to quit the game, but thats when he whipped out his guitar. 

During the piss-pouring rain, raging thunder and the clash of lightning, he played ‘He was a good stalker.’ As i listened while this thunderstorm was going on, i realized how ironic this is. How such a bad storm is beating down while this guy is playing this melancholic tune for me to hear, almost like hes making light out of a bad situation. So it dawned on me that this is an unforgiving game and i shouldnt quit just because of a few hard enemies, just try to have fun with a game that wants to fuck you over then pats you on the back and repeat. So i did what any person would do after seeing a concert performance like that, i gave him half of my food, ammo, bandages and the like for free (he was broke anyways so nothing to trade).

Hours go by at The Bar, Yanov, the scientists, Wild Territory, then back past the duty checkpoint. At that point I started to get tired of STALKER, not because im dying alot, I’m getting better and actually hiding behind cover alot now, but im just getting bored of it. I get to duty checkpoint and whaddya know, its nighttime and a thunderstorm is going off, while i see that guy in the distance next to the fire. I immediately run and sit next to the guy and wait until he pulls out his guitar, he does and i just listen to him while the storm rages on. Theres just something about the atmosphere of STALKER that just allures me to this game, just sitting next to a fire in a thunderstorm while a person strums his guitar, inspiring in a way. When he stopped to take out a bite of his big diet weenie, I felt invigorated and ready to go again for more of this beautiful game and what lies at the end.

To me that man and Duty checkpoint will be like home to me, if i ever feel like im ready to quit and be done with this game, i just go there and sit down hoping he sits as well so i could chill and talk with him.

And i know in my heart everytime a thunderstorm goes off at night he goes and sits down next to that fire, waiting for me to sit and listen to his songs of hope, so It is mandatory to listen to the calls of thunder when dusk comes.

Period dot period. Don't get me wrong. I love what the devs that broke off of GSC have made, the entire Metro series, but NOTHING compares to Stalker. The Metro series doesn't have the A-life engine running realistic animal and human behaviors in the background which makes every single game unique. If you've never played the Stalker series get on the bus before Stalker 2 drops. There's 3 games in the mix. A lot of people say you can skip Clear Sky. I wouldn't. It's fantastic with the Complete Mod to make it whole again. 

If you lOVE haunty shooters, games like Resident Evil, the Metro series, Alone in the Dark, Silent Hill, etc. If you are avidly looking forward to the Callisto Proticol. PLAY S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

I'm not completely oblivious when it comes to managing files in Windows.. even when following the most popular/upvoted guides on and outside of Steam (and each individual readme), learning how to install mods for Stalker SoC one by one takes some research and patience... i.e., more time than you want to spend.

Minus:
- Camera shaking
- Time-gated quests (go from one corner of the map to the opposite and then return)

The game is awesome! I recommend it!

A few problems, major problems, very frustrating problems:

1. At the beginning of the game (and later too) you can take up to 4 or 5 quests (you take them in the 1st zone), but you need to go to the 5th or 6th zone and go back. The whole go-there-then-return make almost 50% of the whole game (as maps-covering), in the run you'll find the better armors and weapons. When you return to the 1st zone for the reward, they are so looow-level (they are made as rewards for 1st zone leveling and, I don't know why, they aren't balanced for your actual level), and you don't need them. There's more - you need 2-3 game-days to go, complete and return (the quest is completed not when you make the demanded things, but when you return to the quest giver at the beginning of the game on the 1st zone!??), but you have only 1 game-day to complete all the quests?! This makes the game so annoying!

HINT: You can intall an add-on to disable the time limitation and complete the quests when you want. The game with the add-on is more fun!

2. I can't find where to go. There is a sewer, very hard on higher difficulty, because of the distance and almost 100%-accuracy of the enemies. Then I went to a town, and found a sniper rifle with longer range than the enemies. Like this, the game is a piece of cake and I don't have fun with the levels before. And now I don't know where to go, because all the maps are so easy with the rifle. I lost the fun of covering and tactics from the early-game-levels of the game.",1534691172,1659347584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One side mission will even have you kill half the Ukrainian military for 5 energy drinks and 1500 rubles (about $20 USD) Once you get the green hazard suit you are effectively DOOM guy, sprint around chugging energy drinks and killing everyone by instantly one tapping them in the dome with the GP37.

Even on release it came out a whole year before Fallout 3, and its intentional release was set before Half Life 2. It's easy to see the influence of Half Life and most notably Counter Strike on the game.

Shadow of Chernobyl starts out slowly with nothing but a sleeping bag. You get really weak weapons in the beginning, but these are relatively early replaced with rifles that can be used all until the end of the 20 hours it takes to finish the game.

The gunplay is like a match of CS. You come to a compound and it's all on you most of the time. The enemies have marksmanship accuracy while you need to carefully aim your shots. The steep learning curve, constant dying and reloading and bad weapons initially will deter many people from this game.

STALKER SoC is only played on hardcore mode of today, and is famously actually the ""easiest"" on Master difficulty. You need radiation pills and food as you go along and ammo has weight. Your carry limit is low enought to only being to carry 2 weapons plus ammo. You can fail one part of the main quest relatively early and be locked out of the good ending (I had to backtrack my save files when I understood this), and the final good ending has no quest markers. Near the end there is a point of no return which you might not be prepared for.

The story is... mysterious. I think that the mystery drives the game along with the ambience and world. No characters are particularly interesting, dialogue is poor, voice acting bad, the files to read passable at best. But the atmosphere. My God the atmosphere!

Very unique game, there truly is nothing like it. At times, like said, it feels like playing a tech demo of the future of gaming from 2003. Open world 3D FPS, what?

The game doesnt have the best graphics but it has one of the best moods and enviroment which you can experience
It took me 17 hours to beat the game and then i realized that there are like 13 or a little less endings which shows that replayability is high
Pros:
-High number of possible replays
-Mood in stalker makes it a game one of a kind and the monsters can scare you 
-Amount of stuff and options is high: you can destroy some factions or become friendly with them
-Engine of the game itself is pretty decent 
-Game has lots of mods so boredom shouldnt happen
Cons:
-You have to manually save most of the times and forgetting might take you 30-60 minutes away like me 
-Some npcs will have the perfect aim making it near impossible to defeat without grenades or lots of meds
-Quests in some moments dont explain what you have to do: you have an large terrain with enemies with absolutely no info on how to get to the location nor how to find the last enemy hiding somewhere


Conclusion:
The game is worth playing and with a discount the stalker bundle is great for hours of gameplay or even after completing every of the games you will try stalker anomaly which is free?",1658265985,1658265985,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl has a lot of positives, but it also has one huge problem. 
Let's start with the good sides. The story is quite mysterious, which makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. a really interesting game to play. You want to reveal all the secrets of the zone and immerse yourself in the lore of the S.T.AL.K.E.R universe as deep as possible. 
Gameplay is also quite good as long as you play the main story. Side quests are literally ""go - kill"" or ""go - find"" and the reward for these quests is useless every time. 
When everything seems so good, sadly, there is one big problem - the technical part of the game. The graphics for 2007 is quite good, but besides that... AI shooting and killing you trough the walls; AI stacking on top of each other; AI getting stuck in textures; Enemies reappearing in the same spawn zones again and again; Sometimes you fall into textures; Sometimes the game crashes without any reason, and this list can go on and on. Sometimes it's so bad you're not even sure whether the game has glitched again or everything is going as planned...
[b] Overall, is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl worth playing today ? I would say it's worth speedrunning it in 7-10 hours just for the story. It's good, but it lacks optimization. 6/10 [/b]",1657810653,1657810653,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The setting of the game is great. I finally broke down and bought this game and tired to enjoy it but I just didn't find it to be a great game, or even a good game.

First of all, it pulls off the atmosphere pretty well. STALKER in theory is a great concept. The game fails to deliver on it's game play. It's slow paced and atmospheric, which is fun, but the gun play doesn't suit that sort of game play. It's a first person shooter but it has the slow paced movement that you would expect from a 3rd person cover based shooter.  This leaves you basically trading health for health packs to kill enemies most of the time. Enemies come out into the open to shoot at you, you spray back and they or their team mates shoot you. There is no real skill to this. It's simply: ""Do you have enough health packs to get through the gun fights?"" If the game were cover based timing would play a better role and it would suit the rest of the slow paced aspect of the game. If your character could move with speed and agility the game would be more action packed and you could benefit from your reaction time. Instead, the gun play fails on both levels and it's not a good slow paced shooter, or a good fast paced shooter. 

There is no cool down between using health packs which would again, accentuate skill. You can spam them into infinity if you have enough of them. That isn't very fun at all. Then there is the constant looting of every body just to make sure that you can get enough ammo to fight the enemies. All enemies drop handgun ammo. But pretty early on in the game the handgun becomes useless. Not all enemies drop ammo for the automatic rifles that they are shooting you with. You see an enemy with an AK, you kill the enemy, pick up his gun and it's empty, and he has no AK ammo on him. I only got 6 hours into the game and I was carrying 1200 rounds of pea shooter handgun ammo and was constantly having to switch back and forth between the AK and the SMG because the ammo for any meaningful weapon was so scarce.

The constant looting of bodies unnecessarily slows the game down even more. IDK if I've ever played a first person shooter before where I didn't automatically pick up a persons ammo by walking over it. But the game tries to pull off some sort of RPG element with how much you can carry and ammo can weigh you down.  

The heart of the problem for this game is that it tries to be an RPG and a first person shooter and it doesn't really pull of either of those goals very well. If this game were a cover based shooter like Mass Effect without the annoying loot and weight management that slows the game down too much it would be a great RPG. If your character were faster and more agile with limited use of health packs and more ammo (and again losing the weight management) it could be a fun FPS with a good story.",1657579820,1657579820,False,4,0,0.420406103134155273,0,True,False,False

Protips: If the headbobbing annoys the hell out of you like it does me, enter ""cam_inert0"" into the console.

Play on Master Difficulty!! On Novice there is a 60% that each of your shots will literally disappear due to an odd development choice that makes you miss even if you are perfectly on target. Playing on Master will make bullets do more damage on both ends as well as reduce the bullets that are fated to miss. The AI is smarter on Master and the game is very tough, but on lower difficulties it's just frustrating.

Edit: Everything I said about the difficulty is wrong, this was a common myth that the majority of the community believed but it has been debunked. 
Difficulty does change the global bullet damage though, meaning on easy mode the enemies will be bullet sponges but so will you. I still recommend playing on Master, or even Advanced just to strike a balance between difficulty and bullet sponges.",1530768650,1657526878,True,1,0,0.498666673898696899,0,True,False,False

I feel like it's the sort of game that gets much better the more you play it due to it's semi steep learning curve and a few outdated game mechanics such as the map and stamina system that need to be learned over time. However, if you are willing to stick with it, this is one of the best games you will ever play.

The games main strengths include:
> A chilling and creepy atmosphere (especially in underground).
> One of the coolest game worlds I have personally ever seen.
> The best tactical FPS gameplay and AI I have ever seen.
> Plenty of things to do such as finding caches and completing sidequests.

The games main drawbacks include:
> Hard to get into (my first playthrough was nowhere near as good as my second due to me not understanding game mechanics fully).
> Unplayable without Zone Reclamation Project mod (easy to fix though).
> It's pretty old (2007), so some parts are quite outdated like parts of the graphics.

Even when it gets tough, its still really enjoyable and rewarding. Granted, the game may feel a little old for today's time, but you could always try out the bajillion mods available for this game. 
Although, I would recommend a vanilla playthrough first with some bug fixes (see Zone Reclamation Project).
No real cons, other than.... what in the hell is the accuracy of the guns. I know for a fact that playing at Master difficulty does nothing to make enemies feel less bullet- spongey. When the bullets don't hit where you want to, it gets really annoying.
The real trick is to crouch and go prone (or lie down?), then shoot. Even at lower difficulties, you can easily headshot some poor mercenary 100m away with a goddamn pistol.
The sound design and ambience is really immersive, although it is a bit saddening to not understand what the soldiers are saying near campfires. Gun sounds are okay, with the player having to compensate for recoil. Mutants still look terrifying for such an old game, and some straight up make you piss in your pants.

Stalker is moody, atmospheric, interesting, creepy and a hell of a lot of fun. Its deep and challenging and has one of the most interesting game worlds in gaming. While the game can sometimes be buggy and the sidequests arent very worthwhile you wont find an experience quite like it.

However, this edition of stalker is special in many ways. Combat was much more difficult and the mods for this game were off the charts in terms of their quality and the refinement the community has developed. I highly recommend Autumn Aurora to anyone considering this game - even for a vanilla play through. It does not change the game so deeply as to nullify the original experience - in fact it enhances it.

Anyways,
This game is like Metro meets Fallout...but it still manages to have more atmosphere than both (albeit not if both were combined). This is the kind of game that would've converted me to PC gaming had I been given a shot at trying it.

If you are on the fence about this game, let me give you a few key reasons I keep coming back.
The gunplay is brutal. You can die quickly if you're an idiot (or unlucky).
The Voice Acting is actually really good.
The atmosphere; It set the mark for games like this.
But the biggest point is that something different seems to happen every time I come back. Enemies do not always do the same things, people are not always in the same places, and monsters are not always roaming the same corners.

Now, I will warn you. This game is from 2007. It's ugly. It's old. It's brutal. And it's crude. It's the definition in its raw form of ""A face only a mother could love,"" but it is worth it if you like horror RPGs (I guess that's what this would be?)

Now, if you got this far and you are about to buy it, also consider strolling over to ModDB (or google) Stalker Complete 2009. It's simple to do, but it improves a LOT of outdated elements. Purists may give you crap, that's fine. Once you play the game through, explore the Stalker subreddit, and look into mods like Dead Air. This game has been tweaked to brutal detail to offer dangerous and unique experiences.

Highly reccomend you get the Zone Reclamation Project mod since it squashes a lot of bugs and allows you to change some things. I personally made it so i could trade weaponry with other Stalkers to better arm them + allowed Stalkers to avoid Anomalies instead of just walking into them.

Even without ZRP Stalker SOC is a great game. I've had a blast just travelling from different parts of the map hauling gear and other bits and bobs to sell.

Its A.I is also the best I've ever seen, with totally unscripted events happening that really make you feel like its a living breathing world. For instance, a campsite with a group of friendly stalkers or I quite often trade with and chill with was being threatened by an incoming Spetsnaz patrol which lead to a very intense firefight which had me scrambling for any kind of foothold as I desperately tried to save my friends. By the end of it I had an excess of AK's and the surviving Stalkers now considered me friends which really did lead to a bond between me and the NPC's

SOC is great at getting you to care for NPCs. You at first value friendly NPC's as they serve as an extra gun out in the Zone thats killing mutants and Bandits and also as someone to trade with (usually selling things to them) so you don't have tot travel all the way to Traders. However with time you really begin to value the NPC's as in the very hostile Zone where almost everything wants to kill and bandits seem to be everywhere seeing a friendly face is quite refreshing and allows you to take a breather. When one dies I genuinely feel sad, not just because theres one less Stalker out in the Zone potentially killing mutants and bandits but because the Zone got just that more inhospitable.


Also it runs really well, with vanilla being perfectly fine.

TLDR: I really like this game, you should play it, runs great vanilla, download ZRP mod.

When I first played it, I was met with a lot of frustration since I played on the hardest difficulty. A lot of my time was spent quick saving after killing an enemy and dying to the next. The gun play was something to get used to since I felt like I couldn't hit anything while everything could hit me with ease. However, after getting better gear and becoming well-acquainted with how the game works, I began to see the beauty of it. The combat can be cut-throat and keeps you on alert. The horror aspect of the game is what really makes it shine when you're slowly making your way through dark tunnels and decrepit buildings out of fear. The enemy variety and design is awesome when it comes to the monsters. The different factions are also interesting. The story keeps you engaged with wanting to reach Pripyat and the Wish Granter. The setting and the different zones also keep things fresh.

You play as an amnesiac man named Marked One, who continues the last mission he remembered: hunt down a stalker named Strelok who managed to enter the center of the Zone, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It's an open-world FPS-RPG where you collect items and do quests. Imagine Fallout mixed with Metro, set in a post-apocalyptic, post-Soviet country with bandits, mutants, and good ol' radiation. It has levels based on real locations, too, like the ghost town Pripyat.

Compared to its prequel which I played first, SoC is better in so many ways despite the prequel being the newer one. The early missions are simple and easy, welcoming to any new player. Money, armor, weapons, and artifacts are also very easy to find, you don't need to buy them from shop or go inside an anomaly as they are given as rewards or just laying around. Some unique, more powerful weapons and armor are available and easy to find. All of these combined makes the combat easier to handle, but still a bit dangerous. The final levels are sadly linear and has plenty of combat, but I didn't really find it difficult thanks to my gear.

However, those easy-to-find gear came with a consequence: money becomes almost useless. I always play scavenger in open-world games, and I don't ever need to use money as there are no overpowered gear that is only available at traders. There's also no fast travel, not even those paid guides, and you have to run back and forth to do some sidequests. Biggest flaw of the game. I only recommend doing the more unique ones, such as find armor/weapon or the ""kill named person"" assassination quests which yield good rewards and unique dialogue. Otherwise, the backtracking gets tedious and you only get generic lines and useless money.

This game has 7 endings, but you can only get 3 per playthrough. 1 is a ""false"" ending, which is short and unsatisfying, but depends on your actions during the game. The other 2 are the ""true"" endings. To get the true endings, you must do a series of short sidequests involving meeting people from your past, but other than that what you did doesn't really matter, unlike in the false ones. The bad ending is only a bit longer than the false ones, but happens in a different room. The good ending, and also the canon one, is quite longer and involves a lot of combat. But it's worth it, and it gives you a chance to try out your powerful end-game gear.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a pretty great post-apocalyptic game, and worth a try if you like the aforementioned Fallout and Metro games. I kinda recommend playing Clear Sky first though, since the confusing mechanics there are different from here so you will still be confused if you play it later. Get the bad one out of the way first, and enjoy feeling powerful and rewarded in this game.",1655053019,1655053019,True,35,0,0.769690811634063721,4,True,False,False

Let me explain why it is simply a fantastic game:

1- Atmosphere & Story :

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. takes place in the ""Zone"" , an unforgiving and deadly place formed after a fictional second Chernobyl Disaster, the area is completely devastated by radiation, mutants, anomalies and valuable artifacts formed from these anomalies. Soon people who call themselves Stalkers flood the Zone to make a fortune from said artifacts. Military and Scientists ( or Ecologists ) also came to study and understand The Zone. Our protagonist ""Marked One"" is an amnesiac Stalker with only one mission ""Kill Strelok"". An unknown stalker.

Atmosphere is the strongest part of the game, developers actually went to the Chernobyl NPP and city of Pripyat to create the game's world, and it looks great. You travel from army outposts to stalker camps, secret labs to underground tunnels and it all feels like a part of a real and living world.

2- Weapons & Shooting Mechanics :

You have your standart assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, grenades and sniper rifles (and a little surprise near the end). Due to game's setting, most of the assault rifles consist of Warsaw Pact ones but NATO weapons are also present, further into the game. Shooting mechanics are solid and when the bullets hit the enemy, they react appropriately. Silencers, scopes and grenade launchers can be installed to weapons. Weapons also have realistic recoil, individual ammo, varying accuracies and firing rates.

3- Factions :

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R. there are 8 factions, you can work for some of them but others are strictly enemies (Monolith , Military etc).
You start the game as a rookie stalker and choose who you want to help. I don't want to spoil the factions so much as they are introduced as the story progresses so I will cut this here.

4- Artifacts & Anomalies :

Anomalies are hazards created by the disaster and almost all of them are deadly to the player, some will burn you, others will shock you, but they have one good characteristic : they spawn artifacts.
All artifacts have special properties and when attached to stalker's belt they grant useful abilities such as giving higher stamina or lowering radiation sickness. They also worth a lot of money.

5- Mutants :

Besides the human enemies you have mutants, animals or humans warped by radiation or experimentation. You start tangling with measly blind dogs to enormous pseudogiants. All of them are unique and some drop mutant body parts which you can sell to the Ecologists. Also some of the more dangerous mutants have kind of introductions:
Imagine walking through an abondoned lab and you hear a roar, like an animal roar but something is not right , then the ground starts to shake, you ready your trusty rifle and ...
In short, mutants really add great horror and help improve the already fantastic atmosphere of the game.

6- Fanbase & Mods :

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. just like Half-Life, has the most active fanbase I have ever seen.
Still to this date there are mods coming out for it. I strongly advise any fan of the game to give at least one good story mod a shot after completing the game. To me, there is nothing better than diving into the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. once more with new missions, enemies, items, mutants, and sometimes even cars.

As I finish this review I want to thank GSC for this amazing series, there is still nothing like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. . It is oozing with originality, has a great fanbase, mods and overall an amazing atmosphere",1654913537,1654913537,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With rifles long range battles feel like waiting until you get good RNG to finally get a HS. A cool mechanics like noise wasn't important at all and stealth felt unrewarding.

The story is an absolute banger and the atmosphere is top notch.
If you are a someone who has played game like Fallout series, this i absolutely recommend this game for you
Tho Fallout is excel in interaction with world and NPCs S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is excel in atmosphere and story.

this game run on X-Ray Engine 1.0 the first engine model that powered the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, because of that there will be tons of bugs even after patches, but like Bethesda's games the community come to the rescue.

here's some of mods that i recommend :
- The Starter Pack https://www.moddb.com/mods/starter-pack
Like the name suggest it a starter pack for those whose new to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, it's basically a vanilla game with improved gameplay and some visual improvement, it includes : 
- ""Original Weapons Renewal"" 3 a HD rendition of SoC Vanilla weapon
- ""Photo Realistic Zone"" a texture pack for ground, trees, structures etc
- ""Stalker Weather Overhaul"" a better looking weather and skyboxes
- ""STALKER Shaders MAX 1.06"" for better looking shaders, adds depth of field, slight motion blur
- ZRP ""Zone Reclamation Project"" a community-supported modpack for overall bugfixes
- ""FOV Switcher v17"" as the name suggest changing your FOV to your preference
- there will be mechanics you can ask to repair your gears just like in CS and CoP they're located in Freedom's base
and Duty's Rostok

- Repair Kits Revamped https://www.moddb.com/mods/repair-kits-revamped
adding a repair kits in case your weapon breaks in the firefight

- SoC HD Models Addon https://www.moddb.com/mods/shadow-of-chernobyl-hd-models-addon
like the name suggest it add an HD models to SoC, tho the community is divided about this mod

It's a product of a long and troubled development process by an eastern European developer to create a very ambitious project. And eastern European games have fairly odd design elements by default, even when they are not trying to be ground breaking. 

Play the game for the first time without mods, without watching videos about it, without reading walk-throughs, be completely on your own and the information the game gives you. For some this is not going to be possible due to certain technical issues on an unmodded game, but if you can, do it. 

STALKER is a first person shooter in a semi-open world with roleplaying and minor survival-horror elements. And STALKER is also none of those. STALKER is very hard to talk about. The open world nature combined with its shooter elements seems almost prophetic when looking a few years later at games like Ubisoft's FarCry series almost doing the same thing that STALKER did, except on a more polished and mass-marketable level.
[list]
 [*]The first person shooter part of the game feel unresponsive, you'll be questioning whether your shots even do damage or merely pass through your opponents. 
 [*]The open world is segmented in several smaller levels that break up the pacing of the game. Some levels are small or linear enough not to provide any sense of being open at all.
 [*] The roleplaying aspects are limited to weapons and armours having arbitrary statistics, a very RPG-like progression system (even though there is no levelling up or directly improving your character) and some open dialouge choices which might affect parts of the game.
 [*]The survival-horror elements are limited to a hunger requirement (that is so generous most players don't even realize it exists on their first playthrough, it becomes obvious only after you start selling all of your food items, thinking they are just a glorified way to regen health), inventory management and traversing an environment where everything constantly wants you dead.
[/list]


On the other hand, all aspects of the game have fine attention to detail, that bring it well out of the crowd.
[list]
 [*]All weapons experience bullet drop, realistic bullet travel time, bullets can ricochet and pierce materials. Although the combat distances don't get long enough to notice until very late in the game, it creates a nice differentiation between different types of weapons.
 [*]Most weapons have at least 2 types of ammunition available. Some are straight upgrades, others are more effective against one type of opponent while less effective against others, but help vary things up a little.
 [*]Headshots are incredibly deadly. Oponents feel like bullet sponges only if you don't score headshots. If most games have 2 or 3 times damage multipliers for headshots, STALKER has a damage multiplier of 5 on humans and 10 on other enemies. This might seem like a completely meaningless mechanic, but it completely changes the way you perceive difficulty in the game. If you can score the headshots, most firefights will always feel too easy.
 [*]Even though your character remains completely the same throughout the game, you feel constant progression of power due to how the weapons and armour are distributed. Exploration and some sidequesting can be used to get ahead of the curve, giving a very RPG-like feeling of leveling up. The starting weapons are completely awful, which helps with this power-leveling perception, when you can look back at how much better everything you have towards middle/end of the game compared to lowly bandits.
 [*]The atmosphere! The world inhabitants are obviously emulated rather than simulated, but the mood it creates when you see random loners just passing by from one location to another, getting attacked by wild boars on the way, while the gunfire attracts a group a bandits you were supposed to eliminate for a quest, that later get ripped apart by said boars, which then drag the human corpses in bushes and feed on them. All this in a daytime cycle which transitions extremely smoothly, with nice weather effects and an ambiance ranging from desolate to creepy gives a feeling of a world that actually is somewhat alive, even despite how incredibly morbid everyday life of its inhabitants are.
 [*]Weapons and armour detereorate. Weapons become less accurate, they can start jamming, armour loses effectiveness. Even though you might have the best gear, you are always looking for a replacement, in case you can find something in better condition. Such minor aspects make the survival part of the game truly shine.
 [*]The world is full of dilemmas. There are no good guys or bad guys in the entire game world. One faction argues that the Zone must be destroyed, because it endangers the rest of the world, another faction believes the logical solution is to study it at the expense of people's lives. Even the ""neutral"" loners in all of STALKER games often come from criminal backgrounds, some are selfish, some came to the Zone for the thrill and the adventure. In all of this, nobody is in the right. [/list]


And so much more little things...


And despite all the praise I could give, this is by no means a game for everyone...
The game is too difficult or too easy for some players. Small groups of human enemies can be dispatched with a single magazine while not taking any damage yourself, if you know how to. Money is also constantly coming in even when you don't try and there's not a lot to use it on. In other scenarios turning a corner to see a pack of 15 dogs charging at you spells a lot of pain at the very least. This is also the charm of the game - no matter what, you always feel vulnerable, even inferior weapons at point blank range can nearly instantly wipe you out. Some will find this immersive, as it's not just another power fantasy, and the best choice might actually be evading an encounter at all if possible. Some will find this just a source of frustration, helplesness and annoyance. 
Something very specific to eastern European and Russian games is the prevelance of how easy it is to nearly instantly die. Wrong dialouge option? Those 4 guys armed to the teeth around you turn hostile when you don't even have your weapon drawn. Wasn't sure what that weird thing on the ground was? It's a gravitational anomaly that drains stamina, making you unable to escape and you die. With time you get used to the game's shenanigans, and again is part of the charm, making the very first playthrough so memorable, other times this will cause cheap deaths and wasted time because the last save was made 30 minutes ago.
The localization and translation (at least to English) work on the game ranges from well done, to mildly amusing all the way to downright stupid. Although this creates some very good meme material, one cannot deny how jarring it is to see some of the voice acting play out right there in front of you.

[h1]Mods, patches[/h1]
The game might require some tweaking to get running well. For my personal taste, default visual bloom settings were just atrocious, but become very pleasant after adjusting some values in the console. A lot of people will recommend all kinds of mods. My only suggestion is that if you really must play with mods that fix some of the issues the game has, download ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) - this is mostly a compilation of bug fixes while not changing the base gameplay. Most other mods vastly alter core gameplay, most notably increasing difficulty, accounting for the playerbase probably having previous experience with the game.
Early game in all STALKER games is just painful - the guns are inaccurate, nothing does enough damage, you die a lot. I can see how this might be a turnoff for some.

This game is based on upon the chernobyl nuclear powerplant disaster and I thought I was cool to see it based upon that. When I first played it I got bored of it. 4 months laters I played it again and was already addicted to the universe of the game. It can be a little hard to get used to it at first. Some enemies can survive more shots than you think. Some can take about 10 body shots to 2 headshots to be taken down, depending on your gun. You have to watch your inventory a lot because you can be carrying a lot of stuff which can slow you down when running. There are times where you will die a lot (Died about 10 times in one area), so it's best to save before hand after every gun fight to not get suprised by the next one. My favorite part of this game is going through the city near the end of the game where you can see the hotel houses and the ferris wheel. It gives me a bit of a cod 4 vibe.

At first I didn't enjoy it due to it being vastly different. But this year I came back and I delve into the world and did everything I could. And truly this is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Although this game is a bit on the older side, everything people praised it for were true. The atmosphere the world gives off and the lore is simply unbeleievable, you truly feel how sad and depressing the world is in STALKER, especially if you watch videos on youtube that do translation for all npcs. You realize how sad everyone is because they are just trying to make enough money so they can make it by. Or when you find the zombies you realize their mublings are their broken memories. Many of them saying they will come home to their daughter or crying out to their mother as they die. Or with the military, their government has simply abandoned them there, they were given no real objective besides no one enters or leaves, until finally after some of the players actions, they try to take control (I wont spoil it).

Each faction aswell is well written and I can see myself siding with almost any of them since they, depending on the players views, are morally gray. Duty wants to contain and destroy the zone, Freedom want to allow all to enjoy the zone and something that shouldnt be contained, Loners are simply random people trying to make it rich, mercenaries getting paid to do things for outer powers, Monolith trying to protect their ""god"" of sorts, Military just doing their job, Zombies poor stlkers that got their brains scorched and are now husks of their former selves (if you ever encounter one please put them down stalker), Ecologists simply want to study the zone and its anomalies.

Truly one of the best games out there. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a gritty atmosphere and want to have an adventure in the zone.

The best parts are having to take the game slow because the enemies are tough to the point that you have to become really well acquainted with F6. Having to keep track of weight limit, armor condition, food and other stuff also made one of the most immersive experience i have had. This game always felt tough but fair.. that is until the NPP level that was just pure chaos and just not fun. Who thinks that having to run from helicopters  and hordes of the strongest enemies that kill you in seconds all while you have to rush to make it under a certain amount of time a fun concept? That was just pure hell and not enjoyable. I know what you guys are going to say get good and turn the difficulty up to master to kill enemies faster; which is a complete lie by the way. That is how us manly man and master stalkers play the game. I personally came here to enjoy a challenging but fair game whose atmosphere will engulf me and through out most of the game it did just that.My favorite parts of the game was going under ground in the dark and having to check every corner  to make sure no enemies where hiding to jump on me. Enemies being able to kill you quickly always kept you on edge and it was truly immersive experience. The level with the floating items that will fly/tossed at you was my favorite, truly fun. The sounds in this game are also great and really add to the overall experience. Things i did not like are how guns work in this game, if i put my iron sites on your dome and you are not wearing a helmet i expect to kill you, but here it was guessing game on whether your bullets will even connect, this made you waste ammo just to artificially raise the difficulty. Also why can i not have a shotgun as my side arm and a assault rifle as my main? the handgun is basically useless and just took unnecessary space. The final thing i did not like was that NPP level, and it was the thing that made me quit out the game. Why do games designers think that hordes of enemies and rockets going of everywhere is the solution to a final level? Overall i definitely recommend this game even with it flaws it is one of the best shooters i have ever played. The creatures/enemies are tough, the atmosphere is incredible, and going underground or into a bunker is just an incredible experience. If you have not played this game just do it and enjoy one of the best gaming experiences i have had in a long time.

You cannot repair weapons, that nice unique weapon you like to use, better keep it for special occasions or prepare yourself to throw it away halfway though the game, cause they have a finite number of uses. This is specially annoying when said unique weapon is chambered to a different ammo caliber, fire-rate and accuracy are good but they are not that special, having a nice gun that use cheap ammo is. The viper 9x18 is only automatic weapon that uses the trash 9x18 ammo you are going to be drowning in. 
Pistols are kinda of useless, you take as much time to reload as to change the weapon so having a backup weapon for when you can't reload is not that effective, plus they kinda suck. Where the automatic pistols at? Who stole all the automatic pistols in the Zone?
There are no normal rifles either, only sniper rifles. Doesn't really affect the experience. Sure it would be nice to have a medium range lever-action rifle but you can live without them.
Grenades are kinda difficult to use since you can't cook them. You can hold right click to charge a meter that would make think it's how long you charged the grenade timer but it only affects throw distance, so you can't use really effectively, plus the physics are kinda of fricked(fucked) up and makes the grenades difficult to aim, sometimes the grenades bounce right back at you.
Hunger, it's kinda there, never knew it existed until 30hrs in, cause the game gives you so much food.
Factions are also kinda there too. They don't really matter a lot and it's actually better to not involve in, since joining one side will make the other one hostile and that's just more enemies to  fight.
This one is just personal, rocket launchers suck and i don't mean they are underpowered, they function exactly like they should, an insta-kill basically, the problem is enemies with rocket-launchers they have unlimited ammunition and will just spam them over and over, and when you are using the exoskeleton armor you can't run so good luck dodging the rocket. Get a sniper and kill them as fast as you can.

I had a blast with stalker but I'm not gonna lie, there are problems.

Positives:
Atmosphere is really well done, it really immerses you in the world mainly because of the sound design and lighting which are really good despite graphics having aged.
The shooting is great, this is a bit controversial because the game uses a chance system for bullets missed in order to roughly simulate recoil, I didn't mind this mechanic too much because it made finding better weapons very rewarding since they did more damage and were more accurate.
The enemy AI is nothing to laugh at either, they try to defend themselves and hide behind cover, or in bushes so they are harder to see, and they imploy strategies like flanking you, which adds to the sense of realism and keeps combat encounters fresh and always fun.
I also like that the game is straight to the point, no skill trees, or many branching dialogues or exposition, generally you will get a job, do it and get a reward, simple.

Negatives:
Well I played the game as vanilla as can be, meaning 0 mods and 0 fan made patches.
The game is buggy, from quests not completing when you clear the objective, to quest markers marking places where there is nothing or quests instantly completing because your target spawned on top of a campfire when you entered the area he was at.
The story, despite interesting isnt very well told... for the most part of the game I was completing objectives I didnt really know how they would help me? For example, going into the several undeground labs, some of them I dont know why I had to go there ( and I just finished the game at the time of this review), or the fact that the route to the true ending is locked behind a chain of side quests that you don't realise the importance of, because they just pop on your pda without much alarm after completing some main objective. 

Conclusion:
Overall I think Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl is a pretty great game and damn well worth a buy, I can see why it is still talked about today, and it was one hell of a good time playing through it, the gameplay loop is on point despite the way the story is delivered having its flaws, buy it.",1653249352,1653251114,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Gun play is atrocious and the AI gets away with so much, that it just doesn't feel enjoyable at all. Though direct engagements are not really the intention, hit detection and damage taken by enemies is abysmally implemented. I tested out a few interactions and found some enemies surviving more than 5 point blank shots to the head, some point blank shots somehow missing enemies, all while i'm bleeding out from a couple shots taken halfway across a location. If there are groups of enemies, they seem to clump up a lot too, usually where i was last heard or seen. Then that's it, they just stand there indefinitely.

- Completely stop moving if holding 10kg too much.
- Maps need loading across zones and no way to carry stuffs back to traders.
- And there are indeed only a limited number of traders out there.
- Game is totally looter unfriendly.

Workaround: 
- Just drag corpse like an XXL suitcase. Problem solved.
- At cross map section, drag one corpse at each entrance. Take a few minutes to repeat picks and dumps. For no-brainer clicking and a final easy TAKE ALL, remember to unload necessities on a third corpse, but always quicksave at the same side of it in case next loading screen brings random mutants or military.

I actually earned some 250K+ before adventuring into the red forest. There were still quite some loots left in two chests in the military base section, but I accidentally kill the Freedom guy the first time i storm into the camp, so no trades in the zone unless I haul them back to the Barkeep. Didn't check any walkthroughs or spoilers so I was totally in the wrong impression that, in such a place named ""Hotel"", in the city of Pripyat, there is probably some kind of a trader out there yes? All the way through the forest and the scorcher quest and finally into Pripyat I was dragging this same captain corpse and dumping everything I looted, RPGs, snipers, all guns and pistols, ammo unloaded, all foods and med-kits and cute artifacts and body parts, everything. Dragging my precious luggage slowly walking in the street of Pripyat is a weird experience. What a loner. But the moment I realize the hotel is but a ruin, and as I double check and learn the fact that from red forest there is NO MORE TRADER in the remaining part of the game, such a heart-sinking news! What am I doing all these for? And till that sad yet funny moment, I suddenly realize that, my suitcase can no longer hold any extra items. There is after all some kind of limit on a corpse's capacity! I made a save, and then tried to take all. The weight reading confirmed that a corpse can hold up to 1000kg. Well, 10kg I cannot move an inch away, but dragging a corpse stuffed with ONE TON of trash no problem comrade. Even funnier thing is that, I can no longer load this quicksave and another closely followed previous one, game simply crashed at loading section. No similar questions asked or solutions to be found online, so I had to load another earlier save to continue to the final game. During the nuclear plant underground I was still playing with suitcase as I was fearingf out of ammo, as earlier in the X16 lab quest I was completely ripped clean to some final 10 bullets upon returning to the safe bunker. But then the final stage with all those teleportation anomalies completely ruined my days as a frenzy looter. Can't complain that my ""Wish Granter"" gave me an ""I want to be rich"" ending. Heard the threshold is a merely 50k for that ending.

""Open world survival"" is a scary tag nowadays because of the tons of bad games that were released in the last years, which is strange since STALKER was released in 2007 and did such a good job that makes you wonder why are today's games so bad

Basically, the game is about a nobody who receives a mission to kill a famous stalker. You roam around this unhospitable place, full of bandits and monsters, and receive a couple of missions from people that are not bad enough to kill you. Not only that, anomalies created by radiation are also around and they will destroy you if you are not careful

You have to play smart - enemies won't hesitate to attack you, they hide behind cover, resources are scarce. Guns and armor have their durability reduced as you use them, which makes them worse, so don't be too attached to them. You can and should loot bodies to get ammo, food, and equipment in better condition

But it has its flaws, the most important one is that the game tries to be a FPS and RPG-like, but guns are incredibly inaccurate and the weapon stats doesn't mean a lot (some early weapons with high accuracy are worse than endgame, lower accuracy ones). So in the beginning, it's hard to fight because your guns are bad, but later on it's still hard because enemies have insane armor. The game basically has you rely on headshotting the bad guys, but weapon inaccuracy makes it a thousand times worse than it should be

Overall, I think this is a game worth playing, but keep in mind that it is as hostile as its world towards the player. There are mods and guides that can help you tweak some of the annoyances and I strongly recommend doing so",1652796227,1652796227,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I shot 3 guys, ran out of ammo, and died again. Made it to a sewer, got shot by 8 guys and died again, and again, and again.

Look. Hard games have a following, else we wouldnt have Dark Souls.

In the middle of crazy 1980s, an unexpected accident happened, resulting in a crysis on a scale unseen before. I mean of course Chernobyl disaster, a nuclear accident considered as the worst in history (and let's hope that the last one that big ever to take place).

Knowing the background of the event from several decades ago is necessary to fully appreciate the effort put into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. Not only GSC Game World succeeded in recreating faithfully Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, but also - or I should say especially - managed to create a game with atmosphere that is really rare to find in the industry. Atmosphere of dread land filled with deadly anomalies, mutants, gloomy landscapes of lands that were once inhabitated, but had to be left in a hurry during the evacuation in 1986. Radioactive Red Forest, underground laboratories, military complexes full of treasures (and enemies)? These locations and many more awaits the player during their journey.

Variety of enemies and weapons makes the whole experience even more immersive. You will find various people during your journey, and some of them are going to be hostile towards the player. Apart from them, there are many various types of mutants (starting from mutated dogs, and ending with mutants capable of using psionic tricks). That's why it is important to wander around unknown places fully-equipped, with good weapons, armor, decent amount of ammunition and medical items. Game offers enough of these items to choose from to fit the way you, as the player, would like to play this game. Not to forget about artifacts that are harder to get, but provide valuable bonuses that might be crucial in some cases. You are playing as a stalker called the Marked One, after all. Your mission is to find and kill a man named Strelok in such dangerous place as the Zone. No one said that it would be an easy task.

What can be said more? This game is a classic, so writing much more stuff won't be necessary. There won't be added anything more than what has been already mentioned in many other reviews. I can only say that I highly recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. It's definitely one of the best and the most original shooters that still, despite being quite old (this game was released in 2007, after all), can bring a lot of fun to many players.

I also recommend checking out many mods that are availble for Shadow of Chernobyl. If you don't like to play with modifications, then I really recommend at least installing Zone Reclamation Project mod. It doesn't change the game much, almost not at all, however it provides a lot of bugfixes.

That being said, I can only add one thing in the end of this review: see you in the Zone, stalker!",1651905709,1651905709,True,2,0,0.517275631427764893,0,True,False,False

It's a half open-world (different areas which unlock in time) survival shooter. You have limited carrying capacity, EVERYTHING has weight, and you constantly need to be on the lookout for radiation and anomalies, which are strange phenomena that will kill you if you do not pay attention. Your mission is simple: ""Kill Strelok"". But on the way to your goal you will find tons of hostile (and not so hostile) factions who will kill you in a heartbeat if you don't pay attention. Seriously, the game is quite brutal from the start and even with high level gear you can die in a moment if you don't look out. But that is also part of the excitement: The thick atmosphere keeps you on your toes at all times.
Furthermore, there is equipment decay, which means that nothing will last forever.... Which is why I'd like you to introduce you to STALKER Complete: It's a mod which - unlike many others - leaves the base game mostly untouched, while improving graphics, fixing bugs, and adding one great feature: The ability to repair equipment. That way, you can keep your favourite items as long as you like without ever having to worry about losing them. I highly recommend it, as it greatly enriches the experience of the game (Of course, if you're into this sort of thing, you can still install the mod but ignore the repair feature).

But what it does have is a sense of atmosphere and fear that's hard to beat, resulting in your butthole being thoroughly clenched for a good chunk of the game. In the above ground sections, the mix of enemies and anomalies will keep you on your toes, and when you venture underground or into dark science labs, the game kicks it up a notch by becoming pure and effective horror. The sense of mystery draws you into the story, and never lets up.

Depending on the difficulty you play in, this isn't a game where you can carelessly approach combat encounters, otherwise you will die repeatedly. I played on Stalker (a.k.a. Normal) and had to adjust by being methodical and careful with my approach, using cover smartly, engaging one enemy at a time. Resources can become scarce if you're careless.

In fact, my main criticism was that towards the end, when you enter the point of no return, if you're low on healing and radiation-curing items like I was, the last section of the game becomes a real nightmare to deal with. What could have taken a well stocked player maybe 30 minutes to an hour to beat, took me nearly 3 hours of trial and error.

TLDR:
spoopy shooter with horror elements, exploring and shooting through areas with weird anomalies.

STALKER was a lot of fun playing. i idnt rly know what to expect but i was surprised at how scary and immersed i was in the world. Running from camp to camp with people playing music at bonfires. exploring areas that activle try to kill me and collecting loot along the way to sell so i can buy new resources. 
This game reminded me of FEAR 1 which i played as a child, STALKER brought back child toco and made me feel helpless against the unknown in the zone. i will never forget the first time entering X-18, one of the highlights of the game which make it one of my personal favorites now. The sounds of the guns and the world around you are rly good.

One tip tho - if you want to, get a mod that increases your maximum weight capacity. i didnt do it for this game but if the other ones have it i will probably do it because it's a bit annoying.

Great game get it while its on sale and atleast explore X-18, if you still dont have fun with the game - drop it, if not have fun

Pros: 
The AI in this game is nothing like I have experienced before. The enemy are smart and unpredictable. At times they swarm you and at other times they are sneaky and will wait until you pass them. They don't kill easy. Head shots are best. 
Has a good story line, but that is subjective to the player.
Plenty of supplies abound . You're going to need them. 
Has a fast save feature so one doesn't have to redo the entire sequence. Gonna need those too. Save often. 
Alone those lines, you can save multiple saves and if you don't like the progress, can go back to the auto saves.
Cons
Poor weapons to start. Have to come quite a distance before you get some decent ones. 
You have a weight limit so you will be dumping a lot. 
Too many side missions to distract and some are on timers.
I got spoiled on fast travel locations. There are none here. There are levels and when one has to return to a specific place they will be fighting their way back. Gets tedious. 
The PDA and Map could be better. Hard to follow.

All in all, not bad. Mostly because it was on sale and runs well on my older graphics card. 4 out of 5 for me.

Graphics: For a 15 yr old game its pretty ight

Gameplay: Gunplay is literally hit or miss but the loop is fun and interesting when you get into mid game with artifact hunting

World/world building: 10/10, amazing etc

Lore: Very interesting, leaves you theorizing and interested the entire time

I could go on but I highly recommend you experience this game and its sequels (Even Clear Sky which is a good game imo)

I played using the zrp mod (which mainly fixes bugs in the vanilla game without altering it), and yet in my 21 hours of gameplay I spent a not trivial amount of time trying to work around several problems.
The first major problem I encountered was that trying to start a new game would crash at the starting cutscene EVERY SINGLE TIME. I tried looking for solutions online (none worked), tried skipping it (crash), tried removing the mod (it got even worse), and in the end I managed to 'clear' the first cutscene by playing around with the graphic settings and finding a configuration that did not lead to a crash.
The second major problem occurred every time I started the game for the first time in a gaming session and loaded a savefile (all savefiles had this problem). The game would appear to be 'fine' for a few seconds, then the game freezes and crashes shortly after. I found no actual solution to this problem other than restarting the game an average of 3 to 4 times, after which the game managed to survive without crashing, allowing me to play it for as long as I didn't close it (in which case I would have to repeat the cycle of start->crash->restart again up to 4 times).
These 2 were the major problems I encountered. There were also some minor problems (enemies attempting to shoot you through walls when there is clearly no line of sight, an npc that you have to escort that decides to get stuck on a door and at the same time 'jams' that very door with his own body making it impossible to go back inside and help him out, a few occasions of the audio bugging out, etc...), but these are 'manageable' at least.
You might ask me, after all of these problems, why am I recommending the game if I had such a bad time with it? The answer is: it is worth it. 
I love this type of game.
The game encourages you to be precise with your shots, to not be a loot goblin (limited amount of inventory space + big debuff in stamina consumption if you carry a bit more than the limit), and to progress in the game (better gear and artifacts the more you go north). I actually think that the secondary optional missions are almost always superfluous since you get much better rewards by just progressing in the main story and they don't seem to add anything to the plot.
The story is peculiar and made me go from 'weird' to 'crazy stuff' to 'wtf is going on' by the end.
I love the mood that many locations have, especially the 'darker' ones (I don't want to spoil anything).
I give this game a nice 7.5/10. Without all the bugs it would have been much better.",1650583732,1650584207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Copides and pasted from the modpack webpage:

the mod contains the following:

- OGSR x64 engine for enhanced GFX and performance (Note: the mod uses an older version currently).
- Zone Reclamation Project for further bug fixes.
- Absolute Nature texture pack.
- Absolute Structures texture pack.
- Photorealistic Zone 2 texture pack.
- Original Weapons Renewal 3 for better weapon animations, textures and models.
- STALKER Weather Overhauled v3 for enhanced atmosphere and climate.

+ a number of tweaks, additions and personal fixes (for example, working EAX without the need for a sound card! Try it out, its great).

In addition, there are various Gameplay, Sound and Visual addons available in the Optional folder for you to customize the experience further to your taste. Want to be as vanilla as possible? Going for your first playthrough? The base install will suit you just fine! The only optional I would suggest then is the Clear sky Sidorovich. Otherwise, it's all up to you!

But it's a solidly fun survival-light/sci-fi/horror/shooter with pretty satisfying gun play. You take missions from various other Stalkers, from primary missions to small jobs like clearing out mutants from an area or finding items and returning them. There are even some dynamic missions that can appear during travel, such as helping out a Stalker camp under siege by bandits. All of this building toward one of seven different possible endings. Meanwhile you traverse the maps and scrounge around for loot (and there's quite a bit of it), and manage inventory.

I think the thing that makes this game special is the thing you see a lot of people mentioning: Atmosphere. It's gloomy, desolate. Gray clouds often rolling across the horizon. Sometimes you hear the call of a mutated creature in the distance, or a man screaming and gunshots popping. The music is low key and really lends to that atmosphere. During underground missions/exploration, the game can become full-fledged horror.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",1650498568,1650498568,True,19,11,0.657796204090118408,1,True,False,False

Normal mode feels like what Nightmare mode would be on most games in the genre and while I thoroughly embrace a challenge, Stalker is all unfair and no fun.

You don't really notice it in ""dungeons"" when it's only you and a couple of enemies at a time but even then the enemy AI can (and will!) spot you from miles away and hit you with pinpoint accuracy (even behind cover!) when the weapons they're using (which you can later grab) cannot hit a sitting boulder if it's farther than ten inches away when you are wielding them.

Upgraded weapons, 500% health increase through anomalies, sturdy armor - all the RPG mechanics available at your disposal and enemies will still nearly one-shot you from far away if they score a headshot, even when you're behind cover. Then you can empty an entire magazine on a single enemy, aiming for the head and you're lucky if that kills one of them.

Again, this is not all the time but [i]so many[/i] areas of this game, both mandatory and optional, are you against a dozen enemies coming at you sometimes two at a time, sometimes all of them in a wave or two - this is when the AI cheating becomes painfully obvious and you need to cheese a fight by using a dozen bandages and med-kits while in active combat. The game will make the baffling decision of sometimes giving you like, two friendly allies - who every time will go down within 20 seconds of an enemy wave showing up.

It's terrible. This is fine as a Nightmare mode but not Normal mode, even for someone like me who in 2 hours of play got a whole bunch of some of the rarest Steam Achievements in a popular arena-shooter on Steam - and while sure, Stalker is much more of a slow-paced military shooter than an arena-shooter, my complaint here is not about the difficulty but the inherent advantage (cheating) the AI has even when you have better weapons, armor and artifacts, while you have to fight against dozens of AI units on your own, frankly all of the time.

Some of these areas are optional, yes but Stalker is a largely linear game so these optional areas are meant to be balanced for your current gear, not something you ""keep in mind"" and come back to later on when you're stronger. This isn't an open-world game. And, again many aren't optional and the gameplay and balance is still the very same. It gets tiring very quickly.

The aesthetic of the game hit close to home for me and the graphics and soundtrack do their job more then well-enough to deliver one-of-a-kind ambiance to put Bethesda's Fallout games to utter shame. The problem is that it's all skin-deep: NPCs serve only as bullet sponges and item buyers; lore comes at a paragraph-worth for each 10 hours of play; the world is dull and void (which borders on parody once you start opening containers in any area that has them, only to find literally all of them completely empty).

If Bethesda Fallouts feel hollow compared to the Black Isle Fallouts, Stalker feels hollow even compared to the former. At least Fallout 3 and 4 have unique, interesting locations with great care put into environmental storytelling and even easter eggs - sure there's a lot of filler and reused assets but Stalker's world feels like the cutting-room floor of Bethesda's content. While the ambiance is sublime, realistic and dark, the world itself is a barren and ugly wasteland.

The most you get out of the world are scavenger hunts you unlock when looting certain enemies - and that's great, really but it fails miserably as an alternative for an interesting world with unique locations and mechanics to discover. Artifacts (anomalies) are literally scattered on the ground by the side of the road. Very few are placed intelligently in a way to reward world exploration and almost all that are, are just the hidden stashes that I mention.

With only combat as the ""fully-fledged"" content here, the complete lack of proper balance hurts that much more. If the combat was serviceable I would recommend the game for the world exploration alone but with one being deeply flawed and the other being terribly shallow, there really isn't anything here for anyone looking for actual substance to sink their teeth into.

And if someone says ""what about the horror"", I am literally going to scream. Stalker can be tense and dark and moody but it's not a horror game, it's a military shooter going through an edgy phase, is all. Resident Evil and Silent Hill could get my hands to shake and force me to take a break to catch my breath - Stalker can give you a scare or two but in general it can't even up my heartbeat in its darkest moments... except maybe in the befuddlement  of restarting a gunfight for the twentieth time when only luck, not skill or tactics, will decide whether I win or not against normal-mode AI that are better at FPS than any human I've dueled.",1650172043,1650175802,False,1,0,0.346938788890838623,4,True,False,False

It's a good game, I enjoyed it.  It is a bit rough around the edges, which is understandable since it's the beginning of the series made by a small studio back in the 2000s.  It feels sort of like if Fallout 1 was made into a 3D title, while not as deep in terms of dialogue choices.  I really wish you could get some kind of backpack to increase carry weight, because I found myself constantly going over the carry limit. Even on Stalker difficulty, which is this game's ""normal,"" you die very quickly.  Weapons operate realistically and have very poor accuracy.  Your weapon will jam after you've hit an enemy with a couple of shots, and they will blast you in the face with no remorse to punish this.  Most of the time that's fun, sometimes it's really annoying depending on how much patience you have to keep reloading that quick save.  Thankfully, the game doesn't overstay its welcome if you're just doing the main story, so this hardcore difficulty won't become a migraine if you're a seasoned gamer.

The story's ending went right over my head.  I thought I understood generally where it was going, but the end cutscene throws a curveball and I really didn't understand what it meant.  I feel like a bit of a dunce but they really don't spell it out to you.  I'm honestly not sure if this is due to poor writing or because I missed something.  To YouTube I go! ------ Edit: I wasn't aware there were multiple endings until I looked into it.  Apparently I got the ""you did too well"" ending, which is kind of funny in retrospect but also a bit weird since the ending is received as punishment for being wealthy.  I don't like that the true ending was hidden from me just because I had a certain quantity money (about 100k).  I mostly stuck to looting, only buying ammo in a pinch. The game doesn't really push that saving money is bad.  If anything, it encourages it.  Weapons and armor are extremely expensive, and the goal of a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is to find wealth and riches.  So, that gets thumbs down from me despite it being cheeky with proper context.

The game's levels are well crafted, especially [spoiler] Pripyat and Chernobyl Power Plant [/spoiler].  Walking through those areas was really, really cool.

If you have the patience for hardcore FPS gameplay where you die a lot, I'd recommend S.T.A.L.K.E.R for its great atmosphere and engaging world. Just remember to practice thorough save scumming.",1649910038,1649948442,True,0,0,0.489239096641540527,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, this is among the best games I've played, reminds me of New Vegas in a way, if New Vegas looked even more dated in vanilla. I would recommend using some texture mods, there's a guide on here somewhere to show you how. Note that Steam does break a few of them and may cause the game to not start. Scary mutants, excellent atmosphere, mystery, janky mechanics, and a few bugs.

All in all, a timeless classic I would recommend to anyone interested in games like Fallout.

It's extremely fun and well worth the full price they ask, but even better on sale. Here's the TLDR breakdown, tho i haven't beaten it yet, I feel like I am at least half way thru.

Pros:
- surprisingly immersive
- interesting story
- Classic weaponry 
- RPG like in that you can play like a jerk or a hero who solves all the people's problems
- Huge Modding community
- PC controls feel great and required minimal set up or keybinding

Cons:
- Weapons are very inaccurate early on but later weapons do/feel much better
- Autosave frequency is ludicrously spaced out so make your own saves, there is a quicksave/load
- I had 1 crash and 1 game breaking bug so far (dropped a piece of armor and it shoved me, trapped into the floor) both only set me back a few minutes so take that how you will
- older graphics but if this is a deal breaker on a fun game than are you really a gamer?

All in all a very fun game that's well worth the $20 or whatever they ask and even better for $5 or whatever I paid (terrible memory + zero fact checking = 100% accurate as far as I can tell). Seriously tho any cons I can get over and I can't wait to play more of this, the other 2 older titles in the bundle, and Stalker 2 coming out Dec/2022.",1649656848,1649656848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An absolute classic, even over a decade later I can still find myself repeatedly drawn back into this trilogy. It might be janky, and the graphics might be dated by today's standards, but hell if it doesn't cook up some great atmosphere and fun, sufficiently challenging gameplay. There's fun gunplay, surprise firefights, environmental anomalies beyond physical description, creatures twisted by an omniscient psychic alien force, a sky that wants you dead, and this is all not even mentioning the lore and storytelling which pays homage to the classic science fiction novel Roadside Picnic. If you are a fan of horror, PVE, shooters, and science fiction, don't hesitate to throw the guys at GSC a few bucks. You will not regret it.

Now i can say this game aged very good and its great to run it on todays hardware and it runs without any problem on Windows10. 
Highly recommended and there is not many games out there like this one. 
Controls are less tanky and graphics are much better then Fallout. 
Use quicksave allot if you dont wanna lose allot of progress because the game does tend to crash once in a while just like it always did back in the days. 
Also because of the hardware back in those days it was very laggy and janky to play it and now it really is the way it was meant to be played and much more fluid and enjoyable with full antialiasing and max anisotropic filtering it actually is a beautiful game for its time and still pretty damn creepy at moments.

I nearly gave up the first quarter of the game simply because the story moves super slowly and is pretty dull. Sticking with the outdated gameplay and graphics was well worth it as I approached the half way mark. 

STALKER is an amazing game well worth the trouble of putting up with. I fell in love with the mechanics as I realized I am supposed to be suffering with inventory management and not in a Bethesda like way. This game tries to mix fantasy with reality and does both super well.

I highly recommend playing STALKER if you're looking for a compelling universe, story and gameplay to immerse yourself into. Supposedly the game can be completed in 8 hours though it took me 44. Perhaps some of that could have been idling or my dilly dallying with optional side quests. The side quests are pretty pointless unless you enjoy the mechanics of the gun fights. You won't need them for cash as the game provides you plenty of loot along the way.

After playing it I can see why it's so beloved, and it's so impressive to think something like this came out in 2007. I'm also going to be putting it down after 4 hours, because I can also see just how much games have improved in 15 years. The UI is wonky, the AI is silly, and the gun-play is unresponsive. 

Worst of all, and probably the gravest sin any game can commit - the danger in the world is unexplained and ethereal. Of course I know to avoid the [spoiler]giant floating mystical wizard-like weird-orb-thingies that make my screen go fuzzy and beep and then explode and hurt me, but I don't know what they are or why they're there (besides a vague presumption of[b] super spooky [/b]radiation even though they don't set off your geiger counter).[/spoiler] What just ended my fun was a very interesting interaction with a [spoiler]humanoid entity at the end of a tunnel that blocked my path, did 1/3rd my hp in damage every 3 seconds by putting me into a repeating cutscene of zooming in on its (ironically ethereal) face, and appeared to be immune to bullets... [/spoiler] although in fairness, most enemies in this game act like they're immune to bullets until they just spontaneously drop to the ground dead. I died and reloaded about 4 times, dying the same way with zero indication from the game of what I was doing wrong or what I should do to either get past the enemy or kill it before I realized I hadn't had fun in about 30 minutes.

The world, even if destroyed and barren, is full of life. Sitting amidst the fire and listening to a Stalker play the guitar gave me the unique feeling that this experience is, mostly, about those moments.

[u]Story:[/u] Main storyline will take 10 hours to get through, but there are also plenty of optional side quests (mostly cash rewards) that can consume hours, as well as sheer hours spent on exploration in atmospheric, immersive world.
[u]Gameplay:[/u] The game slides between post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller, nerve-singing survival horror shooter with very realistic weapons and exploration of abandoned territories as well as complicated human behavior keeping you constantly in a state of hesitant wonder.
[u]Graphics:[/u] The graphics, though dated in places, builds a sense of enchanting mystique of realistic post-apocalyptic surroundings. Very realistic sunrises, rainstorms, and NPC battles occurring outside the sphere of player involvement produce a disarming atmospheric cohesiveness. Attention to detail in all the game's cityscapes and fields triggers a subtle sense of familiarity.
[u]Sound/Music/Voice:[/u] Sounds are quite good, particularly the startling cries of the various mutants and the piercing ambient howls that float across The Zone from time to time. Weapon sounds do a great job of immersing you in the environment, effectively conveying a sense of the firearms' power. You'll find unexpected extras packed in as well, most notably a surprising amount of guitar songs and jokes that you can hear when you sit with other NPC stalkers in front of a flaming barrel.

[u]Optimization:[/u] Good (old game), runs well on low-end PC.
[u]Bugs:[/u]  Some bugs, crashed a few times.

[u]Singleplayer:[/u] Yes (solo only).
[u]Multiplayer:[/u] Not worth it (very unpopular).
[u]Player Count:[/u] Low.
[u]Pay to Win:[/u] No (no DLC, no lootboxes, no microtransactions).

Playing on Win10, I had to pick the beta (1.007) to be able to use the mouse and keyboard in the menu, and had to install the ZRP mod (Zone Reclamation Project) in order to fix some annoyances. The first and last levels are ridiculous in terms of difficulty, but the other parts are way more balanced. This is mostly because you start with awful weapons that can barely hit or kill anything, and the last level suffers from ""we gotta make the last level hard and intense"" syndrome. Despite all this, it's a fun and atmospheric game, very reminiscent of Fallout, F.E.A.R. and Half-Life.",1648810629,1648810629,True,1,0,0.503731369972229004,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere is oozing and the gunplay is janky at first but really tightens up when you spend your life savings on a gun that shoots 7.62x54 rounds (SVU for this kid) and a handgun that shoots .45 rounds (USP). 

If your having trouble with muddy textures and bugs then get the starter pack mod. It has the zone reclamation project installed which fixes the issues and provides a smooth experience. 0 CTD on my playthrough. 

Long story short: if you like RPG type exploring games with a tactical edge then play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 

Ps, I'm playing on Master and it keeps the tension high. Luckily you always die from mistakes you've made and not stupid B.S. (screw you Souls types auto tracking). Take things slow when enemies are on your map, use the lean feature in cover and death should be a rare occurrence. The A.I. can't seem to aim that well when you're not standing in the open.

4500,113138996,76561197976660016,0,13,39689,0,3382,1707542392,"An extremely engaging and exciting game that gives you a lot of options, although somewhat random, for different weapons and playstyles. It gets better as you progress, but it can be a bit overwhelming or underwhelming depending on the situation. I will say it's a hard game to follow the story of and is non-linear for most of it's gameplay until the end when you get forced to commit to the story and then have no way to realistically go back and retrace your steps like in the old game. It's kind of annoying that it throws a lot of stuff at you you can't expect, like randomly enemies with psionic powers that never come back in the game, or random situations you have to memorize but will never need to understand again, and situations with seemingly unlimited amounts of enemies you can barely fight through out of nowhere. Things just... sort of happen in the game and you have to deal with it. Make sure to save and save often as you can die from as little as one hit in this game even with the best armor.  

Monolith by the end is an exciting challenge, but it's obnoxious in that you don't get a chance to get more ammunition, get new armor or move backwards, with moving backwards more or less killing you with radiation or sheer numbers of guys, and the fact the game expects you to move forwards, so you are stuck finishing the game on whatever you brought. It's really frustrating in many ways in that ammunition hardly ever drops and you find yourself either getting the wrong ammunition, or not enough and are always just scraping by, and if you store up a lot of ammunition you run in to weight issues. You learn to hope to find supplies along the way, but man the game gives you just enough to complete it which is hair-splitting, and too much in other areas. It's also a bit annoying that certain options are never explored, for example there is only one SMG and one of the most common ammunition types in the game, or 9mm makarov, is useless outside of a few pistols rather than a makarov submachine gun showing up. It would be really simple to combine 9mm makarov or 9mm parabellum ammunition together as the same ammunition which would also be realistic as the russians eventually switched to 9mm x 19mm as their main ammunition, and having to sift between 5.45mm which dissapears entirely and then comes back right at the end is more than a little frustrating. I left my best 5.45mm rifle behind and could never go back and get it which had me pulling my hair out the whole time. The game forces you to carry everything you need but gives you no vehicle or cart or something to carry it, which is annoying. You can also only sell weapons to three vendors in the game which makes it hard to grind. It's overall very tedious and time consuming to get certain things done in the game while others are lightning fast. You end up losing access to a certain type of ammunition choice in the game, only for it to come back in huge droves and you lose access to what you just switched to with no idea this would happen, meaning your stockpiling of resources is basically useless, and you end up having to fight an insanely huge amount of guys. 

The weight limit is both the most fun and frustrating part of the game. It's an exhilarating experience, but only in that you are always just around the corner for death and are fighting tooth and nail the whole time. I wouldn't change it ,but I will admit it had me extremely frustrated, more than other games at certain points. Most the bugs seem to be worked out in the game and I think the updates have done this. I'd like to explore all the options in an easier format with more time, which is why it's a bit painful you don't get to do this. By the end, it's actually a bit disappointing. It's also annoying the game changes things on you with no notice. All in all, I'd have to say it's one of my favorite survival-horror games of all times, with a very realistic and fun feel to the combat that's honestly very fresh, and with a lot of weapons and equipment and a lot to explore in the game. I imagine you could play it through a few times and still not find hidden goodies that barely pop up in the game. All in all, I'd give a positive review, but make sure you you know what you're getting in to, it is a very, very frustrating and addicting game, which will make you go through hours of it in the first week.

One of, if not THE buggiest game I have ever played.
I like the setting of the game.. If it wasnt so buggy it would be amazing.
Instead im going back and forth from enjoying myself to the pit of rage.

#1. Guns have bent barrels. You can literally fire off 30 bullets and not hit any of them where you aim. (I am now further in the game and have a pinpoint accurate VSS, so maybe the inacurracy is intended)

#2. Got to a 'save an NPC, and then get him to safety' quest (I hate you Kruglov) where the NPC is so bugged he will not move.. ever.. apparently he has like 6+ ways to get bugged.. I got atleast 4 of them.

#3. Atleast you can kill that NPC and move on, and get a new NPC... Who will then bug the same way..(Hate you too Semenov)

Spent hours trying to get past the buggy NPC's.. ended up just killing them, and failing the quests so I could move to the next ones.

#4. You can download a mod (ZRP) that is supposed to fix bugs and stuff.. so far only seen it make medkits, Bandages and radmeds be 1/4 as good as they used to be, and take off 10 of max carry weight... It does add some nice music and remove NPC's saying same things over and over..

Oh and ofc now I cant remove the mod again coz then the saves wont load. xD

#5. Enemy humans can see you through entire map (if line of sight)

#6. 1 attempt at stealth. If you get spotted and reload you are still spotted, and the ones you killed are back.",1645645157,1648163640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is a post-apocalyptic after explosion on Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant ,CNPP. Bringing moody, survival  and no chance to bring humanity back.  video game also about a guy who lost his memory and found around a death truck, doing his mission to kill a guy named Strelok from his PDA..  

THE GOOD

The story is great, it brings multiple endings based on the way you play. The atmosphere is logical where science friction and modern met after the explosion in real life reactor number four CNPP. To make this game more interesting, around 2006 the second explosion occurred due to secret experiments from laboratories around the exclusion zone. Anomalies can be found here. A articats brings you power and more value than your life. Since then, The people who were in the zone called themselves as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  They are doing it for money, for a specific purpose or to make a new life here. At least weapons still use bullets to kill people instead of lasers in 2006. There are a lot of secrets that are hidden and never been told unless you figure it out by yourself. Basically a  door that brings you to explore more about the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Series. 

THE BAD 

Bugs, it is necessary to install mod. At least to reduce instability and bugs in the game.. ZRP mod is recommended.  Enough said.


THE UGLY

The gunplay is hard, you’ll die more even though on easy mode. It's necessary to have high end weapons and armour to beat many enemies especially on the final mission. Overpowered  gear is not a sin but crucial. Your enemies will kill you no matter what you did even though both of you are fighting against mutants. You’ll easily fatigue because of the horde. It is not a zombie horde, but deadly mutants and enemies. It is not weird when you are fighting more than 20 enemies at the same location and fighting it again at different locations after escaping from that horde location. Let's say, you are escaping Agroprom after fighting a military attack and going to Agroprom underground, you will fight another attack from a group of Bandit and Bloodsuckers. Be sure to mentally and physically prepared before jumping in this game. 

CONCLUSION 
The game is wonderful, I recommend this game if you are interested on survival first person shooter genre. 

TIPS 

Collect as much as possible the artifacts around anomalies, stashes and do optional tasks to get more money. Sells artifacts to Professor Sakharov in Yantar Bunker. Then, buy an exoskeleton suit or any equivalent suit from barkeep and use some artefacts to gain advantages before entering Pripyat . Get weapons from dead Freedom, Duty or Monolith to get high end ammo and guns. Pickup gauss rifle if possible. Do guide mission and doctor mission then follow up those missions to get a good ending. Loot for each dead body.

For reasons I'll never quite understand this game isn't for everyone. The good thing is though, you'll know within 10 minutes if The Zone is for you or if you're an idiot. Buy it and give it a shot.

This game has an omnipresent atmosphere that's heavy and foreboding yet not overly oppressive... you'll never want to escape this game, let's put it that way. It's very balanced in that regard. You feel isolated and in danger most of the time but also at peace, surrounded by beautiful places to explore. You can play at your own pace and approach most situations from multiple angles. It isn't a huge open world, but a series of interconnected areas that are big and varied enough to make you feel small. With no vehicles or fast travel you are encouraged to explore, which is good, because there is plenty going on in The Zone without it feeling crowded. There are also lots of weapons and items to find that actually offer a pretty varied experience, so take your time and look around. Check anomalies and talk to people. You will have no trouble looking for (or avoiding) fights and there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy. The weather and time cycles keep it varied too.

Enemy AI is actually pretty good with use of cover and lots of movement. You'll find that you're being flanked quite often if you don't maintain situational awareness. There are mechanics you can take advantage of, sure, but overall the combat is engaging and fun. Taking cover, having good aim, and ammo management are important. Luckily you can loot bodies.

Don't expect cutting edge graphics. Rather, soak up the charm of the dated visuals because they were done right with plenty of foliage, decent lighting, and excellent building models and textures. Take in the whole picture and it's beautiful from beginning to end. I recommend playing it vanilla your first time, save for one mod: Increased grass draw distance. After that I recommend re-playing with Autumn Aurora 2.1 as it improves the overall appearance, doesn't change the core game much, and performs very well.",1625611992,1647113744,True,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

I wanted to play it again, then i actually managed to end it, and even do the secret door ending plus the portal secret ending. This game is pretty good for being over 14 years old now, and i hope for the best for Ukraine, and hope the best for the civilians during these difficult times.

8/10 Vanilla

Cons: A few voice bugs commonly seen like ""Get out of here stalker!"" and ""Don't stand there, i said come in!"",
wiped the whole town of security with a single ak and corner choke point, reached supreme luxury and more cash i ever wanted by collecting every gun the security had like tundra -->(it's a con in my opinion)<--. This happened because the whole town was agressive against me for some reason, i dont exactly know why (maybe because i interacted with other clans) but i know that everytime i was done doing a mission and had to stock up on ammo i can not go to the trader without killing 20 guards, there was no way to make them friendly again either (atleast what i know of).

Game gets a little weird sometimes like when you shoot a guy with semi-auto shotgun and acts like he feels nothing and he cant even see you. Quests can get screwed up, like an example the green marker of ""Enter lab x16"" quest never goes away, and if very unlucky the quest can get so screwed up that you can't proceed in any way and you have to start a new game.

Rubber bullets.


Pros: Cheeki Breeki

Very cool guns, that follow how accurate it is, dmg, fire rate and more. 

Rare artifacts that can give you huge advantage if lucky, like unlimited running endurance with low downside or %30 protection against electric shock with no down sides. Of course you can also equip multiple (up to five), this can for example have artifacts that counters each others downsides.

Graphics, for being 2007 very good but most importantly it gives much atmosphere to the game, good sound plus details (like rain.)
Sometimes you can meet other stalkers around a campfire and hear them speak about jokes in Ukrainian and a guy with guitar playing his songs with the boys, over all the game makes you feel included.
The modding community has also reached far since the devs havent released any new stalker games since now almost 15 years, and has been delayed like crazy. If you have completed the game and want more content in that game i suggest getting mods, these mods get intense in a good way, they add so much more to the game. if you dont want to play modded, there are 2 more stalker games (not as popular) which is a sequel to this.



The story of the game is basically your choice, you are found almost dead and a few people find you. You suffer from amnesia and you get introduced to a guy named Sidrovich. Sidrovich noticed that you have a PDA that has one main task, which is to kill a stalker named ""Strelok"", you dont know who he is but you will ""find"" him along the way while you fight off bandits, military and mutants, to either protect your self or/and your buddies.",1645894318,1645894318,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It actually gets quite scary in some sections.

 The gunplay does look extremely janky and the controls are quite cumbersome, and it is, but trust me, as soon as you get the hang of things, this game gets very intense during some gunfights in old ruins and underground exploration skirmishes.

Set the game to highest difficulty. It makes accuracy higher or all the weapons in the game, which makes it a bit more manageable. What's seen as the lowest difficulty is actually the hardest difficulty, because you have the hardest time hitting anything.

The mechanics are very realistic mechanically. (not visually. This game came out in 2007 after all.)
Get used to crouching behind cover, leaning out of corners to avoid enemy fire, compensate for bullet drop for targets over long distances, and tossing grenades around dark corridors to get rid of potential human and supernatural threats. 

Play slowly. Tactically. Assess potential threats from a distance with your binoculars. Always keep a plan in your enemy before, during, and after skirmishes. Grab weapons from enemy corpses and unload them, you are going to need the extra ammunition as resources are scarce in the Zone. Simply being inside of the Zone gives you a feeling of dread unlike any other place you've been to. As you explore it, you will see some things, horrific entities and anomalies that will question your will to keep pressing forward to Pripyat.

This game is really fun, but it's also quite repetitive. This is somewhat deterred by the excellent AI. The AI being smart (when GSC's dynamic A-Life AI isn't bugging out), makes for some really dynamic and engrossing combat situations. Sometimes, when you kill something and leave for a little while, you'll see a dog or a mutant from a nearby nest feasting and dragging that corpse along the ground. Sometimes, after killing a patrolling enemy soldier on the road, the military outpost will send small groups of soldiers along the road to try and find you. Sometimes, after killing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S in a certain area, you'll see a lot more bandits in that area afterwards, they might even take over that old ruin that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S were bunkered down at.

The AI was groundbreaking for the time, absolutely, there's no doubt about it, but the gameplay hardly has very much variety aside from getting into exploring, getting into gunfights, and getting the crap scared out of you occasionally.

Hopefully, S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 improves on the variety aspect for gameplay with GSC's A-Life 2.0 AI and a few more mechanics that make the game a bit deeper.

The Marked One had made it all the way to the ""special ending"" - a scene as romantic as it was welcoming (so, not at all), and after defeating countless foes, finally thought he had cracked the code and everything, kind of, was starting to make sense. The mysterious being spoke so much sense, and the Marked One, with every word, felt like his life was changing.

Unfortunately for the Marked One, it was not due to being enlightened by his newfound knowledge.

Instead, it was due to hunger.

That's right, the Marked One had neglected to eat before ""the grand speech"" that this mysterious being was granting him, and, with no previous ""save point"", the Marked One had a perilous challenge. Could he make it through all of what was the mysterious being was saying, before meeting an untimely fate due to starvation?

Well unfortunately the answer is: no. The Marked One could not and this became the sad fate of one of the most talented men to ever grace The Zone. He had faced countless Monolith, bandits, Military and hordes of mutants, but it was this chamber that the Marked One would call his final resting place. The talking and hunger were simply too much.



In conclusion, if you're looking for a great wasteland survival simulator set in a period of artifact hoarding and sausage bartering, this is the game for you. 

You can figure out for yourself if you like the graphics and audio or not, I have no problems with either. If you won't be playing with all of the artifacts that boost your speed, and a combat shotgun, be prepared for a less fun time (and if you don't spam antirads and hotdogs while running through extremely radioactive areas, are you really playing?).

Plus, the AI loves to swarm you shotgun wielding aimbots, so be prepared to sit and cower behind an explosive barrel while the oddly hench Controller mutant arrives. Don't worry, you'll learn to stonye boosh and throw screws into anomalies in no time...you did remember to take cover before quicksaving while in a blowout, right?

Shadow of Chernobyl is a cult classic for those who dig the Russian/Ukrainian aesthetics coupled with some minor RPG and survival elements. Visually the game can be dated looking and same applies to the feeling of the game with it's controls and UI. To many new stalkers the game might come off as very weird, unappealing, or boring to people who start out for the first time. The atmosphere and world has a slow way of drawing you in slowly until you're deep into the game and it's setting.

The setting and atmosphere is definitely the strongest thing this game has. You explore the outskirts of Pripyat and the notorious Chernobyl NPP after a strange second disaster happens and alters the world and defies both science and reality itself with Anomalies and artifacts. The world is fairly decent sized and split into sectors. You'll explore most of them multiple times. The underground labs are probably some of the most horrifying experiences I've had in a long time with the sound design and darkness. 

The gameplay is probably the weakest part of the whole experience. Guns have a tendency to be inconsistent but scoped weapons reign supreme due to how long range engagements can me along with seeing where your bullet went. Bodyshots are easily shrugged off by even lowly bandits so headshots are essentially a must to win. Mutants on the other hand are either weak or bullet sponges. The player character no matter what difficulty is weak. You might have to resort to abundant use of quicksaves and some save scumming since the game is fairly difficult in some sections.

The economy in this game is fairly brutal meaning you'll have to do some jobs and grinding by taking artifacts, loot, and risking your own life to make small amounts of cash only to save up and blow it all on buying that expensive ass new suit with exoskeleton support that looks awesome. Different traders offer different prices for specific items, such as the ecologist paying top dollar for any artifacts or mutant pieces you bring them. However everything has durability meaning when you purchase anything be ready to chuck it away or sell the broken gear for a mere fraction of what you payed for before. The game is also not very friendly to loot hoarders with bullets and all other things that go into your inventory taking up weight. The game punishes you for stocking up on too much gear (such as having like 1000 extra AK rounds) you do not need basically forcing you to take the bare essentials.

Now let me get into the artifacts. These are a staple of the game's experience and what really makes this game from shiny silver to absolute gold. Artifacts are found in stashes you find locations for or inside an anomaly which will instantly eviscerate your character. These things are high risk high reward and you can easily find them with the naked eye. Not all artifacts are good or sell for much. A number of them are pretty much junk artifacts that irradiate your character or offer very little benefit however when you find something like maybe 4 moonlight artifacts you can pretty much sprint infinitely even when you're carrying too much. Some items can effect different aspects of the gameplay such as stopping bleeding, increased resistances, increased health, and radiation removal. A lot of these do come with downsides such as emitting radiation, making you weaker to specific attacks, and overall increasing the bleed out rate.

The story in this game is basically next to non-existent. Like it's there but at the same time it's really nothing special. I know I said the gameplay is the weakest part but I think I take that back now. There are 2 main endings with the one having sub endings based on what you did and yes there is a true canon ending if you go out of your way to figure it out.

NO FAST TRAVEL. Expect to do some walking and rationing your gear alongside avoiding fights from point A to point B if you have to.

I'd say S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl is a must play game. It might not be for everyone but it is definitely one of the best for what it is. Also if I find someone who calls this game series Russian Fallout I will borderline hurt them.",1645495533,1645495533,True,30,1,0.743859291076660156,0,True,False,False

It is almost a perfect game for what I want. It has enough depth to not be boring but it isn't overly complex to the point it is overwhelming. 
The atmosphere is amazing and it can be genuinely very scary. There's really no major downsides, save for the bugs, or anomalies, as they say. Thankfully I am yet to have a huge bug, save for some mission objectives not properly showing as completed when I definitely completed the task.

My favorite thing about Stalker is the difficulty scaling. Basically, lower difficulty = more bullets that do less damage. For this reason, I am playing on Master difficulty. It really has not been that hard. Don't let people scare you off with their ravings about the game being too hard. It is hard, you can't play it like call of duty, but you just have to be smarter than your enemies. 
I personally think that a game where many enemies can die in one or two shots is genius. It makes you remember how squishy you and your fellow stalkers are.

I think so... But with caveats...

STALKER is one of those games that you've either already played it, or have always been intrigued to play it. Nobody would ever claim to have been uninterested by the premise.   The problem, as always, is that today we have an overload of survival horror RPG FPS's set in weird and wonderful places. You can play on zombie-infested islands, alien planets, chemical plants, the future, the past, alternative universes and many more. There's even a modern homage called, I think 'Chernobyl'...  So, why go back and play the ageing STALKER?  Quite simply: Curiosity, and the fact that it still stands up as a great game even today.

Firstly, I'll say that the game is large and very detailed for a game from 2007, but looks extremely antiquated now.   The matte textures, though, really allow the core soul of the game to shine through:  You're playing in the wasteland of a nuclear accident, left to rot and accumulate decades of decay.    In that, especially in the later levels set closer [spoiler]and in[/spoiler] to the nuclear power plant itself, it's wondrous to walk around and look at the frozen state of the CCCP of 1986.  Walking around a concrete soviet town, Pripyat, there's a wonderful sense of timeless wonder... How could people live in a concrete town like this?   Having seen East Berlin, it's all too easy to imagine life in Soviet times, dreary, fearful, bland.  

The other levels are also very well designed, and do their best to mask their limited size, placing hills, buildings and so forth in strategic places.   The deserted buildings are dilapidated in exactly the ways you'd expect, and exploring their ruins when surrounded by hostile enemies is extremely nerve wracking, but fun.

The sounds are good, and the game supports surround sound, which is very handy for figuring out where shots are coming from.  In ""easy"" mode, you might get one or two 'free' shots to work out where they are before you're bulls-eyed right between the eyes. In ""normal"" mode, if they see you first, you better be wearing armour, or the first shot will kill.  In hard mode, you need to see them first, or you're toast.     This game is NOT for the faint-hearted.  Even playing on 'easy' mode is a real challenge!     F5 (quicksave) is your friend!

The storyline is quite confusing, and it's very easy to get side-tracked.  There are some sidequests that have some world-altering abilities, such as clearing out an area of hostiles, bringing in friendlies, or making a faction hostile to you.   If you accidentally make a faction hostile you can make life quite hard for yourself.    While a legitimate thing to do in the game, making an enemy of one or both primary factions is tantamount to making it damn hard to finish the game.    It's best to be nice to everyone and not take jobs that are obviously going to annoy a faction.

So,  TL;DR time... What makes STALKER still worthwhile to play in the 2020's... Quite simply, only the STALKER games give you dozens of hours of tense, strategic game play in a setting quite unlike any other series.    It also have multiple endings which are quite well matched to what you do in the game.  

IF STALKER's on sale, grab it, and grab the Zone Reclamation Project mod for it to add quicksaves and level-specific saves, which are handy!

Many mods are available, but vanilla is excellent on its own. Only complaint is the lack of gender diversity. Just a bunch of bros broing with other bros. The game severely penalizes your aim while moving or spraying bullets and improves your aim when you crouch. I was hardly hitting anything until I learned this. Early game is rough so be prepared. You will likely die a lot until you acquire good gear so save often. I started on veteran difficulty but eventually bumped it up to master.

-Play the game on stalker difficulty or higher; any lower and you'll be shooting paper bullets instead of rubber.

-Try to avoid other stalkers until you get a decently lengthy rifle, they'll otherwise cook you like tourist's delight.

-Save. At. Every. Interval. Possible. You don't want to walk that much. Trust me, you don't.

-Max out your pistol ammo at about 600. Ammo weighs you down a lot more than you think it will. (Or don't carry a pistol because it doesn't dent anything stronger than a boar, but i like saving my rifle ammo)

-Only use medkits or bandages in an emergency. Otherwise, eat food or wait to regen.

-Pick up surplus weapons in the first area and sell everything you won't use to Sidorovich, i had 14000 rubles before i left.

-For god's sake, SAVE.

The game is literally unplayable without mods. First off, one of the story missions bugged out for me so it wouldn't progress at all. I could still do the story objective but the objective markers and reminders where still bugged so i had no idea what to do and where to go. Second off the combat is one of the worst things i've played. Enemies are bullet-sponges and your guns have accuarcy so bad that you can't engage targets over 6 meters. Seriously. You cannot hit enemies with assualt rifles from medium-range even if you crouch and tap-fire. It is terrible.

Sure, i might have judged it a bit too hard considering it's a game from 2007 and made by an indie studio
but it's still seen as one of the greatest games and gets so much praise, so i was dissapointed when i played it.

If there is anything i'm missing here then please tell me in the comments because i really don't understand how this game can be given so much praise when it plays like this.

In GSC Game World's long awaited S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, such an experiment in genre cooking has produced some great results. The game offers significantly more content than any other FPS out there, but struggles a little when it comes to the open world. What remains consistent throughout the experience is the compelling atmosphere. The gnarled trees, bleak skies, and rumbling thunderstorms of The Zone grab you firmly by the ears and yank you across irradiated wastelands. In your first hours expect to be filled with an intrepid glee as you acclimate to the game world. A little while later, you'll likely realize the environment's limitations and yearn for more.

Events kick off with your character, known only as the Marked One, tumbling off a death truck on the outskirts of The Zone. You soon meet up with a man named Sidorovich, who hands out your first tasks and introduces the fiction of the environment. As the journey progresses, you'll move through the game's various self-contained zones that together make up The Zone, from the relatively placid Cordon to the war-wracked Army Warehouses, Pripyat, and finally the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself, from which all things sinister seem to emanate.


S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s main story missions provide the most engaging experience, as completing the challenges sometimes bestows useful rewards, opens up new territory to explore, and advances the mysterious plot. It turns out the Zone's NPCs aren't the best storytellers, so to more accurately understand what's happening you'll need to regularly check your PDA; the Marked One turns out to be quite the diligent note taker. Though some of the story's twists and turns are interesting, the pacing and storytelling methods could have used some refinement. Be sure to get one of the two true endings to fill in all the plot holes. The five false ones explain very little.

In a strange twist, several of the main story missions take place underground or indoors, shifting the aspects of gameplay toward that of a traditional corridor shooter. If you really want to test out how S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s open world elements work, you'll need to embark on the many side quests The Zone's NPCs offer. Sadly only a handful of them are truly interesting. They mostly offer simple tasks such as kill a single target, wipe out a camp, or retrieve an object.

It is the spiritual predecessor and inspiration of the Metro franchise and most survival FPS games such as DAYZ, Escape From Tarkov, etc. With brutal and hardcore FPS mechanics the player needs to be careful in every battle, since loosing focus or ignoring an enemy for just a few seconds can mean a quick death (enemies 2-3 tap you). Inventory management, choosing the right ammo and the correct way to approach an enemy means the difference between winning or loosing a battle. The ""open world"" S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl offers is pretty empty with some relics and random encounters filling it up. But the open world, story and combat mechanics are secondary on a S.T.A.L.K.E.R game. The real beauty and value of all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is the impeccable atmosphere they have paired with an amazing sound design they make the player feel like they actually are inside the exclusion zone of Chernobyl. The developers actually went into Chernobyl and replicated almost every single building to perfection, which gives this game a really authentic feel. The lighting, footsteps, original Russian dub, mechanics, inventory management, brutal and unforgiving combat experience and eerie atmosphere is what makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl such a great game and why even today it is considered a cult classic and it is the inspiration of most hardcore/tactical FPS games. This game delivers a tense, frustrating but overall rewarding experience, a feeling only the Metro franchise manages to replicate (and only partially). The game has a lot of issues being mostly age related issues, being an old game, the mechanics are old, the graphics are old, the dub is extremely scuffed, the animations are clunky, the story is mediocre, the is no fast travel at all (some quests make you run across the whole map just to get one item and then run all the way back for a few rubles), combat is completely broken (you can waste 2-3 mags on a enemy or 1 tap him, and enemies do the same to you, it works on a randomized system with horrible bullet deviation and recoil mechanics), and finally some areas are either extremely easy (Garbage) or almost impossible to get over (Chernobyl Plant). I played on maximum difficulty to get the authentic experience and I recommend it. Somehow the charm S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has is precisely its extremely weird mix of hardcore FPS with clunky and outdated mechanics/graphics.
Overall S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl is an amazing game if you have no problem with older games and a few bugs. It delivers a fun and rewarding experience for any Metro fan, hardcore FPS fan and/or player who loves to experience older games and cult classics. Worth it for its full price 100%, but sales are very common and you can get all 3 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games (Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat) for under $20

First time playing and on regular the pigs ate all my ammo and was still running around gnawing on my leg so i switched it up

Second playthrough i heard 5 men yell ""CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE"" before they rushed me around the corner and fucked my shit.
 
Reloaded a quicksave and killed all the men. Proceeded to tbag their corpses (which was a mistake seeing as they adopted an anomaly as a fucking pet and i got squeezed harder than my grandma at Christmas when she hasn't seen me in a week. Whatever they put in the water back in her day certainly didn't make any frogs gay) 

Later found two doggos who ran at the first sight of me. Mama always said i was a handsome boy so i was confused to why they were running. They later returned with their parents after they kept screaming about stranger danger. The Dad was extremely hostile (understandable in today's climate but i just wanted to pat the doggo nothing else)
I proceeded to yell ""He's coming right for me"" and put the family down so if i go to stalker court i have a valid defence. Looted their body and to my surprise the dad was strapped with roubles and an aks-74 with ammo.

time to shit myself 


on a serious note tho this game is fantastic the gameplay is great.


 A lot of people seem frustrated by how bullet spongy the enemies are.

my advice though is to use scoped auto rifles and engage your enemies far away all it takes is a short burst to the head and the enemy is down 

the same applies for zombies as well

in close range tho use a pistol or shotgun with a shotgun just two shots to even the most toughest enemies will suffice but pistols allow a more precise shooting in case of a surprise attack from dogs or mutant boars

10/10 i love the game


PS: buy brown pants before playing

It represents a gaming style that challenges a player and offers less direction than more modern games. This type of game can be hard to do well and is likely a matter of taste while touching on nostalgia. My experience with STALKER for one who has never played it before was open-minded. The game is interesting enough to finish. However, I do not feel that it was an enjoyable investment of my time. This was because of: bullet spongy enemies, poor in-game supplemental lighting such as through night vision goggles, mediocre ""story"", and poor atmosphere for horror.

Bullet spongy enemies: I play on hardest difficulty. While some bullet sponginess is to be expected, this leads to me getting killed by enemies that should have been taken out ages ago.
Supplemental lighting: the night vision with the Stalker suit is poorly calibrated. It does not really help see at all and needs its brightness to be increased.
""Story"": the game feels extremely linear, even in its open world. The side quests do not really contribute anything so I have chosen to skip them. The actual quest starts with an interesting premise, but nothing comes of it even 8ish hours into the game. I more so moved forward with the game to see it through its conclusion than I was enjoying it.
Poor horror atmosphere: the mutants were freaky and got a jump scare initially, but became tedious and not really that impressive. Per the story, overall everything I faced was a bit of a slog.

I personally would not recommend the game, even on sale. When playing an unmodded game, it has not aged well and many aspects of it need improvement. While this is likely touched on by mods, I am reviewing the game and not the mods. The game may be worth it for those playing for nostalgia's sake, but for those new to the STALKER series, it was not anything special.",1641013872,1641013872,False,23,8,0.489477604627609253,0,True,False,False

Rather than play the game on normal I immediately set it on the hardest possible difficulty, and didn't stop to wonder why a dog took up two clips of my pistol. Rather than learn from that, I came upon a group of stalkers about to charge into a bandit camp and said to them I will do it solo, after all I realised that the knife in this game was op... That was a mistake. 
Stealth works as much as it does irl if they can see you or use there super hearing you bet your damn life you will die because playing Johnny Rambo armed with only a knife doesn't do well in a gun fight especially when a gun pointed directly at you acts as a shield preventing you to get close enough for it to even connect to their hit box. Reloading I begged the other Stalkers for help and then looted all of their bodies as both stalkers and bandits wiped each other out.

As I learned more about the games aiming mechanics that the closer you are to mother earth the more she blesses you with accuracy rather than admiring your gun by looking down the sight, I decided to attack a group of screaming bandits. Why were they screaming? I didn't know but all I was thinking was free money. Coming up on the bandits one charged me and was swept up by a vortex, then I realised what the screams were. Laughing at this stupid bandit I was quickly beset by the rest of his gangs and decided to run. Behind me there was a vortex. I died.

After this I tried making friends. Other stalkers will like you more if you help them especially when you give them first aid kits as the writhe in agony on the floor. I did this to veterans and you have a stalker killer machine as your friend, then I watched as almost instantly a large ravenous horde of hungry dogs arrives and kill said new friend.
Get the hell under ground to get away from said dogs, realise the horror of your decision while you nearly crap you pants as a screaming deformed mutant pops out of no where and has only tentacles for a face, try to assure yourself its okay. Call yourself a liar as another decides to use you as a rag-doll with its psychic powers. 
Shaken, pop up and realise you are under a military base. Feel good that you've come a long way from getting wiped out by bandits as you wipe out the soldiers and 'acquire' their hardware. 
Leave to a new area and get swarmed by a massive group of dogs and die before relaxing at the bar.

I'm writing this review on completion of the game's story line with games with a main story i wont write a review until i have finished it to add to authenticity to my review i finished the game on veteran second from the highest difficulty. There will be no spoilers in this review so people that haven't played are safe :) so this game is simply amazing at first glance it looked like a normal retro FPS with not much to expect from gun play and AI but ohh buddy was i wrong about that. This games gun play is really in depth for the time period it was made in its flush, smooth and easy to get used to you have the ability to peek left and right around corners which comes in handy a lot in this game as sometimes you have handfuls of enemies coming at you in tight fighting areas like hallways, rooms, and staircases but there is a fair amount of fighting outside as well you get two weapons to have on quick bar at all times your pistol and your long gun (Assault, Sniper, SMG) but you also have a inventory you can keep other guns in as well but you have a weight limit like any RPG game there are certain stash boxes in places you take missions from to keep all your weapons in they will not delete and there is also a trader in every major spot to sell and buy goods from as well as for the rest of gun play you have a basic crouch walk and then a full crouch to get even lower behind cover if you need to which also comes in handy a lot there are few different ammo types for each pretty much every gun. As for types of guns there are plenty to choose from there is many different pistols, assault rifles, and sniper rifles so there is lots of room for mixing it up and finding your perfect gun combinations for your play style i played with pistol and assault most of the time but i actually waited until later on to make a final decision on what guns i wanted with me for the ending of the game which happened to be a G-37 and a 45. Caliber pistol and a sniper to back it up which was a VSS. Grenades are very handy in this game and you have a couple different types of frags no flash bangs or stuns. AI in this game from what i seen was really done well they fight like they are really in a gun fight using cover constantly and shooting precisely but not all the time to where its unrealistic aim from the enemy the AI in gun fights is really great and fun to fight there are many different factions in this game so your not fighting the same group of people all the time it changes quite a bit so it wont get stale the two main fractions that war with one another is Duty and Freedom which there is missions surrounding that war which makes for good side fun the AI acts like they are actually in gun fights and make smart decisions they will activity stalk you and try to sneak up on you to kill you which they will sometimes and it just makes you become more aware of your surroundings and watching your back becomes a normal thing which i find really cool that the enemies are smart so all in all i say a 10/10 on fighting the AI's. The missions are in depth and tell a lot of story which the story in this game is really good there some cut scenes but mainly in the main story but i'm not gonna tell any of the story and spoil it for new players there is really good RPG elements here where you can ask multiple questions sometimes and find out more about the story in depth sometimes you have a handheld communication device which hold things like your map, diary, tasks, and general more in depth explanations and lore on areas, anomaly's, factions, mutants etc etc  etc. the graphics are very good for the year the game was made in they are not top of the line either but its not terrible you can tell the devs put a lot of time and creation into every area of the map there are serious fallout vibes with this game as well but its not so much to where it still is its own game within its self but Fallout fans will get what i'm talking about here its completely free roam and there are plenty of side missions to do and great rewards for doing them and also extends the story on top of a great game with a great story which i really really like i recommend doing as much side activities as you can before completing the whole game because once you finish the game you don't go back to playing the game unless you have a save game before you beat the game and like i said doing side quest will get you better weapons, gear (Armor) and let you get enough money to outfit yourself with med kits and anti rad med before doing major missions i also recommend playing the game on veteran the second from the highest difficulty for people that want a solid challenge while not over doing it. This is very important the game's auto save feature isn't the greatest and don't auto save as frequently as it should so you could be playing a mission and get hella far and die then have to go way back and do it all over again so i recommend saving often manually so that don't happen that's the only bad thing i have to say about the game as for bugs surprisingly there isn't much to speak of which is always a good thing all in all i recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a solid story, Fps, and role playing all in the same game the story is 10/10 forsure and i will be purchasing the other games to see the rest of the story before stalker 2 comes out in 2022 solid gun play, story, side stories, AI, map and RPG elements in a post apocalyptic setting i recommend this game to any gamer that loves first person shooter RPGS once i started playing i couldn't stop until i beat it which not many newer games can do for me now days great job to the guys that made this game and can't wait to see the brand new one coming out in action thanks steam community for reading hope you guys had a great holidays and have a happy new year!",1640678759,1640678759,True,1,2,0.5,0,True,False,False

This game is a masterpiece. It's immersive, unpredictable, tense, violent and deeply rewarding. There are certain mechanics here which I'm shocked and saddened haven't been copied in more modern games. Once such mechanic is are the permanent corpses on the ground, which can actually be a half decent way to store items and equipment too heavy to carry, but too valuable to not stash away and grab later.

The world feels genuinely alive and populated with individuals, all with different agendas and behaviors. Taking a life carries a lot of weight somehow, even though the NPCS lack a little visual verity, I can only put that to the masterful world building and atmosphere.

The starting weapons are a bit naff, but the progression from wasteland scrub to unstoppable killing machine is a journey which is as riveting today as it probably ever was. Something has to be said about the horror elements at play here as well, I don't want to spoil anything about it but I'll just say there were many sequences in this game which had me jumping out of my seat, fumbling my controls and staring at the screen in bewilderment.

The only negatives I can think of;
- The map is clunky by today's standards.
- Some side questing can be a little underwhelming. There are some repeatable side quests which, while totally optional, aren't always clearly explained, and the trudging round the map backwards and forwards won't feel like a great use of your time. I'd say go for the unique side quests, but if you never do any of those repeatable quests you won't feel like you've missed much.

I haven't completed it yet, but I'm more than satisfied with the experience this game has offered in the short amount of time I've played it.",1640034450,1640034450,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun and engaging, the missions give you something to do and there's tons of weapon and item variety. Basically kind of like Metro Exodus but with an entirely open world (which is amazing for an 2007 game!). I was also surprised that this game does in fact support ultrawide resolutions and runs really well on my modern hardware

 However, you have to keep in mind that it still is a 2007 and a jank game, which definitely gives you the following flaws:

- The game is ""figure it out for yourself"" which might be good or bad. Modern games seem to hold your hand a bit too much, but retro ones do it too little sometimes, however in contrast to other games that had this issue, the objectives of stalker were pretty clear to me and I only got very lost one or two times in labs in opposed to *cough* some other games
- Furthermore, the story is completely nonsensical, apparently there is a story if you decide to talk to some guy named the Guide, but this is never hinted at, and is just randomly placed in your mission list. I recon most people will not figure this out. And the ending you get is really really stupid if you don't figure this out.
- The AI is both wonderful and awful at the same time. They dodge grenades, push in groups, etc. and seem to possess some kind of intelligence.. until they dont and just stare at you
- The voice system is fucking awful, if you go near some guy he will literally repeat the same voice line a million times and my god its annoying. If I hear "" I HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU STALKER""  one more time I swear I will go insane
- The resources you get are over the top for a survival game, which makes it less atmospheric then say metro 2033, at the ending I had like 3 end game suits of armor, 4 guns and 1000 rounds and a ton of grenades, healing, etc. It really takes the ""stress""  of you if you can just spam medkit of radaway constantly without any consequences",1639768489,1639768676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my review but over all as someone who just beaten it and someone who loves wasteland type settings and more. This is hands down a most for anyone who loves single player games and who wants something more from Metro(I beaten all of the games and now I'm reading the book slowly).

This game is much more harder then any game you will most likely play if you play on the hardest(as you should). Why the hardest you may ask? Well to save you from wasting bullets! The harder the game is the easier it is to kill things. But the same goes for you as well.

The story is pretty damn solid and then ending(s?) are worth it too. 

There are side missions and quests you can do while you get to the point of following the main quest which can be a bit of a drag if I can be honest here. But for anyone who is thinking about buying this game. I would and I would do it again and again! Even when my first saved got wiped because I had to switch out my dying hard drive with a newer one.

The base game is broken. You will install it, you will make some headway and progress, you will enjoy yourself and then it will crash. You will load it up and play for five to ten minutes and then it will crash. You will load it up and it will crash. I've been told the reasons behind this and I understand them wholeheartedly but I will not give this game a passing grade.

Then I found that there were several patches that could fix up the unstable engine and not only make the game playable but with even better gameplay and better graphics - Considering how awesome the game was otherwise, I was willing to go in for another run. I installed the Memories of the Zone mod and had a phenomenal time.

Then I got to the endgame. I did everything I could, handled all that needed to be handled and got ready for either an epic showdown or an unraveling of the mysteries... Instead, I got two back-to-back countdowns til death. One was on a direct timer, which I believe was originally cut out but brought back in by the mod - This was fine. It was close, required quick decisions to be made but I made it. Then there was an indirect timer which used the game's radiation system. Unfortunately for me, there were three areas since the last trader I encountered and all of them were packed with radiation hotspots. So, I rush through this area, unable to take in the scenery as I'm going from body to body, scrounging for items to heal radiation and health where I can and I come to the first area that actual through me into the first tangent I'd had since before patching the game. I'd already been informed of the fact that there were multiple endings and had followed the questline down to a tee. Unfortunately, the path to following said questline is hidden away in a dark corner that you'd only be able to see if you took your time to observe your surroundings like you could with the rest of the game. After several deaths by radiation, an accidental starting of the bad ending, taking a moment to confide in my roommate's cat and looking up a walkthrough, I found it.

After that, the fun gets back on track. I go through an area, the gunplay is back to an all-time high... then I'm suddenly playing a slower-paced version of Portal. Weird and it's giving me the same negative vibes I got from Black Ops 3's ending, feeling like I've been completely disconnected and left out on why I'm doing the things I'm doing... and then it crashed. I cursed before sucking it up and loading my last save saying that this happens. Then it crashed again at the same spot. I saved just before then and I'm suspicious. I load the save, I go to the area and it crashed at the exact same spot again. I don't know the issue and I do not care to solve it anymore.

In short, I gave this game more chances than any unstable game I've ever played because I've found it to be very legitimately fun. But the repeated crashes and a lackluster start to the true ending has absolutely killed any desire to see it through. I wanted to experience the ending with my own eyes and see the journey through... but even though I must have been less than a hundred yards away from that point, all of the duct tape that I had to apply myself, provided by a third party who I think were more dedicated than this game deserves, wasn't enough to keep it together.

In summary, if a game's going to crash and break at the most pivotal moments, why does it have to be so damn fun and leave me feeling so empty about being unable to complete it?",1639263348,1639263348,False,5,0,0.477295249700546265,0,True,False,False

In Far Cry, for example the game would make them survive no matter what. The graphics nor the lightning are not the best, but the atphosmere makes that up.

I remember the release postponement drama and the game gaining a reputation for being on the same scale as ""Duke Nukem Forever"".  And when it finally came out, it was panned for being a bug-ridden mess, if it would run remotely stable.  Disheartened, I forgot about STALKER for a bit.  But then I got a copy for free several years later in a MaximumPC(?) magazine (disclaimer - I re-purchased on Steam some time later).  Tossed it aside, finding it another year or two later while cleaning and decided to install it.  Found the patches.  And from then on, the STALKER franchise has held a special place in my heart.  

The atmosphere, the music, the authentic visual assets make it a masterpiece.  But the sheer danger that the world poses your character, and the resultant feeling of 'blood-chilling survival exploration' is something that makes it a sub-genre of FPS all of its' own.  Escape From Tarkov derived significant spiritual influence from STALKER.  But STALKER still stands firmly on its own.  I highly recommend checking out the modding scene - you will at minimum find 'community patches' for issues never addressed by the developer.  At maximum, you will find total overhaul mods like the 'Lost Alpha' mod, weapon packs, graphical enhancements - the list goes on.

It's not an easy game and it takes a ton of patience but it was like the disfigured-at-birth cousin of Fallout3. The Ukrainian development house had a ton of resources to draw on and they made a game that's incredibly dark, horrific and frustrating especially as you get closer to ""ground zero"". This is based on a real life source so as you wander this wasteland you can't help but remember that real people were actually there after the accident in 1986.

You turn up on the edge of the zone, found by a group call themselves STALKERS, they prowl the zone around the old power station and even venture in, making a living scrounging what they can and containing the mutated beings that are there. You start working for a greedy dirtbag who live sin a bunker and you work for people, make contacts, build relationships and so on. End goal is to get into the core of the old power station but trust me that's a long way off to begin with you have a ton of work to do to get good gear ready to even get anywhere near the outskirts of Pripyat. 

That's one of the cool things, way before Bethesda started banging on about how great their IA was ( which sometimes it's not! ) this little team from the Ukraine were wiping the floor with their US counterparts in terms of AI. This game will punish you hard if you go it alone, it won't stop you but you will find it harder to fight the AI but that's the cool thing you have the choice. Just like life, you ignore people then life gets harder than it should, but you have the choice, you always have the choice.

A lot of good memories of my first real 3D open world/apocalytic horror game, still a landmark game and 15 years later, still very much worth playing,

The first part of the legendary series of games ... What can I say? Well I do not know. I remember playing stalker as a child, my dad let me play a little after kindergarten. Constantly sat on 1 location and was afraid to get out, ate only sausage and was afraid of snorks ... huh, it's fun to remember) Now many people who have not played stalker come and study this game, not understanding what many players found in it. And the truth is, if you play for the first time, the game seems a little raw, but remember where and how the game was made, After all, it was transferred several times, the publisher THQ drove the developers to quickly release the game and the fans who hoped to see the promised masterpiece were already tired of the endless transfers of the game. But nevertheless, the game turned out to be not bad for that time, especially for a small, unknown, Ukrainian company. For example, the A-LIFE system, which made it so that the NPC did not spawn just like that somewhere in front of the player, creating a pseudo-living world, but actually simulated a real behavior. The stalker could spawn on the outskirts of the zone, go a long way ... and so, he sits in front of your fire and sings songs ... In conclusion, I will say that the game is worth passing so that they will delve into the world of this game.

A-Life as was coined by the developers (GSC) is an integral part of the dynamic world you'll find yourself in. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SOC features a system of life simulation and can accurately be described as as the glue that holds everything together in the exclusion Zone. You've got a huge and dangerous environment to explore, other S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s to interact with, secret post Soviet labs to explore and anomalies to discover.

Under normal circumstances this would't be very interesting if the game ran on rails and if everything was scripted based on your current progress and particular location. This is where A-Life comes in. It's a system that controls everything in the game that lives and breathes. It also ensures that no two games of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. will play out in the same way.

The second you start playing, there are hundreds of other characters (from fellow S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s to mutant bloodsuckers) in Chernobyl that are going about their daily business. Your presence in the game alters this life cycle just because you're there. This change isn't for better or worse, it's just a change and things will react to your presence or they won't. 

Bandits, anarchists and hordes of mutants roam the land and attack each other while you roam the radiation soaked Ukrainian landscape. On the surface this might seem random, but should you decide to kill a pack of mutated boars, for example, it might have larger ramifications later on. The mutants might have originally wandered into an enemy camp and inadvertently killed a few bad guys thereby making your job that much easier, but now they're mutated worm food so this won't happen.

There's an ongoing persistent life cycle happening in the Zone and you're just a visitor. So come on in, don't stand there and come discover the secrets of the Zone. 

On a final note whether you're a rookie or a Zone legend let's all just pray to the Monolith that the long awaited sequel to the series: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (2) Heart of Chernobyl, lives up to it's predecessors and that the AI and A-Life 2.0 can be revolutionary like in was in the first 3 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.

While the game has aged relatively well, one must still keep in mind that this is a game produced with shoestring budget and had a somewhat troubled development cycle. The caveats in mind, STALKER is an excellent semi-open world shooty-survival-y romp with a decent story to it. The story is told through a few cutscenes, but mostly through either someone radioning you and telling something has happened, or through a dialog box before or after a mission.

At its core, STALKER is a shooter leaning more into survival and methodical play, rather than fast paced action. In the Zone, a few shots can drop you, but the enemies follow similar rules. The only thing that gives the enemies any kind of advantage, is their numbers and their uncanny ability to throw grenades. The game does not really have a stealth system, but you can equip a silencer in your weapon and pick off a few enemies before the rest notice that something is amiss.

The game's age shows mostly through the slightly muddy visuals and many aged systems. For instance, you cannot repair your weapons or armor without the use of a mod that enables the functionality, which means you will be replacing your shooter and suit frequently. Thankfully(?), there are no upgrade systems either, so any suit A is going to be equivalent to any other suit A.

There are a number of things I would recommend you change if you are just getting into STALKER: firstly, I would suggest getting the Complete mod or something similar, as they fix a number of issues and bugs, and add some much-needed quality of life features, like repairing gear at Barkeep. Before that, you likely won't need to repair your items, as you will be rapidly acquiring better weapons and protective suits. After that, the rate of acquisitions slows down and you will find yourself sticking to one or two weapons and one suit for an extended period of time. In addition to the mod, you may want to look into tweak guides that allow you to get rid of the absolutely horrible headbobbing, and allows you to improve the visuals/performance of the game.

STALKER is definitely not for everyone, but for those whom this style of game appeals will love it, and revisit the Zone for years to come even in spite of the flaws and shortcomings of the currently released games. One can only wonder how STALKER 2 will be like. Keep your Quicksave button close at hand, and get out of here, STALKER.",1637791830,1637791830,True,49,0,0.802544653415679932,0,True,False,False

(Scrolls down for TL;DR)

It’s a solid FPS, with light RPG mechanics and an interesting progression cycle going through the game, where you have to FIND better stuff to use as opposed to upgrading it with items and skills. The survival elements are practically nonexistent so if that seems off putting, don't worry. The horror element, although enjoyable and atmospheric, is sort of hit or miss. The story was surprisingly intriguing and helps push you into new areas without completely limiting your options to explore.

The beginning of the game is the most difficult if you’re a new player, and the simple reason is they give you the worst weapons ever put into a first person shooter. Your pistol is painfully inaccurate and the shotgun feels like it doesn’t have as much kick unless you’re breathing on the enemies. It’s not until you begin to transition into the mid-game and acquire the military’s weapons until you really start to get a feel for how satisfying the gun-play can be. And it’s not until the late game that weapons start to feel overpowered. But by that point enemy density and AI makes up for the insane leap in weaponry. Speaking of AI, it's not as legendary as most make it out to be. Yes, if you stand still and try to pick fights at range, enemies will flank or just plain outgun you. The key is maneuverability and learning to close the gap by running between cover like trees and hiding in bushes. That sort of trails off once you enter the final level where it devolves into a painful corridor shooter, where enemies can be stupid enough to funnel into a choke point where you dome them one by one as they line up behind one another. 

A few (sort of essential) gameplay tips:
--CTRL+SHIFT, crouch, is the best way to shoot your weapon, as it maximizes character accuracy.
--Remember to move forward behind cover, crouch, and lean with Q and E to utilize cover
--Always aim for the head, its the difference between 1 bullet and 20 to putting an enemy down
--Always quick-save BEFORE and AFTER a combat encounter. After a few hours you sort of get a feel for when they are so be aware of when you last saved, the only time AUTO SAVE is utilized is transitioning between areas. Hell, Save DURING encounters, it helps to have a checkpoint at difficult points in the game. QUICK-SAVE is F6, and QUICK-LOAD is F7 (at least those were my defaults), just make sure you know what your key binds are before you start the game. These will save you a lot of time.
--SAVE GAME in the pause menu I would recommend for major points in the game, such as primary quest line steps, since QUICK-SAVE only saves 2 files in between each SAVE GAME. Just be aware of what’s what.


Now bugs. For my first play-through, I had a relatively smooth time, only crashing once, and sort of tuning out frame stutters as they don’t bother me too much. My second time through, more became apparent. Sometimes after killing an enemy they clip into the world objects or ground, and will occasionally beat you to death with their ragdoll stretch, it's annoying, and frustrating, and why you should always QUICK-SAVE when possible. Frame stutters were common again, but I don't mind them. Other times I would need to interact with an NPC during a quest and they would bug out, after I turned in a specific quest step, they would repeat they’re scripting until I loaded a previous save or sometimes it would fix itself if I ignored it long enough. If any of this is a deal-breaker, I'd highly recommend a mod fix/ patch. I’m yet to use any of the recommended ones, so explore among the community or reviewers for specifics. 

Lastly, I wanted to touch some of the items of the game I really enjoyed that I can't really fit anywhere else. I’m a real sucker for acoustic guitar so when I found that other stalkers in game would frequently sit around fires playing guitar, I found it not only sleuthing, but enjoyable, and fascinating world building, and immersion. Some of those Stalkers play absolute BANGERS, and I was always delighted to take a break from stash hunting or side quest grinds to just sit and enjoy the tunes. It really was a highlight in my experience.
	Another that really should have been mentioned earlier were artifacts. This is where the light RPG mechanic comes into play and I found them really cool. So essentially throughout the zone strange ‘anomalies' as they’ve been dubbed, spawn artifacts that allow the user a statistical buff when equipped. They’re small boosts to almost any stat in the game but at costs to other stats. So the hunt slowly becomes this sort of build crafting of what your favorite combination of artifacts are. Yes, objectively there are the best ones, but unless you frequent the wiki to figure out where to find them, most of the time you will be juggling a lot of buffs and debuffs which adds an interesting dynamic to the game beyond “guy shoot gun, guy gun shoot guy, win game”

TL;DR: Stalker is an interesting take on the post apocalypse genre, and is one that oozes creativity, talent, depth, intrigue, atmosphere and artistically one of the most sound games I’ve managed to play and enjoy thoroughly in the past few years. I highly recommend it to those looking for a fun shooter with a decent story, interesting light RPG mechanics, and enjoyers of batshit crazy awesome Russian tomfoolery most have come to recognize in gaming.

PROs and CONs

Pros:
- Despite looking aged, it does build ambience well for any given area.
- Some enemies in the game can legitimately feel intimidating, even if you know how to deal with them, even the ""creepy"" ones.
- Events in the world around you make the game feel more like you're part of an evolving world, you're not the world itself.
- You have to make decisions on what you should take with you to avoid being overencumbered, especially if looking for loot to sell or use. Quite realistic in that regard.
- There ""technically"" is a way to bank items, though I think it's unintentional, so you can keep gear you think you may need later.
- The cutscenes genuinely look good, probably amazing at the time it was released.
- You can use 6 to interact with anomolies by throwing a bolt into them and sets them off before your proximity alert pops up. Especially useful in dark areas or at night.
- The presence of anomolies gives the feeling of danger and caution in conjunction with radioactivity, more so when you hear their respective sounds either in tandem or by themselves.
- Some mini-games are fun, but can be easily completed once you understand how best to fight an enemy.

Cons:
-It's easy to over or underestimate enemies or areas, leaving one feeling like the game is too easy or hard.
-You have to grind to make sure you have enough money to get decent gear or other items.
-""Miniquests"" are worse in terms of rewards compared to fighting hostile enemies and taking their gear to a trader which becomes boring quickly. 
-Said miniquests have timers to complete them, including returning to the quest-giver. Even if you do the quest, you'll get no reward if you don't return on time.
-Some ""critical"" NPCs can die when you may need them for longer quests, instead of being incapacitated, as expected for critical NPCs.
-Unique gear can often feel redundant to stuff you can buy, especially with the hauling gear tactic.
-Some scripted events can become confusing, especially with one mutant that you can't escape unless you kill it, which with what you see, you'd not think you'd need to shoot it, which you have to do.
-Saves can sometimes bug, changing reputation is the most common bug the game will do, usually defaulting to ""Terrible""
If you're going in and doing the same mentality as mine, ""Lets play blind, no mods"". You'll be disappointed. Not only has the game aged badly and has a lack of choice (which some mods can create 
 more of), but there are glitches that can soft-lock you or if you dare to open GeForce Experience, it'll crash the game. ALSO, as a side note, if you do decide to get this game, get mods like Anomoly or other game-enhancing things that allow joinable factions, better indicators and statistics, retextures and lighting. There are a good portion of mods for this game, so if you do play, use mods and not spend 30 hours with a game that's aged poorly and can be improved upon via mods.

For instance, at one point in the game, someone will block a door (even random NPCs can just stand in your way unless you walk a fair distance away from them), despite whether or not you try to get them to move, if that be by talking to them, pointing your gun at them, moving away from them, leaving then returning to the area, reloading a save. Nothing. The only thing that fixed it for me was a random gunfight somewhere in this location and he went into combat mode and stood aside.

Talking about the combat, the game makes enemies feel like spongy. Even dogs can take many 7.62mm bullets like a slap. to paraphrase; someone identified that in the code, the damage to the body is very little, even with late-game weapons, but headshots with most weapons - even lower ""tiered"" ones - will one-shot kill in most cases.

Enemies do make an attempt to take cover, which I can commend, in groups they will often be able to pin you down and in the early game they'll just sit there and wait, step out so you can get some shots in and vice versa, then back to cover. I'm not sure if it's intentional just early game to get you used to using your own cover and other mechanics, but later on enemies will, in groups, will advance towards you, this did backfire on them once as they all clumped up into a doorway and all I had to do was duck out of cover, precisely toss a grenade and wham, a good portion of them died.

The game does a piss-poor way of telling you how weapons scale and doesn't actively encourage experimentation outside of ""Find gun, fire, does it feel good and/or has good stats compared to your gun/s? if not, drop, if good, keep and find ammo"". The latter of the two can be problematic early game as most ammo for some guns can only be found in later on as well as armour. Whilst it gives descriptions for the armour, it never tells you any stats, like radiation resistance, bullet armour, et al. The guns get a slider of 4 factors: Damage, fire rate, accuracy and handling. There are no numbers, just the slider. you just pick your poison; fire rate but less damage? poor handling over great accuracy? (As a side note, handling doesn't ""feel"" like it does much outside of 1 or 2 weapons. It just reduces your DPI, easily solved these days). 

I think this game was more directed towards Russians (As they speak Russian, despite being set in Ukraine). A lot of the dialogue outside of some important stuff such as main story dialogue, some particular encounters and ""come here I'm an important NPC"" is in English, but only a small handful of ambient stuff is in English. Most encounters, including combat, are strictly in Russian, so it's hard to tell what's communicated outside of one specific route I took where the enemies were in particularly hard areas to see and allies called them out to me, which was very useful. I was hoping it'd be the opposite away around but in English also, even if it was just insults.

There are also times where NPCs will repeat the same phrase over and over to the point I will take my headphones off. Particularly one fellow who says ""Get out of here Stalker"". If you stay in the same room as him, he won't fire, but he'll keep saying it every few seconds or so. This also goes with Russian dialogue (I only recognised it from being present and hearing the same words repeated). It's also a damn shame that there are no subtitle options.

The story left me a bit non-plussed. Especially how it was encouraging me to push further into the later areas of the game, yet one of your ""constant"" objectives is to find someone and kill them (Not a spoiler, literally one of the first things you have assigned on your tasks list). So I was pushing into ""The zone"", as it's called, but kept going back to do this objective. Unfortunately the game suffers from a big ""okay now find it or use a guide"". But a lot of games in development back when it was made had that sort of mentality anyway.

As a result, this ""Kill this guy"" quest-line gets shoved out the way quite easily unless you're constantly recalling it. I imagine if I played it again (which I ""maybe"" will do, but with mods), the story would be a little more fulfilling.

Similar to games like the Metro series and Fallout, the game's ending will differ depending on the actions you take, though these are very specific and rely more on very narrowed-down. For instance, one ending I got is considered the ""Negative"" ending, which requires that you have a ""terrible"" reputation, though I was pretty sure my reputation was ""excellent"". (EDIT: My save bugged, I would've gotten the ""positive"" ending otherwise)

Final Verdict.
Ultimately, I'd say not to buy this game to play it in it's ""vanilla"" way (again, I can't recommend it modded either since I've not done that yet), but I imagine that, even with mods, it might not be en par with even Fallout 3. I am amiss to say it's an ""okay"" game due to this. If it's on sale for something like a mere £5, go ahead and try it with mods, but for the sake of a more interesting game, use mods.",1636847362,1636855823,False,2,1,0.491607397794723511,0,True,False,False

I think though that I made a few mistakes out of my walkthrough that made my time harder. First of all, look up how each difficulty works because there seems to be this notion that the ""easiest way to play"" is master difficulty. There is some truth to it but not completely. Also spam save if you dont want to be stuck in the same gun fight for an hour.

Now for the game itself,
The story is really basic and the way the game is structured makes it really hard to understand and you need a lot of commitment to understand the lore (not just the main storyline). The start of the game sucks ass because of how shit and inaccurate all the guns are. The gunplay certainly gets more tight.

The world of stalker is really interesting and really vibrant despite how gray and dark green everything is. 

I think the game shines in various moments and aspects but the side missions ,  and the beginning and end of the game are too frustrating to call even remotely worthwhile.

The progression feels good as you get stronger and stronger but so does everyone else. But just so you know look around carefully as you can find a lot of loot that can be important for progression.

I believe some of my frustrations are due to my mistakes and lack of proper searching for better equipment but the game lacks any proper indication of lots of its mechanics and you will have to end up googling everything. For example, boxes contain very good loot but you might be playing for a while before finding out... and lots of other things

I will give it a thumbs up mostly because of the midgame which obviously can last a while if you choose to stick around.

I played on master difficulty with the Zone Reclamation Project mod, which, as far as I know only does bug fixes and retains the original vanilla experience. The atmosphere is great, it creates a really tense mood, and I was constantly on the edge of my seat in the underground areas in particular. I am very impressed by the lighting this game has, it really holds up the graphics that have otherwise aged quite a bit, I especially like how NPCs cast dynamic light with their flashlights. The combat is really tense, but I wish that I was able to hear human enemies' footsteps, because they took me by surprise constantly around corners and slow walk everywhere, it would just help to increase combat awareness if I could hear them move around. I also like the way the story is paced, they give you very little story initially so you can focus on exploring the world and overcoming the initial difficulty curve, afterwards they start to give you the story to propel the plot forward. It's worth noting that this game is absolutely brutal in its difficulty, especially at the start and the end. The start is hard because you just don't have weapons accurate enough to consistently land headshots, and the end is hard because it just throws droves and droves of enemies at you and forces you to heavy radiation which is just annoying. If I counted how many deaths I had, it would probably be in the hundreds, and you will probably die a lot as well.

Well out of all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games to own, this is the one you must have above all else, the others are good but this one is the OG. Younger gamers will probably notice that it's dated more than those of us who have the pure nostalgia from 2005 and this dropped, however note that there are alot of mods, both visual and gamewise which can improve the experience for you. A personal favourite Mod for me was the Arsenal Mod which gave a much wider variety of firearms and mods. 

However, even vanilla and without any gun mods, this game is a must have because of the storyline. There is a reason this game enjoys 'cult' status and why people like myself and many, many others who have literally tripped over themselves to drop over £100 on the top edition of the long awaited S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chernobyl that drops in April and drags this game into the modern times.

Pro's:
The game has a good story-line and a great atmosphere and the, and the graphics where good for time when it was released. Still the graphics are great in 2019 after MODDING it , but thats my opinion. 

Cons:
- AI is broke (Some enemys dont respond if you dont shoot them)
- Glitches when you break crates or other wood with knife .. (Not a big glitch but its anoying)
- The story line is just lame. (I mean the story doesn't suck you into the game)
- Vanilla this game is full of bugs (without ZRP Mod this game will crash) 
- If you Uninstall the game its still in the steam folder.. 
- The sounds in this game are broke too ( Sometimes i didnt hear my Grenade )
- The Aim is bad in this game for automatic SMG guns, and its not your gameplay.
- This game feels like a very bad Fallout game but then very very BAD !

So i stop to play this game because it is simpely no FUN to play. I tried it on twitch and it feels like wasted time. I am glad i didnt buy this when it came out because i had an to high expectation for this game..

To be honest, the Steam version of this game is without a doubt the worst version possible, the graphics for some reason are downgraded and the game difficulty feels different. 
I played the game 2 years ago using my old DVD (it doesn't work anymore) and it sure felt a lot different. I don't really know why the game is a lot worse in the steam version but that's how i see it. It doesn't even run properly and the framerate is a mess.

If you want to play this game again someday, buy it somewhere else, because the steam version uses a different build of the game that is far from the amazing experience i had with this game 2 years ago. 
I know some people are okay with the changes or didnt find any issues but this version of the game is not for me.

STALKER, while not technically a part of the genre, really hits the post-apocalyptic feeling well.

SoC"" is a remarkable example of truly great storytelling and immersive atmosphere saddled with a god-awful combination of everything else in the alphabet from 'Aim' to 'Zone'. I have never felt so polarized in a gaming experience or wanted it to be better than it was so much, but to quote Melisandre from 'Clash of Kings' [i]""If half an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion.""[/i]

I want to start with the the feature that is really carrying ""STALKER"" which is the story and atmosphere. I won't repeat it in full here, but will say that I found it just as compelling and immersive as the most adoring fan of the series. The Ukrainian Zone of Chernobyl is the perfect dichotomy of despair and opportunity, artfully crafted and fully alive. The original story in the game melds perfectly with the environment, although the plot becomes a little too eccentric and quirky by the late game.

When the protagonist, named the Marked One, first sets out on early missions in the world it feels just like the moment in ""The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion"" when the Hero leaves the Imperial Prison to realize they are inhabiting a fully open world in a beautiful and atmospheric meadow. It's a limitless space filled with opportunity and wonder. There are artifacts for collecting, factions for joining and betraying, causes to either support or curtail, and guns...lots of guns.

This euphoric moment is the start of a long trend downward that begins immediately and doesn't end until the player finishes the game. First, you start to meet meet the NPC characters which differ from the environment in that they are pixelated and grainy creatures with odd gestures and only a rudimentary dialog tree (for reference, TES3: Morrowind released 2002, TES4: Oblivion in 2006, STALKER SoC in 2007.) Nearly every character in the game is just filler with useless dialog who are co-located with the few characters of some significance. For example, I learned from dozens of these NPC's that a noted STALKER named Otter had died several days ago. I expected some quest or additional lore about Otter to materialize, but it's just chatter that had become repetitive, like the popular meme ""Have you heard about the High Elves."" Nearly all dialog, both important and trivial, are delivered through lengthy and tedious text boxes that should have been retired by this year in game development.

Let's also take a moment to discuss the game's other real opponent - the inventory system. Without mods, the game allows the player to carry up to 60.0Kg of inventory or 70.0Kg with a fatigue penalty in extreme instances (i.e. the whole game.) Guns, ammo, artifacts, medkits, food, and even Vodka all add to carry weight, and it is extremely hard to do the weight/reward math in the field, especially when standing on an enemy spawn point (more on this later.) The loyalists to the STALKER brand will tell you that this makes the game more realistic, but I disagree. My job in the Accounting department is realistic, but I don't do it everyday for the authenticity.

There is also a perfect lesson here on Soviet money, which is that money isn't important. Nearly all goods that are sold (like guns and armor) are often found on enemy corpses and in stashes throughout the game, so you don't actually need the rubles to buy the best inventory in the game - what you need is the inventory space to carry it back, which brings us back to the original point. Long story short, money doesn't matter very much.

A text-based inventory system (a la Fallout 3) would probably have worked better than the grid-based system. Many guns look similar and I sold a valuable unique gun twice thinking that it was a more common variant. Also, the grid can reach further than the end the screen and keeps snapping back upwards, and moving multiple inventories is a chore. You can't move 'all' of one-type of ammo for example, so have to keep double-clicking to individually move 1,000 rounds of shotgun shells in 10 unit boxes. This could have been significantly improved with a little effort.

There are a number of places where the game is not shy about dropping you into an enemy spawn point, so the Marked One is in immediate mortal risk of pop-in bandits. In fact, instant death is around every corner so be sure to Quicksave often (but not too often because Quicksaving at a spawn point can also ruin your save in the worst way). There are actually some places on the map (like the Train Depot at Garbage) that function as a virtual Valhalla, in neverending conflict with spawning enemies for all time - don't use these locations to stockpile valuables.

There is no XP or leveling in the title, but the protagonist does grow stronger with added weapons and armor during the earlier levels. It is refreshing to take down those challenging bandits with ease, but there is an upper limit to this and almost no preparation will make the late game easier. This is where ""STALKER SoC"" becomes unforgivably difficult - the final stages nearest to the Chernobyl Reactor are what flipped my review from a soft positive to a sharp negative. The Monolith elites from the last few stages are not humans - they're bulletsponges built atop aimbots. The Marked One can only approach the final objective across a field of hyper-accurate snipers and rocket-launching helicopters who always know where the player is. There is no strategy to accomplish this, only lucky breaks that sometimes occur in 1 out of 100 attempts where a path opens in the field of fire, rewarding the player with even more corridors of elite bruisers who can shoot through walls and don't feel pain or lose accuracy even after a shotgun bolt through the nose. I was never nearer to throwing my keyboard through the wall than near the end of the title when the challenge rose to 500% and the drops became sparse. Here's the math: If every opponent costs 3/4 of player's health and 40 rounds of ammo, but only drops 10-15 rounds of ammo or a medkit 10% of the time, how do you keep playing? Only by hoping for perfect accuracy, hit detection and satisfactory drops from every body.

To fully compound this grueling and unsatisfying experience, I eventually survived to see the end of the game after hours of work from Pripyat. I actually did not pre-plan my ending to experience it without spoilers, and of course received the worst of several endings. All the sidequests I performed, factions I supported, and justice I had meted across the Zone mattered less than the fact that I had too many useless rubles in my pocket. It was a disappointing end to an experience that had been disappointing since after the Cordon.

There are mods out there to fix these and other issues, but purists will tell you that the mods are cheating and that a 'raw' vanilla experience is the way to play the game. These people are lying to you and not your friends - the game is unplayable without mods. I played with the 'Complete 2009' mod, but in retrospect I should have used more for just about every facet of the title.

I may actually come back to ""STALKER SoC"" with the right combination of mods that make the game tolerable because the story and world are just that appealing. But the gameplay and mechanics fail completely and I wouldn't wish the end-game on someone I especially despise, it's just too cruel. My opinion is in the minority of course because the title is 'Overwhelmingly Positive' in many review aggregators. I wish I could share in this general enthusiasm, but I physically feel years older after trying and failing at the ending chapters, only to eventually make it to the final objective and then learn that my real failure was starting in the first place. What the Marked One should have done from Sidorovich's bunker is immediately leave the zone, go to University, study tractors, and have children like Father always wanted.",1633871818,1635808465,False,56,13,0.66744154691696167,11,True,False,False

I would recommend this game to a very slim group of people, I'll get into it more below. Also because this is to kinda help out new players, ill keep it spoiler free. I will mostly be talking about drawbacks for the beginning, since its hard to find a solid honest critique of the game. I feel if I had some of these downsides mentioned, I might have liked the game a bit more.

Anyways, I really wanted to like this game. I love post apocalyptic games, I love Russian themed stuff (I mean, look at my name), and I especially love a well crafted game play experience that tells a great story. I had a friend recommend this game and when he explained the premise to me relating to all the stuff mentioned before, I thought it would be a perfect match. 

[u] Difficulty Meter [/u]
The bull shittery happens before you even get into the game with the difficulty meter. The difficulty meter is not 100% truthful to the point where the easiest difficulty is technically harder than the master difficulty. This is because the only change difficulty does is add more health to you and enemies. This sounds great at first, but then you realize that enemies will take 2 full mags up close from a rifle on easy to kill them and because you can only carry so many mags because of the carry limit, you will run out of ammo even before you get half way through a short quest.

[u] Intro [/u]
Anyways, starting the game I just want to say I like the intro a lot. Its not high quality but it sets you in the mood and it doesn't need to show you much to let you know how fucked up the ""wasteland"" is. Its so good I think it almost sets your expectations too high for the rest of the game. Right off the bat, all you are given is a shit pistol and you wont be able to kill consistently with the exception of blind dogs. And before I get ahead of myself...

[u] Bugs [/u]
The bugs. Holy fucking shit the bugs. I cant believe that almost no one in the reviews is talking about this. One of the most common bugs is a crashing bug while interacting with someones body. If you eat, bandage, or do anything other than take an item from a dead enemy's inventory, the game WILL CRASH. This is so annoying and let me set up a little scenareo just incase why you dont see this as a major problem. You are on your way back from a mission and your inventory is full and you are happy. Then you realize your character is starving to death (There is no hunger bar in the game btw) so you start to panic. But just then, as you are running down the road, some random dude starts shooting at you so you kill him. And just your luck, he has a loaf of bread! So you open the loot menu right click their bread and click eat. The game crashes and closes itself. You probably didn't even know it was your fault the first time you did it too, so chances are, you will try to eat or bandage yourself with in the same way mentioned above. You might ask why I wouldnt pick up the bread and carry it around til I need it, but the reason is that bread is heavier than some boxes of bullets. Not even going to get into any other bugs, just know there is some stuff you will just need to know happen and avoid doing them.

The game has fps fluctuations like crazy. Its not even that my computer is bad (I can run GTA V max settings just fine) its just certain areas tank like crazy. It doesnt happen all to often, but it happens enough that it deserves a little mention.

[u] Da Guns [/u]
I love weapons in video games, so here is a special little section just for them.
Firstly, the weapon selection is very slim for this type of game. There is only one sub machine gun in the game (The AKM-74/2U doesn't count as one) and the assault rifles are somewhat plentiful, but there is really no variety. All the people in one area will have AKMs and in another they will all have M4s.
Weapon jamming I think is actually a great addition, since it encourages swaping around guns more and stuff, but the gun seems to jam even if the gun is pretty new, and from what I can tell there is no way to repair a gun.
I dont know if this is the engines fault or what, but shooting in this game is fucked up. Sometimes an enemy will just not get hit by bullets, even at point blank. I have seen other people talk about this one so I know its not just me. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, but playing on the only usable difficulty (master) you can get one shot from a mile away while you cant hit them at all. Also, tap shooting doesn't seem to work consistently for me but most of the guns are so inaccurate you wouldnt be able to hit them even with the burst fire accuracy.

[u] Sound Design [/u]
The sound is bad, but not terrible. I just want to say this right off the bat, but this game uses stock sounds quite alot. So if you like to watch a lot of movies or... you know... play games, you will recognize quite a few of the sounds. Its really hard to get immersed in the game when your trekking along in the wilderness and then hear a stock sound used in ed edd n eddy and you get insta whiplash. Im exagerating a little, but I think you get my point.

[u] Story [/u]
And finally, the story. I couldnt help but want it to be like Fallout: New Vegas in this regard; shitty combat but good story. As you can already tell by the block of text under this, the story sucks. All I can say is that the story is just stale and predictable. But, as I said above, I wont spoil any of the story so consider your self lucky game. But to sum it up, you dont do any investigating yourself to progress the story, there are just a bunch of fetch quests back to back and you just have to run a mile to a lab, grab generic documents, and run back. About 10% of the story get explained throughout the way and then there is one guy you can talk to in the end that just tells you everything that happened and that one guy literally tells you what feels like 90% of the story. Without spoiling it and cutting the story segment short, the story is so dull and predictable, I figured out the only plot twist of the game on the 2nd major quest.

[u] Quests [/u]
The side quests are terrible. They add nothing to the story, and the characters that ask you to do them usually just have one line of diolauge and ask ""Can you get _____ for me?"" (Yes or No) and if you actually go through and get them the item, they will give you so little amount of money it might not even pay for the bullets/medical supplies used to get the item. I can say comfortably that I made more money picking up guns from the people I killed to complete the quest than I get from the guy giving me money to do the quests.
Did I mention there was no fast travel? There are ways you can make yourself sprint longer. (Also you cant say you cant be driven by someone in a truck to a major town because you are literally in a truck in the intro. No excuse.)
One last thing that's worse than all of the quest issues combined, all of your quests have a fucking time limit. Yup, one ingame day and you will have to walk your sorry ass back to who ever you got that mission from to get the mission again. Fuck that.

[u] B-B-B-UT YOU FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT THE MODS [/u]
Yeah, I know there are mods out there that fix most of the games problems, but that's one thing that really rubs me the wrong way. Just like any single player game, I could install more mods and triple the games file size and make the combat a hell of a lot better. But let me ask you this, does that mean the game is good, or does that mean the modders are fucking insanely talented with coding and game design, even arguably better than the developers at times?

This game is definitely a cult classic for a reason. It's atmosphere is oppressive and incredibly unique. The world feels full of danger everywhere you turn, but that makes the friendly faces you find all the sweeter. 
The combat is a bit hard to get used to though, and starting you out with the least accurate weapon in the game probably wasn't the best choice, but it does get a lot better. You will mostly be fighting other humans, but the encounters with some of the more rare mutants are definite highlights.
On the bad side though, the game can be a bit unstable. Most of the bugs I found were more bewildering than annoying, but the game did crash quite a few times.
