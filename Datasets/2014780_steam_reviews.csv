The ""earth"" was a green expanse with white lines denoting runways.  I thought this was marvellous and sent my wire frame aircraft up over the green expanse below.
Since that time I had almost every version of MS Flight Simulator, Prepar 3D, FSX, FSX Acceleration, IL Sturmovik, World of Flight and some I can't even remember.  Even Combat Flight Simulator!
With the demise of FSX, I really thought that was the end of my flight simming days.  Then I discovered X-Plane.  OK, I only started on X-Plane 11 and immediately  loved it.  After doing thousands of hours I was satisfied with only loading Africa scenery.  I took the decision to stay only in Africa, and South Africa.  Not that I have anything against other parts of the world, but I spent many, many hours in Europe, the USA, Oceania and now at my age, i settled down to my own country.  And I love every moment of it!
The sheer pleasure of trying different aircraft, amazed at the time and energy developers put into it.  The precision of the avionics, the hours spent on perfecting the different aircraft was staggering! I did not even have to look at other flight simulator platforms.  X-Plane had it all.
Lastly.  Austin Meyer became a household name in the x-plane community.  I can't remember a senior developer exposing himself as much and putting in as much as Austin.  Something I did not experience with all the other available flight simulator platforms.

The bugs seem infinite, the crashes are unpredictable, and is very underwhelming. The default Garmin avionics are atrocious and are genuinely shameful. 

Don't even get me started on the clouds or rain. I wish I could attach photos to this review to show how shitty they look. It also has this weird visual bug where around dawn and dusk, the clouds are blacker than midnight, but your plane is so bright it looks like it has a thousand suns on it. It's a real shame. 

I've dumped a lot of money into this game. The main planes I fly on here on the FF767, Rotate MD11, E175, and Phenom 300. It sucks because these are all genuinely good aircraft, but whats the point of them when you're sim is so unstable and trashy looking that you lose all immersion? When I should be worried about altitude constraints on an approach, I'm more worried about my PC blue screening (which has happened several times while playing XP12). I mean MSFS is a 100x better looking game than X-Plane, but X-Plane's FPS is about 5x lower. It's ridiculous. Speaking of MSFS which has full satellite imaging, this does not. You need to get Ortho, which will then knock your FPS down about another 15fps, and take up terabytes worth of storage. 

The literally only good thing I have to say about this game is the default airports and the physics engines. You can feel the wind gusts, you can anticipate the float or the sink with flap extension/retraction. The default airports look great and gate placement is on point nearly everytime. That's it though. If you want your money's worth, get MSFS 2020. My biggest complaint is just the clouds. I can put up with the 5 same repeating grids of farm fields over a thousand mile flight, but I mean the clouds gave like this glacier glitch where they look like literal glaciers and sometimes extend past like 42,000 feet which pretty much only happens in thunderstorms, but I mean these things are fucking everywhere it drives me nuts. 

Edit (7-28-23): There has been a recent update on the public beta that has greatly improved the clouds visuals (though they are still far from good.) The clouds no longer look black near dawn or dusk and lighting is improved in IMC conditions, but there is still tearing present when moving through clouds or fog. Will continue to update this thread as more updates are released.

Edit (2-15-24): This sim has earned an ""alright"" position in my view, and I would at this state in the game recommend it to some who are looking for a sim with a superior flight model and more aircraft available compared to MSFS 2020. I don't buy sims for the sims. I buy sims for the aircraft that utilize the sim. XPlane has by far the most study-level aircraft available for any flight sim, all produced by fantastic devs. While the sim is still far from perfect, it's gotten to a point where clouds and overall performance have noticeably improved. MSFS 2020 will always be my go to simply for the scenery, I have noticed that X-Plane has become my go-to sim for when I want a more realistic flight sim.

- No truly noticeable terrain visual or mesh upgrade since XP9 (really bad compared to MSFS)

Compared to MSFS:

MSFS is better at
- Scenery - unique technology which results in astonishing terrain out of the box
- More stable program (XP is still somewhat prone to bugs,  crashes as it is on much older technological platform -  addons and plugins contribute to this)
- I have limited experience with MSFS weather but XP's default weather is  terrible at the moment (differs from real life, some effects like rain are too extensively applied)

XP12 is better at
- Vivid ecosystem of addons, enhancements, plugins. What had been the strength of FSX, is on XP's side -  development studios with tradition.  Open ended, lots of tinkering to do,  you can even create your own python scripts if you feel inclined. MSFS is limited to a single marketplace.
- Therefore, a wider selections of payware aircrafts  to fly.
- More realistic aircraft systems and flight dynamics. Overall feel is simulation-like, not console game (although, I couldn't tell if in-flight dynamics  are more realistic).
- Clean UI optimized for PC, compared to the pain in the ass Xbox mess which MSFS offers
- Lower  requirements to run at high quality.
- More realistic feel in terms  of visuals, not as cartoonish as MSFS. Even though default scenery is not too high fidelity, it can be improved by ortho.

Overall, I'm very happy with XPlane series, probably the  best sim overall (compared to other flight, train, bus, truck titles). Get XP as your main sim and occasionally fly MSFS for VFR sightseeing.

I've played X Plane since v10 so I'm not exactly a veteran however I can say that switching to XP10 from Flight Simulator X was a fair upgrade. After playing v10 and later v11 I yearned for more realistic textures, graphics and sound modelling. Yes this is all possible with payware and some freeware plugins but I wasn't at the stage where I wanted to spend the big bucks on high fidelity aircraft and scenery. Eventually Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 rolled around and with substantial PC upgrades completed I was ready to dive in. The graphics were breath taking and the weather system was down right epic. However the default aircraft (one of the most important aspects of any flight simulator) felt very shallow and intended for 'gamers' rather than 'simmers' (at this point I was still using the Zibo 737 on XP11 which was the depth of simulation I was looking for). Yes Asobo began to flesh out their planes and made improvements to the sim overall but I could never take it seriously compared to X Plane. X Plane feels like a hardcore flight simulator. The aircraft feel real and heavy (especially in v12 with the A330) and the new weather system in v12 allow you to practice real world flying conditions more accurately. I am very impressed with the out of the box graphics of v12, granted you will need a pretty fast PC to run it on high settings at an acceptable frame rate. The default aircraft in v12 are leagues above what v11 had with this reason alone making it worth the upgrade. The scenary is also quite impressive considering it's not satellite streamed. I tend to find that the placement of airport structures in X Plane 12 and the overall look of them compared to there real life counterparts are far superior to those offered in MSFS2020 (obviously not the handcrafted ones the developers create every world update). The U.I I whilst not as modern looking as MSFS2020 I find works better and is far more functional to use in flight. The ATC system in v12 is also far superior to the default one in MSFS2020.
I will always come back to X Plane 12 because it just has certain 'vibe' that in my eyes, Microsoft Flight Simulator cannot replicate alone. Well done Austin and the team at Laminar for creating a simulator that really captures the feeling of flying an aircraft whether that be an A330-300 or an F14 TOMCAT. This is a feat that very few have achieved and for that I highly recommend this simulator to anyone who is even slightly considering purchasing it.",1706356172,1706356172,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing that bothers me is there is always more rain than there should be - like you set real weather and it's not raining in real world, it is raining in the sim, you set manual weather to scattered clouds with no precipitation, and it is raining in the sim.
The game has frozen two times for me because of a mod and crashed one time (probably also because of a mod, but I wasn't able to reproduce it yet)

Building on the foundation of its predecessors, X-Plane 12 presents a very impressive flight simulation experience. The continuously improved graphics rendering engine provides lifelike environments, dynamic lighting, and realistic weather effects. Landscapes, airports, and aircraft models are meticulously detailed, making for an immersive experience.

True to the X-Plane series' reputation, X-Plane 12 offers cutting-edge flight physics. The flight dynamics feel authentic, and the feedback from controls is immediate and precise. Complex systems simulation ensures that both general aviation aircraft and heavy jets are recreated with high fidelity.

I've spent several hundred hours in MSFS, now switched almost exclusively to X-Plane. What you see in the store screenshots above is not how the sim usually looks, they've chosen the best shots. It doesn't mean it looks worse ""in-game"", just that you shouldn't expect the same graphics as in MSFS. However, the graphics are more than good enough for pleasant low-level VFR or high-altitude flights. In addition, as X-Plane reaches version 12.1, you'll see a huge improvement in graphics fidelity.

The biggest difference between this and MSFS is the autogen scenery. While it doesn't look as accurate as Bing maps, it also doesn't have weird blobs and other mapping artifacts and errors. Close up, European cities look very realistic. I am yet to fly in other parts of the world but from what I've seen, they look great too. The world is alive, full of cars, trains, boats, and of course other aircraft. There is an option to stream real elevation and map data like in MSFS (AutoOrtho mod), however the developers are currently re-making the scenery engine anyway.

The flight model appears somewhat more predictable and more realistic than MSFS. You should watch reviews on YouTube for more information. There is an instructor mode, support for networking, AI ATC, real weather, multi-monitor displays, and the like.

I love the selection of included planes and helicopters (even if the included A330 has a Boeing FMS), and the one quadcopter. There are plenty of high-quality freeware planes, helicopters and other vehicles, very detailed scenery, and other addons. I've especially enjoyed the experimental and military planes. X-Plane does support weapons systems, making addons like the Avro Vulcan truly spectacular. 

There are aircraft carriers you can land on or take off from. navy frigates, oil derricks, helipads in cities and near SAR stations. With the instructor mode you could setup complex combat or SAR missions if you're so inclined. Download free biplanes and start dogfights over the Somme riverfront. Deliver cargo, manage emergencies, fly passengers or discover the world for pleasure.

The sim is very well-optimised - it takes about 30 seconds to load on a SATA SSD and you can max out all settings on an RTX4070 or AMD 7600 and fly at a consistent 60fps. You need a joystick or better, a gamepad won't really work. The absolute minimum for a comfortable experience is an RTX3060 or AMD equivalent paired with a 6-core CPU. If you're going to use more detailed scenery, I'd also suggest around 250GB free space, 100Mbit/s connection and faster CPU. The roadmap for 2024 focuses on graphics and optmisation.

X-Plane 12 continues the series' tradition of delivering a realistic, comprehensive, and visually striking flight simulation experience.

Ahora entrando en detalle en X-Plane 12, este tiene un detalle de escenarios muy elevado a mi parecer. Vi videos sobre el X-Plane 12 y parecia tener unos graficos muy inferiores, pero no se si debia a que estaba en desarrollo temprano cuando realizaron los videos, porque la realidad del simulador actualmente no tiene nada que ver, ya que posee unos detalles y escenarios muy buenos. Por ejemplo, cuando te aproximas a un aeropuerto puedes ver los coches por las calles y las casas con mas detalle. Si vuelas de noche es alucinante cuando realizas la aproximacion y aterrizaje en un aeropuerto, puesto que ves todas las calles iluminadas asi como casas y coches. Ademas, los aeropuertos estan muy bien detallados y la iluminacion de los mismos es alucinante.

Quiero hacer especial mencion a la lluvia. Cuando ruedas por el aeropuerto con el sonido de la lluvia asi como los detalles del agua y la pista mojada, los destellos de la luz con la lluvia... increible!

Es cierto que no tiene una gran variedad de aviones pero los que tiene estan muy detallados. Para mi mas que suficiente simplemente con el A330, B737 y MD82 (ademas del F-14 y avionetas entre otros). Sin embargo, son practicamente fully funcionales. El A330, por ejemplo, tiene practicamente todos los botones funcionales (alguno no, obviamente, pero una gran mayoria).

En el apartado de los aviones de combate, puedes simular combates poniendo la cantidad de enemigos o amigos que quieres asi como su dificultad. Decides que aviones quieres que lleven y cual quieres tu (por ejemplo el F-14). Luego pones que misiles quieres llevar y... a divertirte! Se pueden crear unos combates muy interesantes y es la mar de divertido (y eso que de momento solo he hecho un 1vs1 con otro F-14).

Las fisicas del juego son increibles y el movimiento del avion tanto por las turbulencias, por el viento como por los giros que tu realizas son super realistas.

En resumen, recomiendo el juego para todo aquel que quiera darle una vuelta mas de dificultad a la aviacion (aviso que no es tan facil pilotar los aviones en el X-Plane, ya que cualquier rafaga de viento la vas a notar muchisimo en el avion).",1704153739,1704481790,True,0,0,0.495283037424087524,0,True,False,False

For all other newcomers, or more ""casual"" gamers:
X-plane 12 is a fantastic [strike]game[/strike] simulator. However $80 for a base game, + $80 for interesting payware planes/sceneries for a slightly dated overall experience = No, I don't recommend this game to any newcomer to Flight Simulation or the casual gamer.

[hr][/hr]

In general I [strike]like[/strike] love the game, but there are many issues why it is hard to ""recommend"" this game to any (casual) gamer.
Only if you want a real flight experience I recommend this game.

[i]X-Plane is about realism, learn everything about the plane and enjoy flying it. It is a simulator, not a arcade game![/i]

One of my biggest issues is the overall performance of the game: you need top of the line hardware to have a ""smooth"" experience. Even so, the game feels unoptimized and looks absolute dated compared to MSFS2020. (No mather where you fly, everything just looks the same over and over again).

[hr][/hr]

On first release X-plane 12 had a absolute bad start, in turn users (and community developers) switched back to X-plane 11 or to ""other"" sims.

Where X-plane 10 and 11 shined in a community with tons of freeware and payware planes; X-plane 12 is now lacking. Most (if not all) X-plane 11 planes are not fully compatible and the limited quality payware planes (price ranges from $30 to $80), are included in MSFS2020 by default. (The Douglas DC-3 to name one).

[i]NOTE: this was with the beta release, now the game is stable, not subjected to major overhauls of the core engine anymore, so I expect (or hope) that developers will find there way back to X-Plane 12.[/i]


Laminar Research is raising the price for X-plane 12 at the end of this year to $80 in order to ""keep up with the team's demands and fastrack everything within development"".
You can buy (at the time of writing) ""MSFS: 40th Anniversary Premium Deluxe Edition"" for that money. 

Very sad to say, but MSFS is a [i]slightly[/i] beter choice for an overall FS experience (for newcomers).
However, if realism is a major concern, and the world/sceneries are less of importance to you; then I highly recommend X-plane 12!

In my opinion XP12 is the second best FS available, and MSFS is not even a runner up. XP12 is the best general aviation sim. It is the best looking sim, although the ocean waves are still second best. The civilian traffic really brings the world to life, particularly the emergency vehicles. If u just wanna go sight seeing and or learn basic aviation XP12 is probably what you want.

Here are the reasons I feel it is still the second best FS

I like blowing stuff up as much as the next guy but that isnt my primary FS goal. However, there are no collision physics that I have noticed. I realize people might say it's a FS not a crash sim, but as a bush pilot or SAR pilot tree tops and power lines are real hazards so they should be real hazards in the simulator. 

As a SAR pilot it is nice to have a user friendly mission editor. To place a car accident, a stranded hiker in a valley, or burning building is important to me. As it is all those emergency vehicles dont go anywhere or do anything. XP's Mission editing tools are separate, third party plug ins, which are limited and not user friendly. 

For these reasons I am far more likely to spend my money on DCS mods than XP12 mods.",1704044876,1704044876,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

But, it's really hard to start your second flight and land at the closest airport different than Portland.

Then, you contact Seattle to request a landing after watching a really nice mountain, and flying head to head with it (NE from Portland). So you try to descend, your speed is still 100 knots and the airfield runway is so short you hope for a good breaks in your landing gear, so you map your controller's left trigger to 'Speedbr(e)ake' and try to land... Althought the tower in Seattle don't want to talk to you anymore, because you accidentally hit the readback button you mapped, or whatever... Last thing they asked was to climb to 4000 feet, probably to decrease your speed, but they never asked about your fuels status, so you already see this short runway and do your best... Nevermind me, it's just my opinion.

X-Plane 12 is a huge improvement from X-Plane 11, but DO NOT EXPECT MSFS GRAPHICS or anything close to such. Laminar did a great job on fixing some of the major issues, such as the unnatural shorelines and the blocky suburbs with chunks missing, as well as better world sattelite. They also added a plethora of new realistic building designs and props, making industrial, suburban, and downtown areas a lot nicer to look at. The airports also have new assets, including taxiways and buildings, etc. which make the feeling of taxi, takeoff, and landing much more realistic. However, there are still some issues that I have found with the graphics, such as there are WAY too many golf courses in some areas, and the edges of airports still mostly do not blend into the rest of the world, save major airports or airports with boundaries (highways, fences, etc.). Additionally, some biomes still sometimes seem copy-paste, while others are beautiful, and there is sometimes transitions that appear jagged from 30,000 feet. There is also the issue of the jagged roads, but it has improved some from 11 and is not very noticeable. In terms of frame rate, I have a pretty powerful computer, so I didn't get many reduced frames. In fact, I was running max settings with 30+ fps (I can't on 11), so there has obviously been optimization. If you're struggling with frames, I recommend turning texture quality and anti-aliasing down if you want to keep max render distance and max building density, especially around larger airports at night.

In terms of physics, it is still the same great X-Plane that trumps the physics department every day of the week. There's not much to talk about here, just that the physics engine is the best in any flight simulator.

Talking sound, the sound is a fair improvement from 11. The A330 is my favorite, the engine spool on takeoff sounds awesome, while the 737 and C750 are both realistic. You can definitely tell they worked more on the sound design in 12, because the improvements are there. I haven't used many of the props, but from what I hear from others they sound nice.

The default aircraft have seen imrovements, I haven't flown the A330 but I hear its pretty good after the FMC fix. The C750 is nice as well, but the AP and FMC are a little complicated. The SR22 is a great aircraft, you can tell they spent some time on it. Overall the new aircraft are fairly good additions, just buggy for now.

To conclude, if you have X-Plane 11, and are deciding between XP12 and MSFS, get MSFS if you want a beautiful graphical experience, but XP12 is a much more balanced sim, with better flight systems and adequate graphics compared to MSFS.",1703612259,1703612259,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Paying $80... for a Beta? Here's hoping that after all this time that there have been improvements, especially to VR. Otherwise, not the *best* look to do a price increase and leave other features to the wayside, in my opinion. As well as the lack of any Early Access tag or notice on the Steam page. A Beta is not a completed game.

Original Review - November 2022:
Beta 14 review of VR using a Quest 2, Virtual Desktop, and an RTX 3070.

On a bright side, compared to MSFS, at least VR actually works, is 3D, and that I can actually push pretty much every button I see in the introductory plane.

The cons I've experienced though are the following.
- [Main Game] Tried to launch from a North American airport after it was supposedly installed, and it's just water everywhere. There's no clear way to install it as it just opens the game when attempting to download that pack. That's a big red flag if you're a MONTH (or less) away from release when your entire scenery doesn't load outside of wherever the tutorial is located.
- [VR] The text on the panels in the cockpit are literally unreadable blobs of something that you could assume to be text, but who knows.
- [VR] You can't skip the Introductory cutscene without taking your VR headset off and clicking the ""Skip Intro"" button on the desktop.
- [VR] The biggest issue for me is that the game literally told me my graphics settings were too high to run VR because of frame rate issues. Now I didn't notice any FPS issues, but as I said in my first point, the text is literally a blob on the physical panels. I couldn't even read what I assume to be a warning label on the glass.

For now, I'll wait until the full game comes out and see what people think, and how it performs. Also, if you're going to promote Multiplayer, PLEASE include it in the Steam listing, unless it's only LAN co-op.",1669595834,1703467160,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I certainly didn't hesitate to get it when it came out and haven't regretted it since. But the single reason why I got it? Because MSFS stopped working on my system, no matter what. And because it actually has Linux support, whilst MSFS only works sometimes. I have since learned to love X-Plane (first 11, then 12) again, after more or less leaving X-Plane 10 when MSFS came around.

First of all, there's the obvious ""issue"": the visual quality. The step up from X-Plane 11 is huge in some areas, barely noticeable others. Also, there obviously are no orthos by default. But that is, where X-Plane really shines. There is a lot missing ""by default"", but there is even more to add. At this point I probably have more than one TB of Scenery and Orthos for X-Plane 12 and gotten many sceneries that wouldn't have been available for MSFS. Sure, many still look way worse and can not be as complex due to sim limitations, but at least for me, they're mostly 'good enough'. 

Performance unfortunately is quite bad. MSFS delivers way better performance, even though the visuals also are quite a bit better. Still, this is a flight simulator and I am fine with flying my airliner at 17-35fps, depending on the situation. But that is the problem: most people are not. Most people do not want to install mods in order to have a somewhat decent experience, most people do not want to use Ortho4XP to create their own Orthos, most people do not want to read the logs, because something broke again for whatever reason (although the sim is super stable, way more than MSFS, if you just leave it alone and don't break it with hundreds of mods). That is why most people buy MSFS, not X-Plane 12.

If you are someone who is willing to tinker a bit with the software and don't simply want to press fly (altough the menus have evolved quite a bit from, say, X-Plane 10...), you will get a sim that is quite amazing, to be honest. There are many high-quality AddOns (Planes, Sceneries, Plugins...) available, both paid and free. On the free side there of course is the Zibo, but there are many more. Unfortunately, many do not work in X-Plane 12 (yet), but what has been created for X-Plane 11 vastly exceeds what there is available for MSFS. Without paying a cent, you were able to get a really nice Swearingen Metroliner and also more obscure planes, such many high-quality soviet ones, plain many you just can't get for MSFS - at least not in this quality. And then there are all the amazing payware AddOns: the amazing Q4XP, iniBuilds' A300s, the entire ToLiss line, Flightfactor and so on. There's just almost everything available with at least a reasonable quality. Also, the planes feel great. Of course I can't vouch for how real they all are, but they certainly feel more 'alive' than many in MSFS do.

So: Is it worth buying? For me: totally. For most people: maybe not. If you are fine with the big issues mentioned: absolutely, it's a great sim, just not as much of a mass-market product. If this is a good or a bad thing is up to you.",1701110087,1703330501,True,26,0,0.740710258483886719,0,True,False,False

It is also incredible just how little the series has advanced in terms of something so basic as camera positions and following AI traffic. The graphics themselves; even on max settings, certainly do not impress much...I mean they are bearable; but I was far more impressed by the 2013 leap done by DCS or the 2004 leap done by MSFS 2004 than what I see here; particularly when we talk about environment/buildings....they look very, very 2006/7.

Also something ridiculously annoying is that the main menu option disappears if you enter a flight; so you have to exit to desktop and re-launch the game to change any menu options...WHY.

Finally the performance of the game is ABYSMAL; one area where I guess it reaches equivalency with 2006 era flight sims. Also the Vulkan API makes pretty much zero difference on performance. Not running a slouch rig either (i9 10920X/ 32GB 3200Mhz RAM/ RTX 3080Ti 12GB/ Game running off a PCIE SSD). Be prepared for a LOT of freezes and CTDs; it makes me think this game has a major memory leak.

You are better off buying an earlier version of the series at a cheaper price because in terms of options and graphics this is not what I would call a noticeable improvement.

The graphics are mind blowing compared to XP11, and the physics still feel perfect, unlike Microsoft Flight Simulator. XP12 I find is also quite optimised compared to XP11. I belive this is due to the Vulkan rendering system. In XP11 I could run Medium to high graphics around 20-30FPS, where as now I am on almost max graphics and get a solid 45-55FPS.

The error was telling me that my card ran out of VRAM. So, I was feeling quite happy about an AMD 7900xtx upgrade, as I liked the very high settings, and the 7900xtx has AT LEAST the same over all processing power as my old 3080, and a ton of VRAM to go with it. However, this game won't properly use the AMD GPU. It is running at 100 percent, but the fames are half that of the 3080 on the same settings. Frame rates in VR are unplayable. Also, in case it isn't obvious I have the same CPU as I did with the 3080. I have not downgraded it. MSFS 2020 on very high settings is giving up to 78 FPS in some cities, and around 50 worst case scenario on the flat. In VR in New York (my test place) I get 38fps in MSFS2020 with this card. This was the kind of performance I had gotten in my 3080 in XP12(and the 7900xtx performance in MSFS2020 is DRASTICALLY better than the 3080 was.), however it crashed a lot, as I stated it said it was running out of VRAM. This game was pretty good on the 3080, when not crashing, but on the 7000 series it isn't good at all. BTW I prefer the lighting in X-plane 12 to MSFS 2020. I also think the clouds and other things look better, and more realistic. For example even though the buildings are extremely cookie cutter by default, the grass and trees don't seem to make everything look like a post apocalyptic world. The roads generally stay above the water and the cars generally drive on top of them. There are little touches like cars in the parking lots also. The reason I don't recommend this game is that it simply doesn't work on the one year old AMD GPUs. If you have one you are literally just throwing your money in the trash can for VR. On the flat I get a sim game only playable 24fps on high settings in NY, NY. So you know turning down the settings I am willing to part with does not seem to help much. I bought this card to max out the world objects and render distance. Both of which worked on the 3080 in terms of frame rate, but the game crashed due to lack of VRAM. While I am sure I could turn these settings down, that kind of defeats the point of the expensive upgrade.

To those who aren't aware, there's a lot of content on their forums (https://forums.x-plane.org/).

While the Cessna 152 isn't included in the base game, I got a free copy of it from there (https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/87790-zl-simulation-cessna-152-xp11-xp12/).

Review:

X-Plane is an absolute gem for anyone passionate about aviation and flight simulation. This simulator goes above and beyond in delivering a realistic and immersive flying experience. Here's why X-Plane deserves all the awards:

Unparalleled Realism: X-Plane's flight physics and aircraft modeling are second to none. The attention to detail is outstanding, making each aircraft feel like a true-to-life counterpart. The realism extends to weather conditions, providing a challenging yet rewarding experience.

Extensive Aircraft Library: The vast selection of aircraft available in X-Plane is a testament to the developer's commitment to diversity. From commercial airliners to small GA planes, each one is meticulously crafted with an eye for detail. The availability of both modern and classic aircraft adds to the simulator's versatility.

Dynamic Weather System: X-Plane's dynamic weather system adds a whole new layer of immersion. Real-world weather patterns, turbulence, and dynamic lighting contribute to an authentic flying experience. It's as close as you can get to flying without leaving the comfort of your home.

Active Community and Modding Support: The X-Plane community is thriving, and the support for mods and third-party content is exceptional. This means you can continually enhance and customize your simulator, adding new aircraft, scenery, and features to keep your experience fresh and exciting.

VR Integration: X-Plane's compatibility with VR technology elevates the simulation to new heights. Flying in virtual reality adds a level of immersion that must be experienced to be truly appreciated. It's a game-changer for those with VR setups.

In conclusion, X-Plane on Steam is a must-have for anyone serious about flight simulation. The level of realism, the extensive aircraft library, dynamic weather, active community, and VR integration make it a standout choice. Give it a try, and you'll quickly understand why X-Plane deserves all the awards it can get!",1700891899,1700891899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been playing MSFS2020 for a while now.  I was annoyed when I found out the planes I wanted were locked behind a $90 paywall, but noticed that both of them (737 and steam guage Cessna 172) were available in X Plane.  After spending a lot of time with the demos in X-Plane 11 and 12, I bought 11. For a while I had MSFS2020 if I wanted a beautiful but limited flight simulator that sometimes crashed if I played it for more than 4 hours straight, and X-Plane 11 if I wanted a stable realistic experience that I could run off on HDD while having 30 browser tabs open and not even use up 50% of my GPU.  

X-Plane 12 doesn't really fill either of those roles.  It's not nearly as pretty as MFS2020 but it will not let your graphics card know that.  It's an absolute performance hog with a loading screen time to rival MSFS and worse graphics. Also don't even bother trying to play this without an SSD.  However before I get more into that let's talk about what this game does right. 

The Flight model in this game is unmatched.  It's extremely responsive and realistic.  There's a lot of things that you can get away with in MSFS that won't work in this simulator.  The thing I love so much about it is in MSFS your landings are either crash landings or good landings. In X-Plane your landings are NEVER perfect. There's always room for improvement. The game lets you know if you stick the landing too hard, you hear a loud ""bang"" on the wheels.  Rudder control and throttle control is extremely sensitive and responsive. As soon as you land you will be thinking about all the things you could have done better, and unlike MSFS there is a really easy to use functioning replay tool so you can see exactly where you need to improve. Spending any amount of time in X-Plane will make you a better pilot.  I really have to give a hats off to the Piper Cub model in this game. It's amazingly fun and challenging to fly, but not in a frustrating way like the Sentinal L5.  It also comes with VOR Navigation so you can fly it in a storm.  This plane alone is why I will not be refunding this game despite having some issues with it.  That and the Cessna Citation X are worth the price of admission to me.  

My main issue with this game is that it doesn't really improve that much over X-Plane 11. Yes the graphics are better, but they still aren't great, yes the physics model is a bit better, and to me that was worth the $40 I payed for it, but for a full price game? The main issue is that there are 2 significant flaws to this game that X-Plane 11 does not have. One like I said is performance. This game throttles my GPU harder than MSFS does and doesn't have the graphics to justify it.  The second flaw with this game, and honestly the sole reason I give it a thumbs down is the lighting.  For some reason the devs decided to put such heavy shadowing in the game that it completely obscures your cockpit instruments.  It's absolutely awful.  The cockpit is just difficult to see. This decision seems to be inspired by watching youtube videos of people flying and not actually doing it.  No pilot worth their salt would take a plane up if they can't see the damn instruments.  You can buy tiny little lights at walmart for $2 to fix this problem in real life, but in the game there is literally no way to fix it. The flashlight doesn't work well in the day, and there is literally no option in the options menu to crank up the brightness or gamma, which to me is just inexcusable.  Your only option is to crank the brightness on your monitor.  There are no mods afaik to fix this issue either. The devs are convinced that this is ""realistic"" and have basically told the players to live with it. For that they get a big fat thumbs down from me. This decision actually makes X-Plane 12 a worse simulator that X-Plane 11, because XP11 does not have this problem.  Worse yet they plan on raising the price of this game to $80 without fixing this glaring (pun intended) issue. Get real. 

If you are new to X-Plane then get XP11. It's cheaper, will run better and you can actually see the cockpit. If you want a pretty game then get MSFS.  If you have both of those games and want the most realistic flight model out there, and have a good computer, then I'd say this game is pretty good, but again, have fun not being able to see the instruments unless you crank the brightness on your monitor.

In the meantime I was hooked to FSX and FS2020 (+3000hrs). 
What should I say... here I am and I will stay! I never thought that this would happen this fast.

Why? 


FS is more polished, more beautiful, more comfortable, the world, scene and aircrafts look much better....

XP12 is WAY harder, more complicated, less beautiful, less comfortable BUT
(as a simulation) WAY better! How can this be?
The flight physics, controls and dynamics are incredible awesome. The weather impact too.
You`ve got +1000 hrs in FS and you think you are a master pilot? Try XP12 and you will
find yourself back at the school desk. Flying feels MUCH more realistic than in FS. It is MUCH harder and this is great! 

XP has some advantages:

- realism
- physics
- flight ""feeling"", aircraft controls
- highly customizeable
- great mod base
- more stable than FS (for me)
- vanilla state features
- damage simulation
- controller setup

XP12 has many improved features now
- ground control
- radio/ATC
- LOD and light
- sound

I love it!

Even though I get less frames per second in XPlane, the controls feel much more responsive than in MSFS. The aircraft behavior feels incredibly realistic. For example, if you fly upside down or in a very steep incline, fuel supply will fail and the engine shut off in high wing aircraft that don't use an electric fuel pump. Also, I had the turn coordinator stuck after performing some exceptionally daft maneuvers, something that can happen in real world scenarios as well.

Personally, the changes from xplane 11 to 12 for me arent that big although my graphic card surely disagrees apparently, usually run 35-40fps in new york city on a 3070ti what I found strange is that I get the same FPS in VR which well should be more demanding but I dont know something isnt right performance wise and hope it gets ruffed out. Heard the price is rising from 60 to 80 soon and hope that money is well invested into making xplane 12 better and hope they dont plan to make a xplane 13  anytime soon and use xplane 12 as a base because honestly that would cause me to loose hope in Xplane.

X-PLANE 12 HAS A HIGH QUALITY F-14 
First and most importantly, for me the F-14, new Alia bVtol plane and MD-80 alone make X-plane 12 worth a buy. They are all fun to fly regardless of X-plane's other less than ideals. 

SCENERY
Out of the box, MSFS is known for it's photorealistic and 3D scenery so while X-plane 12 isn't winning this one, it still has its special charm. 

EASIER TO BIND KEYS TO A JOYSTICK IN X-PLANE
X-plane controls are easier use and bind to a joystick/yoke.  Overall, MSFS feels clunky compared to X-plane  (Perhaps because MSFS is catering toward console users?) 
Additionally, X-plane 12 lets you easily assign custom external views while MSFS does not by default (without moving the cockpit camera out of the cockpit which is annoying)

ATC
ATC has improved since X-plane of the past but it still needs work to catch up to the functionality and sound quality of MSFS. 

X-plane HAS COMBAT AND SPECIAL STARTS such as landing on an Aircraft carrier and formation flying.

SEASONS ARE A NICE TOUCH yet could use tweaking to accurately represent regions better (example: The west coast of California shouldn't have red/orange trees--they mostly have redwoods/evergreens forests)

NEW LIGHTING looks great. 
CLOUDS don't always look the best (even on highest quality) but they are certainly better than X-plane 11. 

SUMMARY
X-plane 12 has a sweet charm and feel about it that MSFS doesn't have (so that's why I like both)

in terms of performance, it plays quite well on my 2022 macbook air (surprisingly) on decently high graphics. in that case, if you're playing on a PC, you will have little to no trouble playing this on maximum graphics.

scenery? from what i've heard, it's nowhere close to Microsoft's which is unfortunate, but it is still very good to look at, especially the clouds. the new volumetric 3d clouds adds a heart to the game that others games miss a lot.

Flight dynamics are better across the board. Far more customizable than MSFS. Views work better, since the anchor is to the X axis of the view rather than the aircraft center (meaning you can more easily jump around on a complex airliner panel). ATC is better, and ground services are better: MSFS has a push-back operator waiting to help you in a Cessna at an untowered airport -- X-Plane 12 does not, which matches real life. ATC also works better in X-Plane 12 since the latest updates. It also does not need to be connected to the internet to play, since there is no photogrammetry -- it instead renders a plausible representation of terrain, and frankly it does it quite well. Clouds are also pretty in the latest update (12.07 as of this review).

There are improvements to be made: AI aircraft is still somewhat clunky so realistic traffic levels are somewhat unattainable at the moment.

Flight models are better than MSFS and the scenery and graphics can easily be made to compete. From reading online, many users are switching to Xplane. There are also new lighting and rain effects. I haven't had a single crash in over 30 hours.

As a former commercial pilot who needs realism, this checks all the boxes for me. There are some amazing free addons including the Zibo 737 and Sparky's 747 which will keep you busy for a long time and other high quality addons for purchase. There are lots of free scenery packs (ie. Vancouver, London, etc.) so you don't have to buy extra scenery.

If you're new to Xplane as I was, it will take a bit of time to figure out how to install plugins and aircraft, but the effort is well worth it.

To save new users some time, here is a list of addons etc. that everyone should have:
AutoOrtho
SimHeaven scenery
BetterPushBack
AviTab
TerrainRadar
Little XConnect (for Vatsim)
HD Trees
Zibo 737
Sparky 747
Little Nav Map (free flight planning software)

Payware addons that are on my wishlist:
Hot Start Challenger 650 (ranked as the best addon for any flight sim ever)
Toliss A340-600
Carenado Pa31 Navajo with the Reality Expansion Pack
Colimata Concorde

Overall, this sim is amazing and I give it my highest recommendation. It's the best flight sim available.

Can now activate the Mouse Wheel Square for the Yoke'  and place any corner away from central view line, for the virtual buttons, on board flight controls. Easier to activate or deactivate the Wheel now, for mouse, 

Will I invest more in this game? Maybe not the expensive airport upgrades, unless we get snow regions fulfilled.  That is the main part that is missing from this is the ice wall, weather.  
Although I will be looking to purchase the Concorde alongside an actual Wheel, if the key is not implemented.

Took me 80 hours to learn the fighter jets and Airbus, around 160 hours to learn 737 near altitude mountains, during storms etc.  I certainly will keep checking the updates as the Devs are really passionate about aviation, mod communities and constantly improving this sim'.  Whilst catering to Apple users, as well (for our higher res' monitors).

Would be even better when the sat'  terrain scan tech' mod' is finished and hopefully implemented, for real.  That is one part that is missing, Although the roads are almost exact in the city and edge of towns areas,  It still looks amazing at night, although some landmarks like clock towers, are missing.  Which is unfortunate but at least the Devs are working on this game day in and day out, adding landmarks along with the near by airport DLCs.  

I give X-Plane a 99 / 100 (since other reviews are inflated and overhyped right now.  Get this instead, support the community and if this was fully online, I would honestly have given a full 10 out of 10.

I have zero issues with other games and 11 worked wonderfully. I've already purchased aircraft in 12 that I don't think work in 11 (rotary wing). I don't use a joystick as I feel it breaks immersion.

Let's talk about controlling the aircraft. The devs didn't take the time to think about users with just keyboard and mouse. Nearly impossible to taxi and steer the aircraft with a mouse. Oh yeah not including they use the yoke or sideclick for steering with mouse which is totally inaccurate.  

They need far better input for mouse and keyboard users. They have good support for Xbox controller, yokes, and peddles. In MSFS I use W and S for elevators to lift the aircraft off and on the runway. A and D for the aileron to rotate the aircraft and control the aircraft, and for Yaw which in real life steers a aircraft Enter and Home.  Oh, yeah don't forget you have to pay for a subscription to use updated Nav info sure don't have to do that with MSFS.

Each update I see no real improvements just the same fps and the same application stop responding problem.

The FPS is a joke in the game compared to in MSFS 
The aircraft are far better detailed in MSFS than in this 
I can find my home in MSFS not in this 
I can play VR in MSFS without it crashing I can't in this crashed on me the other day, and Vr is just horrible in the mess.
I have more aircraft in MSFS worth flying only 2 good ones in this.

I'm sure users who have been with XP for 10 years will have a different view. XP12 was my first, and it falls short in too many areas considering the competition. 

The performance plain sucks. For the graphics, it's completely unacceptable. There's no way around that. And that's not even talking about the ortho or terrain. Simple things like anti aliasing just don't work or work horribly. If it must look like it's straight out of 2006 then at least the FPS and reliability should be rock solid but they aren't. God forbid you decide to use your system for anything else in cruise because when XP runs low on resources it just crashes. 

The add-on structure is completely nonsensical and needlessly complicated. I should not have to worry about load orders and editing text files to make sure everything is in the right order or else it doesn't work. Extremely lazy implementation by the developer. It's so stupidly complicated that there is an entire suite of products built around not having to deal with it (which also do not work and still requires manual tweaking).

The lower quality graphics are *good enough* in my opinion for a flight sim. I would expect, however, that a sim whose graphics are closer to MSFS 2004 than MSFS 2020 would also have a significant performance advantage over the fancier graphics. Instead, I was getting about 10fps in VR on a PC that is bottle-necked by an NVidia 3090. That combines poorly with the terrible VR headtracking behavior that keeps your head pinned at a single point in the cockpit (rather than letting you pan your head around as well as rotate). I am not someone easily prone to VR sickness but 10 minutes flying a traffic pattern in X-Plane 12 had me ready to hurl.

When launching X-Plane 12 I am set straight into a tutorial without a chance to first configure controls. I started the sim up in VR. The text describing the tutorial and the button to exit VR are not visible or clickable from VR on this initial startup, and everything is extremely confusing and nauseating until you take the headset off to see what is going on. It took me about 20 minutes of trouble shooting trying to get the mouse to work in VR before I went and set up my VR controllers, which I do not use for MSFS or DCS World.

Like there are few aspects in which X-Plane might have a bit of an upper hand, like the lighting inside cockpit, rain effects, bit more in-depth VR interactions, working plane weapons & plane destruction & also some really great payware planes, which are not in MSFS yet.

But for an AAA flight sim, X-Plane 12 lacks a lot in basic polish & fidelity, you could probably turn it into decent flight sim experience, using a lot of mods, but the overall out-of-the-box experience is something that could stand on its own like a decade ago, but now its just not up to par.

It's not surprising that X-Plane 12 detects widely used flight simming hardware, it's surprising that X-Plane 12 does not have default control presets for them and so you have to set up everything, it does not just work OOTB like MSFS.
Flight model is not as deeply simulated as in MSFS, and you can really feel the difference in a negative way coming from MSFS.

The biggest difference from MSFS is the world, with all the free & open mapping data that is currently available you would expect game world of flight sim to be somewhat accurate to reality, but that's unfortunately not the case with X-Plane 12, like flying over my town I could not recognize it except couple of roads, but so much of randomly placed trees, so random placement of buildings, I just cannot see VFR as a viable option playing this ""sim"" and that ultimately lead me to refund it. And yes I understand I could mod it to make it more true to reality, but I just could not be bothered, if the devs of the sim do not care enough to provide that already OOTB, its a shame, but definitely not a reason for me to waste my time on doing their job.",1688577776,1688577776,False,2,2,0.47507360577583313,0,True,False,False

Have you already played X-Plane 11? More specifically, are you already in the X-Plane ecosystem?
If you have already invested into X-Plane 11 addons, and you enjoy the sim, then I think it's worth it.

If you are new to simming, then I recommend MSFS 2020. I like X-Plane a lot, but I believe that the attention from developers and addons in that sphere will eventually surpass X-Plane, more or less.

Graphics:
Obviously MSFS wins without a doubt. However, coming from X-Plane 11, 12 still feels like enough of a jump up for me to appreciate it.

A couple outstanding issues I should address: The clouds look wonky, puffy and overly vibrant. They only look good on high/max settings.

Unlike 11, the cockpits in 12 look overly dark. Both of these issues will hopefully be addressed by Laminar soon.

Physics:
X-Plane wins in my opinion. It feels more realistic and dynamic. MSFS has come a long way and is still decent, but feels comparatively on rails.

Addons:
Right now, it's a tie.
I believe that MSFS will exceed X-Plane, but for now you should consider which type of simming you want to do. If you like airliners, MSFS. A320, 737, ATR, etc are better, with a couple exceptions (CH600, 767/757, A320NEO). If you like General aviation or other turboprops like the Q400, X-Plane all the way.

You might want to note that some of the best airliners are still only in P3D (747, 777, and A320 arguably), which is an outdated money pit, but if you are only interested in a specfic plane, then you might want to consider that.

Weather engines and utilities are decent in both sims.

UI:
I DESPISE the UI in MSFS 2020. The music, unnecessary animations and sounds, and cluttered menus are counter-intuitive for a flight sim. I get that it's supposed to appeal to more casual players, but if you are the least bit serious then I think you will find it annoying.

X-Plane on the other hand is simple, straightforward, and intuitive. They have removed some options from 11 like flat runways if that irks you.

VR:
X-Plane wins since support is native in the sim and common for most addons.
It's possible in MSFS but it's unintutive and you have to jump through enough hoops that I never bothered using it. Regarding VR in general, if you are serious about flight training then I highly recommend using it.",1688448902,1688448902,True,68,0,0.854342639446258545,0,True,False,False

If you want a better X-Plane 11 get X-Plane 12, if you want a more advanced flight simulator look at MSFS 2024 coming next year.

The Cessna Citation-X in X-Plane 12 is very detailed and since you can spend $60 on a detailed 3rd party aircraft for MSFS 2020, why not just get X-Plane 12 for the same price? You get other planes and the X-Plane 12 flight dynamics allows modelling many failure modes not present in MSFS 2020.

Laminar Research really shot themselves in the foot with this release. I still give a positive review in hopes that they truly make the flight simulator ""more advanced and more accurate"". Right now I'm not convinced that they have the ability to innovate in this domain.

[u][b] INTRO [/b][/u]

I was a big fan of X-Plane 11 so I waited until ""full release"" and bought X-Plane 12. I will be comparing this product with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 because they are the same price.

[u][b] CONS [/b][/u]

X-Plane 12 weather and lighting has been improved but the METAR you get from the X-Plane 12 simulator doesn't match that in real life like it does in MSFS 2020. Active runways and winds are always different then what you can get from Google, so if you plan flights using 3rd party METAR and SkyVector the flight will be different in X-Plane 12. MSFS 2020 just works with this respect.

I still get regular crashes using the ""Replay Mode"" to replay my landings in the Beechcraft Baron 58, and possibly other planes. I get crashes when using ATC to practice IFR flights.

When setting up a 3 NM or 10 NM landing approach flight configuration, the plane configuration is not setup correctly in the cockpit. The plane seems to fly but the switches are all in the wrong states. This is very annoying when practicing landings.

The ATC in X-Plane 12 is still terrible at best, MSFS 2020 ATC is by far much more enjoyable to use, maybe because the voices don't sound like they are from 1998. Although the MSFS 2020 ATC can still give terrible experiences so MSFS 2020 is not that much better, it still sounds nice to the ears.

The visualizations in X-Plane 12 have been improved but the rendering engine is slow compared to MSFS 2020 especially on AMD. The Zink plugin seems to work well to fix performance problems on AMD GPUs but they still exist.

Anti-aliasing is terrible. I render at 1440p and down scale to 1080p and the aliasing is still very bad although usable. This points to fundamental issues with how 3D rendering is taking place in X-Plane 12 and the developers don't seem to care which is a big shame.

MSFS 2020 scenery is much better, although X-Plane 12 scenery is still very good when compared to something like P3D, and switching between the two simulators only takes a few minutes to get adjusted to the different style.

X-Plane 12 clouds are better then X-Plane 11 but not as good as MSFS 2020.

You get more planes to fly out of the box in MSFS 2020 and hopefully MSFS 2024 *fingers crossed*.

I've decided to buy 3rd party aircraft for MSFS 2020 rather then for X-Plane 12 because I enjoy that experience more on average.

[u][b] PROS [/b][/u]

The X-Plane 12 user interface is easier to navigate and modify if you want to customize your flight simulator to suite your needs.

A few things in X-Plane 12 which came from X-Plane 11 are still more accurately simulated in X-Plane but that list is shrinking rather then growing.

[u][b] RECOMMENDATIONS [/b][/u]

One feature I'd like to see added is the ability to model ""wear & tear"" and ""persistent aircraft"" states. Hard landings should slowly increase the probability of a landing gear failure etc. I want to pretend that I own an aircraft and perform regular maintenance as well as fly across the US and land at different airports and not have to manage every individual flight myself. This should have been a feature out of the gate, since the implementation is simple and X-Plane already supports more accurate failure modes.

I want to replace steam gauges with glass cockpits whenever I want and really manage my aircraft and customize it as I see fit. I want to take it to the shop for repairs or performance modifications etc.

Implementing something like FSEconomy inside of the simulator would be really cool, looking forward to MSFS 2024 career modes and seeing if they fill that niche or not.

I have had this problem with previous versions of x plane but the only thing that fixes it is to uninstall and reinstall the game, and then only for a short time. Is there a cache somewhere that can be cleared every few days? Any ideas for how to fix this would be appreciated.

X-Plane admirably rose to the occasion. But with Microsoft back at the helm with Flight Simulator 2020, the recent X-Plane edition feels more like a distant echo than a true competitor.

Don't get me wrong, X-Plane 12 has its commendable aspects. The ATC radio communications, for instance, are better than those of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Conversations feel more real, more dynamic, making for an immersive in-flight experience. It's also worth noting the physics engine, a jewel of X-Plane. Flight dynamics feel realistic and challenging, presenting a substantial, and often appreciated, contrast to the sometimes overly forgiving nature of FS 2020. The rendering engine is top-notch: ambient occlusion, surface reflections, volumetric lighting and high polygon count.

However, these upgrades seem less like steps forward and more like minor alterations when compared with the competition. 

Guided exploration, an often overlooked yet highly immersive feature of FS 2020, is missing. This mechanic, which pushes pilots to interact with the environment in meaningful ways, is missed deeply in the somewhat static world of X-Plane 12.

Control mapping is one-dimensional. You can map any button to any aspect of the simulation, but a button can only perform one action. By contrast, FS 2020 allows you to map button combinations to actions. This simple tweak lets you control so many more things using the limited set of buttons available on something such as a gamepad. For example, in FS 2020, my directional pad (with no modifiers) is mapped to quick looking in a certain direction. However if I press the directional pad while holding the Y button, I can adjust my aileron and rudder trim. If I press the directional pad while holding the X button, I can control the various aircraft lights. This is such a useful and intuitive mechanic that is sorely missed in X-Plane.

The user interface and virtual cockpit experience in X-Plane 12 feels less intuitive and user-friendly. FS 2020 spoiled us with helpful tooltips for every single control in the cockpit, making it accessible to newcomers and still detailed enough for the veterans. X-Plane 12, unfortunately, falls short in this regard, making the learning curve unnecessarily steep.

Players who are highly compelled by world detail will certainly miss the jawdropping visuals offered via photogrammetry. This is the process of combining multiple layers of satellite imagery and data to synthesize the breathtaking world we experience in FS 2020. It would be unfair to place such an unrealistic feature request on the small team behind X-Plane, and credit where it is due, most important landmarks can be found in high detail when exploring the world of X-Plane 12, but without the photogrammetry, the environment just feels flat and generic by comparison. This would be forgivable if the terrain textures were a little more faithful to satellite imagery but this is not the case. Expect to see repetition and tiling in the terrain maps. Additionally, I have found that the terrain maps do not react enough to seasonal changes.

All in all, X-Plane 12 feels like a run-of-the-mill update rather than the leap forward we were hoping for. If you are in this for nothing but training in a sim, none of this probably matters to you, but if you also desire a fun / immersive experience you are better off playing FS 2020.",1686808575,1686808967,False,87,1,0.718393981456756592,1,True,False,False

The aircraft selection is amazing, aslong as you have the cash to buy more aircaft.

The replay system is also amazing but sometimes it carshes due to you not being patient enough so you try to go to the point you wanted to go to without waiting for everything to load in. Free aircraft like the ZIBO 737-800 by Skymatix are also so good and just payware quality, in my opinion better than the FBW A32NX for MSFS, the 777 by Stratosphere also looks very promising and I love how they allow you to try their beta versions.

In conclusion, there is nothing to not love about this sim also the amount of freeware and payware addons are overwhelming and mostly high quality, don't get me started on the CL650 by hot start that's just an incredible aircraft and feels like a different sim on its own.

I'm changing my review to ""thumbs up"" only because the game is stable-ish, as long as I'm gentle with it. If you avoid rapidly changing the plane's location/weather/camera, you will probably last a whole flight without the game crashing. It's a much smaller download than FS2020 and some of the negative reviews of that title makes X-plane 12 seem like a simpler, safer bet - at least for now.

Overall, it feels like this release is just a repackage of 11, with a few tweaks here and there.

Bought XPlane 12 on a whim just to see what it was like - I installed the highly regarded Zibo 737-800 mod right away (only plane I've flown so far) for a fair comparison.  I'm running the game on a machine with a 4080 / 12700k / 32GB RAM, Honeycomb yoke/throttle and VKB pedals.

-Let's get the obvious off the table right away - the visuals are nowhere near as good as MSFS.  XP12 auto-gen buildings are ugly, have odd placement (weird empty spaces and roads where they really shouldn't be) and the terrain/weather doesn't give that ""immersive"" feel you get from flying the MSFS skies.  The XP12 live weather likes to populate the sky with this weird polka dot/popcorn style of clouds that is just....odd.  You also won't be seeing many familiar landmarks...especially not your house or street.  (Edit 4/18/23:  With Simheaven and ortho, the latest enhancements to weather and lighting have the sim looking very good - if your PC can handle it.  Maybe not quite as detailed as MSFS, but somehow appearing a bit more natural to my eye).

-The flip side is that performance seems very good for XP12 - I'm always getting great frame rates compared to what I'm used to with live weather, traffic and a complex airliner at big airports in MSFS.  I also like the exterior plane models in XP12.  They have a more ""mechanical"" appearance to my eye (not just the Zibo, but other videos I've seen), particularly around the wing/flap mechanisms.  Most importantly, I think nighttime lighting looks hands down better in XP12.  (Edit 4/18/22: The above mentioned weather and lighting enhancements have made XP12 a bit heavier to run - stuck just below or above 30 FPS, which feels ""slow"" compared to MSFS with frame generation).

-Modding is much more manual than MSFS - unzipping files and storing them in some directory...and managing the script orders to avoid conflicts...no update notifications either.  This can become a part time job (and storage hog) if you're interested in trying to achieve parity with MSFS visuals by installing various mesh/ortho products.  But I did find some great mods - the aforementioned Zibo 737-800 is fantastic, ITC lighting helps to further enhance the already great night lighting (easy to go overboard so use a light hand) and SimHeaven X-America addresses many of the glaring issues with auto-gen placement and density.  Payware planes also seem to be generally more expensive in XP12, but there is a huge variety of quality products available.

-The XP12 user experience takes a pretty no-nonsense approach in getting from the main menu to sitting on the flight deck.  I appreciated how streamlined the experience was and how quickly I could start getting my flight ready.

-This is where I'm going to get some folks riled up.  I've long heard that XP12 really nails the flight model - and although the MSFS PMDG 737 had some visual/Ux differences from the Zibo, I didn't notice major differences in the way it handled.  All flight stages felt similar (except maybe ground handling a bit in favor of XP12) and achieved similar landings in both planes.  I'm no pilot in real life, just spent a lot of hours in sims so I'm willing to admit that maybe the nuances are lost on me.  My guess is it comes more down to your own peripherals, control response curves and the individual plane add-ons than the sim itself.

-Misc:  XP12 had some cool default camera views, the flight recorder is actually usable and the ATC seemed a little better than MSFS, but I use Pilot2ATC so no comment there.  Control mapping was also very easy to use compared to MSFS.  I use TrackIR and the head tracking seemed very ""floaty"" compared to what I'm used to as well.

That's all I've got - I'm not going to recommend or tell you to avoid it, just share my experience and let you decide.",1675208938,1681857511,True,84,2,0.870734095573425293,0,True,False,False

It requires one to actually study the aircraft manual (provided by X-Plane) to fly. Also due to lack of hand-holding like World Map, you cannot simply plan an IFR flight and jump in. You actually need a flight plan using some external tool unless you are ready to manually input all details into the FMS. Nevertheless, using LittleNavMap and XP 11/12 export, you can actually load the plans in game. 

FOR MSFS USERS:
---------------------------
So if you're from MSFS background particularly if you are a casual simmer, you'll find the going tough, even if you've flown before. The UI isn't as hand-holding as MSFS and you don't get the flying assists that are available in MSFS for a casual user. I've yet to fly a full IFR flight plan with ATC, because I haven't figured out how to get the in-game ATC to recognize the FMS flight plan (I know there is an option to file flight plan with ATC, but it doesn't accept your choice of departure or arrivals).

GRAPHICS
----------------
Regarding graphics, sure it is somewhat OK for 2023 and passable, and after seeing MSFS graphics it is likely to be highly disappointing. However, it is usable and you can actually get satellite imargery using Ortho4XP and world scenery using Simheaven. Ortho4XP can be very disk-expensive though. Be aware that Antialiasing has glitches at least on my AMD 6500 XT, with certain MSAA settings. It seems to work sometimes though. With all graphic settings maxed out (except MSAA) Getting reasonable good FPS around 25-30 (which is acceptable in a simulator) with 1080p on my system which is a AMD Ryzen 5 5500 processor, with 16 GB RAM and Radeon 6500 XT 4GB graphics. I am also getting the issue of blurry ground textures, which doesn't seem to be resolved at any quality setting.

CONTROLS
-----------------
If you are using a XBox controller or similar game controller as I am, and you are used to the default MSFS controls, you will need to calibrate and re-assign joystick controls. Which I did OK, but still certain functions could not be mapped (like throttle-cut-off).

MODDING
---------------
The X-Plane platform seems very moddable and almost as if it is a modders' paradise. With ability to download and easily use custom scenery for example. This is definitely a technology sandbox that tweakers will enjoy.

CONCLUSION
--------------------
I do recommend this, for those wanting to learn more in-depth into the aircraft systems experience, but for those who just want a no-fuss flying experience and enjoy the scenery MSFS is the better choice.",1679658771,1680244123,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I have had Microsoft Flight Sim basically since it was first launched and I have a lot of flight hours in that.  While MFS might LOOK more realistic, to me XP12 FEELS more realistic.  When I get on the runway in a plane, it really feels like Im there at that spot in real life, although I am definitely playing in a sim.  The way the world is mapped out in XP12, you can actually SEE waaaaay out into the distance rather clearly.  In MFS, distant details tend to be smudged and washed out the further away they get because of muddy looking texture filtering and whatnot along with overdone saturation.  The flight model in XP12 is fantastic and imho yes its MUCH better than whatever we have going on in MFS at the time I write this early review.  The planes feel and behave as realistically as you would expect, especially when you turn the flight model in the sim up to 10, which probably uses more power or requires stronger hardware.  The flight telemetry is another awesome feature I didn't know I needed!!!  Its so awesome being able to look back and see the entire flight path of where i came from.  This lighting is far and away better in this than MFS too I believe.For a few things that I do not like about XP12, the controls were kind of sloppy and a true mess to get set up with, but after some patience and careful remapping, I got it close enough to where I can fly comfortably, although with a hiccup or two that I still need to work on.  The visuals - they are great as far as making you feel like you're there lol but at the same time, they're not incredibly realistic and well let me be serious for a second here...  once this game gets proper regional meshes, this game will be an absolutely hardcore aid for learning how to truly fly.  Finally, the lack of multiplayer seems like a real bummer at this time, I really hope to fly around and share the same sky with other pilots easily in XP12 in the near future.TLDR:  Microsoft Flight Sim 2020 will get you going much faster, but XP12 is well worth the time setting up and experiencing the joy of actually being as close as possible to being up in the air and flying.  After I play this for more time, I will update this review as I see necessary.  XP is a bit more difficult for beginners, but if you're full of MFS and need something new, look no further.  I love both sims, if you can have both, definitely get both.EDIT:I am giving an overall negative review because even though this is out in full release now, it is NOT friendly with standard controllers.

I love the new light system, especially how it interacts with puddles / rain etc. Looks Awesome. 
The aircraft look fantastic, 
                     - Some shadow glitches, if you set ultra shadows i get very rough edges, so set to medium
                     - The light looks so good against the aircraft skins. 
                     - Interiors are great, but just shy of the cockpit quality found in msfs.

I love the feeling of operating the aircraft, on ground in the air. The ground physics and air physics are second to none. 
           - test the limits and you'll see that the aerodynamics model is legit good. 
           - i love the excellent feeling of innertia and weight, of which msfs2020 completely lacks. 
           
Also expect most necessary things to work such as ILS landings etc, unlike msfs where things are so jank. 


Got to say that the performance could be better, especially since i thought the VULKAN change was meant to improve performance. 
Also the gameworld can appear a bit rough, obviously msfs have  a much much better world , but its still nowhere near perfect - like msfs have some very arcadey elements. 


If you want to practice flying in a ""believable"" world then get xplane hands down.  
msfs is for kids and arcade xbots.

The graphics have a look that's a bit washed out in colour compared to MSFS 2020, and there are visual artefacts where interactions with fog and scenery occur that instantly break immersion. 

It's glitchy in other aspects too, mainly the AI that controls other A/C and the ATC system.

Finally, it may just be me that doesn't know how to work an airbus flight deck properly, but I experienced quite a bit of weirdness with not having control of throttles, even after disarming the auto throttle. Though I hear airbus a/c do like to filter the pilot's inputs, perhaps I had the a/c in the wrong mode. I've flown the MSFS2020 A320 with no issues though, so still suspecting some shenanigans need ironing out. 

The following is a blow by blow account of a flight from SKPE to SKBO (Pereira to Bogota) in the stock A330-300. I've flown as a passenger on this route, and wanted to recreate it. The game really seemed to struggle here, which is a shame as it had done a good job in Australia's South East coast, even away from the major cities, here, however, it completely fell apart.

 - Filed a flight plan through the comms page but X-plane failed to load it into the FMS, would be much nicer if there were an option to do this as an alternative to manually entering everything into the FMS (or maybe there's a way, but its not clear if there is).
 - Glitches in AI controlled NPC aircraft. Pileups happened, had to restart the flight, and make sure I got to taxiing before any other a/c did.
 - Other a/c seem to not know that I exist and taxi right through me, pushing in front in the queue. How rude! :P
 - A/c can pass right through you with no consequence, be far more entertaining if they collided with you.
 - ATC glitches part 0 - Tower directs me to taxi and hold short of active runway, but once holding short, never allows me to report this and move on, eventually just said ""bollocks to it"" and taxied into position. Tower tries twice to get me to go back before giving up and clearing me for takeoff.
 - ATC glitches part I - gives ridiculous approach vectors, e.g. being guided to 8000 ft above the airfield on short final
 - ATC glitches part II -  when I pass over the airfield at 8000 ft, Tower asks me to contact Ground, which I do, ground asks me to vacate the runway xD
 - ATC glitches part III - Yet more problems when I try to return to the tower freq to request a go around, can't change freq now.
 - ATC glitches part IV - When I try to change freq, told not to transmit when the channel's in use.
 - ATC glitches part V - After a few attempts to change to the tower freq (unsuccessful) eventually got trolled by the game saying that I've abused the ATC system and my services have been cancelled. 
 - Whilst trying to manoeuvre back to the final approach fix to try again, suddenly got an over speed warning. Which was weird cause the auto throttle had the thrust levers at idle, but engine instruments are showing 92% N2. Airspeed at nearly 300 Kts. I tried disconnecting auto throttle and manually cycling throttle levers, but this didn't change read out on the engine instruments.

Here's where I ended the flight, feels like ""turning it off and on"" might be the best way forward. 

My main bug bear with the game is how the immersion got broken. Most other aspects of the game are quite good though, so I think if this could be fixed, it would change my recommendation. For e.g. the sounds are good, the scenery is ok, obviously not as good as MSFS2020. The cockpit of the A330-300 is nicely done, the weather effects are good, the handling is, errrr, fine, I guess (wouldn't know, I don't regularly fly 'real' a/c).

There are also some really nice features like the in game map is amazing compared to that in MSFS2020, with VFR and IFR map overlays, and you can select nav aids/airports and other a/c to get more info on them. This is something MSFS could do with. Also though I griped about the flight plan not being loaded into the FMS I kind of like how Xp12 presents the flight plan maker view, its convenient and seems to select a viable route for you if you supply the departing and arriving airfields.


On the whole the game is decent, but let down by buggy AI. I'd likely recommend it if after a bit more tweaking they can make the AI more robust.

hope this helps",1679196686,1679196686,False,2,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Physics: 5/5, Even better than in X-Plane 11, have upgraded so much, weather is greatly simulated.

Scenery: 4/5, Still the same, sadly, no Ortho4Xp by default, however it is obvious because Laminar can't afford Google maps so they have default textures. They are much better than X-Plane 11's one though.

lag: 3/5 Genuinely, like always, X-Plane isn't FPS friendly and this is also proven to be a fact in X-Plane 12. While in X-Plane 11 it was much smoother, recent X-Plane 12 updates have improved it so soon it will be better performance wise than it's older brother.

Plane selection: 5/5, Even more planes than before, a huge selection.

Airport selection:5/5, All airports worldwide exist. Default airports have actually improved since X-Plane 11, which is a huge plus. Default support for jetways is also great to have.

Controls: 5/5, More keybinds have been released to fit with the default Airbus A330, other than that, everything has stayed the same. Great controls!

Price: 5/5 , I'd buy it for 100$...

Graphics: 5/5 , mainly the new features are 3D clouds, super realistic water, 3D trees and seasons, also windshield raindrops. Better shadows are also a thing now.



Other: Download time has improved by a lot, took me 2-3 hours, compared to X-Plane 11's 7 hours!



Rating: 5 / 5

Overall: Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better than X-Plane 11! The performance is currently worse but it's to be expected from a brand new release, the recent updates have made it very stable and I'm confident that soon it will perform better than X-Plane 11. Really, the only thing you'd need is Ortho4Xp to get satellite scenery, other than that, the game is complete, for me at least. I find it much better than MFS2020 now!

I played MSFS for about 2 years before I got X-Plane 12, and I can definitely say that the physics here are way more realistic than MSFS's even when it's set to the max realism. Failures are way better, especially with icing conditions. It threw me off the first time I was flying through a cloud and I started losing altitude and I didn't even know what was going on until I realized that it was due to icing conditions. I also love that you can click out the devices into it's own windows and move them around and the built-in integration with ForeFlight, it's awesome.

As a software developer, I've done a lot of stuff for MSFS, and still trying to understand how to use this game's SDK and it seems that the plugin framework is a bit of a hassle when trying to develop something. You have to keep reloading your game to reload your plugin vs. the way MSFS does it with SimVars you can read/write from your own external application without having to reload the game.

My only beef with this game is the ATC, it's so bad, and as a student pilot it's something I use a lot in MSFS to practice my radio calls by myself (no VatSim or anything like that) and doing my patterns and this game's is totally whacked. I have never been able to successfully do a simple pattern/touch-and-go using ATC, it just starts making me do all these random turns, climbs that make zero sense. Also, setting multi-monitors is a PITA, but at least after you ""get it"" you can set them fine, but it took me quite a while to understand how to, and the UI for it is a bit buggy, especially the bottom part of the settings for the side monitors.

Graphics wise, I feel like they are not as great as MSFS's and I wished the game had DLSS3 support like MSFS does, can't even get decent looking 30fps with an i7-13700K and an Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti when I can easily get 60fps in MSFS with Ultra settings. Plus, there are some small graphic glitches here and there, especially on the graphics shown on the side monitors, but nothing too bad that makes the game unplayable, just annoyances. 

To sum things up, it is a really good simulator, especially if you are a student pilot, you should definitely be practicing here instead of MSFS for more realism.",1677601116,1677601116,True,36,3,0.748169600963592529,0,True,False,False

do not buy unless you plan on buying the FlyJSim Q400XP or something similar.
if you are an experienced boomer simmer, i guess you don't care like me.
if you are new steer away and buy MSFS2020 for a better experience with the FenixSim A320 or PMDG 737 or the Freeware FlyByWire A320 and their upcoming A380.

I sim helicopters in VR, and XP+VR has always brought my system to it's knees.

There's no need to render the entire region if I'm only working in a 20 mi area at most.  Since I'm Los Angeles based, there are tons of objects that get rendered in places I'll never fly.

I'll just compare two even though people say you can't really compare two:

1) Actually hand-flying the aircraft XP12 > MSFS. It feels better, heavier, immersive let's say.
2) Landing physics XP12 > MSFS. Way MSFS handles touchdown, especially with addon planes doesn't please me personally. It's like as if gear is wooden and being slammed against the runway ( before you ask I CAN land fine ). In Xplane 12 you can see the hydraulics and that precision in contact.
3) Looks MSFS > XP12. I won't try and compare it this much, just imagine looking at a real car and a car that is supposed to be real but is made from LEGO. Blocky and stuff. XPlane is just not good looking. To add, at first I thought that ""hey, I'm getting more frames than in MSFS! ( I have Ryz5 + RTX 3070 ), but that was before I realized how bad things were looking in comparison.
4) Entertainment MSFS > XP12. I'll say this, XPlane is a REAL simulator to learn how to fly. MSFS is to fly around the planet and do some sightseeing. And until I bought XPlane 12 I didn't know what I wanted more from flight sim. Turns out I just need those 1-3 hours a day to look at cities of the world from 10000 feet and land smoothly. 
Unfortunately it took me 5 hours to understand all this and I'm unlikely getting a refund, but XPlane12 is gonna be put on a shelf of my Steam library for long time if not forever.",1675763304,1675763304,False,3,1,0.5249900221824646,0,True,False,False

And, here we are. After about 5 hours of gameplay, and after playing in my childhood almost any flight simulator, from the first Flight Simulator for Mac, to Fly! to X-Plane, I think I'm ready to give you my feedback on the latest and ""greatest"" Xplane so far. At first, is not a ""typo"" joking with Xplane and X-Plane.

It's just insane to think that Laminar Research in about 19 years was not able to give a ""DEFINITIVE"" name to its game: is it X-Plane or Xplane or whatever? They promote this as Xplane 12, but the website is X-Plane 12 and it is on Steam as well. This is a big fail, and we should not go on.

But I love to give a chance to this game. And when we get drop into the ""unnamed game"", and, maybe/perhaps, we already played with Flight Simulator 2020; well, here we get the biggest slap in the face we ever got. The sound quality has nothing to even compare with the poor quality we found in FS2020. But let's try to be honest we ourselves. A flight simulator game is our unique chance to see, to watch cities, and countries we have never ever been able to see.

Yes, is a simulation, rain on the windscreen, real meteo. But no, I cannot see a 3d model of the Golden Gate. Cannot see a toy like the London Tower. I cannot see a piece of crap as the Colosseo. No, dear friends in Laminar Research. You could have thought you made the best and most realistic flight simulator so far, but it's not true.

Completely! You have to decide or understand if you are making realistic games or professional sim experience. Cause a DLC, cannot cost as a brand new VW Polo. And even if you can find me drunk and buy a 5K USD DLC, I will never buy on a 3D fake city. This is a no-no. Xplane or X-Plane is not worth even its price. Not without a REAL scenery included, and DLCs priced as a gamer would expect.",1675113994,1675321559,False,2,0,0.477079778909683228,0,True,False,False

XP11 is quite stable, but needed to be upgraded for weather, graphics and overall it felt already older, especially when MSFS came out.

Now the bads: the base game mucht looks like the predecessor. 

Now the goods: the game is based on a stable build now, and it looks way better with the new clouds and weather and seasons in the game. You don't need to buy a lot of addons to make this looks even better. A lot of the stuff you want is freeware and most of the time still compatible from xp11 and even older versions.

Does it look as good as MSFS? No, but it handles way better and that's for me more important. While MSFS handles and has the UI of a game, this feels much more like a simulator.

VR clouds problematic (use clear skies), addon scenery scarce, environmental effects great (light, shadows, water). Flight model as expected (unsurpassed in the civilian domain). Will dominate, needs a few more iterations. Try, but do not uninstall XP11.

XP12 sucks in VR c RC1 (forced update). Help me to get B14 back on Steam and I go back to the review above.
Sucks means unusable in VR.

Looks like this to me: You tested it fine up to B14. No gripes. The eggheads decided to tweak the FBW, just change the control laws a tad. You do your standard stall tests, the thing drops a wing and you are inverted. Unfortunately, Steam XP12 does not have a spin recovery switch which gets you back to B14 in  no time. How do I go back, please comment.

OOPS, we are not talking about r1, as advertised in the steam GUI, it is r2 (see excerpt log.txt below)

Just get me back to B14, refund no option, already own several addons and I love XP12B14. Really

14.01.2023 Homodeck still not usable in VR. What is wrong? Why not doing it the P3D way, adjust your flight, activate VR later. Big and completely unnecessary dostraction. Reaffirm negative assessment if you are VR bound.

Almost every button works and it is compatible with any controller that is usb I think. I use the ATS ETS 2 sim panel for American truck simulator and i can program functions to it on X Plane. All of the planes are perfect to the detail and come with lots of different company liveries. I use the Saitek G Pro Flight Yoke on a mac. There are doubts about this game and the yoke working on a mac but this game and the yoke work flawlessly for me. There is also weather settings and you can create your own wind layers and cloud layers. There is summer/spring winter and fall. There is rain, snow, fog, and pretty much anything else you can think of. There is optional ATC as well and on windows you can use the website sim breif to create a flight plan. I have to manually put the information into the plane but that is also more realistic. You can ask for ils landings, visual landings, headings to nearby airports, visual takeoffs, and much more. the graphics are amazing and all five main continents (Australia Africa North America South America Europe) are available for download for free after you purchase the game. The only thing I would like fixed is that there is no world map so if you want to spawn into say Nebraska, you have to google airports in Nebraska because the only map is only available in flight and only shows the surrounding area.

The flight model has always been topnotch, but even there Laminar has managed to make further improvements since XP11.  For example water landings and takeoffs are now more realistic and challenging, and the real-time weather works better than it did in XP11 because minor turbulence is now taken into account and added.  There are new airplanes and more helicopters than before, and some models from XP11 have been visually overhauled.

+ XP12 have seasons
+ Roads are better in Winter
+ Some places looks better in XP12 (with addons I said) than MSFS

Cons
- Demand more work from user (sceneries)

- No A330 MCDU (and A330 is very buggy)
- Nuclear lighting during sunrise/sunset
- Cockpit lighting is still not right
- Cloud visuals are very inconsistent, still seeing giant walls of clouds in places, and other times awful looking clouds
- Live weather is broken, turbulence is completely exaggerated even in low winds (causes AP to disconnect and plane to go crazy) making many planes (included or payware) simply unflyable
- Engines constantly spool up and down during cruise when live weather is enabled.
- Inconsistent performance.

As I mentioned in the original review, right now I would not recommend this but am looking forward to future updates fixing the numerous issues when I will update this accordingly

Update for RC3: Still getting random framerate dips into the teens and CPU spikes to 100% for 30-40 seconds. Lighting and clouds still look pretty bad and live weather causes built in and 3rd party aircraft to sway side to side, turning live weather off resolves this.

I have 500 hours in XP11, and almost 3000 in MSFS. XP12 currently is very buggy even for early access and even unusable at times in the short few hours I've used it.

Many people may only have enough for one or the other and may ask themselves what the justification is for purchasing one over the other. This review is obviously my opinion and based on my experience having played both and, in fact, every X-Plane before 12. MSFS is the superior game in terms of aesthetics and visuals. In fact, I would argue it's better than most regular AAA games visually. If you only want to hop in a plane and take a VFR flight in a stunningly beautiful world with an unprecedented weather engine, then go for it. It also has a streamlined flight planning system out-of-box. But that's really where it ends for MSFS.


Where X-Plane is superior is everywhere else: the avionics; the flight model; ILS; the way the aircraft handle in general; the way ATC communicates with you; the sim’s overall performance and sense of smoothness. Whenever I played MSFS, I never truly felt like I was flying a plane. I just felt like I was playing a game. And this was especially aggravated by the frustratingly broken ILS system and ATC that doesn’t direct you realistically, issues that are still prevalent. The only way to get a somewhat realistic flight in MSFS is to purchase more meticulously researched pay-ware aircraft (i.e. PMDG) that pick up the slack where the developers failed and this can obviously be a point of contention for the buyer. With X-Plane, you get meticulously researched aircraft the moment you purchase the base product. Furthermore, if you’ve owned any previous iterations, all those aircraft will be available in 12. 


I say all that to say, if you’re a flight simmer who wants an authentic experience and a product that respects realism within the aviation world, then I strongly recommend X-Plane. If visuals aren’t the deal-breaker for you (X-Plane still looks great!) but, instead, you seek realism so you can actually learn how these aircraft and their comprehensive systems work, then X-Plane is what you are looking for.",1671487896,1671487955,True,201,11,0.88801807165145874,6,True,False,False

As a more or less long time flightsim user I am rather impressed by XP12 and especially their flightmodel which just feels great and right. (Some fixes with real weather are needed but will be sorted out in the coming weeks/months)

Since the start of the beta or early access, there were already 20 updates and the progress was really noticeable. FPS Improved by a lot, clouds look better and better with each update and much more.

So when you buy XP, you will get tons of updates for the upcoming years. Laminar Research is a relatively small company and compared to Microsoft, you can be nothing but impressed what this small team does.

Still, not everything is 100% perfect in this Sim. If you are a VFR Pilot or graphic/fps enthusiast, this might not be your thing, if you want a realistic flying experience that comes close to the real flight model, use XP.

The scenery and the airports are pretty on point although there is no streamed scenery (rumors say it might be implemented in the future)
Bugs might appear here and there as it is a product that needs constant development. 

The graphic is below the shine of MSFS but still overall very realistic and in some eco regions even better - I personally like the not too polished world of XP12.

Some peripherals I use: XBox Controller and TurtleBeach FlightStick. Better if you have rudder to, which I don't have yet.

But jumping here from MFS2020, I still learn something new still (that's the point. Learn).
+ Flying at night is better in some way than MFS2020.
+ You will follow proper rule for approach and flight. MFS2020 will just scoff at it.
+ I love that the G1000 (and others) PFD pops up, allowing you to learn device better.
+ Plane lights (beacon etc) is more visible.
+ Hovering on the button, you'll learn some good things too. MFS2020 didn't explain what pitot heat is.
+ In Asia where my region is, the houses looks like what I would expect in my neighbourhood. MFS2020 fail this.
+ The windshield damage looks realistic! MFS2020 always have this ""new plane"" look and no wear and tear.
+ There's some basic liveries for your plane too.

There are of course some improvement to be made:
- Rotary knob (for heading, OBS etc) will delay if you press longer.
- Sun movement will cause sudden light ""flicker"" from bright to darker.
- ATC causes crash if you just landed and request taxi to stand, and then quickly taxi to depart (while you're still in the runway)
- ATC sounds robotic, but its alright with me. Would be better if can be improved.
- No multi-button assigning. I'd prefer if 1 button can do 2 actions at same time (e.g., triggering both left and right rudder for brake).

It's a Beta, so keep that in mind before your purchase. But I'm happy with it.

With rc5 the overall performance has massively improved for me. Looks like they have done a lot of performance tweaking. I am having 30+fps most of the time and this is the traget FPS for XPlane since 11. My spec's are Ryzen 9 3900x Rtx 3070 32gb DDR4 RAM. From this point I can absolutely recommend XPlane 12, the flight model and feeling flying the different airplane's is just awesome.

I really don't know what they expect a PC to be like just to use it in a proper way. I know it isn't finished yet and not the final product but from what I have seen and done until today it's just ridiculous. Using 1080ti or Rxt 3070 with 32gb RAM an 12 core processor Ryzen 9 3900x and still facing bottlenecks and low fps performance issues isn't what I am looking for when it is about enjoying flying around in a sim. I won't spend all my money into a quantum computer used at NASA or CERN to make it hardly stable running with maybe 30 fps. I would change this review to a positiv review when there is a sign of balance between hardware utilization and usability but at this point stay away if you don't wanna end up going crazy by twerking changing drivers reading posts in forums and end up crying on the floor with below 20fps while trying to land any plane at any airport",1670418776,1671209123,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

In my opinion, X-Plane has been an excellent software for many years and to this day, in which the main emphasis is placed, first of all, on physics and aerodynamics.
Aircraft wings sway, wet and slippery runways directly affect the braking distance of the aircraft during landing, when passing through a cloud, the aircraft is subjected to turbulence, and much more.
As with the previous X-Plane series, for me, physics is the basis of a flight simulator, the goal of which is to bring the experience as close as possible to real flight conditions.
It's great that the developers of Laminar Research continue to develop the X-Plane, which is used both for flight training in flight schools and other institutions, in simulators, and for people who love the sky and aviation, like me.
Many compare X-Plane and MSFS, but I believe that these are two completely different flight simulators, each of which has its own soul.
The 12th X-Plane has a very well-developed graphic component with new trees, 3D clouds, weather conditions, seasons, etc.
I really like the lighting of the aircraft at night (navigation lights, taxi lights, landing lights), cloud shadows, as well as the real sounds of the A330, and the sounds of the environment at airports.
Since the product is just starting to develop, I'm sure there's more to come.
I wish the developers of X-Plane 12 from Laminar Research further development! Thank you 😀👍

// RUSSIAN //
На мой взгляд, X-Plane на протяжении многих лет и по сей день является отличным программным обеспечением, в котором основной упор сделан, прежде всего, на физику и аэродинамику.
Крылья самолётов раскачиваются, мокрая и скользкая ВПП напрямую влияет на тормозной путь самолёта при посадке, при проходе через облако самолёт подвергается турбулентности, и многое другое.
Как и в предыдущих сериях X-Plane, для меня физика является основой авиасимулятора, цель которого состоит в том, чтобы максимально приблизить опыт к реальным условиям полёта. 
Очень здорово, что разработчики Laminar Research продолжают развивать X-Plane, который используется как для лётной подготовки в лётных школах и других учреждениях, в тренажёрах, так и для людей, любящих небо и авиацию, как я.
Многие сравнивают X-Plane и MSFS, но я считаю, что это два совершенно разных авиасимулятора, каждый из которых имеет свою душу. 
В 12-м X-Plane очень хорошо проработана графическая составляющая с новыми деревьями, объёмными 3д облаками, погодными условиями, присутствуют сезоны и т.д. 
Мне очень нравится освещение самолёта в вечернее время (навигационные огни, рулёжные фары, посадочные фары), тени от облаков, а также реальные звуки А330, и звуки окружения в аэропортах.
Поскольку продукт только начинает развиваться, я уверен, что всё ещё впереди.
Разработчикам X-Plane 12 из Laminar Research желаю дальнейшего развития! Спасибо 😀👍

Of course they have the backing of a coporate giant, and a team ten times the size of Laminar's.  Oh, and not to mention Bing.  However, X-Plane has it where it counts, flight dynamics, X-Plane is a flight simulator first.  With that said, X-Plane 12's graphics are miles better than 11's.  The lighting is the best I've seen in a flight simulator, and the weather system is much improved.  Just need to work on them clouds.  As far as ortho, you'll have to add your own, and there are plenty of free options out there.

Now, those same fanbois will tell you that their sim is getting upgraded flight dynamics, but it still won't reach the level of realism of X-Plane, because...console.  They have to strike a balance between gameplay and realism to cater to the console crowd.  Laminar doesn't have this limitation.

DO NOT recommend the sim.  it needs A LOT of hours of work and last update (R1) dropped a lot of users FPS by 20-30fps.

THEY ARE NOT. x-plane.org also steal peoples private info and refuse to refund money for broken downloads. they are very rude and refuse to provide serial keys unless you send them your pictures and ID pictures, they dont even say why they just ban you and take your money.  x-plane has NOTHING to do with x-plane.org but because of .org they are getting a bad name.    this is Austins Game   LOVE x-plane 11 (minus the bad fps)

on a side note, yes X-Plane focused on flight physics BUT... MSFS came a loooong way, I will be switching because i need more immersion and flight physics from what i hear (real airbus pilot reviews) has improved dramatically.    FYI  look into MSFS and the Airbus addon from Fenix.   

I run a 3080 Nvidia.... Max settings 
X-Plane 11 --> 5-19fps (changing settings has little effect unless all on low) 5fps is when i land at night 

X-Plane 12 --> used to get 20-30  after the R1 update 5-17fps 

MSFS - dont know the fps yet but running all on max settings i get really smooth flight, no stutter or weirdness and have the full maps downloaded for max visuals (you can download them do they dont stream live while you fly)    

also MSFS you can get a demo for $1 from xbox/microsoft store and try it out, if you have a VPN you will have a hard time i had to fight for refund.  But you will also find MSFS online to try out if you look hard enough, thats what i did.  I am not requesting a refund from steam for x-plane 12 and moving to MSFS and buying the airbus made by Fenix as an addon.  Watch real airbus pilot reviews online.   not all MSFS planes have good flight physics.

Also I noticed someone said that the updates are delayed a lot on steam. They're not. Go to the betas tab in properties and select ""public beta"" I get them quite quickly.

Improvements:
1. The lighting engine is great and manages to look more natural than any other sim in my experience (haze looks especially good along with aircraft materials)
2. The weather engine has definitely become more realistic, and live weather works pretty well. Things like wind and thermals have been improved also.
3. The flight model has seen quite a bit of refinement (Austin Meyer wrote an article on it as well). Though 11's flight model was already quite good.
4. The clouds are volumetric and can look very good
5. The airport textures look a lot better now and along with the scenery gateway they're pretty accurate.
6. The water is now simulated with similar depth to the flight model, and colour is regional. The reflections on it look pretty nice as well.
7. The City textures and auto-gen have seen objective improvements over 11 despite what some say.
8. The ATC is more usable now, and has a very handy ""push to talk"" feature which allows you to use the menu without taking your hands off of your controls
9. The 3d trees are quite detailed
10. The seasons are neat, and snow will fall or melt if the atmospheric conditions are right (snow also works on ortho). Water will also evaporate.
11. There's 8 new aircraft which are surprisingly well modelled.
12. Sounds are better.

And it still retains nice things from 11 like the replay system, video/timelapse recorder, pretty easy modding, plane maker, a great and simple ui (especially for mapping controls), the instructor operating station, etc. Most scenery is backwards compatible and xplane 11 ortho still works, though ortho still uses the old water. Ortho4xp is working on an update. If you use ortho I would recommend installing simheavens X-world. Aircraft are steadily being updated. The aerobask robin and zibo 737 are also updated. Both are great freeware.

Issues:
1. It has the usual beta graphical/technical bugs.
2. Rural ground textures have not been changed at all and city ones could still use some work. I don't expect ortho (and I do believe you can have a very good looking world without it), but they should've done something. They have said they're working on it, but again, they should've done it before release.
3. Clouds are improving with most updates, but do look quite terrible sometimes.
4. Trees look meh when far away. Again, the devs are working on it, at least.
5. The fmc in the a330 is a placeholder, and the airbus one isn't done yet.
6. performance is also meh on my system.

Overall I love it, but msfs is better if you enjoy exploring new places a lot. Personally, I'm fine with installing freeware like ortho for the places I commonly fly until they have some better default solutions.

Having tried it myself, I completely agree that this was a worthwhile goal and appears to have been achieved in  wonderful fashion. I'm writing this review for a beta release, and the program [i]is[/i] in beta; there are occasional crashes, the graphics could use some optimization, and there are still hiccups being resolved. However, even as-is, it's a worthwhile investment for aviation enthusiasts, hobbyists, and anyone looking for finding out how an airplane, real or imagined, would actually behave in real (or odd) circumstances.

High Points
 - The expansive community of players and developers are already beginning to put out mods, custom aircraft, scenery packs, and the like. This will continue to grow as the system becomes better established
 - The fact that nearly every facet of the aircraft's design and operation are completely physics-based means that 
 - The graphics are smack-your-gob beautiful, though still a little buggy with the current release on an ATI graphics card. I have high hopes for continued development.
 - Weather conditions are much more configurable than in X-Plane 11
 - Excellent stock aircraft, improved over X-Plane 11 in both quality (with the new simulation systems) and variety
 - Lots of quality of life and realism improvements for ATC radio communication, especially in filing and amending flight plans

Points of Advisory
 - You will need a beefy graphics card to run at full settings, and you'll want a decent CPU for all the new systems
 - At the moment, not many custom or downloaded aircraft from previous version will work with -12, so there may be need for new purchases of DLC

As a real life PA-18 Piper Super Cub (non-professional) pilot I bought X-Plane 12 just because it has the PA-18 in it and I have to say the flightmodel (if you have the right rudder & stick hardware) is pretty much like the real thing (certainly not perfect but getting close)

So although the graphics are disappointing at the moment (especially in VR) and look pretty much the same as in X-Plane 11 to me, the flightmodelling seems to be much better than in FS2020 (tailwheel flying in FS2020 is nothing like the real thing: try to groundloop the Zlin Savage Cub or the X-Cub in FS2020...)

For me that means I practice landings, stalls etc. in X-Plane and fly cross country VFR routes in FS2020 as FS2020 is perfect for VFR flying. 

In short: FS2020 needs way better flightmodels while X-Plane 12 needs way better graphics. They should be mixed for the ideal Flightsimulator in my opinion...",1664964435,1664964724,True,60,4,0.860513687133789063,0,True,False,True

""Not a Number"" (NaN) render errors are displayed in bright magenta, which doesn't sound too bad, except that you either have no issues at all or your screen is nothing but pink seizure material. I am one of the unlucky ones who cannot play the game at all. 

There is NO fix to this yet, and someone connected to Laminar on the forums said that we are supposed to just close the sim and hang tight until they fix it. Also they don't know when it will be fixed, and have only just now started trying to address it. Charging $60 for a sim in this state, while downplaying how unfinished it is in the Early Access box, just reeks of desperation on Laminar's part. Of course they are aware of the giant that is MSFS looming over their heads.

Do yourself a favor and buy MSFS. It surpasses XP in just about every way. Its reputation of being less realistic and being a ""game"" while XP is a ""sim"" is an ignorant misconception spread by XP fanboys. Like another reviewer said, the harsh reality is XP's days are numbered as MSFS has far surpassed it in every realm. And XP fanboys cannot handle this reality because no longer can they claim their sim is the best and the sim for ""serious"" simmers. They cling so hard to this notion of XP being the ""serious"" simulator that if you call it a ""game"" on their forums or the XP website they will go out of their way to correct you. XP is a dying sim because Laminar clearly is not equipped to compete with Microsoft, and that is the harsh reality of the free market, MSFS is such a superior product that overnight it has made XP look like ancient software.

EDIT: From this point on I mainly focus on dispelling myths about MSFS spread by X-Plane fanboys. For some reason I focus on XP fanboys a lot in this second half, but that's mostly because they are spreading misinformation about MSFS and giving it an undeserved bad reputation among simmers who want a more realistic experience. I also elaborate on why XP is a dying sim, sad as that may be to see a long-running product like XP dying. The harsh reality is it cannot compete with MSFS, and it will fade into obscurity.

There are no specific use cases where XP outshines MSFS, none, no matter what the fanboys say. There is still this sentiment that MSFS is good for sightseeing and VFR while XP is where the ""serious"" simming and IFR flying is done. That is just plain ignorant and incorrect. It is baffling that people still believe such a thing, major self-convincing and cognitive dissonance takes place among dedicated XP users to justify their claims of it being the superior option over MSFS. It's comedic. I've seen the usual ""MSFS feels like an arcade game"" nonsense. But the best is when I saw someone said the PMDG 737 in MSFS feels like ""flying a Cessna"". Logic is out the window when it comes to these guys, absolute fanboyism. MSFS uses CFD flight modeling which is a more modern and advanced method, while XP uses Blade Element modeling which is more dated and uses data tables. MSFS has an OBJECTIVELY superior flight model, yet XP fanboys just plug their ears and still hang on to the claim of XP being the most realistic.

Instead of being thankful for MSFS' existence, providing us with the most advanced flight simulator to date, with 1:1 to the real world scenery. They drag it through the mud because it threatens the future of X-Plane. The devs of MSFS actively listen to and incorporate user feedback to improve the sim, and the ""serious"" simmers who play MSFS are positively influencing it. Taking advantage of MSFS' more advanced engine to request features far beyond anything XP can deliver. The last sim update added solar radiation modeling (heat, not the cancer-causing kind), something that no sim has ever had before. Just an example of the type of depth that MSFS is aiming to achieve. XP fanboys fail to realize that if they migrated to MSFS and participated in the forums, sharing their feedback, they will end up with a sim more advanced than their wildest dreams of what XP could achieve. MSFS has finally provided us a sim where it looks beautiful without hundreds of dollars of payware addons, without hundreds of gigabytes of scenery taking up space, we needed that for a long time. The only people who use XP over MSFS are frankly ignorant or drank the kool-aid the XP fanboys are serving. There are NO specific use cases that XP can be recommended for over MSFS, frankly there is nothing this sim offers that MSFS doesn't, there is no reason to play it over Microsoft's offering. 

Think your computer can't handle the graphics of MSFS? Wrong, I have a GTX 970 and an OC'd 4690k, 7 year old hardware, and the game runs perfectly for me with borderline maxed settings. Again, there are no valid use cases where XP can be recommended over MSFS, even with weak hardware MSFS will run better and look better. So with all that being said... go buy MSFS and never look back

And one more thing. I may be harsh on XP and make it sound like you have to be an idiot to play it, but honestly you can just play both at the same time. I bought XP12 for a reason intending to play it, and was so disappointed that it didn't work for me. Yeah, objectively it is worse than MSFS in every way, but sometimes it's nice to fly around in XP since it feels more ""experimental"" than MSFS.

First of all, holy hell! Does no one understand what an Early Access release means?! It means it's not done yet! Who do these tantrum-throwing infants think they are ""leaving <any game> forever because it looks like a throwback to 2010?"" Grrr!

If you're looking for eye-candy, you'll have to wait a bit longer. The lighting system and clouds have been updated, but the fancy new textures and auto-gen scenery is still being worked on. As a dabbling airport scenery editor, I've been a bit disappointed that I can't jump back in (lost interest after the final XP-11 scenery update was rolled into 11.55) and see whether my rural airports will benefit from a few details on the other side of the airport fence.

For the people complaining that MSFS looks better, um, duh! Microsoft launched mapping satellites into orbit and don't have to licence their own images! Of course their video game looks great. Give LR a chance to finalize their auto-gen scenery. (Then bitch and moan that you can't find your house from an FAA-certifiable simulator that mere mortals can afford.)

The lighting/weather systems and flight model overhauls are the real ""mostly done"" features at this point. The hard airport surfaces also look a lot better, and the runway markings are visible from the air now! (VFR and non-precision markings didn't do anything for runways in -11 and numbers in particular were small and hard to make out.) The old landscape textures even look a little better under the new light.

So far, the most noticeable difference has been the weather. Already, it's amazing for not trying to throw you into a spin when you leave a ""weather cell"" and encounter completely different air pressure, winds, temperature, etc. Even better, no more final approaches turned into sketchy go-arounds because the weather updated, and in the last 15 minutes the wind has reversed and the density altitude climbed 3000 ft.

The accurate, physics-based modeling has always been more important to me than being able to ""see my house."" (Although, even the old, OpenStreetMap data lets me ""see where my house is,"" which has been plenty.) I've never been especially unimpressed with the clouds (I don't fly in them,) and the new clouds seem about as good. The cloud improvement I'm enjoying the most is how the weather system puts them in plausible locations.

TLDR:
The simulation of flight is Laminar's main focus, and that is pretty much ready. They're working on eye candy, but it may not be ready until the full release. It probably won't be photo-real when it gets here, but then, Laminar isn't a mega-corp that can fund space hardware to take pretty pictures for it's ""flying game."" If you don't NEEEEEDD to be blinded by the awesomeness of graphics while you try to develop actual pilot skills, this is an excellent simulator. Just keep in mind that it's still in Early Access.",1664174069,1664542392,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True
2014780,123033286,76561198326960213,63,4,237,0,122,1672590204,"Eventhough its an alpha, xplane is almost perfect. It runs so incredible smooth! Yes, there's no photogrammetry scenery. But the scenery is definitly not as ugly as people are saying here in the reviews. If you don't like it, use Ortho4XP! I prefere a better flight experience over a few photogrammetry cities. If you want to see your house from above, use a real plane.
Don't get me wrong. If you want to fly around, do some missions and see nice landscapes, FS2020 is your sim. But if you are a real pilot or you want to become one or you have at least a few hours of flight experience, you will definitly appreciate xplane and you will know that there's no way around it. Yes, the flightmodel of FS2020 is pretty decent, but xplane's is still on another level. I simply love the micromovements of the aircrafts. That's what makes this sim so realistic. If you enjoy flying (civil) helicopters, xplane is the only way you can do it in a realistic way. With a little tweaking of the controls and the right hardware, it just feels like flying a real one.

There should be a discount. XP12 could easily come as an XP11 update, but I think Laminar Research is desperate seeing the current scenario in the market, and for good reason.

MSFS has raised the bar for graphics in flight simulation to a level that X-Plane will never reach. NEVER. That's because Laminar Research doesn't have resources, doesn't have enough devs and doesn't even have ambition to improve. Without even having ambition, XP12 and future versions of XP, if they exist, are doomed to have the same scenary of the late 2000s and that no longer holds up for a 2022 software.

Some people will mention physics and flight modeling to support XP12 against MSFS, using the narrative that MSFS has arcade physics or that MSFS is a game and XP is a simulator, in an attempt to make it look like the XP's physics are much better than MSFS's. This difference only exists in the minds of XP fanboys and people who haven't played MSFS recently. These narratives have already been debunked by several real-life pilots who even argue that the MSFS physics are better. And even though XP's are currently better, MSFS's aren't far behind. This big difference doesn't exist and MSFS physics is definitely not arcade.

MSFS has already evolved in two years more than XP has evolved in a decade and that is an indisputable fact. Keeping the current pace of evolution, in a few years, it will be very difficult to sustain this physics narrative. Anyone who wants to cover your eyes with them, is your right, but don't try to convince other people to do the same.

In short, I cannot recommend XP12 even for any specific audience. I can't even recommend XP12 to someone who owns PC that struggles to run MSFS, because XP12 performs worse than MSFS. X-Plane 12 is a simulator that has worse performance, much worse scenery and even questionable physics and flight modeling that is perhaps worse than its main competitor. MSFS already has the biggest share of the flight simulator market and if that's Laminar's answer to that, unfortunately it's asking MSFS to grab a big chunk of current XP's market share and practically have a monopoly for many, many years in the front, and monopoly is never good.

X-Plane can be considered a decaying simulator, losing users to its competitor and it will get even worse with MSFS improvements and new aircraft addons being released there. Soon, current XP third-party developers will have to seriously consider migrating to MSFS if they want to still exist, as the XP user base will no longer be sustainable for selling addons. iniBuilds is already gone. That's why I don't recommend buying addons for XP12 because it's a big chance to become abandonware in the future.
 
Without the domestic audience, X-Plane will return to its origins, being just a niche flight simulator or a professional tool for flying schools. XP's days as a domestic flight simulator are numbered and there's nothing Laminar Research can do to reverse that.",1663365095,1664058958,False,4,0,0.505389750003814697,0,True,False,True

- The new planes they added are extremely well modeled and detailed. Many systems and avionics are well simulated, and the planes themselves have very complete functionality. These new planes are very immersive and outclass many third party payware planes in other simulators.
- Downloads and updates are simple and done through Steam seamlessly
- Quite fast load times, and you can switch to different aircraft quickly
- Replay system works out of the box, and you don't have to manually start recording.
