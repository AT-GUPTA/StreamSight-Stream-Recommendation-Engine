Excellent game with so many options, you can play a completely different game each time.

Let me start by saying I don't play games to use my brain. I play to turn it off. I want a relaxing experience, with just enough to think about to not just be a repetitive grind. Therefore, despite putting in 100+ hours, I haven't even begun to see all the game has to offer. I doubt I ever will.

I turn off most of the antagonists. I set everything to easy. I start with a lighter to make fire. I turn resource growth up high. I have Buffalos galore cos I need their poo! There are still some challenges - it's not like playing Minecraft on easy, there's more to it than that, but it isn't hard. I don't die. 

Minecraft is probably the closest comparison but without the building element and with some cool things, like going insane from lack of sleep and murderous ents!

If you want to play the game with everything turned on, it actually becomes really difficult. You have to strategise resource production carefully and you absolutely will die at some point, or your awesome camp will burn to the ground, essentially leaving you to start again. 

The Co op is good fun. I found myself playing alongside the other player rather than actually working together much... but it's nice to have company.

Progression is developing your camp and survival skills. That is where it falls down a little for me - and I accept this is probably just because of the way I play - but it takes a LONG time to get your camp to a point you can start to design it in any way. Once you have started to set down roots, which you need to do to at least some extent immediately because you can't carry everything around with you, it becomes incredibly hard to move your stuff. 

What this does offer, is a chance to go camping to explore! I find my expeditions around the map, carrying just what I need, are one of the things that I sink the most time into. And it's always nice to get back home again afterwards! Though do beware, unless your settings are all super easy, you may come home to find your camp destroyed.

Honestly, if any of this sounds appealing, go for it. It's different, it's good fun, and chances are you can find a way to customise it to your liking.",1708856211,1708856211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike most other games similar to this, you are very limited to what you can do to the world around you. Building is a weird and unfun experience.

The combat is also not good. You click some buttons on your keyboard, then step back so the creatures don't damage you. That's called kiting. It feels very unsatisfying to fight creatures on this game, it barely ""feels"" like your attacks are doing anything to the enemies. It makes for bland boss battles as you just keep spamming the same thing until their hp drops to zero and they poof out of existence. They are more of an annoyance than a fun fight you look forward to.

It's boring. there's not much to do and you'll constantly find yourself glued to a wiki page to figure out what content you can explore here. I'd look for something else.",1708414559,1708414559,False,4,0,0.563436985015869141,0,True,True,False

It's how they keep you from realizing how bored you are--they make you angry! If you discover a way to manage a thing which is supposed to be threatening -like bees-forget it. Your world/server will be deleted. Don't buy it. They milk 1 good idea until it's not simply dead, it's resurrected, and sucking the life from you. If your computer is a fast one, then the animation moves fast enough that you can't really see that the antagonist isn't anywhere near you when it strikes. When your computer is slow, they paste over this by making your character glitch back and forth-while strangely none of the other animations are affected.

This game can be played solo, but Don't Starve is a better single-player game. The devs are still making updates for this game. The waterlogged update just came out. I have not tried it yet, but it looks fun. It looks like Don't Starve's Shipwrecked DLC. When you log in every day, you get a free item. Many things will kill you in this game, but give it a try.

Ah yes[b] Don't Starve Together[/b] the reason i haven't slept half of the time, it's pretty complex for a game as simple as rerolling every time you mess up. Now the main gameplay loop isint just that it consists of other gameplay element and stages of the game but im too lazy to actualy talk about theese so i'l go the fast route and just say why [b]I[/b] recomend the game.

It isin't much of a suprise that I like the game, i mean look at that hour count, so i'l start with...

[h2] The Good[/h2] aka. the ""YEEE""

The game's dificulty provides a challenge for both new and experienced players, and the fact you are forced to do certain things to survive realy pushes that theme. It also has roots deeply connected to Don't Starve and has too much lore to even talk about. Have I even mentioned the skins? Yup you heard me right, this game has cosmetics and skins so you can flex, I am going to point out an issue with them later tough. lastly to close this off, it has server side mods, so only the server host has to have the mods. yes this makes a diferance.

you knew this was comming and you should have predicted it
[h2] The Bad[/h2] aka. The ""WHYY""

Remember when I mentioned complaining about cosmetics? because there are limited edition ones! now dont get me wrong it feels great to have them but when youre a new player and you just missed egtting it... you are not going to be feeling the same. And remember when i talked about the dificulty? Yup if youre a new player there's a chance you will be looking for a tutorial. I'l be completley honest they had a good idea but managed to destroy it. another thing i have to talk about is hosting servers, it either runs perfectly or your server forgets what it is and just sais ""nah"" straight into your face, this is especialy true when you enable caves and mods... yeah the 2 of 4 pillars holding it [b]together[/b]. Lastly the main issue I have with this game is... well it gets boring pretty quick, like in the early game there isin't much hapening, like true it is imersive to a true survival situation, but spend a night in winter in this game, tell me is it realy that intresting?


[h2] THE CONCLUSION[/h2]

It pretty gud
The game has multiple ways of playing because of mods and modes ect. and the problems are kind of overshadowed by the good things. It's just good enough.  and let me know what you think, or if I made any mistakes in the comment section. just dont be rude or disrespect others!

This being said, it's thoroughly enjoyable with friends or alone. Though to note; playing with friends in other regions of the world there is a consistent issue with server delay and lag when performing actions. As an Australian playing with those in the United States, I find myself totally unable to combat enemies in game. There's something with the time it takes to swing at a monster, then attempt to kite their next attack, and the game's latency that makes it impossible to dodge. The actions happen before the animations, but mine occur late. I've heard that this is also an issue on the console version of the game, even when players are in the same region. On the same note, I am unable to enhance the speed of wood cutting and mining by spamming/holding the button, unlike my US mates. Something about the game feels slower when playing with them as opposed to when I am alone in my own server. Nevertheless, always a fun time. Just takes a while to get the hang of; particularly the strengths and weaknesses of each selectable character; though once you find your preference, it feels nice to get cosy with their unique abilities.

I've owned this game for a good number of years now and have come back to it roughly every 8 months after some friend asks to play it and every time I lose interest immediately. The grind is boring, the combat is awkward and it really just doesn't feel satisfying to progress. Most games which don't emphasise progression have some capacity for creative expression like decorative base building or something satisfying to look back on after, and it just feels like that's something which is completely absent in this game. It's not that there aren't notable progression milestones you cross throughout the game, it's just that getting there isn't an enjoyable process and the dopamine spike isn't worth the time. The game shines in it's aesthetic as well it's sanity mechanics, which are creative and undeniably unique to this game, but aren't enough to keep me interested.

Individually, the characteristics of being challenging and punishing while offering little guidance should and always be welcomed in any survival game, but not all three of them at this level of nuisance. The result of this mixture with awful execution is that unless you spent hours on tutorials, tips and guides on youtube or having a party member who knows exactly what to do and how to do it, you will have to start a new game over and over since the game is a ticking time bomb and if you fail to make enough progress at certain points, you and your current world is fucked. Of course I can not say for everyone but personally I prefer a survival experience that can accept and absorb my lack of knowledge about the game being a new player in exchange for short term penalties (which the majority of survival games are capable of) instead of forcing me to start over and over not even sure what I did wrong and how to improve from it. The way to ""gid gud"" in this game have little to do with player's mechanics but to solely watch hours and hours long tutorials which does not at all encourage me to continue playing.

I do not have any strong opinion about the art style and the music.

Playing solo is fine but it requires much more effort than playing with friends. the bosses are fun and have variety to fight. You have a ton of options of what you want to do like rushing bosses or going as late game as possible to where almost everything is automatic. You can also decorate but that's sort of hard to do without paying money or playing for years getting them passively.

Very Basic Survival Tips: There are the four seasons every year, and a year is 71 days (9 and a half real life hours). Your first is Autumn is typically a time for preparation where there aren't an seasonal threats. Winter starts on day 21 and lasts till day 36. You need items such as thermals stones or any clothing with high instigation such as the breezy vest. Spring lasts from day 36 all the way to day 56. Spring is the wettest season of the game and when it rains you have a wetness meter. The wetter you get the more sanity you lose. Finally its summer which is the most punishing season of all. If you don't have an ice flingomatic your base will catch on fire, and if your not quick enough to react you can lose everything.

Rest in peace, Klei, 2005-2020

I cannot make a better review than Indi-ana Jone, so i will put his here for those who stumble upon my review first.

""I should preface this by saying I loved Don't Starve. The core concept of this game is genuinely great and to play that core concept with your friends is a great time. The reason I can't recommend it is because of how the developers have been adding to the game since DST launched.

My main issue is that everything that's been added to the game since launch adds nothing to that core experience that was so great in DS. Survival is the name of the game, but everything (and I mean everything) added post-launch has essentially been optional content which poses no threat to the player unless they willingly indulge in it. Once you have a proper setup going, there are no more threats to you. The game doesn't have anything new to try on you once you make it a whole year, and whereas in DS you could always reset the world by leaving it and going to a new one, the only thing left for you in DST is the optional content. The surviving part once you get set up is stupid easy and the optional content is of noticeably lower quality than what's found in the base game. Again, the base game is great, but the devs have essentially just been adding useless bloat instead of building onto what makes the game great in the first place.

To grind my gears a bit further, the devs originally did intend to work on how the game scaled with players over the course of one's world expectancy with an update called Through the Ages. However, this idea was scrapped with what we're getting now (Return of Them) because according to Joew (Developer), the team had a discussion on what audience they wanted to appeal to during this change in direction. Essentially, they decided to reject the base of dedicated souls who were the original game's audience to instead appeal to the casual player, since they figure there's more of them and that means more people to buy those juicy cosmetics which are all the rage these days.

Not only has the new content not really added to the core experience of the game, they've also been doing kit reworks for a lot of the characters over time as well. However, the best way I could describe these reworks is simply, ""bloat"". Instead of doing tweaks and centralizing on a character's identity like the clamors for these character updates originally wanted, but instead adding a bunch of other mechanics and small things so that their kits ulitmately feel loosely cobbled together like a bad character mod. Not only that, but they do lore animations each time for the characters they rework, and god do they look genuinely terrible. Seriously, go look at the Woodie animation and then go look bad at the original DS trailer, its night and day, the art's taken a step in becoming an ugly clone of its former self.

On top of all that, the fourm has essentially become a hugbox for the development which is only accepting of positive feedback, which in my opinion is extremely lame. There's a lot of people who care about this game, the original audience, that they don't want to listen because in their eyes they cast their die a long time ago. I understand trying to reach out and connect with that casual audience, but I don't think you had to burn the bridge with the old audience to do so. Maybe a half and half instead of a 0 and 100 scenario, you know?

Some more knowledgeable people reading this might think I'm being hypocritical, since the caves are essentially akin to that optional experience I'm complaining that the devs focus on today. To counterargue, the caves are much more integrated into the base experience than anything new that Klei's been adding since DST's launch. You can access them from the start once you have a pickaxe and darting into the caves in many ways during the regular survival season is a smart move and it still feels like you're working within the main survival loop of Don't Starve while interacting with cave content.

Compare that, however, to the lunar island that's been added to the game in Return of Them. It takes a long while to get there, most threats are negated while being present there, and all the content that's there is some weird stuff you can do to get some juiced up tools. There's nothing much of interest there at all. Also, you could compare caves to just the addition of water in general; most threats in the game are entirely unequipped to handle some of the stupid things you can do with boats. For example, a character Winona can create automatic catapults which fire at enemies. They can be placed on boats, which has become the most effective way to kill bosses since most of them can't cross water at all. Ocean content is also very sparse, and houses the Malbatross and the Crab King, two of the worst bosses in the entire game, along with some more optional content which has you slave away at menial tasks not at all related to surviving in return for petty rewards.

But yeah, ignoring all that, the core gameplay which was made years ago still holds up today. A lot of people don't know how development has transpired and frankly won't care for the sobstory I just typed up, and that's fine. I bet my ass you'll love the core of what's being offered here if you've never seen it before, since regardless of what they do that core experience they've built their additional content onto is godly. However, if you reach the point where you realize you've survived what the game's thrown at you and are looking for more of it, Klei doesn't care about you at that point and you're never going to get anything other than some poorly-developed mods to feed into your interests.

I love this game, but I can't recommend it. The devs don't deserve your money until they straighten their act honestly, but if you just want to mindlessly play around every so often and buy all the cosmetics you can you'll probably have a blast.""",1637731328,1707098364,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

In any other PvE game, even when you play on servers, combat is smooth. But in this game, everything, and I mean everything is server sided. That means that it doesn't matter if an enemy is 30 meters away from you on your screen, if it hits you server sided, it hits you. I am not an expert in game development, but how does every single PvE game but this one manage to make it so that if an enemy doesn't hit you client sided, it doesn't hit you server sided (unless your ping is like 500+). Kiting patterns are the bread and butter of combat in DST but you genuinely have to rely on tanking if you play with friends on a server. Also, how does one manage to make it so that you have lag on your own server? Without installing a mod that fixes it you have literal input delay to your own server. Yes, you get used to it, but you shouldn't have to get used to it.

It doesn't matter how good your PC is. You can play on a Soylent opener and on a Nasa Super computer and still have the exact same problems and the exact same input delay.",1608428084,1706836231,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combination of light and dark, humor and horror in this game is wonderful.  I love catching butterflies and planting flowers just as much as trying to pick-axe statues in the ruins without alerting the clockwork bishops.

This is a game of preparation.  Be fed before you explore.  Bring a torch and a snack.  Accumulate enough minor items to fight mini-bosses for medium items.   Then bigger bosses for the best items.  All the while, exploring the world and slowly turning your little corner of a hostile environment into a relative Garden of Eden.

This is a hard game.  Until the skill trees, there was no leveling up your character.  You'd pretty much end up the same flawed weakling as you started, just with better equipment and bundling wraps full of health and sanity food.  Even with the skill trees, that's true, just with a few good tricks up your sleeve.

I love running in circles until one hard mob aggros on another.  I think this is so much cooler than turning into a superhero and killing everything yourself.

The bosses are well balanced for 3-6 players (depending on the boss).  After around 1,500 hours I started soloing Bee Queen as various characters, but I still usually have to roll back several times in that fight.  Consider the Automatic Health Adjust plugin for single-player unless you want to practice the fight for so many hours that you could have become a violinist instead.  Some characters have an easier time than others.  I guess I'm a Walter main, so YMMV.  At 1,800 hours, I've never fought Fuelweaver or Crab King, but I have cooked every dish in the crock pot, grown every crop to giant, completed Pearl's labors, and caught every fish in the sea.  My play style is much more about survival than fighting.

I'd say this is ""the next Nethack"" but it's not turn-based.  Don't Starve Together is so different from the original Don't Starve, yet looks very similar.  Skill at one doesn't entirely translate to the other.  Once I found the wiki pages for Food, Crock Pot, and Farm Plant, and some handy plugins, I was very happy.  Strongly suggested plugins:

* Insight - makes the invisible visible
* Global Positions - share the map with your friends, or with yourself in Wilderness mode.
* ActionQueue RB2 (RWYS supported) - save your tendons
* Craft Pot - avoid wet goop and monster lasagna
* Minimap HUD - see the map while you play
* Combined Status - see your temperature
* Simple Health Bar DST - or any other health-bar mod.
* Pick-up filters - don't pick flowers automatically
* Skins extender  - auto-open your ""gifts"" so it doesn't interrupt your game.

I wonder why the game doesn't include these features.

I sometimes ""rollback"" my server when playing solo.  It's much easier to recover from the last good day than from the last bad mistake.  Actually, groups of friends rollback their servers sometimes, but I never really settled into a group.

If I were to redo this game, I'd probably make intact ecosystems give you sanity and other bonuses and have destruction cause you to lose it.  Then I'd make going insane more deadly.  I'm not sure what I'd do then to still make it fun, but I wish that there was less benefit to killing, destroying and burning and more benefit to growing and restoring.

In short, I needed an escape from the world for a year during my divorce and some health issues and this game provided it much more than any other game.  I spent about 20% of my ""play time"" updating the wiki instead of playing the game.",1675207228,1706807564,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I like seeing my friends die
Someone might say that some kind of horror game would be better for that, but nuh uh im the first one who dies in that case, it wont work. I had a best time of my life playing with my group. The game is punishing, but no one's will be offended/annoyed by that. You will have a ton of lil goofy situations, memories, you will have fun
Or or or maybe your friends are not as autistic as mine, maybe you prefer a slow game, making a garden gathering with your HELPFUL friends and listening to this gorgeous soundtrack while just bullying deerclops. And thats fine too!! No matter how you play it game aint stopping being the best thing. (uhm, will be appreciated if you really have friends like that, make them dm me, i want to play this game good for ONCE. And that an awesome part about the game too. I have found so much cool people around there, i've made new good friends. AND it'll be insanely good if you, yes you, and i played together)
I could tell you how much i adore the design choices, music, characters, their powers and abilities (KLEI you NEED to protect your creative command no MATTER what) but im sure you'll find all of this if you scroll a little bit because, oh boy, im sure fans are appreciating this so VERY much.

Unlike most other games in this genre, it's not a resource grind--in fact, it requires you to spend your time efficiently and to think ahead to survive.  Survival actually always feels like a threat if you ever stop thinking.  In that sense, can be like a psychological war of attrition (which I love).

Also, I love the atmosphere and the characters: dark, yet whimsical; each demanding a change in your play style as you learn to work with their strengths and weaknesses.

Gets lots of developer love (somewhat to the exclusion of its single-player older brother), even including support for multiplayer using community-created mods and finding other players.

There are a couple of mods I need to use to make this playable (removing some sounds and visual effects & reverting the crafting menu system).

I've been playing Don't Starve Together since it's release in 2016, and it's been a joy to watch it continue to grow and evolve throughout the years. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and there are so many things you can do in it. You can fight vicious creatures for powerful items, create cozy farms, and enjoy simply surviving in the Constant. If you ever get bored, you can use the world customization settings, console commands, and mods to create unique challenges and experiences for yourself. Just last week I had the idea to create an ""Escape from the Moon Quay Island"" challenge for myself that was really fun and got me to reconsider the resources available on the island. I've only just recently beat what are considered the final bosses in the game last month, and had a blast doing so. 

The one major downside to this game is unfortunately the multiplayer aspect. I've had to stop playing on all of the public servers for my own mental health due to multiple distressing events that I've experienced over the years, and this past October was apparently my breaking point. Even just looking at the list of servers is stressful now... It sucks, as I do want to have fun with other players. If anyone knows of any safe servers, please let me know in the comments.

I would recommend Don't Starve Together for anyone that enjoys a bit of challenge and enjoys survival games. I'd also recommend to avoid relying on the wiki in the beginning, as it is immensely satisfying to figure things out on your own. I still fondly remember the first time I played Don't Starve, finding a red mushroom and thinking ""It's dangerous to eat random mushrooms in real life, that probably applies here too."" I was right!

It stagnates after a certain point and each subsequent update only really keeps you on the hook long enough for the next update to drop.
A lot of their recent decisions aren't geared in a way to maximize fun.
Many of the exploits and bugs are used in the game to make up for where it falls short, and when such bugs are discovered, they're patched, not even addressing the problem which makes exploits or bugs enticing to use.

For example caves. In it's nature, it's a hard place to traverse, but because of it's sporadic layout compared to singleplayer, it becomes tedious to maneuver around them and it really just becomes a safe haven against the season of summer.

To even make caves tolerable, one must exploit them to eliminate general tedium.

Also the decisions made with individual characters, for example, the most powerful characters before their rounds of buffs already stood at the pinnacle at the game, however, klei decides to give them more tools to make them more powerful.

Think about this, a character who can make plants grow at will, summon lightning, and is the most capable character to craft items without huge commitment also receives additional abilities to make it rain, which a precedent was set in single player for all characters to do this, summon the full moon which eliminates darkness and summons a school of fish, which completely renders the fishing minigame obsolete.

I could go on with the flaws and might even write an edit, but this game is currently in a live service hell with a misguided direction. Never pay full price for this game and never buy skin sets the day they come out.

The artstyle is so creatively unique it instantly stands out from the crowd, each character has its own survival quirk like for example; somthing simple like a guy who can grow a beard in winter to help keep warm or a guy with an unbreakable axe talking axe that if he doesn't keep chopping wood he'll go insane and turn into a giant wood eating beaver... Yup

Playing with friends makes this game 10 times more enjoyable, managing a camp together until a huge ass monster badger comes looking for food and all hell breaks loose.

However, it's not a game for everyone, as it has its fair share of frustrating moments. When I first bought the game years ago, I quit after playing for 2 hours, and only recently just picked it back up to give it another shot.

One of the biggest downsides of the game is the lack of tutorials, which can make it very daunting for newcomers. You're thrown into the game without any guidance, and it's up to you to figure out how to survive. Some events like the first Deerclops attack or random summer wildfires can destroy everything you've worked hard for, and without any prior knowledge on how to avoid, it can feel disheartening.

DST is heavily reliant on the wiki. Players need to alt+tab frequently to look up information about items or how to progress, which disrupts the immersion of the game. Once you get the hang of the game however, it becomes a bit more enjoyable. You start to understand the mechanics and develop strategies to survive.

DST has several quality-of-life mods that can greatly improve the experience. Combined status, Geometric placements, Insight (item info display), and extra equip slots are just some examples out of the many. Would not recommend without at least some mods.",1678521362,1705428297,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Try playing with mods, you insane person! There is a whole workshop filled with mods to make your experience much more difficult. For instance, ""Uncompromissing mode"" is one I just thought of.

The hardest thing for new players are the bosses that come with each season- I honestly would turn them all off if you intend to learn this game. I additionally recommend turning Autumn (The most chill season) to very long to give yourself good warning and ability to prepare for the seasons or side objectives you want - like gardening with a gardeneer hat to learn all plants by name for future runs. Or taming a beefalo by riding it and giving it only enough twigs to ride and tame - so you don't waste resources (look up a video)

Graphics could make the picky ones turn up their noses, but believe it or not in the long run, not tired and is very cool. The exploration within the game is infinite being the huge map leaving out the various caves and biomes within it. One of the main points of this game are the monsters, it is possible to meet any unimaginable creature from giants to mutant monsters. The gameplay presents a huge variety of possible crafts that can allow you to build huge and creative bases, in addition to this you will also find several protagonists with skills that will allow you to vary your experience, the fights are quite simple as soon as you get carried away, they are quite schematic, that is, they attack themselves and expect the enemy to do the same repeating it until it dies, so it might seem boring but the atmosphere and the monsters you meet will not disappoint you in expectations. Survival within the game is really tough in almost all biomes, especially during the winter and summer, not to mention when it rains.

you can put lots of hours into this game; it has tons of replayability and you'll definitely get your money worth for the infinite hours of playtime you can get from it. there's always something new to learn and discover as the in-game days and seasons pass, so it's unlikely that you'll get bored anytime soon.

different to the normal DS, DST has fun reskins and clothing items you can unlock, which just adds to the list of things for me to do in this game, which i like. you also get rewarded with these things by simply playing the game, or even just logging into the game daily.

the game gets updated regularly so if you thought you were done... well here's something new to do! after all this time klei still update the game and listen to community feedback. they're such an awesome team and i'd totally recommend checking out their other games as well.",1564488060,1704854394,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you like a sandbox survival game with a little more challenge than stuff like minecraft, this is the game for you. It has your basic mechanics like health, hunger, enemies, but then theres a literal sanity stat which makes you hallucinate monsters that will fight you unless you manage it. You can do so much stuff in this game. Want to just chill and survive? You can do that. Want to explore interesting land, ocean, islands, caves, and more? You can do that. Want to bring a friend? It's called Dont Starve Together for a reason. Want to watch OrangE youtube videos about dst lore over and over while you wait for him to post a new video? You can do that. Want to pin bosses against each other? You can do that. Want a final boss? Theres literally 2 and more content after that. There is so much personality and passion in this game. I mean Klei makes an entire character short per update. Yes this game is still getting updates. It's awesome. Here is a pros and cons list so this looks like a professional review:

Pros:
1. Good Character Variety. You can choose whoever you want each with their own ups and downs (except wx-78 hes my main hands off).
2. Good Enemies And Bosses. The enemies in this game are unique and interesting with their own attack patterns and varieties.
3. Crossover with terraria. If terraria did a crossover with it you know the games good
4. The progression. There is a lot of progression in this game, but it doesn't force you at all. The future updates add things in a way that doesn't punish any players not keeping up with it, instead giving more progressed players more challenges and rewards
5. The mods. I have never seen a game with modding as easy as this. Forget Tmodloader for terraria, this is the way to do it. All you do is hit the get mods button, choose to subscribe to the ones you want (completely free btw), and then you can enable them before launching a server.
6. artstyle. its good, im not an artist but i like it.

cons:
1. very harsh for beginners. ok i get it if you say this game is tough for beginners, but when it says an ""UNCOMPROMISING SURVIVAL game full of science and magic,"" you should know what your getting into
2. Soundtrack. It's pretty bare bones. I don't enjoy it very much, but the simplicity matches the games tone. You dont want spiderdance from undertale type music blasting while your picking flowers and berries
3. Walter telling stories on the campfire. dont trust the sanity meter going up youre real life sanity will plummet
4. The rollbacking feature. I get its to avoid griefing but its just too easy to die and then push a button to have no consequences. Yes there are reviving methods in game and even modes that allow instant revives but if theres a button to go back before the fire hound burns my base and kills glommer, im gonna abuse it :(.


In summary, there is a reason my profile picture is chester.

There are tons of mods to customize your experience- some even supported by klei themselves- and even in vanilla DST no two games will ever be the same. 
Whether you're playing with friends, random people, or yourself, DST still proves to be a challenge especially for new players. The community itself is so welcoming however, and- true to the title- together you can learn how to survive and uncover many of the games bosses and secrets. 

Even if you're a ""cozy gamer"" please give DST a try. There are plenty of options to give yourself an easier more relaxed experience. You'll find that the overall artistic charm of the game coupled with all the different playable characters makes it all worthwhile.

From basic mechanics of health, hunger and sanity to day-and-night cycles, such simple systems weave together an intricate, delicate balance between life and death for your characters. Despite the game's title, starving is, in fact, the very least of your worries. The torrent of hostile mobs being in the game was so alarming that it struck a deep hesitancy in myself when approaching any mob the first time, even the adorable Glommer which I shamefully admit. 
Combat in this game is also wonderful. While I initially thought that combat would either be simply tanking, with lots of health restoring items, or dodging with a push of a button, this 2D game only requires you to move out of the way. Yet, this allows for greater mastery as you would not only need to time your movements, but calculate the distance moved by your character to maximise the number of hits on your desired target.

its understandable that not every player wants their hand held as they learn about the game - but this game has little to no direction and you can honestly spend hours and hours on this game (i have 8.4 hours) and i still have no idea what tf is going on - it very much seems like a game you have to spend a long time wiki'ing things up and getting help externally rather than learning as you play

- 1st time playing, dont know what to do, dont know what to get. Need wiki open everytime i need to find out something. And the hunger and sanity is brutal. i survive for a week on average and proceed to have no food or no way to increase sanity then die.
- dead is really annoying, you need to be mindful of your hunger, health, sanity. then you died and you need to find a stone altar. (1 time use) need to set to relaxed world beforehand if you want so revive at gate. But still tedious if hungry, 0 sanity, 0 health (perhaps because i need to hunt cause theres no food, i'll get to that later). You need to go back and forth if you die.
- food is rng. sometimes a lot come and sometimes you need to hunt which doesnt go well usually (death)
- Again need wiki a lot. saw a farm, thought i need a hoe to plow the land, cant plow the land, need another item. So many wasted resource finding out what this do and what that do
- ok my 10th playthrough, i got this, i know what to build, what to do, iam ready. Proceed to get world with rare flints, sometimes food, sometimes grass, sometimes gold nugget and stone.

This being the multiplayer version doesn't discount the fact you can still go in solo if you want, but I do think friends on other characters drastically helps balance out your own weaknesses.

Don't Starve Together is an addictive blend of survival, exploration, and social mayhem. Its charming visuals, deep mechanics, and endless replayability make it a perfect storm of frustration and fun, best enjoyed with a group of friends willing to laugh (and maybe cry) together as you navigate the madness of this quirky wilderness. Just remember, teamwork makes the dream work (sometimes), and duct tape is your best friend when things get hairy (metaphorically, of course).

-={ GAMEPLAY }=-
Shared survival, double the fun: Work together (or maybe against each other) to gather resources, build fortresses, and explore the ever-changing world.
Diverse playable characters: Choose from quirky personalities with unique traits and playstyles, adding even more chaos and strategy to the mix.
Hilariously brutal world: From shadow monsters to exploding turkeys, the game revels in its dark humor and unforgiving nature.
Constant updates and expansions: New worlds, characters, and challenges keep the experience fresh and exciting for years to come.

Steep learning curve: Mastering survival mechanics and navigating the unforgiving world takes time and practice.
Random can be brutal: Unforeseen events and harsh winters can easily wipe out unprepared players.
Griefing can sting: Be wary of mischievous friends who might turn your co-op adventure into a chaotic prank fest.

Don’t Starve Together is a fun and challenging survival game that you can play with your friends or strangers online. You can explore a vast and varied world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. You can craft items and structures to suit your survival style, and cooperate or compete with other players. You can also unravel the mysteries of the Constant, a mysterious land ruled by a new shadow queen.

The game is constantly updated with new content and features, such as new biomes, mobs, recipes, and craftables. The game also has a vibrant and helpful community that creates mods, guides, and fan art. If you are looking for some good tutorials, I recommend these YouTube videos:

[/list]

Some tips for beginners are:

[list] 
[*] Don’t starve! Always keep an eye on your hunger meter and eat food that restores both hunger and health. Cooked food is better than raw food, and crockpot recipes are better than cooked food. You can find some crockpot recipes here. 
[*] Don’t go insane! Your sanity meter will drop if you are in the dark, near monsters, or near certain objects. To restore sanity, you can wear certain hats, eat certain foods, or pick flowers. You can also use a tent or a siesta lean-to to sleep and regain sanity, but they will cost hunger and time. 
[*] Don’t be afraid to die! Death is inevitable in this game, but it is not the end. You can respawn at a touch stone, a life giving amulet, or a meat effigy. You can also be revived by another player with a telltale heart. However, each time you die, you will lose some maximum health, which can be restored with a booster shot. 
[*] Don’t be alone! Playing with other players can make the game easier and more enjoyable. You can share resources, help each other, and learn from each other. You can also play different characters that have different abilities and perks, and complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

It is an interesting and fun game, and as a fan of the original game, I was super hyped for the co-op release. But this version has a giant flaw of not having enough respawn capabilities, which at times just feels horrible. The fact of how 'expensive' respawning a teammate is, and how fragile your lives are by design, really is a very poor combination for an enjoyable co-op experience.

As it stands, the fact of how easily you could lose everything was, in a sense, a heart-throbbing game mechanic which is more exciting when playing by yourself. But when you are playing with somebody else, and either one of you ends up dying early on, it becomes a time-consuming chore to invest all of your time and resources to simply let your partner be able to play with you again.

A simpler, cheaper respawn item would make a huge difference. Perhaps a voodoo doll or a simple Minecraft-esc bed would help so much in making the co-op experience, basically the reason you would buy this version, worth the trouble. 

This game is really hard to get into for casual players, and unless you really enjoyed the gameplay of the original Don't Starve games, you are not gonna enjoy the entire aspect of the multiplayer aspect, as people tend to brush it off after the first few failed worlds.",1620273049,1703147538,False,1,0,0.38279077410697937,0,True,False,False

You need to know what you're supposed to do via player-made guides before you even start, and, after that, you'll just... Do that. In an archaic engine. Forever. There's no endgame, or ""game"" even. It's really more of a simulator with skins.

Characters are... Well, they exist. Keeping the simulator thought in mind, they're just different people to experience this game as. That's it. They have different playstyles if you learn what those playstyles are beforehand, but even then, they're not concrete and can just be... Worthless traits. Like Wurt or Winowa. 

Then there's the skins and drops. Yep. In a simulation game. They're boring, but sellable on the steam market for pennies, so... I guess enjoy that if you want...?

In conclusion, this isn't a game. It's a bad survival simulator. Go play something like Raft or The Forest if you actually want a good survival game with objectives and meaning.

The game itself is fun, especially with friends. Theres regular updates by the devs and if you think it lacks features you can also use mods to add the singleplayer Dont Starve features such as shipwrecked and more into DST.

This game doesn't just ask you to survive, but provides a unique experience full of mysteries, dangers and exciting adventures.

One of the game's greatest assets is its unpredictability. Each new launch is an exciting journey into an unknown world filled with strange creatures, mysterious artifacts and desperately needed resources. You will constantly find your way through dark forests, explore caves and fight for survival in conditions that change according to the whims of chance.

The graphics and style of the game are amazing. The unique dark art design creates a unique atmosphere that gives the project a recognizable character. There's something new and surprising around every corner that keeps you interested even after hours of play.

However, Don't Starve Together's real strength comes in its multiplayer mode. The ability to survive with friends adds a whole new level of fun and challenge to the game. Teamwork and strategy become the key to success, with each player bringing their own unique skills and ideas to the table.

Despite the challenges it faces, Don't Starve Together creates a surprisingly rich and captivating world that forces you to believe in yourself and explore new horizons of survival.

I always enjoyed it, and have over 1000 hours, and met lots of friends through it, so I could never say 'no'. Yet buying it for a number of friends from other places always had the same outcome - they'd ragequit and never come back. Given how long the cycles take in this game, there's no way anyone would be able to get their money back on steam once they learned they don't like it. So I could never say 'yes'.

It had quite a special place. Always utterly destroying the player for making mistakes they didn't know they were making. Truly feeling like you'd be exploring a new wilderness. And eventually, you'd conquer it. Every down side had an up side. Monsters that would attacked you dropped resources, that used properly could benefit you.

But recently the game's been morphing in to something... different.

It's not even really the same game.

It started with ""farming"", fishing, and boats which was fine. There was no real 'crippling down side' to it. But I guess they wanted to make it more noob-friendly in a way?

But then they started adding stuff from other games in what feels like a desperation to fit on or be recommended. 

Progress trackers, levelling, and annoying sound effects. Things that never belonged.

It Felt like a genre-creator. Now it just feels like an over-stimulating mess.

TL;DR 
tedious. unclear/unintuitive progression. wiki perma-open. difficulty is a do-not-do list

for clarity: i didn't get far into the game, but i did try for 30 hrs (many runs, on many different days). im not typically bad at games, but i was slow in how i played this game, and runs died often. im also of the opinion that it shouldnt take 30 episodes for a show to become good. this also applies to video games. 30 hrs is plenty.

the game is difficult, but its not a difficulty that makes you feel like there's a challenge to overcome (at least not for the first 30 hrs!). you just die for some reason and have to restart. the difficulty honestly is trying not to do things that have any risk (which is where any fun is imo), so then the game difficulty becomes a list of things youre not allowed to do, which is fitting for the game title

i dont feel any reason to progress through the game. no clear objectives, no intriguing items/places/enemies, no in-game guides, i didnt see anything. there's some crafting involved, but i dont even know what to craft or how to craft or even what progression is unless my friend is holding my hand through it. is that the fault of the game? or is it my fault for not seeing/exploring/understanding enough? i dont even know. can you blame ignorance? 
i personally dont find it fun to have a wiki perma-open in another tab for me to find out what to do next. or to need a friend to tell me how to play CONSTANTLY. it's possible to find out what to do without the help, but it's not intuitive at all. i was just crafting random sh*t until random sh*t happened, unless, of course, i was told what to craft. again, is this my fault or the games fault i dont know. so again, can you blame ignorance?

genuinely the only time i was having fun was when i was just running around exploring, trying to find some challenge to overcome. but then it turns night, which is no-fun-allowed time. but there wasn't even that much to explore anyways. not that every game needs to have all kinds of shit to explore every which way you go, but any time i explored i found maybe 1 semi noteworthy thing- ""holy crap, another statue!!!!"" i was mostly just hitting rocks and picking up sticks and grass...
thinking back on it, i often turned getting-back-home-in-time into the most fun i'd have, which is often when i'd die.

the (common) enemies just feel like common obstacles, and the combat is basic, but you shouldn't even try to fight enemies (just another item on the do-not-do list), so whatever...

i guess im the outlier. i generally love these kinds of games (terraria and factorio are a couple all-time favs), but i dont understand why people like this one at all. art style is cute i guess...

This isn't an MMO, and it used to be a survival game.  And the best part about it was that everything that you gained in a run was part of that run, like a classic roguelike -- and I use the term roguelike intentionally here, instead of roguelite.  The fact that I can grind out 300 hours on a character to fill out a skill tree so they're super powerful for the next time I jump into a game with someone is fucking terrible and ruins the core part of this game that used to be good.

You might die on your first day, but you will learn things over time. You first might survive for 2 days, and then 3, and 4, 5, etc. What I'm trying to point out here about this game is that this game makes you think. Let's say you die on your first time playing. You will learn a game mechanic or not to do something. Then, you will improve and get better. Don't Starve Together itself could be hard for some people to understand, but is insanely fun once you pick it up.

  The first thing that caught my eye was the unusual drawing style and design of everything in the game. I found it very attractive!
Also I really like the games like Terraria and Cult of the Lamb and others like this genre, and those collaborations just blew my mind. I like to see different games collaborating together. Just look at the Lamb drawn in the Klei style or the Deerclops drawn in the Re-Logic style - They are simply magnificent!
  Design of the characters is very memorable, and I can say who is who, what is what and ignoring the color stuff (Yes I am actually colorblind and this variety is called Protanopia.). In the game I didn't feel any discomfort as a colorblind person, and I CONSTANTly enjoy it like a child in every game (If theres no discomfort ye.). Personally, I have a hyperfixation on Wilson, Maxwell and Woodie (Ah yes more like 90% of those 96.5 hours of gaming it all was Wilson, but I saw the gameplay of other characters and all I can say - Magnificent. Also I like those robot, imp and that plant-dude!)
  I was playing the game on the old stages of its life on my friend's laptop and thanks to this game I have a good memories and kind of childhood maybe. And still. And I love to see where this progress this game is making (I feel like I am an uncle watching my brother's son grow up.).
Now briefly for those who wanted to see accurate facts and not just stories from my life;
  Minuses:
- Just one. I remember that I missed mine Insight point and it dissapeared to nowhere (I just opened the Insight menu and didn't choose anything.) by playing as common Wilson. It made me sad but I will recover those points by playing further heh. This says that game has some bugs, but hey, every game has its own bugs. (Also I heard about Shadow Obelisk bug.)
  Pluses:
+ At first this game has A LOTS of content. It may be a minus if you are a lazy-player. I reqired like 50 hrs of game to get to stage with crops and my first bosses (They were Bearger and Deerclops, but I feel sad for Bearger, he is too cute and I wish I could tame him or calm him down so he goes away.) and now I am on my way to learn how to defeat that boss in magma pools biome. ALSO I recommend to learn this game by yourself without wiki! Yes you can pass thru a lot of stuff, but it worth it.
+ At second I am very happy that I can play this game with mine friends. We can explore the Constant and its monsters and starve TOGETHER. We had a lot of funny moments and I am sure this won't end. 
+ At third this game is playable if you have no wish or possibility to donate, and you know the current situation with games without me for sure.

AND at the end I will say if you are too lazy to read all this stuff, here is a four-word summary: I love this game!
And if someone of you has any advises for my current stage of game I would be very happy to see!

Klei Entertainment, thank you for all this! This is one Game of the year for me :D Happy New 2024 year!",1695380557,1701090792,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

BUT hey, at least i've mastered the art of starving together with my friends!!! Who knew that surviving in a virtual wilderness could be so on hilariously challenging? This game has definitely taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and not underestimating the power of a cute little rabbit So if you're looking for a game that will test your survival skills and provide endless laughs. Don't Starve Together is the perfect choice !! Justt remember to pack some sanity-boosting items because you will definitely need them !  ( i know no one will see my review but thank you for reading and watching it and have a nice day :D )

Early players will have a rough start, and unfortunately are often discouraged from playing further however if you watch a couple videos or make your way to the community you'll find heaps of advice to get you through those tricky stages. 

The replay ability is good with randomly generated maps and full flexibility on what and how much spawns on those maps. 

Been playing with my brother for just over a decade and it's always a game that we go back too.

But I always end up all alone
Maybe a few games from home
some friends are willing to make
but it's not all what it takes
to discover this game

Surviving through even the winter
is a challenge, wish they'd know
the other seasons 
ain't kinder
but yet so much more fun to 
plan and manage

But hey hey hey
maybe one day
someone will come up and say
let's play this
and do this
and discover the fun places

So I will wait
and will make no haste
just log in from time to time
collect skins and points
rinse and repeat
copy and paste

It's a fun game to play
and We've had great moments
Just wish that
friends would visit this
more often :)",1542912333,1701039201,True,2,0,0.548387110233306885,0,True,False,False

It is a true masterpiece in the survival genre and completely innovates on it and constantly innovates on itself with a very frequent update schedule. There are 18 unique characters including DLC and almost all of them change your play-style in meaningful ways. The amount of content in this game is staggering, now boasting 20 unique bosses and with an unreal amount of enemy variety that are high quality and unique in their A.I. If survival games disinterest you with the level of grinding required to get results, I completely feel that. DST provides character specific and also a huge variety of ways to get very common resources needed for a slew of different crafting recipes, so any grinding is mitigated almost completely by game knowledge. If you're into base-building, this game is very in-depth with its structures and turfs that can completely change how an area looks while making use of the games bird-eye's view perspective. There is really something for everyone in this truly special game.

modding is a great addition to the game, some mods really are things the game should already have (stackable equipment, larger chests, larger boats, etc), just don't use them to make it too easy for yourself.
big downside is not being able to run caves on a wimpy laptop, or add caves after a world has been generated (even though there are spawn spots where cave entrances could be?). Second big downside is no steam cloud, to play the same game between my desktop and my laptop, I have to manually transfer the save files.

If you like a sandbox type of game and be creative with just about anything, plus a survival game with a creepy atmosphere (but still cute and weird in some ways), also you want to play it with your friends, then this game is definitely for you. Wether you play it with your friends or alone its still very fun and highly addictive.

But 500+ hrs in - and at the time of writing - the game with most hours invested in it - I highly recommend this game. The art style is something you either love or hate - but I found it really suiting to the atmosphere the game conveys.

Lots of stuff to explore (with new stuff introduced every now and then), different challenges every season, tons of community mods - highly recommended. I am about 600 hours in, and I still feel like I'm scratching the surface.

My only issue with the game is lack of any form of overarching campaign - unlike the original Don't Starve, but multiplayer makes up for that!

You will likely die, a lot... I certainly did in the beginning. And over time, got good enough to manage basic survival on my own. This game is harsh, and quite unforgiving. I don't think I have any issues with the game itself. In fact, I'm glad the devs continue to still work on it. I don't think there's an update yet I dislike. And the shorts they create along side them are wonderful. I haven't tried all of the characters after their update, but I am glad that they did character refreshes. Wolfgang and Wx needed one the most. Since one would eat up all the food, and the other would eat up all the gears. But those issues are no more. The only refresh that seems to have an issue, is Wormwood's ability to make regular berry bushes. They require juicy berries to craft, which spawn on a different berry bush. And unless I've missed something, which is possible, they don't spawn in the same world. So you either have one or the other on the map, never both.

As you can see from my playtime, I clearly like the game a lot. But this game also takes a lot of time to ""progress."" I don't really consider that to be a con. But it becomes frustrating when dealing with certain players. It's one thing to be new, or a noob. We've all been there. But there are some with nothing to do in their lives besides troll. I happened to still be alive on an official server by myself. When someone joined trying to convince me to restart the world. When I didn't give in, they tried to jynx me hoping I would die during the hound wave. I didn't, so they, somehow, found where I was and used a fire staff to burn down my base. And because it was just the two of us, there was nothing I could do about it. What made it worse, is there were several US servers that were probably already empty that they could have restarted.

Now obviously this sort of thing isn't new for online games. And if the server had more people on it, that person would have been kicked. And the server would have been rerolled to the previous day to repair the damage. But it is something that still has the potential to happen, so it's worth mentioning. Especially when so much real world time spent progressing through a season can get ruined by just one person at a moments notice.

I guess another con could be that it's sometimes hard to understand what to do besides survive. It's hard for me to adequately speak on this topic, because I've played the game long enough that it's hard to put myself in the shoes of a new player. But the devs felt similarly and made changes to the ui that they hoped would help address those issues.

All in all, it's definitely worth trying. I feel the game has something for just about every type of player. Base building, cooking, gardening, fighting, exploring. And even has mod support, some of which are usable on official servers. Generally, the more people you have, the better your chances at survival.

Edit: It is possible to have both berry bushes on the same map. I'm not sure how often it happens, but sometimes the other type will be in the caves. So as long as you have caves enabled, there's a chance for the other berry type.",1700604569,1700855158,True,16,0,0.683863043785095215,0,True,False,False

Edit: I love how much new content gets added into this game. Anyway, I got a lot better at the game and I realized the skill gap this game has to offer. Time is more important than anything in this game. When you first start, the hard part is just staying alive and making yourself all the items for the next season. But, when you get better, you only want speed, you want to make progress faster. For me, I usually kill dragonfly and queen bee in the first autumn, as well as do a ruins rush and go on the sea. All these are impossible when you first start playing, but with experience you can go as far as killing most bosses in the first autumn.

Though I would only recommend it if you've got friends to play it with as it could get a bit tedious playing alone (hence why despite my love for DS Shipwrecked, I don't play it that much - this is also my plea to Klei to release DST Shipwrecked (pls)). 

Super fun, with tonnes of customisations and game modes. It still has a steady stream of updates and new content, despite being out for almost 10 years, which keeps every exciting and fresh. Art style is unique and gorgeous. Creative gameplay. I quite like the fact that there is no tasks other than the main objective, which is to survive, as it gives me the freedom to play the game and explore however I want and even more so with the copious content from the modding communities. 

Overall, 1000000/10. Absolute classic. Would highly recommend!

Guides are so much helpful and so much thanks to the ones who write the guides on Wikipedia for your time. 
It helps me a lot. I didn't last 5 days before this homework LOL.

By the way , KLEI should consider that the shipwrecked DLC in this game. I mean it's a great DLC but after playing 
multiplayer version, It's become so boring when playing it alone. Please consider this.
Edit: Thank you KLEI, so much for adding the seas.

One more thing , which is out of my reach (when it comes to programming) but I like to say it. 
I don't think the game is compatible to all computers. Because on my laptop, it runs perfectly but on my brother's, 
it keeps saying ''error during initializing'' , I've tried many ways such as reinstalling Reddits, changing compatibility mode
(this usually works) and everything I could do but the problem still remains. 

As a character, my favorite is Wendy . Abigail, her twin sister is so useful.

Thanks for reading my review.

Edit: I give this game The ""Haunts My Dreams"" Award .I just wanna keep playing it. Y'know... :)

- it's possible to create world on your own rules [strike]f.e. disable these ...... frog rains ......... if you don't like them of course[/strike]
- or you can try to create new and harder worlds to survive, make yourself a challenge if you're bored
- you will get good community with help and lots of useful mod to make game even more interesting
- just burn all the trees and destroy everything on your way [strike]my way to relax :D[/strike]",1538255904,1700746659,True,2,0,0.553805768489837646,0,True,False,False

But there's so many complexities to this game and I really appreciate the constant updates and community work Klei does for this series. Adding mods are easy and several are near essential for anyone who cares about organizing their base well. If you like base building survival, this is a great game for you. Playing solo is completely viable and you can kill all the bosses without help.

Oh and if you bought the game recently, check your steam messages for a second copy to gift a friend.

===

The DLC is entirely cosmetic aside from the DLC characters. However it is possible to unlock all the characters and skins (not including discontinued or specific purchase skins) without paying a cent, though it will take a long time to do so.

I am 50.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.",1561996573,1700733141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has been my jam for years now. I honestly don't get sick of it and have fun finding new ways to Not die, not starve, not fall victim to insanity. The art in this game is great and you will find pleasure in things you missed the 1st time playing thru. Also side note this is not just a one hit wonder. They have Don't Starve the original, Hamlet - a harder but amazing DLC, and shipwrecked another fun DLC. I am excited for the future of this game and everything you do. Don't let the hours played on here fool you. I started on PC then moved to my over 1000 hours on my PS4. I own this game on to many platforms, Switch, PS4, Xbox, Steam, IOS and more I think.

The style is my favorite thing about this game though. I bought this game just because I saw some old youtube video of it back when the game first came out, and wow. Just wow. It runs smoothly on all my computers and my mobile devices, and honestly the don't starve franchise is my favorite for just the lore alone - it's not obvious when you first play it or when you're new to the games, but there's a lot to think about in the storyline of these games that it really draws you in!

This game is especially fun with friends, but you can play alone as well! You can edit what you want your world to be full of resource-wise, you can add fanmade workshop items for more fun experiences, and you can just basically go ham on doing the things you want to do with no pressure. With friends, surviving would be a bit easier but just know those chaotic ones do have the power to set things on fire, even if they also worked hard to make said things.

The only gripe I've ever had with this game in all my time owning and playing it is that some of the events, like the arena battle ones, often drag out the worst in players and, if I'm going to be honest here, I'm just not one of those people who are hardcore into arena battles to the point cursing out your team is allowed. I do enjoy the arena battle events with my personal IRL friends, though, all things considered, so that's a plus for anyone who can drag up to six friends into this game during those!

Anyway, this game is really fun to me in that I can build any kind of base set up I want to, which really adds to the fun for me. I like to create bases and defenses, and this ability really made me glad, and I've thrown so much time into this game just building huge bases. It's really addicting, trying to see just how big you can make your little home!

All in all I love this game to bits and highly recommend it for both co-op players and single players. Even just people who like to just chill can enjoy this game. The workshop also makes this game amazing for solo players.",1511697242,1700708315,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It's quite simple, if you do not have play control, you have nothing.  Might as well be watching a movie, really.  It isn't bad but targeting when dealing with a mob is very questionable as you often target the incorrect enemies.

Upon clicking on certain items and even creatures, it will state the intended action, but that action often is not carried out.  This means if you wish to run and attack a creature, it will merely have you run up to the mob and the even that is to be carried out never happens.  When picking up items, this will result in one staring at the item, often stooped over.  This is my primary complaint; it affects any sort of strategy I use in playing the game.

That being said, the game itself is wonderful to play as it is a great survival game noting the crafting, the generated worlds, the unique creatures, the challenge of surviving in a seasonal changing landscape.  Once several processes are understood, one can stay alive as long as he or she wishes.  There are benefits for people playing varied characters as each brings something to the table that can make the game easier in specific situations.

I feel this game is definitely worth the money, it's just a shame that it is receiving more features and more bugs get introduced.  On the other hand, it has definitely paid for itself based on the amount of content that has released since the game was purchased.

There are two experiences the game provides and it is solidly backed up by the mechanics. The game can also be played on a potato without hurting its function, art style or atmosphere so that is a plus for coop with friends who may not have a gaming rig.

Firstly, it is a great survival experience. It puts you in an unfamiliar environment which you must learn and adapt to in order to survive and thrive. It is not, however, a survival simulation. You need to learn the many strange new rules of the Constant and will be surprised (and often killed) by unexpected phenomena and events. In many ways, this is a better simulation of real survival than an actual sim because it puts the player into the mindset of survival rather than merely the mechanics of it. This entire experience may be permanently skipped by reading the wiki, however.

The second thing that it gives is an experience akin to the Fey realms of Celtic mythology. The rules are arbitrary. Things change depending on season. There is little to no magic initially. By discovering the worlds rules and secrets, however, you can build power over the world and come to master it. This is something I have not seen adequately expressed in any other game before and have found to be a satisfying experience.

Now for some of the cons. As noted above, this is not a survival sim. It is a survival sandbox. If you come looking for something on the realistic survival sim spectrum you are going to be disappointed. 

My other major caveat relates to balance. Overall, the game balance works but there are a few points where I feel it is off. For one thing, there is a static balance and the game typically supports anywhere from one through six players. I feel that the balance is geared toward three or four players with one or two being too hard and five or six being too easy (if coordinated). They changed hit points from the original singleplayer for many entities and this does not really add gameplay. Instead it makes the fights tedious for single players and they are still too easy with three or four fighters (usually in party of three or four you will have one or two good fighters). Not a deal breaker and you can absolutely solo the entire game, but it does feel off. 

The other balance is the push toward combat. Despite framing itself as a survival game, fighting is the most important skill in the game. The best stuff is obtained by killing bosses and the non-combat solution to problems are always slower. This is a compounding problem because a combat character can simply face their problems head on and gain from the encounter. The less combat oriented characters take more time and get nothing in exchange. Over time this adds up and there is no payoff for the non-combat characters. Once again, not a deal breaker and I still love the game but it does limit some of the potential and pushes character choice in favor of combat characters (unless there is a really good benefit with the non combat optimized characters). If optimal play puts such a high value on combat that the benefit to a non-combat character needs to be borderline OP to make them a common pick then probably combat skill is too important in the overall gameplay.

DST is still a whole lot of fun and I highly recommend it.",1606337525,1700684593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphic style may not appeal to everyone, but I personally liked it a lot.

There is only one big problem with the game, and let me state it at the beginning;
- The game does not teach you how to play the game; It leaves you straight to the world. This is actually a good thing if the game is not complicated, but the game is not a simple game. I spent most of my hours searching for links between items on wiki pages. I watched the walkthrough online, there are a lot of fine details. And even though this is a survival game, you can't proceed with straight logic because the universe is a different universe and the crafts are different.

Dear Klei my only complaint is, since you are making an unknown game in a different universe, you should at least add something like a tutorial mode. To be able to solve the game. This is one of the reason why new players cant get warm up to this game.

But if we come to the main plus sides;
+ Really fun with friends. Even the single player mode is enjoyable.
+ I think it is very important to be able to mod the game and there is a mod workshop integrated into the game, which is quite nice.
+ Unique Graphics that would appeal to the majority. 
+ Boss variety, craft-food-item variety is very diverse.
+ The game never allows you to develop passively, so even if you are on the 300th day, you have regular daily chores
+ the past stories of the characters are quite sweet. Klei has made short animations for these characters on youtube. I definitely recommend you to watch it. In particular, the stories of characters such as wendy and willow has been integrated very successfully into the game.
+ As you play the game, the mechanics of easily obtaining in-game item drops and collecting them for better items by dismantling them are good, so they did not monetize the game.
+ the universe in which the game takes place is very beautiful. Although it looks isometric, I really liked the 3D cartoonistic feel.
Definitely buy and try with your friends.",1668284553,1700642806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game brings the challenges to the player (seasons, sanity, hunger, health, dangerous animals, weather, bosses, and much much more). This is a game that makes the player discover everything on their own, which may seem a little daunting at first. Without external help you may be lost sometimes, but as you play with others it's always enjoyable to learn as you go. 

In this game you can take on many roles to aid in you and your friends survival. You can learn to farm, learn to harvest resources, learn to fight. You can explore all of the biomes, the caves, the ruins, the islands, the ocean. There is so much to explore! In addition to all of this, there are several bosses that are challenging but rewarding to defeat. For most players, the game isn't about not starving but having fun doing so!

Don't Starve Together also includes 18 playable characters (4 are unraveled with in-game currency that is given to you for just playing) each of which have dramatically different play styles. You can be a master chef, a handy-woman, a bodybuilder, a plant, an average guy, a lumber jack, a librarian, a robot, a singer/actor, a mime, a monster, a boy scout, a literal fish, and many more. Each character has advantages and disadvantages that keeps the game interesting. Also they all have amazing skins!

After a while of playing this game you'll look back on your early days and all of the little challenges that seemed so big at that time will now be the least of your worries. Now you can experience the game for what it's worth, which isn't only surviving but thriving! Amazing game!",1695012365,1700621691,True,5,1,0.556962013244628906,0,True,False,False

The combat mechanics while simple can be difficult for some to pick up, and the sanity management early game is a struggle at times. However, this game doesn't kick down at newer inexperienced players for not ""getting good"" and provides many solutions in it's large character roster that provide different experiences for everyone's play style.

These guys are the real gamers who are constantly working to make this work and I can see that. Hopefully this game farther develop. If you like original 'Don't Starve', you are likely to fall for this one as well. Here's pros and cons of this game:
Pros: Get to play Don't Starve in multiplayer. Also RoG contents are included/in process (still beta after all)
Cons: Host-guest game sync issues (latency). Some bugs since still in development. Major bug is where server is no longer joinable by others or particular players. Many times not good game experience with strangers. Too many noobs. :p

Updated: Jan 2, 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Klei is still making more contents! This really amazes me. Playing this game since the beta, I thought after official release from beta, no more contents would be made after fixing bugs. But game continues to add contents. Contents with background stories that puzzles players. The lores and the mysteries that it entails. Its amazing. Very in depth of a game. It takes a form of what is a survival roguelike RPG into deeper and deeper stage buildling on top of it. Who knows it might turn out to be something like of MMORPG? It has limitless potential. Only truely skilled players may be able to conquer the game to its depths.

Updated: Aug 17, 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The updates are still coming, slowly. Devs have made skins as part of their revenue to be able to continue the updates, and the skins feel to have more quality than the update itself. New character release and character rework are being done, as well as progressive update on new contents (of which I believe is better to play when fully completed). Over recent years, I believe some updates need to be better thought through however. 'Return of Them' doesn't seem to hold close relation to the rest of the game set at this moment, feels distant and not uniquely desirable to do. Character rework for Woodie and Wendy are quite disappointing. The difficulty of using Woodie has always been the case, but the rework doesn't seem to make difference to that, nor useful other than the goose transformation and always existed fast woodcutting. The full moon transformation feels more like time waster than a challenge for experienced players. For new players, it'll feel like no other than instant death call. Worrying about food to eat for after transformation is more of a concern than actually using the content of transformation. Wendy rework for Abigail is something, but doesn't seem to be any more useful than before. Killing spiders has always been the same thing and that's about it. Trying to look and helping small ghosts is time waster that doesn't add time-worthy effect for Abigail. Willow rework seemed pretty good, except BERNIE! makes sound not matching for the game theme. Wortox on the other hand, I very much applaud on. Many characters still need to be reevaluated to be usable not only the beginning of the game, but also late game. Despite these cons, I feel like there are other  contents and characters that are very much worthy playing for, so still would recommend to play.

It's amazing to play with friends, but I don't recommend the non edited world to players that play really casually. If you play casually you can set your world to however you like it (how many monsters, resources etc.) Overall an amazing game and definitely worth 15 euros at the normal price and everytime it's on sale. Great work from Klei on this game and the frequent patches that they do that add things.

Finally got tired of my favorite game franchise having no new content since the single player DS is finished and decided to pick up DST as I've long heard it's playable solo.

Well it's been, I don't know, not even 6 months and I already have more hours in DST than DS. Suffice to say it's absolutely worth your time, just know the survival aspects, particularly acquiring food, are somewhat easier while the mobs and bosses have more health. New bosses are substantially more difficult/complex than DS bosses and raid bosses require lots of time and resource investment as a solo player. You will probably require research and practice to learn the new bosses and how to defeat them. If you're struggling just know panflutes, weatherpains, gunpowder, and catapults are there to even the odds when fights are designed for multiple people. But it is absolutely do-able.

The characters are better after their overhauls and getting even more improvement now with skill trees. There is significantly more content in the game than the previous one. A lot of it, however, is starting to feel redundant, it's become a bit bloated. But, we have real late game content now. The steps to get to late game are...convoluted, and you'll likely need the wiki. Ultimately I'm constantly busy for about 3 in-game years doing stuff, with moderate base building effort, and progressing the game. It is even more addictive than DS. A mechanic to reward multiple runs with different characters would add to that. Alas, once you beat final bosses the skill tree branches are unlocked for everyone. 

DST still is receiving content updates btw. Possibly years worth. Highly recommend if you liked DS, just know this is a solid step up in involvement. If you don't like hidden mechanics you have to wiki(they have added a scrapbook mechanic to help this), durability on everything, and a general grinding aspect, you might not like this game. If you haven't played DS before, maybe go through DS+ROG before this. You really have to see if you find the game loop and art addictive. But yeah for 15 bucks I'm definitely going to amass over 1k hours so I think that speaks for itself.",1700451017,1700451377,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Once you understand how to take care of you primal needs, you're free to do whatever you want : from exploring the lands, to fighting monsters, makings animal friends/allies, farming and making sure you have enough ressources for the winter, creating your own place, sailing across the sea or exploring caves... Characters you pick also have very different gameplays. 

Even after 100h, you still discover new things when you play and it's still fun to try to understand how you should handle these situations. A huge plus is that Klei Entertainement still updates the game after 7 years. There's events based on real life calendar (Hallowed Nights, Winter's Feasts, The Forge, The Gorge, ...) , new weapons and characters, they rebuild old mecanics,....
Another great thing about Don't Starve Together is the community : there are tons of really cool mods ! You can play as who you want, some mods allows you to have very useful pets, others helps you with gameplay (shared map, respawn at camp, ....) it's fun to lurk in the workshop to see what exists.

If you want to play a game with your friend, this is a great game to pick ! Just be aware that some players might not like the fact that you could die on the spot from a meteor shower or an angry bird that you brought to camp by mistake :)",1700390979,1700390979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played it the most with my cousin, Krys. He and I were best friends, and we learned how to play the game together. We became so good at it too. We'd discuss strategies, send each other awesome mods we could add to our server, watch DST YouTubers and give each other tips on how to play certain characters. 

I remember he suddenly dropped by my house and stayed there for a week, and yes, all we did during that entire week was play DST like crazy. During Christmas I bought my friends and cousins skins of their favorite characters. For Krys, it was Wigfrid, because she was so easy to play and quite literally at times ignored the rules of the DST world. 

I'd forever treasure these memories.

Today was supposed to be his 23rd birthday. It's been months since I last even touched the game. Opening it is difficult, actually playing it is downright impossible. I look at our old servers together and realizing that I'll never get to play those with him ever again breaks my damn heart. 

Four hundred hours and still it wasn't enough time with him. 

This game is really great to play with friends or family. Learning how to survive in the DST world is fun in its own way too. The lore of the Don't Starve series is one of my favorite. I hope you guys can continue to enjoy this game in my place.

Happy birthday Krys, and I hope you're happy, wherever you are.",1624187139,1700036682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is clunky, and unfair, healing is difficult, crafting is a series of unintuitive menus, and the game's not really sure whether it wants to be a survival sim, or an exploration sim, or a combat sim, or whether it wants to have a story.

When you die, it can take hours to get back to your where you left off. Basically, there's no point in playing this game unless you have friends.

Living on a small farm underneath the blue sky.
Now this story I warn you is not for those faint of heart,
For our sad tale begins with a boy's troubled start.
All the boy ever wanted was just be seen,
Noticed by his father who never meant to be mean.
He was absorbed in his work no time for play or talk,
And the boy grew to despise the click of that lock.
As the lonely days passed, jealous thoughts filled his mind,
The boy turned to naughtiness when once he was kind.
So he came up with a plan to get Papa's attention,
And one fateful night he broke into his father's collection.
Contraptions, treasures, and oddities galore,
He tipped over the glass case and it shattered on the floor.
Out came a spider, it gave the bad boy a fright,
Eight eye peeled into his soul and it lunged in for a-
Oh turn away my dear friend. I don't want you to see,
For this boy and this spider were not meant to meet.
For that night with one bite they became something new,
A boy and arach, now one no longer two.
His parents screamed and they yelled in fright at the sight,
And chased him away where he got lost in the night.
He was cold and was scared. he vowed he'd be nice,
He begged for a way to change back, no matter the price...",1561682008,1699212322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a statement on the life and world we live in, and our gloomy march to our inevitable death. I'm not going to sit here and tell you things you already know. [spoiler] ""There's 4 seasons, stay away from darkness, for the love the cooked green mushrooms give sanity!"" [/spoiler] You've heard that a million times. But what drives all these players to play? What makes somebody spend either less than 100 hours on Don't Starve Together or spend their entire life on it? I'd like to review that in this review.
[h2] This game is big [/h2]
Like, [b] REALLY [/b] big. Don't starve together has this 2.5D look to it, meaning that most things you see are just solid PNG's that rotate with the camera. It brings a sort of pop-up story book look to it. Stylish and compact. This also means that with all these simple pictures Don't Starve Together can handle a lot at once. Sure, multiple things have animations and movement and effects, but it's going to take a lot to crash the game [strike] except for that one time that one guy used pine cones. I digress. [/strike] And with such a large open space for creativity to flow, the devs let loose. Beautiful and amazing stories are told through the adventure your character takes from place to place, fighting battles and solving puzzles, all trying to stop the big bad guy [spoiler] Which one the bad guy is, is something still undecided [/spoiler] . It's a wonder how many people don't see how huge this game is. Letting a survival game get almost monthly updates for years means one thing and one thing only: those thousands of hours some players have were spent doing something, not nothing.
[h2] Re-Replayability [/h2]
You can only get so far in vanilla Minecraft. Live only in the caves, in the sky, no food, no weapons, no armor... you get the idea. But most of that stuff is for looks. Nothing really... changes. Don't Starve Together boasts a collection of 18 different unique characters, all fully updated and ready to go. You could play as one character and fight all the bosses, then go to the next, and the next, and the next. That's 18 different playthroughs if you the distance. And each character, with their unique mechanics, will have you going a different path each time (If you're looking for efficiency) Webber has his spiders, instead of his pigs. Wanda ages over time and does better when weak. Wigfrid is a carnivore, Wurt is a herbivore, Wormwood can't heal from food, Winona is temporary in your playthroughs, Walter doesn't exist, Wes... should be renamed 'hard mode' and Wilson is Wilson. So 18 different unique playthroughs. Well you could also take each character and try to kill a specific boss as fast as possible, or get down to this challenging area called The Ruins as fast as possible, or you could  try to make Twinkies as fast as possible. There's always a reason to come back.
[h2] This server has mods enabled [/h2]
Don't Starve Together has a passionate development team. And a passionate community. And when you give a community a game, what are they gonna want? A workshop. Don't Starve Together's style makes it pretty easy to mod whatever you want in [strike] that was a joke, modders please don't kill me [/strike] jokes aside, Don't Starve Together's modders are talented individuals, capable of adding tons to the game with the tools provided. Some give you quality of life enhancements, like Geometric Placement and Status Announcements. Others give you 'quality of life' enhancements, like nightvision. So don't get those ones. Mods I just listed are client-side mods, that can be enabled for any game, regardless if it's vanilla/nobody else has them. The server-side mods are mods that you can add to a server you host, and can range from showing your location on the map for others (Global positions), to adding basically an entire new mode to the game (Uncompromising mode), to adding Super Smash Brothers as a fully functional game (Smashup). So on top of this vanilla replayability, you have another 400 hours of more replayability.
[h2] Accept my friend request [/h2]
Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer game. Hence the 3rd word in it's name. But the developer's want for you to go multiplayer can be ignored, as this game is also functional single-player. It's fun to get a bunch of friends or strangers at your skill level and start a world, exploring together. Or you could go solo, and face the challenges of game design going against you. The game is possible single-player, but is just more difficult. I'd highly recommend not playing Don't Starve Together on public servers with random people. The problem is that most professionals in the game... won't really help new players out. And the last thing you want to do is be blindly carried around, not learning anything. So go with some friends, test stuff out, die together! Or play solo, and find things out alone while working extra hard to survive. But be ready for one thing.
[h2] Death, your new teacher [/h2]
You're going to die a lot. A LOT. And once that reset button pops up, don't just leave. Death is part of the game. You're going to die, but that's the intended game design. You die from darkness? alright, get some light. There's low temperatures that kill you? alright, get some fire. The robots shoot stuff, get armor and tank. Lightning hurts, get a lightning rod. On and on it goes. The thing in Don't Starve Together that you're shooting for is to not die. And after a while... yeah you'll get there. But how do you make it easier? You could do the bare minimum and survive years and years, but that's going to be difficult and boring. So... let's go to the ocean! Or let's go delve underground! Learn the cook book, the farming mechanics, go kill a specific boss. Expand your horizons and shoot for the moon, and everything will come to you. And if you risk your life for the journey and make it, you'll be rewarded with tools and materials that make life easier. And in turn, make you a GOD. You'll go from surviving the world to CONQUERING the world. All it takes...

It's Hard to see flaws in a game that is constantly bugfixed by devs with updates that happen very often!

In that long time i've really enjoyed to play singleplayer and with a few guys that became my friend and are still my friends after a decade lol

If you have trouble in surviving: enjoy that time cause sooner or later you will know how to never die ingame and that make the game a little too easy once mastered sadly!

To learn the game do not jump into multiplayer, try to play alone and learn the basics cause with strong player you learn nothing and with newbies you die even faster haha! Anyway enjoy it!!!

Easy to learn, really hard to master. This is one of the best survival games you can play with friends (and by yourself). If you felt like the world was too big, empty and loreless in games like minecraft this game is for you. You don't like waiting 2 years for a new update? This game is for you. You don't want to pay a lot of money for a game? This game is for you. But not everything in the game is that good and as someone who has over 500 hours in the world of Don't Starve Together I am sure of that. 

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Advantages[/h2]
- Probably best fact about the game - when you buy it you get second copy for your friend.
- Game has really deep lore that connects with other Don't Starve games and DLC's
- Game is really entertaining. You can spend hundreds of hours on one save with things to do.
- A lot of enemies, bosses, mechanics, bioms, events and even some dungeons!
- A lot of settings that are easy to manage. You can change each thing mentioned above.
- A lot of community servers.
- A lot of mods. Making mods for this game is really easy and using them is even easier.
- You can search for mod, add it into your save and you don't even have to leave the game.
- Creators really love this game. They add huge updates at least three times a year
- Simple and easy to learn crafting and a lot of items and hidden recipes that you can make.
- Every day you get free item custom and during events you get a lot of free item customs.
- A lot of characters and they are adding new ones or rework the old ones once in a while.
- ...And because of that you can cook with team comps or look for already working ones.
- Audio and Video is really good. My room is a rave when spring theme kicks in.
- No matter how much hours you have in the game - there will always be a challange for you.
- It's really easy to revive yourself if you die...
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Disadvantages[/h2]
- ...Because you will die a lot.
- Graphic style of the game is not for everyone.
- You can master crafting after playing the game for 5 hours.
- You have mental illness if you don't switch off cave monkeys and worms.
- A lot of weapons, mechanics and just stuff is useless or you can get cheaper substitutes.
- Game is bugged. You can easily get your save destroyed if you're not carefull enough. 
- Creators once made items worth 10x game price worthless.
- If you are playing DST alone your first saves are probably going to be doomed since it's pretty hard with some ""events"". Also surviving your first winters is really hard.

However playing now even on the next to easiest mode is too punishing for new players who don't know what they are doing. In today's abundance of video games, I don't have more than 30 minutes to decide if I want to play something or not. I guess that's just how games mature over time, changing their target audience from new players who want to learn the game to more seasoned players.

Its far more fun when you play with friends and dont forget you get an extra copy, to gift to someone. 
And just because of that the game deserves much respect. 
Its constantly getting updated and theres a big community.

I don't hate this game for being hard, its just something so complicated and needs lots of dedication, its a WiKi game like Terraria, you will never know what to do next when looking around in the game. So if you wanna have fun or even know just what you are doing you'll need a tab dedicated to the WiKi cause god help you try and figure it out by yourself.

Even with friends who ""help"" you in the end you'll just end up being a weight to be dragged with until after hours of game play you'll finally understand what to do and then deal with brutal game mechanics. Which you can get around with mods but I am not someone who immediately likes to fill their game with 50+ mods.

Amidst loyal companions wielding pixelated spears and guided by a wickedly delightful sense of humor, embark on a fanciful journey as you navigate the intricate maze of this enthralling chaos.

The experience greets you with its Tim Burton-esque art style, like someone spilled a pot of ink on a creepy storybook. The characters are all quirky and oddly adorable, but let's not forget the time I mistook a Koalefant for a walking broccoli. Talk about a veggie-themed jump scare! Who needs realism when you can have charm?

Prepare to embrace the art of survival, because in this game, everything is trying to kill you. The day-night cycle is relentless, and you'll find yourself racing against time, stuffing your face with berries like a squirrel on steroids. And don't get me started on the sanity meter! It drops faster than my hopes of finding a 5-star chef in the wilderness. The struggle to stay sane is real, my friends.

Cooperative play is all about teamwork, right? Well, try telling that to my friend who decided it would be hilarious to light the base camp on fire while I was out picking flowers. Thanks, pal. If you're lucky enough to have reliable teammates, you can divide the tasks and build a thriving base. But if your friends are like mine, get ready for a comedy of errors that could rival a slapstick routine.

The fauna deserves a standing ovation for their sheer variety and their imaginative ways of ensuring your untimely demise. From the hounds that attack in packs, making you run around like a headless chicken, to the deerclops that stomps through your base like a drunken giant, the wildlife here is more chaotic than a group of toddlers on a sugar rush.

Each character comes with their own unique perks and quirks. You have your fearless Wolfgang, who can devour a whole fridge in seconds but gets jittery at the sight of a butterfly. And let's not forget about Wickerbottom, the walking encyclopedia who knows all the secrets of the world but has the bedtime of a cranky toddler. These characters add depth and humor to the gameplay, making every choice a delightful dilemma.

Briefly, Don't Starve Together is an experience that will make you laugh, cry, and question your sanity (both in-game and in real life). It's a game where death is not just a possibility but an inevitability, and every failed attempt is a chance to learn and improve. With its whimsical art style, hilarious mishaps, and absurd survival mechanics, this game will keep you entertained for hours on end. So gather your exploration team, pack your wits, and embark on this delightful expedition of survival and lunacy. Just remember: when in doubt, run away from the frogs!",1689176631,1696627081,True,21,2,0.660990536212921143,0,True,False,False

Ofcourse game is beautyful and very interesting if u plaing with a friends (and then u play with friends FIRSTLY like them too).
so remember if u buy the game... get ready for u die in next 1-5 days.
From other side almost evryone was confused how to survive and starting the game cause it's need a lil logic to think what do i do and how i need to plan my next steps. So thats why the game is hard, u need to know all ur steps and planning ur steps to +5 cause if u dont plan ur steps u gonna..... DIE DIE AND DIE AGAIN :D

Its not fun to make armor and a weapon only to have it break in 10 seconds in one combat encounter and make a new set just to have it break again. I don't feel motivated to do anything when everything is so temporary and fleeting. I don't want to spend resources on something that's just going to break,
Additionally the combat is just frustrating enemies do an obscene amount of damage and there is nothing besides citing and armor to deal with it, citing isn't a fun or indepth mechanic in any game its the bare minimum lowest effort way to design combat, there is no dodging, blocking, parrying to speak of so it ends up feeling unengaging and tedious.

I refer to this game as one of the ""harder versions of Minecraft"" and a wiki game (as in there's so many items and features involved its going to take A WHILE to know most unless you constantly refer to the wiki, which still makes the game fun if you do search up everything).

It also offered the typical survival instincts I craved from other games, cooking food in the wilderness, huddling around the campfire at night, seasons with change of weather, etc. Although the game is hard for a period of time after starting off, it will eventually get easy and boring in some cases (depending on how long you've been playing and if you got all the exclusive season items each during the first year). Even then, if you're committed to the game, its not hard to find something to do to keep you entertained for the next couple years in game.

Super fun progression system, good atmosphere and a real rough survival feel! The only issue is that the re-playability is really bad. Once you have completed the game once, there is basically no reason to play again, maybe except for trying a different character.

I would still recommend this game though, since those first few playthroughs and that one playthrough where you beat the game are super fun! Don’t play this alone though, this a definitely a game to play with friends! Me and my old gaming buddies have had a blast with this game, and it’s why I’ve got so many hours into the game.

Don't Starve Together may lure you in with its charming Tim Burtonesque visuals, but beneath the surface, it's a tedious and frustrating experience. The grind is mind-numbing, resembling a dull flash game. Permadeath, instead of being a learning experience, feels unfair and unpredictable, making you start over after hours of progress. Combat is uninspired, requiring little more than clicking or running away.

Repetitive gameplay and restrictive mechanics stifle exploration and creativity, pushing you to focus solely on survival. The arrival of winter exacerbates this issue, forcing players to rush progress. Moreover, the game's lack of transparency means it's practically unenjoyable without a Wiki open to explain its cryptic mechanics. While it initially seems promising, Don't Starve Together ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying and enjoyable experience. Save your time for more rewarding games.

The core gameplay loop is die until you stumble into the the correct answer, kind of like Groundhog Day or Tomorrow War. I've seen lots of reviews trying to explain that you only need to put in the time to memorize the important recipes, forget the humongous pile of useless ones, and get the spacing and kiting down for every mob type. After that, you're golden! My counterpoint is that great games such as Witcher 3, Mass Effect, Titanfall 2, V Rising, Starcraft, and Diablo 2 have identified their core gameplay loop and help you with nudges to get you to that experience in less than 10 hours, let alone 100. It is gated behind a blind-stumble experience that can be substituted with 10's of hour of wiki reading and memorization. In fairness, I'm not a big survival game guy, but I tried with a dedicated group of friends and it still wasn't a fulfilling experience. If you like the games I listed above and are a bit hesitant, I would probably steer clear. If you adore dropping dozens of hour of learning experience into a game, by all means, call me a filthy casual and play to your hearts content.

Playing online with others is an awesome experience, and the more the merrier. The crafting system is pretty unique, complex, enjoyable, and you will learn something new every time. Art style is awesome obviously, and there is a bunch of cosmetics you can unlock simply by playing the game. Seeing how far you survive can be a pretty rewarding experience as well.

-Co-op can be a little unpleasant as a non-host, because of how position heavy combat is. Me personally I think the game is much better with friends, so I wouldn't recommend it for solo play unless you really enjoy survival games. The gameplay can be quite awkward when it comes to equipping, picking up items, and targeting.

As long as you don't search for too much info you're in for a world of fun. When i first started playing this with the better half we couldn't survive past the first wolf raid. Yea we were very bad, trial and error(and less getting panicked during attacks) and persistence have paid off. We can survive above ground no problem(haven't done much sea exploring yet) and have slowly ventured into the caves. One thing that kinda drags the game out is the need to visit some area called a ruins to craft anything past the basic magic stuff. So been stuck at that point for weeks and still enjoying it. We have a tendency to start over almost daily just for the fun of setting up a base, seeing what works against creatures of ALL sizes for defending etc.

The combat is atrocious, because it boils down to following a specific combination of clicking the enemy, running away, and swapping your extremely fragile tools and armour.

After the recent developments in the game however, I have simply found the game not nearly as fun. It felt like no matter what we did in the game we were either starving or losing minds or health. Couldn't travel far enough away with the recent cold aspect to go in search of flowers for my mental health or find food so I wouldn't starve. It seemed like I as a player couldn't win for losing. If you travel too far away from the fire you get cold and take health damage, but you need to travel far away to search for food so you ""DON'T STARVE"" and flowers so you can create flower crowns to prevent yourself from going crazy. This ultimately led to all 3 depleting rather rapidly at once and well needless to say I think this will be my last time playing the game. If you enjoy that type of frustration, than by all means play the game.

Wendy is a bit better but still lacking in appeal, I prefer the blonde hair that she has. Blondes are more easy to control since they are lacking on the intelligent side which is shown perfectly since her eyes are white. Clearly, her master sprayed his white juice on her eyes so she was indefinitely blinded. That's why I prefer Wendy, also because of Wendy's. Love their food. I'm also into guys. That's why Woodie's massive beard is a true joy for me to see, he's the sole reason I grew a glorious beard like his. Finally, Maxwell, what a man. Ideal villain, an ideal villain should of course not just petrify you with fright but as well with sexual strife, his long body, tall body that he possesses makes my skin shiver.

+ Huge, completely random and unpredictable environment? Have.

+ Potential dangers, unnamed threats? Much.

+ Scarcity of food, tools, and safe haven? Sure.

+ The risk of buying back the keyboard - mouse - LCD screen - the case after a few dozen times of dying for stupid reasons in the game? Very possible.

And since Don't Starve Together emphasizes multiplayer, what's new and exciting is the rich cast of characters, with lots of special skills for players to choose from.",1693333447,1693333447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
322330,145272914,76561198256426455,0,1,8459,0,970,1696725648,"""Don't Starve Together"" promised cooperative survival fun, but what I got was a frustrating mess that left me wondering if playing alone would have been a better choice. While it's an interesting concept to survive with friends, the execution leaves much to be desired.

First and foremost, the learning curve is steep enough to give a mountain climber vertigo. The game does a terrible job of explaining its mechanics, leaving you to stumble through the basics with your friends, often resulting in collective confusion. Crafting, managing hunger, and dealing with sanity all feel more like chores than enjoyable gameplay elements.

The art style that worked for the single-player version somehow feels out of place in a multiplayer context. The screen can get cluttered, making it hard to differentiate between characters and the environment, leading to accidental deaths and frustration.

Speaking of frustration, the lack of balance in the difficulty is baffling. Encounters with enemies can range from trivial to infuriatingly unfair, and the progression doesn't feel satisfying. It's as if the game is designed to punish you for trying to cooperate, which defeats the purpose of a multiplayer experience.

The game's bugs and glitches are inexcusable. I've lost count of how many times I or my friends got stuck in terrain, forcing us to quit and reload. And don't get me started on the server stability—disconnects are frequent, making any attempt at long-term progress an exercise in futility.

In the end, ""Don't Starve Together"" seems like a missed opportunity. The potential for cooperative survival fun is there, but the game's myriad issues overshadow any enjoyment that might have been had. If you're a glutton for punishment and enjoy hours of trial and error, this might be the game for you.

The most distinctive feature of the game is its unique visual style and atmosphere. The world, drawn in a dark and gothic art style, envelops players in a deep mystery. The day-night cycle, weather changes and seasons bring a strategic approach to the game.

The multiplayer experience adds a social and co-operative dimension to the game. By cooperating with friends or online players, you can gather resources, build bases and defend against dangerous creatures. However, sometimes lack of communication between players or different play styles can affect in-group co-operation or competition.

The game's difficulty and learning curve may cause players to struggle in the beginning. However, these challenges also provide depth and fulfilment to the game. To survive, it is important to develop skills such as managing resources, cooking, and coping with seasonal challenges.

The game's extensive mod support allows players to customise the experience and add new content. This adds long-lasting playability to the game.

Overall, ""Don't Starve Together"" is a game that stands out for its unusual art style, deep atmosphere and survival mechanics. Playing with friends or online communities is one of the most fun aspects of the game, while the challenges and mysteries draw you into the game.",1692721853,1693135282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game goes on sale A LOT

Possibly infinite replayabilty due to it being a sandbox survival game (similar to terraria length of replayability)

Wide variety of playable characters each with different stats and or play styles

Randomly generated world

Cons:

No hand holding at all, no tutorial on combat or how to survive. This was a con in my opinion as it forced me to fail and die over and over, until I watched an hour long tutorial on YouTube. I didn’t feel motivated to spend hours and days of my life learning how to even be able to play the game, which is what stopped me from playing it. (Probably just a skill issue for me)

Combat is incredibly unique and gimmicky, you hit something a certain amount of times (varies between enemy) and then run away to dodge their attack. This was what the combat experience consisted of for me during my short playthrough and I felt that it was very boring and frustrating.

Randomly generated world

Im not recommending this game simply because I felt like there are better options to play out there. This game is incredibly hard to get into casually unless you want to spend countless hours learning one feature after another (resource gathering, combat, base building, etc) I feel like it goes on sale often to convince people it’s worth it to buy this game because you get two copies, but when you try to play it blind you lose over and over and over, until you finally give in and google how to do something.

I would give it a try still since you can refund if you’ve played for less than two hours and see what you think of the game.",1693095417,1693095417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is really fun. I've played it with family and friends, online, and solo, and no matter who I was playing with, it's been a blast. Survival has tons of possible playstyles and is constantly being updated and reworked to stay balanced. The developers clearly care about this game and are updating it frequently. I personally am a forge player, which is a retired game mode that can still be accessed with mods. It's more fast-paced and great if you enjoy combat. I have admittedly less experience with gorge, a game mode that is also only playable with mods, but from what I can tell it's fun. The storyline in this game is great, with well-written and fun characters. The visuals are good and the ragtime is great. The controls are simple and intuitive. It's relatively difficult but not unfairly so. The bosses are mostly good, the mechanics are fun, the community is very positive, and overall, I'd suggest it.",1664151999,1693068406,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
