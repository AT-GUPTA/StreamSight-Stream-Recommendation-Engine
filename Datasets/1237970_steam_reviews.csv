Probably can run on some AMD integrated APU's as long as they are toward the higher end of APU's chart. I even tested it on my Acer ultra book with a six core AMD CPU and RTX 3050 at 40W and I was getting north of 120fps at 1080p high settings (just FYI game is cap at 144FPS on PC / Xbox Series consoles 120FPS with FPS boost). VRAM for me was the limiting factor on my ultra book. The game looks great, I personnel love the source engine and I had no issues regardless of what system I ran it on. Being the PC version needs EA's own launcher to run as well is a drawback for me. If I'm buying on Steam that should be good enough. Titanfall is my favorite shooter it's so fast and smooth and rewarding to play. The community size seem to be pretty good on PC I've observed around 3,000 players and I play off peak times. Single player story mode is great if a little short. The only two online modes I was able to find games in reliably were attrition (PVP with titans) and frontier defense (4 player PVE).  

I believe a lot of new players will be turned off by the skill gap that will be vary obvious from the start. All Titanfall games are very fast paced with split second reactions being key. The game seem to have little to no skill based matchmaking. As I was new I was put into matches with top tier players of god like skills. Maybe is because the player base is kind of small but most all the matches I've played were very lopsided, your either going to win by a landslide or lose by a landslide. I did however have a few good close matches but I can count them on one hand so not many. If you stick with it and unlock equipment as you level you will improve your skills. It dose support controller but I would recommend keyboard and mouse if you want to be competitive on the PC version. K&M is how I play it. 

Now the reason I feel I can't recommend the PC version of Titanfall 2, the aimbots and hackers in the online. I don't think EA monitors this game or ever did. It's very obvious if you look in the lobbies just highlight a players name that looks out of place like they rolled there face on their keyboard to create there name and then look at there stats. The time played - how many matches they have played - how many games they have won - how many kills they have - how much they are worth - what level they are at will not add up in any persons mind. If that's not clear enough I've ran into hackers and aimbot in game more times then I would like to admit and even in Frontier defense and that blows my mind.  In Frontier defense you can level weapons but not titans you use in PVP so I guess that would be one reason why to cheat in a PVE mode? 

Another issue with PC is you may not be able to connect to Respawns servers if your on a newer computer. This requires you to change a setting in Windows environmental settings to get it to work. I've also observed that more players on PC use broken builds/load-outs that are known to be over powered or broken from launch. I guess if you want to make the game easy in PVP just use a over powered build, I'm not sure why this is so prominent on PC but it stands out. it is part of the game so it's not cheating it is what it is and the developer never changed anything for the most part regarding weapon balancing. 

I guess if I never spent time on the console versions of this game maybe these issues wouldn't be that big of a deal. But the fact is I have and on Console I have a ton of time played on the game and I haven't run into hackers / aimbots. The console player base don't seem to utilize the over powered load-outs nearly as much as players do on PC so take that for what it's worth. Online matches seem to be way more competitive on console, the matches are much closer with less blowouts. It's still and amazing game on PC, good story and if not for the flaws of online cheating would be a solid recommendation but for me I'll be spending more of my titanfall time on console as that experience is way more enjoyable and not filled with as may issues. 

On a side note: if your looking for the original titanfall game the only way to play it now is on xbox as EA messed up the pc version and it's no longer playable. You either need to own it digitally already as EA has pulled it off the xbox store or get the game disc. The original Titanfall on xbox still has a small but solid player base at peak play times on weekends but is not nearly as big as Titanfall 2.

i seen this gem for 5 dollars the other day i was quick to install, a quick multi sesh before jumping back into the campaign on my 4080 machine, the nostalgia and love came rushing all back at once, i don't even need to finish the campaign to leave a review on this absolute masterpiece of story telling, advanced movement features, and graphics well ahead of its time.

this game brings back soo many halo memories of when i was a kid, and you really do share a strong bond with BT, this is a campaign made by respawn entertainment in there absolute prime, love,passion,skill, sweat and tears went into this story and you are reminded of it along the way.

the graphics are deadset stunning, the movement is perfection, the gun play and titan play just nothing short of pure skill, character writing and development perfection, atmosphere,music i mean the list goes on.

you know i dont think this game was released at the right time, something tells me if it was released today it would be MASSIVE,

the multiplayer .. my favourite fps of all time 1 and 2, the servers are butter, connection butter, you can still find matches easy enough, the maps, guns, titan play everything is fantastic, this really deserves to be re released to the public today i think they could be sitting on something extroadinary (its waaaaaaayyyyy better then apex) difference between love and money.

The campaign, from a story perspective is just a filler and its mediocre at best. The level design and the platforming elements are nice but that's about it. The multiplayer has no skill based matchmaking system so its not newbie friendly at all. The game has a small community and most matches you will be fighting against veteran players. They know the maps by heart, they have all the weapon and titan upgrades. The wall running and the other mechanics are interesting.

Since the game doesn't have any anti cheat many people use soft aim assists or chronus zen and wall hacks. There is even a cheat that allows you to get your titan in the first minute of the game or another that makes it so you don't lose all your life when others hit you. Basically shots aren't registered. Sometimes the servers go wonky from 50ms ping to 300ms, game starts to look choppy and you die not knowing what or how it hit you and the kill cam shows something entirely different than what you saw on the screen previous to your demise :). Also because of the servers there are hit registration issues, where your shots arent detected or you sometimes die behind a wall.
Also the community is very toxic. People fill the chat with slurs depending on what titan, weapon or boost you pick. Sometimes you get in balanced lobbies and then its fun but its rare and its more of a coin flip.

The core gameplay is balanced perfectly between the lightning fast and smooth movement on foot, and the slow, hulking, powerful feeling of controlling a titan. There are few other shooters that make you feel like a badass as much as this game does. Story-wise, it's not going to blow you away or anything, but it works perfectly for what it needs to be, with the development of the central characters' relationship being surprisingly interesting and emotional at times.

Basically everything good about the campaign's gameplay also applies to the multiplayer and frontier defense gamemode, it's all super fast-paced and incredibly fun.

Well this isn't it because games are virtual goods so it's kind of hard for one to fall in love like in a physical sense however that does not mean that one can not appreciate something that isn't real and in that sense, as other reviews and a lot of them can contest at this moment in time (overwhelmingly positive), a lot of people feel this way about this particular game.

For one I was a fan of Star Wars: Republic Commando, a tactical shooter that reminds me of this game and even though this particular game feels more arcadey that does not take away from its core.

What I see when I look at the core, without staring is that the game looks beautiful and that it plays really nicely. This combination is already something that would engage me with a product like this and on top of that I really am interested that is to say: intrigued by the story. I already kind of am a fan of technology and the potential future it holds, albeit depicted in a warring sense in this game but still it does not take away from the wonder of it all. I think the developers have been meticulous in designing and building this game and it shows.

I do like it a lot. I have been postponing the notion to buy it for a long time and now that I have I am satisfied with how the game plays and how it looks and again its story. It is not something I would necessarily go out of my way and to buy again let's say at full price because it's a type of game that except the story and the action found contained within the story I do not necessarily like in terms of let's say the skill aspect where in a PvP; Player versus Player environment I am kind of not interested in competing but with emphasis on competition and the fact to really get some skills you have to learn them first which isn't a huge problem the issue with me is that to get good at a game let's say in an online environment one has to develop like let's say create and sharpen and maintain those skills in which sense I'd rather play 100 games than just simply get really good at one.  Even though this has happened in the past, that I've dedicated myself to one particular game for a long period of time and had even gotten good at it, let's say that age and slowly but surely growing older does not help in this regard of like being able to achieve what once was possible even though I do not speak for everyone when I say this but somewhere in between there lies a truth.

A truth that goes something along the lines of;
I'd rather have thick plot armor than a poor experience online, by which I do not hint at my own skills and the willingness to use them but rather I'd fight in a Co-Op with my brothers against the big bad (that's like powered by an AI of sorts or just a CPU) rather than fighting against them. Against Us. Also fact that sometimes cheaters can ruin the fun (not commenting on Titanfall multiplayer which I know or just assume that a lot of people are a fan of but rather: speaking in general terms) is something I am not so much willing to deal with too much ""these days"" or since they kind of swarmed the online games, but that's something for another time...

Anyway, I am and still will remain more of a fan of tactical first or even third person shooters and most of all: immersive sims but I think that a few aspects of those things in this game, despite its fast pace can be somewhat found and this is why I do like the game contextually, thematically and as well aesthetically and I would recommend it to other players to jump into it and play at least the single player component because it is pleasing and fun.

Don't get me wrong the gameplay is fantastic, but there's just something off with it. The ttk is very low but respawns are very fast so it balances out a bit. Maps feel a bit too funneled with how you spawn in basically the same area you died 4/5 times. Some weapons/titans feel like they do a million damage to everything while others seem to just be wet cardboard sticks. But all of those are just nitpicks.

The main reason for me putting down this game and not trying to get better at it is that the game doesn't tell me if I did good or not. Even games like Squad that are mil-sims without scoreboards still tell me how many times I died at the end of the match. Titanfall 2 does not do that, instead it tells you how many pilots and npcs you killed and you have to infer how many times you died based on that relation to other people. But as a gamer, I understand that I could have 10,000 kills but if I died 1,000,000 times getting them it wasn't worth it. How am I, as a person who enjoys competition in my multiplayer competitive games, expected to improve on myself when all you give me is a kill count? The human mind is notoriously faulty, how do you expect me to remember and reflect on every death I had in a game centered around being even faster paced then CoD? It's quite frankly ridiculous in this era of esports launching with every popular game to not at least acknowledge what is typically the most dedicated type of player. This lack of foresight is, in my opinion, the primary reason this game is not more popular. Why would I wan't to play a first-person shooter where I'm not even rewarded for doing well and we all get participation trophies?

This game is lackluster in general, but it's already dead and typically like 5 bucks on sale so go ahead and buy it.

ALSO, the game is horrendously monetized I'm pretty sure I saw multiple skins being sold for $5 (the price of the game) but to be fair I don't think there were any pay to win mechanics.

Also, why would you add severe bullet travel time to the sniper in a game where everyone never stops moving at 100000 miles an hour and in order to use it you have to stop moving in which case you almost always immediately die.

Some of these dev decisions are just weird.",1708279257,1708279936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* a wonderful 5h-ish singleplayer campaign with feels
* active multiplayer PvP and PvE
* insane fluid movement
* great feeling weapons
* TITANS, the gigantic mechs Apex Legends (which is in titanfall's universe) doesn't have, with additional ultimate mechanic
* weapon and titan customization offering diverse gameplay styles
Get it on sale - it goes on sale with every Steam sale, but even at full price it's worth it. Respawn fixed the hacker/ddos problem which was plaguing titanfall 2 for years, making the game playable again around Fall 2023. The game was so good that even when the original client was suffering, people made Northstar client to be able to play - this says something about how good the game is that even 3rd party solutions were made to keep it alive.
A big thumbs up, it's worth for the singleplayer campaign alone, which is one of the better stories told in fps games. But try multiplayer too, if you like fast paced combat and cutthroat no hands holding PvP, you won't be dissapointed. You can trap enemy pilots in a gravity grenade and then shoot them, you can step on them or meelee them with your titan, you can perform executions on titans and pilots or you can rodeo a pesky titan and steal its battery or throw a grenade into its hatch, the weapons range from hitscan to relatively slow moving balls of hate. There's lot to uncover and explore wrt mechanic, and campaign has a replayability value in the form of hidden collectibles, and speedrun community which gatered around this game (search YT for ""titanfall speedrun"" but AFTER you do the singleplayer campaign, because spoilers). I love this game and I have over 300hrs in it now on Origin/EAApp, but recently I transferred over to steam to be able to change game language. EA being EA region-locked the game language to PL/RU where I live and when I made a bad decision to give them more money and purchase deluxe edition (some weapon and titan skins) it re-locked itself (I had international key before). Luckily, steam purchase solved that and now I have intl. version with Polish included. Thanks GabeN ♥",1708278354,1708278354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a pilot you are incredibly nimble and can traverse terrain with ease. As a mech you become a war machine with massive presence and an immense firepower to unleash against your targets.
The wall running was a bit tricky to get used to at first, but playing the campaign really helped me understand the wall jump. My main gripe with this game is the lack of customization, but I understand that this is an older game and Respawn is focusing on Apex. I do wish they would put more love back into this franchise, I would certainly buy Titanfall 3 if it ever came out.
Overall wonderful game. Absolutely recommend. Multiplayer lobbies are still alive and well with many game modes. Since picking up this game a few weeks ago que times have been about 2 minutes or so.

Campaign with its gimmicks was a nice addition compared to the first game, however the game was heavily downgraded compared to original by getting rid of core design ideas such as multiplayer campaign, cutscenes, soundtrack, grounded design, titan rodeo, grunts cinematic presence on a level with various voice lines, actions and animations as well as first person executions and animations that really immersed you in the first title. While Titanfall 2 should have been excelled at fixing what Titanfall 1 had issues with, it instead took major step back while adding ever more modern gimmicks such as grappling hook.

The voice acting is spectacular and really makes you CARE about the characters, something many other games fall short of reaching, the gameplay is just as good, with many guns, abilities, etc., that add both enjoyment and variety to the game. Definitely worth the very cheap pricepoint(not to mention that it often goes on sale for $3.). Despite the praise, however, I do have some problems, mainly the fact that Titanfall as a whole has been pretty much abandoned by EA and Respawn in favor of Apex Legends, though I hear of rumors of a third game? Perhaps. The visuals do get a little boring at some points, and there are several parts that aren't as realistic as I'd like(looking at you, radiation room that you ""can't stay in for too long"" that you can actually stay in for forever in The Beacon... also the part where BT grabs you in the SAME LEVEL after falling from at LEAST 50 meters up, MORE than enough to kill a person), but overall, those experiences barely drag down the better parts of the game.

Online appears to be working again. 



[b]PRE-EDIT:[/b]

Review before DDOS --->

I initially bought this because I like the idea of mech suit sci-fi games. The multiplayer is probably one of the more interesting experiences you will have in an FPS game. Hopefully I will come back to this review with more detail when I have time and think of new things to say. Frankly, I'd just rather play more Titanfall 2 than write this review, but these things need to be said. This game is criminally underrated, but has a strong and growing fanbase as recently as January 2021.



[b]Story mode[/b] -  [9/10]

Very original for a video game about mech suits. Beautiful story. Smooth game mechanics. Variety of challenges, despite linearity. Multiple difficulty settings for both die hards and beginners. Objectives are clear, but not spoonfed to you (except at the very beginning with the tutorial). The whole game feels fresh and exciting throughout, even on multiple replays (hard to even identify a specific gameplay loop for single player mode, which is a good thing). 


[b]Multiplayer[/b] - [8/10]  SEE EDIT --> I've since changed the rating to [9/10]

Great, but sometimes hard to find games since it isn't the most recent game around. Works faster if you join a network then invite players from that network to join your party. If you queue up 1 or 2 game modes and disable the rest, it will find matches faster (especially Attrition mode).

EDIT: VERY AWESOME once you find people to play with and also start to take advantage of the 'Invite Network' function, which results in faster matches and less waiting. On the whole, very friendly community. There are however a few bad apples who are toxic. My favorite way to play is with friends using mics on Discord (although there is in-game push-to-talk in TF2). Changing my rating for multiplayer from [8/10] to [9/10]. 



[b]Graphics/Software/Hardware[/b] - [9.5/10]

Still looks current in 2020, which is really saying something considering it came out in 2016. Beautiful game, great frame rates, and wonderful graphics. 

Game does crash occasionally and can be occasionally finicky with the window settings, however it still runs very well. 

I run the game at a VERY steady 75 FPS on a 75 Hz monitor with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (definitely not a top tier graphics card) at max graphic settings. Before, I was running it with 120 FPS (with only occasional frame drops) on a 60 Hz monitor, but it got harder to do once I started playing online (even with some overclocking). A decent internet connection speed (whatever this means to you) is definitely recommended for online play. 



[b]Replay value[/b] - [8.5/10]

Story mode is very linear; however if you enjoy the multiplayer, you can get hours and hours out of this game. I didn't even really play FPS games online before this and I've managed to put in over 200 hours now. 


[b]Weapons/loadouts[/b] - [9/10]

So many unique and functional weapons for a variety of styles of play. It's great. I like to use 
cloak, EPG, MGL, and Legion Titan (Predator cannon, which is essentially a gatling-style minigun/rotary machine gun). So many different combinations to fit your style of play.

I have mixed feelings with this one but can't deny that the campaign was short but sweet and pretty awesome - and for £2.49 (what I paid for it), I definitely got my money's worth. 

I'm just disappointed that the campaign was so short and one sided. You only get to play as the Militia (rebel scum) /yawn. Now if there had to been another 6 hour campaign included where you play as the IMC then it'd be a 10/10 (like the first Titanfall). 

It seems most of the dev time/effort went into the multiplayer and cash shop (paid skins, microtransactions). 

There is also a co-op [i] defence [/i] mode but I haven't tested that or the multiplayer yet. I fear I'll drown in sweat and become lost in a jungle of neckbeard - judging by some of the negative reviews, I'm right in thinking that. 

I already can tell it's not going to be as good as TF1's multiplayer (or the game in general) - I prefer it's simplicity. Here there's funky weapon/armour/titan skins and microtransactions and just too much going on (that's just from looking at the loadouts). I haven't seen any pink Titan skins at least. There's quite a few game modes though which is cool like capture the flag or a mode where it's just pilots vs pilots (no Titans) or one where everyone starts in a Titan - at least there's options and it seems easy enough to choose what you want to participate in.

Also a pet peeve - it's no longer simple IMC vs Militia. Dumb is what it is.

But as for the single player campaign... 

The combat is fast paced and satisfying as are the weapons - it's fluid and at least for me feels natural. It didn't take long to get into the swing of things, although I did play many, many hours of the first Titanfall back in the day so maybe some of it's from memory. 

There's a nice balance between pilot (on-foot) and Titan gameplay and 
the interaction/dialogue/relationship between them is wholesome. 

There is at least one returning character ""Blisk"" who was basically your commander during the IMC campaign in the first Titanfall and there are small references to Demeter which I thought was cool. 

There's a handful of boss fights throughout the game and each one is unique.

There's some annoying enemies that can one shot you and can I just say, fuck those fucking ticks, man.

A decent amount of variety in all areas of the game. 

Overall, I enjoyed it enough to play it all in one sitting and if I can squeeze some entertainment out of the online portion then well, value for money +1000%. If not, I still got my money's worth. 

Ultimately though, I feel more comfortable Not Recommending it for some of
the reason above... Plus, it's EA we're talking about. Nothing good comes from that.
There's microtransactions and only a 6-hr campaign because most dev time went into
making weapon skins. EA's fault most likely. = 🖕It's obvious that most of the effort 
was put into the online making skins and microtransactions. If that effort had been put 
to the single player, we could've got another 6 hour campaign. Perhaps one for us IMC 
bros. But greed always wins. Think about that. Overwhelmingly (positive) overrated 
more like. 

Balance must be restored so this is me doing my part by Not Recommending this.

Single player campaign: Rare to see a good FPS campaign these days, it's basically a 6 hour tutorial combined with excellent storytelling/lore. Most players will appreciate the slow learning curve and will have more confidence into playing against other real players online with their new set of parkour and titan handling skills. 

Multiplayer: Only played a few games but I know it’s going to be hectic, this game was released a while ago so that means evil EA didn’t ruin it with loot boxes or nasty micro transactions to hinder player progress like their other games…
One thing I like is that the game still rewards you when you lose so players could still have fun and progress even if you keep getting destroyed.

Buy this game if you love:
-Bad ass looking titans
-A single player experience you will never forget  
-Fun Futuristic weapons and gadgets
-Free movement in the battlefield or smooth parkour systems
-Customisation of everything you could think off by just playing the game.

The campaign took me around 6 hours to complete. The story, when boiled down, is kind of generic with its plot themes, but the immersive and vibrant world of Titanfall really helps to make it feel unique.
The multiplayer is where Titanfall's movement and combat set it apart from other games. The movement is sublime, and the combat feels great. Unfortunately, there are a small list of gripes I have with the multiplayer. I don't find the progression system to be that good, especially when talking about primary weapons. All weapons, to my knowledge, get the same unlocks and in the same order. I wish there was more variety when it came to that. Also, as fun as the multiplayer is, it gets repetitive very quickly if you don't switch up gamemodes. It seems like everybody plays Attrition all day. My final gripe is that everyone has a bright red outline over their character to improve visibility during the fast paced and hectic action. Yeah, it makes target acquisition easy, but it lowers the skill ceiling.

I'll just be covering the Campaign for this review by the way. You play as SRS Rifleman Jack Cooper, who is in training to become a Pilot, a super soldier with all the best qualities, including a Titan - A 25 foot tall heap of metal with state of the art weaponry and AI. When things go awry with your Mentor, Captain Tai Lastimosa, your job is to pick up the mantle of Pilot and save the world. With your Titan, BT-7274, you make your way through battlefields and different lands, trying to disable a weapon of mass destruction. 

I absolutely adore Titanfall 2. There aren't a lot of games that genuinely make me feel flurries of sadness, anger and happiness quite like this game. If you haven't gotten this game, please, please do pick it up. You won't regret it.

  Despite the fact that the game is too short, it is a masterpiece. The graphics are stunning even for today, the story amazing and it's one of the greatest games I've ever played.

  I've bought it at an great deal, not being sure if I'd play it, I've seen ""robots"" and I was like ""nah, not my type of game"", so if u think this game is not for your taste, believe me, it's worth every penny and second.

   I've seen players complaining about graphical bugs and problems/poor performance on high end GPUs, there may be minor bugs, but not noticeable, also the performance for me was like constant 140-170fps on max settings with my RTX3070.

   Also I'm sad that the developers launched Apex Legends and we can't be sure if there will be an Titanfall 3. 😭

Titanfall 2 is fast-paced FPS where you parkour around so that you don't get shot.  Both you and the soldiers you face are squishy and heavily armed.  But you're faster!

The titan-fighting is also cool, with some dodging - but the titans are a little less quick in that respect.  But they make up for it in cool weapons and abilities.

Titanfall 2 is my favorite game of all time, and holds up really, really well, even 7 years after its first release in 2016, and can still go toe-to-toe with the most modern titles in my opinion. For a game published by EA, there is a massive lack of micro transactions, with the only real ones being the Monarch's Reign DLC (which, comes with the Ultimate Edition, which is the only one you can buy now), and some skins in the shop, and prime titans, which are very out of the way and unobtrusive. Titanfall 2 was abandoned for a little while, however it seems that Respawn is coming back to it, and is even teasing a 3rd installment, which would most likely be revealed at The Game Awards. The multiplayer is amazing, there are still thousands of people playing, and the community, which is often overlooked in many games, is absolutely amazing. The campaign is probably one of the best ones to come out in recent memory. While short, it is still one of the most fun experiences I have had in a game. 

TL;DR, Titanfall 2's community, campaign, and multiplayer are all awesome. Now go play it.

The balance of pilot / titan combat is just perfect: the fast, parkour-like freedom of movement of the fragile pilots carrying relatively weak weapons contrasts with large, powerful, but slower and less manoeuvrable robots with specialised weapon loadouts.

Not only do you get the contrast between the two modes within the same game, you get a wildly different experience depending on which combinations of pilot and titan loadout you use. Although you're likely to settle on your favourite titans and pilot loadouts, one of the best features of this game is that you can have tons of fun just trying something different out for a game or two. Some of the most fun games I've played have been the ones where I'm the lowest-scoring member of the losing team.

The single-player campaign is excellent too, a combination of excellent story-telling and tutorial for the main game mechanics you'll need in multiplayer.

I give up. There's no way to build enough skill, No amount of practice that will let me enjoy the game anymore.
EA doesn't want you to play it
the game design itself doesn't want you to play it.
Don't play it.

For both Titans and Pilot weapons, there is a clear choice that is just better in almost every situation, leaving the variety and fun of the game up to however you decide to play. Luckily, most players tend to play the more enjoyable Titans and pick the less OP weapons, so this unbalance in the game isn't always a problem that you will feel.
  
The most fun in this game comes from its community content on the community run Northstar servers, so if you buy this game be sure to go check those out here: [url=https://northstar.tf/] https://northstar.tf/ [/url]   
  
Besides the multiplayer, the campaign is extremely well made, and if you enjoy things like speedrunning, it is an absolute treat.

But the multiplayer is so incredibly frustrating sometimes.

When its good, its so incredibly addicting.  I've burned entire days away playing this game, both singleplayer and multiplayer.  The rush of taking down a titan, obliterating armies of ai grunts, or pulling off crazy acrobatics to kill an enemy pilot that clearly had the drop on you.  As much as Blisk might try to drill into your head that you shouldn't try to be a hero, you certainly feel like one or at the very least a badass.

But lately I've noticed a change, which unfortunately follows right on the tails of the community becoming revived.  

Approximately 10% of my shots simply do not connect when they should have.  This is pretty much inconsequential when running smgs or anything that goes brr and sprays pilots to death.  However, if you find yourself in a long term relationship with a G2 or any other weapon that requires a few extra clicks its painfully apparent.  I've gotten into melee fights where it seems as though we kicked at the same but my opponent ends up unscathed.  I would go and watch the kill cam and its revealed that i never kicked at all.  I check my ping and its sitting pretty at 50-60 ms.

Spawn killing is an inherent core multiplayer experience.  Once you have the enemy on their heels, you can just keep rotating around the map in your titan gang beating the snot out of pilots who spawned seconds earlier. 

There are chat spam bots who read like if you fed chatgpt nothing but mw2 lobby transcriptions.  They're ""harmless"" as one veteran pointed out, but annoying nonetheless. 

Overall, I wish there was a point system for steam store, because its not a bad game in the slightest.  I would give it a 7/10 but wouldn't necessarily recommend it for anyone who isn't already playing.",1705951133,1705951133,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b] Rating: 9.0/10.0[/b]

Summary: I think Titanfall ® 2 is a good game, probably legitimately a great game, but was released in Q3 2016 when it competed with other good games at the time like Call Of Duty. It's a game where you take the role of cooper, a pilot of arobot warrior called Titan. I did not play the first in the series, by the way. I do not remember it being a huge hit. Rumors say it was a multiplayer focused game. But I experienced Titanfall 2 to be a polished game with a solid single player campaign. It was smooth, and featured mechanics rarely seen in other games, like switching between humans and robots, as well as acrobatics and time travel mechanics combined, which makes for a refreshing change. It seems to have a solid multiplayer base, but I have not tried it. Will there be a Titanfall 3? It deserves it.

 

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Acrobatics are fun in that there's wall running, but what makes this a one-of-a-kind experience is when you combine it with time travel.
[*] Fights against other Titans especially are epic, and feels like a Call of Duty in the Titanfall world. 
[*] Interesting storyline, where one might care enough once you get past the more boring and normal parts of the first 1 hour or so.
[*] There is a wide variety of weapons and Titan upgrades which looks like class changes. 
[*] Good list of bosses with interesting characters.
[*] A bit of a touching story, not sure why but it seems more engaging than most others.
[*] This game doesn't need a wiki. It's pretty much self explanatory unless you want to collect items. The simplicity is good when you are looking for simple, fast action games. 
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] First hour or so looks mundane, like a normal shooter.
[*] Not really a con, but less interesting mechanics of robots when compared to Mechwarrior. Different concept though, and may depend on taste.

I've heard how good this game is and how so many people want a 3rd one, and it's been in my wishlist for like 2 years now and I've seen it on sale for 5 dollars so many times now, but I only now bought it. I played this game knowing almost nothing about it besides the fact that you have a friend robot (which should've made me play even sooner considering I adore robot characters in games and media, but for some reason I still didn't). What I got, was an amazing story game with *insanely* cool gameplay mechanics that I wasn't expecting (there seriously was a moment where I got to one section of the game where you teleport between 2 different time frames and I was like ""woah, this is cool."" and had to stop for a minute cause I just thought it was so cool). and an amazing friendship between the main character and BT (the robot). I loved every second of this game and was so distraught when it ended cause I wanted it to be so much longer. I beat the game in a single play through and then went back and got all of the collectibles and actually 100%-ed the game just because I wanted more. I plan on coming back again sometime in the future just to play it again after it feels fresh to me. 

It's rare to find shooter games with good unique gameplay AND a good story (...Newer CoD...) so this one was a treat.

It released several years ago but still holds up to today standards,it's a shame the multiplayer servers doesn't work anymore but it gave me something in return so i can close my eyes and ignore that.
It gave me one of the best single player experience i had in the last years.

With almost perfect level design and a stellar modified valve-source engine delivers a stunning visual experience. 
The game looks good from any angle,and it's a rare gem that looks good and feel smooth too!
There's parts of the game where you need to take enemies on your own where i enjoyed the gunplay a lot,headshots felt so rewarding,wall jumps,melee attacks,trowing grenades while wall-running.

Titans on the other hand comes with superior firepower,less mobility and superior protection.
The game features a linear story but with multiple paths you can choose to explore,
the parkour element is fun and well made.

The game story is decent with great moments,i must say emotional at times. I know there's a huge robot made of metal involved,how can it be? 

The friendship between human and machine ,a bond that grows stronger
and builds in time with every mission..it felt incredible,so enjoyable! 

For me it's one of the most underrated games, one of the best on steam!

Pros:

-Smooth gameplay,fun gunplay
-Good graphics even in 2024
-Good story,solid single player experience

Cons:

-no multiplayer servers

Meh.

If you get it for about 5$ then it's a reasonably good deal.

If you are looking for an intricate and deep shooter that rewards your aiming skill, that's not it. If you are looking for a Michael Bay movie mixed with the ulltimate power fantasy transformed into a shooting game with robots, that is it.

My biggest problem with this game is that I don't personnaly like power fantasy, I prefer deeper story. The main character if so FULL of plot armor, shonen protagonist would be jealous of him. I don't win fights or accomplish things because I am good at the game, I succeed because the main character is meant to win against impossible odds. You can fight army 100 times bigger than yours, just press left click and win.

The shooting, and especially the feel of many of these weapons is on par with some of my favorite shooter. The parkour is fine, the sliding is good. The mech fights, are in my opinion, boring, they are incredibly over the top, but not as deep and intricate as the shooting. 
The story is mediocre. It's the most american thing I have seen in a while. There's no great character, the voice acting is alright, the writing is poor and the pacing...
The game has a great tutorial though, I am not talking about the ghost thing at the beginning, I am talking about the first level, which slowly introduces mechanics in increasing level of complexity, which is nice.
Also, it has so many flaws, no audio mixing (I hate BT repeatedly saying I am fighting titans, when I am next to him shooting at said titan, and would've prefer to shut off dialogue volume), no option to hold to run (c'mon, now). The game crashed while opening maybe 5/6 times, and that's considering the fact that I beat the game in two sessions. Also, SO many loading screens, even inside levels, which aren't too long.

The ability to easily wall run, double jump and climb up on ledges, all while constantly on the run, gives Titanfall a breakneck pace and fluidity that has yet to be topped. Though the Call of Duty series can’t quite match the sense of speed and agility that Titanfall seems to achieve so effortlessly.

This parkour-style movement works so well in Titanfall 2 because its levels are designed to take advantage of it. Nowhere is this more evident than in Titanfall 2’s single player campaign, where the mastery of double jumping and wall running will be crucial to your success.

In Titanfall 2’s story campaign, you play Jack Cooper, a rifleman in the Militia who dreams of becoming a pilot. Jack’s dreams become true sooner than expected when an IMC attack forces his mortally-wounded mentor to transfer ownership of his Titan, named BT, over to him. Thrust into the war, the new pilot and his Titan quickly develop a bond that carries them through this violent conflict.

At first glance, the storyline in Titanfall 2 resembles the kind of generic sci-fi premise that you’d expect to see. While the story itself is far from original, the game’s humour and the unlikely friendship that grows between Jack and BT elevates the story mode into something that’s truly rewarding. You quickly believe that these characters really care for each other, which is repeatedly demonstrated by their actions throughout the campaign. In many ways, the relationship 

By now, you may have heard some comparisons to Half Life 2 thrown around in regards to Titanfall 2’s campaign, and for once, this correlation is justified. The most surprising aspect about the game’s story mode is that it manages to switch up its gameplay entirely on a level-to-level basis. Each mission, a new device or mechanic is introduced which forces you to change your approach to battles and traversal. Because of this, the campaign in Titanfall 2 never once grows stale. 

While the core gameplay ratio remains the same throughout, switching things up between on-foot and Titan-focused battles, these sections change drastically when new mechanics are introduced, such as when time manipulation or wall placement is factored in. One level sees you flipping between past and present versions of the same facility. Depending on the timeframe you’re currently in, the ground or certain walls or doors may or may not be there, and harmless scientists may be replaced by violent enemies. You’ll have to keep your wits and reflexes sharp in order to make it through. It’s one of the more refreshing first person gaming experiences in a long while, recalling the likes of Portal in its clever design. 

Titanfall 2 also has a lot of Titan vs Titan boss battles throughout its campaign. Thankfully these bosses, which are almost always voiced in an over-the-top and stereotypical way, never feel overpowered. While you may die several times while taking them on, their defeat always feels achievable. Best of all, the many Titan skirmishes that occur throughout the campaign also allow you to polish your skills for multiplayer.

During Titanfall 2’s multiplayer beta, there was a lot of fan outcry calling it a step backwards, with many feeling it took too long for the losing team to be given access to Titan drops, among other balancing qualms. Others complained about the game making players choose between a sidearm and Anti-Titan weapon (a horribly unfair decision to make, given the popularity of the game’s Smart Pistol). There are also the issues of reduced pilot mobility, the lack of Attrition mode and bots were also removed from matches, making it harder for players to rack up points.

Thankfully, many of these issues have already been addressed for the game’s final release, though some are still unresolved. Attrition mode is back, player and Titan mobility has been increased, and Titan drops now happen quicker, thanks to a change which sees players receiving a small passive amount of Titan meter every few seconds. Meanwhile, the HUD has been improved, and bots are available in certain modes such as the new addition Bounty Hunt.

Along the aforementioned modes, players can also compete in Mixtape, which constantly changes modes with each game; Amped Hardpoint, which has you stealing and protecting bases; Pilots vs. Pilots; 8v8 Mixtape; Last Titan Standing; Coliseum, Capture the Flag and Free for All.

Though some issues from the tech beta still remain, Titanfall 2’s multiplayer remains fun and addictive. There’s no season pass either, meaning every player is given access to any new map, weapon or mode for the life of the game.",1705284220,1705284442,True,88,2,0.823779761791229248,0,True,False,False

This causes newer players to leave and veterans just trying to have fun with different titan/ weapon/ ability combinations to get frustrated. Some servers are much more balanced than others. Singapore, Tokyo and most European servers feel good to play on. I can't tell about US ones but Hong Kong is the absolute worst experience probably in any game where everyone runs CAR smg, spitfire, grenade spam, stim, cloak, tone, monarch, and brainless laser shoot ions. They basically use everything that is overpowered and not balanced in the game and just give their all to win matches in an 8 year old casual game with no real matchmaking (sbmm/ mmr) and a dwindling player-base. Titanfall 2 at its core is an FPS meant to be played casually and to have fun with the perfect movement, gunplay and just experiencing the variety of classes, factions, guns, and titans. Servers and matches where people understand that make this game amazing and satisfying to get on and get off. Modern games tend to make you frustrated and increase anxiety levels at the end of a session, mostly due to the overly competitive and toxic nature of PVP games nowadays.

Lots of fun gamemodes including a PVE tower defense option. I've been playing since the beta on PS4 and just recently switched over to PC and it remains one of my all time favorites. The movement is so fluid and both titans and pilots feel fantastic despite how different their respective playstyles are. 

The multiplayer is a little intimidating for newer players but if you spend some time in campaign getting used to the movement, shooting mechanics, and abilities it becomes a lot more enjoyable. There's a very rewarding skill curve to climb that makes you feel like you're always learning and improving while still keeping things relatively balanced with other players. You will get destroyed some, but there will also be plenty of moments that make you feel godlike. I cannot sing this game's praises enough.

My only complaint is that I wish the developer would throw some more resources at it. Official servers were down for a while due to DDOS attacks and you still run into trolls and hackers every once in a while. The community has held strong and while there's definitely a competitive streak, it's a pretty supportive and fun group overall. 

This is the pinnacle of multiplayer shooters and it's hard to even imagine how a studio could top this. I hope to spend many more matches fighting for the frontier!",1705006675,1705006675,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Movement is great, weapons are great, everything!!!
Unique mechanics, controlling a Titan with my keyboard and mouse feels really immersive, especially on my UW monitor.
Boss designs are really cool but I found them a bit easy on Hard (I already have pretty good experience in FPS games).
The story keeps you hooked and you may play trough the game in 1-2 sittings like I did.

I will try multiplayer now and may try collecting all achievements in the future...

From its breakneck-paced gameplay to its compelling characters, Respawn Entertainment has truly crafted a gem that stands tall in the world of gaming. 

The heart and soul of Titanfall 2 lie in its characters, and none shine brighter than the indomitable BT-7274. The bond formed between the protagonist, Jack Cooper, and his Titan is nothing short of extraordinary. BT's stoic yet endearing personality elevates the narrative, turning what might seem like a conventional story into a heartwarming journey. The emotional depth achieved in the relationship between Jack and BT adds layers to the plot, transforming what may appear initially bland into a rich and engaging narrative. 

Speaking of gameplay, Titanfall 2 doesn't just meet expectations; it shatters them. The fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled action is a breath of fresh air in a genre. The fluidity of movement, the seamless transition between on-foot and Titan combat, and the sheer intensity of battles create an experience that is both challenging and immensely enjoyable. 

The multiplayer component of Titanfall 2 is a true standout, offering an addictive and entertaining experience whether you're flying solo or teaming up with friends. The diverse range of maps, the strategic depth of Titan combat, and the variety of game modes ensure that each match feels fresh and exciting.

In conclusion, Titanfall 2 is a triumph in every sense of the word. It seamlessly blends intense gameplay with a touching narrative, and the characters, especially BT, leave an indelible mark on players. Respawn Entertainment has not only delivered a stellar sequel but has set a new standard for what a first-person shooter can achieve. Titanfall 2 is a must-play for anyone seeking an adrenaline-pumping, emotionally resonant gaming experience.

You will still hit your shots going eleven miles per octosecond, and adrenaline is always guaranteed for every match, as standing still or even just moving slightly leisurely means death, no ifs, no buts. Every weapon feels reliable, and this is the only game where the sniper is not annoying to play against, which is due to the schmooves you can pull off. So you will not get sniped across the map unless the player has the actual skill to pull it off.

The campaign story itself is nothing special; what (at least for me) made the narrative compelling was the characters of BT (your titan) and Jack Cooper (the player) and how they grow a strong bond between each other. Also, BT is funny and adorable at the same time. Although I like Blisk as the villain (mostly because I love JB Blanc), he is not super memorable, as goes for the rest of the cast. Okay, Viper is pretty rad, but that is only because of his Titan design! Lastly, the soundtrack is unforgettable; there is nothing catchy. This does not make the game worse or bad; it just could have been much better. I will say that the composer, Stephen Barton, clearly improved, as the Apex Legends main theme is pretty good and has a memorable beat.

Either way, this game rules! If you are into fast-paced games, and especially movement shooters, this is a no-brainer. A campaign with a good narrative combined with great multiplayer for 30 euros is an absolute steal. As BT would say, ""trust me.""",1672966992,1704498442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there's no real matchmaking for newer players, they casually drop fresh installs in with people who've played for hundreds if not thousands of hours. dropping players into the deep end will force players to learn quick yet it can also make them leave just as quickly and be seen as being not ''noob friendly'' just like TF2... The one by valve. (but that one's determined by the server you join so eh)

First time playing the campaign. It was really, really great. Most fun I had in a FPS in a long time since Halo! 

Music, dialogue, gameplay, level design were all A-tier. It took me around 6-7 hours to finish. It didn't overstay it's welcome, yet I want MORE!

It's a shame EA will probably force Respawn to exclusively work on Apex for the forseeable future. I could definitely see this being a massive franchise with amazing campaigns AND multiplayer. Something to rival CoD and Halo. (just not released every year like CoD, for obvious reasons)

Would chose him over my car.. imagine you're caught up in a traffic jam ^^ Somehow some scenes reminded me of that Short Circuit moment, where the robot seems to die and as a kid that just broke my heart lol.

The campaign is incredible. Even today. As often mentioned in other comments it's fast & fun no matter if you run or go by titan. Leveldesign (I'm not talking about textures and models here) is amazing! So many changes within the same levels.. Gunplay is fun and responsive (guess they took this game as base for apex in gameplay and storyissues) and it looks just great.
The multiplayer on the other hand is basically dope too. IF it works. Servers had been down 2 times (like several months! not hours) So if there was a huge mainbase it's lost meanwhile. 
But what I experienced in the last weeks was that the multiplayer is running again. You just have to accept that the playercount is low and many players are from the 1st gen.

I didn't try it when it was new bc the advanced movement seemed like it would be over my head. Still, I followed the TF|2 news and the hacker drama. I picked this up in October (2023) after hearing that the vanilla servers were miraculously and suddenly returned to life.

I was a fool for waiting almost seven years.

I was legitimately addicted to this game for the entirety of that first month. The campaign slaps. The gameplay is solid, polished, and feels oh so good. And the balance - while not perfect - is held to higher standards than the vast majority of the competition. 

...just don't expect to immediately rip-and-tear in online lobbies. The dedicated fanbase has a little bit (many, many years) more experience than us newbies, and that tends to stack up exponentially in advanced movement shooters. Play the campaign. Get comfortable with wall-running. Don't be afraid to fail. And don't be afraid to ask for tips. The majority of the playerbase is really friendly, and there's a good amount of videos online that are still up-to-date even if they're several years old. 

So standby for Titanfall, and get ready to cope about the Titanfall 3 release schedule with the rest of us.",1704168258,1704168258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Of course you'll get mopped the floor with by those who've got hundreds of hours more game time under their belt but it's great when you notice how your movement is getting better and you're getting more and more kills. 

In multiplayer, you won't have trouble finding matches. The queuing time for a match depends but usually it's less than two minutes to find one.  I can honestly see myself playing Titanfall 2 for hundreds of hours. If you've ever played Apex Legends, you'll recognize the weapons and the mechanics even. I've got about 500 hours in Apex Legends but I honestly can't say I'll go back to Apex Legends after getting to know Titanfall. You can lay back and relax and chill and have fun in Titanfall without all the raging of the Apex Legends.

It's got everything you could want from a shooter game. 

- Excellent movement, and it's not hard to catch on the basics.
- Cool arsenal consisting of many unique weapons, such as the Cold War, that shoots a 4-round-burst of explosive salvo munition.
- Very good story in the campaign. It makes you feel great and unstopable, but it also builds up to moments where you feel exstatic for surviving set x y z against all odds. + Amazing music that almost made me cry the first time i played this game.
- Great PvP with multiple gamemodes where you don't have to feel like dying is the end (such as in apex)

I already much prefer this over Apex Legends where i have 7500h played, versus 150 in Titanfall.

It is kind of sad that EA or Respawn has not seen our request to make Titanfall 3, because this game was FANTASTIC.

SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD!

The Idea of having a companion with you in games, is not rare, many games have done that. But, in this game, BT-7274 (Bravo-Tango 7274) is a perfect mix of a friend and a robot.

There are many dialogues that indicate that BT is FAR MORE than a robot. During typical games with robots as companions, the most common play is that the robots are pretty dumb where they do not understand sarcasm. BT, in chapter 1, being the same, with a formal tone, and, not understanding sarcasm, but, as the main Protagonist (Jack Cooper) and BT become close, we can see that BT understands things.

One Crucial moment that I spotted out was in the chapter where we were about to escape with the Arc, but, we got trapped inside the ship which was quickly crashing. In that scene, BT covered Jack with some debris and his own chassis, and, when we asked about what he was doing, he responded with ""Protocol 3: I will not lose another Pilot"". Anyone familiar with the game will remember that Protocol 3 was ""Protect the Pilot"", not, ""I will not lose another pilot"". This clearly shows that the story writers have put a lot of effort into BT's Character.

The locations are varied and interesting and there are a good amount of different missions to get through. Some of these focus more on combat, others more on traversal. The best one is the chapter ""Cause and Effect"", which features an unexpected mechanic that makes going through the level a lot of fun. 

Although your Titan (BT) stays the same, there are different types of loadouts you unlock. These change the abilities and weapons of BT and keep the shooting feeling fresh throughout.

Story-wise it's a pretty standard affair, but it is immensely helped by the dynamic between you and BT. There's some fun dialogue and genuinely good moments sprinkled throughout. Even if it’s just for the campaign I’d definitely say it is, without a doubt, worth the discounted asking price. 

The game ran at a consistent 60 fps @ 800p (high settings) on Steam Deck and it looked amazing on the small screen.

As time went on I became much more of a Titanfall fan than Apex and now seeing any hint of Titanfall in Apex cinematics, characters, or trailers is exciting and saddening at the same time:

The story, setting and beauty of Titanfall is captivating and unique. No other game feels quite the same, but the game suffers at  the hand of its own publisher/development team. EA is responsible for the low playerbase of this game, do not take face value numbers as ""this game must be bad because not many people play it"".

The campaign is 10/10 and is awesome to play and help get a feel of the game before launching into PvP. Even if you have played Apex before Titanfall, like me, I would recommend playing the campaign first, as it feels extremely different, but also strangely familiar.",1653376838,1703774573,True,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This is one of those games where it seems to make everything you do feel cool. Because you're playing as a super soldier who can basically fly with the power of wallrunning and grappling hooks, who also has a giant robot buddy who makes you feel like you could take on all the Greek gods after they tricked you into killing your own wife and daughter. The singleplayer campaign is incredibly fun and well designed, and has one of the coolest levels known to gamers in the form of a time jumping mission. The multiplayer modes are super fun and don't require you to sweat out of your eyes to feel like you're doing okay (like in the sister-game Apex Legends), and even the co-op I find to be super satisfying and fun. The original Titanfall had the problem of there not being much progression or unlocks - but that is certainly taken care of in this sequel. Every game it feels like you unlock a new shader for a weapon (to show off your mastery of it) and by extension, new weapons. It simply *feels good* to be playing this game, which is the main thing I look for in a game. The only possible complaint I could have is that at some points it feels like some Titans way outclass others in multiplayer, but shocked as you may be - the whole game doesn't revolve around them. You can play Pilot vs Pilot with no Titanfall, you can play co-op and not have to feel outmatched by the enemy, so on so forth. 10/10 game for me.

Pros

Level design and pacing: ""Titanfall 2"" leverages its dynamic movement mechanics with exceptional level design, offering a diverse range of missions that keep the gameplay fresh and exhilarating. From platforming with time jumping to navigating through a prefabricated houses facility and engaging in intense titan battles, each mission introduces something unique. The variety prevents any sense of repetition, making each mission a joy to experience. The pacing is superb, leaving players eager to discover what comes next.

Combat: The game delivers an outstanding shooter experience, elevated by the exceptional level design. The ability to run on walls and move swiftly to avoid enemy fire adds a layer of intensity to the combat. Hacking robots to fight alongside you, a diverse array of weapons, and challenging enemies contribute to the engaging gameplay. Titan battles are a highlight, offering a satisfying sense of scale and empowerment. The fusion of FPS and platforming elements elevates the combat, setting ""Titanfall 2"" apart in the genre.

Cons

Length: While the brevity of the game, spanning about 6-7 hours, ensures a focused and impactful experience, it leaves players longing for more. The game concludes on a high note, and the desire for additional content is palpable. While repeating the game is an option, the prospect of additional hours of this exhilarating experience would have been a welcome addition. Nevertheless, the quality of the gameplay maintains the game's perfect score.

Summary: ""Titanfall 2"" excels with its exceptional level design, masterful pacing, and immensely enjoyable combat. Despite its relatively short duration, the game delivers an intense and satisfying experience, earning its place as one of the best FPS games in the industry.",1686415833,1703654011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2] ""Titanfall 2"" - An Unforgettable Journey with BT, Your Mechanical Best Friend. [/h2]
[/quote]

[quote]
""Titanfall 2"" stands as a shining gem in the world of first-person shooters, offering a thrilling combination of fast-paced action, inventive gameplay mechanics, and a narrative that tugs at the heartstrings. At the center of this masterpiece is the bond forged with your Titan, BT-7274.

From the moment you first embark on your journey with BT, the connection deepens with every encounter. BT isn't just a machine; he's a companion, a partner in the chaos of war. The moments of banter and camaraderie between Pilot and Titan inject a surprising amount of humanity into the game, making BT more than just a mechanical sidekick.

The gameplay mechanics, seamlessly blending fluid parkour with Titan combat, are a testament to the game's innovation. The level design offers a playground for creativity, whether you're executing gravity-defying stunts as a Pilot or engaging in intense mech battles with enemy Titans.

The narrative, while rooted in sci-fi action, manages to deliver emotional punches that resonate. The dynamic relationship with BT is the emotional core of the story, creating a bond that lingers in the player's memory long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, ""Titanfall 2"" isn't just a game; it's an unforgettable journey where the line between man and machine blurs, and a bond with a Titan becomes a defining element of the experience. Whether you're soaring through the air or engaging in Titan warfare, the game leaves an indelible mark, thanks in no small part to the extraordinary connection with BT.

After hearing so much about the campaign online, I decided to purchase this game for about five dollars on winter sale. Since it gave it me almost twenty hours of action, stunning visuals, and amazing plot just in the campaign,  I could easily say that is one of the best games I've ever played. Everything in it is perfect and people online definitely did not over hype it, which is the case for some other games I've played.

The characters are a whole other thing too. BT is the most personable robot I've ever met, and Jack's voice lines are great, they reflect the situation while also maintaining a sense of humor. The 6-4 crew, even if we only met them for a bit, were a great way to make invading a ship with countless amounts of enemies, just a bit more fun and lighthearted. The boss battles are great and always provided a hit of adrenaline. Plus, the box characters all had different personalities and styles of fighting, that way it didn't get stale. All of the other characters where notable too, I just don't feel like writing it all out.

The missions were astounding as well. They weren't too hard of too easy, and while you could complete them with ease on normal mode, it was more a relaxing playtime rather than something like Only Up, where you contemplate killing yourself over the smallest mistake. My favorite mission had to be the final one, where you witness BT get killed, and then see him reappear just in time for completing your boss fight. While this is a video game, I was still at the verge of tears when BT sacrificed himself for protecting the pilot. The scene before the credits basically summed that up for me. I didn't feel good about BT dying in the end. 

The visuals are also something to be reckoned with. The first hour I played the game, I was just drooling over how good the graphics looked and how they pair so nicely with the plot. Even if the game was made in 2016, I honestly think that it rivals most of the modern hits like Cyberpunk. 

So far, I have absolutely no complaints about the game, and I am exited to try the multiplayer feature. I have heard that its absolute dogshit, but I don't think that that's possible considering how good the rest of the game was. Even if the multiplayer is garbage, I think that Respawn deserves all of the credit that anyone can give them. Great game guys, and I hope we get to find out how that post credits scene might tie into a third game. ;)",1703349556,1703349556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Titanfall 2, developed by Respawn Entertainment, not only stands out as an exceptional first-person shooter but also captivates players with its unexpected and remarkable narrative. Released in 2016, this game takes the Titanfall franchise to new heights, particularly in terms of its gripping and emotionally resonant story.

From the outset, Titanfall 2 distinguishes itself with a unique blend of heart-pounding action and a narrative that delves deep into the bond between a pilot and their Titan. The protagonist, Jack Cooper, finds himself unexpectedly paired with BT-7274, a Vanguard-class Titan, after the original pilot is killed in action. What follows is a rollercoaster of emotions as players navigate a hostile alien planet, facing not only enemy soldiers but also the challenges that arise from the evolving connection between Jack and BT.

The pacing of Titanfall 2's story is impeccable, seamlessly transitioning between intense firefights, parkour-inspired pilot movements, and heartfelt moments between the protagonist and his mechanical companion. The writing is sharp, injecting humor into the dialogue without sacrificing the gravity of the overarching plot. This balance contributes to a narrative that is not only entertaining but also emotionally engaging.

One of the game's strengths lies in its ability to deliver unexpected twists and turns. The story takes players through a diverse range of environments, each with its own set of challenges and surprises. Whether navigating a sprawling manufacturing facility or battling through the interiors of a colossal factory, Titanfall 2 keeps players on the edge of their seats with its constantly evolving gameplay and narrative revelations.

The character development in Titanfall 2 is noteworthy, especially considering the limited screen time for certain characters. BT-7274, in particular, emerges as more than just a machine, displaying a personality and charm that fosters a genuine emotional connection. This emotional resonance extends to the broader narrative, creating a memorable experience that lingers well after the credits roll.

Complementing the stellar storytelling is Titanfall 2's exceptional level design and gameplay mechanics. The game seamlessly integrates Titan combat with nimble pilot movement, providing a dynamic and exhilarating experience. The synergy between the game's mechanics and its narrative enhances the overall immersion, making Titanfall 2 a standout title in the genre.

In conclusion, Titanfall 2 not only surpasses its predecessor in terms of gameplay but also delivers a narrative experience that elevates it to the ranks of gaming masterpieces. The emotional depth, unexpected twists, and impeccable pacing make this game a must-play for both fans of the first-person shooter genre and those seeking a compelling, character-driven story in the realm of futuristic warfare. Respawn Entertainment has truly set a new standard with Titanfall 2, and it remains a shining example of how storytelling can elevate the gaming experience to new heights.",1675046321,1703253161,True,0,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

Giant robots, massive battles, amazing movement options, and a marketing campaign close to the Believe campaign from Halo 3 without the emotional attachment. Absolutely phenomenal. I didnt get to play it. I was a kid with no money, and no way to get the game itself. 

When Titanfall 2 came out - I missed the initial wave of players, I missed out on the launch, I missed out for a long time. 

I purchased it a couple years back just for the campaign and fell in love. I expected a game like this to be dead after 6 years, after seeming abandonment by the developers in favor of a pale imitation that pushes the standard battle royale game mode that so many FPS devs are following these days, and after the rumored Russian hacks. 

To my incredibly pleasant surprise, it was not dead. It was thriving. A welcoming, warm community of all types of people, running along walls, blasting each other to bits, piloting massive robots, and generally just having a wonderful time. 

Titanfall 2 has one of the kindest playerbases I've ever seen in my life - and that's not even the best part of the game. The best part is that it plays so immaculately well. As said by my sister who is a former Quake semi-pro ""these movement options scratch an itch I've not been able to satiate in years."" The gunplay is phenomenal and feels solid. When your shots hit, they HIT, when they don't - you know why.

On top of all of this, TF2's sound design rivals most anything on the market. The sounds of the weapons being incredibly distinct from one another, Titans falling from the sky, ambient noises, footsteps, jetpacks and abilities, Respawn did an amazing job working on this game, and every moment of gameplay is an audio heaven. Speaking of  gameplay - the mechanics that you learn about and have your mind slightly blown (like hacking enemy Specter Squads), and graphics that hold up well enough to this day to not feel dated, game types like Attrition, the distinct change of pace from Pilot to Titan, and the ability to not feel like you're completely out of luck facing enemy Titans from on foot - this entire game is so well made that if you like FPS and you don't have it in your library even these 7 years out from the release, you need to. As soon as you can.

Good game. Not great, but good. Like decent fast-food.
Want something cheap and fun? Well this is it.

This game is pretty much the video game equivalent of a Michael Bay movie:
- the story feels like everything is urgent, yet, doesn't really matter
- an emotional journey of militaristic nonsense
- big robots and explosions
- all that with good music

(I'm not anti Michael Bay, but these are just facts)

It's a fun game.

BUT HERE'S WHAT GREAT ABOUT IT:
- amazing graphics
- yet it's not heavy on the graphics card (great implementation)
- sound effects are very nice
- tends to be very cheap through discounts

WHAT'S NOT GREAT:
- 'EA APP' (formerly Origin) platform
- too much dialogue. We don't care about the story - nor should we. I don't think this is the game for deep lore stuff. It could have been more straight-to-combat oriented.

I'm not anti EA either. I think they deserve more respect than they currently get. I'm quite happy with:
- this title
- NFS (2015)
- Dead Space 3 (original)
- Mirror's Edge Catalyst
- Crysis 2 and 3 (original ones)

Lots of fun stuff that tends to be cheap and lightweight on graphics cards while looking amazing.
From that perspective, EA deserves more respect than Ubisoft.",1702544692,1702544692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back in the day.. one would get a game for: An actually good time and not just to ""kill, time"" 

These developers actually had the dopamine to create a fun shooter with a very engaging story-line, 
BT is the Homie. Instead of dog shit missions like Call Of Duty Vanguard's and stale-dog shit missions until endgame like in the new Tiny Tina Shitlands which only had 2 slightly funny missions about Smurfs and Pinocchio, respectively.

This is my first Mech-type shooter so I can't be an expert on that genre but the ability to pick the Titan class seems to Cater to many types of fellas; or; babes. Maybe serves as a gateway to get deep into the genre. 
Slight FPS real time strategy vibes with the 4-player CO-OP. Thanks for the successful release, 
a gears of war 3 type horde mode would be killer but in making it solo, some might cocoon into a realm of reclusion with loads of black metal and fourlokos to become a habitual player of Darkness II and eventually find that Half-life is free on steam and so is POSTAL the first game, to then get POSTAL 2 when the game is on sale for 0.99 cents until December 18th, 2023 accompanied with a rotten, succulent garnish to the main course with the DLC which is 90% off at .95 cents...

TL:DR, Game Reviewer used a gaming launcher to Project his discomfort for *clueless-ly* dishing out $150+ on Tiny Tina, COD: Vanguard, and the new Saints Row after not gaming for 15 years due to becoming a juvenile drug offender which scarred his ability to get a good job.

While it takes some time to learn the movement system, it's very rewarding. Learning to zoom across the map is really quite a treat. The movement system is deep, but as long as you learn and practice some of the basics, it'll treat you well. 

Thankfully, this game supports a good variety of gamemodes, weapons, tactical abilities, grenades, and Titans. The standard gamemode, Attrition, gives NPC targets that still benefits your teams when killed so that newer and unskilled players can still contribute. However, there's plenty of other gamemodes like CTF, Pilot vs Pilot (just Pilot Gameplay), and even a Co-Op mode called Frontier Defense. 

There are 7 types of primary weapons, with at least 2, at most 4 options for each type, 3 pistols for secondaries, and 4 Anti-Titan weapons (weapons good at, you guessed, dealing with Titans). 7 Titans all with different playstyles and further options to tweak abilities. 7 tactical abilities for 7 distinct playstyles and 6 types of throwable grenades called ordinances as well. You get two other abilities to adjust your Pilot and a customizable Execution animation. Thankfully, you get up to 10 Loadouts to adjust.

There's a lot of customization, and the vast majority of it can be unlocked just for playing. The Steam version comes with the DLC needed to try out all the gameplay aspects, only locking additional weapon, Titan, and Pilot (player character) skin options behind pay walls. 

The campaign is short, but very good. This is a great game to speedrun, but besides that, it's short and sweet. Lots of fun, designed well with both Pilot and Titan movement and combat in mind. The actual plot is... well, it's serviceable, and except for your character and your main companion, no one really gets characterization per se, but that's okay. 

Thankfully, now the game's servers have been fixed and you can play online in a Vanilla state. This game is moddable and there's also the Northstar client if you want to try out mods through that. 

It's a lovely game. If you can get it as a gift or nab it on sale, it's 100% worth your time to check out.",1702358457,1702358457,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still feels great on PC but this entire thing about being required to connect to EA app to play this game is extremely frustrating. long story short Playing multiplayer games with Origin launcher sucks really bad compare to Steam if you are not from america or Europe but running a EA app to play a game that you purchase on Steam is tedious process because simply sometimes EA app would not work. Last night i was logged out of my EA account in the middle of match and after that i logged in again but i couldn't launch T2 anymore even tho EA app is working just fine.

It takes a few rounds for a pro to get their T-legs in a session, and coming back after a break / starting new can feel like riding a bike with the controls reversed, but once you click it's absolutely unlike anything else I've ever played. When you figure out the movement system and how to dodge and weave titans, the shit you can pull off makes any scripted trailer look pathetic and unimaginative by comparison. Thousands of games give you superpowers but TF2, when it's really popping, makes You feel like a genuine badass. Taking out a pilot, diving for a window, dropping a satchel on the ground, sliding out the other side as you turn and pull the remote trigger to watch their friend coming after you explode, before bouncing off of a couple walls, reloading, aggroing an enemy titan which comes at you with a vengeance, sliding over cover above their heads as their rounds explode below you, slipping off the edge, catching just enough air for an Archer to target lock and then three point landing behind them as this monster that could crush you into a fine paste with a single keypress gets pounded from above and detonates, all in a single fluid line of badass movement is just a feeling you can't adequately describe with words. Knowing it's not cos you got the super amazing supergun powerup, but because you as a squishy agile lil bunny were able to outmaneuver something with the firepower to kill a battleship and snatch victory is just unbelievably kickass

Some tips: it's not just about moving fast, it's about moving fast and being able to stick close to cover, as well as having a firm grasp on the tactical situation, where the enemies are, where friendly support is, which terrain you can use to turn the tables, then using your movement skills to flip it on em

If you need to fight titans, the best thing you can do is get as much sideways movement as possible, (not head on / away) and try to only break cover long enough to make your antitian weapons hurt. Also, staying close to the ground or right up in their personal space is surprisingly effective. Once took down a ronin from full health as a pilot entirely in close quartets by making them repeatedly grasp at the air where I'd been a millisecond before. Which rocked.  If you need to go for a head on rodeo, try to do it with as much speed and as close to their legs as possible until the jump at the very last moment (obv blind spots are even better)  b/c 99% of the time they're expecting people to jump up to their mids or tops to rodeo, or to get to cover to use ATs. Use what they expect and subvert


Also if you have server issues, change from bottom left main menu. When too few people are in an area, they get kinda unstable, or struggle to matchmake, but it's really rarely a problem these days (used to be famously bad, fixed now) but even if you have to game a couple continents away my experience is you can still consistently be first if you know what you're doing cos the netcodes pretty good when servers are populated",1702094631,1702094631,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Now multiplayer is great, I only played it on the Xbox because I owned it there first. You feel like the world is your oyster whether your in a titan or not, you can change the entire out come of a game in an instant with amazing movement and a pretty decent selection of fire arms and utility items to keep the fast paced shoot outs very enjoyable.

Now, that's not why were here of course because I'm a single player first type of player, so how's the campaign? Phenomenal. Every level is great, though very straight forward they play to the strength of the movement and gun play allowing you to fully optimize the sandbox to your own benefit. You slowly bond with a robot as tall as a house and that robot then turns people into lasagna for you. Amazing, I love BT and his relationship with Jack because we get to see it play out through the game, not just told about it from prior experiences. 

The guns? They kick, and when 8 guys are running at you full sprint fully equipped to kill you on master and your not worried because you can just bool out and erase anybody and anything in a 5 mile radius because the game just let's you do that. Every weapon is completely usable which is amazing, so many games have guns that do nothing like hitting a guy with a sock n bopper but here? Nah that shot's gonna hit and it's gonna hit hard, even the most basic pistol is completely viable all the way till the end of the game for dealing with infantry and I love it.

Most engagements slowly build to a solid pay off normally ending in a titan fight. Even though the boss is the same they all fight you in different ways leading to a climatic ending because most of the time you can use the same weapons soon after meaning you are the boss. 

The further you get the more desperate the battles become, starting with a simple assault on idf forces gone wrong turning into setting off a super weapon that obliterates the entire planet while the few survivors make it off planet just in the nick of time leaving you with not only a sudden loss but also your greatest accomplishment of saving harmony.

Of course the game isn't perfect, having a titan fall d-day near the end can be horrendously tedious especially on harder difficulties and the final boss is not nearly the hardest. I see that flying titan in my nightmares sometimes just when I think I'm gonna finally free from my internal torment please why is he so hard like my goodness. Also when wall running sometimes your character just gets...stuck in the wall? It happened a few times and resetting the game seems to be the only fix sadly. 

To wrap up, It's simply extremely fun to play. I highly recommend you play if you haven't. If you want a score 8/10 ""Wall running while auto aiming is my secret kink""",1701732889,1701732889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I fervently enjoyed playing the game and can honestly say that it is great fun. 

BUT
And there is always a but…

1. The game may not be too short, but one may argue that it is too short for the retail price. I got it at a massive discount and actually enjoyed having a 7-ish hour well-designed campaign to play through rather than boring 20-hour mediocrity. 
2. Parkour. There are a lot of levels that just feel incredibly (and tediously) dragged out by forcing parkour into the game (or wall running/jumping). Those moments are the worst in the game and I honestly feel like the game could have been much better without these elements or with at least fewer of them. 
3. I may be asking too much, but I would love for there to be a way to play with the games weapons, because the game sometimes throws rare weapons at you and never give you a fighting chance to properly use them. 

Overall, a great game that could be improved, but…

For what I review this game's campaign, it's an instant buy with a cheap price tag. You're getting more than what its worth!

Gameplay (2.5/2.5): Respawn does an amazing job making fluid combat movement mixed with multiple gameplay devices and FPS moments. Works better than most modern day shooters.

Story (2/2.5): The story isn't anything special. It feels very inspired by Star Wars but with Halo aesthetic if that makes sense. It all works well and feels like its own world while being familiar to that kind of story and tone. But it felt satisfying especially after bonding with BT, the mech you'll be riding along with on your missions. Quick story, replayable, played on hard and would encourage others to too.

Visuals (2.25/2.5): For a game that's 7 years old, met by impressive world-switching moments (which we do to impress others in 2023 gaming) it's damn impressive. Character models look very outdated, but the world looks gorgeous along with all the metals you'll see. Some of the smaller moments stand out too.

Audio (2.5/2.5): Audio perfection. I haven't heard more immersive gun SFX. While also played by an amazing score, not worthy of playlist material for me, but damn good at keeping you invested in the world and the campaign.",1701593017,1701593017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game does look cool, and that's why I bought it on sale, but I just didn't really have fun, or enjoy it very much. I didn't even finish the whole game, because I got bored.
I guess, I just don't like the linear story mode games especially if they're FPS, where you just follow the mission marker and shoot stuff.

I'm not saying the game is bad, and I would recommend it to everyone, but it's just not for me.

Good:

-Graphics still look really good.

-The movement is, even now, some of the best in gaming.

-Interactions between Cooper and BT are compelling and are the heart of the story.

-Really good and interesting ideas which don't overstay their welcome.


Bad:

-Whilst the heart of the story is good, the overall story is cookie cutter at best. Other than Cooper and BT, nothing is interesting or compelling.

-The gunplay is serviceable. It does it's job and that's about it. Lack of variety, some sound like toys and such just don't make it a part of the game that can stand on its own like the examples above.

-Titan gameplay isn't as enjoyable as it could have been. Sure, your firepower increases when you're in a titan. But your size and slow movement just make you a big target. Not as epic as the trailers and the opening cutscene would make you believe.

-Hit-scan enemies/weapons. I don't think they fits in this game. The game gives you all these amazing movement mechanics but, in some cases/difficulties, the moment you pop out of cover, the enemies will gun you down. 
I just think that if this game had projectile based weapons/enemies, it would make the gameplay more focused on running and gunning and not just ""COD with advanced movement"". 

-The price is rather steep. Took me about 6 hours to finish the game with all collectables, which for £24.99 I just don't think is worth it. Though I did buy the game on sale for £3.12 which I absolutely think is worth it.

In conclusion, whilst this isn't one of the best games of all time, it sure is a damn good game.

The gameplay shifts seamlessly between combat taking place on-foot and while in your robot's driver's seat. While running around as a pilot, you're essentially an elite soldier, running laps around the enemy with sprinting, cloaking, sliding, wall-running and jumping. Mech combat is relatively slower, but with powerful equipment making for exciting fights against enemy mechs.

The movement is the heart of this game Apex is nothing when compared to TF2, Gunplay & gameplay is pure Sci-fi satisfying. Story is heart touching of a friendship between a robot & a human.

Don't get me wrong, the titans and tacticals are pretty cool but the 6v6 is what really kills it for me. Having so many pilots running around and roaming in their huge titans really makes this a chaotic nightmare to say the least. I be constantly dying left & right because of how many pilots & titans there are. And whenever I get inside my titan, I only be in it for like 1 minute because there are just so many people attacking me. And to make matters worse, people can respawn in an instant. Making it a guaranteed for you to deal with people 24/7. So 6v6 + instant respawn = absolute chaos.

Now, aside from the gameplay, there's also a few bugs I wish to point out. For 1, this game doesn't launch in fullscreen. I mean you can set it to fullscreen in the settings but for some reason, it doesn't save it. Like I would quit the game but when I get back into it, it launches in windowed mode. Sometimes it launches in fullscreen, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know. Very strange bug to say the least.

Now, for the 2nd bug, it has something to do with my mouse sensitivity. Like I would play the game as usual but then, out of nowhere, my mouse sensitivity gets altered. Including my mouse cursor speed. I don't know why this happens but either way, this game messed up my mouse somehow. Oh well, though.
Edit: Okay actually, my mouse is now fixed. I just restarted my PC and now my mouse is back to normal. I did restart it once but the mouse was still altered for some reason. I guess the reason why this time it is fixed is because Titanfall 2 is uninstalled. But either way, this bug needs to go.

Also 3rd bug. You can't connect to the servers. It would constantly say, ""Contacting Respawn servers..."" but it just does nothing. Luckily, there's a fix for it I found on YouTube by MaxPixel Gaming. But still, this should not exist. Like come on Respawn.

So yeah, buggy game. Chaotic multiplayer. Constantly gonna get 3rd partied in there. Or maybe I just suck at the game. Do I suck at the game? I don't think I do. But either way, I don't like having 2 titans & a pilot attacking me all at once. Like that is some gay stuff right there.

Edit: This game only gets better. Even when you're losing you're having fun. Wallrunning deserves it's own chapter in video game movement history. Combine wallrunning and grapple and your amateur spiderman dreams are coming true. You feel powerful vs fully shielded titans, knowing you can move and deal real damage.

Nothing is cooler than directing a titan from orbit to crash onto your enemy. Pilots feel like real dangers when piloting a Titan as well. And even when you lose you get to jam around the map and blow stuff up.

The learning curve is generous to all players too. Sure you'll die a lot, but you won't care as much because it's still fun.

I came into Titanfall 2 for one reason: To play the campaign. It's only 5 hours or so, and you can find it on sale for 5 bucks or less, I've always heard good things... I knew from my gaming history that I would have fun with the movement, and enjoy its mechanics for the short runtime before I ran off to play other games. But I was not expecting a masterpiece. Just the campaign of Titanfall 2 is a masterpiece. And now I am terribly sad that Apex Legends exists, instead of more of this...

You might be thinking I'm a bit crazy. After all, the analogous action to this is like picking up a Call of Duty game for the campaign. Those have never been the focus. Sure, they're good experiences that acclimate you to mechanics, preparing you for the multiplayer, but I always found them a bit shallow and one note. I heard Titanfall 2 was different. I'm happy to report that it is not just different but in an entirely different league. It's still short, at about 5 hours. But what it manages to accomplish in that short time is so absolutely impactful, so engaging, and so fun, that I can't help but gush about it.

First off, the gameplay is still smooth as butter, and the graphics are absolutely pristine, I feel it can all compete with stuff that's been released this year, 2023. Areas and factions have their own theming, guns are detailed, sound incredible, and feel great to use. The movement mechanics are beyond addicting, running on walls, and killing enemies as fast as you can, it is divine. Everything you would expect from a AAA shooter is dialed in to perfection here, and as a movement shooter, it all comes together in an absolutely perfect little package that I really believe every gamer should have the chance to try. It's all so good.

I found the story to be quite captivating, and the characters (especially BT-7274) to be incredibly charming. BT especially had a huge impact on me as a character, and it was incredible how alone I would feel in the missions without 'em. The range of emotions I felt over the course of my playtime is no doubt influenced directly by the expertly done score that accents your adventure every step of the way, not to mention the bewildering efforts of the voice cast throwing passion behind every line.

The set pieces really help set the game apart and climbing INTO a TITAN mech gives you a real sense of the scale for the areas you'll traverse, and all of it helps contextualize your journey to complete the mission. You're always finding new weapons to fight with, both on foot and in your Titan, and you even get some unique equipment to use, all of which contributes to a nicely paced, consistently fresh experience.

I still cannot believe how powerful this short campaign is. Can't stop thinking about it. Maybe movement shooters aren't your thing. Or maybe you're not up for it for one reason or another or whatever. Maybe you won't feel it in the beginning. Hold on. Let it marinate just a little longer. From my experience, I'm telling you this is something special. This is a masterpiece in its own right. Trust Me. You'll feel it.

Who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it enough to play the multiplayer (which recently got fixed!). This could add another 50 hours as a Pilot in this incredible universe. Maybe enough new players will get Respawn to make a proper third game. I don't know. But I'm fighting for as many who read this to take the first steps into the universe. Spend a few hours as a Pilot. Experience this rich story, and bask in its glory. I absolutely recommend it.",1701295203,1701295203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, I realized the moment this game is dead to me: the recent DoS attacks and the negligence in part of Respawn and EA. They really don't give 2 sh#ts to this already not-so-well-known game.

Edit: I *did* forget to mention, however, that if you're interested into the main story, I completely recommend it. it's no cinematic masterpiece, but the main cast is great, it has its comedic and serious moments, and the ending will make you cry, guaranteed.

In or out of your Titan, all the missions are great and will provide you with a lot of thrills and fast paced fun action.

The gameplay mechanics are a joy, wall running and jumping and sliding while blowing enemies away feels so smooth. The Titan play is also fluid but can feel a little slow compared to when you watch clips of them fighting each other. Lots of different Titan builds to choose from, all having different tactical benefits, and it was hard to choose a favourite.

I don't play a lot of multiplayer games these days but from what I did play it was enjoyable, with two modes. One is your standard PvP and the other is a team PvE defend the objective which was also fun.

Took me 18 hours to 100% the game, but the main story is only about 7-9 hours long depending on difficulty chosen.

This game has one of the most difficult achievements you'll face, if like me, you're not a top tier gamer. ""... becomes the master"" will test your patience and skill but a worthwhile foe to conquer. Just watch a video of a good route if you can't find one yourself and then improve your own skill level to match it. Took me 2.5 hours roughly but I wasn't going to give up.

Completing the campaign on Master difficulty has it's tough moments, but overall isn't too bad. I only struggled with one section and that was surviving roughly 3 waves of enemies and then escaping the section, it's difficult because it has no checkpoint and the enemies can burst you down in under 2 seconds.",1701258836,1701258836,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It has a great campaign, and the multiplayer is great in theory. The only reason this review isn't positive is that it's multiplayer is extremely hard to get into, the map design is extremely hit or miss, and cosmetics are quite grindy. All these points will be outlined more in depth.
Point 1: Multiplayer
As someone who kept trying to get into the multiplayer, I can say for certain a new player will get stomped constantly. There is no SBMM, so you could go up against a veteran with thousands of hours in your first match. Nobody bothers to talk in my experience, so questions won't be answered in game and you won't make friends. It's nearly impossible to get into, as you'll get stomped 70% of the time if you don't have extreme skill from the start. 

Point 2: Map Design
This is probably going to be controversial, but some maps suck. For this review, I'll be comparing Rise and Complex. Complex is made up of long, winding hallways and open areas for titans along with normal rooms and small hallways for pilots. This allows for almost all titans to be viable. Spawns are generally good. Rise, on the other hand, has two large and open areas in corners of the map, with long, straight hallways open to the sky. From one end of a hallway connected to one spawn, you can see the other. The only truly viable titans are Northstar, Tone, and Ion. Spawns in titan modes are biased towards one team generally.

Point 3: Cosmetics
Much less of a problem, but annoying. To obtain a flat color, it first says ""Unlocked After Pilot Regeneration"". That's fine, until you regenerate. You get yellow, the other colors are locked behind subsequent regenerations which you wouldn't know. Some cosmetics are nearly unobtainable without using a large sum of the in game currency which is gained very slowly (like 10 matches gets you 100, 300 for one nose art). Some are gained through annoying challenges, such as ""get 10 pulse blade kills"" (the worst one of all) or ""get 100 kills streaks with X"". That and the shop only cosmetics, which is a bit overpriced.",1670907163,1701247311,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played it back on the ps4 and abandoned my save pretty close to the end because of some distracting life event, never had the heart to replay it because i felt bad about that. But Wow... 
The whole thing can be crushed in one day, its not a lengthy campaign, but when you think about what its going for, it really shouldn't be. It achieves everything it should and more. The multiplayer was incredible for the time i experienced it, but i come in here on this steam playthrough with a different intent. This story doesn't blow me away in the sense of it being a grand space opera, it does achieve that grandeur towards the end, but its more about the bond with your mech. BT is such an awesome character, your evolution alongside him as a pilot, and the way the different enemy pilots are teased into your sights creates amazing momentum, every boss titan and their pilot becomes a memorable encounter. I don't think its perfect, but in the way that sequels can achieve so much more than their foundations, it is a triumph. I like many others really want a 3rd game. I think Respawn have a plan for it i'm sure, but it comes after the distracting license burden of Starwars, and the distracting live service pit of Apex.",1701216532,1701216532,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Matches don't get stale even if the other team is far ahead thanks to the opportunity to turn the tide with a couple of titans. Titan gameplay is fantastic and each has their own role, with Tone keeping their distance and chipping you away with missiles, to Ronin who will try and get up in your face with their sword. The campaign is also worth your time, with a great story that is really made by the interactions between Cooper and BT. Of course there is that 1 mission that will blow your mind but I won't spoil that here. Overall a fantastic fps with value that exceeds the price.

This is an amazing game, a fantastically wonderful first person shooter with very freeing movement mechanics, good weapon handling, visually stunning world and a campaign with an immensely captivating story arc.

[h1]The Story...[/h1]
So I heard about this game a while ago, I believe I even squinted at it when [b]Titanfall 1[/b] released but I never touched it for a few different reasons, one of them being that it was published by EA, another was the status of my wallet at the time.

I can't remember if I ever added it to my wishlist or not, and it wasn't until [b]Apex Legends[/b] released that I started become indirectly invested and interested in [b]Titanfall[/b], I started to learn about the [i][b]Lore[/b][/i] of [b]Apex Legends[/b], during which I also learned that [b]Apex Legends[/b] and [b]Titanfall[/b] were contained in the same universe![/u]
And for a time I kept playing [b]Apex Legends[/b], digging into the lore, with my interest growing and growing.

I finally made up my mind and bought [b]Titanfall 2[/b] and didn't touch it for a long, long time as it was, as previously mentioned, an EA published game, but also because at the time I was knee-deep in other games and also mostly played with friends.

Finally I decided to install it and test it out
[i]and boy, oh boy did I test it...[/i]

[h3]My first session[/h3] took me from 
[i]""interested and curious but laid back""[/i]
 to 
[i]""what the heck is this?""[/i], 
[i]""what does this thing do?""[/i]
 and [i]""how the hell do I get up there?""[/i]

Which meant I spent somewhere around 5 hours ""testing"" the game... and it was only 3 hours until my wake-up alarm would go off. 
[h3][i]""Oops""[/i][/h3]

What followed in the coming days was my full on head first dive into the game
The world building had me stop and inspect many a nook & cranny, a few of which lead me to a collectible every now and then, others stopping me in my tracks because of the sheer [b]Magnitude[/b] for some of the POIs and level design

The journey and the relationship of the Main Protagonist [spoiler][b]Sgt. Cooper[/b] and their soon to be partner, [b]BT-7274[/b][/spoiler], a relationship that [spoiler]started from a tragedy but goes on to grow into a beautiful partnership[/spoiler] that brought me awe and wonder, [spoiler] and eventually tears... :'( [/spoiler] 
Filled with moments that keep you on your toes, on the edge of your seat, impossible odds, breathtaking scenery, magical music that all come together like a wonderful dream.

The multi hit you like a train and in the first game you are overwhelmed from all the stuff u need to know and do, but still the best multiplayer fps i've ever played.

Compared to launch/when the game was still being officially supported/updated, the networking performance for MP feels like dog-water. Non-existent hit registration, constant warping/skipping. Absolutely awful. 

I can't speak for the playerbase where other platforms such as Origin are concerned at this point, but prior to hopping on to test this it had 5K via Steam. For a game that came out in 2016, thats pretty damn good to be honest. If you're a new player hopping into MP for the first time however, prepare for a very high learning curve; most that are playing at this point have been playing since inception and haven't stopped.

Regarding MP in short; viable player-base for serviceable matchmaking times (provided you queue every game type) // garbage networking performance (hit registration, player warping, ect). If you're not a legacy player, it's going to be a very rough experience. (Compounded by the aforementioned garbage networking performance.)

The single-player campaign is still up there with some of the very best ever created in the medium, and perhaps someday, when Respawn is done farming twitch zoomers for Apex money or making what is without fail the -worst- triple A PC port perhaps ever made where budget/scope is concerned, and STILL isn't fixed (Jedi Survivor), we'll get Titanfall 3. I wish I could leave an ""indifferent"" or ""mixed"" review at this point. The MP is a huge component of the game and I can't in good faith recommend the complete package.

*side note - this game runs amazing on PC, go figure*

In short - the single player campaign is amazing, and is worth your time, if only once. The lowest I've seen this game is for $2 on Steam, which is what I managed to pick it up for. 1000% worth it for this and this alone at this point.

The MP at this point is cancer laced with aids. Some of the most abject GARBAGE performance where networking is concerned regarding netplay in an FPS game sadly. It was -nothing- like it is now compared to launch/while the game was current. Spend your time elsewhere.

* For those of you who come across this review and have seen the numerous reports of individuals not being able to run the game via Steam on first boot - you MUST use the EA launcher bloatware that comes bundled with this (Origin replacement) and launch the game from that launcher AT LEAST ONCE. I got the same error trying to run the game initially from Steam. Once you do that, you should be able to freely launch the game from Steam without incident. Note however that it will *still* run that in the background as the networking/netplay services still run off that Origin backend and use EA's in-game overlay, ect. There is no way to get around this.

*edit - Almost forgot. Play Frontier Defense if you pick this up. Frontier Defense good.",1700894769,1700956833,False,2,0,0.532327055931091309,0,True,False,False

The ttk might be low but there's still so much outplay potential, movement tech and ways you can absolutely lose your opponent. The maps are so well designed for a game of this nature, every one with infinite movement possibilities. It's as if the maps play two completely different way when you're a pilot or when you're in your titan: this helps the games to feel fresh and never at a stalemate.

Now on to the campaign. I have nothing but praise for this too, with each mission feeling important and unique from its peers. The cool mechanics provided throughout offer interesting ways to traverse the map or kill your enemies, while teaching the player about all aspects of the game, preparing them for PvP combat.

Just playing frontier defense from time to time, not finished the campaign yet (the story is awesome), and somehow my campaign progress has been reset, probably bcs EA killed off Origin, PVP might f u up, speaking from personal experience, might have better rig and git gud.

Anywho, this game effin fluid, even with my 3rd world country hotspot speed, took a while for matchmaking, depends on your ping, the gunplay is so crisp, and the fun part is yeah, the TItans, and even more awesome you can take down them, as a pilot, talk about David vs Goliath here.

The pure speed of the combat pilot's ability to maneuver the battlefield is perfectly contrasted against the hulking feeling of controlling a titan. The campaign while VERY short has a decent story and excellent level designs. There is good enemy variation and moderately challenging boss fights if you play at the higher difficulty settings. Multiplayer is generally good though the game modes available tend to get old after a few hours or so. There is no competitive mode. This game is the big brother of Apex Legends so if you've played that title before the weapons and basic movement will be familiar to you. Overall the campaign is one of my favorites having played it 5-6 times so far. The multiplayer while not something I would expect to pour hundreds of hours into is fun and enjoyable. 8/10 for the campaign 6/10 for the multiplayer.

When frontier defense came i also loved it, i like the progression system and for once not PVP but PVE. and finally i dont have much suggestions for titanfall 3 but for the story, i kinda find it cheating of getting all the titans and than getting mods for them, i want there to be somekind of progression like skill trees, i also want to be able to BUY titans and specific mods at first so you dont get the free will being able to change at any time, oh and to add to that please make it where we can name our titans i want to be able to call my titan something like xr or p90, so that way we have more flavour to the game, and finally yes the multiplayer is nice but i want there to be a kind of territory thing, kinda like planet side or other games. also RIP bt may he rest untill EA announces titan fall 3",1700860824,1700860824,True,1,0,0.505882382392883301,0,True,False,False

I believe the game's story is amazing its simple and while the stakes and emotional drive doesn't seem that high you will be surprised by how good it is.  The movement is top tier and the multiplayer while slightly unbalanced is a ton of fun and has a pretty high skill-ceiling.

I really wish we had a Titanfall 3 instead of virtue signalling legends, a game that can't get ranked or balancing right and instead insults the world Titanfall 1 and 2 built.  I still like Apex Legends but TItanfall 3 deserved to exist, I hope with the recent updates and players that Titanfall 3 could eventually come or at least we could get another game in this universe.

I played the hell out of this game when it came out on console and replaying it on here and going completionist made me re-find my love for this game. 100% buy if you can find a cheap deal/sale it's both easy and fun to get all achievements and as amazing as the multiplayer is you should definitely try out the campaign.",1697822968,1700825861,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

When Titanfall 2 released, it was finally my time to take up the mantle of Pilot, and I wasn't disappointed for a single step or wall-ride. The campaign became, and still remains, one of my all-time favorite FPS Campaigns of all time despite being relatively short and the story being relatively simple. Titanfall 2's campaign doesn't pretend to be something it's not, but rather takes the short time it has to make some of the most fun in gaming I've had in ages, and this translates into the multiplayer as well. Hell, I'm dogshit at MP and yet I find myself coming back to it time and time again, especially as I age and as the yearning for that spark that only Titanfall provides increases, DDOS attacks and lack of support be damned.

This is a game made of passion, a game built on the hardwork of the first, using each aspect to its damn near fullest in ever surprising ways. I don't think Titanfall 2 will ever leave my top 10 games of all time, unless, of course, the long-awaited sequel releases and blows me away once again.

If you play FPS games, buy Titanfall 2. It's unique movement system, paired with stellar map design, satisfying mech gameplay and a fascinating world you want more of each time you delve into it, make it one of the best experiences I've had yet. If nothing else, buy it for the campaign and the amazing relation between a Pilot and his big Robot, fighting against the odds.",1700814420,1700814420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Disclaimer: I only played the campaign so that's all I'll be reviewing

Movement: The movement is good, I won't deny that. However, there's also something really clunky about it, I can't place my finger on it, but maybe it's just lack of practice. It would be improved by entirely removing the sprint function, with the pilot just moving around at top speed at all times.

Combat: Oh my word, the gunplay in this game is awful. Guns all feel lame, and they mostly feel the same, I couldn't tell you the difference between half the guns. The gunplay also hinders the movement as to effectively use most of the weapons, you have to slow down a bit, or very specifically path your movement so as to make your life easier, and it just ruins the flow.  The poor gunplay and movement are not helped by the braindead AI - they will genuinely just stand there and shoot. but they're so poor that I can literally just hide behind cover and play it like it's COD. There's no reason for me to use the movement tools or play the game well, which the game should actively be encouraging me to do, which further harms the fun. Also, regenerating health and a lack of healthbar don't suit this style of game, it really should have included something like health pickups for the pilot, not just the titan.

Story: For a game so focused on the story, the story is really lame. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about BT, the villains are awful, it violates Chekov's Gun with the main antagonist, the ending is unfulfilling, the plot lacks actual cohesion, and they just threw time travel in there? Which was really out of place and jarring. 

Graphics: For the time, the graphics are pretty good, although the faces look... pretty awful to be entirely honest, they look bad. But, overall they're decent if that's what you care about.

All in all, the game is really underwhelming, I would say buy it only if it's on some ridiculously good sale, or get in on Gamepass, but other than that, it's just not worth it.",1700708544,1700708544,False,0,0,0.402930408716201782,0,True,False,False

After 2 years of the servers being hijacked by a hacker, the now 7-year old king of movement shooters got an update out of the blue. An update that not only fixed matchmaking and connectivity issues, but refreshed multiplayer playlists, addressed out-of-map exploit locations and toyed with the brains of thousands of die-hard fans through cryptic in-game messaging about the potential release of Titanfall 3. 
The history of this game is longer than a measly Steam review could cover, but all you need to know about it is one word -phenomenal. And that's putting it lightly. You're either a fan for life, or you've never played Titanfall.

Titanfall 2's campaign is absolutely fantastic and a highlight of my experience. You never feel stumped in a level but don't feel like its blatantly obvious and boring. The main characters are awesome, especially BT and the story progression is smooth. You quickly grasp the mechanics and aren't spoon fed the solutions, however the option is there if you need it. 

The multiplayer is also quite enjoyable, yes you may queue with people 40 levels above you however it doesn't stop you from playing altogether which is a huge plus. Such games as Halo has a dead multiplayer fanbase and you are queued with pros and it isn't fun. All in all, there is room for improvement in the multiplayer but i still feel like the multiplayer gameplay is solid and enjoyable nonetheless.

I highly recommend this game, especially for the campaign!

Respawn Entertainment has outdone themselves, delivering an experience that surpasses its predecessor in every way.

The campaign in Titanfall 2 is a work of art. It takes you on an unforgettable journey, seamlessly blending heart-pounding firefights with an engaging storyline. You step into the shoes of Jack Cooper, a Frontier Militia rifleman who finds himself linked with a Vanguard-class Titan named BT-7274. The bond that forms between Jack and BT-7274 is nothing short of remarkable, as their interactions and evolving relationship anchor the narrative.

The level design in the campaign is a triumph. Each mission feels distinct, offering a mix of on-foot traversal, intense shootouts, and jaw-dropping Titan battles. From exploring an alien-infested facility to navigating through time-bending sequences, the variety and creativity on display are simply astonishing. The pacing is flawless, ensuring that you're constantly engaged and eagerly awaiting what lies ahead.

The combat mechanics are a standout feature of Titanfall 2. On foot, you move with incredible agility, effortlessly wall-running and double-jumping your way through the battlefield. The addition of the grappling hook adds a new layer of freedom and strategic options, allowing for creative movement and surprising takedowns. When it's time to call in your Titan, the exhilaration reaches new heights. Piloting these colossal war machines is an absolute blast, with each Titan class offering distinct abilities and playstyles. The intense battles between Titans are a sight to behold, combining strategy, teamwork, and explosive firepower.

Multiplayer is where Titanfall 2 truly shines. The fast-paced matches are a thrill ride from start to finish, with an impressive array of game modes to choose from. Whether you prefer the intense chaos of Attrition or the strategic depth of Last Titan Standing, there's something for every taste. The inclusion of AI-controlled grunts and spectres adds an extra layer of immersion, making the battlefield feel alive and dynamic. The progression system is well-balanced, rewarding both skillful play and dedicated commitment, while a steady stream of free updates and DLC keeps the experience fresh and exciting.

Visually, Titanfall 2 is a treat for the eyes. The graphics are stunning, with detailed environments, impressive lighting effects, and beautifully rendered Titans. The audio design is equally impressive, from the thundering footsteps of the Titans to the satisfying crackle of gunfire. The soundtrack perfectly complements the action, immersing you in the adrenaline-fueled atmosphere of the game.

In conclusion, Titanfall 2 is a masterpiece that sets a new standard for first-person shooters. Its captivating campaign, exhilarating multiplayer, and polished mechanics combine to create an experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of intense firefights, epic mech battles, or engaging storytelling, this game has it all. Strap in, pilot your Titan, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure.

A lot of people also loved it for its multiplayer matches but those servers are mostly dead now. The traversal mechanics were fun but playing as a Titan was for a bit.

There are a range of different guns for the pilot and the Titan but they are a little on the bland side with little variety, especially since the Titan guns give abilities and some later guns are just mashes of other guns. This game did not overstay its welcome that much but it's not saying much when it's only a 6-hour campaign. Still quite disappointing considering I had heard great things about it for years.

I want to give this middling recommendation but since I cannot, I chose to warn people to tone their expectations down a bit. Only get this game for 80% off or more, especially if you do not want to attempt multiplayer.",1700648490,1700648588,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I still hope that TF3 will come one day, hopefully sooner than later, this game is worth it.



Bought this game a few years ago, and loved playing it, especially multiplayer.
Multiplayer doesn't work anymore since last year, due to a out of control kid who's been ddos'ing the servers ever since.

EA and Respawn obviously don't care anymore about this game, and 'left the building' a long time ago; but what amazes me, is that this half cripled game, is still for sale?!! The Multiplayer part of this game is not even playable! (and prob won't ever be)

TLDR: Amazing game, a lot of good qualities, awesome community, and great modding, but abandoned by the devs (EA & Respawn).


1. It's got a short-ish, 4-5 hour campaign, but it's almost entirely action, with almost zero moments where you aren't in control of your character. This campaign isn't the best out of all the games I've played, but it is absolutely high quality and I love it to death.

2. The multiplayer is like, for lack of better words, CoD on crack.
As you can tell by the title and poster, there are giant death mech robots called Titans, there's a lot to choose from, but you can learn about those in game.

3. There are a few weapons of each gun ""class"" (e.g. rifle, smg, sniper, or my favorite, grenadier) which all have a pretty solid amount of differences between them, so there's a gun for everyone!

4. The movement in this game is insane to say the least. Have you ever wanted to go mach 1 by manipulating a giant robot explosion and ping-ponging off of 7 different walls to dome some poor grunt halfway across the map? Congrats, you can learn that here! There's basic double jump, clamber, sprint, slide, etc... but the main focus of the movement is the wall-running.

5. This isn't a point of quality, it's just a tip: don't stay on the floor, and hipfire is always more accurate than you first expect (except on snipers, of course). Run really fast, get in someone's face, and either blast them with hipfire, or melee them (melee on shots, and has a massive lunge radius)

6. That's also only the half of it. There's a launcher, made by the community to fix a massive DDoS incident that has since died down, called the Northstar Client.
I wouldn't recommend installing it as soon as you get the game, as I imagine it would be insanely confusing to use if you've also not played the game before, but the creativity of the people who designed it, and participate in it, is wild.

Northstar Client functions: Modding. It lets you use client-side mods (cosmetic mods) in multiplayer games. There's regular things, like changing a skin or two to make guns look more awesome, maybe changing the voice of the ai of some of the Titans, and a few audio changes too, like a different kill sound.
Then you go into the deep end. You can change the Scorch titan into Shrek, you can turn Northstar (the Titan in the game, not the launcher client) into Whiteglint from Armored Core, hell, you can find ported models of Honkai: Star Rail characters last time I checked.
You can find all of this by googling ""Thunderstore Northstar Client"" and that's where the massive mod database is kept (or on the Northstar discord as well)

7. Speaking of the community creations, the people that play Titanfall are some of the most fun players I've met, except for Deep Rock Galactic. If you have a question, someone has an answer.

Overall, this is a great game with many amazing facets to it, and you should definitely buy it whenever it's on sale, or even if it's not (only $20 at full price!). Try it out, worst that could happen is you refund it after a little bit of gameplay, but at least you tried out the giant space mech game.",1615589120,1700607599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Therefore, I'm reviewing this game from the multiplayer experience only. There's already good reviews about the singleplayer content available in this game, so just check them out.[/code]

I absolutely adore the multiplayer aspect of this game. They've nailed everything I wanted in a first-person shooter game. You can customize your loadout the way you want, there won't be any weapons/tactical/boosts/kits locked behind a certain class. You are free to create your own and run with it. The games are quick and you're thrown into action right away. From start to finish, you will be facing head-to-head with other players and their titans, giving you no downtime or any boring part of the match. You are rewarded at the end of each match whether you win or lose. Its the classic player progression wherein the only way to unlock the advanced loadout, is for you to keep playing the game. You don't need to use your credit card to get an advantage. Even though the loadout seems overwhelming at first, its not. It is very simple once you get to know things around. It doesn't complicate your options, its as basic at it can be, and its fun that way. Just pick your preferences and go on have fun with it.

In a market full of Call of Duty and Battlefield, Titanfall stands tall with the rest of them. Due to the recent surge of players and release to Steam, I hope this game gets the attention it truly deserves. It is one of those rare games nowadays where you feel great for winning, but doesn't leave you irritated when losing. Because at the end of the day, all it matters is you had a great time playing, and this is what Titanfall 2 offers...",1606385870,1700604955,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

[b](review updated: The game suffers from massive/medium DDOS attacks since 2021, which render it unplayable, community create a mod to fix this called Northstar, but some modes in thta mod no work like attrion, bounty and frontier defense during this time)[/b]
One of the best single/multiplayer futuristic FPS around there until this day, it has a learning curve that take time but when you dominate it the frontier will be yours. pilot 

matches are fast paced & full of adrenaline, customizable variety weapons,titans & pilots (operators)
The single player mode is worth it & take place 2-5 years after the events of the first game. TitanFall 1
______________
[b] Have in mind: the game needs a EA account (steam store page says it in big yellow,red squares) , if you already have one login in if no create one & follow the steps by steps

In case the launcher ask for CD key, close it, uninstall EAapp from your computer,restart the pc,run steam as administrator in windows,right click on titanfall,propeties,local files tab,verify cache, let the process scan & fix what is missing + start playing the game again (remember your origin login credentials) [/b]

RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) is a nitroamine (organic) high explosive. In its purest state, RDX is a white, crystalline solid, and when mixed with plasticizers and other ingredients it makes C4. RDX can be stably stored and is considered one of the most powerful explosives used by the military. One of the most alluring factors presented by RDX for military application is RDX requires a detonator, is resistant to detonation by small arms fire, and is 1.5 times more powerful than TNT (Trinitrotoluene).

 

11A word of caution to all our readers, every article published by allselfsustained contributors is either from personal experience or extensive research, and we make every effort to ensure each article is factually sound. Do not assume reading one How to Make C4 article qualifies you to start Breaking Bad in your kitchen with Skyler White’s cake mixer. In fact, if you try to make this stuff in the presence of government, you’ll end up in federal prison…

IS C4 ILLEGAL?
Whether or not C4 is illegal is totally dependent upon the stated purpose of its use by you. If you want to tell the government you need C4 to protect your fortified prepper bunker in preparation for the apocalypse, they’ll say no. To legally own C4 you will need a Destructive Device Permit (kind of like an NFA regulated firearm permit), and it must be approved by the BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives), and your County Sheriff’s office. For all intents and purposes, other than commercial, it is illegal for you to own C4. You have been warned…do not make this shit until after SHTF.

HIGH ORDER EXPLOSIVES
High order explosives are pretty easy to make when used with a basic understanding in chemistry, aside from the nitric acid used in high explosives. High explosives generally detonate because their molecular structure is made with fuel and three or more nitrogen dioxide molecules e.g. TNT (trinitrotoluene) – when a shock passes through a trinitrotoluene molecule the NO2 bond is broken, and oxygen combines with fuel.

 

How to Make C4 with RDX
Unlike other high explosives you can make RDX with this simple method, with the exception of the ammonium nitrate. All necessary precautions should be taken to prevent injury or death. Below I’ll list the equipment and materials you’ll need to make RDX.

Equipment needed to Make RDX
500 ml beaker
Glass stirring rod
Funnel and filter paper
Ice bath container
Thermometer
Blue litmus paper
Protective Eyewear (DeWalt)
Protective Suit
Face Mask

Materials need to make RDX
Hexamine (can substitute with Methenamine)
Concentrated Nitric Acid
Distilled Water
Table Salt
Ice
Ammonium Nitrate
How to make RDX
Place beaker in ice bath and carefully pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into beaker.
When acid cools to 20 degrees below centigrade, add small (pea sized)amounts of crushed hexamine tablets into the beaker.
The temperature will rise after adding the hexamine; continue to slowly stir the mixture with your glass stirring rod.
Do not let the mixture go above 30 degree centigrade or you’re fucked. Add ammonium nitrate to the liquid bath to cool it down faster.
Add more ice and salt into the ice bath to bring the temperature of the mixture to below 0 degrees centigrade. Maintain the temperature for twenty minutes (set timer)
Pour mixture into a liter of crushed ice, shake and stir mixture like a martini.
Allow the mixture to melt, once melted use your funnel and filter paper to extract the crystals while disposing of the corrosive liquid left over.
Bring a half liter of distilled water to a steady boil and add the crystals.
Immediately filter the crystals out again and test with blue litmus paper (you want it to stay blue), repeat steps 8 & 9 and the blue litmus paper stays blue.
Allow RDX crystals to be thoroughly dried before storage.
HOW TO MAKE C1 AND C4
You may opt to make C-1 which is a bit easier to make than C-4. C-1 is made by using 88.3% RDX, 11.1% mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin by weight. Kneed these materials together in a plastic bag to desensitize the explosive

C4 can be made with the same technique while substituting materials such as; 91% RDX, 5.3 dioctyl sebacate as the plasticizer, 2.1% polyisobutylene (or synthetic rubber) as the binding agent, and 1/6% mineral oil.

for 30 bucks this game is a steal IMO, literally the 2nd best campaign I've played just BARELY behind Halo Reach and is the best movement based PvP game out there. It recently got the servers fixed however (to my knowledge) the Northstar servers are still usable with a bunch of mods and shit if you like that stuff or get bored (somehow) of the base game PvP.

It's not bad, not at all! It's one of the better FPS games and campaigns I've ever played, but it's got plenty of shortcomings. TF1 has a superior aesthetic design and personally I liked the movement more although TF2 added in the slide which is pretty much a must have. The titans are better in TF1 though with their customization instead of this class based design. Pilot movement felt weirdly slow jumping back in. I've been playing Apex, FEAR again and Trepang2 and now TF2 just feels clunky. There's a weird stickiness and lack of momentum. As long as you're wallrunning then things are fast, but the second you touch the ground you feel like a slug. Maybe that's what they wanted, but it feels slanted towards those who focus on grappling and mastering the momentum. Weapons also all feel pretty much the same and have too much grinding. Apex is superior in the ground movement, gunplay, and TTK. 

Anyways TF2 has a lot of ""that was cool"" moments, but nothing that is really too memorable. I can recall Half-Life's storyline, even the universe of Unreal Tournament. But Titanfall? It's such a mess of different settings and themes that don't mean anything nor say anything. Buy it, enjoy it, but I doubt it will be something you come back to excitedly and relive the same experience as your first.",1602537103,1700207415,True,1,0,0.510879933834075928,0,True,False,False

Fast, free flowing movement with seamless transition from sliding to jumping, to wall running. A variety of Titans with awesome abilities like unleashing a barrage of missiles to feel like a boss, without ever feeling overpowered so the game is still challenging. The guns feel awesome, the characters don't just scream in your face for dramatic effect that gets annoying like CoD; they are just well acted with a sense of urgency for your mission. And the dialogue with your Titan has good humour mixed in too, it feels like you have a cool bond with it during the course of the campaign. Mission design is interesting too and has been well thought out to compliment your movement abilities with some really cool themes in some missions that think outside the box.

Only downside is I haven't been able to access the multiplayer servers but when I played this in the past it was excellent with lots of things to unlock with the different Titans, weapon skins etc so hopefully just a temporary issue. Was fun chaos with Pilots teaming up together to try take down players that had spawned their Titans.

Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA, Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter that builds on the foundation laid by the original Titanfall. Here's a general overview of the game based on its reception:

Gameplay:

The core gameplay of Titanfall 2 revolves around the seamless integration of parkour-style movement for pilots and the powerful mechs called Titans.
The addition of a single-player campaign was well-received, featuring a captivating story with a strong emphasis on the bond between the protagonist, Jack Cooper, and his Titan, BT-7274.
The game introduces new Titan abilities, diverse pilot weaponry, and creative level design that encourages both strategic thinking and fast-paced action.
Story:

Titanfall 2's single-player campaign is often praised for its emotional depth, character development, and unexpected twists.
The dynamic between Jack and BT is a highlight, contributing to a unique narrative experience within the first-person shooter genre.
Multiplayer:

The multiplayer component retains the popular features of the original Titanfall, with enhanced customization options, new Titans, and maps.
The multiplayer mode is known for its fast-paced nature, verticality, and the interplay between on-foot and Titan gameplay.
Graphics and Sound:

Titanfall 2 boasts impressive graphics, with detailed environments and fluid animations.
The sound design, including the distinct sounds of Titans and weaponry, adds to the immersive experience.
Reception:

The game received critical acclaim for addressing the shortcomings of the first Titanfall, particularly the lack of a single-player campaign.
Reviewers praised the level design, inventive mechanics, and the seamless transition between on-foot and Titan gameplay.
Titanfall 2's Metacritic scores were consistently high across platforms.
Legacy:

While Titanfall 2 faced tough competition during its initial release, its reputation grew over time, and it developed a dedicated fan base.
The game's unique blend of storytelling, fluid movement, and intense multiplayer action has contributed to its status as a cult classic.
It's important to note that the gaming landscape may have evolved since my last update, and there could be additional developments or insights into Titanfall 2.

My flavors of crack are CAR and The R of 97. High grade. Pure as it gets.
But if you like something thats only cut a ""little"" or is a budget option over all
I got you covered with the R101 and R201. Disposables. the only difference is the 200 series uses USB C to charge. 100s use Micros.

but if you want something that gives you the shakes i can offer you a ""< . >""
yknowwww the Flatline, the Volt, the Alternator. These are hybrids that use ""Addys"" because it will make you hit A and D alot hehehhhh

You like Kratom? Yeah its when you are trying to get off the heavier shit, but its still addicting in its own way,
So basically my flavors for you in this category are the G2, Longbow, Double Take and Hemlock. Nice and mellow. Don't have to do too much. You can stand around and still be ""present"" at family gatherings and events. Somewhat actively participating. Yadda yadda. Take it easy and don't operate machinery yeah you know the drill.

Like snorting TREN? 
Take a whiff of some Monarch Feet.
Nobody will ever question your strength. This magic potion is just 1 click away.
All you do is drink the Monarch Milk which I swear is only 5% APV and it gives you big muscles brah
You dont even have to go to the gym
why even try
you dont need to prove anything to anyone!

Take a shot of this Legion Liquor
Be so confident in your driving ability 
that you know you have taught your titan well
and you can now trust it to drive itself

You like jenkem whippets? try this Scortch bro. all you gotta do is hit that button on the side and hold it for 5 seconds. Now breathe. Just like that all your problems go away.

You like gooning? you are goona love the smart pistol. Its not even a drug but is definitely an addiction in its own rite. Sometimes the reason we do things is just to spite others, and we know they complain about it. BUT Sometimes we just need 12 seconds of pure bliss to fill our head with that funny chemical throughout the day to have peace of mind.

If you are on Titanfall 2nd Street, Angel City, you are my clientele. I have whatchu need. I got it all right here in this shop.

I've spent almost 20 years of my life playing a multitude of FPS games of every stripe, from 90's Build Engine games to the modern battle royal and extraction shooters; this is as peak as the genre has gotten so far.

The weapon sandbox, skill floor and skill ceiling, movement, feedback, and loadout customization here are beyond stellar. There's everything from the standard hitscan SMG's and AR's to a wacky twin-projectile sniper, a micro-missile machine gun, and a lightning rocket launcher. Loadouts allow for immense amounts of flexibility and creativity in how one plays, with grapple hooks and stim shots and wallhack throwing knives, cookable grenades and smoke bombs and satchel charges, and so much more. The movement is easy to pick up but has enough tech to leave a lot to learn and master even after 100 hours. Then there's the titular titans themselves, which all feel fantastic to use and each having entirely different styles of combat to learn and master. Not to even mention a well-crafted single player campaign that uses the sandbox to its fullest.

This game will never be forgotten, except by the people that made it.

One is quick, the other’s tall.

Titanfall 2 would be in the gamer’s hall of fame if there was one. The campaign is so good and it's been cheap for years.

If you're looking for a super long campaign or campaign that is going to tell a great profound story, Titanfalls campaign might fall short for you. Better to have a 7 hour campaign worth playing twice or even more, than a 10 hour one full of filler barely worth playing once though…

What the campaign will provide you with is a solid 6-8 hours of non-stop fun. Titanfall knows that it has a Micheal Bay action movie premise and commits to making it the best Micheal Bay action movie you will ever play.

The campaign has one massive strength with its story and that's how it develops the relationship between the character you play as and the Titan you pilot. The over-arching story is very much a cheesey Micheal Bay action movie plot but the story of Cooper(the player character) and BT is really something special.

Story is great always has been, multiplayer can be hit or miss depending on when and where you look for games.
Even with the servers back sometimes Northstar is just more reliable for finding servers and they have some pretty crazy custom stuff too which is enjoyable.

I would still pick this over Apex any day and it's one of my favorite games, if a game can make you emotional over a big robot then they did something right I don't care if EA says ""it had a failed launch"" they can do one as far as I'm concerned.

The same applies to those winging about matchmaking, the reason being that yes there are a lot of people who play this a lot because they are dedicated and hardcore fans if you want to keep it casual either play Frontier Defense or download Northstar and find a more laid back server.

My favorite part was when Cooper said its titanfall time and began to fall all over the enemy titans.

An amazing story with exciting character development all in a seamless and immersive game play that is pack full of fast pace action. As you embark on your journey to becoming a master pilot you will develop a powerful bond with BT (your Titan aka a mech) becoming a unstoppable ass kicking duo.
