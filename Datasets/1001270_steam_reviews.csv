This game is not merely a simulator; it's a vibrant journey into the heart of culinary passion, wrapped in the warm, inviting aroma of kebabs.

From the bustling streets of Berlin to the cozy corners of Cologne, the dream of owning a kebab restaurant has long been etched in the hearts of many. ""Kebab Chefs!"" taps into this universal aspiration with a dollop of enthusiasm, a sprinkle of hard work, and a generous serving of sheer fun. The game's release into Early Access has been met with the kind of fervor typically reserved for the grand opening of a real-life kebab empire.

But ""Kebab Chefs!"" is more than just cooking. It's about building a legacy. The game cleverly incorporates elements of strategy and teamwork, encouraging players to think critically about their culinary choices and how they affect their burgeoning empire. The feedback system, which critiques dishes based on seasoning, timing, and more, adds a layer of realism that's both challenging and rewarding.

The game's developers deserve a standing ovation. Their commitment to the community is evident in the constant stream of updates and new content, keeping the game fresh and the players perpetually engaged. It's a testament to their dedication and a big reason why the game has already amassed a loyal following in Germany, poised on the cusp of international acclaim.

In a world where the biggest German streamers have thrown their weight behind ""Kebab Chefs!"", it's not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon. It speaks to the universal dream of creating something of one's own, of turning sweat and spices into a legacy of delicious triumph.

It's a fun concept, but like many other ""simulators,""  this one severely lacks the diversification of products and services offered to both the customers (npc) and players alike. The fine threat to dangle upon is to make it easy and fast for challenging gameplay, but with a USP, or to make it just complex and diverse enough for authentic gameplay while still being fun.

I can recommend that one if u want to have a funny and half way realistic resturant experience. It´s rlly fun with friends but also fun without friends (for the ppl without any friends).

Pros:
Many recipes 
Good cooking mechanics
Many customizable things in the restaurant
Black Jack
Graphic

Cons:
You earn a bit to fast and easy money i was at day 20 at 130k
Bit buggy and glitchy some times
No real Kebab u know like the Döner that is served in bread 
no kebab razor or cutter (idk what this shi is called)

The game has some bugs but the devs are aware and bug squashing a lot. 
There is so much content in the game, but I really hope that there will be more restaurants and recipes coming. 

Would love to get bigger restaurants with hireable chefs to automate the kitchen as more of a end game type of gameplay. 
You can become more of a manager and have to sort out the bigger problems like customers complaining and having to re serve a dish to compensate and having Karens and other types of weird customers entering the restaurant. Weird staff who use food that fell on the floor and dont wash their hands and make customers sick etc. 

There is so much potential even if the game already has a lot to offer

Once you get up to pace with the game, you get sucked in, the level of difficulty is absolutely perfect, ingredients pour/combine to a set amount, unlike other simulators like Cooking Simulator where you can pour too much of 'x' liquid.

Like, hotfixes every day kind of buggy. The game's rough edges can test your patience, no doubt. But here's the kicker: it's ridiculously fun. I'm talking about the kind of fun that keeps you glued to your seat, laughing hysterically with your friends.

I've sunk a solid 42 hours into this game, and not once have I played solo. That's because the real magic happens when you're in the kitchen chaos with your buddies. Sure, we've encountered glitches, but they've become part of the experience—a shared frustration that somehow adds to the charm.

One of the game's highlights is the gourmet chefs feature. It gives you something to strive for, eagerly anticipating the arrival of each new culinary master. And let me tell you, it's not just about kebabs. The variety of dishes you can whip up is staggering, from savory to sweet. Personally, I've become a baking aficionado, churning out pastries like there's no tomorrow. And guess what? My customers eat it up (literally).

In the heat of the kitchen, my friends and I argue like true chefs. Gordon Ramsay would be proud of us. Whether it's debating the perfect seasoning or strategizing the most efficient cooking methods, we're constantly immersed in culinary chaos—and loving every minute of it. These arguments may add to the chaos, but they also enhance the camaraderie, making every play session feel like a high-stakes culinary showdown.

So, is Kebab Chefs a pain in the ass? Absolutely. But is it worth pushing through the glitches? Without a doubt. Behind its rough exterior lies a brilliantly executed idea—a testament to the developers' vision and the sheer fun factor of the game. If you're willing to embrace the chaos and persevere, you'll find a gaming experience that's as satisfying as it is entertaining.

One side note, this developer cares about their game. Constantly pushing updates, answering people on the bug forums in their Discord. This developer really has a bright future.",1706809376,1706809376,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

However, these problems that I've noticed haven't been gameplay related. Fundamentally it is a good game.

Pros:
Make restaurant
Make kebab
Sell kebab
Unlock different recipes, buildings, signs for your shop, and more

Cons:
Needs to be heavily optimised.
Inconsistent fps from 60 - 120 usually. 
Makes my gpu go max speed most of the time, yet not actually doing much.
Get more fps in battlefield 5 or gta 5",1706399796,1706399872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

(Bu arada özellikle grafik glitchlerine seri hotfix lazım. Oldu mu canlarım? Tamam gülüyoruz da... Çok amatör hatalar var. Oyuncular kalite güvence ekibi değildir.)
(Ayrıca bahsetmeden geçmeyeyim; oyunun endgame'i zayıf görünüyor. Oyunun sahip olduğu mikrosistemler ve minigameler içerik bakımından birkaç saati zor çıkarır. Yeni reçeteler açmak ve denemek de bir yere kadar tutar. Tabii kendi franchise'ımı oluşturup Köfteci Yusuf imparatorluğu kurma beklentileriyle girmedim ama...

Maybe after this you can add the spatula for us cause it’s really useful . And i noticed that I can’t pour the milk manually . Maybe can’t fix for it . Especially for measurement about the milk pouring . That’s all ! Btw Im playing on STEAMDECK and yessss this game run smoothly !! Love it !!,1705858072,1705858072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game loop is designed well. It allows you to customize your menu, which sort of acts like a dynamic difficulty-reward system that is under your control. Food prep flow is definitely improved and is much more user friendly compared to the demo I've played a couple months ago. They kept the fun parts without making it too easy. Having an option for the restaurant to be a self-service one is also a great idea especially for singleplayer.
There are still a lot of things to improve upon though. Such as having to carry even the empty plates one by one was a litlle annoying and I can see it becoming a problem when the restaurant gets large.It can be easily fixed though with having employees for example.
Apart from some very small bugs(localization and some funny physics stuff) I haven't encountered any bugs.

Graphic 1/2: It has vibrant colors and sweet graphics. There are a few details that need to be fixed, but they can be completed over time.

I know its an early access but my lord for the first hour i was hooked lol.

For future updates I would love to have more room in your place or even have more Variety on the food or Cakes, Maybe more Asian food or even Mexican food or Have some more Cakes or Cookies.
