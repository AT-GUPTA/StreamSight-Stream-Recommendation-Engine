Plenty of mods available for those less interested in the stock equipment and the maps. Many ways to advance your skills and game play no matter the skill set you have.

When I was a child at my grandmas house for thanksgiving, I was sitting on the couch watching my cousin play farming simulator 17 on the xbox. This was new to me, and I was instantly intriqued. The graphics, the cool controller, This was like rocket science to me. So you imagine I was obsessed with the xbox 360 and that game. I yearned for holding that controller and fucking harvesting crops. You can imagine that christmas, I only wanted that, and of course, farming simulator. That christmas when I woke up, I saw that xbox sized shape under the tree, but of course that was to be opened last. I ripped through the presents, anticipating the second I got my 7-something year old hands on the xbox 360. My first ever console. Finally, 2 presents remained. I grabbed the 2nd to last one, i ripped it open. FARMING SIMULATOR! but for the xbox one? Maybe its a mistake. I got the xbox 360, right? I finally got to the xbox.  I ripped it open like a damn feral racoon. Wait..this isnt the xbox 360? I defied physics and nearly did a double jump in the air as my brain processed that it was not the xbox 360, but the xbox one. The box looked beautiful. My first ever console. Every minute after i opened that box was hell for my parents as I begged to set it up. Eventually they caved and brought out an old tv from the garage. We plopped it down on my dresser, and we hooked up the wires. That beautiful essense of a sound flooded my ears as the green and white colors overwhelmed my eyes. We put in the batteries, and then.. I held the controller.. It was so cool, Once the lengthly setting up session was over with, I put in farming simulator 17. It felt like nearly an eternity before the game was downloaded, but my happiness did not waive! Once that little jingle played, i clicked on the game as fast as I could, and I heard that menu song. Like music to my ears, quite literally. I was glued to my xbox for a few hours at least until we had to go eat dinner. I was obsessed with that game for roughly 7 months, and gradually forgot about it. (Not my xbox though!)
Time skip to about 4 years later in 2020-2021, We couldnt afford a christmas that year or to do much, So i saved my pocket money for the brand new series X. Although I didnt need it, I still wanted it. By the first of december, i had 450$. To my suprise, My Dad agreed to pay for the rest, but i had to wait until christmas. Fine! As I looked on amazon for a gift for my parents and sister, I stumbled across farming simulator 20. Memories  flooded back. but woah, way too expensive. I looked and found last years version, farming simulator 19! I added it to my cart. I pressed buy, along with the gifts I had bought and a roll of wrapping paper. Then, christmas came. My mom fell ill and was in the hospital, so it was just me, my dad, and sister. I didnt feel like opening presents without my mom, but we did it on a facetime. Even though I knew that i had got one, I saw my 2 presents on the floor, unfortunately not under a tree this year, but That didnt matter. I ripped it open, along with farming simulator 19. I played that for a while, and watched farming simulator videos from my favorite youtubers as I waited in the hospital waiting room some days/nights. 

Janurary 15th, and my mom is released from the hospital. Thank god for those doctors who saved her life. Farming simulator helped me get through a lot as a kid and then. 5 months ago, I popped in farming simulator 17 to play it again. This game held some good, but bad memories. A single tear of happiness fell from my eye as I popped it in. Unfortunately, The disc was too scratched to be playable. Not much suprise, The disc is almost 7 years old. I had to save money anyway for my dads birthday, So i forgot about my xbox for a while. 

Now im here writing this.
Last night, I saw farming simulator 17 on steam. I could afford the newest one, but I wanted farming simulator 17. I popped in some card info, and boom. I played that for a WHILE last night.

To make a long story short, Farming simulator 17 played a big role in my life, and im grateful for it.  I know no ones reading this, but if the developers see this, thank you. :)",1703343984,1703343984,True,9,0,0.643564343452453613,1,True,False,False

Well FS 17 is obviously about farming if you haven't sussed it out so far! Modern farming. Modern farming with modern farming machines getting bigger and bigger as you progress. Yee-Haw! 
But it's not simply about driving up and down your fields in a tractor. It's a solid management game (mainly money): Should I buy a bigger plough (or plow if you like), sower or harvester? The plough might simply catch up with the harvester, making it unnecessary. Or should it be a 2nd harvester or another field? Should I take up a bigger loan in order to get both? Or should I simply pay off my loan first? Etc...
As time progresses you'll have more and more to take care of. It won't only be the work on the fields, checking the market for prices and handling you're braindead workers, but you might also be taking care of your animals (chicken, pigs, sheep and cows), driving X from A to B, doing the odd forestry, picking up hay bales you previously ran over, making plans on where to place your next investment, or simply sitting in a tractor with a worker inside and watch him do his work „Because I can afford it now“. Once you get the hand of the game, it quite self-explanatory.

It's slow paced, grindy, zen-like gameplay. So don't expect to be owning the best equipment within the first few hours of the game. Great often afk / halfway playing game: While playing you can easily listen to music (in-game radio is available), watch any series or sports, ignore your sister on Skype because you're trying to drive perfect lines, or simply think about stuff like the history of dog food.
I have most of my hours in MP: It's just so relaxing to drive up and down the fields with your co-farmers, honk every time you cross one another and pick up the odd machine fight because that same careless idiot touched you once again.
Easy time management in SP or with admin rights on a dedicated server (real time  - 120x). Servers are fairly cheap compared to other games.
There are two available maps at the moment. An American (according to the many stars and stripes) and a Russian (I only assume it's Russian, you know, Cyrillic stuff).
You've got a fair amount of official mods to choose from within the good in-game mod menu. Sadly they do not update automatically. It also would be handy if one could automatically download any needed mod once logging on to a new server. 

Something I really miss is seasons! Snow, hail and rain do exist, but there are no real seasons with different crops to grow or any other preparations to take care of.

Obviously I can't recommend this game to everybody. The first time I came across this franchise I shook my head in disbelief asking myself “What kind of freaks play this game?” Little did I know I would become such a freak. But that's it: you have to be the player who likes relaxing games with slow progress. Who knows? There might just be that little farmer hiding somewhere within you (you'll find it out soon enough, otherwise Steam refund policy).

You might just end up having a blast of a time in the economic branch which is the backbone of our civilization. The surplus of food over thousands of years combined with the many inventions leading to the very fact that you are now sitting on your lazy arse, staring at your screen and just wasted a few minutes of your precious life reading my lousy review about a farming simulator instead of roaming the fields and woods in search for edible roots and berries.

Farming Simulator 17 is an immersive agricultural simulation game that provides players with a unique experience of managing their own farm. The game captivates with detailed graphics, a realistic model of crop cultivation and animal husbandry, and a rich agricultural ecosystem.

One of its major strengths is the extensive fleet of farming vehicles, ranging from tractors to combine harvesters. The diversity of equipment gives players full control over the processes of cultivation, harvest, and farm management.

The game also offers a variety of landscapes and seasons, influencing agricultural processes. The dynamic shift between seasons forces players to adapt their strategies, adding challenges and depth to the gameplay.

The interaction with the environment and attention to detail make ""Farming Simulator 17"" appealing to both fans of farming simulations and those seeking a realistic virtual farming experience. While the game's specific gameplay style may not appeal to everyone, for enthusiasts of the genre, it provides an unforgettable experience with a touch of educational elements.",1696958589,1696958589,True,1,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False

Its an excellent insight into how farming is done. Its only £13 too for the base game. DLC should only be bought if you've put 100s of hours into the game and want more content. But if that's the case, just go and buy farm simulator 19 or 22. I bought this because there wasn't a demo for any of the games and this was the newest, cheapest option. I got my money's worth. 
19 and 22 have more features of course. But this game is worth it if you just want to see if you'll like this type of game. ""But there's a refund window,"" you say? It takes hours upon hours to really get a feel for this type of game so 2 hours really isn't enough. 

It takes that long to cultivate 1 large field!!!

I can now say without a doubt that I do like this type of game. I was looking for a relaxing game to listen to podcasts to. This is that type of game.

I play this at 4k and it is superb, so not really sure what the newer FS19 and FS22 are bringing to the party? I will definitely have a go at those though when the price is right!

Very chill farming simulator. No quests and no storyline. You decide what you want to do, what to grow, what to buy and what to sell.

sehr geehrter leser,

dies ist eine review zum landwirtschafts simulator 17 ich werde erst das gute aufzählen und dann das negative also fangen wir an

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

spielzeit : 979 std.

gut/schlecht verhältnis : 95% / 5%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

die 95 % guten dinge :

- die grafik : das spiel sieht auf seine eigene art richtig gut aus es wirkt auch sehr beruhigend und dank der vielen einstellungen läuft es auch auf jeder kartoffel ich meine es lief auf meinen alten rechner der von einem fetten hamster angetrieben wurde

- das wetter : das spiel hat ohne mods 5 wetter arten ( sonnig, bedeckt, nebel, regen und hagel ) mit verschiedenen realistischen auswirkungen so kann man z.b nicht bei regen ernten

- große fahrzeug auswahl : vom normalen traktor über hoch moderne kartoffel ernte maschinen  bis hin zum forst werkzeug und fahrzeuge zur tier pflege ist alles mit drin von orginal herstellern und einer orginal getreuen innen perspektive

- tiere : man kann sich um 3 arten von tieren kümmern wenn man will ( kühe, schafe und schweine ) mit sie sind echt süß und produzieren auch dinge wenn sie glücklich sind und ich persönlich schau gern kühen beim grasen zu 

- reale feld bearbeitung : das spiel ist sehr realistisch was die feld bewirtschaftung angeht so muss man pflügen, sähen, ernten und grubbern und zwischendurch mal richtig durch düngen 

- die sounds : die sounds im spiel sind erste sahne die fahrzeuge hören sich orginal getreu an und auch die natur geräusche sind echt entspannend da kommt man mal zur ruhe auch die tier geräusche sind richtig gut

- entscheidungs freiheit : dass spiel bindet dich an garnix du kannst machen was immer du willst

- große frucht auswahl : das spiel hat eine ganze palette von früchten die man anpflanzen kann ( weizen, gerste, raps, mais, soja bohnen, sonnenblumen, zuckerrüben, kartoffeln und pappeln ) 

- helfer : das spiel stellt einen bei bedarf helfer zur verfügung für denn fall das du alleine spielst diese kosten zwar ingame geld aber nicht viel sie können z.b ein feld für dich pflügen

- sehr mod freundlich : das spiel ist sehr mod freundlich und es hat auch sehr viele zur auswahl und auch einen eigenen mod manager 

- gute community : die community die das spielt ist meiner meinung sehr nett und hilfreich

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

die 5% schlechten dinge :

- wetter effekte : leider hat das spiel keinen scheiben aspekt was heißt man wird bei regen leider keine regen tropfen auf denn scheiben an fahrzeugen sehen die man weg wischen müsste 

- manchmal dummer helfer : manchmal kann es vorkommen das helfer fest stecken oder denken sie währen fertig das passiert aber meistens nur selten

- wenig tier interaktion : was ich auch vermisse sind dinge wie melken oder scheren der schafe oder sowas wie ne schaufel so das man nicht immer großes gerät braucht zum versorgen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


hier noch ein kleiner einblick was alles so drin ist : https://youtu.be/HvgBkobjgdY

so dass wärs kann das spiel jedem empfehlen auch jemanden der in die landwirschaft rein schnuppern will oder einfach nur ein spiel zum entspannen will
sollten noch fragen offen sein dann schreibt sie gern in die kommentare ich versuch sie zu beantworten, 

fröhliches pflügen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dear reader,

this is a review to the farming simulator 17 firstly i will focus on the good things and later on the bad stuff, lets do this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

playing time : 979  hours

good bad difference : 95% / 5%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the 95% good stuff :

- the grafic : the game looks really good on his own and its really relaxing too and it have many settings so that it works on ever pc i mean it worked on my old pc and that main engine was a fat hamster

- the weather : the game have 5 difference weather effects ( sunny, covered, fog, rain and hail ) with different realistic effects so you can as exemple not harvest when its rain

- many vehicles : from the little tractor over modern potato harvest machinery to the wood harvest stuff is everything in there are vehicles for animals too they all from orignal manufacturers with a orginal look

- animals : there 3 animal typs ingame you can take care ( cows, sheeps and pigs ) they look sweet and they product stuff to when they happy and what can be better as watching a cow grazing

- real farming : the game is really realistic when it comes to the field stuff you must plow, sow, harvest and cultivate and dont forget to fertilize real hard

- the sounds : the sounds ingame are great the vehicles sounds realistic and the nature sounds really relaxing too and the animal sounds are good too

- do what you want : the game let you do what ever you want 

- many stuff to plant : the game have a many plants you can plant ( wheat, barley, rapeseed, corn, soybeans, sugar beet,potatos and poplars )

- helpers : the game let you hire helpers for the work they cost ingame money but not so much they can for you plow a field for you as example

- very mod friendly : the game is very mod friendly and have much mods too it even have his own mod manager

- the community : the community in the game is very friendly and helpfull
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the 5% bad things :

- the weather effects : sadly the game dont have a window mechanic what means there dont be rain drops at the windows in vehicles

- sometimes stupid helpers : it can be happening that helpers stuck somewere or thing they done but they dont but that happening not very much 

- less animal interactions : i miss a bit stuff like milking cows or shearing sheeps or a shovel that you dont need heavy stuff to feed your animals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

here you have a little video whats in the game : https://youtu.be/HvgBkobjgdY'


so thats all i can recommend this game everybody even the ones that just wanna look how farming works or just wanna relax ingame

when there are more questions about the game then feel free to ask in the comment section i try to answer them,

Farming Simulator 17, the game so great i constantly come back to it instead of FS19.

(Warning your entering FS17 VS FS19 rant, if you prefer to skip i will put a marker named TL:DR for Pros and Cons)

FS17 is what i would consider the last true FS17 game. FS19 for its better graphics and John Deere dog whistle for Americans like me isn't enough.

 FS19 vehicle colorization isn't that realistic, engine sounds, horns,  and other sounds don't seem half as good. FS19 seems like a sissyfication of farming in FS19, it tends to fit the theme of Greta Thunberg farming. FS17 seems to fit the classic theme of farming and gives rustic buildings and tractors a realistic charm that FS19 cannot match. 

The modding community seems to be stronger in FS17 than FS19. FS17 allows for a larger fleet of mod vehicles.

You can throw up that bullcrap about better graphics and features all you want, but not everyone runs to a game for fancy graphics. I guess i have always had a bias towards FS17 since it was my first FS game, i have tried FS15 and love it about the same. 

FS19 also had a lazily made American map vs FS17. Giants could've done better with FS19 and the American map than they did. Generally when a American makes a European map for a game i would tend to expresses the best qualities of the scenery in said country. I just expect to an extent them to do the same since they made a decent map before.

(TL:DR)

Pro's: 
-Relaxing experience
-More machines than previous games
-More quality mods than FS19
-Great American map compared to FS19

Con's:
-Too many overpriced machines ingame
-Some mods can be too overpowered (Not the games fault as much as some of the modders :] )
-Not enough smaller machines

Overall FS17 is a great game if you do not mind missing out on some of the bells and whistles of FS19, also i suggest you check of FS15 if you want something similar, but cheaper.

Update: I have tried FS22, i think its an improvement over FS19. So FS22 might be worth trying.",1568818697,1675102924,True,14,3,0.678357124328613281,1,True,False,False

Hello, I love this game and I had a lot of fun hours in it in the past. unfortunately on a newer PC I got there is an issue that crash the game at start up, most likely related to the game's Modhub that is integrated inside it. I read that it is a known issue related to certain Intel processors. there is a reason why you would want an older farming simulator game, for hardware limitation or better prices. the game is fun from farming simulator 2013 inward at least for me.

The game does work for me now after blocking all game communication to the internet, though I will not be bothering playing it online. alternatively you can just cut the internet until you are in game. OR get farming simulator 19 or 22 if they are in a decent price. I've known Giant Games to stand by their products. and I am surprised they ignored this issue so far. 

Good luck and happy farming, or foresting !",1670967741,1670967741,False,22,1,0.669434070587158203,3,True,False,False

Now, will say there are drawbacks. Buying and selling I think was altered to majorly balance the game with this vs perhaps real prices that 15 actually had

1. Forestry is majorly nerfed from being able to make pretty good profit continuously from. Now, it went from a high amount, to a low sum per
2. Silage as well got cut by 1000x. So no more quick money schemes with this one

Farming honestly is the only fastest option ive seen in this game to make money. So I'll admit that did disappoint me a bit. As to balance the game the alternative ways of money making became stripped basically to the point that this literally is a: Farming Simulator

I like that things are better and easier for all in this game. Silage you can do with helpers now. Farming as well has a bit more help

Trucks now aren't a minimum of 200,000 to buy. You can get them from I think 120-170? I think its around there.

The game also gives you A LOT more to buy and use.

Getting silage as well is actually A LOT faster in this game. So will say that despite the almost insane cutback to kill it, they do compensate with the speed at least in a small way vs the cut. Can make 100,000 silage in the time it takes to mow and windrow 1 field basically. 

I will say it becomes much faster to start as the game does compensate for the cuts, a bit, by providing this: A golden nugget search

Right from the beginning what I'd recommend to get a fast start is to find the golden nuggets. It's not too hard, find a guide online on youtube to find 10, then the rest show on your map. Track them all down and you get a million dollars. Thanks to that you get a major jumpstart on how you want to play your game.

Now, there are small glitches in the game. Nothing major that will hurt the game experience where you'll stop playing. Only ones ive really found so far are:

1. Helpers when they are told to fertilize, or etc, will occasionally randomly find some other way to deal with the field, or row, vs what you would've planned. For instance, usually you'll do straight rows the longest way across a field. Randomly when you start the helper they will go the other direction. For fertilizing, theyll even leave some parts undone. Just the last part to clarify. It's a little annoying. Nothing too major as its easy do it yourself stuff on occasion, but small annoyances nonetheless

2. When filling a trailer with grain, etc, on rare occasion the trailer will look like its shaking and about to fall over, glitching out on screen, and can hit your vehicle. It's very very weird. It rumbles and eventually after it fully flips out, goes back to normal. Literally looks like a seizure on screen.

Other than these though, not really much that I've noticed

Small glitches, some major money changes, but still LOTS of improvements to the game allowing for far more than you could do in 15

I still plan to go through the games in order, to be able to enjoy them, and still be able to come back to them having played them, rather than get spoiled on all the features in later games and never be able to enjoy what the games before had",1670288846,1670288846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is not great, lots of lacking things and bugs. The bug will never get fixed, just like in the previous games, sometimes even the same bugs are still here. But this is probably the best game in this game series.
The price is right. The newer games aren't much different from this and they are very expensive for what you get.

You will need mods to fix the lacking features.

---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☐ Good
☑ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS
-
Not much to say. A game from 2016 with pretty decent graphics from 2016. You'll understand what you are doing. Better than the older games.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't
-
It's open world and you're free to do whatever you want.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf
-
Not much to say here. Semi-realistic sounds, but no variations. When driving a vehicle at the same speed it's like a 1-2 second loop that's just going.

---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma
-
A peaceful game and educational to pretty much anyone.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
-
Just use a graphics card that can handle semi-realistic 3D-rendering from 2016 (GTX 970 would probably be fine) and you'll be set.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☑ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
-
Standard WASD controls. Whenever more complex controls are needed, there's always pop-up windows displaying and explaining what each button does.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
-
You will need money for new fields and new equipment. Grinding is pretty neccesary for this part.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
-
There's not really a clear story to this game. You're just free to go around and complete missions or work on your own fields. The only real goal I see is that once you're done with the game, you will own all fields, have high-end machines and just generally have mastered every piece of the game.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☑ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
-
It depends. You could play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours if you'd like. Since there's no real story and you're just free to walk around and do whatever you want, most of it is up to you.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
-
Since there's new versions of this game out now, this one has become pretty cheap. If you're interested in farming life and one of these simulators, sure! Don't hesitate, it's not expensive. In my opinion, this game is the best in the FS-franchise. Huge improvement in graphics from FS15 and from what I can tell, there's no real difference in gameplay between this game and the newer games. Just the overall style is a bit different.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
-
Games like this tend to have a few minor bugs, however there's not any that I can point out in particular. You'll be able to play the game just fine.

Ingredients

For the base

150g/5½ oz digestive biscuits (about 10)
75g/2¾oz butter
For the toffee filling
75g/2¾oz butter
75g/2¾oz light muscovado sugar
1 x 397g/14oz full-fat condensed milk (see tip)
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the topping
300ml/10fl oz double cream
3 small just-ripe bananas, sliced
50g/1¾oz dark chocolate, melted or cocoa powder

Method

Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.

To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form.

Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top or dust with cocoa powder.",1510718819,1642785739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NOT a reskinned FS19. I have about 650 hours on FS19 and I can most certainly say this is much better in many ways, and many things have been completely overhauled.

- Sounds have had a major overhaul, makes the game feel more realistic and immersive.
- More placeables than ever, including sheds with working doors, refuel stations (diesel, methane, and electric), seed & fert tanks, etc. Fences too, great addon, easy to use.
- Many many new brands, and more tire brand options. Also license plates for equipment and vehicles.
- Character customization. Graphics wise, it looks a rather bit weird, but I'm sure it'll be improved. Unfortunately you have to change the character per-savegame, not any sort of preset in the main menu.
- Better organized XML files. Much more easier on the eyes compared to FS17, and easier to find things such as the money value. I don't need to use ctrl+f anymore, I can just scroll. (Speaking of XML editing, instead of editing the careerSavegame.xml file like FS17 & FS19 to add cash, here you need to edit farms.xml file instead in the same folder, careerSavegame.xml is only for appearance in the main menu.)
- Better organized shop UI, not to mention the UI overall. Imo, the weird blue fade on the speedometer/tachometer reminds me of the ol' FS13 UI, kinda wish it was more clean and simplistic as the FS19 UI, but hey, it is what it is.
- American-based map. Major improvement from Ravenport and Goldcrest Valley, feels more of the true american countryside thanks to that new office here in the U.S. that Giants got a while ago.
- Buying used equipment. As of now it seems limited to 4 pieces of equipment at a time, but very neat feature regardless.
- Vehicle gearbox. Not required if you don't want to use it, but I like it. A wee bit confusing at times however, I'm used to the way you shift in American Truck Simulator, but this is different. Not bad, maybe needs to be tweaked a bit.
- Obviously graphics, you won't really notice a huge jump between FS19 and FS22 as the major jump of the franchise was between FS17 and FS19, but there is some noticeable changes.
- Seasons. I don't like playing so realistic to the point I have to wait time for the proper planting and harvesting time, but there's an option to make it so the seasons are just visual only. You can also make it so it's one season at all times.

Now, there are of course many bugs with the game, and some features missing since it just got released today, but I'm pretty sure Giants will get most of them sorted out before the next year.

Some rather aggravating bugs/missing features are:
- Inability to remove buildings and fences on farms that already exist on the map. I have only tested this on Elmcreek so far, however, but it is most likely this applies to all other maps.
- Landscaping, a wee bit glitchy, controls are difficult to get used to from FS19. Can't sprint in landscaping mode.
- AI workers. We all know from previous FS games that the AI is notorious, especially in FS17. Here, there have been some improvements, and with the addition of AI being able to drive vehicles to and fro, that's really useful, but again, very buggy. The classic 'Helper F is blocked by an object!' pops up every now and then, you tab over and there's like nothing in it's way.
- With some vehicles, most notably (and only tested on so far,) is the Mack Anthem. It's not a true 6x4, more of a 6x2. I was hauling the largest CLAAS wheel loader & the 4755 with rear duals on the non-Lodeking flatbed up a hill, it almost seemed as if the rear axle of the Anthem was going backwards, whereas the front rear axle was slipping. Fine, maybe it doesn't have a lockable transfer case of diffs, but it should go up that hill with the most powerful engine in it, plus the weight on the rear axles from the fifth wheel.
- Buildings, most notably the farmhouse. If you look into the windows, it's just a copied .jpeg of a weird looking kitchen with yellow cabinets and a granite looking wall. I'm sure Giants will add in an interior at some point, I don't want buildings to start to function like the ones back in FS13. Also , you cannot interact/enter any existing buildings/sheds/barns on the farms on the land you purchase. I sure hope that gets fixed.

Bugs TL;DR:
- Existing Building Removal (Cannot remove them, this includes existing fences.)
- Existing Building Functionality (Cannot enter buildings and cannot open shed/barn doors)
- Landscaping (Buggy, a minor visual glitch, & controls are awkward)
- AI Driving/Transport (Blocked by basically nothing or drives the wrong path)

TL;DR:

There are many bugs, I hope they'll be fixed before the next year. But there are also many improvements from previous FS games, as someone who's played FS13 (Xbox 360), 17 (Steam), and 19 (Epic Games).

At this time, with the amount of bugs/missing features in the game, I would just wait and get it on sale in the future.
If you're someone who already purchased it, don't bother refunding it, just wait for the bugs to be worked out.

I have not tested everything, and I have not played every map. I do not have all of the bugs and missing features listed, I will update this review as I come across more notable bugs, missing features, and good changes from previous FS games.

Again, this is a newly released game, so unless Giants decides to not fix these issues/keep them removed like EA did with Battlefield 2042, then I will change this review as needed.

(literally a few hours after I made this review) Update:

Though this game, one can earn money quickly, however if played as in real life, patience is a virtue. 
Also this game shows the many ways; if one was to take on farming in real life,  in which to earn an income. As well, the benefit to hiring farm hands that will allow the farmer to accomplish other chores, preparing another field or the feeding and caring of livestock. Though many attachments are automatic, in real farming not so much; many hook ups are done manually. Still what one can learn to farming from this game is gratifying. Follow the process of growing crops and the feeding of livestock, one can succeed with much profit.

I'm Going To Go Through A Classic Pros And Cons list Then move To Final Notes, Ready? Go.

---------------------------------------------------

Pros: 

-A Lot Of Potential Content And Very Fun For Discord Friend Groups, Good Gameplay With A Theraputic Simpliticity To It, For The Most Part, Featuring A Very Large Variety Of Methods To Get Wealthy.

-The Game's DLC Content Is Absolutely Amazing And I Loved Every Second Of Having It, Highly Recommended

-Relatively Nice Community When You Manage To Talk To Adults That Are From Your Country (The Game's Community Is Completely Dead, Don't Expect To Find People Other Than Little Kids With Money Mods)

-Absolutely Beautiful Atmosphere With A Lot Of Effort Put Into It, Both Singleplayer Easter Eggs And Tips And In Multiplayer


-EXTREMELY Good Modding Community, There Are Entire Websites Dedicated To Mods For This Game And Some Of Them Are Truly Gems To Behold

---------------------------------------------------

Cons:

-This Game's Community Is Dead, And The Community Is Pretty Much Nothing But Money Mod Kids That Give Themselves 999999999999 Money To Buy Whatever They Want, Completely Removing The Game's Purpose From The Games Purpose.

-Casual Audience, Mostly 10 And Younger, Selfish, And Bad, They Don't Know How To Use Systems Like Recovering Vehicles From Lakes With The Anti Greif Tools.

-Not Enough Anti Greifer Tools, People Can Make Horribly Ugly Field Edits For No Reason With Zero Punishment

-The Ban System DOES NOT WORK AT ALL BECAUSE RETARDED DEVELOPERS, The Bans Only Last For The Current Game Session, Which Means Greifers That Log In Daily Have To Re-Banned Every Day, And Its Usually Harder Because They Change Names Regularly For No Punishment.

TLDR: The Game Doesnt Remember Who You Ban And Will Unban Them Next Time You Start The Server

---------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Farming Simulator Game's Get Micro Improvements Every Year, And This Game Is The Best Of Its Era (The Newer Versions Have A Functioning Banlist Though) And The Game Went Through Drastic Changes last Year, And I Believe It Was For The Worse, As It Turned Computers Into Ovens And Implemented A Really Poorly Designed Building And Terrain Editor.

Disabling your adapter or unplugging ethernet from your computer will allow it to launch, but that shouldn't be a solution. This problem has been popping up in the forums for months and there hasn't been a response from the developers or, better yet, an update to fix the problem. There doesn't seem to be any other solutions such as ensuring firewall exceptions are present. 

Original review below:

I got FS17 after playing FS15 for a long time, and I can say for sure that FS17 was a big step forward from FS15. It adds so many new details and polishes that really make the game feel more complete. I would say the most important step to that end was promoting a more integrated stance towards mods. The in-game mod management is nearly flawless (limited in my opinion by its lack luster and over-simplified GUI, but that's to be expected if it's going to work on consoles) that offers many expansions in the area of quality. 

The areas that I would say this game is limited comes from some of the clear limitations of graphics and ground display systems. While this is leagues more convincing that FS15 in terms of physics and graphics, I still deeply desire a more comprehensive physics and graphics system. In the physics department, I think I've narrowed down the main reason for my disappointment is around how the camera is affected by the physics. (Forgive me if this is a camera mode I could change, but I didn't find a way to change this.) The camera is completely static, regardless if you're traveling 25MPH on a flat road, or traveling 40MPH off road. I've seen examples where I am taken out of the immersion as I do a jump in a fast tractor (on my happy free play save) and the camera shows no emotion. There are a few explanations to why some people wouldn't like camera reaction to physics events, but I would simply ask for a toggle to enable / disable it. 

The graphics and ground response are also disappointing. The best animations for farm equipment seem to be from stalk crops being harvested by a combine. You can see the stocks line up (crudely) and guide into the blades. However, when it comes to the rest of the tools, there is no illusion or distraction from the cut-and-dry status of worked fields. Things disappear and appear exactly with no gradual application. Overall, yes, this much improves over FS15, but I want more. 

I have not played FS19 as I read that it is mostly an incremental improvement over FS17. I await eagerly for the future Farming Simulator game and hope that it shows greater strides of improvement. Also, this review may seem mostly negative, but I assure you, the 200+ hours should indicate that I do indeed love this game. So much so that I want it to be better and more fun.",1590124241,1633556827,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, me as a city person and have minimum to no exposure to the art of farming, I struggled quite a bit in this game. The tutorial doesn't exactly tell you what to do step-by-step either, it's more on the controls. 
The control is smooth and graphics is still beautiful though; so if you want a relaxing game to farm, it might be for you! 
I recommend with caution!

This game is perfect to sit and chill mindlessly and unwind after work. There are tons of tractors and tools to try out and collect and a fairly in depth system to try and learn and make efficient. It has ok graphics but runs very well with almost no game breaking bugs.

 But this game isn't for everyone and it does have it flaws. 

One flaw is that the games physics are a bit wonky, for example you can be in the biggest tractor in the game pulling a train of heavy equipment and getting close to an AI in a compact car or a small rock in the grass will dead stop you and the AI will just drive straight into you blocking you off. However AI can be turned off in settings.

Flaw two, no NPCS buts it didn't bother me much as it is just a relaxing game.

Third flaw sometimes items just FLIP out and go flying 

Fourth flaw is that tractor types matter very little most tools are interchangeable.

It's a cool Farming Simulator, but I recommend buying the Farming Simulator 19 or Farming Simulator 2022 (it's realizing soon.)

If you're looking to play for realism, don't buy. 
If you're looking to play to fuck around with friends, be my guest. You can fly around on wooden logs. You can also lift up a truck via grabbing logs that are secured to the truck via tension belts.

At the time, before FS19 came out, I would've recommended the game. But now, with FS19 already out and FS22 coming out soon, save your money.

If you're looking to buy, I'd wait for FS22. If you're impatient, you can go with FS19, there's nothing wrong with it other than of course Traffic & Helper AI, which is to be expected.

Stay with the just the starter fields, or expand by purchasing other fields.  It's rather easy with the base game maps to purchase all fields and eventually own the whole map.  Plant different crops.  Experiment with different equipment to determine your favorites.  The modded maps and equipment offer a nice variety once the base game becomes rather routine.  You can also choose to become a rancher, instead of or in addition to farming.  Pigs, sheep, and cows each offer their own challenges.

Graphics are really good as is. But with a texture back along with a really good map, its even better. Looks REALLY good in 4K with a Good 3D Shader and textures installed.

Audio

Some tractors and machines have a very generic sound. But all the machines sound really good and reliable modders are also very good at making great sounding equipment.

Audience
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☑ Everyone
Literally anyone and everyone can play this game. It's not super hard to learn even if you know very little about agriculture. Even for people who know a lot about farming there are limitless opportunities to Roleplay realistic farming. With this game it also gives you the ability to become a Organic Farmer. Whether it be Organic animal production or just crop production. The option is always there.

Story-
There is none. You create your own story with your farm. Do what you see fit to create a successful farm.

Difficult-
☐ Just press a bunch of buttons
☑ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Not so easy
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
Very easy to learn, easy to play and a very relaxing game overall. If you want to expand to other brands like John Deere and other multifruits that are not part of the game you totally can. Your farm can be as easy, and as hard as you want to make it. Smaller equipment takes longer to do large fields. But it's cheap and can fit mostly anywhere. Bigger equipment is more expensive, but can get the job done faster. Strongly recommend getting the Old Iron IH pack as it is very realistic and really IH should have been part of the original game. Perfect for small and medium sized farms/maps. 

Grind-
☐ Nothing
☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks
☐Isnt necessary to progress
☐ A bit grindy sometimes
☑  Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ Insanity
Its farming which means lots of tractor work which can get boring quick. Hired workers help but they seem to not be very smart. Using something like Courseplay can really help with the grindyness and definitely help with all aspects of the farm. Especially with harvesting with something like seasons mod where your crop will die if the weather is not adequate for crop life. There are many options to help make farming easier. But tasks are very repetitive.

Game Time-
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ Depends on you
☐ Endless

Price
☑ Just buy it
☐ Worth the price
☐ Wait for sale
☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended 
Very good game. Best farming game out there and a Much better improvement overall in the UI and general performance and with the Proper edition of forestry, No longer are logs flying across the map and 15 FPS multiplayer lobbies. FS 15 was a complete joke but FS 17 is the best farming game yet, From Cows, Sheep, Pigs and chickens, This game has it all, many fruit types, realistic farming and many many new and awesome features. The Great thing about this game is the AMAZING Modding community that can really enhance your Farming franchise by a cataclysmic amount. Worth a buy for sure!!!.

For realistic players getting Seasons mod is a must. This game is highly modable as long as the mods are actually made proper. The Graphics are good and the game runs well on lower to higher end systems with no issue. If you have a higher end PC then you have the ability to run larger maps with more mods allowing for more larger farming operations to take place. 

Like mentioned above there is an option to organically grow crops and animals which is fantastic if you want to grow organic produce and not chemical grown produce. Soils testing is not a thing yet in this game but the the mods more than make up for that. Certain modded maps also have there own unique features and animations as well as additional fruit types and graphics mods. 

Few bugs, most bugs are often caused by mods not working or acting up. This a great game to simply relax and play with a bear in your hand. not hard at all to learn and easy to play.",1529792182,1611447482,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

It has a wonderful community of people and some really intelligent modding which can either enhance your enjoyment or take it away but the best thing is; that is all based on your decisions.

My advice is use modding lightly if you have the time to farm correctly and realistically, try it, and you will love this game endlessly. Overuse of exaggerated and unrealistic mods, although mega fun when you're just trying to have a laugh and be silly with your farm, can sap the fun when you become a billionaire with no real work!!

That being said, this game goes above and beyond any simulation expectation and I can honestly say that I will follow this franchise forward. GIANT software really understand their customer base and provided a game with such a wide array of free choice and option!

I'm 100's of hours in at this point in time and still happy I stuck to the title.

A note about FS2019
I need to be clear, I have no problem with FS2019. I didn't get FS2019 for the same reason as I didn't get FS2015 when I was playing FS2013 ... every two years a new edition drops, which, eventhough it does build on the last, doesn't always represent value for money for me. I personally treat it as a sim and as such, it take times for me to get the setup I want, find the mods I prefer, make the edits I wish to have. Then to get on with enjoying the experience I've eventually built only for a new title to drop soon after and I have to start all over again is not what I need. The second edition down the line usually packs good bang for buck, builds on it's predecessor and represents a worthwhile purchase.
So the skipped 2019 which worked for me so far.

If you are new to Farming Simulator and happen to be reading this review, (unlikely I know)  I would recommend you look at FS2019. It is the better entry point and the community have already had plently of time to build up the mod databases also.

All that said, FS2017 is still an active and enjoyable FS edition and one which I can also recommend if for some reason, FS2019 is no an option for you. You can see by the price it commands also that it's popular. 

The mod community has been very active and for those with FS2017 already, it's so good that  I personally see little reason to move on.

A future expected Farming Simulator 2021 is confirmed by Giants as not happening (at least against the expected 2-year schedule (Sept)  that the previous many editions released on).

This might prove to be a very good thing. The based title is a solid foundation. FS2017 was  a huge success and FS2019 build on that with improved graphics essentially as well as some official brand content that has been previously addressed via the mod community. 
Where Giants to have more time to enhance, Environmentals (weather, ground, crop), Tools (farming finance and mangements) and User Experience ( IC, sounds, feel) aspects, they could establish a new foundation upn which the community would get re-energised and indeed secure the future.

So Giants have done a great job and have delievered products (whether it be FS2017 or FS2019) which really present farming in both a fun arcade way as well as a simulated multi player way.",1605610303,1605610965,True,24,0,0.770487487316131592,0,True,False,False

You need to do all the basic things that a farmer need to do in order to get any income. Of course, not everyting is there, but enough to get you in the right mood.
When playing for a while you will find your self to do the same thing all over again, and the motivation and challange might be a bit low.
But as long as you like to run a tractor with a trailer, or a combine harvester, it does'nt matter.

Graphics is on a level so that it looks nice on a few years old computer.

The downside is that some of the physics are not realistic, like the forresting, timber that feel like steel beams, and a control of the fork lift that is just bad will make you frustrated. The lack of deep perception is not helping.
The same goes for e,g, bales, pallets or anything that should be moved by a fork lift.
Bales are hard as concrete and the squeecing fork do not get a good grip on that.

But, I like the concept. Hope that next version (not 19) will solve some of the material handling physics.",1603133044,1603133044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
LOTS of mods, and people still make them here in 2020
Nice Base game machinery
The base game maps are 100% better than 19's base game maps.
In game radio
Cool Easter eggs such as the basketball court in Goldcrest Valley, or the golden nuggets in Goldcrest as well.
Windmills and Beehives and Solar panels give you good money
Lots of youtube vids on it
Overall a very easy on the eye graphics style.
A fun and relaxing game and it's affordable.


Now for the CONS:

Do I even have to say that word,
Physics......... it's broken.
no John Deere equipment
Seeders aren't as large as 19's seeders
Water textures

You start out doing jobs for farmers on the map and gain rep with them the more you do jobs and of course you get paid. You actually start out with your own farm, do jobs for others and eventually purchase more equipment and fields to expand your farm. You can also manage, purchase and sell Cows, Pigs and sheep.

Pros:
- great concept, using and operating all kind of machinery and tools, specialized for mechanized farming and forestry
- land modification with fields being plowed, sowed, fertilized, and not last harvested, even creating new fields or deleting existing ones
- great balancing overall, of the money income vs. expenses, with some small exceptions here and there, but addictive enough to spend time playing the game to make money
- plenty of free mods available from mods creators in the community, some great, some good, some that need some improvement, but a wide selection to choose from 
- plenty of YouTube tutorials from more experienced players sharing their experience makes it easier to grasp the more complex aspects of the game, as it's not really a simple boring game
- quite stable, for me at least, I had no crashed, no freezing, no performance issues whatsoever, works nice and smooth as intended, even on a laptop that's not top of the line
- a build in radio player allowing us to play our own mp3s or internet radio as we choose

Cons:
- maps are small to my taste, in short time there is nothing more to explore
- in-game time is not realistic enough to my taste, I'd expect real time speed with options to speed up if and when we want - like in FSX
- no seasons build in the vanilla base game, but somewhat solved by a great mod - however, the mod is not original from the game-developers, as such is still not realistic enough, one full year is passing in maxim 23-26 game-days (if I remember correctly) and to me at least, it's still not realistic enough
- no avatar per see in-game of the character, or the workers helping the character - there is a small attempt, but it's far from having an avatar/character to explore and play
- not enough interactions with the buildings, most are plain decor, useless, can't open doors, windows, can't place-move-remove furniture or items, really 90% of the buildings are plain decor with no actual function, except silos and some storage specific buildings

bottom line:
- it is a great game with great potential to grow even more
- it's fun, addictive, and educational, considering we learn a lot about farming, by just playing the game
- a great community of mods creators and mentors sharing their experience to make the game better",1592072900,1592072900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would honestly recommend someone buy this one over 2019 unless you want the most realistic expereience possible, I dont own 2019 but when I look at the damn price tag its way to much for what new features it offers, this is under half the price and you still get one good farming game,

The reason I dont have that many hours is because I simply stopped caring for farming games, Ive gotten a little back into it recently but in general ive just gotten less and less patient, I also no longer have any friends to play with anymore as they also moved on from the franchise

I'm in LA, so the last thing going on around me is farming, unless you're farming weed.  This game, and it's modders, BLEW MY MIND. 

You do the first two tutorials to get the gist of the controls and the basics of farming.   And it's the basics, I'm 140+ hours in and all I've done is work the fields on the first map.  No animals, I cut down a half dozen trees by chainsaw around my silos that were pissing me off because I kept ramming them, no chaff, hay, manure, blah blah blah, just joyously working the fields, learning where everything is, and buying shit (the lower three fields and better equipment so far).  To say this game is addicting, even to a city dude with zero ties or previous interest in farming, is a gross understatement.  Just playing the basics, you realize the layers of this game just go on and on, and how each crop (and animals when you get them)  interweaves with different functions of your farm, and each other, is one of the coolest applications of resource management I've seen, and I've got probably 50 RM games.

So the playability alone is endlessly challenging and engaging, but then you start adding the insane amounts of equipment that these farmers really use because certain crops need certain specialty equipment, fields of different sizes and shapes (not all of which can be worked completely with hired help), different crop cycles and crops, seasons if you want them.  It just doesn't end.

Then there's a second map to do it all over again.  Two maps normally draw a smirk from people, but all it takes is the two tutorials and 30 minutes on the first map, and you know you're in for some serious simming.

Then we go to the modding community.  I play (for better or for worse) many of the Paradox titles and their modding communities get pretty crazy in terms of tonnage and quality.  Nah, kiddie pool.  This group of modders, and I'm talking directly to all of you, are THE BEST.  It's not just such a vast array of equipment in every single category that your head explodes (there a dude modding forks for your Polish forklift for crissake!), it's the quality of the art as well.  You're farming in Poland?  No problem, every manufacturer in Poland has gear in this game from harvesters to tractors; Plows, cultivators and seeders; Tippers, tanks,  vats, spreaders, tumblers, turners, and some wind wheel thing that gathers your cut grass into a frickin line so you can gather it with some other piece of equipment.  Germany?  Sweden?  Italy?  Russia?  Got you covered, and which manufacturer did you want to purchase again?  Just so ridiculous that experienced players must be in hog heaven using all this stuff.  I can't wait to get there.  

That brings me to maps.  I made two sound like enough for this game, and it is.  How about 100 others in all parts of the world in real settings?  Almost all done with the same detail as the devs, but each has new ideas, killer layouts, different sizes, new start points with different field and equipment manifests, and all new crops, animals and functions not even found in the original game.  There are six regular and two root crops in the base game.  I think four animals if you count the chickens.  I've seen some of these maps with 14 crops and 8 animals types.  Then instead of 35 fields or so (you start with owning three), how about 80 and you start with 2 and less equipment?

Want even more play?  Play EVERY SINGLE MAP on one of three difficulty levels and start each game with lower resources, market buying and selling prices, and more difficult game dynamics.  I've got major time invested in a few games on my list and I can already tell this one is going straight to the top.  Just can't stop playing and discovering/learning new layers.

im just getting back into FS17, been on 19 for a while... been thinking of coming back to 17 for a while, it seems the physics are quite a bit better in 17 as they are in 19, and vehicle mobility is much better as well (in 19, it seems with arm/boon vehicles, with less than the best pcs, it doesnt like to recognise wireless mice... so yeah lul)

but yes, absolutely, i have lots of friends that currently play, and i intend on spending many more years investing time into this brilliantly crafted game :)

Yeah about that.
With over 500 hrs on this game i can say it's a definite keeper in my book.
The graphics while not as visually impressive as fs19 still look good and can run well on an ageing machine with a small supply of vram(512 mb to be exact) the core gameplay mechanics are simple yet fun. It offers many roads to make profit such as crops, forestry, baling, silage, and animal husbandry to name a few.

the reason i'm leaving a ""not recommended"" review is because of how Giants Software is milking its community for as much money as possible.  
almost each year they release a new title instead of an update.  
now that FS19 has come out this one FS17 is only $15, i would say its almost worth that but closer to $10.  
keep in mind the DLCs cost money too and some add more to the game than others.

Some other features have been improved, a little more realism has been added, (more dynamic soil, couple more crops types and plowing/fertilizing), and the game is an improvement over 'FS15', but I just don't feel that it were worth the 35€ pricetag. It just doesn't appear as if they actually did put all that much work into it. I would be satisfied with a price around 25€.

Pros - 
I find it pretty relaxing just driving up and down a field harvesting my crop
Graphics is very decent
Very realistic in terms of farming, any farming equipment you can think of is there

cons - 
I think what spoiled the game for me is the lack of customizability of the map. If you want to keep certain livestock you have to travel to the other side of the map to where the barn is. Its not as if you can convert a crop field into a field of cows. it would be nice to build outwards from your farm, not have different buildings and barns spread randomly over the map which means 3 min driving from corner to corner of the map just to do different tasks.

With full freedom to set your own goals and work at your own pace, this game comes with endless possibilities. I personally enjoyed the discovery phase of figuring out how to work the land, load the tractors and implements, then make money and expand the farm. Driving tractors is so enjoyable and mastering logging was challenging but very rewarding when overcoming obstacles that can suddenly appear. 

The real downside of this game is the time investment. I have a fair bit of free time and use it playing this. You can hop in and out of a game but find that it will take hours and hours to reach even short term goals. Some days I can put 6+ hours without even trying - and loving it!

I constantly am forced to put this game down and walk away because entire play sessions are totally ruined by this game refusing to function on the most basic levels. Nothing like setting down for a gaming sessions, just to have a specific machine you NEED for the job refuse to pick up the crop you've been using it to pick up for 100+ hours.

I'd suggest you buy this over the newer one, as it seems even MORE buggy. Avoid it.

I've never played farming simulator game before, but I kind of had good hopes due to all the postive reviews it recived.
However, the game was far from what I thought.

Most of the reviews are from returning players, who have played previous versions of this game. However, for me who just got into the game, the game was very unfriendly at introducing its mechanics.

It does have guides in game, however, I found they bombard me with bunch of keys that I am not even going to use often. Guides are too long, I do not need to be introduced to various fertilizer types by spraying it over and over, doing the same task that I will be doing once I get into actual game, but this is a guide. It could have been simplified by making me spray fertilizer once, and told me there are more fertilizers available. And often times, I just hire an worker because If I do it myself, it is going to take long and get boring, and the AI does better control of the equipment then me.

Then it just becomes a management game. literally watching the grass grow.

Oh my god! What a disappointing experience!

Yes, this version has prettier graphics. But if you expect a graphics quality of 2016, you will be disappointed. This is especially true for the poor floor tiles. The textures of the fields are still poor. Especially harvested fields, plowed fields and sowed fields just look poor for 2016. I expected a lot more.

Vehicle driving physics are a desaster! Driving a car or driving a tractor still feels like 2011. You think you are driving an electric car, but without the torque. The gas-reaction is slow and the power curve is unrealistic. For a game that has been in development for another 5 years after 2011, and where driving is a central game element, I would expect that the developer put more focus on the driving physics and make it a more realistic experience. It's a simulation after all, right!?

Gameplay-wise there is nothing fundamentally new. You got more crops to seed, you get more animals to care for. You get more unloading stations to sell your products at, you get more vehicles. You get more of everything, but you get nothing fundamentally new. No new gameplay! It's basically all the same like in 2011.
Caring for animals isn't an improved gaming experience just because you have more of them and some now need more/other food etc..

I played on the standard map ""Goldcrest Valley"" if I remember correct. The starting location I think shall be the player's home / central place. However if you would like to get into livestock husbandry, you find the corresponding stables scattered all across the map. What is this? This is just annoying! From a business point of view, where efficiency is essential, you would like to centralize to keep supply ways as short as possible. The whole map design contradicts this.

If someone doesn't own a previous version of this game and likes to check it out, ok.
But for owners of a previous version, this one here offers nothing new.

Both FS15 and FS17 are nicely polished to look at in my opinion, however having played flight simulators since I was a kid (20 years ago) I have always been more into realistic physics, interactive cockpits and the like rather than pretty graphics, and I think the FS series misses the mark on the realism element by a lot.

There is a lot of equipment to buy. Like I said above, everything is beautifully rendered and seems realistically animated from the outside anyway. Tractors sound decent with their turbos spooling up and diesel engines pinging away as they do and the interiors are rendered nicely, but it really bugs me that a game with the word ""simulator"" in it doesn't have functioning gauges and clickable buttons and levers in the cockpit. It's also a shame FS didn't take a page out of Euro Truck and American Truck Simulator and implement adjustable ergonomics (seats, mirrors, etc) while playing in the cockpit.

The physics of the equipment in this game is very unrealistic. Tire traction doesn't seem to be modeled in the vanilla game very accurately, the tractors and trailers don't feel wobbly or top-heavy as they would in real life, and the trademark big, bouncy tires that tractors have just ride flatly along all the different terrain in the game. The fact that one can drive right off a cliff and nothing happens to the equipment just seems wrong for a simulator. Getting back to the terrain, I would have expected a game from a genre with such a narrow field of features and mechanics to focus on would have done a better job of simulating soil mechanics such as deformation, moisture and nutrient levels, etc. That being said, keeping with the ""all-show-no-go"" theme, the mud that accumulates on the equipment looks good and can even be washed off if the player purchases a power washer.

As with pretty much everything else, the animals are rendered nicely and have decent animations, however I didn't find myself particularly interested in husbandry. I just didn't feel like there was enough to focus on with the animals. There's no way to directly interact with the animals, and that really kills things for me. There could have been a whole layer of bonding with one's animals while brushing them, scooping their poop, and whatever else that would have added depth and authenticity to the game.

My favorite part of the game is the forestry. Forestry seems to be where one can make what feels like a decent amount of money in a much shorter time than by working the fields, and it's novel to be able to fell trees and load them onto a trailer with a giant mechanical arm. I spent hours doing forestry while I hired the (rather dumb and buggy) AI to farm my fields. I enjoy how the trees cut differently depending on how the chainsaw is tilted, and I also like how the longer, straighter segments of wood will sell for more than pieces that in real life are not as valued, such as short, wavy pieces of wood that won't yield much product. This behooves the player to strategize about which tree they should cut down and how to subsequently cut the tree up.

All this being said, there is a massive modding community and many things that the vanilla game lacks can be rectified by using the appropriate mods such as a plethora of seasons mods from all sorts of parts of the world, a mod that attempts (to IMO a small degree of success) to improve the physics in the game, a mod that destroys grown crops when one's tires run them over, a saw dust mod that leaves a lovely looking pile of sawdust at the player's foot when they use the chainsaw, lots of different tractors to play with (even though as I said they all feel largely the same to one another), among a ton of other stuff. I never managed to find the realistic gearbox mod for FS17 that I loved so much on FS15, although I heard people talking about using it on forums.

In conclusion, I don't think the game engine is set up for truly simulation game play. The driving physics will never be as realistic as something like BeamNG.Drive or Spin Tires, the farming mechanics are rather basic to anyone who does a five minute search on Wikipedia about farming crops and what goes into it, and the animals are similarly simplistic. This game does however benefit massively from a steering wheel such as a G25 or G27. I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys a more forgiving, arcade-style game who has an interest in farming and likes things to looked polished, but doesn't want to sink a lot of time into a game with a steep learning curve and complex mechanics.",1574555248,1574555248,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Generally, I like the game concept. I like the vast range of possibilities and activities which are offered in the game.
However, it happened to me a lot of times that my crops just stop growing. Then I have to re-cultivate the field and to sow something else. Also, I don't get any money when I sell my crops at any other place than the Bakery.

Although Ive spent countless and I do mean COUNTLESS hours operation the machine in the game. It has now more so then often, made my time playing a spinning nightmare. Rotating through various machines and fixing a lot of multiplayer sabotages my experience with Farm Simulator has decreased from a 10 to merely a 1 because I not long enjoy fixing my farm from multiplayer disasters. Playing single player isn't as much fun but I deal with the loneliness. 
        Most of my farms are great plane farms with big machines and long drives. I don't have many maps to play on, of course there are some maps with obstacles that I don't like playing on. Because of the way I play fs my farms simulate agriculture in its best simulative form. As a student from a agriculture saving generation. I also take pride in emulating the trailor of farm simulator in general because of the place I was raised. It bring me back home when Im a couch potato in my computer room.
        Multiple has ruined my experience because most of the people who join only play to farm what they want, cultivate what they want and or play demolition derby with my tractors. So I don't enjoy farm simulator as much because My big farms are just another playground for newbies or political revolutionist who don't believe in simulators or video games in general. 
          In conclusion, simulators were made for an alternate real world experiment for fun and for practice, but sense 2015 farm simulator has become a playground for political prisoners to inherit a game of cat and mouse. Farm simulator has become to big on the worlds digital clock. What farm will there be left if Farm Simulator don't play by the rules.

Still the same machinery, pretty much the same crops and a postage stamp sized map, (that hasn't increased in size since FS11) with a few prefab placeables. As usual, there are a small number of machines available from the vanilla game, with some noticable omissions and they rely on modders to make up the rest and fill in the gaps for the ones they didn't include.

Unless they vastly improve this game and add stuff you can do as well as farming to increase the size of your farm with user-designed buildings, built from individual parts instead of prefab placeables and MUCH bigger maps, I won't be buying another Giants farming sim. Since Courseplay is one of the main mods downloaded for any FS game, you would have though Giants would have included their own version of it by now, or at least some sort of AI pathfinding to take a tractor and tools to a specific field from the farm and start working with them. 
IE: Plow field number 15 with X tractor and Y plow.
NPC starts tractor, finds and attaches the plow, then drives to the field and starts working.
NPC then drives the tractor back to the farm, detatches the plow where they got it from, parks the tractor where they got it from and ends the job.

Also, after all this time and you still can't hire workers to help you with the forestry equipment.",1572034995,1572035314,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Slow, repetitive, lacking clear objectives

I love the simulation/open world/building genre of games and this one looked right up my alley. I purchased 17 as the reviews were more favourable than the latest version.

The first thing I noticed were that the graphics were nowhere near as beautiful (good) as the trailers made out. But I can certainly forgive this, based on it being several years old.

I began by working my way through the tutorials, then jumped straight into the game. When in game, you continue to get hints which is great, as the tutorials only taught the basics. I was relieved to see that you can ""hire"" someone to do the repetitive work of driving up and down the fields. But you cannot avoid all boring work. A big portion of the game seems to be loading your trailer and driving into town or to other farms to sell your harvest. This can take a few minutes in real time. If you want to buy any equipment, you need to drive into town to pick it up, again taking several minutes.

One you've planted your seeds, you basically just have to wait. There is very little else to do other than visiting other farms, where you are offered ""challenges"" but these are usually as boring as spraying herbicides or plowing. You do at least earn money from them. I understand you can increase the speed at which time passes, but this would only mitigate so much.

Basically, the game-play is super slow and al though there is plenty to do and explore, it feels really repetitive. I kept giving it another chance and tried to like it, but I just could not really enjoy it.",1570876007,1570876007,False,2,1,0.469534069299697876,2,True,False,False

Mods really carry this game to the next level. I've found that for me personally, I have to set goals to keep my interest. Plowing, Cultivating, Fertilizing, Sowing, Harvesting, rince and repeat gets old fast. Its beyond me how anyone can play this game on hard with the amount of grind involved and how long it takes to save $$$. I play on easy, because honestly, I just don't have the time to invest. But, its awesome that the devs give you a choice on difficulty level.

That being said, any sand box type of game is really what  you make of it and Farming Sim 17 has the tools to do that, including the shear number of mods available.

Graphics are good and the game runs good on my potato of a computer. (GTX 970, AMD 9590, 16GB Ram)

Things that would make the game a bit more intuitive would be a search function on the in-game store page and in the mods section. The devs could also take note of some of the more, 'basic', type of mods and just make them standard in future iterations. Hiring workers is great, but they seem to have difficulty on fields that aren't fully square and or have trees and other objects too close to the headlands making turning around nye impossible for the AI or they get stuck. More thought could go into their map making on making sure to place objects far enough away to begin with. Although, I've had fun cutting down trees placed to close to fields.

Forestry/Logging is still the pain the *** that it was back in FS 15. Not sure why by now, Giants hasn't fleshed this out without players having to resort to mods, (not that all do).

As I said earlier, set goals in game. Working fields while fun at first, can get old. Buy animals (chickens, cows, pigs, sheep etc). Grow a variety of veggies/fruits. I've turned a couple of my fields into places I can put storage sheds, various types of tanks, garden centers etc. After the corny ingame music just about gets on your nerves, find a good youtube playlist of music instead, if you like jamming to tunes while you play.

This is a very chill game and if you feel rushed to get anything done, you're doing it wrong imo. For $20 its definitely worth a buy to melt some time away.",1570581639,1570581952,True,11,1,0.659491956233978271,0,True,False,False

Having been stuck in the tutorial section for 5 hours !!!!!! over a very long broken period of months, constantly going back to try again, and getting stuck in tree's, falling out the world, or being launched into buildings, or pigs which fly... I asked for a refund, and because I'd spent more than 2 hours trying to get a broken game working, they refused to refund anything.

This is quite possibly the worst most buggy game in the entire existence of the games industry.

Also shocking game design.

Get in Tractor, press A to attach trailer.
Says nothing about the strangely placed lunchbox in front of the tractor which is actually a weight, which you also need to attach to the tractor...

Checked youtube, and yes there are thousands of people who also had no clue how to complete this tutorial.

The designers of this game should never be allowed to work in the games industry again.

This is the view that lasts for at least a solid 30 minutes - maybe much longer.  If you suffer from migraine headaches this game may not be for you.

Oh in case you liked that other shot, here's another one going the other way:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1863553937

Grouchy:

After playing for my first 2 hours, this is mostly a driving simulator that involves farming equipment.  Yes you get to drive every inch of your field to harvest crop.  It's ungodly boring.  Then you have to figure out where to take your crop to sell it, and the game provides no clear explanation of how that all works.  Like for example, you can't sell wheat at the mill, because the mill ONLY accepts wheat from a train.  But the game doesn't explain this other than just showing the mill has train access.

Not convinced?  Wait there's more!!  You can PLOW TOO!  Every FREAKING INCH OF THE FIELD plow plow plow like there's no tomorrow!  Holy crap they'll let you fertilize it too!  I'm really not sure I can keep playing this without losing my marbles.

You know how RPGs are kind of dumb?  Where you just do the same things over and over again to level up and get new armor and weapons and spells?  There's not much problem solving involved most of the time, just hack and slash?  Yeah - this is exactly the same thing, but instead of armor and swords and spells its new tractors and a different crop and you can hire someone to help, but you're still going to do the majority of the work.  It's very grind-heavy.

But there is cow manure!!

I'm going to try to make it to the cow manure.  Then I will feel like I've accomplished the pinnacle of farming essence as much as I can in a game, without buying the farm!


Details:
You start with 3 fields, a truck, 3 tractors, a plowing attachment, a seeding attachment and a harvester.  These are all the most basic units.  2 of the fields are empty and 1 is ready to harvest.  There are hints on what to do next, if you can find them and figure out to run through them (don't try to click on them).

There are maybe 10-12 different crops you can plant and grow, along with animals such as chickens, sheep, pigs and cows.  All the animals need water, and some of them produce ""slurry"" that can be used as fertilizer.  Some of the crops can be sold in various markets and others are used as fertilizer.  Fertilizer is applied several times during the growth stages of the plants, and increase yield.  You start with a loan that collects interest.

You'll eventually find a store to buy and sell farm implements, including your pickup and tractors, and even garages.  You can buy seeds and livestock.  The strategy probably involves buying out fields before the competition does, which can only be done by maximizing profits to beat them to the best lots.


Positives:

What got me buying this in the first place - because I knew it was going to be pretty boring - was the exposure to all the implements of farming.  That's really pretty cool, because nowhere else will you find everything spelled out to this degree, unless you want to go to your local ""Big R"" farm supply store, but it's doubtful they could explain things to the degree this game does.  So this is really fantastic.

I'd recommend this if you like farming, or if you are really curious about agriculture with a tiny bit of economics thrown in.",1568477392,1568515991,True,12,3,0.606298983097076416,7,True,False,False

All and all ive no complaints.  It does get repetitive  but that is the nature of the job.  There are some things that have been added that take away from this though.  Logging is one.   

Once you figure out the basics its entertaining.  You finish the cycle from seed to sale with a few crops, look at the financials, and you can see a few places where you can improve your bottom line, this gives you some goals to work towards.  

Its a farming simulator and if you like that sort of thing, this game should scratch the itch.

There are a couple of things that would add greatly to this game in my opinion.

  The first is the need for tooltips.  There are so many symbols in the game that are not obvious to what they represent, it would be such a huge help to be able to hover over a symbol, and have a tooltip with an explanation of what it is.

The second addition would be to able to enter structures and be able to interact with the interior.  Maybe give us a bed so that we can speed thru time til the morning or something.

This game has been around for a long time now and its almost the exact same game now as it was in the beginning.  The core of the game has not changed.  Tooltips are as easy as anything to add, its just time, no real thinking.  A bunch of language files that get referenced to populate the popups properly.  The text exists already, just not anywhere handy.

The game already allows for enviromental interaction so being able to live in your farmhouse shouldnt be too big of deal either.  Make the houses prefabs and just let it be messed with like in Sykrim.

Making some new textures to represent a few new vehicles and pieces of equipment is not worth $30 dollars a year, for me at least.

Bottom line, decent game, 5 out of 10.  The devs figured out how to hook an audience 10-15 years ago and the game is pretty much the same as it was back in 2011.  A few new crops and logging.  Granted the do a great job with the vehicles and equipment, but looking at the latest model of some tractor is only going to go so far.

Buy it for $10 bucks, i wouldnt pay more.",1562429246,1562429246,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

While not as realistic as it wants to be, with its annoying physics engine and expensive DLC, it will still offer you a fun experience. The game lets you play with other people aross the globe, which is fun until the trolls come and ruin everything.

And then there's the mods. There's wacky crazy mods that lets you drive at insane speeds or fly, or mods that generally improve the game, like Seasons, Better Steering, MoreRealistic and the tons of vehicle and equipment mods. The mod support is a massive plus for this game.

Despite the positives, there are some negatives. The vehicle handling is not even close to realistic, and the DLC costs as much as the game, while offering a few tools compared to the 250 in the basegame.

Luckily this game was released when Giants cared enough to fix most bugs, making for a very stable game, and after the release of FS19, the game costs half as much.

+ Relaxing gameplay
+ Decent graphics
+ Runs well on most computers
+ Large selection of vehicles
+ Mod support

With Mods
+ Seasons
+ Realistic handling on most vehicles
+ Near endless amount of vehicles & maps

- Unrealistic physics engine
- Horrible steering
- Slow AI
- MP trolling
- Expensive DLC

Even after FS19 released, this is still a great farming simulation despite the inferior graphics and lack of John Deere, even better without the glitches and few mods.

I've played every farm simulator except for 19 and I have to say this is my favorite. The graphics are excellent, the interface feels better, and the in-game radio is really a nice addition you don't realize until you turn it on. There is a pretty good variety of decent songs and you can even add your own into the game files if you like. The game removed some of the exploit gimmicks (e.g., resetting equipment back to your farm with no cost or penalty) and added vehicle aging increasing maintenance costs the older the equipment to make a downside for people who buy some placeables and leave the game on overnight. Cutting down and selling lumber still feels a bit wonky, but it's improved since the 15 game. I like the mission changes away from mowing grass and deliveries to being a worker on another's fields. It's nice to increase your reputation with field owners to reduce the costs of those fields.

It hits the nice balance between the simulation and the game itself, giving you little milestones to produce that sense of achievement that real farmers would have to put a lot more hours in to get, (But they do actually get paid, so it balances out..).

If you're on the farmer's fence about this one, it will take time. A quick youtube video will tell you to sell all of your initial vehicles in person for the 20% increase in payout, withdraw a crippling loan (Not as bad as it sounds) and then reinvest all that money in less, but better equipment. A Panzer of a tractor, and some real neat equipment. I'm currently going for the maximum gain crop yield, which means ploughing the fields before sowing (That's planting seeds for those who are farming noobs like me.) but I now have to fertilise at all four stages of growth. Fortunately, the game has a helper system, where you can pay an extra pair of hands to do it for you. All you have to do is line them up with the field. 

I imagine this will be very important if I become a farm tycoon later on as you can buy many other fields and place logistical structures, but that process I'm doing will give me 100% more yield on top of what I would get with minimum effort. I'll definitely be doing it until I can pick up my second and third tractors.

Minor annoyances are that animals can be a long way from your home farm for feeding, watering etc.  You may also have to drive a long way to sell crops, animals.  It is hard to complete fertilising and spraying missions on  other farms when crops are visible as you can't  easily see what you have already done.  Harvesting grown crops for others is easier.  You will need to do these help missions at the start to be able to buy new improved tractors, harvesters etc.  Cheap old equipment is easily available from modders though.  The game is not for thrill seekers - like real farming it takes time to get somewhere but the game can be speeded up a lot so that you don't have to wait for crops to grow.  You can adjust many items such as growth, withering, fertiliser required in the game settings.   Sometimes equipment can get stuck but can be reset easily.

Personally, I think fresh air is overrated but this game makes it a lot easier to visualise and understand what my dad's on about. You get to drive cool machinery without getting dirty. You get to see something of the life of a modern-day farmer. And it's a great way to spend time without demanding too much thinking.

My only complaint is that, besides the graphics being a bit weird (distances tend to get these odd neon-green strips), the keyboard controls are RIDICULOUS. It took me days just to figure out how to operate everything and even now, I still have to check the interrinets for help. The tutorials are vague, so be prepared to tab between the game and your internet browser for help.

All that said, I'm enjoying it now I've got the hang of it. Although I still can't drive straight to save my life...",1558776546,1558776546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Co-op mode is disappointing. If you aren`t the admin, so you`re just a slave. You cannot buy or earn anything. 

Have you ever considered having a zen garden? Try cultivating or sowing the fields in Farming Simulator! It takes as much time as other types of meditation when you don`t really want to meditate at all. No, thanks. I`d prefer real dry landscapes.

With all that money from sponsors, how come do they have so few in game radio songs? It does blow my mind. Especially since zero main stream performers are there. 

Well, to sum up, I know that now they even have their own Farming League or whatever, and a lot of people somewhere love this game, and developers are trying to bring up the agriculture topic on the table, and so on and so forth.

I can't take this game very seriously but its a damn good game to play to kill time, or to cause your friends to re think there humanity when playing with you. 

With mods this game quickly goes full on realistic but can also really blow up. 
Examples why you should consider El Chapo Simulator 2017:
1. You can buy chaser bins (mod) which allow you to store a shit ton of cocain and drive it around. Im talking 290 tons of refined columbian white gold for your sniffing pleasures attached to a 1000 horsepower truck and, get this: get stuck on a tiny floor board 45 meters from the selling area. WELL FUCK ME
2.  A Harvester with 100 tons capacity and 50km/hr top speed (yes darling thats legal)
3. 100 vehicles to kill all trees and turn them into ching* ching* CASH (murican capitalism yee hah)
4.You can run over civilians and nobody cares.

For all those hardcore realists out there:
1. Dynamic weather
2. Dynamic tempritures 
3. Seasons with effects on crops
4. Physics system (you can catapult cows!)
5. Good driving mechanics
6. Mod support with 1000 + real company vehicles virtualized
7. surprisingly good graphics
8. very nice progression system
9. Dirt and track simulation inc. Getting vehicles dirty
10. You can buy houses /storages/ garages and place them down (*inhales* *gets closer* *whispers into your ear* *winks* Its free real estate ;)
11. rock solid multiplayer system
12. huge maps
13. Grow weed or do to cows and pigs what white men did to africans
14. You can hire filthy peasants to do the work you said you would *points finger* you! build me a wall and pay for it!

After sitting in my library for more than a month without being played, I thought, let's give it a try. And I must say, I have not played any other games anymore since that moment haha
I have worked myself on a big farm from my 16th till 21st, so I had some nostalgic feelings with a lot of stuff in this game.
But, now I can't get away anymore from it.
Sound is good, Graphics are good to very good. Mechanics are easy to learn and I love the ""relaxing"" gameplay.
Before you know it, you are busy sowing, cultvating and making more and more to feed your farm animals

now the negative things, and I must say, that I play without mods, so some of these things may be solved by using mods.
The helpers, not the smartest AI in the game, if your fields are too close too eachother, it may happen you are cultivating fields, that were almost ready to be harvested. 
The no damage, you can crash, jump, spin and hit other traffic, without any damage. Makes the game ""less"" realistic tbh
the limeted space at shops when you are buying.
When you want to buy pallets with seeds, food or fertilizer, you can't buy it in bulk, always pallet by pallet and not be able to load several pallets in big sowing machines or sprayers. Or even in silo's to store and use later.
THe lack of maps, when you only play vanilla.

But even with the above mentionned negative features, I love the game, it is relaxing after long day at work.

I'm not a tractor fanatic, i aint a truck enthusiast, i've never worked with animals a day in my life. But in Farming simulator 17 i'm a bonefied farmboy and after a genuinely tiring day in the office (in real life), I love coming home and getting straight to work on my farm! Its strangely theraputic, relaxing, and frustrating at the same time when you miss spots to plow or harvest, but all in a days work ay??

I will sit for hours and get lost in maintaining my fields, chopping trees, caring for animals, selling items, debating wether to buy that £520,000 tractor and a 12m wide plow. Is it worth it? DAMN RIGHT ITS WORTH IT. I bought this game on a whim, along side dark souls 3. And as ive gotten older, sure, occasionally you like to challenge yourself with games, which is what dark souls 3 is, but sometimes you just want to relax, listn to music, and do whatever you want without a care in the world. 

You can toggle Farm Sim to be as easy or as hard as you like. Want your crops to grow well but cant be assed maintaining them? turn off the need to fertilise.

It's about as fun as mowing the lawn, but in reality you hire workers to do all the work for you, so all you have to do it transport goods....  Truck simulator anyone?  I'm heavily disapointed that the wood logging system and bailing and such work so poorly.  Go to pickup a log and it chucks it or drops it.  Many of the attachemnts for things are useless like the log jaws for pretty much anything vehicle.  They either don't grip tight enough or drop logs with a firm grip.  Logs rattle around way too much in the wheel loader's log jaws.  Forklift anything and it works poorly.  Where are the straps for the flatbeds?  Now the store for a bit... If you buy something say a pallet, you better have your own forklift.  Any attachemnt you buy, you gotta drive or load that vehicle up to go and pick up your new attachemnt.  Back to logging...  chips...  both of the mobile chip makers suck.  I have no idea how they expected you to load the one with the crane and the one that has no crane will eat your logs if there isn't a trailer under the conveyor.  It's supposed to have a 5k storage, but it will stop there and eat your logs with no return.  2 full grown trees will make 50k~ chips  but for all that effort and extra equipment you can just load the logs onto the log trailer and sell them at the sawmill pond easier.",1547604118,1547604118,False,3,0,0.511766314506530762,1,True,False,False

You'll always get a good harvest, your animals are always healthy. More on that at the end. That aside, here's my experiance.
 So the thing that really stands out to me about this game is its repetitiveness. Basically, the goal of the game is to grind money to be able to buy things that help the repetitive tasks go faster, but that doesn't really change the experiance, the repetiveness.

For example, you start out with, well, bad and tiny everything. The tools are the width of the tractor, so cultivating, sowing, and harvesting each take 15 minuets at least on the smallest starter field, 40 on the biggest starter field. You just do the same thing: up and down the field to cultivate, or plow, it. Up and down it again to sow seeds in it. Up and down yet again, after a long wait- even if I turn time and growth rates to the fastest- to harvest it. Then you gotta repeat the process over and over again- cultivate, sow, harvest, cultivate, sow, harvest- forever. Then you just go buy bigger tools so that you can get it over with faster, and tools that cultivate and sow at the same time, to, again, get it over with faster.

And note that farm helpers are worthless as they drain your money fast and you AFK for just a few minuets, then you come back to see they have ran themselves into a tree and stopped work, or they have cultivated/sown/harvested only one row and then have stopped work, or have done the job but left big swaths of unworked land inbetween the rows of cultivated/sown/harvested land.

The tutorials really really suck too, I had to watch video tutorials and gameplay videos to figure out what I needed to do to, say, refill my seed sower, or what I needed to get and know to be able to take care of animals.

Once I realised this-the repetiveness of crops-, I thought, well, the crops part of this game sucks, so let's try animals! Well, there's no option to start an animal-focused game, you have to start on the crops path. So I grinded and grinded until I could buy the needed tools to care for sheep. I got four sheep to start off with. So I watered them, then mowed a grass field I planted, then collected the grass shavings to feed the sheep with.

So that was OK, but it was still really repetitive, and every animal exept sheep force you to grow yet more crops, often expensive ones that require their own special equipment, to get their productivity to 100 percent. Collect water from the river, mow, collect the shavings, feed them the shavings, take their wool to the spinnery to sell it, then repeat.

I am OK with repetitive games. My favorite game is the Isle, my second favorite American Truck Simulator. But Farming Simulator is differant because, like I mentioned before, nothing ever changes. Nothing. Sure, sometimes it's cloudy weather, but your animals never get sick and die, they don't die if you don't water/feed them. Your crops will never have a ruined or bad harvest, your tractor never breaks down, nothing changes. 

To compare this with American Truck Simulator, you never know what will happen, will some car crash into you? Will it start to spontaneously rain hard and you will slip? Do you have enough service time to make it to your destination? Will sleeping make me late? Do you have enough gas? Which job pays the best? Can I fit on that dirt road, or through that construction zone? *Will* there be a construction zone? Will I get stuck in traffic? And I can think of more questions of things that may change your trip.

But in Farming Simulator, you just don't have anything to pay attention to like that. No, you just drive a tractor up and down a field, grinding. No, you just get water, collect food for your animals. No, you just endlessly repeat the same tasks, trying to grind for the equipment to get it done faster! But it's still the same tasks, endlessly repeating no matter how fast you get a task done, you'll just have to do it again, and again!
 I also found it really unsatysfying because you just do the same things on the same field endlessly.

From that point on I have been hooked! It is very realistic and there is so much to do in this game and so many super cool vehicles and equipment. If thats not enough there are mods and when I mean mods I am talking thousands of free mods and many of them are really good. The graphics have been amazing and really immersive. So if you are like me and have an older gaming rig and are not sure it can run FS19, then pickup FS17 and you will not be sorry. My upgrade parts are coming in soon and I will pickup FS19. Oh and btw, FS18 is perfect for an on the go farming simulator and that is only $5 on Android and money well spent. Im sold on these farming sims and they have now became a hobbyso I can understand why many others are hooked as well. Also I think I have some knowledge about farming now, at very least I know what most of the equipment does.

Pros:
+Lots of new machines.
+New game mechanics, and improvements to old ones.
+Trains are now driveable, and you can transport goods with them.
+You can now rent machines, it helps making money.
+You can modify machines, for example, change their color.
+Pigs.
+There is cheaper machines for forestry now.

It's fun and relaxing to play with friends in Multiplayer, work hard to make more money, buy better and more powerful equipment or take care of cows, sheep and pigs. Although, no matter how much I like this game, there are many flaws to be fixed and features that can and should be added/improved:

-Physics (handling of bales/pallets; masses of equipment; etc.)
-Graphics (addition of Motion Blur, Depth of Field and Ambient Occlusion effects; shaders to be reworked; rain to have impact on textures; dirt mapping to be more real life-like; entire environment textures reworked and colored properly to have more realistic appearance; etc.)
-Gameplay (full seasons cycle; more difficulty options for players seeking maximum realism; horse power and mass to have impact on implements/trailers used; adjusted pricing of animals, equipment and placeables; separately purchasable biogas plant, animal farms, forests; addition of dynamic terrain and vegetation (highly requested); improved Multiplayer synchronization; etc.)
-Equipment and Animals (more youngtimer equipment that would be suitable for smaller to medium sized farms (highly requested); more animals to be added to the game (beef cattle, broilers, turkeys, goats and more); chickens to be purchasable (this was available in FS 13 and 15) and feedable; etc.)

There's a truckload and more things to be mentioned, but that's enough for now.

My personal score for this Farming Sim would be a strong 9 out of 10, developers put a lot of effort into production of this game, became more open with the modding community and also gave modders an opportunity to participate in contests and create official and fully licensed DLC's.

For the next FS I hope to see some new changes and additions, something that was never seen before in any Farming Simulator game.",1511393203,1543184132,True,28,3,0.693210899829864502,0,True,False,False

I bought FS15, but never had time to play a lot (just played around 4-5 hours). Now I have time to play and so far I'm loving this game.

The FS series has improved a whole lot since I last played. I wanted to wait until FS19 comes out, but this was on sale for only 8€ so I bought it to have some fun until FS19 comes out. 

What I love about this game is that it's both so close and so far from reality. It gives you the freedom to do whatever the heck you want. You can just be a casual farmer or grow your farm and make money from everything. I remember when on FS13 I created a career just to farm sheep. I wanted to see how far could I go. And turns out sheep are quite profitable.

It feels so different. Granted it's the same game but there are many noticable improvements. I am lazy and it's late so I'll leave it up to you to do the research on the differences but it is well worth the price of admission. It's a vastly improved game and the easy access to mods makes it even better. Pick this one up over 15 if you don't have either. Get this if you do have 15 and want a much better game.

- do you want to experience farming machines, incl. forestry in europe or US on a few maps, in a simple way? Also on low performance systems? Hire a stupid, but supporting helper?
  Yes? so you'll get it with this game. Simplified - limited. Graphic is not too bad, also for lower sytems

- You are missing some machines / want improving it?
  add some mods - you'll find nearly everything you are looking for..old to new due to the community / modders - check it before you use it, effects performance / I have 2 savegames: a cheated to test and my real game - delete mods if it's not like as expected

- some more industries, regions? Bakery, slaughtery - fruits - selling things - creating fuel
  Look for the right Mod-Map, it will be there. but be careful, some maps need much more performance..

- improve the stupid helper: GPS based, helper itself or controlled
  GPS enables straight ways, as it says
  AI-Helper: improved helper
  Courseplay: learn helpers how to do - my favorite, it does anything - 8 tractors for silage, sure..
  follow me or DriveControl ( i never used )

- Hmm, still not enough..make it more fun...
more monitors or adding a wheel -  sure works
controllers or gear change? - why not...
joystick for frontloaders and wheel .. yes, of course.
But you should regard your expactation. 20 bugs for a 90 degrees wheel cannot be compared to a 180 bugs / 1080 degrees wheel.  (+ see wheels below )
+++ just configure it on your needs, which takes the most time

- this is not a realistic ""simulator"", 
  add more realistic mods:
  + Ground response, adds some flexible experience on the field
  + Gearbox, so you can switch gears / 2WD - 4WD / differentials... friction...
  + more realistic, weights are effecting your vehicles, sinking deeper, higher friction

- that's not enough...
  ++ higher realistic? customize your ""more realistic"" setting simplified
  ++ increase view by shaders, textures
  ++ add fire department mod
  ++ add mining/construction map mod ...
  ++ seasons...
  ++ where to stop...?

I'm not sure, but if you can live with these limitations:
- it is raining ""inside"" the buildings/vehicles too, when it is raining
- crops are in your vehicle/running through your vehicle popping up
- performance decrease with your setup/addons

..FS17 can / ""can"" provide a simulator without paying a lot for addons like train simulator, the cheaper ETS2 or whatever. 
If you are willing to communicate in the right way, learning or customizing your setup...I never got a game, for such a low amount of money on sale ( 10bugs) including these possibilities. 
Regard that they try to establish an experience on different  continents/sytems/expectations....

Granted, I think most people had modded FS15 into whatever they wanted it to be, but this seems right from the start. Beyond adding a few trucks and maybe some other bits I don't feel that there is any point to adding to what is already there. I also really like that there aren't empty fields, they are all owned by AI farmers, and instead of running around doing delivery for cash early in the game now you can work the AI farmer's fields for cash. Overall a great experience and a big enough improvement to justify spending money on.

You just got nicer graphics, slightly different UI, few more trees in maps, but basically that was it. It was literally same manure in different package. FS15, although introducing forestry and much better graphics, was really big dissapointment. I have to admit that i didn't had high hopes for this FS17 game at all. On top of that, all the hype Giants did didn't help it at all. Their first released CGI trailer was almost like ridiculing gamers, and when they added 10€ for the price, I felt that this would be just another money grab.

I'm glad I was wrong!

This game have better graphics, of course, but also improved physics and few improved or added game mechanics. This time there are pigs and you won't just feed your cows and get milk. You need to clean the feeding area too and over time they breed and you get more cattle. I would loved to be able to get in the cowhouse and to manually clean the bedding too to get manure, but maybe next time. Another thing improved are trailers. In previous titles you couldn't use your trailers for nothing else than what they were made for, to carry crops OR to carry logs. You couldn't do both. This time, if you want, you can carry crops AND firewood, or pallets or even smaller tools with your trailers and you wont need separate trailers for that! And you can even carry smaller stuff with your hands.

This time, this is a working simulator. Previous titles were more like farming game, only mods made it farming simulator.

I'm not going to add all the same details other reviewers have said in thousands of reviews. I just say, if you are interested of good farming simulator but are unsure which one you should get, go check out few Youtube lets play videos and then get this. Do not bother with previous titles.

After you have bought this, from Giants main site you can get previous FS15 DLC packs upgraded for FS17 for free. There are also couple of other nice mods you certainly need and which will improve your experience. Go get them!

**Updated November 18 2018**

Farming Simulator 17 is out and I got about 320 hours in the game so far. 
Time for my Review/opinion of the game:

**DLC:
I personally love the new DLC's and I find the pricing to be just about right. Maybe a little steep for some of them, but it's (or maybe) necessary for a company to survive in this constant flow of games?
I'm not going to go into details about the DLC's other than they to add various amounts of new content to the game.
There's also Add-Ons from other companies you can purchase to add more content to the game. (I really like the Straw Add-On from Aerosoft).

General:
At first, FS17 felt like an incremental update to FS15. The gameplay is mostly the same, the controls, the menus and so on. There are of course graphical differences to the menus and they look nice and fresh. The controls can be better tweaked and there are a lot more settings to play around with to get the best personal experience for you.
After 270 hours I have come to understand that this version of the ""simulator"" is more, much, much more than just an incremental update. 
The menus give you a better overview of the various prices, livestock, fields etc. The map is a lot bigger and you actually have to plan ahead before you drive off to get your new tool/equipment at the store which adds to the realism. The same goes for delivering goods on the other side of the map. Is it worth driving all the way over there, or should I wait for the prices to climb a little more somewhere else?
-
In FS15 I had about 250 mods(!) 50 of which was ""essential"" and have now been added to the core game. The other 200 or so mods are sure to come to FS17 in due time thanks to the awesome modding community!

**Mods:
Mods, ah, glorious mods! The mods add A TON of new content and tweaks to the game. As of November 18 2018 the mod sites are bursting with both low and high-quality mods. For the most part, the mods are great and of high quality. I have 265 / 7.3 GB of mods running on my (modded) map as of right now and I can't see me playing without any of them. Well, maybe a few are non-essentials ;-)
I'm not judging FS17 based on the mods, but I have to say that a game that you have the option to mod, and that has integrated the modding well deserves a notion. Having said that, you DO NOT NEED to mod FS17 to be able to enjoy the game, there are hundreds of hours of fun without mods!

**Bugs:
Bugfixing is a big part of the ""upkeep"" of any game, and Giants are reasonably good at fixing.
Most of the bugs this game had on release are gone (a few linger on).
-
So far I'm overall happy with the game and all the new stuff like animals, crops, vehicles, and tools. But, there's always room for improvement so I'm listing them below;

Positive:
- New and fresh feel to the game / ""simulator"".
- New vehicles, tools, equipment, crops, animals.
- Vehicle handling and sounds are much better.
- Vehicle Customization.
- Better animal handling (they don't magically pop up on the pasture).
- Nice big map.
- Graphics and lighting are much improved.
- Texture and particle systems are also much improved.
- Missions! Actual missions to help your fellow farmers.
- Plowing/tilling the land finally makes a difference.
- Fertilizing up to 3 times finally makes a difference.
- Live radio streaming.
- So many small and big details have been fixed.

Neutral:
- Trains? Maybe they will come in handy (I only have 30 hours in the game so far). And I guess it's a little about how you choose to play.
- Still no ground deformation. I would have loved to see this in the game.
- Sunset/sunrise is still fixed in one location, no East or West...
**Still, after 320 hours have not had the use of trains.

Negative:
- Vehicle handling feels a bit ""jerky"" at low speeds, it's not as ""smooth"" as it used to be when trying to precision load a pallet etc.
- No preview when customizing vehicles.
- No Damage (I can drive off a cliff and keep driving).
- Still feels more like an arcade game than a simulator (but a lot of the mods usually fixes that to some extent).
- Rain still clips trough buildings (so there is no sense in parking them indoors). **There's a mod for that. I mean, the rain still clips through the roof, but you can add a ""dirty"" rain mod.

Recommended: YES!

The Farming Simulator series by giants software has always been the go-to farming game.
There's a good variety of crops in this game and it'll run with pretty low hardware specs, however if you're going to use a lot of mods i'd recommend you have a pretty solid gaming rig.

My honest opinion of FS 17 is good. It has a fair tutorial  could use improvement(but what game dosent). Its interface with the steam controler is good however not to many templates use the gyro to steer. I had to make one. Graphics are very good to good a little jerky at times. Getting used to days being growing seasons takes a bit of getting used to(but is very minor) Plowing is hinky at best but improves with GPS mod or Courseplay. More attention needs to be made to mega farms such as the farms in the United states not all of us want hobbie farms and yes bigger is better. Animals seem to be an after thought real pigs have litters of 8 to 16 not one at a time 50 cows dont have just 1 calf a season. Sheep usualy have twins and more than 1 a season also Chickens multiply worse than rabbits if you let them sit. Some farmers like to grow animals some like to grow crops. A lot like to do both when theres reward in it (money) The animal part of this game falls short at best.  The farming crops side of this game is very good although the selling part sucks when you sell a truckload of grain in real life the price does not go down while you dump you get paid the begining price for the whole load. In  game you lose while you unload this part was not thought out well. All in all this is a good game, it is fun to play. You can find loads of maps and mods. Most of the big maps suck! But there are pople out there who take pride in modding and there maps are great because they test and retest before publishing you have to sort the lemmons out like anything else. More thought needs to be made on function (dose it work flawlessly) in this game than pretty (A tractor can be dog crap ugly but if it works very well its valuable) and they will have a home run in the sim community.

But in all honesty playing as game like this or Euro Truck Simulator 2 is so relaxing after losing a game in CS GO cause my nuub team wont get a frag and will blame me for he speaks russian and of course being from Scotland... I do not.

But.. ENOUGH with my CS GO problems.. Back to this... Its a great game new Animals Mechanics make it alot more involved and simi realistic when it comes to running a farm itself.. 

If I were you I'd buy the game, simply if you dont like it... theres a Refund Option if you purchased it through Steam!

So for me... an easy 9/10! For relaxing after losing another game of CS GO and getting de-rank cause my Nuub team now speaks some BS language that I didnt learn in School!

Cheers to The Scottish Education system for not making me learn something better than French or Spanish!!!


Update 2018**
So been playing this for a bit with this dutch guy, yeah he's a pain... makes me play this for no reason other than to *annoy* me... makes me download mods and then reinstall windows to then re-download that same mod cause my silly self never backed up the file....

So I now give this game a simple down vote review as it makes me sad... but can wait till the next one comes out...

The introduction of Ai support for mowers and sprayers, although I think sprayer AI support were added in FS 15, is a nice upgrade from the previous games. The AI is much better than it used to be, way better, although it does have some quirks. They will get stuck on hydro poles or slight inclines depending how the equipment moves in a turn, but all-in-all it's much better than it used to be. New crops, new ways to fertilize fields, new equipment, new storage techniques, the introduction of a dedicated mod hub built into the game itself. All these things are why I keep coming back to this game, and really Farming Sim is just a game that you can sit down and play for hours.

I have only finished the tutorials and there was nothing stellar leaned from the experience.  I farm hay and processes are missing easily two major steps, cutting and raking, or one dependent on your equipment.  None of my tractors have auto equipment hook-ups, so all I can say it must be nice.

The comment that old equipment is misleading, but that is fine with me.  Please don't hesitate to emphasize, so I can continue to buy low hour equipment at a cheap price.  With respect to hours before maintenance, it would be more appropriate to see a table of  start times and interval hours.  Pick-up trucks normal go by miles or kilometers.  My truck is 24 years old and doesn't have an hour meter.  My wife's truck is fairly new and doesn't have an hour meter.  

Keyboard steering worked fine for the tutorials, but as soon as you start a career driving a truck becomes problematic.  So, I downloaded the keyboard steering mod and am now tring to work through over acceleration issues.  The control issues are very time consuming as the ability to escape back into options to make changes doesn't appear to be available.  You have to back out of the career make the change then start all over again.  

If you are an American, you find out that everything is metric and in Euros vs. dollars.  The forum comments regarding the matter are interesting, but don't address the fact game that the game is not globalized and lacks sophistication.  I can work in both systems, but this is a game and should accomodate all customers.  I did not see this point  advertised.  Guess I should have sifted through the forum comments before purchasing.  I have visited and lived in Europe; likewise, Asia.  I didn't buy this game to play in competition.  I bought this game to relax, so I don't need the extra steps.",1538570452,1538570452,False,1,1,0.434032052755355835,0,True,False,False

I've googled for a solution, but somehow it seems I'm the only person in the world that experiences this problem. I can see that the game is awesome, I love the idea, but I just can't get to the good stuff because each time I have to restart and each time I have to harvest my beginner field, cultivate them, seed them and do a few missions. But then I return for another session and discover that I have to do it allover again.
I want to play FS17, not Groundhog Day Simulator '17. That's really all there's to it.
Not recommended from me.

Edit:
After researching some more and making my google-search as stupid and spelling-error heavy as I could, I found some references to this problem with idiot-level solutions that didn't work.
I did find a way to finnagle a back-up that the game makes of the savefiles into something workable, so there's a work around and I can keep on playing my savefile. Still, that doesn't mean that I'm going to change my recommendation into a thumbs-up because I did find out that Giant was made aware of this problem quite early after this game went gold and Giant didn't fix the problem. A problem, mind you, that I learned exists in all the Farming Simulator games!
So there you have it. DLC that you can buy, but no fixes for persistent problems that carry over from iteration to iteration? If Giant wants a thumbs-up for that, they can suck it. It's not going to happen.",1537361820,1537364110,False,7,7,0.474969059228897095,2,True,False,False

Irl you at least learn stuff, like what cows need to eat during winter, or during lactation for the milk to have a certain percentage of fat, or what they need during labor... or exactly what kind of fertilizer you need to use and when for each type of crop you sow. But in this game it's all simplified. You fertilize the fields 3 times with *fertilizer* to get maximum yield for all crops. In short it barely teaches you anything.

I don't know wth I was thinking when I bought this. Guess I wanted to see some tractors.
Hours and hours of plowing, sowing, harveting... Nothing interesting ever happens. You spend your hours listening to engine noise, watching your vehicle going off course and yourself correcting it.

I guess I got caught up in exploring the world to figure out what other crazy thing you can do. I felt like firing it up again the other day, and after a couple hours I noticed just how tedious the core gameplay is.

This is definitely a matter of taste, I will admit. But I was looking for interesting and complex management elements, hell maybe even a goal or two, not just a vehicle simulator. I wasn't raised on a farm and I don't get a hard-on for tractors or any other vehicle for that matter. The pacing is the very definition of boring. Half of my game time was spent leaving the game open while taking a nap. Farm Simulator can be used as an alternative to Valium.

There is no management challenge here to speak of. Just plant, fertilize, wait, fertilize, wait, fertilize, wait, harvest and repeat. At high difficulty, the only way to make any progress is to just do a bunch of the side-tasks. Get a chainsaw and cut down trees to sell. Fertilize the fields of one of the many NPCs. Collect eggs and gold nuggets...

What I'm saying is, the optimal way to play the game is to ignore the fundamental mechanics.... i.e., the farming part of farm simulator. The fastest way to advance is to mow grass. I shit you not: the most profitable activity you can do as a farmer is mow grass, stamp the living shit out of it with your tractor for a half hour, and then after a bunch of waiting, selling the silage to your friendly neighborhood biofuels plant. Now that's sad. And probably realistic, too. I guess it's my fault for playing on ""realistic"" difficulty.

I used to think farming simulators were nothing but a big cash grab in the simulator games. You see the fast development of many simulator games that are developed across the world just to make some fast cash. They usually are full of bugs with severely broken languages due to way over use of Google translate. 

This is NOT one of those games. 

This is a great game. This is a classic. And a an all time favorite. 

The Farming Simulator franchise is a very successful series of games focused solely on becoming a farmer. 

You can find their games on mobile devices as well and they are just as good. I am a huge fan of the mobile version of these games because they are so identical to the pc versions. 

The game is simple. Farm. 

You start with very little. A few plots and some basic equipment. You can choose to take out some loans to help get you some better things but you really gotta get farming. 

Get in that tractor and start clearing away that field. Plant your seed... Lol... Then move on to the next. Get everything planted and speed up time to watch the fields grow. 

Time to start collecting your crops. Be sure to use a good size tipper to collect as much as possible to help limit how many times you need to empty out. 

The game also includes animals such as pigs, cows, and sheep. They come in handy for some extra cash as well as fertilizer for your plants. 

If you wanted to more than one thing at once, you can use AI helpers to get more work done. Plow a field, collect your crops, they can help! Unfortunately they cannot sell your merchandise... This is something the mobile versions offer though. 

One of the coolest features of the games is the mod work provided by the fans. You can find custom maps, tractors and equipment. Even some custom scripts for special occasions. It's pretty cool this is offered and has such popularity 

And if you want to work on your farm with a friend, the game offers multiplayer support! 

Overall... These farming games are wonderful. They are detailed, look beautiful, and offer plenty of fun. If you like tycoon simulator games, this is for you. Much fun for you!!!!

The UI and Tutorials do a horrendous job, to get you in the game.

Also economically uninteresting. You start off with almost everything needed. Would be cooler with a Harvest Moon vibe, like starting off with a small shed and upgrading after each big harvest. This game be like: Silos? TRAINS?! ANIMALS?!? We got you, bro.

You might just say ""But wait! It's a simualtor!"" So tell me then when did a farmer invent instant teleportation and can switch from one vehicle to another, which are kilometers apart, in an instant?

There's a lot of things to do epecially if you add mods. You can play the game several different ways. If you're the kind of person that likes to grind to get better equipment and nicer stuff, the vanilla game is perfect for you. Each and every upgrade will feel extremely rewarding because you worked for it. If you're the type that wants the best equipment quickly, you can do that too by building up enough money to buy things like solar panels which earn income and require no maintanence. To get money quickly you can exploit the game by speeding up time and buying more solar panels from the income until you eventually can buy wind turbines which make lots of money. You could literally turn your farm into a wind farm and be a billionaire and buy everything you want and do it rather quickly. It's certainly not challenging and the sense of reward will be gone, but the option is there for people who just want to buy and collect everything. You can also try to find 100 hidden gold nuggets which is fun and challenging and has a huge monetary payback. This feels much more rewarding because it takes time and work. You can raise animals which can become very involved but is quite fun if you like to keep busy. You must grow or buy ingredients for their feed, mix their feed, give them bedding, clean their mess and use it for fertilizer or sell it, breed them, etc. You can log forests and if you download the mods you can eventually sell furniture. Or you can just farm your own fields if you like. There is even a map with a quarry that makes concrete and other items as a download. You can download excellent modded maps like Pinecove which has tons of room to expand by placing buildings you purchase. You can produce your own silage in several different ways. There are mods that have antique tractors and farming equipment and maps of old farms you can start on if you want to go old school. There are also giant maps with industry. You can buy property and you can lower the prices of these properties by doing missions. You can do farming missions for other NPC farmers for money using their equipment and make good money. You can store your fruits and grains in silos and wait until demand is high and increase your profit.  Some mods completely change the game ""Gifts of the Caucacus"" mod has  an airplane you can hire to fertilize your fields while you ride along, A quarry, shops where you can drop off your material and get other material which in turn leads to making items you can sell elsewhere. On this map in order to do forestry you must do a quest involving finding the missing forestry equipment hidden all over the map. On this map you can also purchase factories and shops from a realtor if you raise your reputation and have a lot of cash. Tons of stuff to do! There are sonme drawbacks. Doing missions for other farmers actually pays more than raising your own crops. So if you're only in it for the money, it  spoils the game a bit. You still get a lot of satisfaction of going through all the stages of growing a final product if you farm for yourself, but all that work isn't going to make you the most money. If you're just in it to get the reward of managing a successful farm than the lucrative issues shouldn't be a problem. just do them if you need cash quickly. Maintenance fees are also somewhat of a chore as you'll find yourself selling old equipment because it costs too much too maintain. You can overcome this by purchasing things like solar panels or turbines  to effectively cancel the hassle and even cut a profit. There are small maps and large maps. There are in game mods and third party mods and all of them are easy to install if you've ever modded before or just Youtube them for instructions if you're not mod savvy. This game is a relaxing kind of game. It's a stress reliever....unless you're trying to manage 300 cows, sheep, and pigs....lol!",1535296017,1535296017,True,32,4,0.778319895267486572,0,True,False,False

The good:
You want to use tractors, plows, seeders, fertilizer, slurry tanks, and balers?  This game has that.  The mechanics of farming are done pretty well.  Though dont expect to use fungacides/pesticides as they arent in the game.  Lots of tractors and equipment.  In short, if you want to farm you can farm.

The bad:
No old tractors.  No seasons.  You must download a 3rd party mod to get either of these things.  ""Missions"" are you work for another farmer, thats it.  Cant change liters to gallons.  Crop yield isnt measured in bushels, only liters.  Tractors/equipment cost more everyday you them in maintenance fees even if you dont use them.  Game starts out at 5 times normal speed.  Cant create new animals pens, so if you want sheep/pigs/coes, there is a predetermined single spot on the map for each animal and that is it.

The ugly:
No storyline. No objectives.   After a while theres no point.  If you can imagine Skyrim with all the game mechanics minus the story, thats what this game is.  Would it really have been so hard to create a story that started with you inheriting your grand dads old farm, equipment, and bank debt that was due by a certain time or you lost the farm?

Even More ugly:
You make more money working for other farmers than if you sold the same crop on the same land yourself.  Much more.  To top it all off, you are using their equipment.  There is no point in buying land or even different tractors in the game due to this.  There is zero challenge nor is there a sense of accomplishment when buying your own equipment.

Conclusions:
The game is worth the $10 US I paid on sale.  You will have a bit of fun farming so I will still recommend the game...  but only if it is on sale.  It will not be worth more until the game devs create a story(s) and fix the all of the ugly things wrong with this game.",1535260729,1535260729,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However; as the game progressed, I started to get pretty annoyed with the counter-intuitive interfaces and some of the controller settings. (And being a pilot, I'm used to complex interfaces) 

So I thought - based on the music, choppy english translation and square unimaginative interfaces- I'll bet a ball to a cent that this game was developed by a German company... turns out it was.
So, once the game developers take some trips abroad and broaden their horizons outside of their own German Game Developer University, they will definitely become a serious competitor in their branch. The same can be said for the musicians and translators of the game; They're amazingly skilled, but unfortunately they lack the feeling.

Highly and warmly recommended, with amazing potential for the people behind the game- if they're willing to think outside the box and less by the books.

There was no real depth to the game, the physics are just plain silly, and even the “helper” AI is unreliable.  I never felt like I was working toward anything or actually managing a farm.  They start you out with three fields, three tractors, and even two trains.  Trains!  Actual trains that you own.  What beginner farmer owns his/her own TRAINS??  My point is, they start you out with way too many resources, so you never really feel like you’re starting from scratch, and anything you would work for is just to do more of the same tractor driving.

Even little things like not being penalized/fined for anything bothered me.  Driving through a neighbor’s field, knocking over stop signs, or hitting cars had no effect or consequences on the world. If I lease a piece of equipment and bang it up, I would expect to be charged.  Not the case with this game.  I could even block traffic with my trains, or cut down and log all of the trees on someone else’s property with no consequences.  These seem like weird things to complain about, but they are just examples of how nothing had meaning in this game, and it really takes away the immersion.  I should have to worry about safety and logistics of transporting goods if I’m managing my own farm. 

Now I know the game can’t get super in-depth or complex or it wouldn’t be any fun.  For example, I know fertilizer was simplified to just one generic “fertilizer” to make it easy, and that’s fine.  But the entire game was overly-simplified to the point of not being a simulation.

I wouldn’t recommend this game.",1534730218,1534730218,False,23,6,0.480599820613861084,0,True,False,False

My complaint is mainly aimed at the total lack of improvment in the landscape, I last played FS 13 and enjoyed it more for the great modding community and still do. Maps that have a rough feel to them.
I play sims because I want to be drawn into a situation where I feel Im there. I want to see dirt
and weeds and rusty old reminders of a past history.
After all, the games all about the landscape right.
Yet you will find the machines are great and the UI is simple, the modding for this game is very much alive and now their are some great maps out there too.

When I first saw this I thought: ""Farming simulator? This must be so boring!"" But I was wrong. The game was on sale and because it had positive reviews I was curious and tried it.

Well, I haven't played it in a while, but initially it entertained me for almost 100 hours, despite the fact that there is actually not much to the game. I guess if you enjoyed playing with farm toys as a kid then you will have a great time playing this game. There is lots of real machinery and equipment that you can access throughout the game and the attention to detail of the models, and the way you can use and operate the equipment is simply amazing! The graphics and lighting effects are awesome for such a game, and it runs perfectly on my little laptop at high settings [Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-7500U @ 2.7 GHZ | 8GB RAM | 2GB NVIDIA Graphics] You will probably take tonnes of screenshots!

The game also taught me a lot about farming and modern equipment in general. Highly recommended if you like farming, driving and operating farming equipment.

Seriously, the game is quite addictive, but to be fair, I find myself hooked on farming games like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon when I play them as well. There's just something fun about playing through repetitive crop cycles. 

FS17 at its core is pretty relaxed right from the get go. Albeit also a bit confusing...You'll kick off your campaign mode with a lightweight tutorial, and then bam...you're on your own. Throughout the town you'll find some additional contextual tutorials for various things which works great, but really it's up to you how to play. 

I quickly learned tending my own 4 starter fields was a bit slow, so I went ahead and worked for everyone else gaining money quickly to upgrade my own tractors and equipment significantly faster. At that point, hiring my assistants to do the majority of the work for me, turning it more of the game into a light management sim. 

Honestly, it's just a relaxing game, but it's mega repetitive if you just do the basics (drive up a row and back down another, repeat thousands of times). 

I personally haven't tapped into the massive mod community yet either, but i'm feeling the itch to see what's available (and seeing recommendations from other reviewers has piqued my interests.)

So it's a great game, and a pretty legit sim i'm guessing. Not mega robust, but the mod community seems to have the intricacies covered from what i'm hearing. Totally recommend hopping into a tractor and giving this a shot!",1531110392,1531110392,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

In the plentiful realm of ""german-everything-simulators"", the ones with the old MS Flight Simulator fonts, this is not a bad game. It has it's quirks, it's very basic compared to other sims or games in 2017, but does a good enough job. Where it really shines is with the mods, those increase the number of vehicles, maps and realism, if you want more, that is.

The number of mods in game is sufficient but you might want to search some sites around for some niche ones. In-game mod download speeds are laughable too.

The big downside in this game, the one that makes this a negative review, are paid dedicated servers. You either rent a server from a number of providers or have to buy another copy of the game to host a dedicated server. Note that this doesn't mean you can't host a game. In this day and age, a developer or publisher treating customers in this manner, with such greed, can not be excused.

Though one thing I don't like about it, are the lakes. There is no possible way to get it out unless you reset it. I do get the meaning behind it, but it's a pain when I take a corner to fast and fall into the river. Another thing is, are the quests. As if you do a harvesting quest, it will tell you to ""Return To THe Working Feild"" and such. However, this pops up when I'm trying to turn the harvester around. Though I don't have the mod that removes crop if I go over it, I am trying to play realistically. And this wouldn't fit in the real world, same with the River. Usually, you would hire a tow truck to haul it out. Overall, very realistic. One thing i would like added, are more types of vechiles. Like Hovercrafts, diffrent trains & coaches and such.

The first thing you notice when playing multiplayer is that there is ALOT of syncing, I mean ALOT.  Every time a player joins,  Instead of the player syncing with the server,  the server syncs to the new player.  Atleast it seams that way.  So everytime a player joins your game freezes for 5> seconds.  Sometimes these syncs seem to take up to a minute.  The next point I want to make is the number of ""Trolls"" in this game.  The lack of Server support by the developers has made it impossible to secure any public server.  Of course you can ban the players, but from what I understand is somehow the file doesnt save when either restarting or reseting the server.  So once you reset all those banned players can come right back in a wreck havok on your server.  One of the biggest flaws is that trolls log onto the server and move all the vehicles into the water and now you cannot play on that server until an admin gets on to reset the machinery.  If the developers of this game want to have a successful lasunch to FS19, YOU MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE MULTIPLAYER COMMUNITY!   Give the server owners a more tools to keep there server safe and enjoyable.  You need to also do something about the syncing.  It is rediculous the amount of time you pause to sync to another player joining.

They made a lot of improvements and enhancements, making the game a much more immersive and interesting experience.

Unfortunately, the multiplayer aspect is still sorely lacking in current technological capability, by still suffering from the design choice to freeze all players for a brief period whenever a new player joins the game. Lack of multiplayer server administration functionality means the game is also not well suited to public game communities, but rather a small number of friends.

Still, it is the best farming simulator out there, and is a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy the concept of various types of arable farming with machinery and a little bit of animal husbandry, especially in single player.

The modding community is quite good despite the game still not having steam workshop support, with the developer making efforts in this version to integrate mods directly into the game and their web site.

The DLC are overpriced for the content and rarely go on sale beyond minor discounts compared to most games out there, but still enjoyable if you don't mind that aspect.

The models for all vehicles and placeable objects are well designed and very detailed. Also the in-game settings are very useful. It covers everything from fuel consumption, to plant growth, to volume levels and even to whether you want there to be cars on the road.

What also makes this game so good is the ability to easily mod it. Mods for this game are easily obtained and easy to add. Also, because a lot of the game settings are stored in xml files, it is easy to alter a map, a vehicle, or placeable. This can be useful as you can give yourself as much money as you want (if you are wanting a map just to experiment with) or if you want to change how much a tipper, a bucket or a tanker can hold.

Just because you can do this, you don't have to and you can just play the game as it is. This is what makes it great for players who are looking for realism or players who are not to interested in realism and just want to play to see how crazy you can get it.

However, a small glitch I have noticed is the height your character is at can randomly change. While this may not sound to major, it means you sometimes can't cut down a tree lower than you usually would and sometimes it stops you going though doorways.

Nobody is trying to kill you and you are not trying to kill anyone.  It's just you, your animals, tractors, and awesome equipment that you had no idea existed.  I have learned an awful lot about the agriculture busniness. Just because of this game I was searching google for how farmers do this in real life and to my surprise the equipement, precision, and science is immence. This game does have a large learning curve and it does not hold your hand. You are free to do whatever you want with little to no consequences.  Now here's the thing.  99% of the player base do not play vanilla. They're using community created mods and maps.  The FS community has created brilliant mods that can make the game more realistic and challenging if you so wish or plough with the same tractor your grandpa had when you were a kid. Oh the nastalga and memories. GIANTS has made a game that people can easily get into, but that's where it falls short. It's not a simulator and it is not realistic at all.

VANILLA FARMING SIMULATOR 17

No Seasons
No Breakdowns or Repairs
No Damage Simulations
No Bankruptcy - infinite negative bank balance
No weeds
No crop destruction if you drive through a germinating field.
No pests
No animal diseases or deaths
No Drought
No Floods
Straw, Hay, and Grass do not rot
Fields are flat.
Perfect Square fields
Tracters drive like they're on asphalt. Even in a bumpy muddy and ploughed field.
Your tires don't even get dirty like they should.
Terrible AI that only works in a straight line, which is why the fields are either square or rectangular.
Crappy phyiscs engine, which makes manual pallet and bale work tedious.
You're the ghost in the town and people don't notice you
Traffic gets in your way and won't move. They just honk their horn in anger. So you save, exit, reload your save and turn traffic off. The annoyance is gone. Now it's a ghost town.

MODDED FARMING SIMULATOR 17

Seasons Mod - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter - You must plan and develope your farm to prepare for the coming seasons, weather forcast, and animals, which will die if you don't take care of them.  Geological weather data. Perform regular maintanence on your vehichles or inpede a high penalty cost. Snow, rain, hail and crops will die if planted in the wrong seasons and they won't even germinate if the soil tempture is too low.

GPS Mod - Sophisticated GPS System, which the real modern tractors have. The tractor will lock the front wheels to the coordinates of the hud. It's a really good option to use if you want to do a neat and tidy job yourself.

CoursePlay 5 - AI actually works in all field shapes. Not just squares and rectangles. You can completely automate your farm when it becomes too large for a one man team. There's even a handy manual online.

AutoCombine - Similar to courseplay, but only works for field work. Courseplay is better.

Crop Destruction - you can no longer drive though your crops without destorying them.

Ground Response - Your tractor is no longer driving on asphalt, but a ploughed bumpy field.

Drive Control - Oh? Your tractor is slipping now because of the ground response? Use this for 4WD and differential locks.

Tire Dirt - Your tires actually get dirty in the field.

ProSeed - Creates tram lines, which prevents your tires from destorying the crop and it works well with crop destruction mod and you can even turn off 1/2 of the seeder to make sure the tram lines are perfectly placed down withthe same width of your fertlizer spreader or sprayor, just like they do in real life.

Tons of high quality tractors to choose from. 
- FS15 No Fendt. MODS Fendt's galore. John Deere.
- FS17 Fendt. MODS John Deere. I especially love the R7 mod by TM. I seem to recall a tweet from GIANTS about acquiring the rights for John Deere tractors for FS19.

The physics eh? Hard to put pallets and bales on your trailer? It's the engines fault. Install the mod that improves it, albeit only marginally, or just use a trailer with an Autoload script that will put all the bales and pallets perfectly stacked and alligned on the trailer for you. 1 hour job done in seconds!

Add more crop types. Apple orchard, oranges, cherries etc. 

Most importantly. Waaaaaayy better maps!! Sandy Bay17, Chellington, The West Coast, Churn! Challenging terrain and field shapes. Bah just try and use GIANTS AI with those fields.

Add more animals. - which reminds me
- FS15 Chickens, Sheep, Cows ---> MOD Pigs and slaughter houses.
- FS17 Chickens, Sheep, Cows, Pigs. Sell your cows and pigs ---> MOD Horses
- Confirmed FS19 Chickens, Sheep, Cows, Pigs, Horses ---> MOD Pikachu?  I'd like to care for a pikachu.

You can go on Youtube for tutorials on these mods. It's very easy.

GIANTS is outsourcing talent from across the world and paying the mod authors for every download their mod gets.  Your mod will only be entered into the ModHub after it passes the lengthy testing phase by GIANTS and it must be rated 4 stars or more by the user base in order to get paid.  Soybeans and Sugarcane? You could add those crops, tools, and equipment to harvest it before with a mod in FS15 and now its here officially in 17. This is what GIANTS and other big name software companies, like Bethesda, are doing.  Since the mod community does their job for them? There is next to no innovation each release to GIANTS Editor and their game engine since 2007. What kind of improvements should we expect for FS19?

""High Dynamic Range Rendering allows us to display the complete spectrum of colors at the same time, the added Bloom will make light irradiation much more realistic, thanks to SSAO all objects in the game now cast their own shadows, which will be realistically cast thanks to the new Light Scattering technique. The sun on the new dynamic sky now serves as a light source and the clouds, which are now voxel-based 3D objects, reflect the light absolutely realistically.""

 Oh. Eye candy and fluff. HDR, which is a 1984 technique they can do on their lunch break and SSAO, which was developed in 2007 by Crytek. Litterly nothing we have seen before, but it is an improvement to their engine. It really shows how behind and old their engine is in a niche market. I'm tired of the 2D field textures, since 2007, that try real hard to look 3D. I'll be waiting till a mod author comes up with that idea.

This game has everything for every type of player. I myself play more on the realism side and add all the realistic enhancing mods like Seasons, which changes the base game drastically to the point it's not the same game anymore that GIANTS envisioned. Remember that when you read these reviews and keep downloading these mods to support the mod authors.",1529470582,1529478234,True,130,9,0.899809300899505615,3,True,False,False

At first, I bought the game to play with a friend of mine, didn't like it and refunded it. Bought it back again and kept onto it (because I had over 2 hours into it), I tried to play the game for a bit, got myself some mods and from time to time I did a solo game. On just this past week did I get back into it because I got other friend to buy it and play it. We enjoy it, we've messed around with front loaders and big tractors even to the point where we were reenacting the Cars scene where Mater and McQueen wake up those big tractors at night. We started with easy difficulty (since we weren't wanting a difficult experience) and it was a good starting point for us.

Honestly, if you are wanting an experience like this right now, buy this game (don't ask me about dlc because I haven't tested any), but if you can wait a little longer, wait for Farming Simulator 19, it will be a bit more expensive for sure, but more people will transition to that as well (because it is one of those games).",1528797754,1528797754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm only 4 hours in, and i've barely scratched the surface. But the one thing that is already apparent with this title, is that it does exactly what ETS2 and ATS do to me: It takes away my ability to decide how long I play it for. My last session was meant to be an hour, and it quickly became three.

You don't sit down with the intention of spending all day/night on it, but be warned, the game takes what it wants from you. Don't believe me? Buy the game and tell me how long it takes you to cancel those not-so-important-after-all family plans because you have crops to harvest. That planned weekend away with your other half? Forget it. You have pigs to feed and new land to buy. And that job interview you had booked for next week? Not happening. Stocking up your grain silos and cleaning your tractor ready for the next day's work will be far more important to you. This game has the potential to destroy friendships and relationships!

On a serious note, I have deliberately delayed buying this game since it's release. Fact is, I never intended to buy it at all. ""Ploughing fields and cleaning up animal waste. Who could be addicted to such a game?"" I thought. ""Sounds boring!""

**spends around 900hrs hauling different loads from city to city in ETS2 and ATS**

Who am I to call it boring?

Recently i've been thinking more and more about buying it, so I added it to my wishlist about 6 weeks ago. This morning, I took the plunge and bought it. Worth it? Ohhh yessss!!

It turns out I had massively underestimated this game. Truthfully, I only decided to buy it on the recommendation of a family member who's been playing it for some time. But I finally understand what all the hype is about. I get why there are so many raving reviews.

This title has so much to offer. It's not just about driving tractors and harvesting crops. There's a whole economy to manage too, workers to hire, money to make, and new vehicles and equipment to buy and sell. Furthermore, there's a whole plethora of mods available!

The graphics are beautiful and the sounds are awesome, from the birds singing in the trees, to machinery clunking away in the background. The environment has been well thought out, and there's plenty to keep you busy. Like any great game, it's all too easy to loose track of time as you become totally immersed.

There is a lot of stuff to get used to, so don't expect to be making a success of things when you first get started. I highly recommend going through the tutorials! These will be of huge benefit to you when you start the career mode, as you'll quickly discover that you don't start out with all of the equipment that you really need, so you have to either budget for new equipment or make the best of what you DO have for the time being.

The sheer number of controls and functions is a real mindbender, but it all adds to the experience. I did find that the default controls setup was a bit clumsy and frustrating, so I spent a lot of time remapping them to work with my aging Logitech G25. I believe this title can also be played in VR, which is great news to me as an Oculus owner! I haven't tried it yet though. The TrackIR seems to be doing the job well enough on it's own for the time being. Another useful tool in my opinion, since you often need to be looking both ahead and behind your vehicle while working with some of the equipment.

If you have a wheel/pedals, you WILL want to use them with this game. I can't see the likes of an Xbox controller offering anywhere near the level of functionality and fingertip control that you really need. I know people are getting by just fine with a gamepad, but if you have a controller which offers far more buttons and axes, use it.

This review is one of MANY which can't recommend the game enough. No review will ever do the game justice.

Speaking of reviews, I'm writing this during a coffee break, and I have a field that needs my attention!

Buy it! You won't be disappointed!",1524076280,1524076280,True,12,2,0.639673769474029541,0,True,False,False

I wish i could destroy my tractors with the train to collect insurance, or burn down my barns or house to get new ones.

I think if they add cops, and going to jail that the game would be even better.  I also think that they should add some stunt races, like the type of stuff where I am able to really prove that my Case IH truly is faster than a Deutz tractor.  One other thing I suggest is the ability to take some of my animals for walks, because I feel bad that they are stuck in a fence the entire time.

It is challenging to the newcomer like me, but if you invest in the tutorials and help menus, you will learn as you go and enjoy it. However, I am very addicted so far and I will list below why:

Side note: There are some tutorials out there on how to make tons of money right off the bat with the game. Usually it involves selling everything you own, maxing out your loan, and installing solar panels, then leaving your system on for 3 solid real time days......I recommend not doing that, as IF you follow the basics of the game, such as farming multiple crop types, fertilizing, and only selling harvests when prices are high, you will make plenty of money and it will be YOUR hard earned work and rewards, not an exploit. 

Here's what I like about the game:
- Multiple ways to make money, farming numerous types of crop, harvesting lumber, working other farmers fields for really good pay, installing money generating placeables on your farm, etc.
 
- Very technical game with attention to detail and the graphics and modelling matches that. If you do not like simulation games or have some hatred of farmers, then you won't like this game.

- Steep learning curve but not overwhelming, just follow the tutorials and help menus, and work your way up to new crops and new machines.

- The financial system is fairly simple yet robust, and really does well to make you feel like YOU OWN each piece of equipment with your hard work and savings. You have a list of various buyers for your crops, that list is color coded to prices (demand) that are bad, neutral, good, and really good (high demand). You can borrow up to $300K in loans, which do not have any time limit to pay them back, but you are charged interest each day until you do. 

-This game runs VERY well even on full graphics. The graphics are very good, and the game runs super smooth even though I have an older gaming PC. 

- I have not yet found any glitches or bugs, again it runs smooth. 

- A LOT of control over your difficulty. You can choose Easy Medium or Hard as usual, but you get further control over, how often you have to fertilize crops, whether or not your crops whither and so on. This tweaking really lets you play to your play style and skill level (aka, I'm a noob).

- There's a lot more to do than ""just farming"" you can purchase forklifts, logging equipment, semi-trucks/trailers, and A TON more. This game is packed with A LOT of really cool vehicles that make your life easier and give you variety in what to do.  

- I like that you can hire AI helpers (good AI with a few hiccups) to take over various time consuming tasks while you do other stuff. Using them properly is the absolute key to success when farming by yourself in a time efficient manner. 

- You have hands on control of your farming output from start to finish. I love the fact that you decide what crops go in what field, you put work into increasing the yield of those crops, harvesting those crops, storing those crops in your silos, and eventually loading up those crops into a trailer and hauling them with your pickup to sell to a vendor. From start to finish you get to be involved in it all, or have AI workers help where needed. 

- MOD SUPPORT!

- You get hundreds of hours of game-play from a game that costs $35 full retail. 

Things I don't like:
- The more your vehicles/equipment age, the more they cost per day to keep, I feel this happens a bit too fast. This is deducted from you at midnight of each day, going into the thousands per day or more. There is no way to remedy this other than selling off the old rig (for next to nothing) and purchasing a new one (which could be A LOT of money). This really cuts into your bottom dollar, but is also realistic in managing your overall farm. So it's a positive if you like realism, but a steep learning curve for new players.

- The store, which you purchase all of your equipment and supplies, is REALLY far from your farm, making trips there to pick up a new header for your combine (which travels 14 MPH) a real chore. I would have liked to see this store closer. You can however purchase trailers and such to transport pallets of fertilizer and seeds that you buy, and that's fun. You can fast travel to this store by your self (no vehicle with you), but if you need a vehicle to pick up your purchase, you have to drive that vehicle over there and back again, which sucks if it goes 14 mph....

- The controls on the faster vehicles such as your pickup, are quite unrealistic and if you're going fast, it's really easy to spin out. However it is manageable and once you get the hang of it it's not a big deal. 

Overall, this game is really fun, I recommend it to anyone who is open minded about their games, who likes technical/simulation games, or who enjoys management type games where you have a lot of investment into what you own in the game and how well your business does. I feel that Farming Simulator 2017 does this very well, it makes you put stock into the game and feel like you have ownership over your success and the things you own.",1494479627,1523433396,True,20,2,0.734873175621032715,1,True,False,False

Then the game doesn't work, I have entire maps and all equipment go missing.  On FS17 at the end of Mar everything was going good all my maps were working just fine.  Then all of the sudden I have to re-download the game and just before this happened there was an update from Steam.  
On this game they use what is called course play where u ""hire a worker"" to play plant etc. .  U tell the worker what to do and what course to take across the fields and it shows the start and then the paths/waypoints as to where go and they are visible until the worker done with its job at the stop waypoint.  AFTER the latest update the waypoints are no longer visible just the start and stop waypoints only.  Plus  on some maps the plows don't plow they plant something green i assume is grass.  
I do NOT recommend steam for this game as Steam assumes the game publishers are at fault when clearly in this example the updates didn't mesh I am saying steam is the culprit here.  
Now for the sixth on this game I have cleared all of my mods deleted the game from steam and reinstalled in times previous to this on FS13 and 15 thru steam I have had to do this and the game worked fine after that but it gets annoyign to have to start all over again.

If you look at my play times for each game in the series going back to FS2009, you'll notice that I have 1000s of hours invested in them. I just couldn't possibly give a negative review based on this very fact alone.

Are the games, including FS2017, perfect? No, of course not. We all have things we'd like to see changed or added to the games, but that would be an impossible undertaking by the designers at Giants Software.

In any case, what really makes these games amazing? The community of modders. Many players create top quality maps, equipment, and even complete redesigns of the game by adding countless new crops, animals, production, and manufacturing possibilities that surpass the base game.

I've played most of the farming simulator type games available, and for me, the Giants FS series can't be beat at the moment. They have been the King of farming simulators for quite a few years. I also have a hard time picking just one of Giants FS games because they each are different, as in each offer something not available in the other games.

TLDR: It's a great farming simulator title, and has a large mod community that keeps the game enjoyable, even after 1000s of hours if you so incline to do.

It might not be as exotic as space travel, but it’s still a form of escapism (unless you happen to be a farmer), and Farming Simulator 17 looks to bring you the best wheat growing/sheep dipping/manure spreading experience available.

Farming Simulator 17 is a slow burn. Don’t jump into it expecting to get to grips with the game straight away, there is a lot to learn. From crop management to animal husbandry, this game is dense. There are a few tutorials that can be selected from the start, but if you’re new to the series, you’re bound to be a bit daunted. Even something as simple digging up a field requires a decent level of understanding of how tractors and their attachments work.

Having said that, you’ve got the time to learn it all, because Farming Simulator 17 is a leisurely game. Unless you play it on the hardest difficulty, where crops deteriorate if you don’t harvest them in time, you can go at your own pace, and have the freedom to do whatever you want. The game almost becomes zen-like when you take on a job. It’s not uncommon to have to spend 40 minutes harvesting crops in a field. That’s 40 real time minutes of going backwards and forwards across the same few hectares, just driving your tractor and turning around when you get to the end. Whether or not that appeals is key to what you’ll get out of the game, because while there are plenty of different activities, they all get repetitive after a short time. There’s also a basketball court in town if you fancy shooting some hoops, something we all know farmers are famous for.

Graphically it’s inoffensive, but you’d struggle to call it pretty. It’s the best looking Farming Simulator title yet, but honestly that was a low bar to start with. It introduces some new features to the series, such as being able to play as a female character, and there are new crops to tackle too. If you’re getting hot under the collar about the prospect of growing your own field of soya beans, then you already know that this is a game for you.

Since January 2018 Masterbrain now released Cattle and Crops and FS is definitely no match, eventhough this game is very fun and playable it lacks physics, dynamics and realism you can find in Cattle and Crops. Its heavily based on repetition and each new game doesn't bring much change, leave this one behind and move on the Cattle and Crops, despite the fact it's still 'early acces' it's definitelty worth your money, more updates will follow and it will crush Giants software even more than it already does.

But I don't care about that - It's a great fun game/arcade sim with plenty to do, and loads of mods - tractors and implements of all ages and maps to suit all tastes. 
I worked on a farm in the Broxton area many years ago, and this game really takes me back to the feel of real farming. The graphic models of Giants' tractors and all equipment are superb, so mods are not essential, but the many mods on offer definitely add to the game.
The default game is a bit simplified, so it can appeal to all ages, but still it is good enough to feel like some real farming, and if you want more realism, there are plenty of third party mods that increase the realism, Seasons being the first one that comes to mind.
If you're tired of/not a fan of fast paced shooters, and want a more relaxed challenge, then this is a great change of pace.

Many of the script mods are now part of the game. Most of my favorite tractor mods are part of the game. I find that when Giants make a tractor it is generally more polished. The field textures are better than any of the modded textures I've found so far. The improvements to the feel of driving equipment are great. One aspect of the game that really shocked me is the improvements in sound. They have also managed to improve the quality and performance of the graphics at the same time. The game performs flawlessly with all graphics settings on max at 4k resolution with every nvidia option set to highest quality. The level of configurability is another great feature of this new version.

Why the difference? Because FS 17 is a near carbon copy of 15, the AI is actually worse, the differences are trivial and the mechanics are arbitrary and stupid. Don't get me wrong, it's not that the game isn't fun. It's that it barely qualifies as a different game from 15. It even shares a map from 15, giving the player only ONE new map in the base game, for a grand total of two maps. If you want more than that you have to buy the platinum expansion for a whopping one more. This could've just as easily been an expansion pack for FS15 as a new game.

It's also not a simulator by any stretch of the imagination. It's one gigantic, arcadey, interactive commercial for the agricultural equipment industry and nothing more.

There are loads of different things to do, and loads of kit to buy which makes the initial learning curve fairly steep but utube will help.

When it comes to gameplay, there are some jobs that you have to do yourself but the normal crop based jobs (cultivating, sowing, fertilizing and harvesting) can be delegated to AI workers which means you don't have to drive up and down the fields if you don't want to. If like me, you like business sims then it's great not having to always do those jobs. 

One minor criticism I have, on normal difficulty there is a prefectly legitimate way to make tons of money very easily which seems a little bit unrealistic. Personally once I found out about it I decided not to use it, and it may not be possible on hard difficulty but you can use it or not depending on your preference I guess.

Overall I'm really enjoying it and would recommend to any who likes the idea.

I have to say that the gameplay itself isn't really captivating and can feel a little tedious at times (especially on the hardest difficulty where it can be a bit of a grind). I most of the time multi-task so I'll be watching TV or a film whilst playing this game but I think the thing that keeps me engaged is the financial aspect. 

It's mainly building up my finances and buying bigger more powerful machines and increasing my efficiency or investing in forrestry or animal husbandry that keeps working the same fields over and over worthy of my time.

Whilst there are some quirks with the game (e.g. graphics and some of the mechanics like pallet forks) overall it's very comprehensive and it feels to me (a layman) that it has captured all the aspects a farmer might encounter and for that reason I feel it's more simulator than game.

And as always the work of the dedicated modding community elevates the status and playability of the title and the sandbox nature of the game also gives the freedom to try out mods that have nothing or everything to do with farming.

Definitely reccommend to those who don't need a game to be constantly stimulating and don't recommend for those who can't handle relaxing quiet gameplay.",1521068353,1521068453,True,28,3,0.748170018196105957,0,True,False,False

I bought FS 11 waaay back in 2012 i think, it was good fun. but Shooters had me at that time, so i forgot about it again. I first caught my eye again when FS17 came out. i bought it for the Xbox One first, And i loved it. i played it constantly. The mod support wasn't as great as it is on the PC but it was sufficient.
I then bought myself a real ""gamer"" PC, and bought it for the PC. and it almost felt like a whole new game again. 60 FPS, Great mod support, support for controllers and other joysticks.
I never thought i would be this interested in tractors and other agricultural machinery after playing this game.

Pro's
[list]
    [*] Multiplayer support is offered in game or via the purchase of dedicated servers
    [*] Of all the Farming Simulator's it has the greatest variety of vehicles
    [*] Very strong modding community which produce great mods for the game
[/list]

Con's:
[list]
    [*] Outdated game engine when released, especially when compared to Farming Simulator 2015
    [*] Attention to detail - raining inside, no seasons, ground physics when wet, etc
    [*] Weak DLC's compared to Farming Simulator 2015- KUHN Pack DLC is the only one worth purchasing

Pros:
Very good graphics
Pretty good texture quality 
Even on a Mac running a VM (Virtual Machine) ran decently smooth on lowest settings
Will run on a computer with a potato for a graphics card
Very easy and safe to install mods
Will be fun for lots of people (Depending on your point of veiw)
Very addicting
Cons:
AI is one of my least favorite AI's ever next to an iPad game. Texture quality on them is fine, but, if you hit them, you will expeirience one of the most unrealistic crash ever. It doesn't have crash physics, but, still, when you hit them, you A.) Stop dead in your tracks B.) Go flying or C.) Drive right over them and flip.
Will not autosave
Can have random spikes of lag (on intense graphics)
Acceleration and braking is unrealistic
Can get frustrating if you've had long day and it crashes.

things id like to see in future in the base game 
repairs to stuff like tractors and to thing like fencing to keep the animals in 
more stuff to do with the animals shearing the animals right time of year
been able to move animals from fields the uncut fields and they eat the grass there

Let me start off by setting the tone.

I've played since FS11 and despite the radical inclusion of forestry in FS15, which I enjoyed very much, I was still very bitter towards GIANTS and their progress from 11 to 15. I felt their added features lacking, their improvements lacking and overall vision or direction absent. Their DLCs quite often were obvious money grabs, rather than any real addition to a player's farming strategy. 

Odds are, they were a small but up and coming software development team which accomplished what they could, considering they were also creating smaller versions of the game for the Android and iOS platforms. Maybe they were spread too thin.

This year, they release FS17 with a $45 price tag, up from $29 in the past and I couldn't help but facepalm myself. I sarcastically thought, ""Let me guess, we'll have MORE TRACTORS"" as a way to justify the new cost.

24 literal gameplay hours into it, and I have to say, it has caught up to most of my expectations. Kudos for bringing this game up to speed and making it almost worth the $45. It's about time. 

The game mechanics haven't changed a whole lot. It seems like midway through FS15, before they fleshed out all the bugs, they cloned it and started making FS17. This would explain a lot of the bugs that were resolved late in FS15 showing up in FS17. Currently, the ""jitter bug"" prevents me from doing forestry unless I use autoload trailer mods. 

So what's the deal?

Missions have changed. Previously we had delivery and mowing missions. I didn't mind the delivery ones, but they were sorta boring. The mowing missions I enjoyed. They're now gone, which I don't think is right. They should come back and with more variety. 

Now, we have missions where we are maintaining other farmer's fields. Thing is, you can't hire anyone to do it. You have to do it yourself. I would prefer to be able to hire, even if it meant it would cut into my profit.

There are a few more crops, 1 more live stock (pigs), chickens haven't changed and lots of tractors. There are even two useless trains. Well, useless on the Goldcrest Valley map. Two little loops around the center of the map. Regardless, it will make for great maps by the modders. Goldcrest Valley is an awful map. How is it that modders make better maps?

Despite my gripes... I'm really addicted to this game.

And with the $45 price tag and $19 DLCs... they'd better be making a phenomenal FS2019.",1477552274,1516505885,True,53,4,0.780025303363800049,2,True,False,False

By studying the map I’d already deduced that my prize was resting on top of a lawyer’s office, but I had no idea how to access the roof as climbing nearby trash cans and awnings proved utterly fruitless. Finally I managed to reach the top of the building by scurrying up a nearby flagpole and making a desperate leap of faith, thereby securing my precious golden quarry. Satisfied with my accomplishments for the evening, I retreated to the nearby park to shoot some hoops.

If all of this sounds far-fetched for a game that calls itself Farming Simulator 17, please, read on.

The fact is that Giants Software’s latest agricultural undertaking is equal parts straight-faced management sim and delirious open-world petri dish. If you choose to ignore the latter and focus only on the serious aspect of the farming business, this option is definitely there for you. But you’re also missing out on some of the wonderfully quirky charms this game has to offer.

Let’s discuss the farming first, as it is obviously the core of the Farming Simulator 17 experience. As a burgeoning farm owner, it is your initial responsibility to cultivate, sow, fertilize and harvest your fields on a routine basis. You sell your goods for profit and the cycle begins anew. From there, things become much more complicated. The amount of tasks initially thrown your way — not to mention choosing the appropriate equipment to complete these tasks — can be daunting at first. Thankfully there are adequate in-game tutorials that should be completed before proceeding further in the game, especially if you don’t know seed from slurry. Once you settle into your rural groove and find your way around, there comes that delightfully satisfying rhythm that only the best of management sims can provide. More than any other game in the genre, FS 17 provides a peaceful, zen-like aspect that constantly propels you to keep playing. Make no mistake: If you’ve ever considered playing a farm sim, this is the one you’ll want to play.

New to FS 17 is mod support for consoles, which lends a whole new level of value and replayability. New vehicles, new equipment, and even entirely new maps are available, and while the console mods are no match for what's available on PC, it’s still an incredible boon for XB1 and PS4 players. If you find yourself tiring of playing on either of the two default maps, you’ve got numerous player creations to choose from, with more on the way.

Another welcome new feature is Missions, which allow you to perform basic labor for other local farmers in exchange for cold, hard cash. If managing your own farm is too intimidating, you can simply drive around the map and perform these Missions, which serve to accomplish several goals; 1) provide insight on the various aspects of crop farming routines; 2) introduce various equipment and their uses; 3) get in a farmer’s good graces so that you can eventually purchase their property at a lower value; 4) earn some cold, hard cash. I found myself performing dozens of Missions before tending to my own farm, so that by the time I got started on business proper I felt as though I had a firm grasp on things.

Crop raising isn’t the sole extent of your responsibilities, there’s animal husbandry as well. Cows, chickens, sheep and pigs are all a part of the process, adding another layer of depth and complexity to farm management. Raising animals produces sellable product as well as the fertilizer required to nourish your crops, making this an important piece of the puzzle. And for all of you aspiring lumberjacks out there, forestry is also an option. Every new facet of the farming experience requires equally new equipment, which you’ll have to either buy or rent from the local dealer then learn how to implement. There are several dozen licensed equipment manufacturers in the game as well as hundreds of in-game and modded tools and vehicles to choose from. At some point you’ll find yourself so busy that you’ll need to hire workers to aid you with your daily tasks. Eventually you’ll end up commandeering freight trains to transport your goods, another great addition to the series. Indeed, this agri-sim is brimming with options.

As you may have deduced, a farmer’s life can be a complex one. If the above was all there was to Farming Simulator 17, it would already be an easy recommendation. But there’s so, so much more. Intentionally or not, the virtual world that your farmer resides in — and indeed your farmer himself — are flawed in ways that border on Goat Simulator-esque self-parody. For example, the simple act of driving a vehicle — a game mechanic that we’ve expected some degree of precision from for at least a decade now — is inexplicably touchy and borderline uncontrollable at high speeds. When you do inevitably wreck your trusty ol' pickup, you’ll find a distinct lack of real-world physics, damage modeling or in-game reaction. This means that you can plow over pedestrians without fear of reprisal, and that crashing into a tree or a brick wall at top speed is basically the same as braking really, really hard. The vehicular shenanigans don’t end there, park your tractor in the middle of a busy street and traffic will pile up quickly, even though there is an open lane available for your fellow motorists to easily get around you.

You create your in-game farmer avatar by choosing your gender and the color of flannel shirt you want to wear inside your overalls (for males). Further customization may be a moot point as your farmer is rarely seen, he is usually in a vehicle and is always in first-person when outside the vehicle. Still, it would have been nice to offer some officially licensed apparel to accompany the dozens of licenses included in the game. Would I love my farmer to rock a Case IH trucker cap? Of course! Then again, this is Farming Simulator we're talking about and not a rural fashion show.

As it turns out, your farmer is a Superman of sorts. He requires no food, no drink, and no sleep. He can get involved in bone-crushing high-speed collisions or fall from the greatest of heights without obtaining as much as a flesh wound. He can even walk on water, which incidentally serves to make this game a passable Jesus sim. In a nutshell your farmer is invincible, there’s nothing in this digital landscape which can do him harm. This is probably intentional as the focus is supposed to be on practical farm management as opposed to whatever inspired jackassery you may be plotting whenever you’re not busy cultivating oilseed radish. In any case, it does makes for some hilarious episodes should you ever grow bored with life on the ranch.

And then there’s the gold. You see, many maps are littered with gold nuggets, which serve as a scavenger hunt type of mini-game with a decent amount of reward. These nuggets are quite shiny and far easier to locate than you might imagine (find the first 10 and you’ll see what I mean), they are usually found in another farmer’s backyard or other blatantly obvious hiding spots. This led me to question whether every other person in Goldcrest Valley was legally blind or if I was trespassing and stealing from them. Perhaps both.

Despite the comical lack of attention to in-world detail, Farming Simulator 17 succeeds on every account that it aspires to. It is an incredibly deep management sim which sheds light on a profession that quite honestly, more people need to be educated about. A farmer’s life can be a difficult one, and this game does shed a small amount of light on what these hard-working folk go through day-in and day-out just to put food on our tables. Farmers are real-life everyday heroes, just don’t expect them to be very good at basketball.",1516382378,1516394373,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
Trust me I am not really into farming, I like technology, but I do like a good simulation and that is what we have here.

I bought this title because another friend owned it too and we both bought it to support the Swiss-developer behind it, since we both think it is great our small country makes cool games too.
 
[b]Overview[/b]
Ever wondered how it is to be a farmer? Me neither, but I gave it a try and was surprised by the depth of gameplay you find here.

You basically start off on your farm with some equipment to start with.
Then you do reap your crops and plant them again, you will have to manage your finances by selling your produce at good prices to invest in better equipment to improve the daily work.

[b]Rating[/b]
8/10 for regular Gamers
9/10 for the Farmers who cannot get enough and want to have even better equipment as in RL :)

[b]The highlights[/b]
[list]
[*] Detailed Maps
[*] Many vehicle's and utilities to invest in
[*] Several different crops
[*] Nice graphics
[/list]

[b]The lowlights[/b]
[list]
[*] Gameplay tends to get repetitive (grindy), but until then you spent many hours
[/list]

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
+Yes!
You can play online with your friends and manage a Farm together.
It is a lot of fun to co-ordinate together or do fun/stupid stuff instead.
Played this with 2 friends and each of us had a speciality

[b]Mods[/b]
+Yes!
You can find mods on the Game-Homepage or from other sites on the internet.
The mods range from new equipment, new Maps, UI or helpers for your daily business.
Installation is basically copy the zip into the right directory, not to complicated.

[b]Microtransactions/DLC[/b]
There are no microtransactions.
The developer offers additional content as DLC, you decide if it is worth it or not.

[b]Summary[/b]
I honestly started to appreciate the job of a farmer even more after playing this game.
It seriously gives you a different experience of the produce you tend to buy simply at the grocery-store.

The big list of equipment gives you plenty goals to set yourself and grow your farm further and further.
This game is a well-done simulation and you should give it a try even if hard-core gamers might think this one seems casual.

The possibility to expand your game with many mods is also a big plus.

I highly recommend this game and as much as the competition is trying, they still come nowhere near FS17, or even FS15. I would like to see insecticides and more content as it all moves along, and also please get sugarcane into the editor Giants.

Well, it was on sale and I have always been a gear head and like trucks/tractors/machinery so I pulled the trigger and let me tell you its far from my first expectations. First off, this game is what you make it. If you want to farm every inch of dirt you own, the game allows you to do that. If you find that tedious (like me), you can hire out the work to your farm hands and focus on managing the farm. 

So, if you like: 
-Driving highly detailed tractors and machinery.
-Sandbox and Simulation games.
-Being in charge of a buisness / managing a company.
-Casual gameplay that holds your attention but allows you to pause/save/take a break at any time.
Than this game is for you.

2)  You can no longer do jobs on other farms for money.  So if I have my three fields growing, then my friends are just sitting there or playing ""tractor joust"" or something.  That's only fun for so long.

So while I liked running around in Co-op, it ended up seemingly totally pointless.  If just the host gets rewards, then why bother?  I'd rather play something where the visitors at least get something for helping me.  So really this game is only good for single player, which gets boring pretty quick without friends.  So I can't recommend it unless your looking for just single player.  I will say that at least it does have a good choice of difficulties, which most games don't.",1514834930,1514834930,False,5,2,0.495061486959457397,2,True,False,False

My only gripe is the lack of peril. There's limited risk and no pressure. You'll be able to think of dozens of problems farmers may face and sadly you won't see any. The harder difficulty presents financial challenge but from what I've play on normal so far, I can't imagine ever LOSING my farm somehow. That being said, there are mods to add challenges.

2) I've always been a community organizer and so knew that this game is far better when played with other people.  Sure I'm a nerd because I game so much, and play D&D, but it blew me away how much I enjoyed FS17.  Not something I ever thought I'd like.  I think what pulled me in is the fact that it isn't scripted.  There is no ""What should i do next"" hand holding.  It's an open-ended relaxing game where you get to drive big awesome machines.  At my prime I was spending every evening playing FS17 when running the server for several hours.  When the server was very popular I would easily spend 3-4 hours a night playing.  Much longer on the weekends.

3) Our server was a little more relaxed then other multiplayer servers.  We aimed to have a ""community"" as opposed to a ""simulation"" of farming.  We recognized we were all gamers.  We would have community events in game and invite everyone to join.  Everyone took a round of shots while we drove trucks around town doing deliveries.  Any time someone crashed we wouldn't ""reset"" the vehicles, we had to go get tow bars and pull them out.  Made for lots of laughs.  We switched maps 4-5 times during the time I hosted the server.  Each map filled a different need and made by excellent map makers in the community like Stevie and Dajnet.  Most recently we were on Pleasant Valley v3.1, a map by Dajnet.  It is an amazing map and allowed us to support several more players on our server as the map alone has 6 different standalone farms.

The only thing I noticed with this game as opposed to other communities I've created in other games is the turnover rate is very high.  People don't stick around FS17 as much as other communities.  They get anxious to try new maps, or other games, or play more casually.  Not as many 'gamers' play FS17 but there were a handful.

4) Recommended to be heavily modded.  The vanilla version of the game is not designed very well when it comes to multiplayer.  The game really comes alive and fun when you start installing mods.  Very unique maps with new machines, new equipment and tractors, new manufacturing features.  The vanilla game gets repetitive and boring very quickly.  But Mods make it a much better experience with thousands of activities to do, depending on your combination of maps and mods.

In addition, I played for several months with mouse and Keyboard but the game felt new again after I purchased a Wheel, pedals, and a Joystick.

5)Other servers that are legitimately organized seem to be a lot different.  Everyone has an opinion when they transfer from an old server, ""my server used to do it this way..."".  So there is a lot of variation.  Some servers don't care about realism so they will mod their machines to go ridiculously fast, or hold way too much materials.  Other servers have TOO MUCH realism in my opinion, and don't allow players to drive anywhere but on the roads with certain vehicles.  We were somewhere in between.  The only thing I wish Giants would improve would be their multiplayer features.  It was really difficult to keep an ongoing server going with limited access to how in game funds work.  Lots of mods helped fix this. 

As a result, I know several servers even ran the game with a bunch of spreadsheets, and tracked their expenses out of game.  I did that for too long in EVE online that when I switched to FS17 I wanted a much more casual experience.  So we made it work on our server with mods, even though it wasn't perfect.

What can I say about this game? Its def farming 101 if you know nothing about farming, but its def the basics of farming. I'm a bit disappointed in a game that calls itself a simulator and boasts detail of real trucks and other stuff but yet doesn't really care about anything like ground nutrient levels or the such. How about a soil sampling system that will allow you to monitor the PH levels or tell you how much bacteria is in the soil? I mean simple stuff like basic nutrient levels of your soils are key to whether or not your crops should grow.

To me this game feels more like an advertising platform for the various agricultural companies and their equipment than an ACTUAL farm simulation. Its all about the big trucks and driving around. Its more of an arcade than a sim game. I mean, plow your field, fertilize it, plant your seeds, wait some time (which is controllable by settings) then harvest your crops and deliver to the highest bidders. That's pretty much it. If you want stuff that makes it easier to do these various steps, buy bigger equipment. Can you trade to other players? Nope. Multiplayer seems more like a ""helping hand"" type setup where your friends can come into your game and help you farm. You give them some money to play with and they buy equipment and farm stuff for you. When they leave, everything they got or money they made (or is left over after they joined) is yours and comes back to you. There's really no point in giving them any money unless you're lazy and you don't want to buy stuff for people helping you all day long and you want to get work done on your own. Nevermind the fact that the mission system for the NPC players is disabled in multiplayer. What's up with that?? Why can't you and your friends do those missions too? Seems entirely illogical to have those missions disabled. It gives you more things to do!

Yes it looks good, and its an easy farming game. No worries about being stuck in the mud if you stick to the roads and your fields, but to me, if you're going to call yourself a simulator, how about you simulate all aspects of farming? Wheather, soil nutrients, chemical systems, different types of fertilizers, the simple ability to even clean your farm equipment after its all dirty... All of these things are part of farming that are entirely missed. Granted I haven't had much game time and maybe I just haven't seen these things. Feel free to correct me in comments, but to me these things should be more outlined in a refined simulator type game.

For them to call this a simulation of what its like to be a farmer, you get a thumbs down. This isn't a simulator for farming. Its more of an advertisment for farm equipment companies than a farming simulator. Its too late for a refund now. So hopefully if others are looking at this game they'll take heed that if they're looking for realism, look elsewhere. You won't find it here. Not even close. There is so much depth to farming its unreal. I work for an agricultural chemical company IRL.

Amazing graphics and attention to detail. I know farmers who have looked at this and couldnt believe the detail on equipment.
Is a great game to play and explore the life of a farmer without actually having to get you hand dirty or wait an actual 6-8 months for your crops to grow (but that is a option in the game menu).

After a couple... a few... a lot of drinks, for some reason this game is amazing! I have at least 3 friends that I know when they are too drunk to walk but want to play a game, Farm Sim is where we go. I dont know why, but its just FUN.

The game can be a bit boring at times and once you get things down pat, your basically working just to keep the farm going. Nwe equipment is fun to begin with but just like that new phone you got the other day, the excitement wears off. 
Grab it on sale and have some fun as they really put some great work into it. But dont expect to have 100 hours flash by and wonder where the time went.
But i still recommend this as it is some fine work. Maybe just not my thing, even though its still installed - just in case I have one too many and want a game to play.",1514200702,1514200702,True,15,9,0.630727648735046387,0,True,False,False

though it has some issues.
for one i have been playing it for waay to long now. 
and second it has some little niggly things i can't realy put my head around for not being adressed.
like, and this is not game breaking at all mind, you have the same farmer buddies in Sosnovka (a place heavy in eastern yurpian ambiance and those funny letters) why not a pavel or olga instead of mandy king and what have you.
the second little irritation is the way you work with the log loaders and i love the logging aspect as it gives me great pleasure to murder every tree in the game.
with my vast knowledge of driving diggers (i got to sit in one at a county fair once) i managed to set up my xbone controller so that i have the experienzo authentico what controls are concerned and all that but the way the physics is set up grabbing a log and preferably two or more logs is somewhat hard. the grabby bit goes absolutely nuts and you can never get a good grab at the first couple of logs.
they fall out, spazz out and end up everywhere. 
it's not frustrating but it makes it so killing every tree on the map and grinding them into a bridge over the river is somewhat slow and tedious. especially when harvesting on a planted tree lot type of arrangement. logs on piles and your arm getting spazzy is not nice.
other than that its great, i get greedy trying to see how much i can cram into the silos before selling and once you downloaded the mod ""courseplay"" from the awesome list of really quality mods that are out there you can basicly just hire slaves to do your work for you. granted you have to do some work showing m how to actually do it but after that bob's your cousin once removed.

447020,37989338,76561198160972523,0,15,7041,0,4955,1612284891,"Farming Simulator 17 is the most unbelievably tedious gameplay experience I've ever had, where most things should be automated by a worker so you can focus on farm ownership and growth, and not farm micromanagement. This game needs to be stripped down, automated, and made way easier to play, where processes are explained and spelled out to improve the overall gameplay payoff.  I'm surprised there are DLC's to this game, when the problem is the base game, and not the equipment, because the equipment I was looking for is not available in the base game, DLC's, or in any of the mods, because swathing and rock picking is not a part of the simulation, and those two things takes up a large portion of all farm life.

In order for me to recommend this game, here is a list of things that would need to change:

⦁Land in North America is subdivided by the quarter section and is on a grid, and this game will never feel like a true farming simulation and I will never recommend it, until there is a farm out on a homestead surrounded by quarter sections of land and grid roads, and you get to put things where you want them when you buy them and don't have to go get them.  Do a random google search of anywhere in the bread basket.

⦁Fields need to be rotated with different crops due to nutrient depletion and different fields have different soils that produce certain crops better than others, and crops only grow once a year, and that should be the focus of the entire game, land management per year along with organizing staff.   This game kind of encourages destroying the land for the sake of money, instead of taking care of it, even with fertizilier and planting oilseed, and it also treats workers as though they come and go by your command instead of encouraging a team effort and the importance of maintaining a skilled labor force, which is the entire struggle with farming, getting the most value for your dollar in terms of lowest input costs in the productivity of your equipment and workers to the highest returns in the price of the grain and animals.  So, creating some sort of labor section to the game where different workers have different levels of abilities and come at different costs would really add to everything, for example, the more you get a worker to do a certain task, the better they get at it.  I'd want workers for absolutely everything that is done in this game (transport, livestock, grain, and mowing), a fully automated simulation that you could just watch play out and check your financials and adjust as you go.

⦁All crops are measured, bought, and sold by the bushel, and should be in this game. All grain is graded by quality as well, for example number 1 wheat, number 2 wheat, and feed wheat, as well as dockage from contamination, which is in relation to weather and how well you farm/enjoy gambling.  Weather is a massive part of farming, and it's all that farmers talk about next to complaining about the government.  So, the connection between a wet early spring and good yield should play into the game, along with a long or short, hot, cold or wet growing season, and temperature during harvest would really add to the gameplay, but only if everything was automated.

⦁I like the competing markets, I just don't like that I have to drive to them, that should be automated by a worker or grain should just simply sell like you sell animals, with a touch of a button.  Also, do you have any idea how much more complicated it is to transport and sell livestock than grain? There are livestock auctions and breeding problems that are totally ignored in this game.

⦁No one ever went to the retail section of an outlet mall to buy farm machinery, lol!  Farm machinery is ordered from an industrial warehouse in your local town or city and delivered to your farm; you don't even need to go pick it up in real life, so why do you have to in this game?  You only go to pick up parts that break down.  It's simulating something that doesn't even exist, and it's super tedious having to go back and forth to pick up everything over and over again, it's such a huge amount of wasted gameplay time, when again, it should be automated by a worker or simply placed on your farm.

⦁Why can't you buy feed for your animals and have a worker take care of them?

⦁Why are there no auction sales?
 
⦁Why are there no quonsets, no grain bins, no augers, no swathers, no grain trucks, no harrow packers, and no rock pickers?  That is the basis of all farming, and it's not even in this game hilariously enough! Or John Deere?  You can't even call it farming without John Deere.  No Versatile Tractors either? No gas and diesel tanks you can put on your farm? You can't dig a well with a pump for your animals? No hemp, camelina, peas, lentils, clover for the bee hives to make real honey, flax, mustard, canary seed, rye, or oats?

⦁Why can't you set up the parameters of the entire simulation and then watch it run very quickly to see how your simulation will play out and then stop it at parts to adjust things and then speed it up again?  I'd prefer a Sim City style simulation more, than all the running back and forth.  Cultivating, seeding, and combining is all too tedious and slow and must be sped up but there's no way to do so at all, it's all at one slow speed.  120x only speeds up the growing season and not the automated gameplay, which doesn't make any sense, simulation wise, a true simulation works very closely with time of day in order to maximize output, instead of harvesting half a field with 3 days going by in the process. As an example, when harvesting canola there's a very tight window during the day when you can harvest, as you have to check the moisture content to make sure its less than 8% before you go out to harvest in the morning and before you finish in the evening, because if it exceeds that, it will heat and spoil in the bin and will get rejected at the elevator, unless you have a dryer at your farm.

⦁The breakdown of your financials is clunky and poorly organized, which is one of the most realistic parts of this game, because that's kinda how farmers are.

⦁The zoom over a tractor with an attachment, like a tractor and cultivator, doesn't zoom over the middle of the new object, but remains zoomed over the middle of the tractor, and doesn't allow you to see behind the cultivator when zoomed in close. Adjust the center point of a unit with an attachment to the center of the newly combined unit instead of remaining centered on the vehicle.

I found this to be a frustrating gameplay experience because you have to do the jobs that are the gopher's responsibility which are tedious and annoying when you could be focusing on your plan of growth for the future.  I'd rather play a farming simulator that had a different focus and style of gameplay altogether, like Sim City, that organized the farm by the year and broke down what had to be done by the season and could speed through seasons like winter where less is happening.  Unless they created a homestead far from town surrounded by quarter sections of land, added an automated worker to go get new equipment, sell grain, and move stuff around, and made everything less tedious and less hands on, and sped up the gameplay, and allowed you to set the parameters for the simulation, showed the depletion of soil quality on your land, showed the increase in staff ability and development, had more crop varieties, and added swathers, augers, grain bins, grain trucks and rock pickers, then this would be fun for me and a more realistic simulation.  As it is, it just simulates something that doesn't happen in the real world, and I mentioned nothing about the dangers of raising animals in such confined spaces and no option for the type of cattle to be raised.

Please note, I played 80+ hours to give this game an honest shot and it's super addicting but overall, more frustrating than enjoyable gameplay, for me.",1512172913,1512775907,False,8,1,0.443562924861907959,10,True,False,False

So I'm finnaly going to write a review on Farming Simulator 2017.

Dont get me wrong, this game is one of my favourites and I would recomend it to enyone and I had fun and will have fun playing fs17. 

The game is for sure an improvment from the last game but i dont think it justifies the almost 45%  higer price tag.
I mean it does run a lot smoother than the previous title did, it's got better gamepad support, better grapichs, in-game mod hub which is best improvment, they made a decent amount of improvments on the physics engine, added some more equipment. And added the FOV slider, custom setting.

The game is worth buying on a sale under 25$€ but not for the fixed price of 35$€
I think that the console prices of this game are too high, they pay [h1]30-40% more[/h1] than us on PC but you every game that is on all platforms is like this. Sony and Mircosoft are greedy maybe just a little too much greedy.

I give this game a 9.1/10 just because it dosen't have force feedback support which I think is a vital feature.
Enjoy the game and you need someone to playwith add me up and maybe we'll play.",1498546652,1512251822,True,52,2,0.782416045665740967,14,True,False,False

I held off on buying this as the one thing that really annoyed me about FS15 was the lack of head tracking support for it.  It ws the one thing that I felt that it really needed to make it perfect and now FS17 has it!  Yay!

Having bought FS17 it is everything I had hoped that it would be and more.  Not only is head tracking enabled but several things that were enabled as slightly clunky mods in FS15 are now in FS17 as standard.

For those who are completely new to the Farming Simulator series, the game is, as the name suggests, a simulation of many aspects of farming.  The game is first- or third-person view and allows you to farm using a wide variety of farm machinery such as tractors, combine harvesters, trucks, cars, and mowers.  You also have the ability to get out and walk around your farm on foot and there are a few, limited, activities that can be carried out without a big machine to help you.  

The game covers arable farming, animal farming, and forestry, and each of these go through growth and harvest cycles, each requiring different processes throughout.  Having cultivated, planted, fertilised, and harvested your crop you can then sell the harvest for cash with which to buy better equipment, more fields, pay off your bank loan, and buy seeds and other consumables to get your next crop going.  

This is not a game for those who are looking for a massive adrenaline dump.  It's a slow burn, enjoyable game, that will seem fairly dull to begin with until you realised that you just lost the weekend.  I have seen some reviews that describe this game as boring and I can understand that viewpoint, but it's either something you will enjoy or you won't.  It's not for everyone.  I find it extremely relaxing (except for stacking bales, that's really quite tricky and tense).

For those who have played FS15, things that I am really impressed with in this version are such things as head-tracking having native support (that's a total winner for me), having the option to have the vehicle auto-start on getting in it or having to press a button to start/stop the engine, and working wing mirrors on vehicle.  For me the combination of working mirrors and head-tracking are superb.  I have tried reversing trailers in real life and it is really hard.  In FS17 you will have lots and lots of opportunities to practise your trailer-reversing skills and in order to do that properly you need wing mirrors and the ability to look between them quickly and easily.  With these enabled it is very, very good.  I would recommend getting a head-tracker and steering wheel with pedals for the full experience.  It is possible to customise the controls so that the steering wheel and pedals only work when in-vehicle thus removing an annoyance from GTA5 where your character would gently drift left or right if the wheel wasn't completely centred when you were on foot.

In addition to the stock elements, the game has a huge number of mods available accessible in-game.  I have not played any of the stock farms yet, I have played from the outset on a farm called Coldborough Park Farm which is based on a real farm in Herefordshire.  As a Brit I absolutely love the fact that I can play the game in the same sort of countryside I can see driving to work.  There are very few games with hedges (yeah, I know, a small thing, right?) but they are a huge feature of the English landscape and it really makes the game seem realistic.  I have 17 hours in-game on FS17 and I have not had a chance to try everything yet: I haven't tried forestry or animal husbandry, and I haven't been able to do any of the missions (as I haven't found any fields that have them yet), but from what I have played the game is superb!

There are a few flaws.  The hired help is a drunkard who frequently drives my combine harvester into a ditch and then just leaves it there, or, at best, leaves great swathes of crops un-harvested, and he charges through the nose.  The fields are huge (I'm not sure if this is really a flaw) so working them can be a daunting task.  I liked some of the smaller fields in FS15 Hagenstedt as they allowed me to do quick turn-arounds, but this is more realistic.  It's one of the reasons I am willing to hire drunken-Bob to do the harvesting.  

If you liked FS15 I would say that it is definitely worth the upgrade to FS17.  The graphics are much, much better, the gameplay is better, and lots of features are enabled that made FS15 just not quite as good as it should have been.

If you fancy having a go at farming, give this a go.  I was initially put off the idea of playing a farming simulator as I could imagine my farmer friends scoffing at the idea until one of my farmer friends told me that he was pretty well addicted to it.  That was good enough for me.  Of course, it's one thing trying to wrestle the linkage of a three-ton trailer onto a tractor in freezing sleet in the middle of a muddy field in February, and another to sit at a PC in the warm, sipping coffee and doing it with the press of a button.

Also runs like a charm (FS15 lagged sometimes for me) on the highest settings. They have worked hard with new sounds and I appreciate it a lot, but tractors could do with more variety on sounds (many tractors share the same sound). I really like the new missions or contracting system, makes it a lot more interesting and you get to test out the high-end machines at the very beginning of the game. One thing I wish for, is Fendt 1050 as a base game tractor, which would be really awesome. This time, Giants have contributed with their own mods (+ tons of awesome mods by modders), which enhance the gameplay even further.
In conclusion, 9/10

Almost a year after first posting the review: Still awesome game, modders like BulletBill, Realismus Modding, OxygenDavid, Blacksheep modding etc. (just to name a few, there are a lot of great modders out there) have kept the game fresh for me and even made it a lot better and realistic.

It has the best graphics, the most equipment, and the most crops. That being said, I am going to review this game itself, and not compare it to its predecessors. 

There is a very large amount of content included in the base game. You get two maps*, one in America and one in Eastern Europe. You get equipment for growing, harvesting, and selling 8 types of crops*, wheat, barly, canola, corn, soy beans, potatos, sugar beats, and grass. You also get machines to take care of two types of animals, pigs and cows. Finally, you get a wide range of forestry equipment, to harvest, load, plant, and transport trees, as well as woodchipping. Although it will take a few hours of doing the boring work, you should soon have enough things to do that you will no longer be bored. 

That said, this game is never really exiting. It's fun, but in a relaxing, role-play sort of way. It can be very educational as well, but it's not hard core enough to turn anyone into a proffesional farmer. 

Also included in the game is a menue for downloading free addons (mods) made by the community. These include maps, equipment, features, and other things that contribute to gameplay very nicely. 

You can even play with up to 15 other people in the multiplayer mode. The servers are pretty slow, however, with long stops to syncronise every time someone joins a server. 

The physics for this game are very arcade-like, yet there are still problems often. Especially with logging, all kinds of strange things can happen. When the physics are not acting up, however, logging is a fun way to take a break from normal farming, and is made easier by you being able to pick up logs and strap them down on certain trailers, and the beds of the pickup trucks. 

Overall, I would give this game an 8 out of 10. It's not for everyone, but you should definitely try it.

When you first start out, you should absolutely do the tutorials. The issue with those though is that they only tell you so much. So the game has a bit of a learning curve. Which to me is a very good thing for a simulator. It's as simple or complicated as you want to make it. Want to get into the nitty-gritty of economics? You can totally do that and plan out absolutely everything. Just feel like painting some fields and driving some tractors around? Go for it. It's extremely satisfying to just drive your favorite tractor around for a while when you need a break from all the management stuff. Speaking of which, there's a lot of that in this game. And that is not a bad thing at all. It can get overwhelming at times, but it's all worth it when you finally get to afford the tractor of your dreams!

That was the TL;DR version. Moving on to the in-depth look.

So, when you first start out on a map, you start at a farm with some stuff already. Sweet! The catch is that it's heavily used stuff and is going to cost more and more to maintain as time goes on. So you should replace the old stuff with new stuff ASAP. Particularly the combine. That thing is going to bleed you dry if you hold onto it for too long. And though the game lets you lease things.....don't go that route. It start's out nice and cheap, sure. But before long you'll be paying 10,000 a day for that 60,000 tractor. Not so great. Sadly there's no Vanilla way to repair heavily used items but in all honesty this game is mostly about progression so you probably won't want to hang onto that beat up Case tractor any longer than you have to anyway. 

Once you're established with good gear and have a few fields, you will run into the problem of time. Mainly, having too much of it. Sure you could bump up the timescale, but where's the fun in that? Besides; it does more harm than good. This is where you have a few options. Assuming you don't have any mods installed yet, which you shouldn't on your first playthrough, your options will be somewhat limited in terms of making the most efficient use of your time. But that's also part of the charm. In the game you have a few things to do between tending the fields:

*Logging: You can cut down trees to sell. You can sell them straight up, you can sell them without branches, in logs, in blocks, or even as wood chips. Personally, I feel like logging can be a real PITA without mods. They've fixed a lot of the issues with the physics engine regarding logging, but some issues still remain. It CAN be fun, and often is, but not always. It's also expensive for what you get in return. If you have absolutely nothing better to do or you just really like sawing logs (heh) then by all means go for it. There are mods out there that really help with this. Check out CZ Tools if you want to kill most of the headaches associated with most of the vanilla tools.

*Grasswork: This is some of the most fun I've had in this game. Basically you mow grass. This is actually really fun and also really important for other things I will go into in a bit. Why would you do it besides for enjoyment? It's extremely beneficial to do for your farm. Grass can be used for all sorts of things. You can give it to animals, tedd it into hay and give it to animals, compact either into bales for storage or to sell (though not for very much like this), use hay for TMR, and ferment grass into silage which can be given to cows as-is, or used in TMR. You can also turn silage into Digestate, which is basically ground up decaying plant matter and has a really gross name. What would digestate be used for? Well, think about it for a second. What do cows eat? Grass. What do cows turn grass into? Manure. What can you do with it besides pouring it into Biff's car? Fertilize your fields. So basically you're taking the cows out of the equation. But the best part? Not only do you get free fertilizer (sweet!), but the game will actually PAY YOU for doing it. The catch is that unlike pellets or fertilizer juice, it goes REALLY fast. But it's free, and you actually make more money doing it in the long run, so it's worth doing. However, using the clamp silos, while neat and free, is a major pain and just feels archaic. There is a mod out on modhub that makes this step a breeze by figuratively cutting them out of the picture and giving you placeable fermenting silos that are vertical and are pretty much no-fuss. You load them with a trailer and unload them with one. However, there is one MAJOR gripe with making digestate. This has to do with loading the biomass plant. You CANNOT directly unload your trailer into the pit where the silage is put in. There really isn't a reason for this. At all. This is really stupid and makes no sense. Instead I guess you're expected to fill up a bucket loader and drive it all the way to the plant and unload it 1000 liters at a time??? Who's idea was that?! Screw that, man. But it isn't all bad. There is a workaround; it just takes longer than directly unloading the trailer into the pit and to my knowledge only works with trailers that have a grain door. Basically, you take the conveyor that can ""load directly into other trailers"" (the one with the big fat base on it) and set it up so that the belt drops the stuff into the pit. Then you set your trailer to unload through the grain door, back it up to the conveyor belt feed tray, and unload away. You don't have to babysit it, so you can go do other stuff, but just remember to check on it periodically. I imagine you could have several of these going at once but it just seems cumbersome for something that you could do in real life without a second thought or the need for a setup like this. Also, one final note on grasswork; you can harvest grass directly into a trailer with a forage harvester. Very nice for late game use. 

*Animals: This sort of overlaps with grasswork a bit. Basically there are four types of animals in the game: Chickens (you always have these little spies laying eggs and are really easy for a quick buck), Sheep (very easy still; just some grass and water), Cows (bit of a pain if you are making TMR which will get you the most bang for your buck; else just feed them grass or silage, straw for bedding, and water), and Pigs (hardest of them all as they require a very mixed diet, straw, and water). Animals will produce stuff (chickens lay eggs, cows make milk, dung, and slurry [eww], etc) and will breed on their own if conditions are met (they have food, water, bedding, room for more animals, eating areas are clean, etc) and either can be sold or used on the farm (dung, slurry). Even if you don't want to do any other animal, do sheep as they are extremely easy to take care of and give wool over time that can be sold for VERY high prices. 

*Poplar: I have only just started on this section, but its pretty straightforward. Basically you plant poplars on a field, and turn them into chips once they're done growing with a forage harvester. Don't know how lucrative this is yet though so I will update this once I know more.

Next I'd like to talk about the tractors and such. The first thing I'll say is that the prices for them are insane. When you have some cashflow going, it's not so bad. But when you have nothing except tattered hats and beard dirt? It's a nightmare. Enter the mods! There are hundreds of mods out there that add tractors. I recommend the ones that add Ford tractors, Fendt, New Holland, John Deere, and Zetor. The Case/IH ones are pretty good too. I love the Zetor ones out there very much. New Holland is great too. Also a lot of the time the modded tractors have added features like Interior Control (IC). Everything else is pretty good too.

Finally, the DLCs. First and foremost, yikes at that pricing! Yeesh! Crazy! Yet also 150% worth every penny. The packs add great stuff to the game and the new map is incredible",1511581250,1511581250,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Tending to the animals, your crops needs atention and by all means just take a stroll in the woods with your trusty chainsaw by your side. and then you FLIP! and start going ham in the forest, sawing all the trees in your path! reliveing all the stress that's been building up over time! imagening it's all the people you diss.... wait.

1. Don't buy the Steam version of this game as the copy to run your dedicated server. It has issues trying to launch the dedicated server. Lots of them. Just buy the game directly from Giants and the problems are completely gone.  This isn't explicitally spelled out anywhere, and I made the mistake of buying the Steam version and had to get it refunded.  Clients who are running the steam version will have no issues connecting.  It's only an issue with launching a dedicated server.
2. You must have a separate copy of the game to run a dedicated server.  This seems like an odd design choice by the developers, but not a show stopper for me - merely annoying.

Other than that - great game.  Graphics are on par with the rest of the entries in the series. No technical issues to speak of. Game works great and delivers on all fronts.

All the tractors are awesome especially the ones you get with the pre-order. I also like the way the game notifys you about a workers status and the addition of the cruise control so that you don't have to constantly hold down a button especially if your going down a long road or taking care of a field yourself.

I'd tried some other sims but this one was the one that had the least bugs and most selection (especially with mods/workshop items to add on).

I ordered this game before the 1st of November which meant that I got the Challenger MT700E Field Viper and the Valtra T-Series Cow Edition for free! Just to start things off these two tractors are an amazing addition to the game that I am quite thankful to have. 

The two base maps themselves (Goldcrest Valley and Sosnovka) are great starting maps and are quick to memorize. Even if you do get bored of these maps, you have the Giants ModHub to use to find other good maps that may give you a bit more of a challenge.

Also thanks to the ModHub, there are also many other mods available for almost anything you can imagine and they're all so easy to install and use.

Multiplayer is also quite good as well considering I don't exactly have the BEST of computers to play on, but the game still manages to run quite smoothly.

I was really impressed with how well this game runs though, as I said before I don't have a great computer where I run most games around 20FPS but Giants have done a GREAT job at making the game run smoothly as I can easily hit 40FPS and usually play with medium graphics.

Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to pass time, mess around, have some fun with friends or set up their own entire farm- Either a crop farm, Sheep, Cow, Pig farm or even get into the forestry business.

Driving is still garbage, the side mirrors are useless zoomed-in wank, physics elements are shoddy, vanilla gameplay is unbearable, no borderless window mode, no proper wheel/pedal/shifter support, alt-tabbing out of the game activates controller axises, no force feedback, the original Pacman ghosts had better AI than the AI traffic in this game.

Less than half-arsed money sink mechanics (vehicle maintenance) as a disillusioned attempt to add depth, no new features worth mentioning, logging equipment is trash (grabbing logs), sound engine is still trash (e.g. super loud birds, water, animal barks) and volumes can't be properly customised (e.g. engine vs environment, ""environment"" is the volume for everything when you're ""outside of a vehicle""). As a minor missing feature, no Steam Workshop integration for mods.

Can't rebind keys or set a multitude of options without the game reloading, having to be in the main menu and not in a game. Multiplayer is still an absolute joke with the game pausing for everyone to synchronise data for several minutes. Now they're bringing out a Platinum ""expansion"" for EUR 18,- that owners of the game have to pay full price as reward for their support and loyalty, while new players get the base game + the expansion for the old base game's price in a bundle.

They've been iterating Farming Simulator for a decade, you'd expect they know how to make a good game by now. 

Nope.

They really just come every two years to grab a load of cash for a bland cookie made of manure, with a few overpriced DLC sprinkles. It's better than the bottom shelf ""Simulator"" trash games, but I really hope GIANTS drowns in the mud(*) pit they've created, once one or two competitors pave the road to greener pastures.

This game only lives because of modding. Hobbyist modders put countless hours into machinery, vehicles, maps, adding so much more real depth to gameplay, and sometimes seemingly going beyond what seems to be the limit. Strong modding support is the only thing this game series has going for it, and would've not financed successors without.

I was sceptical but bought the game on a rainy weekend for ""something different"". Now 300+ hours later I still love it.    

More properly, the game is a tractor and implement simulator. The tedium of droning up and down the fields have been replaced with lots of different tractors and implements to try out in the basic game and tons more in easy to install mods.    Giants got the balance right.  Enough variety to keep a person interested in all the different facets and operations on a farm and just enough work to make a good harvest very satisfying.  Several different crops requiring different types of machinery and a few animals  having varyious needs provide even more opportunities to try out new equipment and provide clear goals for your crop farming activities.  If these are not enough there is also logging equipment in the game that can provide some rewarding challenge.

Farm Simulator 17 also offers enough flexibility to satisfy many different types of gameplay.  You can be very serious and plan out your crops for maximum yeilds and most efficient operations or just ""play"" with different equipment and see how it all works out.  

The physics model is quite ""generous"" and playful.  You won't have to worry about getting stuck too often.    The game definitely does not punish you for being a bit sloppy with your driving.  The graphics are great and sunsets on some of the maps are simply beautiful.

A very well rounded and adaptable game that provides more entertainment than it should. You might even find yourself curious about how a combine really works under the hood or browsing a tractor dealerships website ""just to look""...

Pros...
1. It can run on a potato powered by another larger potato feeding on only the power of the sun and moon and magic because the graphics are really like not good.

2. You can drive stuff around if you cant afford a real farm.

3. You can spend an endless time doing what seems like absolutly nothing and when you stop life just has this new sparkle.

4. When your waiting for your server to synce you can grab some food or travel the world(depending on the length of synce).

5. Mods make the endless grind a little better.

6.The community is meh at best but that leaves YOU the room to improve it because it pretty much consists of 50 or less players.

7. You wont have to learn much if you played 2015 because it pretty much that with more DLC and a higher price which is very nice if your a vet player.

8. Did I allready say it really helps you get a sense of pacience because of the ""druging"" gameplay and the utter lack of exitement. Looking at a wall almost is FUN after an hour of this game.

9. If you buy this you will be ready for farming sim 18 becasue there will be nothing different except the price tag.

10. There are money mods that let you make millions in seconds so any ""real"" money earned from gameplay feels meaningless.

Cons...
I guess you could say that there are a few bugs but other than that this games is pure enjoyment, and I really suggest that you buy it for its full price just to support the great DEVs behind the game. There is relly nothing that will ever compare to this game and franchise in quality or price and I see no better way to was..t.t err, I mean spend your hard earned cash.

This isn't an issue for most, but because I live in the middle of cornfields I'm stuck have to use a hotspot ($$ limited data $$) for out internet needs, this is not ideal at all to always be connected to the internet. 

Haven't taken the time to play the game since my disappointment of not being able to play via LAN but my 6 y/o really seemed to enjoy playing it when I first bought it for him, until I told him that I couldnt play with him.

Farming Simulator is one of those games that offers an awesome representation that covers shows you what you can expect to find on a farm and give you a taste of the administrative side of things, but plays things a little on the casual side of simulation.

In short - Farming Simulator takes the strangely relaxing experience of ubran planning and business management games then throws some serious agricultural hardware into the mix.  It's like your very own zen garden where you use Tonkas instead of rakes.

I was let down by this game at release. But after playing Gold Rush: The Game, i realize how much giants puts into their games.

Very late to say this, but good job devs. This is truly the superior simulator out of them all.

Regardless, your next game better have some serious upgrades in terms of gameplay. More in depth farming business to compliment the rest of the simulator and FS goes through the roof. I'm still waiting for this game to be MMO like and have our farms working on a true global scale.

However there is much about this particular series of simulators that needs improvement. I have played every single release in the farming simulator series and there are some things that are always lacking. There is no dynamic ground effects from the tire tracks and many games already have that implemented so it shouldn't be too much to ask for a farming game to include it because afterall working in less than ideal conditions is a big part of farming. Also except for not being able to harvest while it's raining there are no weather effects in the base game and again that is a big part of farming. 

On another note the helper system....has always and most likely will always be complete garbage. If the field isn't perfectly square they are utterly useless and end up wasting you more time than they save. It simply cannot be that difficult to scan each field on a map and put that information into a helper code so they are able to actually do their jobs in the fields properly. 

The developers of this series need to seriously sit down and work on some of the main aspects of farming and make these games more of a simulator and less of an arcade style game. They seriously are going to have an extremely difficult time surpassing Cattle and Crops when it's released and they may not win fans back when it's time to release FS 2019 if they don't make some drastic improvements.

Also I would like to add a word about their DLC content.....In the past and with this particular version of the game the content is not at all worth what they charge for it. Yes the big bud content has some large equipment in it but is nowhere near the $15 they think it is. The other dlc isn't even worth $5 honestly. These dlc's should come free with the game as included equipment and not a simple money drain from the customers. There are hundreds of mods that include the same or better equipment and are available on the public sites.....for free!

The variety of machines that you can use with all their combinations of expansions and attachments etc in a variety of realistic tasks on the farm are really great fun to use and operate. 

One of my favourite things about this game is that it has plenty of variety - whether you want to farm crops, or just do missions for other farmers, or do logging (which can be done with very little equipment right up to some fantastically fun equipment) or look after animals - or do all three and just chop and change between them!

Some FANTASTIC mods on the mod hub as well - the Massey Ferguson tractor and accessory pack is a must-have imho, and it's free, incredibly.

I run a server for subscribers to my channel and it's popular among subs - great fun getting lots of people together to operate the farm, and makes longer jobs much quicker when you have four people ploughing a field together!

Hey trucks, all sorts of trucks. Well not all truckers get to go round Europe or vast swathes of the US, some prefer to work closer to home, but before you get any work you stuff to haul. OK the real point of this game is the endless cycle that is farming, Plant, nurture, reap, plant and all the other activities to help crops along to being a movable, sellable commodity.

I've owned every version since FS2011 (This is the first I got via Steam). Its truly great game from Giants Software and with many improvements over FS15. New features that improve the gameplay include the a option to lease machinery as well as buy, the ability to pick small objects by hand which is great picking up those fiddly small bits of trees when logging. There's also new crops in sunflowers and soybeans as well as a new animal type, pigs which seem to breed like rabbits. In one of the vanilla maps theres even drivable trains to transport large amount of crops and logs around.

   The missions are now more meaningful and related to farming. Instead of before where you just transported pallets around the map, you now do work on fields that are not owned by you. This has the added benefit of having crops growing in all fields rather than having them empty until you buy them which gives the map a more dynamic feel.

   The game with its two maps is great fun to play as it is out of the box but you would be missing out on one of the best aspects of this game; the mods. There is a continuously growing number of mods that are available, most of which are very simple to install. Theres the mods that add extra maps and machinery which improve the variety and choice in the game. Then there's the gameplay mods such as GPS mod, courseplay, and 'follow me' mod that help make tasks that little bit easier. Then there's ones like the seasons mod than make  the game more realistic. Best of all these mods don't cost a cent unlike a certain train game where you have to get the credit card out when you want more content.

It is quite fun working through the farming and tech trees, and feels challenging even on easy mode.  I've earned and spent probably half a million dollars and am still dead-flat broke.  I am working less than half the crops on the original paddocks...

If you buy in [url=http://farmingsimulator.wikia.com/wiki/Farming_Simulator_17]have the wiki[/url] and the community  forum open, because the learning curve is quite sharp and punishing, especially if you have no farming background.  What is a tedder for?  Do I need to windrow?  Is silage like planking or  the ice bucket challenge?  There are dozens upon dozens of expensive(!) equipment options for the dozen harvestable crops, and multiple brands of gears, which are (mostly) incompatible with each other.  Just bought a new $200K forage harvester?  Great, your old header combs don't work with this, you must buy more hardware.  Too bad if you spent all your money... (yes, you can get more through missions, or sell updated gear, or get a loan, or lease...)

I will say that patience is key in this game, and it's a lot of fun inching toward long-term goals, upgrading your gear and buying more to try out new cropping techniques.  Be prepared for a LOT of mind-numbing rumbling back and forth over the same paddocks again and again and again, and getting frustrated when your attention wanders and your coverage is less than perfect.  I took on one mission not realising it was est. 110min sowing 3ha @ 9m swath, succeed or you get nothing.  OMG.  I think I did it half the time, but still, 55mins [i]realtime[/i] without pause rolling up and down a paddock in the dark looking for dark brown on darker brown patches is not fun.  Time compression doesn't actually seem to speed the game up, just the time of day.  I did like the built-in internet radio channels which is a neat and logical feature (these can be customised and you can also load your own music files).

Against the boring parts, it runs beautifully even on old computers like mine (mostly 60FPS on ultra-highest settings), is very pretty and there's always things to do, even if it's just mowing the lawns, cleaning up your vehicles and stacking your bales neatly.  Cruise control, AI helpers, intuitive simple controls, multiplayer and peripheral support make farming a lot easier and fun.  Good difficulty settings and custom configurations extend the playability.

Modding appears to be very big, at least as big as it is Spintires or even bigger, but it doesn't have Steam Workshop.  It does have it's own in-game mod interface and it's easy to add 3rd=party mods (just drop zipfiles into MyDocs game folder)

Overall, if you're a persistent person that enjoys 'growing' your success and overcoming complicated longwinded challenges, you should enjoy this.  Or you could just blow all your money on grown-up Tonka trucks and tool around the countryside posing for screenshots, then restart. :)

Pro:
- Pretty good AI; does a fairly impressive job pathfinding even when you've modified the edges of your field
- Game flows at a good rate; things happen predictably, when you expect them to happen; very few surprises

Con:
- occasional AI boners; AI sometimes likes to turn around in the middle of a row and go back down the next row, or just ignore the end of the row
- the clamps of every tool used in forestry is coated with some kind of ""super Teflon"" and will literally launch logs out of the grip randomly.  Hilarious the first 40,000 times it happens, annoying AF after that
- the steering likes to behave oddly... you'll be turning left, and all of a sudden your steering wheel jams over there and you crash.
- I was adding 3-4 windmills every day, and my property income was going down every day.  How???  Is it supposed to be ""wear and tear"" on the turbines?  A little too much realism there, particularly since I couldn't figure out if I could repair them.

But definitely a decent game; one of those games that you can play while also watching tv, talking on the phone, IM'ing, *and* playing another game.

First off, I love the game as you can probably tell by my hours played. I enjoy games that allow me to build slowly over time, and I don't like easy quick gratification games. I spent prolly the first 100 hours just trying new maps, learning the game, basically just getting a plan together. Finally I settle on Westbridge Hills, I spent the next 300 hours building a business, no money mods, just hard work and time. I like that I can come home from work, spend an hour baleing hay, feeding animals or whatever, save the game and log out, no strings attached like a MMO, which is my normal sort of game. As all gamers know, it is very important to save regularly in this sort of game, one power flicker from a storm or whatever, and you just lost an hours work, or even more if you're not careful, so I save on a regular basis. So this is where the bad comes in. I get up on Saturday and start my normal deal, let's get this field mowed before I have to leave for the day,  I get it done, save the game, and leave. I come home later that day, log into the game and POOF!!,, all placables, as well as equipment is GONE!!,, just gone..  I still have my money, but everything, and I mean everything else is just gone. I don't want to give the game a bad review, I feel that I certainly got my monies worth if you figure the hours of play time that I enjoyed, but I still had big plans for that farm. I tried to just say the heck with it and start a new one, on a new map, but it went from a fun process, to just plain work.  I'm sure you smart computer guys know a way to have a back up save, so you could have gotten around this, but I just counted on the game save alone. I don't want to spend more time learning to hack game files, than I do enjoying a game. I'm gonna leave a thumbs up, since it really is a cool game, but with a warning.

[h1] Review [/h1]

If you like Simulation games, this is a great one to add to your collection. It's a great family and cooperative game that is both fairly relaxing and deceptively challenging. You can certainly play the game casually, but playing it as intended means a fair dedication of time. It will take a long time to do everything there is to do, and there is a lot of it. Farming ranges from the typical grains to the more involved root crops. You also have animal husbandry available and it goes well when done side-by-side with regular farming. The last major job available is Forestry, which is one of the most engaging tasks available in the game, although it can be frustrating due to in-game physics.

Each map starts you with a couple of fields, farming equipment, and a loan of varying amounts depending on the difficulty. From there on, you make your decisions as to how to play and what to do. You can sell all your equipment right from the start and do whatever you like. Fields you don't yet own are ""owned"" by NPCs who will offer you jobs to work that field and is a great way to make early money. Just don't spend too much time on other fields and not your own. Each job raises your reputation for that field and in turn lowers the price to purchase. Jobs are unfortunately but understandably not available in multiplayer. You can take a bigger loan to expand your business, make money from selling crops when the price is high, or even hunt hidden ""nuggets"" for a big cash bonus and an achievement. 

The amount of vehicles and tools available to help you in your chosen roles is astounding and here might be one of the drawbacks. It can take a while to fully understand what they all do and what the advantages of each are. You are likely to have a whole selection of these that you will just never use unless you purposely try them all. With more tools and attachments come more key bindings to remember. The F1 help menu is great at listing the main keyboard shorcuts, but many are only learned if you dig deep. The game is not difficult to play by any means, but it is difficult to master. Parents who play with their kids should definitely aim for about 6-7 yrs and up unless your child is very familiar with these type of games.

Graphics are great for what the game is looking to achieve. Most of the game engine power will be dedicated to tracking your crop and equipment status and you'll grow to have a lot. The equipment is incredibly detailed with great animations of moving parts all realistically working. Older computers can still play the game but will be forced to lower settings and limit the amount of equipment on the screen. Forestry may be very difficult with slower PCs as the tree rendering and physics will cause lag. Sound design is decent but some of the machines do not feel powerful. Sounds are also shared across some equipment which leaves little to tell them apart sound-wise. I imagine some of these tractors and harvesters have very unique engine notes that sadly do not stand out. There is a built-in game radio that your can tune to online music streams and comes with some basic ""radio stations"" with a few songs each. You'll likely listen to your favorite music separately and never use the in-game offerings.

If you like downloading add-ons or ""mods"" for games, you will find a wealthy offering by the community. The game features a built-in mod browsers which is a huge step up over previous versions. The mods available here pale in comparison to those available at many online sites, however. Do be warned that some of these sites may have ads or even malware, so be careful when browsing. The community mods can vastly add and transform the game, making it more realistic, larger, adding more vehicles, crops and even jobs like mining. Giants also has DLC avaliable, but nothing that you really need. Kuhn DLC has extra tools but nothing spectacular except the square bale wrapper. The Big Bud DLC requires a large map and you won't have the need for big tractors unless you're later in the game and made some money for bigger fields.

All in all there is a lot to do here. If a job gets too boring there are other ways to do it or other jobs to do to keep it different. There's multiple approaches to almost all jobs and money making is fairly balanced if you're playing it as designed, so just do what you like. You'll obviously have to like the sim genre, but the game offer the best farming simulation out there. With several major releases under their belt, this latest release really does have a complete package. Not entirely without faults, but it is by far the best of its type out there, and a fantastic investment in terms of play value; especially with friends. Highly Recommended. 

If you are unsure about whether you would like the game, or cannot afford it, you will find a lot of what FS17 has to offer in the older FS15, but the newer version is definitely superior. See these notes below for some of the differences

[h1] Notes for owners of Farm Sim 2013/2015 [/h1]

If you own the older FS13, you will find a huge step up in content. There are changes to some mechanics so watch a couple of videos online if you're not too sure. Definitely worth the upgrade.

FS15 players I know are going to be on the fence. I actually decided to write this review almost just to point out some of the reasons to upgrade. Obviously this will be personal opinion but I feel those saying FS17 offers nothing new from 15 are wrong. Here is is a quick list of the new things:

[list]
[*]Soybeans and sunflowers now stock crops
[*]Pig farming
[*]New vehicle types like weeders (Work like fertilizer)
[*]Performance improvements (FS17 runs better and looks better on my PC over FS15)
[*]In-game Mod hub
[*]You can pickup and move objects (Great for Forest work in a budget)
[*]You can strap objects down! (No more logs floping all over during transport)
[*]Vehicle customization (Change engines wheels and other options in the shop, you can upgrade vehicles after purchase)
[*]Vehicle lease/rent now stock
[*]3 Fertilizing stages + plowing actually does something (+10 % yield from plowing)
[/list]

Catch it on a sale if you want, but it is worth the update to FS17. FS15 mods are almost all available in 17, and the new Platinum version coming out in November actually looks pretty good. Adds sugarcane farming!",1506332118,1506332692,True,62,3,0.843060910701751709,2,True,False,False

Farm sim 17 is an upgrade from the previous Farm sim 15. It has brought with it all the great features of 15 and added more content (a lot more machinery to buy which is great!)  slightly better graphics ( new particle/dust effects, textures look slightly better) and of course 2 new maps to play on in the stock game. 
First off It took a bit to get back into farm sim but once i had harvested my first field I was ready to rock n roll and take a look at what new things the game had to offer...and then came (in my opinion) the biggest blunder of Farm sim 17....missions!! unlike 13 and 15 to make some extra money...you dont have a phone for mission (13) or various mission posts on the map (15) instead you have the ability to help other farmers by going to the sign where you would usually buy the field, and you get offered a job to harvest their field (or sow, plough or wotever) and you get paid once its done....

heres the thing though

....some of these missions pay very well (the more you do for that person the cheaper the field becomes if you want to buy it) AND the person your working for lends you their own machines for the job... So i cant help wondering that If your doing lots of these missions and making good money easily AND not needing to use your own tractors...well (for me anyway)...it hardly seems worth bothering to harvest your own fields...which take longer as you have to plough, cultivate, sew, blahblah...pay any helpers etc.... and take forever to make around the same money you get for missions.....and this takes the fun out of trying to build up a farm for me....Im sure others will like the new mission system but i certainly dont.

I would still recommend the game....although id say for those who own sim 2015...wait till this comes out on sale...as it aint a vast improvement over 15 and as ive mentioned above...it has its downsides...at least for me anyways. Newcomers if you dont mind the mission side of it...by all means give this one a go...its still a great simulator",1505957615,1505957789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well let me tell you who and why. Me and because it's some of the best zen gaming I've ever played. There's no shooting or getting shot at, no rushing against a time limit, no impending doom or limited ammo. Farming Simulator is chilled out gaming, sure you can have huge farm with tons of stuff going on and rush around managing it or you can just cut some trees down with your trusty chainsaw (of which there are a few to choose from) load the logs into your pickup and sell them at the yard.

There's loads (and I mean loads!!) of farm machinery to buy and even more available for free via a very simple to use modding community. I now know my tedders from my wind-rowers.

Here's a tip though to get money quickly so you can buy whatever you like:
1/ turn on speed to 120x
2/ sell everything you have got.  borrow some money so total is 120,000.  Buy a solar collector
3/ The first solar collector will bring in good money.  Then pay back a bit of loan and buy another solar collector
4/ Do this until you have about 15 collectors.  Then buy a wind turbine
5/ Finish up with about 5 wind turbines.
The above will take about a day or maximum 2 days.  Run it at night.

If you have a real nice computer to run this on, it's almost a work of art- There's detail where you'd least expect it. The gameplay is also wonderful, you have a couple different ""routes"" you can go when it comes to making money; making the biggest farm you can, handling huge heards of animals, or furiously logging. The game also has a pretty sophisticated economy, which takes a lot of variables into consideration, and also makes you think about how you can maximize your return on investment.

Compared to previous versions of Farming Simulator, it certainly is an improvement in several categories, including visuals, physics, and general game mechanics. Many people do say that it's not much of an improvement compared to Farming Simulator 15, and I partially agree with them. I feel the part that makes it worth the upgrade would be the assortment of new and improved assets- some things in FS15 just felt poorly put together, meanwhile FS17 offers a wide variety of equipment (with lots of extra options too), all of which brings a new or improved experience to the table.

If you own a previous version of FS, I'd suggest watching YouTube videos of FS17 or potentially seeing if a friend can let you play, because my opinion of it being notably better than FS15 may not be the same as your opinion as to how similar it really is, and you can decide for yourself if it really lives up to the hype.
If you've never owned/played Farming Simulator before, and you're interested in it, I highly suggest this game for you, (partly because there's no major advantage to purchasing an older version), as it'll be able to provide you with hours of fun (or screwing around), and there probably won't be another version until around 2019.

For the most part I do forestry. I work in the forestry business for a living and find this addition to the game the most fun part for me. Its not perfect, but it got the basic feel to it. With the propper mods it becomes even better.

I think what really gets to me is the variety of different tools you can use. All from basic tractors and tools to forestry harvesters and on to transportation veichles. Many people who does things like this for a living, like me, find it interesting to try on other stuff then one normally would do.

I recommend that to really get something of the propper feeling out of this game you should at least get a steering wheel and pedals. If you do forestry, get dual joysticks.

Even after 20 hours of play I can't get used to whatever the hell is going on with the steering system. I can't even drive along a straight road without losing control, yet on another game can land a helicopter with pixel precision, so it can't be me, yet this game somehow has 88% positive I have no idea how. Constant over steering, constantly crashing into things. Tractor steering is terrible, car driving is completely unplayable. I wonder if all the developers play with steering wheels and didn't even bother to play like the average player that steers with WASD because I can't think of any other explanation as to why you'd release a game where you spend 95% of your time driving and not even make a decent driving system. I don't even remember it being this bad on the last FS I played which was 2013.

A game with extremely complex controls yet you can't edit or even view the control list without having to disconnect from your game. This is probably the only game I've ever played that won't let you edit controls while playing, even 20 year old games let you do this... When you save your settings or disconnect from a game, the game restarts itself, this may only takes a few seconds but it's some seriously dodgy coding, no other game I've played does that.

When driving you can switch between first person and third person yet on foot you can only be first person which doesn't make sense because it's not like this is a first person shooter and what's with being forced to have a crosshair when you don't have any weapons to aim...

They haven't even fixed the random super lag in multiplayer that was in 2013. Super lag is about once every hour for 30 seconds, if driving, your vehicle will warp every second and the speedometer goes crazy, once it lagged so bad the speedometer jumped to 300 kph. Farming simulator is the only game that has this weird kind of super lag.

When entering a vehicle it takes 3 seconds for it to actually start moving, why have a realistic feature like that which wastes time but have such an unrealistic feature that saves time where you can instantly teleport between vehicles with a key press?

When playing multiplayer it doesn't even sync field state without going near it, so in the distance you might see a field ready to harvest and it shows on the map too as ready to harvest then you go near it and pieces start showing as harvested on screen and on the map.",1498855928,1502993170,False,7,1,0.483630925416946411,0,True,False,False

I do think it is better, all be it, lots of small tweeks rather than drastic changes. 
I now play with wheel/pedals coupled with a  game pad and a mouse and I think it transforms the in game experience having these.

I think there is still room for improvement in the economy, the ai workers and some aspects of the phyics. I would like to see more in the way of a farm management aspect which on a big farm is more realistic than the owner having to do everything and drive everything to the fields. For example it would be good if you had to employ workers full time, pay them a salary and delegate jobs to them. There could be an office in the yard and a smart phone where you could tell them which tractor to take, which field to go to and what to do, etc.
It would also be good if you could buy in stuff in bulk and have it delivered to the farm. things like seed, silage, straw, hay, muck, etc.

My main bug bears with 13 and 15 (which on the whole, have been dealt with) were:

The fact that you couldn't tip your trailer anywhere apart from the designated areas.

The physics for the bales and logs were a joke. You would lift the loader boom up and the bale/log would fly off 10,000 feet in the air.
If you could actually manage to get a load onto a trailer, they would soon unload themselves the second you set off. Whilst 17 is an improvement, its still not 100% sorted but its workable with the right equipment.

The livestock always felt like a pointless tagged on aspect of the game but in 17 they are very much part of the game.

The graphics and physics were lacking and have been improved to a much more acceptable standard.

To sum it up. If you bought  FS15, you had to mod the hell out of it to fix or get arround all the anoying things that really should have been dealt with by the game makers as they were all present in Fs13. Fs17 includes a lot of these mods as standard and as a result you spend more time enjoying the game rather than constantly trying to find mods to fix something that really pisses you off.

Preface this by the fact that I know exactly nothing about farming, and I had no interest, but I think the equipment is cool.

I am ADDICTED TO THIS GAME. I had no idea that farming could be so cool, not to mention the ability to do so many different jobs all at the same time. I love it, and 40 hours in a few short days shows, I have a serious problem.

Only a few things about this game need improvement (nothing game breaking or warranting any less of a great score.)

1. I wish the workers you hire could be just a bit more competent, they have trouble navigating any field that isn't perfectly square on all sides, which makes things very frustrating when you have 31 fields to tend to.

2. Something needs to be said about the fact that we cannot remove the small trees  and bushes that are all over in many maps. you would imagine a mower as gigantic as we have access to, would be able to eat these shrubs and foilage. 

3. Hopefully in the next version we have the ability to plant things like orchards and vineyards, maybe in essence a better end game goal. Also, little features like a GPS line to help keep your machine on track in a straight line according to the field you are tending to.

Either way, this game is a massive time killer and a great distraction while I wait for Star Citizen 3.0 to launch.

9/10 would farm again. (I absolutley will)",1502074628,1502074628,True,1,0,0.506451606750488281,0,True,False,False

I got back on an logged back into the game to continue where I left off to find that all of my tractors and buildings I purchased were not there. The starter equipment for the map was gone also. I saw in my files the last save right before dinner and cant pull up that file. I tried three other maps and I am still having the same issue on those maps. My money balance in game reflects where I bought the items but my equpment is not there. Has anyone had this problem and if so how can I fix it. This just started happening today.

While working the fields the farm implements only affect the specific space that is defined as the field so there is no realism of missing plots or overshooting. The traffic is not interactable and neither are the people. Overall this is not a simulator but a game with a farm theme. 

I cannot stress enough the very bad physics of the game and lack of simulation, perhaps in the gaming world simualtion has a different definition.


For a game labeled as a simulation the tag should be removed.

You can use belts to automate movement of materials
If you want to pull a plow with a MAN Truck, you can do that 
make huge open fields by choping down all the trees using a chainsaw or automated machinery and dump them in the mill pond
turn all your fields into grass and make money from selling the cuttings
raise animals for meat keeping the bare minimum of crops to feed them
make millions from windfarms
try to see how far a truck can jump or how far you can go offroading
spend an hour trying to get a full water trailer from a river with the cheapest vehicle
spend hours trying to work out the best way to make the biggest profit with the cheapest equipment

More importantly you can correct people on the difference between a hay bale and a straw bale even though you thought you didn't care.

If you want to start out with nothing and work your way up, you can, or if you'd rather start out with some really cool equipment you can.
I get to play my way.  Personally, I start a new map and sell everything and start over with trashy equipment that I've doloaded form MOD Hoster or Giants, or FS-UK.  All good sites.
It's a breeze to add a new map or mod to Farming Simulator, or you can download the map creator/editor from Giants' website and build your own world to farm in.
This addition added drivable trains.  very cool. It also added the ability to dump your trucks anywhere and pick it back up in a front end loader.

Course Play is another great add-on for the game that lets you do more then hiring helpers, which btw, works a lot better then the last builds.

A large amount of people suggest that Fs17 is a waste of money due to it's similarity with Fs15, but i believe people do not explore the differences between both games. Fs17 contains a large amount of graphical and physics based improvements, this allows the game to be more realistic than ever which is what people 'should' want in a simulator game. Now it is also understandable that gameplay features are also important but the majority of players of Fs15 believe in quantity over quality when it comes to game based additions. They prefer 'shallow', un-stereotypical  forms of making money such poplars, bales and extra animal management.

Like i said, Fs17 is a great game and i strongly recommend that (if you're into simulators) you should purchase this game.

To new players:
Farming Simulator 2017 is a good looking game where you will experience everything you would by running a farm.
That being said it is a grind game and a game where you relax more then activly play.
Should you get it?
Well if you want a game to relax with and play while watching movies or youtube. Then Yes.
If you want an active game, then no.

To FS11/13/15 players:
The game is an upgrade to all the previous games, however the leap from Fs15 to Fs17 is not the largest, I found that it was worth it, but you may not. Graphically speaking its the same. Gameplay wise its the same old in a new box. It's a good game and better than Fs15, so if you have the spare money laying around, I would strongly suggest this game!",1499638196,1499638196,True,3,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

Pro's:
+ The greatest draw to this game is the open world and freedom to do whatever you want.  You can either play the campaign for realism or free play to just drive around in cool vehicles right away, or personally, I enjoy spending time logging mixed with farming, which has been expanded and improved in this game.
+ Tons more vehicles than the previous game, in virtually every aspect
+ A slightly better AI system than previous
+ Mod support including easy access to mods from a built in mod menu, including tons of free mods added from Giants software themselves.

Con's:
- The AI is still a bit wonky, I had cleared out all trees near the edges of my farm and expanded the borders of fields with plows, but then the AI would do weird things like not harvest or plant in certain areas or would get themselves stuck on rocks, etc.  
- No AI still for things like straw collectors/balers or tipper drivers.  The AI is still ""stupid"" and is unaware of other AI vehicles, meaning two AI vehicles meeting on the same path will get confused and get stuck requiring manual intervention.  This happens a lot say with cultivators and seeders, if they meet at the edges of the field when they try to turn, even if they're not overlapping each other.  AI vehicles also get confused if something is in their path, even if it would be easy to just go around or avoid it (like a trailer parked on the outside edge of a field that seems out of the way enough).  
- Money seems harder to make in this game than previous, and harvest missions almost seem like the fastest way to get money early on, and not develop your farm.  If all you want to do is just work on and develop your farm, they should have made it easier to start out imo.  This is especially problematic because you start out with old tractors that have really high repair costs and will drain your income.  

All in all I was hoping this game would expand on the AI aspect to really allow you to play more of a farm management role instead of a farmhand itself, and while the AI is slightly less stupid than previous and other comments have pointed it out, it still has a long way to go and still requires you to do quite a bit of the work.  It should be called more accurately as a ""Farm Vehicle Simulator"" than ""Farming Simulator,"" and had I known the AI was still fairly bad I wouldn't have picked up this title, and by the time I really figured it out I was past my 2 hour refund mark.  

All in all, I still gave it a recommendation.  What I wanted out of this game may be different than others, and I'm still enjoying it despite the limitations.  It's a game I'll sink 80+ hours into I'm sure before I move on to something else, but at the same time wish it was something more than what it is.",1499313494,1499313494,True,4,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

Yes, the developer ""optimized"" several things, the graphics look better, overall performance is better, Multiplayer is more forgiving. But where there is light there is also darkness. The performance increase (especially in Multiplayer) came at some cost with sync between players. Players don't see the same stuff anymore. For example the AI Traffic. One player sees several vehicles in front of him, while somebody else sees absolutely nothing. Emptying the manure heap at the cow stables updates several minutes (!!!) later in the Menu. This is ridiculous. 

Modding became a pain in the neck. While Giants published the Sourcecode in previous versions, this time they decided to only write a incomplete function description. There was no information at all from Giants about some important changes in the game (like the new storage system). It just was so painful to create new maps. The forums from Giants are there, but no involvement from Giants. Not one answer on how things changed or worked now.

And let's be honest, Giants made some improvements to the underlying engine, but you do notice that it just opened a can of worms at other ends. The engine is so pretty much at its end of life.

It appears though that Giants focused this time much more on the consoles, for PC Players the game is more of a slap in the face. I don't care if the PS4 doesn't support modding the same way a PC does. I don't care about the politics behind Sony's decision. But you get a crippled product because of this. I am a PC Player, so don't take away the ability to mod the living hell out of this game just because the mods wouldn't work on a PS. 

The modding community is slowly on a decline. If you take a look at the main modding site (No, not Modhub from Giants itself, the other one) you will find the 500th version of the standard map ""Goldcrest Valley"", a tree moved to the side and a ""new"" map on modhoster. There are tons of converted mods from LS15 which more or less are full of bugs, lots of re-skins etc. All in all just crap. Real innovative mods are missing this time. Shame, but it is a sign of the changed modding support of this game. 

But...it is still fun to play FS17, as long as you figured out how to work around several of the issues.

If Giants does carry on the path with the next version of FS i have to say that the FS17 will be the last version i bought. 

BTW the upcoming CnC is, from what i saw so far, several years behind the FS in the development stage. So don't hold your breath. 

I am not sure how i should rate the game, there are several good aspects (also compared to previous versions) but i can't agree with the path Giants chose this time. I therefore decide to not recommend the game anymore. Hopefully it will change with the next version again.",1499260120,1499260120,False,120,8,0.702421784400939941,14,True,False,False

But main reason i feelt i needed to make a review is purely: ""Dedicated Server""

What type of greedy company would force you to buy a second account for setting up a poorly configurated server, to play on with a few friends?

As that wasent bad enough It requires a key that you wont get from the steam version.

A real stand alone Dedicated Server tool is very much required here to make this game worth close to its original price.

In general it feels like you have to do a lot of driving and I don't really enjoy that. I prefer managing stuff.
The good part is, the game feels more realistic than fs 15 and they've implemented some of the mods from fs15 into it. The mod manager makes it really easy to have control over the mods. 
It also feels like the game wants to become a multi player game, haven't tried it like this yet.

Has a 1hr slot on my youtube channel once a week as some of my followers like it.  Very repetative but the new missions in the game do make it fun to do.  No challange and only two maps from the makers.  DLCs are exspensive and not worth the money.

I can definitely vouch that its good but its my first Farming Simulator game besides a miniscule amount of time on Farming Sim 15. I've never considered myself to actually be playing a Farming Simulator game because of all the hardcore FPS, open world games and strategy games that are out there. Its an amazing game, relaxing and a welcome refresher. From operating huge machinery tending your fields and selling your crops for profit, creating a lumber operation (Every tree on the map is able to processed and sold) or taking care of sheep, pigs and cows you have the option of playing as the farmer you want to be. If you even want to farm at all! Its up to you. The open world and first person character give the game new life and a welcome perspective for even more realism. Ive only had a few gripes with the game. It runs great at 4k resolution at max settings (Running a GTX1070 16gb ram and intel i7 3.8ghz) but ocasionally the tractors start to stutter and the frame rate dips, apparently a bug from the last update with the game that has not been fixed. I dont encounter the problem often, but its a quick fix with a save, quit and reload. The game only takes a few seconds to load which is great. Also Im having a problem accessing a save with 40+ hours which is frustrating. Other then that the game runs great from what ive experienced with almost 50 hours. With an extremely large modding community with built in support to being able to play with 16 other people in multiplayer you wont run out of stuff to do. Never thought I would but I highly recommend Farming Sim 17.",1497743822,1497744043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros;
Played in 3 Days= 29 hours
Over 250 Vehicles
Mods
Great gameplay
Full controller support
Co-op is amazing
Forestry equipment
Animals
Always something to do
Can switch currency(from £ to € etc.)
Relaxing and chill game
Not too hard nor easy
Don't have to do the same thing if you don't want to
Many more..

Cons;
Peer to peer 
Price(35€ atm.)
Can be too grindy sometimes( does not affect me, so its + or -)
Expensive dlc's
It takes all of my time, send help
That's all. 

Overall, it's an incredible game! I would recommend to buy it with friends, since it can be boring when played alone. Amazing work done by the game developement team. Cudos to you. For those people with strict NAT(like myself), dedicated servers are priced from 3€ to 6€ with 4 player slots.

I personally think this game is quite entertaining because I find mowing lawns (with a riding tractor) fun and enjoyable and sometimes feel like I haven't done enough. But this game is far more than mowing a lawn. Let's put down a list of great activities you can do in this game, some of which you can do in previous games too ie FS 15 and FS 13.

1. Running a crop farm. Basically means you take out your planting machines (sowing machines, not to be confused with sewing) and cover a field in crops of variation, wait, then take out the according harvesting combine to pick it up and sell the collected crop.

2. Mowing lawns. Yes if you really wanted, you can waste time mowing lawns, collecting grass and selling it OR using it to feed your animals to make a good profit.

3. Wood cutting. You can take out whats called a ""Dangle Head"" tree cutter that will cut down and cut up a tree into logs to fit onto a wood trailer to transport them to a log cutting facility, or alternatively you can crunch up the logs into chips and sell them at the heating plant.

4. Taking care of animals. This comes down from #2 where you can take care of cows, sheep, or pigs in order to produce manure from pigs and cows to help with #1. Sheep only take water and grass in order to produce wool which can be transported to a spinnery for good profit. Cows are a bit more difficult but quite rewarding in the long run but are fed a mixture of silage, grass, and straw along with water. Pigs, to be honest, I don't mess with them only because I don't feel the need, but theres a whole guide explaining what you need to do with caring for animals.

If you don't really find much of that appealling then lets go over some features that were added since FS 15.

1. Built in Mod Hub. Yes this game offers a built in mod menu with a ton of mods made by the community.

2. Free dumping of crops or seed or whatever. This means that if you got a trailer full of lets say, wheat, you can dump it pretty much where ever you want and pick it back up later, this applies to all things that can be put in a tipper.

3. Enhanced graphics. I know that the graphics in most cases aren't that much different from FS 15 but there is a noticable improvement that makes the game feel more alive. Plus better attention to detail when it comes to the tractors and equipment.

4. More tractors and equipment such as Fendt, Challenger, and Massey Ferguson. And larger equipment such as the Amazone Condor sowing machine that has a massive span of 15m compared to earlier games such as FS 15 with the Horsche Pronto sower being the biggest in that game with having a span of only 9m.

In conclusion, I think this game is great if you are looking to relax and learn a little bit on certain activities played by real farmers around the world. Theres a ton more features that I can think of but would just make this review too long if I go more.",1497404852,1497404917,True,381,6,0.932358503341674805,4,True,False,False
