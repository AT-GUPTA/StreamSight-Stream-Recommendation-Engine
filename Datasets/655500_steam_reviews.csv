It's less of a game than it is a physics toy box. There are some rudimentary tracks and bikes available, but the community more than makes up for it as well as the lack of offline bot opponents. The bike packs at mxb-mods.com are a must for online play.

I've recently, at just over 90 hours, tried MX Bikes on a WMR headset and it is an amazing experience as of February 2024. Yes, a keyboard and mouse is necessary through all of the flat menus and gameplay is performed with the same ol' XB1S controller, but the immersion is deliriously fun. Tweaking the POV pitch and tilt to around half really encourages a naturalistic head turn into turns and up or down hills.

Good game & all, just would not stop crashing for the life of it. I spent 118 minutes out of the return period trying to fix the crashing problem to no avail before i refunded to steam. 

I don't know if it was just a me thing? or. None the less, it is what it is.

Or is this suppose to be a strictly VR game? It doesn't make any sense why the game has controller options but they are awful by default

For the first time ever, the game felt very good and intuitive because of 0 lean help (everyone that plays this game competitively should know what that is). This setting change led me to nearly being fast enough to actually compete at the pro level. With a few weeks of training, I would probably be there, and now it's banned.

I can't describe how mad this makes me. There is finally a way to a really good game feeling, and it's getting destroyed. Why the heck would you do that? All this reasoning about it not being realistic, the game would get too arcadey – no, it doesn't. The game never was realistic enough to reason like that, and if I watch my riding in a replay, it actually looks more realistic in my opinion.

But hey, what does the word of the community mean in this game? I am not the only one thinking like that, and it's sad that we just get ignored, and the word of a few people has more power than ours.",1678305722,1705964909,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The default Steam Install just doesn't have them and this game has a vary nice official Discord for us players to find people to interact with when you want, right here at: https://discord.gg/mx-bikes
 
This game is a must have for PC users because it has endless amount of updated tracks people are creating, and site has extra bike patches giving you 30 or more extra Bike's to download and site has extra Rider and bike color and design gear. 

The Controller settings, I can't get over how much extra settings this game has!. You can slow up or speed up your sensitivity controls to your liking, you will never see any game having these amount of sensitive settings that make this game a dream come true to have!. 

If you ever plan to play in 3rd person view you will wanna slow down your Direct lean and have under your advanced controls, under the Advanced Lean to enable the Smooth Press and if you play in 1st person you will have your Direct Lean Higher and Lean Smooth press off. If you find your self lifting the bike front wheel into a crash too much just go to your settings and Under Advanced Throttle settings and Enable the throttle Smooth Press and set it much higher to help you keep the front bike wheel down as you throttle and it can help keep the bike stable to you learn to get faster, and make sure to Sit down on the bike for the corners and when you ride off the jumps sit sometimes, and make sure to stand on the bike just before you land or you will bounce your bike into a crash.

Here is a good tip...make sure when you play around with your throttle trigger settings on your controller by pressing your Right analog trigger up and down to help you find the right adjustment settings to use while you are setting up your throttle sensitivity under (Advanced Throttle, Linearity and Smooth Press, adjustment settings, and your Lean Linearity settings is best at 150% and Lean Gain settings at least 88% or a little higher but not too low or can't make them corners or making it too high or you will fall over when you corner while making them turns often. 
This game will not work right if you use keyboard because you need the sensitive analog throttle triggers and the Left thumb stick on the controllers has sensitive lean stick controls, no keyboard that I know of has this.",1601823328,1705829237,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

Every time I come back and give it another go there is maybe a few things better and the bad things get worse. Granted I only use the current updates of the OEM mods like everyone else it just keeps getting worse. Tires / suspension are garbage constantly tipping uncontrollably side to side then going from all the grip to no grip with no middle ground then the front tire grabs the ground and flips you over. Its actually harder to ride slow then it is to go fast until u hit a weird bump and it kills itself. I've lost hope in this game.

1/18/24
Since the v0.18.3a OEM bike pack this game has been considerably better and they finally addressed a lot of the issues that plagued the game. Suspension got a big upgrade awhile back with OEM 0.18 and the latest update of it had a huge tire change which imo is game changing. I can finally find some consistency in riding and I find myself now having fun and not cursing at this game the entire time. On top of the OEM team doing a great job with the bikes today beta 18 J is out and I think it complements it amazingly. I'm not saying everything is perfect but I am now confident in changing my review from a do not recommend, to a definitely recommend and I hope it keeps going in this direction cause I'm actually enjoying ripping around and not having to ride around weird physics.

The learning curve feels real. The physics (most of the time) feel real. The First Person experience is better than any dirt bike game I have played previously. This game also has an incredibly passionate community, and essentially this game is a template for modders/track builders to create whatever they want. 

Only complaint is that the physics can be goofy at times. If you land flat off a big jump/overjump, you are going to bounce to the sky box. Now, the new OEM bikes have attempted to fix this issue, but they can only do so much. Same with going up hills in this game. While the community has done a great job limiting the goofier physics aspects of this game, PiBoSo still needs to make an effort to fix these issues. Game has a lot of potential and this is the main thing holding it back imo.

But it needs to be understood this game is hard. The first 20 or so hours are literally going to be you just trying to get around a track without crashing 30 times. But once your able to do that it an amazing experience. 

Let me put is this way. If I have over 30 hours into a game, that means a really enjoy it. And with Mx bikes I've put a few more then 30 hours into it.

People need to give it a couple hours and I'm telling you this is hands down the best MX game available. The track degradation alone is amazing when you are hot lapping a track. 

I started in third person to get a feel for what the rider was doing and after about an hour, I switched to first person and haven't looked back. 

Give this game a a few hours and you will see why some people have over a thousand hours in it. 

Ps. The mods may seem daunting but their are a ton of YouTube tutorials on how to install them. It's actually really easy and the amount of free content is unbelievable not to mention it's incredible quality.

Cons- The base bike of the game has really bad traction making it hard to take corners which there is a lot of in this game. And if you want to get more bikes you have to get mods but there is no workshop for this game, you have to go to a website and download them there are put them into the mod folder in the game which is kinda hard and I have not figured that out yet even after watching a video on how to do it. (Don't take this section to seriously because I have only been playing this game for about 3 hours at the time of posting this review)


Pros- It is a good dirt bike game that can run of most computers now I don't have a graphics card and I can run this fine and my computer isn't top of the line. The maps that come with the game are big and have a lot of jumps and turns for you to do. I say that if you play the game without getting any mods you will be happy. And the process of getting the mods for more maps is much easier that getting mods for more bikes.

In the end this game is still pretty good but just not for me.",1704497638,1704497638,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

One thing,
I don't know why,
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind,
I designed this rhyme,
To explain in due time,
All I know,
Time is a valuable thing,
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings,
Watch it count down 'till the end of the day,
The clock ticks life away,
It's so unreal,
You didn't look out below,
Watch the time go right out the window,
Trying to hold on,
Didn't even know, I wasted it all,
Just to watch you go,
I kept everything inside,
And even though I tried,
It all fell apart,
What it meant to me
Will eventually be,
A memory of a time, when ,

I tried so hard and got so far,
But in the end,
It doesn't even matter,
I had to fall,
To lose it all,
But in the end,
It doesn't even matter,

One thing, i don't know why,
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind,
I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself
How I tried so hard...
In spite the way you were mocking me,
Acting like i was part of your property,
Remembering all the times you fought with me,
I'm surprised it got so far,
Things aren't the way they were before,
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore,
Not that you knew me back then,
But it all comes back to me,
In the end...
I kept everything inside,
And even though I tried
it all fell apart,
What it meant to me, will,
Eventually, be a memory of a time when, I tried so hard and got so far,
But in the end,
It doesn't even matter,
I had to fall,
To lose it all,
But in the end,
It doesn't even matter,

I've put my trust in you,
Pushed as far as I can go,
For all this,
There's only one thing you should know,

I've put my trust in you,
Pushed as far as i can go,
For all this,
There's only one thing you should know...

This game is only able to play on PC with controller so make sure you have one. Even though this game may seem to cost way too much, it is going to reward you with countless hours of playtime, once you get the controls down. And be sure to download some mods because they make your experience so much better. I recommend searching up ""MX Bikes OEM Pack"" and downloading that. It will make your experience so much better because of all of the real dirt bikes they offer. You can search a tutorial on Youtube on how to download it and save it into the game.

I've alt-f4 out of it more than any other game I own, it's made me want to put my controller through the monitor.  Steeeepp learning curve, clunky software, meh graphics, not user intuitive AT ALL, no tutorials and unplayable without mods. But its the most fun and rewarding game I own at the moment. I hate it, but I also love and can't stop playing it.

Update- its fundamentally broken in far too many ways, the bikes continue to feel like the have beach balls for tires, and the track feels like a trampoline. I'm sure I will keep playing because for all it gets wrong it does a lot right that no other MX game to date has. However more often than not I quit the game due to all the inconsistencies it has, and most importantly because I'm not having any fun what-so-ever. If you hate fun, love being frustrated, and throwing your hands up in the air thinking ""what in the actual f is that about?"" then this is a game for you, otherwise steer clear. It's unfortunate the moto community deserves better than anything the video game industry has provided us yet.

Most servers rely on the 'OEM Pack' bikes, which are great and well made for being entirely free, but between the bikes updating, and the game physics updating, you will sometimes start the game up, and suddenly it feels like you're playing it all wrong. Updates aren't frequent, but when they happen they generally change how the game feels to a large degree.

This digital masterpiece, crafted with an unwavering commitment to realism and unparalleled attention to detail, redefines the very essence of off-road biking experiences.

Graphics That Set New Standards (5/5):
From the moment you twist the throttle, MX Bikes thrusts you into a visually stunning world. The meticulously crafted graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. Every inch of the meticulously designed bike models and intricately detailed terrains evoke an authentic sense of being on the track. Dynamic weather effects add another layer of realism, making each race a sensory delight.

Gameplay Mastery (5/5):
MX Bikes redefines the concept of motorcycle simulation. It doesn't just simulate the act of riding; it replicates the art of mastering a two-wheeled beast. The physics engine, a work of genius, ensures that every twist of the throttle, every weight shift, and every jump demand your skill and precision. Success in MX Bikes is not handed to you; it's earned through hard-earned mastery of your virtual machine. Controls are intuitively responsive, whether you're using a gamepad or a high-end racing wheel.

A World of Possibilities (4.5/5):
The game's content is as diverse as the terrains you'll ride on. MX Bikes offers a generous selection of tracks and bikes, but the true richness lies in its passionate modding community. A universe of user-created content, including tracks, bikes, and customization options, extends the game's longevity and keeps every race fresh and exciting.

Multiplayer Magic (4/5):
Competing against real players in MX Bikes takes the thrill to a whole new level. The multiplayer aspect is a heart-pounding experience, where your skills are put to the test against riders from around the world. However, a slightly less populous multiplayer scene might result in longer wait times between races, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme of this exceptional game.

Unmatched Realism (5/5):
What sets MX Bikes leagues apart from the competition is its relentless pursuit of realism. The physics simulation is an engineering marvel, capturing the nuances of real-world biking with astonishing accuracy. Every aspect, from tire wear to suspension tuning, and bike setup, mirrors the intricacies of real motocross. MX Bikes is not just a game; it's a simulator that blurs the lines between the digital realm and the mud-spattered, heart-pounding world of off-road racing.

Conclusion:
MX Bikes isn't just a game; it's an immersion into the heart-pounding world of off-road motorcycle racing. Its awe-inspiring graphics, precise gameplay, rich content offerings, and an unwavering commitment to realism make it a standout in the genre. While the multiplayer scene might benefit from more participants, it's the single-player experience, the vibrant modding community, and the level of detail that propel MX Bikes into a league of its own. If you're a motorcycle racing enthusiast seeking an authentic, heart-thumping experience, MX Bikes is your ticket to a world where the line between virtual and reality blurs into oblivion. This game is a work of art, a true masterpiece of two-wheeled artistry.",1698702892,1698702892,True,1,0,0.459016382694244385,0,True,False,True

mxBikes is hands down the best motorcycle game I've ever played!

As a big fan of motorcycling, I've tried several motorcycle games over the years, but none of them come close to the experience offered by mxBikes. The game provides an incredibly realistic feel for riding a motorcycle, which is both challenging and rewarding.

One of mxBikes' major strengths lies in its graphics and sound effects. The motorcycles look incredibly detailed, and the environments are beautifully designed. The sound effects enhance the overall experience, immersing me in the roar of the engines and the ambient sounds of the surroundings, truly making me feel like I'm on the race tracks.

The game's versatility is also noteworthy. You can choose from a variety of motorcycle models, each with its own unique features and handling. There are tracks with different difficulty levels suitable for both beginners and experienced players. Moreover, the game offers a wide range of modes, including single-player, multiplayer, and time trials, keeping me entertained for hours.

The control system is intuitive and responsive, making it easy and enjoyable to learn the game. The developers have clearly put a lot of time and effort into achieving the realistic sensation of motorcycling, and it shows in the quality of the game.

What sets mxBikes apart even further is how incredibly easy it is to set up mods, including new motorcycles and maps. The ability to customize and enhance the game with user-created content adds a whole new layer of excitement and keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The modding community for mxBikes is vibrant and supportive, making it a breeze to find and install new content, enhancing the game's replayability immensely.

All in all, mxBikes is an absolute gem among motorcycle games. Whether you're a motorcycle enthusiast or just someone looking for a realistic and enjoyable racing experience, this game is definitely worth checking out. I can't recommend it enough!",1698649065,1698649065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Modding support is amazing and overall the game is a great motorcross sim. It's still in early access title so the usual bugs and lack of polish is there. I had quite a lot of issues getting multiplayer to work at first. Thankfully the community has so much info out there and public discords with people down to help that it wasn't to bad getting it all working. Once you get past the steep learning curve and get accustomed with the community and modding scene it becomes a super fun unique experience. Piboso physics defiantly get weird at times and have their issues but there isn't really any other game that comes close to a true Mx sim like this other than Mx simulator which is similar, though it's a lot older and I haven't played it so I cant really compare or offer insight into which one would be more worth investing into.",1655996181,1696874029,True,7,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,True

Pros
- Modding community
- track selection
- game doesn't crash
- Can be addictive in the right conditions
Cons
- Modding Community
- Terrible Physics
- Absolutely no way to tell what is actually causing you to crash
- People with 1000+ hours will complain about ""Piboso things"" in relation to weird physics
- Game isn't complete and probably won't ever be complete
- Only has testing and online racing with people who will wreck you and the netcode is terrible

To elaborate, the game has the real sense that it could be great. At first you will play it and realize that its very hard and that you need to practice to get better. The online community will tell you that you need 50 hours in order to make a few laps without crashing. The problem is, this never really gets better. Sure you will get more consistent and crash less, but the random crashes and weird slow/uphill physics, and the bad suspension  no matter what bike mod you use, WILL and I mean WILL ruin races and ruin your fun. The problem is there is too much going on. You have to control the bike steering as well as leaning (and this is normal in motorcross games) however in this one if you don't have them aligned just perfectly you will crash. CONSTANTLY! And the problem is, there is nothing really to show you or help you ""feel"" when you are about to crash. You have to do it based on visual position of your helmet, and hundres and hundres of hours to be able to generally ""memorize"" how to do everything. Thats not fun. Its terribly annoying. It will make you want to punch a wall. They tried to make a pure simulation, but the problems are too complex to solve well with a controller and no other ways to tell what is going on. At least in sim racing we have FFB, you dont get that in MX Bikes. The game will probalby never be out of a beta state, and the modding community (though great) is a pain to work with. Loading files, updating files, all to find out that the bikes still have the same underlying problems because its how the physics work. Piboso should imo have found a better balance between sim and game where you could actually control the bikes and better riders would have better lap times, but not going as far as they did. The way the made the game, 90% of people who try it will uninstall it after a week...Its that inconsistent and difficult in all the wrong ways...",1696188195,1696188195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can with confidence tell you that I've had my up's and down's with this game, but once you learn the physics and understand the basics of them, it feels absolutely amazing. I would point out that there are some bugs with objects on the ground like tyres, logs and walls that the physics of the game definitely doesn't like at all, also minor bugs in terms of going slow on a bike, which of course is expected when buying a beta version of a non-completed game. Therefore, i would totally recommend this and only this game, if you are a dirtbike enthusiast who can't get enough of fast dirtbikes, wether it is supercross, motocross, supermoto or even streetriding!",1693245688,1693245688,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And personally every single whip is so satisfying and has me watching each replay with excitement. 
To master this game is hard and will take time, but the outcome is extremely satisfying and is highly recommended.

When you buy the game you only get the stock PiBoSo bikes, and tracks. However, we have a HUGE mod community that keeps this game fresh, and fun to play. The OEM guys release new OEM bikes year in and year out, while many others make great tracks for us all to play. There is also a huge racing scene, with many series from fun races, to full blown pro series with dedicated members of this community making tracks, live streaming, and prize pools. If you enjoy riding IRL, or just want to have fun on a dirt bike, I highly recommend you get this game. It will be frustrating at first, but if you put in the time, you will get better, and have loads of fun. Aside from MX & SX, there is also a enduro scene, with OEM bikes, IRL tracks, and much more. Almost 80% of the mods for the game are free, but if you want to support creators, and get exclusive bikes and tracks, you can do so.  I will recommend that you have a decent amount of storage as all the mods do start to take up space. Other than that, I hope this review is helpful, and you decide to buy the game.",1689820580,1689820580,True,48,1,0.823809325695037842,2,True,False,True

Price: Initially, I found the AUD $49 price tag hard to justify, and I contemplated whether the game was worth it. In my opinion, the game should be priced around $30. However, I can say with certainty that regardless of the cost, MX Bikes is undeniably a worthwhile investment. It has earned its reputation as the GMOD of its genre, offering a plethora of fresh, community-made content such as bikes, gear, and tracks. Even the base game, with its included bikes and tracks, provides a solid 10 hours of exploration and a true taste of the game.

Physics: The physics in MX Bikes are nothing short of incredible. Playing in the first-person perspective, which is the preferred choice for most players, delivers an immersive experience like no other essentially 1:1 like on a real bike. However, I did notice that the third-person perspective makes the rider appear stiff, and the overall game-play feels somewhat heavy and unnatural (a personal preference). But fear not, as the satisfaction of flawlessly greasing through set of whoops compensates for any shortcomings.

Settings: It is important to note that the initial settings in MX Bikes may not be the most beginner-friendly. When I first loaded the game, I immediately looked into the settings because I struggled to even start the bike. I recommend taking the time to tweak the automated settings, such as clutch, ABS, rider lean, and sitting position. YouTube can be your best friend here, as it provides valuable insights from experienced players and helps you establish a starting point for your own preferences. Experimentation is key, yet don't hesitate to draw inspiration from professional players' settings.

Comparison: I must stress that MX Bikes is not MX Sim, and I made the mistake of assuming they were similar. However, this turned out to be one of the best mistakes I've made (excluding my son). MX Bikes stands tall in its own right, offering an exceptional gaming experience that deserves recognition.

Conclusion: I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing MX Bikes, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, you always have the option to refund. Keep in mind that the game is still in early access, but that shouldn't deter you from giving this awesome game a chance. The overall feel, physics, variety of bikes and tracks, and the vibrant community are all aspects that make MX Bikes truly awesome. Give it a few hours, find your groove, and you'll walk away with an 500 litres of dopamine in your system.",1635230596,1688470877,True,2,1,0.498928189277648926,0,True,False,True

Practice a lot! It is very rewarding when you ride right! The 2023 bikes seem way good but must you must download them with an update. Overall very good game if you are into racing bikes!

There are not many tracks in the original game and the bikes don't feel great, which means you have to install mods. The online is not great at all, there is a lobby with many servers, which I appreciate, but the netcode is not the best, it takes a big time to load, sometimes you get a mismatch cause mods are old/have been updated, etc. There are no online leaderboards...

When you hear about simulators, obviously you hear ""MX Sim"", but you also hear ""MX Bikes"". Known for being an easier sim game to get into than MX Sim and with a modding community just as good. I myself don't have MX Sim, but I can only assume both of these games have their pros and cons. So lets talk about the pros and cons.
Pros:
1 Very realistic physics (most the time)
2 Very versatile modding community
3 Decently optimized for low end devices (what I own myself)
Cons:
1 Bad low speed physics most the time
2 ""Piboso Physics Moment"" quite frequently happening (ex: casing a jump and doing 3 backflips)
3 Game updates that break all mods. These updates normally are to make the stock Piboso bikes ride better, but everyone uses the OEM bikes so its just unnecessary updates.

Controls still keep remapping to the pause button, forcing a restart every 5-10 minutes. If you visit the Unity Asset Store, you can very easily find the asset the developer flipped - all they did was add some tracks and skins to hide the fact they flipped an asset by doing little to no work. This game needs to be removed from steam. DO NOT PURCHASE.

Original review: Fix the serious bugs or lower your price - 35 is way too high. REALLY fun game, but REALLY buggy. After about 20 minutes of playing, the controls unmap themselves and swap buttons. Lots of other bugs. Gotta constantly restart to play this game.

Mx Bikes is an exhilarating motocross game that offers an authentic and immersive two-wheeled racing experience. Developed by PiBoSo, this simulation-based game takes you on a thrilling ride through challenging tracks, realistic physics, and an extensive customization system.

One of the standout features of Mx Bikes is its attention to detail when it comes to physics and bike handling. The game captures the essence of motocross racing with its realistic bike dynamics, including weight shifting, suspension behavior, and tire grip. The controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing you to feel the adrenaline rush as you navigate through jumps, corners, and rough terrain.

The track selection in Mx Bikes is impressive, offering a variety of environments such as outdoor motocross tracks, supercross arenas, and even off-road trails. Each track is meticulously designed with attention to detail, providing a sense of realism and challenge. The terrain is dynamic and responsive to your actions, which adds an extra layer of excitement to every race.

Customization plays a significant role in Mx Bikes, allowing you to personalize your bike and rider. You can fine-tune your motorcycle's performance by adjusting various parameters like suspension settings, gear ratios, and tire compounds. Additionally, the game features an in-depth bike editor that lets you create your own bikes from scratch, adding a creative touch to the gameplay.

The multiplayer mode in Mx Bikes offers intense online races where you can challenge other players from around the world. It's a thrilling experience to compete against real opponents, testing your skills and strategies. However, the player base can be relatively small compared to more mainstream racing games, which may limit the availability of multiplayer races at times.

While Mx Bikes excels in many areas, there are a few aspects that could be improved. The graphics, while sufficient, are not as polished as some of the top-tier racing games on the market. The audio design could also benefit from more realistic engine sounds and immersive environmental effects.

Overall, Mx Bikes is a fantastic choice for motocross enthusiasts and players looking for a realistic racing experience. Its accurate physics, diverse track selection, and robust customization options make it an engaging and addictive game. With some graphical and audio enhancements, it has the potential to become an even more exceptional motocross simulation.

So if u can imagine urself grinding this game, u should expect the devs to change everything up once in a while for unknown reasons, considering this game has been out for a very long time and the devs still find the need to redo the mechanics, physics and all the technical stuff around the riding experience has left me frustrated since this is/was a good game and better than many other arcade mx games.

So if your not willing to put time into practice. The game will be frustrating and may seem like its to difficult. Obviously your experience may be different from mine depending on your riding experience and time played in other sims. Just keep pushing and it will eventually all click, once you get there its a major thumbs up. I recommend when you first start off to turn all the riding assist in the simulation settings ON. You can still control each of these individual movements or bike controls while the assist are turned on. This will make the game much more enjoyable and you can just one by one turn them off as you get better.

But after you learn to ride this game is SO freaking fun find a track that you can just flow learn manual shifting and this is from a guy who never raced moto in his life but wanted something more realistic and this is it.  

60 hours in still the same feeling love the game.

Lastly download the OEM bikes and just go out there and have fun I am a few hours in and just now able to complete a lap and starting to throw some whips here and there nothing huge but I am having a blast. Try and find a friend or have a friend learn with you makes it so much better.

MX bikes, also known as motocross bikes, are high-performance motorcycles designed for off-road racing on dirt tracks. As a language model, I cannot provide a personal review as I don't have personal experiences or opinions. However, I can share some information about the features and benefits of MX bikes.

MX bikes are known for their powerful engines, lightweight frames, and suspension systems that are designed to handle the rough terrain of off-road racing. These bikes are typically smaller and more agile than other types of motorcycles, allowing riders to navigate tight corners and jump over obstacles with ease.

One of the advantages of MX bikes is their versatility. They can be used for a variety of off-road activities, such as trail riding, enduro racing, and even freestyle motocross. They are also customizable, allowing riders to tailor the bike to their individual preferences and riding style.

Another benefit of MX bikes is the physical and mental challenge they provide. Riding an MX bike requires a great deal of physical endurance, balance, and coordination. It also requires a high level of mental focus and quick decision-making skills, making it a thrilling and rewarding experience for riders who enjoy pushing themselves to their limits.

However, it is important to note that MX riding can also be dangerous if proper safety precautions are not taken. Riders should always wear protective gear such as helmets, boots, and body armor, and should only ride on designated tracks or trails.

In conclusion, MX bikes offer a thrilling and versatile option for off-road enthusiasts who enjoy a physical and mental challenge. With their powerful engines, lightweight frames, and customizable features, these bikes are a popular choice among riders who seek adrenaline-pumping adventures.",1683152614,1683152614,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,True,True

This is hands down the best motocross game I have ever played. 

The  community has been hit or miss. Sometimes someone is willing to help you, sometimes you get kicked from a server for being better than one racer who decides you deserve to be kicked because you've over taken him, he decides to try and take you out in the next corner and fails, ""Kick Twig"" comes up in chat next thing you know mob mentality kicks in and I'm left browsing the servers for another race.

Top tip for anyone new youtube > search ""Lynds controller set up"" and start from there, follow everything he does on controller settings and it'll feel a hell of a lot easier to ride.

never played a mx sim before so at the first 100 hours were pretty rough, struggling to get one clean lap.
then i started to play online and you see how fast some guys are and how much is possible. the skill gap is insane.

the discord community is great and helpful, the online lobbys on the other hand are a toxic wasteland.
guess that just comes from the nature of the game, they all race like there life depents on it, dont take this shit serious.

the mods make this game so kudos to all of them. 
i would guess 80% is free and more then enough to get you started. 
the stuff thats payed are mostly replica tracks and more for the experienced riders.

TLDR: if you invest the time its alot of fun. buy it

The best mx game of all. 

Graphics might not be cutting edge (use reshader and graphics are damn good though) like some of the competitor games out there. 

-Physics are the best.
-Rut/Terrain deformation is the best (you can change how strong ruts get broken in)
-Bike setup/customization is the best. Nobody else compares. Setup is everything when riding and so it makes sense for a simulator to allow you to customize your bike setup as in depth as MX Bikes does. It's great.

-Mods! You can mod on this MX game, unlike most rival MX games. THat means community tracks, bikes, plugins, and other stuff to boost your gameplay on MX Bikes.

It just feels good once you get through the learning curve. That's all I can say.",1644370546,1680400391,True,0,0,0.494880557060241699,0,True,False,True

It's not worth the price in my opinion, not many tracks, weird looking stock bike and stock riding gear.
So you need to get mods, but they tend to make the game run weird, mod tracks can get funky physics and bikes feel worse.

Developer says there is chassis flex simulation, but I can't see how there is, there doesn't seem to be a bike simulated, just watch 3rd person, it gets super weird. Riding at slow speed, the bike flips around in such an unrealistic way. There doesn't seem to be wheels simulated either.
There are ""deformation"" tracks left, but its just darker dirt, not real terrain deformation as seen in other games.

The game seriously needs rumble for a controller, there is no feed back, no sense of grip, weight on the tyres, hits through the bike. Just the front of the bike to watch and habit.

I gave it 9 hours, could occasionally land a whip, hit most of the tracks, it's not worse then bigger mx games, it's not better.
Wish there was a proper mx game to play when I'm not riding my bike, this isn't it.",1680001974,1680001974,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm sure after many years of playing it'll be fun, but up front its not. Don't buy this game. Just stick to the other dirt bike games where you can enjoy yourself for the $50 you spend. This game is for hardcore people who have put in way too much time to enjoy a single game. Just my honest opinion. 

On another note, the game doesn't run very well on the i7-12 gen 3050 laptop so that kind of sucks. It is what it is.

As a fan of motorsports, I have always been drawn to racing games, but MX Bikes takes it to a whole new level. There are several reasons why I love this game, and in this essay, I will elaborate on those reasons.

Firstly, the graphics and sound effects in MX Bikes are outstanding. The bikes are incredibly detailed, and the tracks are realistic, with different surfaces such as mud, sand, and gravel. The game's audio is also top-notch, with engine sounds that accurately replicate the roar of a real motocross bike. When I'm playing MX Bikes, I feel like I'm actually at the track, racing alongside the other riders.

Another reason why I love MX Bikes is the level of customization it offers. There are many options for tuning your bike, from adjusting the suspension to changing the gear ratios. I love tinkering with my bike's settings, trying to find the perfect setup that will give me an edge over my opponents. The game also has a wide range of customizable graphics, allowing me to create a unique look for my bike and rider.

The gameplay in MX Bikes is also excellent. The physics engine is very realistic, which means that the bike handles like a real motocross bike. The controls are precise, and I feel like I have complete control over my bike. This level of control is essential in a racing game, and it's something that MX Bikes does exceptionally well.

The game also has a great selection of tracks, with different layouts and challenges. From the tight turns of a supercross track to the jumps and bumps of an outdoor motocross track, each track presents a unique challenge. I love exploring each track, finding the fastest lines and trying to beat my previous lap times.

Finally, one of the things that I love most about MX Bikes is the sense of community that surrounds it. The game has a dedicated community of players who are passionate about motocross and racing. There are online races and tournaments, as well as forums where players can discuss the game and share tips and strategies. It's great to be a part of such an active and supportive community.

In conclusion, MX Bikes is an exceptional motocross racing game that offers a fantastic gaming experience. The graphics and sound effects are outstanding, the level of customization is impressive, and the gameplay is excellent. The game's sense of community is also something that I value, and it adds to the overall enjoyment of playing MX Bikes. If you're a fan of motorsports and racing games, I highly recommend giving MX Bikes a try.",1679084939,1679084939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is not for the faint-hearted. It's a challenging dirt bike simulator that requires patience, persistence, and skill. The learning curve is steep, and it can be frustrating at times. But once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly rewarding. The graphics and physics are realistic, and the mod community adds even more tracks and challenges to the game.

The game's physics engine is highly realistic and accurately models the behavior of bikes, tires, and suspension systems, making for an authentic and satisfying gameplay experience.

The game's controls are also highly detailed and require a lot of skill to master. Players must manage their bike's weight distribution, adjust their speed and trajectory, and choose the right gear for each section of the track. This level of control is both challenging and rewarding, as it allows players to truly feel like they're in control of their bike and competing at the highest level.

One of the game's strongest features is its track selection. MX Bikes features a wide variety of tracks, from outdoor motocross circuits to indoor supercross tracks. Each track has its own unique layout and terrain, and players must adjust their strategy and riding style accordingly. The game also has support for custom tracks and mods, which adds even more variety and replay value.

The game's graphics are also impressive, with highly detailed bike models and environments that look and feel like real-world motocross tracks. The sound design is also top-notch, with realistic engine sounds and environmental effects that add to the immersion.

The game's multiplayer support is also worth mentioning, as it allows players to compete against each other online and test their skills against a global community of MX Bikes players.

One downside to the game is its learning curve. The controls and physics are highly realistic, but this means that they can be difficult to master, especially for players who are new to the genre. However, with practice and patience, players can gradually improve their skills and become more competitive.

Overall, MX Bikes is an excellent motocross simulation game that offers a highly realistic and immersive experience for fans of the sport. With its impressive physics, detailed controls, wide variety of tracks, and multiplayer support, MX Bikes is a must-play for any motocross enthusiast.",1678479447,1678479447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
