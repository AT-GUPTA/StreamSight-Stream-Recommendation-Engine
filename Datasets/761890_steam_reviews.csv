Verdict: Amazing game for PvPers, especially if you're familiar with The Wilds from Runescape. Wide variety of skill choice and easy customization not being class bound. One character can try all weapons and it feels encouraged to swap regularly for what you're doing. Even as mostly a PvE player, I got good time from it. Which is where the personal drawback comes in. PvE content was not in it's original design. PvE dungeons were added later, though you can't really tell now. This does mean it's fairly shallow content. Dungeons quickly get repetitive and you start to realize the excitement of the game comes from PvP. It did feel great stomping an invader of my dungeon into the ground though. This also leads to shallow tactics too though, like waiting until you're almost dead to gank you. Either way, it's free to play. Give it a try, it's learning curve isn't high but it does seem overwhelming at first. Overall I'd say a great game which does exactly what it set out to do, even if it's not for me in the long run. This will be one of the few remaining territory control type MMOs which... Actually are worth anything, that didn't fail outright, gimped during production, or pay to win. 


Classes system which your abilities come from which armor and weapon you choose. Many weapon types which all progress into specializing into specific subweapon skill trees, all weapons having different abilities attached to each weapon in the same weapon category. You'll find yourself selecting specific types of the chosen weapon to get the skill set you want. The only restriction is having to skill up weapon types to access higher tiers. Armor and crafting is the same way. Outside of mob drops, all items are player crafted. Mob drops drop a variety of crafted gear. So gathering and crafting have a dedicated purpose. Markets are also local, meaning no global AH. Different areas have different markets based on regional resources/guild control.  

Which leads me to the defining part of the game: Open world PvP. If you're PvE mostly, don't run yet. I enjoy PvP but am mostly a casual PvE player. The appeal of this game is a massive, persistent world with full loot PvP. The best design feature, though, is the progression of this full loot system. In the beginner you'll start at a town in a safe zone. You'll be in safe zones for a bit while you get use to the game. These PvE only zones are call, and visibly seen on the map, as blue zones. They will mostly only provide starter resources and some minor PvE to get your combat skills started. As you progress you'll enter into yellow zones. These zones players can flag up and attack other players. In yellow zones you only get knocked out and lose item durability. Very low risk, compared to blues non-existant risk. Resources will gradually get better with each zone, as risk increases so does reward. Next are Red zones. By this point you should be comfortable enough with combat and this will be the deciding point if you stick with the game further (Unless you're like me and just camp arena pvp in town). Red zones are where full loot PvP comes in. In red zones you still need to flag for PvP to engage in it, though player killing is full loot now. Lastly are black zones, these zones require no flagging and are full loot PvP. These zones are where guild fight over territories. There are guild warfare seasons which happen, letting guilds gain points for this warfare to gain different rewards. 

If you're interested in PvE the main content are the dungeons. They still carry risk though. When you open a dungeon and start to clear it, you can be invaded. The zone color dictates how death works or if it's full loot or not. A majority of my time was having fun in Yellow zones with little contest. Yellow has pretty easy gear to rebuild if you've lost a full loot fight and have no bank backup. This game uses 'tiers' to denote item strength/rarity. Yellow dungeon drops cap out at tier 5 out of a total of 8 tiers. This mean it is very easily to quickly get back to a decent fighting range with little effort. Most of my time was spent doing dungeons in yellow areas, hoarding items, selling items at a major city and fairly quickly got to the point I had plenty of coin to buy and try tier 4-7 equipment. The later tiers locking the subset weapons of a category mentioned earlier. 

Overall their world design and system synergy is great. Crafting facilitates the ability for any new players to start a foothold with low level crafting being very easy and is the base level of the game. This synergizes with the full loot aspect, letting you very easily and quickly regain a simple set of gear to move further into the zones with, yellow being very easy to get back to a good place. Local markets means guilds and players have to transport resources from one area to another, which facilitates PvP. Zone progression eases you in to the PvP system, instead of dropping you into full loot right away. Mounts have a carry limit and different speeds, you can become over-encumbered. Territory wars keep the game alive, facilitating large scale PvP across a huge map, making different zones volatile and rarely the same experience when you go through them depending on the war. 

If you're into the idea, you get a personal island to setup and craft on too.

They need more servers.
That being said i will upgrade my review.

Due to the servers being so lagged I have to rate this a no! It was good at one point till the whole rush to mobile . Once all the mobile users and bots got on the server its just bogged down garbage in the main cities.


Pros:
Resource harvesting
pve questing
pvp
tiered gear to t8

Cons:
need more servers

public dungeons are garbage - only drop loot for one person,
 even though more can be in the instance you have to do the most dps.
Speed hackers will come in the instance to steal your loot chests.

6/10

You grind the massive skill tree to unlock new abilities, better weapons, better armor, etc. By unlocking higher tiers, you enable yourself to protect yourself better, get better resources, and grind more efficiently. But inevitably, you are grinding the same dungeons, bosses, and/or resources. After a while, the only fun comes from the rare times when you open a chest at the end of dungeon and it shows a massive sum of money in the form of gear/resources. 

Albion Online is group PvP orientated:
Why are you grinding? Why of course so that you can crush the plebs. You want to kill people and take their loot. Many times, its a very good way of making money. Also, if you don't grind, then it will be you who is killed and not the other person. The good loot is in high risk areas, where areas like the roads with big group dungeons being run by highly geared players frequently. Other places like hellgates are forced PvP encounters with the winner reaping not only the dead players gear but also the dungeon loot. However, most people run around in massive zergs. With friendly fire not being a thing, this makes solo or small group experiences very difficult. Essentially if you want to progress fast, it comes down to either joining a big guild or becoming a hellgate god. 

Albion Online is a player driven economy experience:
The banks and marketplaces are local. Meaning that you cant go to one cities bank and pickup the loot you dropped of from another city. Also, certain areas are specialized in certain resources (meaning wood or stone will be more or less expensive in certain areas compared to others). This makes for a fun economy system with many people trying to game it to make their millions. 

Honestly? Turn friendly fire to force zergs to be more tactical with their positioning and attacks. This solves a great deal of grievances many people have with the game.

  I have played descent amount of hours, done all possible content and i can tell you one thing about the game that will summarize it. It is basically a PVP game.
   PvE Content is extremely poor. Mobs are repetitive all over the different biomas. Dungeons and ""bosses"" are repetitive too. There are NO quests or story-line. Personal achievements are not a thing, as you cant show no one what have u done. You can be lvl 100 at a skill and no one will ever know, or even care as you have no rewards when getting max lvl. Not even a single item or title. Grinding is really painful, you WILL be grinding for hours to get better materials, and in the end theres nothing, literally nothing. You will grind for Silver or leveling a weapon just to PVP. Skills such as fishing, farming or any of them are extermelly poor in content, no achievement or nothing. And dont even think of going solo, if you are a solo player this games is NOT for you. You will need a clan and 10+ ppl to even enter the last zones availables. 
  Housing system is the most undeveloped thing in the game. You can do NOTHING in your house, just store things, you cant even sit on a chair or try to roll play with friends cause nothing is interactable. 
  So basically this is a PVP game which need hours of grinding to start pvping properly. No roll play, no personal achievements, no nothing. Just PVP and in almost all cases is MASS PVP. So prepare your GPU for some hard work.
  PvP IS nice, skills are fun and theres a lot of variety in classes and weapons. Thats the only good point i can highlight.
So if u want to grind for 200hours+ to pvp this is your game.
  Not recommended at all if you want to have a cool adventure with friends or even solo. Recommended to those willing to grind months to just pvp.

Those people who complain about losing there stuff go into the flagged pvp zones without the approperiate gear or knowledge of how the full loot system works, the majority of zones are safe to die in, Meaning you dont lose your stuff it just gets slightly damaged and you have to repair it which is pretty standard in pretty much any mmo, if you die you have to repair your gear its been around since 2004 when WoW was first released. You only lose your inventory when you go onto Red territories on the map, WHICH when you try to enter pops up a huge window that says, are you sure you want to go into this zone you will lose your gear, so i can only assume the people writing reviews about how its unfair they lost all there tier 5 gear to someone in tier 7 in the red zones, cant actually read. Of course you can go into those zones early without the proper gear, but why would you? you wont need those resources until much later in the game when you can actually fight the people who are in that red zone. Its not a full loot pvp game, It has a few zones that are full loot, Much like the wilderness in OSRS. That being said the pvp is 100x more satisfying than most other sandbox games, The visuals are quirky and smooth. It has crossplay and its on client, Its free to play without any purchases. It has a solid tutorial that teaches you how to play. This game does hold your hand early on but it expects you to have a fully functional frontal lobe to progress and thats reasonable in the year of our lord 2021. Dont be put off by the bad reviews. Its just salty people being salty for overestimating there abilities or being ignorant of how the game actually functions.",1632447522,1632645917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Esse jogo é realmente muito bom, a jogabilidade é muito gostosa, os elementos visuais e sonoros são ótimos, mas o que mais me impressiona com esse jogo são as mecânicas e a economia.
A economia INTEIRA do jogo é player-made, desde os itens que dropam dos monstros e das DGs até os equipamentos que tu vai usar durante 10 minutos e morrer na black zone depois.
Acho que Albion é o jogo mais impossível de ficar entediado no planeta, tu sempre tem alguma coisa nova ou diferente pra fazer, desde ir minerar pedrinha até fazer PvP de absurdamente larga escala (500+ players fácil) que chega impressiona de ver.

The game play and design is spot on. It brings back a lot of memories of long nights playing Ultima Online, pvping, doing corpse runs in the bottom of Despair all that good stuff. 

What it does wrong? It locks some of the ""best"" progress behind poorly designed and implemented game features - such as the atrocity they call an arena. Three times a day you can get really good exp books, which help out skill growth considerably for WINNING in the arena.

This wouldn't be bad except for there is ZERO, NONE, ZILCH balanced match making. My team often finds ourselves, characters with ~120k fame (exp to level your skills AND needed to unlock weapon skills) being matched with teams of people who have 50 million + fame or higher.  If you're going to lock the best progression rewards behind something, at least make an effort to balance it.

The other aspects of the game are also meh at best. RvR, CvC, open world PvP, and the ""PvE"" content they've added is ok, but extremely redundant, making it become tedious and boring. Instead of actually implementing working systems for these, their stance seems to be ""just kill people/person/team/clan to get loot."" I'm not joking, one of the ""Mods"" literally told me to ""just gank people"" when asking about how dungeons work. Seems pretty simple, why work on fixing your game when you can hide your terrible designs behind ""Well you could just kill people.""

The skill system is unique, but I also found it merely skin deep/superficial. Even though you can mix and match gear to make a unique ""build,"" the system is designed poorly in manner where there aren't unique options for different play styles. If you're doing PvP/PvE you'll probably use the same skill(s) as 90% of the other people using your ""weapon class"" as the other skills just have no value.

If you do decide to play, its mandatory to play with a group of friends or join a larger clan. I was really hoping to like the game given the Ultima Online vibes I got from it, but I only found the appeal was skin deep as the content is severely lacking.",1622123122,1622185076,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Queue to enter game, 1500 people before me.
This, paired with how premium works at high levels, forcing you to have it and to farm silver to get it (unless you want to throw away your real life money), turns the ""Play it"" into an ""Avoid it"".
Luckily I was going to play this again just while I waited for stuff like New World and Fractured to come out.

***** ***** *****

Old Review, before returning after a long pause:

Well well, it's time for a review!
Long story short, would I recommend this game? Totally yes.
Of course you must like grinding, because this game is all about grinding. You skill up what you use (I love it) and the farther you go, the harder it gets to master new levels (I love it). You can't do everything in an easy way, since skilling up everything to the top requires more than a couple of human lives (or maybe not, I haven't really given it a try, but I love it) so you have to specialize and group up with others that have other skills.
The game offers various possible activities, ranging from gathering, refining, crafting, farmin, to mob killing, players killing, dungeon diving, little PvP skirmishes, arena, larger GvG fights up to massive ZvZ. Plus side: new contents are regularly added to the game with no cost (take that, World of Warcraft, where you pay monthly subscription AND you pay expansions).
Paying is an option but it gives out cosmetics or premium status, which can be acquired anyway with farmed silver. At first I thought one would not be able to sustain a premium account for free with only earned silver, now I proved myself wrong activating 3 months of premium and gathering enough silver for another 3 months in less than a month. Do the math!
Players can gather in guilds to hold bigger objectives unavailable to solo players. Guilds can gather in alliances to hold even bigger objectives.
The economy is almost totally player driven, there is almost no item in game that has not been crafted by someone somehow (did I mention that I love it?).
Different zones offer different resources levels but also increased risks as in red and black zones you can be full looted by other players when killed.
The starting price is absolutely fair given the potentially infinite time this game will let you enjoy (or not enjoy, when you get brutally ganked and full looted).
There are always free keys on the internet to test out the game for 7 days so you can even see it by yourself before spending anything!

I think Albion's greatest strength is that there is a wealth of content and ways to play, but the mechanics are extremely easy to understand. Getting into an mmo can be incredibly overwhelming and confusing, but Albion is very friendly to new players. However, only venture into this game if you like rpgs with a skill for EVERYTHING. That is where the crafting grind comes in. You will need several skills unlocked just to complete simple gathering tasks.

I've been with the MoneyGuild and such high up guilds before, and they just use you to be straight up blunt with you.

I am a ""beta veteran"" player, since ""Galahad"" one. I survived a wipe and plenty of major updates, so I am pretty much aware of the direction that SBI developers have chosen for their game. I misunderstood the concept initially and there were absolutely no content provided for solo players like me, so I was quite disappointed. Not speaking of massive removal of cool in-game mechanics that have already been implemented – quests, mob fractions loyalty, unrestricted PvP without any crutch de-buff mechanics that feel out of place, open world building & astonishing world design. Most of post-launch patches were targeting group aspect of the game, supporting guild-oriented content, so this game got boring for me very soon.

At this moment a lot of patches has been deployed to stable servers, including the latest one - The roads of avalon. It is getting more clear that developers are trying to satisfy all different categories of players independently of what play style they follow. There is a place for solo players now. A place for casual players who not able to spend eternity farming for their guild as a slaves and then going to mandatory ZvZ. ""Forge your destiny"" - they say, and it is finally truth. No matter which kind of activity you prefer, you will get enough gameplay hours that you can enjoy. And there is more to come - SBI keep their playerbase in touch with their plans and game roadmap vision. The best thing about Albion is that in sandbox genre there is infinite potential to grow,, and SBI team will not averse to use it, even years after the launch.

It is still has downsides. Some of non-combat activities are feeling abandoned and devs simply not putting any effort in that direction. I know they will change it one day, improve and make it better. It will just take some time. SBI keeping their priorities smart, and at the moment they actively targeting new players and reduce entry threshold so more players will decide to keep playing. That's ok. They are getting a huge boost in population now which is mean they are reaching their goals. And their next goal is to improve the royal continent and fraction warfare, focusing mostly on improving what we currently have rather than putting even more new stuff. I can't wait for a new developer's journal coming out on their official youtube channel, each announcement they make is like a second new year - always exciting and long awaited. This game is worth your time and even money investment - if you interested in giving devs some real support, the best thing to do is to use their official client from their website rather that using steam platform.

P.S. This game has its own ""Brighton beach"" in game. It is Infernal Scythe users. I don't know why, but most of the time when you kill player with that specific weapon, you will definitely get some blame in russian language in your direct messages, pls someone explain why is that always happening",1526481128,1600529568,True,1,0,0.511312186717987061,101,True,False,False

tl;dr: its definitely worth looking into and trying out to see if its for you

For awhile I've been trying to pin down exactly what it is that I'm looking for in an mmo and I think ive boiled it down to three things: Risk/Reward, Sense of Progression, Sense of Exploration. This game hits 2/3 for me. There's technically a fourth but we'll get to that later.

In terms of risk/reward: full loot pvp definitely does the trick. Getting more means risking more. I get a little scared every time I go somewhere I know someone can kill me and undo all the work I just did and more. I get a rush every time the risk and effort come together into something tangible. Even narrowly escaping death has its appeal to me. At the same time the risks you take are entirely up to you (to a certain degree, eventually you'll have to take a risk to improve further)

Sense of Progression: Unpopular opinion but I actually don't mind grind especially when it results in your character visually changing. For crafting yourself new gear this game fits the bill quite well. Although i don't quite like how hard it is to actually feel stronger I'm going to give this game the benefit of the doubt and assume that the error there is on me as the player.

Sense of Exploration: This is where it fails for me. The world is huge and its quite diverse visually (although I think the style does detract from this somewhat but in terms of gameplay that's nitpicking). Especially with the portals that lead to dungeons scattering the maps I never felt like the world was at all small or constraining except for where you as the player drew the line (tying back into risk/reward). The problem is that for me it doesn't feel like enough to just have a big world. The things that make exploration feel worthwhile to me just aren't there. Finding a hidden dungeon with rare loot inside occasionally would be cool but the dungeons arent exactly hidden and none of the loot feels particularly rare on account of good gear having to be crafted (which is fine but still). Alternatively interesting lore or NPCs to run into would fit the bill but this game is very light on those kinds of things from what I've experienced. That leaves having interesting players to run into and experience some kind of adventure with leading me to my secret last section.

Community: Yall are some fucking bastards. I remember when I first played this game I joined a guild and when I went offline for awhile to handle course work I'd fallen behind on I was kicked for inactivity and by the time I came back the guild had disbanded. I try coming back online and half the portals and zone entry points have a handful of red players behind them trying to make a quick buck. When I asked for a guild someone told me that nobody is going to sink resources into a noob. This leads me to my conclusion.

Try the game, if you like it then its worth fighting for enough resources to fend for yourself and then finding a guild that you can trust which I assume makes this game 10 times more fun. Even without that I can recommend the game so I hope that says something.

Again tl;dr: its definitely worth looking into and trying out to see if its for you",1588149284,1588149284,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It's not true. This game is actually one of the easiest and casual games I ever played.
I can't describe how boring it is to try to find someone to PK. You have to spend hours and hours to find at least one target. Don't forget about possibility to buy currency of the game for real money right from developers so for who has some money in real life gold in game will never will be a problem. So game economy is in ruins. 

Most of the players run only in T4 or T5 armor. Why is that so? Because there is no need in upgrade further than T4 and T5 stats is almost the same as T7 and T8. Long story short there is no point in PvP.

Maybe this game has fun PvE? Well most of the instances is just the same. Same textures that repeat over and over again. Deja vu of boredoom will be your partner for your entire game experience. Maybe enemies is interesting and unique? Same models of the same monsters but they changed their height and width a little bit (I'm not joking they are that lazy). Maybe interesting story? Does anyone even know it has story? I don't and you know why? Because there is no locations or events that would make me interesting in the world itself. So I played like 300 hours or even more on mine second account. All the time conveniencing myself to play it a little bit more and it will be better! There will be fun PvP and high risks! Then when I figured out that this game is complete garbage without PvP or PvE or Quests or anything that we wait from games of that format... Well... Don't do my mistake. Don't play this ""game"". Buy yourself ice cream bucket or chicken.

Game for casual players to make them ""feel"" hardcore without risks. If anyone saying that Albion is hardcore project then based on what I saw for the same person milk should be hardcore alcohol.

They'll say it's unpleasant dying to groups larger than them, and how if they can't play solo, the game therefore sucks. 

Let me be crystal clear in case the store page isn't clear enough: [b]IT'S A FULL-LOOT PVP MMO.[/b] 

Full loot: When you die, everything you're wearing and anything in your inventory is dropped or trashed. It's written on the doorway outside, if you don't like it don't play it. If I'm allergic to fish, I'm not gonna go to a seafood restaurant and order trout, then post a bad google review saying it almost killed me. 

PvP: Everything in Albion is there to support PvP, which is the strongest aspect of the game. PvE leaves quite a bit to be desired, but in the end it's all used to get stronger for PvP. Groups can literally gank you inside a dungeon/raid and lay waste to you. It's called diving, and it's awesome. Totally possible to fight back and win as well, it happens all the time. If you are not someone who enjoys plentiful amounts of consensual / non- consensual PvP, this is not the game for you, keep looking elsewhere. 

MMO: I won't patronize you by explaining this here, but this game as well as other MMOs are designed specifically to play with other people. Playing solo in this game is definitely possible, but it takes a great amount of patience and practice, as well as a deep understanding of gear interactions and game mechanics. These are things you'll learn if you just join a damn guild. Don't be scared to be social in an MMO, there are plenty of great guilds out there for beginners and veterans alike. Start in a guild at least, there are so many people willing to help newer players even in competitive high-stakes games like Albion. Some guy posted a review saying most guilds require you to pay them to get in????? I've never seen this in my almost 2k hours, but maybe I haven't looked at enough trash/scam guilds. 

With all that being said, the game is great. For me, I could never get into theme-park MMOs. I played Rust since legacy, and dabbled a bit in EVE online. I also played a lot of league back in the day. I like to think I've grown since then, but I digress. If you really want to compare Albion to anything else, it should be those three games. Take the full loot adrenaline based gameplay from Rust, use the moment to moment gameplay from league (isometric, 6 ability action combat w/ 2 consumables), and then take the economy aspect from EVE. Everything is player crafted and bought and sold on separate auction houses across the game world. Why separate? Why not OSRS Grand exchange style? Some continents/zones give only certain resources, and the cities near them give refining bonuses to mats found far away. This creates incentives to move around and find arbitrage opportunities. You can purely play economic PvP in this game if you want. Transporting goods is a very lucrative activity, and therefore ganking those goods is just as lucrative. The game is also a sandbox, so players more or less make the content for themselves. If you log on every day expecting organized groups for ganking/roaming/gathering/PvE in your guild, it might not work out so well. Try being a leader and being the change you want to see if no one is running a group. It won't be easy, you might get your friends killed a couple times, but you gotta learn somehow. Everyone starts at the bottom, and the only thing separating the good players from the bad are the ones who stick through the rough stuff and keep working at it.

Let me address some common complaints:

""The weapons are unbalanced!"": Well, if you're considering the same activity, then yes. But there is large scale PvP/PvE in Albion and there is small scale. There is catching/ganking, there is escaping those people. There is gathering, there is solo play. Most weapons and armor are only good at one or two of those things, so what you end up with is a different sort of meta based on your group size. There's enough variation and frequent balance passes to address absolutely useless items as well, which results in these metas shifting sometimes. 

""I can't gather past ""x"" tier, people keep gang fucking me!"": Join a guild, go ganking with them, see how it's done. Then you'll know how to avoid it. There are plenty of gatherers that go without being killed gathering for months at a time. Personally, I've never been ganked while gathering T8 hides. I don't do it too often to be fair, but when I do I make sure I'm wearing proper escape gear and that I'm farming near safe territories. 

""The game is pay to win!"": There are two types of currency in Albion. Silver and Gold. Silver is used for pretty much everything, and you can buy gold with it on the in-game gold market. Gold is used to buy premium (gives more fame/exp, passive crafting points, etc.) as well as cosmetics, of which you can disable in the PvP zones if you want. Personally I've always been able to pay my monthly premium with silver, and I've been playing since steam release. On the note of people paying for gear with IRL money, In reality, the people who swipe their credit cards for gucci gear are way too afraid to leave the safe zones  (almost negligible fame, you will never progress here). When they do, people see that they're juiced and pile on like a bunch of coked out hyenas. It's an amazing system. If you try to P2W in this game, I can almost guarantee you'll end up making someone else rich. You need mechanical skill and experience to truly be successful in PvP, gear quality only helps up to a point.   

Lastly a word on the devs. These guys are seriously committed, and they've shown it time and time again, with the icing on the cake being this most recent update. There's too much for me to put into this review, but know this: they aren't going to give up on this game anytime soon, and it's slowly becoming more populated. This is nothing short of a marvel for MMOs today. Most start strong and fade quickly, but not here. I have great faith in this game and the developers, and they have some great content coming down the pipe for the next update. 

Obligatory shout out to one of the chillest big tent black zone guilds- Conflict! Join today, and I'll personally take some time and answer questions for you that you may have. Alternatively, if we're full, send me a whisper in game @BeeRye. I'd be happy to give you a hand.

But not what to gather and how to play the market, Pvp, what ( [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WP7VofvZwY] Red zones, Yellow zones, Blue zones [/url] ) are. This game has soo many things to offer that players usually get lost doing one thing (usually the thing they get introduced with at first) that they quit the game early on, since they don't know what to do. Trust me, the game has a TON to offer. you just gotta explore everything, And I don't recommend exploring the game by yourself. I highly recommend you find beginners guides on youtube or join a discord and ask people around what to do. And you will get amazed on how much there is to do in this game.

For beginners id recommend: Search up a guide on how the ( [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OAhVGc2Z-4] Skill tree [/url] ) works, and some guides on [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-aJPyfmscQ] how to make silver [/url] .

I recommend this game for people that are not scared of being overwhelmed of the things you can do and people that loves to explore games and find new things. Secondly this game is Fully player economy driven! Which means that you cant buy anything from NPC you can only craft them, and everything you use has been once gathered by a player then sold to another player that crafted it to a weapon which got later bought by you. I find this extremely exhilarating to think about each time i get a new weapon. It feels like this game's developers are the players. They decide the economy of everything.

Groups of people i recommend this for: People that like RPG games, Farming games, Building games, time killer games. This game has a very wide player base since the farmers can craft high quality food for the pvp players, and the gatherers can gather resources for crafters. Like this game is about players helping each other.

i give this game overall a 7.5/10. It gets really frustrating if you don't know much about the game and get killed in the red zone which makes you lose your whole inventory.",1579136451,1579136451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me put aside your worries and doubts. 

[h1]PREMIUM:[/h1] The premium subscription IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPETE IN PVP AND DOES NOT BAR YOU FROM ANY ACTIVITIES IN THE GAME. If you still wish to subscribe, it provides small XP boosters and things of that nature to make it just a little easier. A subscription can be earned through the in-game currency and if you join a guild they can easily buy your first month for you.

[h1]GEAR, GRIND, AND SKILL BASED COMBAT:[/h1] I was initially worried that the game would feature only gear based combat systems with a long grind to get there but with it being a sandbox game, you do not NEED to grind, leveling up certain weapons increases their power in your hands, but more expensive gear can do just the same, as items can only get so strong. This means that you can have a cheap weapon that you can swing just as hard as someone else who just picked up the more expensive version of that weapon. If you were to hold the expensive version, its power would increase, but it can only increase so much as there is a soft-cap. With the soft-cap in place it is possible to kill players with objectively better gear then you, using skill and counter play. There are tons of videos online of people winning outnumbered fights in this game (1v3 5v8 Ect.) and that really shines and sets this game apart.

[h1]FULL LOOT PVP:[/h1] You do not need to participate in Full loot PVP. There are blues zones and yellow zones that do not allow people to loot your body. When you feel you are ready, you can venture out to red zones where players can become hostile and attack you, but they quickly become outnumbered by the other friendly players that you can run to for help. 
As for the black zones, every player is marked hostile and it is every man for himself. The Red and the Black zones hold better loot and greater challenges for those who choose to find them.

[h1]CUSTOMIZATION:[/h1]  When you make your character there is customization that you can change at any time once your character is created, the only things you cannot change at the moment are gender and your character's name, which is what everyone sees. In Albion there are a large variety of weapons and armors that give your character different abilities. The weapon you choose gives you 3 abilities, while each piece of armor gives you 1 ability. These abilities and passives and be mixed and matched to create your own unique character.

[h1]SOLO CONTENT VS GROUP CONTENT[/h1] There are plenty of things to do as a solo player to make money, you can buy your own island, farm the crops and raise the animals. You can gather and craft all types of resources for making weapons and armor, there are dungeons specifically made for solo players to be able to level as fast as large groups.
large groups will get into group fights and split the loot up between them for a big payday, Groups can do Hellgates, and Castle sieges and Dungeon dives. 

I am always looking for the perfect MMO that is worth my time, one with skill based PVP with progression that is rewarding to play, fun to play with friends, and easy to hop in and out of. The game's art style is so inclusive that I see all age groups enjoying the game on all platforms including Mobile. (Yes, the game has a mobile client, and Yes, it works.)

Now that the game is free, why not give it a shot? Its only a 1.5 Gb download and I know your computer can run it.",1551861921,1578371505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Best advice for anyone starting out is, stick to a few things to focus on. You like Swords level those first, pick one set of armor or mix and match but stick to it. Gathering can be boring and put you at risk but easy way to make money. Focus again on one gathering set.

Well it's simple, they say SOLO is dead, even though, there is ton of solo activities, what these players really want to tell you is that you can't get top tier loot without being a part of a group - and that is very true. It's intended that the best of the best guilds get the best loot. It's quite simple to overcome this problem - join one of the guilds. Most if not all guilds in the game will accept new players and help them become better.

If you are thinking of playing this game, the only thing I can tell you is that - it's a game, don't get butthurt if you die. However if you are scared of PvP, this game is not for you. Everything in this game is designed in one way or the other towards helping or participating in PvP. You can be the guy on the sides who does not PvP, but you won't get the full experience of the game.

The game is full loot which means if you die, you lose everything. So make sure you never take out what you can't afford to lose.

Most of these negative reviews jump into this game thinking they deserve everything to be their way. It's a sandbox game, anything can happen. Devs are not overselling anything, what you see is what you get. So far I have not seen a single game breaking bug, nor have I been affected in any way by small bugs. Game runs great, the only issue I would say is the ping, but the devs are doing their best to improve it. 
If you like sandbox games (like EVE Online), give this game a go - it's pretty darn good!

I wanted to badly recommend this game, unfortunately I am pretty much a solo player and if you are solo and don't like to grind this game is simply not for you. I played almost 50 hours and although it can be very interesting, I think the core of this game is in its PVP framework. I would give it more of a pass, if it had a bit more PVE content, other than just crafting, farming, cooking, etc. 

Although I don't mind grinding, the game can't just be grinding in itself - so the game splits itself into two sections grinding, and PVP -- other than that, you have very little to go on.

The game does have competent graphics, sound, music -- but it has zero story, but given that it is a Sandbox, I can sort of understand this. But if you are looking into a more heavy RPG experience this does not have it.

So here is my rating breakdown:
- If you enjoy PVP -> RECOMMEND.
- If you enjoy grinding (without story elements) -> RECOMMEND
- if you do not enjoy PVP -> NOT RECOMMENDED
- If you do not enjoy grinding -> NOT RECOMMEND
- OVERALL RATING: NEUTRAL

Because my overall rating is NEUTRAL, I am unfortunately using the NOT RECOMMENDED option for Steam.

There is some value here, I just wish there was a bit more PVE content, if it had it this game would greatly benefit from this.",1533998379,1576179173,False,4,0,0.466339856386184692,0,True,False,False

Of course, you might have to grind a lot to achieve something in the game, but I like these kind of games personally. If you don't like it, you should stay away from this game.

Those groups are only active in the end game zones, where PvP is enabled. So befor you enter those zones for gathering, put your stuff into your bank.

* Discrimination of solo player. This game is made only for group activitity. Lone wolfs aren't welcome here, game feels unrewarding compared to how much u obtain by doing group activity.

Short Synopses

This is a visceral adventure game where you mostly travel with other players to fight other players. The game is fixed to hard so if you didn't enjoy games like the Dark Souls series or Zelda: Breath of the Wild you probably won't like this game since it's difficult.

Things to Do

In this game you can gather resources, refine them, and sell them to players for profit. Or you can find gatherers, kill them, and take everything they have when they die. You can choose to play as a mage, warrior, healer, archer and plus a lot of other classes. You can join an alliance and serve as a soldier in fight an epic fight for supremacy of the cities and lands of Ablion. Adventure alone or travel with a team to slay monsters to protect yourself from bandits. Explore vast cities with their own biomes and economies. Plus more.

Nature in All Its Chaos

In this game there's no elo match making to protect you from entering a region with very skilled players. No report system for verbally hostile people. No population control so you might have to fight 5 swordsmen at once. No mechanism to reduce your opponent's metal armor power versus your thin leather armor. If you want the protections most games provide for its players you have to join a guild or community with rules that allot the protections to its players that you want.

The devs's behavior contributes to the buildup of economic chaos (unforeseen patch and expansion consequences).

My personal subjective opinion is that Albion does not provide anything new in terms of ideas. The game relies on the same old fabricated and deliberate restrictions to keep the wheel turning (mass war, gating, bottlenecking). It's a sound base... but this isn't the only way.

Pros: Not many. Back at launch and before the servers took a crap it was cool. 
Graphics are creatively simple
Interesting concept with having the gear be your lvl instead of normal RPG lvling system

Cons: Grind fest
Broken servers
Went ftp without really letting people know until the last few moments which pissed a lot of people off
PvP and guilds could be better (took me forever to get into a guild)
Free for all looting is bullsh*t
They use the pay to play with a lot of things even after the game went free
Poor community of people 
Found a few bots 
Lag is terrible

All around a game I wouldn't spend time with unless you want broken servers and ptp. It's sad. A game with so much potential and an interesting concept went down the drain so fast.

Be very careful if you do decide to play this game, there are many problems that accompany it. The largest being the Customer Care Agents. I really did enjoy playing this game it is a shame that I now must post negatively about it. I have done nothing but try to grow this game and make it a fun place for new players. I have made excuse after excuse for the problems it does have and reassured people that the devs work diligently to fix issues, bugs and other problems users may experience. It's just too bad that the customer care agents are not on the same page with the players and the Devs in making Albion a GREAT GAME, if they ever do join our side I really to believe Albion Online could be one of the BEST mmorpgs.
To fill everyone in as to why I feel betrayed by Albion customer care and why I truly believe that they are working against all the hard work the DEVS have put in. It started one day when my group asked me to run some Fame farms with them, being a healer as I'am makes my services highly sought after and being the great guild member that I'am I immediately log in to Albion Online and head off to my island to gear or so I thought! This was the beginning to all the tragic endeavors I was soon to face. As I clicked the travel to island opinion the game was stuck by one of its massive lag spikes that we know all to well, by the time my lag had settled there was something new in the island merchants opinion menu when I opened it back up, something I had planned never to see, It was a red message saying your island has already been moved? I was shocked my island was created in Lymhurst and never did I have the intention of moving it but alas it had been done! Yes moved to Murtlock of all places and without my permission or my intentions. Dismayed and having no idea what to do I asked my guild how reposed to this travesty, they recommended I open a support ticket and assured me of the helpfulness of the Albion support team, joyed by this wonderful news I started the process of opening a ticket.
TICKET NUMBER: 125506

My island somehow got moved to murlock I don't want it in murtlock I want my island in Lymhurst I don't understand how or why it got moved to murtlock please help move my island back to lymhurst I've put lots of silver into my island and it does no good in murlock again please move my island back to lymhurst thank you and sorry to waste your time

Would you please share with us the old and new location of your island?Looking forward to hearing from you!Cordially,Samantha | Customer Care Agent | support@albiononline.comAlbion Online - Craft.

Which seems like a odd response seeing how all the information she just asked for was in my original ticket almost like it wasn't even read? Regardless her response gave me hope. I mean come on would that not have giving you all hope?
""I would love to help you but I need you to provide additional details so we can help""
My hope unfortunately was very misguided indeed! The next response I received was very unexpected. I replied back with all the information I had giving the 1st time. Thinking that it was going to be just a moment before all my problems were solved instead this is the reply I received
NOTE THE TIME FRAME

Hi there,
Thanks for reaching out to us and I hope you're doing well today.
I'm afraid we will not be able to move your island for you. This is only a one-time option where you can move your island to any city you would like. You may wish to consider the option to access your island from your Island Merchant.
Additionally, the game does provide a warning prior to moving your island that you can not reverse your choice. Once the location is selected where you would like your island to be, it cannot be undone.
I'm sorry we could not help with your request.
Cordially,
Samantha | Customer Care Agent | support@albiononline.com

It seems unfair to me that this has happened and I am guessing I'am not the only person with an island in Murtlock! So please speak up and lets fight this injustice and just maybe we can help them to see the errors of there ways and in turn keep this kind of tragedy from happening to the new player base.

Albion stays true to the Sandbox term by having a completely player run economy, the freedom to choose your own path without class restrictions, and a deep and addicting progression system that progresses as you perform actions, rather than levels.  

The game has changed a lot since the beta days but with the recent patch on March 20th 2019 called Oberon, the game implemented one of the best features yet in the ""Random Dungeons"".  This, coupled with the Free to Play launch, have made Albion alive and well again.  I highly recommend this game and don't get discouraged when you die for the first time.

Description - -

This is a free to play PvP PvE game with an mmorpg mix with a moba style controls. It has crafting, fishing, farming (when you buy your housing island) animal breeding too. It also has pvp combat, and PvE dungeons.

There is guild versus guild combat, dueling, arena, world pvp, ganking, and different types of dungeons of various levels of difficulty. 

The reason there is so many bad reviews is because people have trouble logging when there is a 3000 que to wait in line. Between europe and american evening it does get crowded.

As for player and skills themselves, - you can go different kinds of weapons and armor builds, and you level them up with fame(experience points) and each weapon has a unique set of skills that gets even more specialized into sub classes.

You can go tank healer dps, or any combination of assassin, melee, range, siege, caster, healer, support. You can also mix plate with caster staffs, or use swords and axes as a caster.

There is premium which is a subscription to the game. You do have to farm grind and level your skills (crafting farming weapon armor breeding fishing harvesting refining are all skills) so premium does give you a little boost.

But it's free to play, and if you watch lewpac's f2p cheap builds, you can be very competitive and strong.

Premium is not pay to win, but pay to progress faster. You can buy premium with in game silver, or real life money.

The PvP has a thing where - if you die in a red or black combat zone, you lose all your items on your character. It sounds scary at first, but gear is so cheap to buy, and if you're in a guild they will provide you with free gear. Also you can take other people's gear and sell it or use it your self.

You don't have to play in a pvp combat zone. Yellow and blue zones are perfect fine and you can harvest goods from these zones and do dungeons in these zones for lots of free experience and loot.

Overall this is a really fun game, it's just that now that's free to play - people are bottlenecking the login servers to get in and level up their characters.

Give us proper PvE content, for solos and for groups. Give us raids and something to work towards that doesn't always have PvP as the end goal. Expand the game loop into something more than just ganking or running away from gankers. I like ganking just fine, but again, it gets repetitive.

The recent faction wars update didn't add more PvE content, it just added more reasons and ways to gank.

Since it's going free to play today, I decided to write a review of the game since it deserves more positive reviews.  Albion Online offers what few MMO's do today, a sandbox world with a risk vs reward type of adventuring.  The game has changed so much since the early days of beta, and it has only gotten better.

Positives:

True Sandbox Gameplay - You aren't pigeon holed into boring, meaningless quests from NPC's you don't care or knon nothing about.  In Albion Online you decide what you want to do.  Going back to the days of games such as Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies, Albion offers some of the best sandbox gameplay you can get out of the game.

Skill Based Progression - Unlike games such as WoW, you don't just gain mindless experience and levels.  You have a gigantic skill tree system called the Destiny Board.  It can be overwhelming at first because of the sheer size of it, but once you break it down it's very easy to understand how it works.  You pick the weapon for instance, and use it which skills up trees related to it on the Destiny Board.

Player Driven Economy - This is probably my favourite feature of Albion Online.   This game has an entire player driven economy.  There are 6 main cities in the game each with their own marketplace.  Some resources aren't available in certain areas so supply and demand come into effect here.  If you like crafting, or playing the Auction House in other games, you'll love this feature.

Random Dungeons - A brand new feature recently added which has changed the game for the better.  Albion Online being a sandbox skill based game has what they all do, a massive grind.  However, with the addition of these random dungeons, the fame (xp) you get in them is incredible so it makes the grind a lot less like a grind.  Plus there is always people asking for groups into random dungeons, so it's a great way for a solo player to go out and be more social.  Btw solo random dungeons are also coming soon if you aren't into that!

Full Loot PvP (In Red / Black Zones) Some will not like this, and I completely understand.  Losing all of your items can be very frustrating and this world can be a harsh one if you are alone.  HOWEVER, you aren't forced into the red / black zones unless you want the best resources.  This is the risk vs reward type of gameplay which I love about Albion.  If you would rather be more casual and hang out in blue / yellow zones you still can do that and even pvp in yellow zones without ever losing your items.  The choice is up to you.

One Massive World - There are no shards or other servers in Albion Online.  Like EVE, the game is one giant world with everyone playing concurrently.  This makes the game come alive, you'll forge friendships and also enemies with people on this server, so player reputation can come into play here.  

Customization  - You are what you wear in Albion.  Want to be a traditional heavy armor tank?  You can do that.  Want to be a battle mage that wears plate armor?  You can also do that, the choice is up to you.  Obviously there are certain builds that excel in different types of gameplay, but you aren't forced into doing anything you don't want to.  There are 3 armor types and tons of weapons.  In each of these, there are sub categories and more powerful weapons / armor called Artifacts.  

Crafting - Unlike most MMO's, crafting in this game is needed since everything is made by players in the game.  The system itself isn't as advanced as something like Star Wars Galaxies.  However, all items are useful in this game.  Even Tier 1 carrots in farming are needed for animals to consume.  

Farming - Do you like Farmville or do you like making tons of money?  Try farming on your own private island.  You can grow crops such as carrots and corn, plants for potions or even breed animals for food or different mounts.  I love the farming system in this game, I grow crops daily which I use to craft consumbles.

Gathering - Gathering in this game is probably the best in any MMO.  There are 6 resources: Ore, Stone, Wood, Hide, Fiber, and Fish.  Low tiers of resources are always needed since they are required to refine higher tier resources.  This makes it so ever resource always has a use.  Fishing was added post launch and is used to enhance food buffs.

Player vs Player - A big reason why I bought this game originally was the player vs player system.  There are multiple ways you can pvp in Albion Online.  Join one of the 5 factions and enjoy full loot anywhere on the map against opposing faction members.  Try out PvP by battling in an instanced arena, or you could flag up in a yellow zone and gank other players (can't loot them though).  If you're feeling very bold, you can venture out into the red and black zones on the Outland continent.  There is also guild vs guild pvp and zerg vs zerg massive open world pvp.

Community - In sandbox games, one of the best features is actually the players who inhabit the game world.  Same can be said in this game.  There is no dungeon finder, there is a looking for group tool, but this game requires more social interaction then typical MMOs.  I will always say this is a good thing.  The solo WoW era killed a lot of the magic that made MMOs special, so I'm glad to see a game with a community such as this.  You can still play this game solo if you want though, you aren't forced into doing anything you don't want to.

Negatives:

Vanity Items / Avatar Customization - There isn't a lot of choice when making your basic avatar at the start.  Very little selection of things such as beards and hairstyles and character portraits.  There is also no transmog feature in the game so you can't further customize your armor.  However, this will soon be fixed in a later patch (Albion Roadmap).  They are adding in a Wardrobe feature and more avatar customization.

Graphics - I personally don't think these are an issue, but I put it here because I know some will find this a turn off.  Albion Online uses an isometric perspective like Diablo does.  The graphics aren't top notch because this game is cross platform with mobile devices so the art style is probably like the way it is because of this.  The graphics are cartoony and stylized, so if you don't like this, you will not like the look of the game.

Controls - Probably the weakest part of the game is the controls.  You can't use WASD to move around the game world.  Everything is done with the mouse much like how Diablo controls.  You can set up hotkeys, but you can't customize your mouse keys at all.  I find the controls clunky, but I accept them for what they are.  I hope mouse binds are added, and another type of movement mode I'll just call Traditional MMO (WASD).  The controls will take a bit to get used to if you aren't used to this type of system.

Server Lag - Not always an issue of course, but when the server lags, it really does.  With Free to Play the lag got to be pretty annoying with a lot of rubberbanding going on.  In a full loot pvp game, getting lagged out and dying only to lose all your items can be extremely frustrating.  I know Sandbox Interactive has done a great job trying to optimize the game when it comes to this, but it still needs more improvement.

Not very solo friendly (it is improving though) - Solo players will have a harder experience in Albion Online.  You can of course solo all you want, but to get the best Albion Online experience you will need to join a player guild or group.  If you want to be a lone wolf ganker though, this game allows it and you can excel at that.  Want to do a random dungeon solo?  You can try, but you'll most likely die.  However, solo random dungeons ARE coming soon, so even solo players are getting love in this game.

This game gets alot of mixed reviews and to me thats fair. I for one like this game alot, and here is why:

Unique: The mechanics in this mmo differ from others in a good way. The fact that you can get some resources ""cash back"" when crafting in bulk, able to make public crafting stations in cities, and the way carry weight is managed via mounts just to name a few.

Grind: This is where alot of people love or hate the game and its fair because this game is GRIND HEAVY. What i like about it is, all tier resources stay relevant. That makes everything you pick up worth something no matter what. The fame and daily reward points are fair for each tier and the harvest time vs skill is balanced. World resources respawn rather quickly so there is always something to gather for everyone. There is always something to do, ALWAYS.

Economy: Its all player driven, so that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. For the most part you just adapt to prices as they fluctuate. I havent had any issues making a buck and neither should you. The fact regions offer more than others on diffrent resources makes it interesting and opens doors to make money.

Combat: Its simple but still requires skill and being equipped for the right situation. You have cloth (highest attack, lowest defense), leather (middle ground), and Plate (tank). Each sets have unique skills, and you can pick/swap at will. EX: plate chest piece has three skills, you pick one that suits your playstyle but can swap to the other two anytime. Each type (cloth, leather, plate) has three sets within the line (light, med, heavy) that differ slightly. Plus many weapon types and trees to play with. This gives you options but isnt overwhelming.

What i dont like however:

Combat: I know right, just got done saying i like it.. What i dont like is that its rather clunky feeling. You move via point and click, or hold the mouse to move in a direction and use Q,W,E for weapon skills, and R,D for armor skills, and F for movement skill. Its not terrible but when fighting it becomes a pain to move out of danger and pick targets. Alot of the time i find im not auto attacking and just sitting there even when i hit SPACE (auto attack recent target). Or when i move out of an attack zone and hit space to resume attacking, my dude wants to keep moving away. Fighting groups (pvp/pve) can be a total nightmare sometimes.

Grind: wait....wait.. yes, im doing that thing. So the grind is heavy AF as stated. This gives you lots to do but can make it feel hopeless as you gaze upon the next rank requirements for gear/gathering. Some parts of the tree and pretty quick, but others not so much. To get anywhere in a decent amount of time you have to commit to something and dabble in the rest.

EX: you like wood, yes i know you do.. so you chop trees because who need oxygen right? As you chop, you get fame, then your first lvl. Congrats! You can use a green ax now. chop chop later, you finally lvl again, alright blue now, sweet. chop chop some more, another lvl, woo hoo, now you can wield red so on and so forth.

 This is all well and good but the time it takes to get through tier to tier is a ****ing lot. The only way to speed it up is by using LP (learning points). 

LP is hard to come by, as in you dont come by it at all. you dont earn it by doing something, you get it each day. 10 if your premium. They can be used when you reach a threshold in the skill you are leveling. Its like 20% i think. After T3 (green) it slows down but doesnt require alot of LP. After T4(blue) its 100 somthing LP to get to red after you slave away to get to the 20% mark. Thats where the cries for Grindy as hell come from.

All trees are like this, except a few, but the important ones are. This can make things feel great when you finally get to that tier but getting there feels awful. I bought the game and got 350LP. starting out that seemed like alot (such..a...noooooob) I spent some here, and there, and now i only have 90 something left. My next unlock costs 117LP and its taking forever to get there. thats just to 20% And thats just ONE of the many many trees.

So when i say pick ONE thing to be good at, Please...just do it. 

So now that i totally lost track of how i was gonna write this thing ill just explain the thing rookies fear when they start, and what you have no doubt read what others are complaining about. 

LOSING. YO. STUUFFFF.

So when i started i was weary of everyone, even in blue zones (safe zones) thinking me and my donkey were gonna have a bad day at any second. Later i realized Red and the dreaded Black zones are where you should be weary. Even then its not that bad.

In blue, nothing can happen to you aside from getting a boo boo from mobs.

In yellow (which you will spend most of your time grinding your face off) The only way someone can hurt you (aside from words) is flagging themselves as hostile. When you enter yellow you will see at the bottom how many people decided they want to take their day out on others. If you wind up running into one of these people, and they do mean things to you, you wont/cant die. You just fall down for a bit and get up. Not so bad. (you gear does degrade a bit though).

in red zones, the same thing above applies except when you die, you is ded son. All your gear R BELONG TO THEM NOW. Your horse, clothes, all that crap you were holding onto, all theirs... except  gold or silver, they never get, so theres that at least. Oh and mobs can kill kill you too.

in watch your back black zones, there is none of that crap above except the getting murdered and losing your stuff. There is no flagging up, no hey look at me im a bad guy, its anyone and everyone is fair game. You thought she loved you for who you are? No bro, she just wanted your stuff.. thats why the first date was in a black zone..

I know i seem to be harping on this game even though i rate it up, and i really really like this game, But i know its not for everyone. The people need to know things, and ill share my take on it. I paid for this, KNOWING its going F2P. I dont regret it at all, infact i would buy the legendary pack but its off sale now and im not dropping 70 bucks atm. 

TL;DR

But you reading this, are most likely getting on board for free. If thats the case, just try it. Chop some stuff, stab some things, ask questions. Feel it out for yourself. For free you have NOTHING to lose, except for your virtual stuff. Its just stuff though. Its a well done and unique game that will give you lots to do until you are over it or until you win. You owe it to yourself... you owe it to your family.",1554292265,1554462957,True,106,40,0.802395284175872803,0,True,False,False

($20 is a really good price imo. You'll get a mount (Specteral Wolf), some gold, and another thing (forgot) when this becomes free 2 play.

[Long review because I see many negative reviews that baffle me, will put 3 sections for this game. Informative, Good, and Bad.] 

============================[Informative]=================================

First of all, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take the time to research this game before paying $30 for it. There is a lot of grinding. (Although, they're making it easier with the monthly challenges that give you so many tomes of insight [free xp basically]) This game has a unique artstyle. Its not going to have Black Desert graphics nor can you change the camera. As I see a lot of people care about graphics like that matters more than gameplay. I enjoy the graphics, and they work on subpar gaming rigs / even my school laptop (with around 20ms, playable) you can get this game on your tablet if you manage to get one of the keys to them. (I am still trying)

You can also get a trial key to try out the game up to T4 I believe. Which again, baffles me that people try out the game for >1 hour and complain they don't like it. Don't spend $30 on a game you don't know about!

Gear scales downwards depending on the zone. Arena is also scaled gear down to make it more balanced! So you cannot just wipe the floor in T8 gear while the enemy is in T4. Gear doesnt scale down in black zones where you'll most likely be when you're this far anyways.
pls play arena guys, 40min queue times kill me late at night ;-;

The game is not dead either, don't just follow the steamcharts since there are a lot of people playing on the albion launcher.

==============================[The Good]================================
The good, or what keeps me playing.

+ JOIN AN ACTIVE GUILD IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I can't stress this enough, i was about to quit @ 100hours in because the first guild I was in didn't do anything! Now I'm doing ZvZ's, mages, dungeons, etc! Which then also speaks about the community. 

I like the community. I don't see how people say this community is toxic unless you havent played Overwatch / League or you don't talk at all in video games. Nothing new, and its more laid back than other games. Just saying mods are pretty cool and let a lot of things slide in the game. The only time is late in the morning (3AM) when no one talks / other languages than english start talking.

+The grind isnt bad if you know what you're doing. I have alliance members who average 525k fame an hour in dungeons. It helps if you're into a guild and they'll power level you really quickly in higher tier dungeons. Again, join a good guild / alliance and get involved!

+ZvZ's, GvG's, HCE's, Mages, Hellgates, and even Gathering. It all starts to get addicting once you start doing them. Most are pvp, but gathering is like your Runescape woodcutting / mining. Click and watch. Which could be a good or bad thing.

+Classless PVP is the best MMO imo. I hate being locked onto a tank character and then making a new character just to heal. You can really make your own build if you want. (Tank with daggers sure why the fuck not)

==============================[The Bad]=================================
Thirdly, i want to talk about the ""controversial"" or ""what people like to ""complain"" or give reasons to hate this game 

-Premium. Its something everyone complains about. It helps you gather more (Premium Bonus) and gives you Learning Points. Learning Points let you automatically level a skill up once you hit 20% on that level. Its really worth it, and you can pay for it with in game silver too. (Although, we all agree that just spending $10 for an entire month is better since its just 1 hour of work)

-This game is PAY2PROGRESS, I find this different than Pay 2 Win (P2W). I want to explain. I always think P2W was always about locking people out of good weapons / items until they paid for the item. While pay 2 progress is more like anyone can earn the items in game, but you can buy your xp to use the weapons. This may sound like an advantage, but you're not gonna get far in the pvp zones unless you are with a guild anyways since everyone ganks anymore. Which leads to my next issue with the game.

Note:
            I WANT TO SAY THE PAY 2 PROGRESS AND PREMIUM IS NOT AS BAD AS YOU'RE THINKING AND I REALLY DONT SEE PEOPLE PAYING $100+ GOLD TO JUST LEVEL UP 

- Rarely does anyone solo pvp in full loot. The only time I've been killed by one person alone was when we were both in fishing gear fighting for a lake with bloodletters. You will see gankers and they are common! IF not, expect to be ganked :)

- There isnt a story, which isnt a problem for me as I value the gameplay more but I know others do care. There aren't any quests beside the tutorial to get yourself a Tier 2 donkey.

- My main gripe, not enough solo content. I can't really explain nor give any ideas. But when all my guild members log off. I would still like to do more of the bigger dungeons. The ""solo"" dungeons really arent good fame nor good money. You can go invis and go straight to the boss, its more efficient just killing roaming T8 mobs. 


I'll keep comments enabled, I want to see if others agree / disagree. I personally enjoy this game and did get my money's worth. I'll clean up the review and make it neater in the future.
============================Oberon Update==============================

THEY MADE EARLIER TIER (GATHERING / GEAR) EVEN EASIER

Random dungeons - These are actually awesome and a lot of fun.

Lower tier mobs will give more fame (easier to level gear!) I leveld my spear from lvl 6 -> 23 in like 30 minutes - to an hour. Its insane.

New players rejoice!

The random dungeons are a breathe of fresh air, and you better be ready for people to dive in. Its good fame and good money.

This game is defiantly not intended for solo players. It will eventually force you to join a guild of some sort. The largest issue I can see with this game is the trolling or ganking in the game. It’s a if you can’t beat them join them type scenario. You must spend a lot of time working on getting your character to high tiers (Max 8) in order to be competitive with others.

Tiers
So, the game does not level your person but rather your weapons, shields, clothing/armor, tools and so on. The max tier for each item is 8 (T8). Because of this it makes it VERY difficult to get yourself up to a high enough tier in a timely manor when you have veteran players. I have a little over 200 hours of play time and nearly all that was strictly gathering stone which I have yet to be tier 8.

Grind
For those that like pretty much never-ending grinding this is the game for you. As I stated above the 200 plus hours, I have played were dedicated to gathering stone. I have yet to get to T8 as the T7 and T8 stone you must gather to level faster is in what’s called a Black zone. Those zones will be covered more below. Due to the gathering gear you need to wear to expedite the leveling process you cannot quickly escape combat or have a fair fight. Each of the major zones are occupied by very large guilds that will kill anyone on site. Now this is also true for random players that stroll through. So, you have to watch for not just guilds but randoms as well.

Zones
The game has 4 zones (Blue, Yellow, Red and Black). Each have a very important play style and information behind them.

Blue = PVE zones but all low-level tier items. To level yourself past T3 or even T4 you may need to move the next zone.
Yellow = PVP zone but instead of loosing all your items you lose a random item and some currency. The resources do go a little higher here around a T5 range.
Red = PVP zone however you die everything is lost unless your killed by an NPC and no one finds your body. Resources here also get an increase but very dangerous to go gathering. Recommended to stay with a group.
Black = PVP zone as well but with max tier resources and scarcer. It is also a very difficult zone to be in and strongly recommended to be with a guild or at least a group while being there.

Ganking
For those that are not familiar with this term it is simply just players ganging up on players to kill them in game. Now this is common to happen in this game as individuals will have a spotter watching for players to go by then the others will cloak just before your screen can see. Because of this they will stun you and lock you down then kill you to take your stuff. This happens all the time for individuals returning to cities, so they get your gathered items. If you see someone fishing near a city underway entrance good chance they are scouting. This is also true for transitions from Yellow to Red zones or Red to Red zones. Due to you being stuck between two red zones you become a high-profile target as you cannot escape nearly as easy. Typically, there is another set of players waiting on the other side for you.

Cities
Most cities are controlled by a large guild or rather wealthy player. Because of this they really control the economy in the game. This can make your life difficult as you will need to utilize the player owned crafting stations. You can build your own on your island, but it takes a lot of resources to get them max tier.

Monthly Cost
The company just dropped they are making the game “Free to play” well this is actually not true. They do have a monthly pay to play structure just half a$$ed. You can still play (Kinda) but you cannot purchase an Island, create a guild and few other perks. Your XP gained is reduced and the amount of your daily crop/animal thing is reduced and will not generate while offline. TRUST ME YOU NEED IT! So, I would not say the game is free by any means and not worth the monthly cost with all the headaches you will have.

Guild Tax
The larger guilds and the ones that have the most territories are who you want to be with. However, you will pay a tax which means each kill you get, you get taxed. You may even be required to turn over a percentage of resources gathered. You are also limited in what areas you can gather in. So, these are a double-edged sword as they help you prevent you from dying so quickly but you have the BS that comes with it.

Overall Rating
Well I give the game a bad review as it was not well thought out. The PVP aspect of this game is odd and can just be very unbalanced. They make updates to some weapons that literally destroy the one you mastered in making another one you have not spend anytime leveling much better. They really need to find a decent balance of how the PVP side won’t be so cancer. It is a difficult balance to find but they need to find something to even it out. You literally must join the gankers to make it in this game. I am up for PVP no problem but when I have 200 hours in and cannot even get anywhere, I feel it was a large waste of my time. My wife and I have the same number of hours and at this point cannot stand to play the game.",1553412505,1553412505,False,421,44,0.761779427528381348,0,True,False,False

if you are going to purchase this game make sure you do some proper research alot of video will be completely outdated to my experience.
It is a constant grind you will spend about 30ish hours to get something to t5 harvesting.
the way to get really good exp is to zerg the absolute fek out of a red/black zone dungeon that way almost no one can contest you and you will bully 90% of the groups that come to do the dungeon, they are not separate instance like wow or other mmo you will have to compete for the dungeons if you cant beat them because they are far better geared then you join them.
about 90% of the pvp i was in way a group of gankers trying to kill gatherers that i then got my group and killed people PVG is boring and i cant get behind why people just want to be dicks but then again they have t8 gear and probably have nothing better to do.
the citys for the most part are player ran, this sounds awesome but it leads to some issues... monopolies places like Fort Sterling Thetford and Lymhurst are all ran by extremely rich people and the taxes are so high there you money will practically be flying out of you pockets and if you are new to the game you will think nothing of the taxes on the crafting stations, you will think its a standard.
Alot of the time you will be walking as the fast travel is very expensive and going into red zones to get there faster might be tempting but gankers are always lurking, so if you walk into a red zone do not fret if you lose all your gear ALL-LOOT means you drop everything on death nothing is sacred however stuff has a 5-10% chance to turn into a useless item called trash.

so i think thats my rant.

But for those thinking this may be worth a shot, get it in a sale. Its not the most expensive game anyway but its certainly not worth the price listed. The grind is real even early doors (though this is apparently changing in the new patch, but I cannot see much overhaul as this would reduce/impact those who persevered and are through to the end game).

This game lacks severely from being able to teleport around and certainly doesn't capture what the early trailers said it would where each any every individual has a place and purpose. The server i was on one guild (may have been one person to be honest) owned everything in the towns and cities, so you couldnt put your own store up to generate income. Crafting whilst enjoyable to begin with, becomes a massive grind even for basic weapons. Collecting materials again takes ages and the lower level stuff has absolutely zero value so new starters be prepared to not be able to sell anything to earn any gold. I think when I first started Transport Oxes were going for around 4k on the market, by the time I got to actually raising them myself to sell they were worth about 500g, which just wasnt worth the effort, which then put me off going up the tiers because they became more diluted as well. 

The game is geared towards making you pay, the fame situation whilst a nice boost in the beginning fast becomes a crutch later into the game where you need it most. As it doesnt recoup all that quickly you can get the VIP treatment that gives you a boost every day along with other perks. Its not so much pay to win for items, but for progression. 

Like I said I only played about 50 hours and gave up, I've not fancied going back and even the new update doesnt really tempt me. Got most stuff to rank 4 and it was becoming a massive chore to reach level 5 tier anything, grind in these mmo games is good, but not this much. If they reduce it by about 50% then it might be quicker more dynamic and allow more people to venture to the end where the meat of the game appears to be but for now its just not worth it when there a plenty of other similar games that are better, cheaper or even free.",1552173872,1552173872,False,2,0,0.48205527663230896,0,True,False,False

One of the best MMOs i have played, i'd say its almost better that Current WoW.

-Combat
i really like the MOBA-like combat, and this is coming from someone who dislikes MOBAs in general.

-Progression
Can be very grindy at times, but its a fun grind.

-Dungeons/expeditions
the dungeons feel a lot like Diablo, except more linear.

-Difficulty
At times the combat can be pretty easy (move out of the attack, interrupt, etc.), but this game can kick your ass if you underestimate it.

-Conclusion
10/10
Buy this game, its worth every penny   

Whether your new to MMOs or a refugee from a dead or dying MMO (*cough* WoW *cough*), this game has something for you.

Therefore u don't even need to buy epic pack or legendary pack cuz when u die u will give to other fukin person. This game has fun who are ganking other person. making a fuking group and kill unknown person. U can't even think to play solo . U need a damn group to survive this stupid world. 
leveling system is really horrible really... its gets bored easily. cuz of u are getting less fame in blue zone and yellow zone and lack of dungeons and raids.

            So first and formost after finishing the tutorial and doing the first few quests my first thought was that this seemed...familar. I have played RuneScape, I have played WoW since BC (Stopped Recently), I have played ESO for hundreds of hours on my ps4, and I have played GW2 for an even longer time than ESO. And to my surprise it wsnt like any of those. This familiar feeling wasn't from an mmo. It was from Rust, Hurtworld, and so many open world, multiplayer, survival games that I have played before. People are attacking this game from the wrong angle. This isnt ""GUILD WARS MEETS RUNESCAPE!"" The closest I can think of is ""RuneScape/Guild Wars 2/RUST."" The perspective of RS, the PVP battles and similar gear systems (Kinda pushing it on the gear) and Rust's progression. Think about it. Just hide the NPCs, The quest markers, Skills and EXP. 

Now what is the first thing you do? 

You start off grabing some logs and some stones to get ur first tools.

Get some hide and some more materials to upgrade your weapons and armour.

What next?

Make some friends. Join a Guild.

Now what? ""I'm strong, what left is there to do?""

Well time to risk it all of course!

Time to enter the red and black zones. Time to grief or be griefed.

That's what this open world experiance is all about. I think the marketing team for this game is aiming at the wrong demographic here. Get the Rust, Ark, and Hurtworld guys on here. They'd go nuts. I would recomend this game to people. Not my old hardcore WoW buddies that would be on for more than 12 hours a day grinding out their gear to get that world first on patch day. Instead my other friends who love to hop on our more casual and/or hardcore Hurtworld and Ark servers and go challenge the biggest mother F***** in the server and ruin their day.

(Now at ~5+ hours)

I have progressed a decent amout and have began to get a build working. I have reached T4 for the majority of my gear but have decided that I want to mix up a few peices. To help understand my plight as a new player I am going to explain some of the exp/progression system in place; called, ""Fame."" Every action you make in the game will grant you this ""Fame."" Unlike most games this is not showed by a progression bar on screen but instead in a web like skill tree.  Everything that you can advance in this game requires that you repeat the action that you want to level up. Ex: ""Lets say that I want to begain to skin a T3 beast. While all of my Fame and gear is at T2. How would I go about this.

1: Find all Fame tiers and their prerequisites. These include the skill line that would let you equip AND craft a Journeyman's Skinning Knife (T3 knife). I would HIGHLY recommend not only learning how to equip the tool/weapon, but also how to craft it; since this game relies so heavly on the mechanic.

2: The next step will be to learn how to equip the knife. To gain this skill I must gain a certain amout of Fame through skinning animals of T2 or higher. This can be done very quickly if you find the right areas to farm it out quick.

3: Finally learn to craft the weapon. This is where it gets expensive. This is not just 'poof, I now have this; since I can equip the item.' You are going to need to craft T2 skinning knifes. Just T2 skinning knifes. This will grant you Fame towards crafting the T3 skinning knife. At first I was just crafting duplicate after duplicate and slowly lvling it up. However I soon found the study mechanic. This lets you study an item that you are required to craft in oder to get a huge boost of fame towards that skill tree. So that means instead of crafting 20 T2 skinning knifes then recycling them. I could instead craft 6-9 and study them all. Much quicker and much more efficent. Howerver this method requires silver and depending on the city you are in it can be quite expensive.

4: After all of this toil you have now lvled up to T3 in both using and crafting an item. Dope. However this is only one item. Now do this for every gear slot with 3 diferent weights (leather, Cloth, and Plate), every weapon type, and every tool. Oof.

Of course, focus on what build you want to do, in my case though I was going a leather build but I felt like I wsn't taking advantage of the no penataly of mix mathching gear weights. So i decided to read some of the other parts. I found the ""Mages Cowl"" which grants me a poison buff on one of my autos. However I had been progressing in leather helmets and the cowl was in cloth helmets. So I had to pretty much start over in that path. It was pretty quick cause I had all the materials already, but I found myself running dungeon after dungeon for the silver reward to study and craft everything.

Verdict at ~5+ hours: Still recomended.

(Note: I will update this review as I play. Gl hf all.)

(Now at ~50+ hours)

Okay so... I started to branch out into other skill trees and have reached T4 on all three armor types and a ton of different weapons. However this has seriously hinderd my ability to reach T5 on the armors I know I like. I also began to work the market with little T5 mats that I have collected and began to get my island started. I have made a ton of progression on my island and I started to make a lot of money off it. Unfortunalty this has led to me halting in my progression towards finishing my T5 gear sets. Due to my lacking of learning points to rush my tools to T4 and T5. But hey I'm making bank. I have also begun to do some open world pvp and all the encounters that I have had have been fair and fun. Though as a solo player this is likely to change in the future as I begin to encounter lager parties and zergs.

The positives? It's like Eve Online and Runescape had a lovechild and that's a fantastic idea.



The negatives? The love child came out with horrible birth defects. There are fairly steady disconnecting issues depending on where you are(crippling or a full loot pvp game) and this does not matter upon your PC specs. To add to that regardless of your pc specs or how low you set your graphics upon entering medium to large scale engagements there is immense lag caused by the servers inability to handle the load/inept coding towards allowing larger sized fights. The cherry on top is the ""support"" staff whom are fairly useless in many problems and police the game based on their own individual feelings rather than sticking to the rules. For example some mods will make rather edgy jokes about the nature of homosexuality while another mod will give you a 24 hour mute for even saying the word ""homosexual"" or ""gay"". You can't expect the GM team to help with ridiculous mod punishments either as they will stand with them regardless of the situation.


  To add to that I lost an alt account because I had sold items to a guy who had bought silver.

I play it off and on every now and then as I am a huge fan of runescape. I was looking for a game that could deliver that experience with some modern elements. Now, what i did not expect was a lack of creator made content. While other sandbox games are fairly open, after Albion's tutorial you are left to gather and sell resources. What drove me away from this system however was the ludicrous amount of money I had to make to Grind crafting. After a few hours of harvesting resources with friends the novelty wears off and I just go back to runescape. On a positive note the combat system is pretty good and the harvesting ""feels"" pretty satisfying, however brief. And the idea of gear and actual skill being the core of PvP instead of level is great too. If the creators would put in some effort to make a story and lower the revenue cost of crafting I'd definetly come back more often. I never refunded but still felt cheated in a way. This game left a confusingly sour taste in my mouth. I wanted to love it but in the end it still needs some help.

	[td][b][i]Graphics[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]6[/b] - Low(ish) polygon but perfectly serviceable. Since the game was made to run on tablets and PC's the graphics and graphical features represent this. I did find the environments to be rather generic, almost primitive in their design, but this is often hidden by good use of shadows and lighting.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Performance / Bug & Issues[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]6[/b] - While most PC users PC's won't struggle to run the game you will definitely encounter lag depending on how far away you are from the server. I had had constant noticeable lag every few seconds which subtracted from the enjoyment. In my time spent with the game I didn't run into any bugs that were game breaking or even noticeable.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Story[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]3[/b] - Listed as a sandbox MMO, this basically means the developer didn't bother adding any story content so you are left to your own devices to create your own stories. I am not a fan of this approach and if neither are you I would steer clear from this one. There are dungeons to explore, outside of the excruciating gathering and craft mechanics, but without any narrative to anchor me I quickly grew bored, not to mention each dungeon looks vaguely familiar to the one you completed previously.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Gameplay[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]3[/b] - Most of your time will be spend gathering resources to craft rubbish that enables you to craft other rubbish. As you would imagine this all ends up being terribly time consuming. There are areas in which you can venture where PVP is automatically enabled but I found this even less enjoyable thanks to the griefing.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Sound / Voice / Music[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]5[/b] - Nothing particularly stands out from the generic fantasy lute-based music to the chopping of trees or chipping away of stone. Each action sounds like you would expect when performed, whether that is casting a large fireball to singe and enemy or to the skinning of a fox or deer. I don't recall there being any voice acting but I stand corrected if there is (and if there is, it's very minimal so much so that its not even noticeable).[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Replay value[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]3[/b] - Thanks to the god-awful gameplay loop of gather, craft, gather, craft,  I personally never want to touch the game again. Your mileage may vary if you enjoy spending hours upon hours chopping down trees or mining minerals from stones.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b][i]Fun Factor[/i][/b][/td]
	[td] [b]2[/b] - The grind is real with this one. In order to advance in any skill or attribute there is an inordinate amount of grinding that is required unless you purchase XP boosters. Coupled with an inventory system that will have you encumbered constantly, no storytelling whatsoever and the fact that you can't simply explore the whole world in PVE mode makes this one a no-go for me. If you find any of the three mentioned above bothersome, [b][i]Albion Online[/i][/b] will not be the game for you.[/td]

The grind and progression are satifsfying and not too long. Having premium is necessary (!) imo, but very easily gotten.

NEGATIVES: Only one server in Washington for a Global game = constant lag for everyone not from NA. I get frequent disconections and worse than that, in a full loot pvp game to have lag and constantly get killed by melee guys hitting me from 5 meters with a basic attack is SO frustrating.

One of the things runescape did and i think albion online should do is have 2 servers. 1 with the main game and 1 that resets every 3-6 months to keep players roped in and give them that awesome feeling of everyone running around collecting tier 2-4 materials with maybe a 2 or 3x fame gain, grouping up with new alliances and conquering the world. Coming in as a brand new player, i find is very difficult. I only have 50 hours logged in and as a new player I'm way out matched in tier 5 gear compared to someone with tier 8.

Like many i was very concerned about the ""p2w"" aspect as you can directly purchase better items however with the way the game works, if you dont learn the meta, dont learn how to actually play, someone in tier 4 -5 armor (insanely cheap with in game silver) can and will best someone in t8 (the peak and extremely expensive even with gold as the paid currency) armor. 

This games combat cares more about an individuals skill as opposed to their items. OBVIOSLY better items = better stats and damage, but learning the meta is key, which weapons counter others, all the good stuff. so in that sense, the game is not pay to win because no matter how much money you spend, unless you put in the time and effort to learn the game, anyone with more experience will run circles around you and then you will just feel stupid for blowing $40 - $50 on gold for items only to lose it in mere minutes.

As for the rest of the game, the gathering, the crafting, the personal islands and farming (actual farming, not grinding farming) this game is absolutely fantastic. If you like a real, simulated economy this game is absolutely your game. The mountain region has only the basic trees available but an absolute metric ton of ore so a great tactic for earning money is to go to a region with lots of trees, cut them down, then make your way to the mountain region for a heafty profit.

as i said in the beginning, this game is everything i had hoped it would be and is absolutely one of my new obsessions. PLEASE do not let people scare you away with calling the game ""p2w"" because its simply not true. earning money is not hard at all in this game, im at 35 hours and i have already earned enough money to pay for 2 months of premium.

Contrary to other reviewers, I find the graphics quite charming if not high-end. It is classless and you can level up every avenue - every gathering, crafting and combat-orientated skill-line that you please. I, however, just didn't find it fun.

Every skill is a grind, with no particular quest or story driven engine. You kill monsters, chop trees and craft the same set of daggers until you level up that skill. Then you start killing higher level monsters, chop slightly rarer trees and craft slightly better daggers until you repeat the process. It's a grindfest through and through. It's not dissimilar to RuneScape in this respect, but the nostalgia of playing RS in Internet Explorer on my lunchbreaks in early high school tinted my decision into acquiring this game, and led me into something that just isn't engaging outside of PVP.

The PVP works quite well if you're in a group. However, as a crafter or a lonewolf, you will find that the exclusivity of resources to harsher PVP zones will make your life very difficult. Even more to the point, the lack of fast travel makes visiting different hubs both a chore and a nightmare for those trying to bring six hours worth of materials to a different stash. You will in all likeliness lose them to roving gangs, who will gank you and cost you six hours of your life in a heartbeat.

It's a hardcore MMO, and I appreciate the extents to which they went to make it realistic and immersive in this respect.

FURTHERMORE, with premium you get 300 ""Learning points"" and 20 poins every day afterwards for a month, which you can use to quickly learn crafting skills or gathering skills (they use a lot of points) and when I saw how much just 1 skill needs, for example: Woodcutting, not even 1 month of premium will be enough to max it out!

Pros:
Great and constant progression.
No levels, quests.
Great artstyle, throw back to Runescape but updated.
Almost everything you get in the game is crafted by the player or others.
Full Loot PvP.
Dungeons/Raids/GvG you name it.
Truely open and allows you to do what you want to do as long as you are willing to work towards it.
HUGE Destiny skill system that if you are a mad lad you can unlock everything.
No classes, no armor restrictions, make your character play the way you want and wear what you want.

Cons:
Grindy, I mean, REALLY grindy (like most sandbox games for progression, but BDO has nothing on this.)
Alot of the game is spent gathering and crafting, which some people might be turned off by and can be mind numbing.
Fairly steep learning curve and coming into it late and finding a decent guild could be hard. 
The later game is extremely important to have other players with you constantly (but its a mmo, so its expected)
Combat system can feel extremely weird at times.
Was made with intentions to also be played on mobile so has a very limited UI and you can tell it has had mobile in mind.

Overall, if your looking for a great sandbox game that is chill or the most intense life or death situation in your life. I would totally give this game a shot.

2. The initial 2000 Gold and premium status have a huge influence on your opinion on the game, and I strongly believe reviewing the game without these is just unfair.

As it stands, I'm looking forward to continue playing this game. I haven't been player killed once, and I'm T3 after 30 hrs.

This mean I can look forward to perfecting my craft skills. A gatherer,crafters players dream. 

Grab a trial key, or risk it ( like i did) as I don't think you'll be disappointed. I haven't even touched farming, or guild, or pvp.  So much to look forward too. Also, it seem very possible to grind more than enough to pay for premium without using real money.

One reason is that its very special and not all kind of players will have fun with it...
Maybe these points help you:
You should consider to NOT play the game if:
- You like Stories and Quests
- You dont like grind
- You expect sandboxing like minecraft
- You like a huuuge open world with secrets to be found
- You like a very friendly world
- You dont like PVP
- You only want PVE content (or at least the choice to)
- You want to play alone...
- You like owning and wearing special nice gear for long time

You should consider to play the game if:
- You like highly competitive pvp action
- Working hard to achieve higher ranks in something is your motivation
- You like economic games where the market is close to be real
- You dont want to spent much money (Premium can be achieved by gaming easily)
- You like action together with yuor guild/friends (farming / pvp / pve)
- You like if skill matters more than money/gear
- You like if battle tactics matter more than money/gear
- You dont like static classes to be chosen upfront

Graphics: The graphics are a bit blocky, but it is a style i enjoy and it means lower end PCs can run it, so that os also a plus. Low end graphics, but it runs smoothly on most modern PCs

Music/Sound: The music could use a nit more variation, but the natural ambience of the world is fine.

For a game that costs $30 already to have premium content that DOES directly affect basic gameplay and progression is definitely NOT a good thing.

Things like Guild vs Guild, Zergs vs Zerg (massive battles), managing/attacking and stealing from terroritries, crafting, farming, grinding farms, ganking, gathering and much more are experiences that are really amazing in Albion.

Pros;
Fun raw brawls. Decent graphics, Player base if you hunt for the gem guilds, no quests (i hate quests? love the open sandbox). Market system is designed well with gold/silver and items i feel.

Cons; 
Too long of a skill grind to change skills or learn new skills. Too limited choices on aspects. Could expand on rares for island. Game makes it hard on new players to max skill.

So instead I decided to go in solo, meet new folks and figure it out.  The game design is clever and severely organized.   I mean severe because it is too tight, too constricted, there are no loop holes to find an edge or some uniqueness in your class.   Open world pvp is really about mounting and dismounting.  Quite dull.   You either out number or they out number although it is quite fun to defend territories and to fight in blobs.  I've played full loot games before and really they are okay if there are systems in place so it just isn't about hunting farmers.   

Pros
--Original skill trees
--Open World
--Nice Art
--Cool mass fights 
--Love the idea about having territories. safe haven with storage.
--Full loot
--Gathering was pretty interesting.
--I liked the different mounts.
--Transporting loot was scary, fear of getting ganked and losing tons.


Cons
--Racist, homophobic, sexists player base tolerated by developers.  eg, Arayn Hood guild.  Constant gay jokes.  Use of the term ""whore"" not against TOS.  
--Clunky PVE.  No tab target.  Weird clicking.  Can't set up your keys well.
--Open world PVP is not strategic.  It is all about mounting and dismounting rather than fighting.
--The game design is too tight for items so the skills or builds are too similar.
--The grind to level is real.   To get to level 99 to 100 on a weapon will take around 9 hours of grinding.   That is one weapon.  Worse than a korean MMO.  
--Can't get xp from Arena it is just practice.
--Everything costs in game time.  The elite weapons to level will cost boatloads and you can lose them to ganks.
--Don't have the feeling like you are fighting over anything but the best resources.  Even then they could be ninjaed.
--Not balanced to let low level players particpate well in large battles. 
--Weapons are all sort of the same.  You know how some games the classes feel totally different.  Not this one.
--PVE tanking sucks.   No opportunity to optimize mitigation or health.  You basically have what everyone else has.
--PVE healing sucks.  Clunky.  You can't even group your own health bar with everyone else. 
--long queues for pve
--long queues for arena
--group pvp is too much about aoe.   Really they dropped all the energy drain / windwall stuff that seem to make the pvp complex.  Now it is about a tank stun.  then aoe the crap out of 5-6 second stunned group.  Not very deep TBH.

I still have like 3 months of premium but won't go back.  The grind was too much.  In best scenario you can get 140k an hour in black zone.   Typically you are closer to 100k per hour.   Also the amount of bigotry was high.  I actually had never seen it so constant across multiple guilds.  Devs fault?  sorta.   I mean LOL allows for the calling of noob, idiot, moron, etc.  But you can't be derogatory against groups of folks (female, homosexual, etc).   So in league of legends you get a lot of first and very little of the second.   There is a TOS against racism and I did see a 1 day ban for it but that is only in general chat it seems.",1533466788,1533466993,False,3,1,0.47789531946182251,1,True,False,False

Would be a more accurate title for this game, everything in this game revolves around going from point A to B whilst clicking on resource nodes or hostile creatures along the way, resource nodes takes quite a while to harvest, so most of your time is spend doing nothing but watching a bar fill up for resource collections.

Don't get me wrong this game probably had potentiel at one point in its life, but everything is based around grinding of huge proportions, every new tier of resource you collect and turn into usable materials, requires the previous tiers resources, so you end up having to grind every single previous tier every time, or buy it off some of the other suckers that spend their time grinding it on the local markets.

The graphics is nothing impressive either, yet it seems to strain a lot of machines for no reason, the player models and npcs walking around is of such low quality and fidelity that some of it, looks like something they ripped straight out of some of the first versions of Runescape, the landscapes and buildings look nice however and have a slightly higher degree of detail, it doesn't excuse the complete bollocks that is npcs and player models though.

To those looking for a more directed way of playing, such as quests or stories, there is none, you will be disapointed and your time will have been wasted if you go into this expecting questing or stories, this is just my experience from the first 6 tiers of resources, and by the time I got through those I was exhausted and tired of the grinding.

If you're european as well, like me, this game is definetly not worth buying, there is no servers nearby, I'm guessing it's all placed in the U.S, seeing as the game runs at a constant ping of AT LEAST 150ms, everything you do WILL be delayed, and combat you will often end up taking damage from things that was very clearly not near you on your own screen, but alas, the latency is a killer.

Which brings me to this point, PvP is supposedly a main drive of this game and at higher tiers you will lose ALL your gear and inventory upon being killed in the wilds, this is not a negative per say, it's part of the game and what they wish to achieve, but it needs to be said as it's a pretty important part of the gamer later, however again if you're in europe, the latency issues will make your life hell, turning pvp and npc combat into a complete shitfest.

What initially drew me in was the very beautifully crafted landscapes from the screenshots, and the first hour or two of the game is alright, but if you've played the game an hour, you've essentially tried everything it has to offer, grinding, more grinding, dying and grinding some more.",1533397032,1533397032,False,21,1,0.609075367450714111,7,True,False,False

One of the biggest drawbacks other reviewers say about this game is the grind, which is completely wrong. The grind in this game is totally up to you. You don't need to grind alot to do anything.

This game got the best guild system I have seen before, it also has the best player-driven economy system. Each guild has their own Discord channel where group events are happening. Big guilds offer plenty of stuff to do every day. 

On steam you get a month premium and 2k gold (worth roughly 2.2 million silver) when you buy the base game. This is plenty to help you get started. Been playing for 120 hours at the writing of this review and I have a healthy economy, and I have spent roughly 50% of the starting gold.

Remember to join the official Discord channel for this game, and check guild recruitment channel. Plenty of guilds are ready to welcome you aboard and help you out with anything you need. 

The game is almost overcrowded, there are lots of non-steam players online. The community and guilds is definetely the strength of this game, so get a microphone, and hop into your guilds voice channel.

Albion Online is a more accessible, Fantasy/Medieval EvE Online at the cost of some depth. The game is grindy as heck, but if you want a truly player-run and driven sandbox game, this is for you.

There's something for everyone, for those who don't care much for PvP, there's trading, gathering and crafting that can keep you busy for hours on end. The grind is long but enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. You can play the market, get rich(er), supply the people who do play the PvP stuff, buy land, work with taxes and take part in the player run economy. The trading/gathering aspect is just all really chilling, great thing to do to spend time & also chat to friends or guildies or do in the background.

There's also a really nice housing/island system which can become a huge (but rewarding) time sink. You can also decorate the island how you like, and farm/fish there.

If you're a huge fan of PvP, EvE Online style this game is definitely for you. First to talk about the combat though, the game is very interesting with the combat, it's a MOBA styled system, and skills are made up depending on the gear/armour you wear and weapon you use.

Inside Albion Online for PvP you'll be fighting over land, resources, ganking people to steal their items, there's usually fairly big battles daily. On top of the world PvP (which occurs in Red Zones or Black Zones on the map), there's also Arena styled PvP which you can solo or team queue for. There are some zones where PvP is full loot drop, and others where PvP is toggable.

For people who are a fun of PvE elements, the game has both instanced (in the form of Expeditions, both solo and in a holy trinity situation) and non-instanced dungeons that are in the different areas/zones on the map. The game offers both PvE and PvP for fans and manages to balance it well imo.

Customization is a huge thing too, there is no strict defined class like in other games, you can mix and match your builds how you like and there's such a huge diversity of items and abilities you can pick from it's great. You can experiment, from weapons ranging from crossbows, to dual swords, to hammers and staffs.

The game definitely has some cons though, the 5 Blue Zone cities, feel a bit underpopulated, however there is a patch coming out on the 31st of July that is (hopefully) going to fix that.

Some people also might not be a fan of the Gold system, which is similar to EvE's plex system. I honestly don't have an issue with it, no matter how much money you drop in to buy gold, you are still going to have to grind to be able to use any of the gear you could buy.

Overall, this game is the closest we'll get to a medieval fantasy EvE Online experience. The user interface is simple and so are the controls, you can also play the game optionally on a mobile client on the go. Sure it's not as indepth as EvE is, but it makes up for it by being much easier to get into and hop in and play. There's plenty to do to keep you occupied, and the game is a great sandbox MMORPG. There's a few flaws but the positives far outweigh the negatives.

But it is without a doubt lacking something vital, and that factor is fun. This game isn't really anywhere near the definition of an RPG. For an open world DIY dungeon crawler pvp game, you can't really call it an RPG. It's really just a game about grinding levels and getting rich and picking the one of three ways to do it, that is; killing players, afk gather resources for endless hours, or do PVE runs that don't do as well as the other two. 

This game when it comes down to it felt more like a second job than a game. Where any good guild requires that you spend x ammount of hours doing activites, and small groups with friends just get squashed by organized tryhards.

Base building is okay, and the market system is phenomenal, as a trader of crafter you can find and abuse gaps in the market with your skills to make profit. But to buy what, more goods, to get more money, to get more goods?

The game uses the pitch ""everyone matters"", For the late game that is true. but for early-mid game. your first 100+ hours. It means little to nothing to anyone. You're only impact is just farming early resources that noone could be bothered to grab themselves for cheap prices, due to how inflated that end of the market already is.

All in all I enjoyed Albion Online, but they game still lacks individuality. There are no quests beyond the tutorial, unless you count dungeon raids with rarely any dialouge. It's just too open concept for me. It's great to have your game allow you to make your own quests and adventures, but how is anyone gonna hear about it? what reward other than a remenicent chuckle are you gonna get from taking that territory that makes you, your friends, your guildmates stand out other than a new place to spend time to fight for?

This game transitions from everything you wanted out of runscape and turning it into a World of Warcraft themed spin-off MOBA title that requires a ""no life"" lifestyle to grind up and attain.

This game needs definition, I don't want a tier 3 enchanted iron longsword forged by my friend John, I want a legendary boss drop schematic from the summer event where all the players in the game fought against an army of the undead, off of the supreme necromancer ""Thy'kolet the Ashen of Bleak Sands"" which allowed John our master blacksmith to craft a near one of a kind designed sythe weapon called ""Bleak Harvest"" bound to his account with a unique personality and design, not necessarily OP, but showing some interest in lore, market value, and in that crafter and user's reputation as Albion's greatest.

In conclusion, I can't really reccomend this game. There a difference between having fun and having satisfaction. Nothing in this game ever grabbed or compelled me. It was just ""What do I do now?"" ""Guess i'll just do that for now."" ""Okay, i did that, what now?"" Mindless gameplay of just deciding what to do and then spending more time than it should take to accomplish that, and it takes you a while to figure out that theres no fun, and no one treats it like you should, thats not what we bought this game to do. This game can easily develope character but that takes time, effort, and planning. There is no indication that they are taking that direction. If you enjoy endless grinding, Open word DIY Adventure PvP, than you will enjoy Albion online, I just don't fall under that category, and can't recommend this title for anyone expecting an actual RPG.",1531161213,1531161213,False,14,0,0.543923735618591309,6,True,False,False

It's been a while since i've seen such a p2w game.

Good:
a) Mob / Dungeon Mechanics: i'd say its the strongest point of the game, if you don't play well, you'll die in a matter of seconds in a dungeon
b) Banhammer is really good for both bots and ilegal gold buyers.
c) The graphics are so basic it runs almost ANYWHERE, cross platform is a real plus

Bad: 
a) you can buy GOLD through the game with $, yes legally. Which automatically turns it p2w as you can just put $ into the game and get top gear that'd take forever to get by just playing
b) the progression is so basic is sad. basically... kill mobs. until you reach t8
c) The premium system is just too unbalanced, if you play without premium you're in such a disadvantage against the ones that have it. You *can* buy premium through the game, but good luck getting the 2500 gold each month (specially the first month you need to get it) without dropping some $ into the game.
d) Dungeons are all the same layout and same mobs. Just 'stronger'. Super boring
e) pvp pretty much boils down to who has the best gear
f) With such basic graphics you would assume it'd fly in big massive battles, well, it doesn't
g) Lacking basic mmo features like splitting items in your inventary easily, moving them from/to your warehouse, wasd movement

---{OVERVIEW}---{OPINION}
One thing I love about Albion Online is that provides players with a unique 'Destiny' Board, which is a skill tree that allows them to lead their character into a pathway that they want without having to create another character, whether its wanting to go into dungeons and fighting monsters along with bosses, or just being laid back and crafting and gathering materials to craft and sell or to keep for yourself. I love it how the market is a playerbased system and that items that are purchased on the market are from other players that have crafted it themselves.... oh I forgot, There is A LOT of grinding, A L O T.

[b] I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME HOWEVER !!!! The price for what its worth is simply not met, even on sales it only goes down to $20USD (I bought it on the summer sale), but definetely wait for the sale or hopefully they just reduce the price in general.

The game moderators and game masters will blantly silence you if you say anything about the game that isnt good. They will 100% ban your forum account and reddit account if you go agaisnt them if they dont like the game.

The game itself is extremely grindy and pay to progression. Not only that but there are people that are abusing the invite system and they let them do it. Yet it breaking how money works. 

Also you think being able to custom build your character? Nawh not a chance you have to follow a meta to a degree or you will never win a GvG or hellgate due to not being a meta build.

I wouldnt touch this game with a 10 foot pole unless you like abusing mods and game masters and people that can freely break rules and get away with it but if they dont like you they will mute you and try to ban you.

Also the combat is pretty bald you got about 6 buttons to press as skills and thats about it compared to other mmorpgs

The game also randomly crashes and has had this problem since launch and they have yet to even attempt to fix it.

Game was also also said it would be able to handle big scale fights like 50 vs 50 and 100 vs 100+ well yeah it cant even do that either the servers lag so hard that its almost imposble to zvz so the thing the adverted the most you cant even do.

As a result the controls are horrible. Fixed camera means you cant zoom in or out and this makes playing the game entirely too difficult. Lots of enemies use abilities that give the telescope AoE warning zone you have to get out of. If a tree or building happens to be in your view you cannot see to dodge these abilities. There really isn't a lot of questline or lore content so I'd say its more of a sandbox feel. The PVP is Eve like in the risks. You can really lose everything if youre in the wrong zone and die or just decide to die upon getting knocked down.

The game is very complex when it comes to crafting, classes and pretty much everything else and enjoyable in other ways but with the limiting factors Ive mentioned I can't in good conscience recommend this title as is. Hopefully they decide to focus on making the game better to play control wise and camera but from what I'm seeing this is not the devs plan.

1. This game is not pay to win in it's current state because there is not a cash shop and even if I paid  real life money for 1750 gold then sell for around 980-1001 silver per 1 gold I still have to craft my gear and weapons to that desired level. It's not like other games I played where weapons and armor are bought and instantly used. It takes time to be able to equipt and use it. And yes I realize it's easier paying but you don't have to spend money for the silver.

2. I like how you can progress and do anything you want to do without the fear of ruining your character or having to make a new one. If you want to fish and mine ore, you can do that and if you want to aoe heal then switch to duel weild swords and leather armor then you can do that to. 

3. Group fighting is a blast and cooperation is needed for some dungeons and it makes the game more enjoyable having those features available. Combat seems very smooth and you almost always know what hits you when fighting mobs. 

---Some things I don't like about the game---

1. I dislike how almost everywhere you travel to seems like a continuation of the area you just visited and it seems like there is not enough monster variety here. It's an open world game but feels like it's linear. It gets very repetitive.

2. I understand the reason for adding a balancing feature for PvP, but if I'm pveing I should not be penalized.  So if I buy a 3 enchantment staff master piece quality and use it in an area that's tier 3 because I'm to weak for t4 I suffer from cluster debuff which is designed to scale PvP but really fuvcks you up in pve. Like the weapon power says 1065 in town but then it shows 768 outside of town. I'm not getting my full weapons potential .

3. The marketplace for item trading. I'm not to found of the marketplace. If you want something you can get it instantly in this game. I feel like it would be better if the only way to get things were to craft it and sell yourself through means of contacting players in game via global or setting schedule for a meet online. 

4. Why should silver be tradable and have no weight. So I can walk and travel around the world with 1 billion silver and open a trade and give it to somebody. Seems a bit weird. I can barely hold 166 carrots so why should I be able to hold 1 billion silver , *face palm*

This game is still just a baby and I enjoy every moment of it. Seems very enjoyable and you should give it a try as well.",1529896397,1529896397,True,1,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

A few things that I can appreciate after playing a couple of days:
-Super friendly user interface
-Friendly and helpful community
-Very responsive and fluid movement and combat which makes it so statisfying
-Runs well on Ultra settings on a budget PC (haven't been in a massive fight yet tho)
-Progressive and in depth crafting system
-Very cool class system (your gear determines your class), besides that, there are no classes so you can't mess up your character!
-NOT P2W

Have a nice day :)

Unfortunately this only lasted for around 10 hours of gameplay in a game that requires hundreds upon hundreds of hours in order to progress. For future reference, the weapon and armor system works as the following: The items are seperated by tiers, each requiring their own materials (which also require all materials leading up to them to make) and producing their own strength of items respectively from tiers 1-10. tiers 1-3 are starting equipment, and tier 4+ is the equipment that branches off into their unique playstyles.

   For pros and cons, jump to the PROS section.

    After 31 hours of gameplay I've come to realise just how much this game is not worth playing and committing to. I honestly wanted to play 90-100 hours before giving my review, but I couldn't stand it anymore and had to quit.

    To start off with, I would like to note that this game is a diamond in the rough, the only problem is that it is also under 2 miles of bedrock and the people escavating for it are severely underpaid, undermotivated, and might be physically impaired, metaphorically.

    PROS:

-The weapon system in this game is beautiful. There are many weapons that all have unique movesets and each one feels like it has its own unique playstyle. I really enjoyed trying out all of the different weapons and abilities and I think its a really solid building point to start with.

-The character controls in this game are very reminiscent of MOBA games, and it's very easy to get used to if you have any experience in any of these games. If you do, then it will feel very familiar and friendly when you try to play.

-The economy in this game is very strong theoretically with the different features available, and i think that this game will be very long living if it can gain traction. The market and black market options available for this game means that you can either get money for selling to fellow players, or defaulting to the base value by selling to the black market if the price falls too much.

-Lastly, you are unable to swap equipment in the middle of a fight, which means for a game that is so focused on PVP you won't get into fights with people who suddenly switch to a much stronger, slower weapon to hit you with a special ability unique to that class which will do half of your health, just to have them swap back immediately afterward.

CONS: TOO MANY
To keep this simple I won't write too much about each individual point, just know there is a good reason i put all of these in here.

-The experience system is pay to win because you need premium in order to progress your character at a seemingly normal pace since if you PAY you can only get 20% of the experience you need before you can level up.

-Even with above point it takes too long to level up (estimated 10 hours or so to get from tier 4 to 5 with nonstop grinding while also using the pay to win leveling system)

-Item tiers have too big power spikes, if you fight someone with one single piece of tier 5 equipment when you both have tier 4 for everything else you will get DUMPSTERED because of that one item, as for why this is a problem see the above point.

-Dungeons are free for all, so if this game gets bigger and there are 5-10 teams per dungeon you will all be sitting and farming and fighting over one single mob spawn.

-The arena is a joke. The only 5v5 team option is so unbalanced and the matchmaking is so bad you can be in solo queue and have the lowest item level enemy on the other team be higher item level than your highest item level player. not to mention the gameplay is genuinely bad king of the hill.

-The arena never actually gets matches even though this is a pvp game primarily because, as i just stated, its boring and unbalanced. a genuinely unfun and frustrating experience not worth trying.

-Arena does not care about your item levels as long as you match the huge range of minimum and maximum level items, meaning you can be fighting someone with a max tier weapon on your very first match if you get unlucky enough, even if you have all minimum requirement equipment.

-The pvp does not clearly show status impairments, and it is hard to tell whether you or a teammate has been stunned, snared, silenced, etc.

-Too hard to tell how a character is going to play, what their damage is going to be like, and how fast they're going to be just by looking at them because all the characters seem to mesh together in appearances.

-All helmets and boots have the same stats regardless of if they are tank, damage, or agility focused, only difference is the abilites, meaning you can be fighting a tank that for some reason is the fastest person you've ever seen.

-All the mobs are more or less the same enemies just different levels, feels like a nonstop grind from level 1 to max regarless of who you're fighting.

-If you want to farm for tier 5 equipment or better you are REQUIRED to be inside PVP areas, meaning that you are physically unable to just be a skilling character because you will be murdered and robbed nonstop.

-The black market, the system in the game which is supposed to let merchants regulate the prices of goods in each branch town, is in the middle of a PVP area, meaning that unless you want to risk losing all of your stuff, you're not going to be making any money or regulating the price of anything.

-selling gold for silver (the two different currencies in the world) and vice versa has a tax on it, meaning that it's virtually pointless to try to buy and sell it unless you're garunteed a large profit.

-Latency problems make it impossible to kite enemies out without getting within strike range, which sounds good to prevent people who want to abuse range to do damage inconsequentially, until you realise you're taking the same about of hits as a full defence tank and each one is doing double to triple the damage.

-Resources take so long to respawn that people will fight over them constantly with as little as 5 people per area, even if there are 30 or so spots to gather from.

-When you try to do the above, and just farm out resources, you can't do so peacefully because there will be agressive mobs (and players at tier 5 and up) there 90% of the time that also stop you from gathering if they hit you.

-There is a system in the game that makes it so that you can get stronger weapons by getting shards from dungeons and turning them into relics, but this system also makes it so that each tier of artifact (3 tiers per equipment tier) makes the ones below it completely obselete with much higher base stats and all around better abilities, while also costing the equivalent of 10 dollars USD in silver to buy for tier 4, the lowest available tier.

-There is a leveling system that makes it so if you have a premium account you can generate ""learning points"" which you can then spend to skip from 20% experience to the next level in ANY skill at all, meaning unless you have premium, good luck with taking that 10 hours of farming and turning it into 50 with no added benefit.

-With the previous point in mind might I remind you that the leveling in this game takes FOREVER. after 31 hours of playing this game, 20 of which being nonstop grinding, I did not unlock tier 5 for ANYTHING and this is while using the learning point system to its fullest.

-dungeons are boring and do not reward the player, simple as that, also impossible to solo dungeons because of the strength of the mobs.

-Players can and will tax you too high for using their equipment, with very little despairty between competetors.

-Lastly, Toxic players who say obscene, rediculous things, who try to make global chat inflammatory, are not punished at all. I know this for a fact because while such a person was saying such things there was a moderator witnessing the entire thing and doing absolutely nothing.",1529119053,1529278935,False,65,5,0.743638038635253906,10,True,False,False

Albion throws you into a fantasy world sandbox that has a unique art style and a very easy interface. The look and playability are spot on for any casual mmorpg fan.  

That's where the good points end however, while I knew that the game had a good amount of crafting in it (which I usually enjoy in mmo games) this game takes it to the extreme. You'll spend hours grinding out the same stones, trees, and plants to make your next level of armor or housing item. And make no mistake, without crafting you literally won't ever advance. Every single item in game is crafted. PVE content is woefully lacking. There are a few ""daily dungeons"" you can run but they almost never change and the only drops you'll see are some silver coins. That's it. 

PVP is mostly high level people running around in select zones that you won't want to visit until you can hold your own (or risk getting killed and getting all your stuff stolen).

There is some cool ideas in place for player housing (both public and instanced) but again, you have to grind out so much material to make your property decent it's very overwhelming. 

The game is a gigantic time sink of repetitive tasks - for some this may sound like fun but I'd avoid the game until it implements more features, content, and quality of life upgrades. For now, I'd say avoid.",1529278004,1529278004,False,34,3,0.629951059818267822,0,True,False,False

A sandbox should allow you to do things that don't revolve around combat.
A sandbox should be set in a believable world.

This game is none of those things. Back in the day, games such as Shadowbane, Star Wars Galaxies, Anarchy Online, etc. were sandboxes. You COULD head out and do anything you wanted; they were worlds that revolved around themselves. Players impacted those worlds, sure, but they were living, breathing worlds (in my opinion).

I know it says I've only played a couple hours, but I played almost 200 hours before this game released on Steam. Albion Online is NOT a living, breathing world. NPC's stand there as though their lives revolve around entertaining you. Ever watch 'The Truman Show'? Well, in that movie people would only act a certain way when the protagonist was around. When he wasn't around, they'd just sit back and wait for him. I don't see the NPC's having lives outside of being a 'control console' where you conduct duties such as trading, crafting, etc. There is no storyline around them. They have no wants or needs. They are not people.

The people you DO meet in this game are neckbeard fedora wearing virgins. You ask them a simple question such as ""hey I'm new. How do I get to town?"" and you'll have some guy replying ""wasimuuu kappa kappa anime anime"". What does that mean? Why are you speaking weeb to me? Is this an anime?

Then you realize the people playing the game think real life is anime. They think the game is real life. Their lives revolve around the game because this game is a time-sink. Of my 200 hours in the game, I only enjoyed maybe 10 hours of it and that was when I first tried PvP (even though I got rekt).

Stay away from this 'game'. There is no depth. It's a mobile game made for the PC.

1- They are doing daily maintenance, but there is 7/24 lag spikes ( i have hc chars in diablo so dont dare blame my net)
2- Game has no graphical optimization, fps is very low
3- Game has no pve content compared to other mmos, after a week or two you must go to dungeons in pvp zones if you want to do some pve stuff, they are full of zergs with high gear veterans who will run through you like paper and loot your whole inventory no matter what tier you wear, before you can kill a mob. there are scouts everywhere, they might even join your party in disguise and direct their zerg to you.
4- Markets are seperated and isolated, city markets are dead, noone buy anything even when you sell it for 1/4 price
5- You must move and locate in main hub city called caerleon as soon as you can, which is surrounded by fulll pvp zones, that place has the only market activity and portals to end game continent.
6- The community is helpful, they always answer, but the game itself isnt new player friendly at all.
7- Yes its a gathering game, but more like players farming other players
8- All rare sources i see is always looted no matter what hour i play
9- Devs are seems like more interested in ""balancing"" the game then make actual improvements
10- if you plan to play solo like me, unless you are a masochist this game isnt for you, dont get fooled by solo guide this solo guide that in youtube etc. they only exist in non-pvp zones, as soon as you set foot in a pvp zone you ll die in 2 seconds and lose your whole inventory, gathering in high zones only possible with guilds.

This is prolly not a starter mmorpg, I put in a fair few hours at all the tasks, thankfully most of them are mundane enough that you can watch youtube tutorials on your other screen to learn the basics of most of systems of this player based economy.

But the grind is mind numbingly boring whatever direction you go (even with premium) you will be sick of killing the same mobs if you are pushing combat and armor research or sick of chopping trees or farming if you go that route.

The game is a colossal time suck if you decide to go it alone.  If you can search and find people to guild up with I would say a measure of fun could be had.  But a good portion of us are adults with responsibilities that make games an occasional predictable place to meet online.  Therefore finding a guild with people who will spoon feed a noob on his/her schedule will be challenging and yet necessary.

Ganking seems to be a better way to grind fame, unfortunately I am not enough of a d!ck to plunder other people's time (ie resource farming etc). Yeah, I said it...ganking is stealing people's time.  The most finite resource we all have is literally up for grabs in the vast majority of the map. One day some social scientist is going to link our behavior online to our behavior IRL and see a link between what we practice doing and what we actually do.

Graphically this is no Japanese or Korean mmorpg (sound also compares poorly) the combat animations are inaccurate (multiple times i was hit outside of the hitbox),  Servers are occasionally laggy during peak periods. Client was very stable though and quite a few of the players were helpful.  Mods seemed pretty mute happy, but I never experienced any grief myself.

Abilities are bound to equipment and the devs push the idea of flexibility (build your own class) but like many other games there is a fairly strong meta for specific builds. The trinity is strong just like many other games that have more structured classes. While you can mix and match for a variety of options, the reality is that in order to be the most effective you can be at your role, the game entails that you cookiecutter for effectiveness. 

They tout a fully player driven economy and they do this by making all gear crafted and the mid-late game crafting stations player owned (among other things). The high end zones are red/black which basically just means open pvp with full player looting. In order to get top end crafting resources you need to be in these zones which in effect pushes players to join a guild for protection. Plus guilds are likely to have crafting stations which reduce your cost (because they have a lower fee). Personally I dislike games that force pvp on everyone. If I want to pvp then I rather join a queue or go to specific zones in order to engage in those activities rather than just simply abusing people that are trying to farm and don't fight back (and since they're probably wearing gathering equipment can't effectively fight back anyways). I find it boring to grief people just because they are in ""my guild's zone"" or I'm supposed to be incentivized to do so because of material scarcity or because the guild says so. I find the dev's heavy handed methods for pushing pvp tedious. There are a ton of ways to encourage pvp in a non-malicious way and they use none of them. Outside of the reputation system the game design encourages player killing and the rep system is ineffective for discouraging griefing.

They also push the idea of a player driven world ""that doesn't hold your hand"" which is basically just a lack of content. Outside of the excessively brief tutorial there is no questing although there are quite a few NPCs that seem to be prepped for quests, but don't actually offer any right now. So maybe they'll add some in the future (if you're into that sort of thing). Dungeons are just smaller zones with mobs in it but no real boss encounters as you might think about it from a typical MMO. Most of them allow unlimited people (they aren't instances) so they tend to be trivial if you have a lot of people or extremely difficult if you only have a few (the mobs don't scale dynamically). Mobs are effectively just for cash, combat exp, and upgrade tokens and offer no challenge or other reason to engage with the content. Its clear that the expected end game content is simply pvp.

The graphics are tolerable. The controls are alright. The game feels like something from the early 2000s and lacks a lot of the QoL things you would expect from a game in 2018. Combat is effectively tab targetting without the tabbing. You click on stuff and then cast abilities. Some of the skills are ground targetted (aka skill shots) but everything feels pretty clunky. I could write a few pages about the shortfalls of the game, but I don't think it would be constructive or effective. However I'll just quickly mention that gold sellers and bots are common and mods are quick to abuse anyone they dislike while doing little to nothing with actually moderating the community. The game is supposedly single server and you'll see people chatting in a variety of languages in global. There is no way to filter or segregate the chat so you'll have to sift through a lot of text you can't understand. Client side crashes are common.

After more than 70 hours I can't force myself to play any longer. Its simply too boring. For those of you like me I would recommend getting it if you don't mind spending $30 for 50-100 hours of play before you lose interest, otherwise just avoid it completely. Based on my experience with other gamers my description probably has them chomping at the bit to start playing it. lol. Some people apparently really enjoy games with no actual game to it.

In the short time I played there were quite a few things that I disliked.
-No camera angle adjustment
If the MOB you are targetting is behind a tree or anything else, you simply have to deal with not seeing it, as the camera is locked in a single birds eye view angle.

-Weight management
With a single cotton plant taking up as much as 6% of your total carry capacity, becoming over encumbered is a regular and frustrating aspect of this game early on.

-MOBs drop less silver than you can make farming matts.
It is faster and far more profitable to simply grind matts than it is to farm mobs, I also ran 2 dungeons which didn't even have a dungeon boss?!?

-No tracking quests
When accepting a quest, there is no map indicator on where to go to complete it. If you accept a quest to kill a bunch of MOB's you simply have to run around and hope that you are heading in the correct direction and that you will run into the correct area.

While I realise that this game is likely to get better with additional time played, I couldn't justify committing almost $40 AUSD to find out when/if that was going to happen.

Paying for this game gives you one months worth of patron status, which is hugely beneficial with 33%-66% additional resources  recieved from farming, however, the fact that this status is initially forced rather than optional on a F2P game is not something I agree with. If I am paying upfront for a game, I don't expect it to have an optional paid monthly subscription.

For the above reasons, I cannot give this game a positive review.
I believe that this should be a F2P game with an optional patron status, or a non subscription game with it's steep up front pricetag.",1527751314,1527751314,False,11,3,0.492454707622528076,1,True,False,False

If you enjoy games with a sense of humor, a fun artstyle, and interesting items or areas, this game is NOT for you. If you enjoy a developed story, this game is NOT for you. If you enjoy the minutiae of tuning your character's combat style, this game is NOT for you. If you do not enjoy excessive grinding, this game is NOT for you! 

Anyway, I had high hopes for this game. But when I found myself quite literally falling asleep after playing it for 10 hours, by stint of sheer boredom, I realized that it was NOT going to be the next MMO for me. As others have said, it's a skinned down, crappy version of what makes other MMOs fun. I'll give ya an overview and describe the world and the combat, as basics.

[b]Here's what you do:[/b] You plop into the world, accidentally kill a few rabbits (poor blighters), and do the starting quests. After that, you arrive in the close-to main world. From there, you go out to gather resources in other areas, then come back and turn those into items. Your skill tree levels up, and you move on to new resources and new items. After a while, you switch to a different area, and do it all over again. There are about 0-8 players in each area, so far as I can tell, and none of them talk in-game. 

[b]The World:[/b] I will say that the environment is smooth, lag-free, and not bad to look at. But that's as far as it goes. There is a heartbreaking lack of interesting content. So far as I got, there are forest areas and winter areas. Half of them are laid out in a near-identical format, and there can't be more than 10 different models in each area (and these are pretty large!). Making things all the more bland, the higher-leveled resources (and weapons, and gear, and EVERYTHING) are nothing more than recolored models of the lower ones. So, there is absolutely, unequivocally nothing exciting about breaking through to a higher level and area. It's just all the same things in the same locations with higher numbers and different colors. 

As far as character models and accessories go, there's nothing to say - in a very bad way. A character is most enjoyable when it can be personalized to look different from the rest. There's nothing exciting about choosing a male or female body (which look identical, besides the boobs) with 7 options for hairstyle and haircolor (from white to black to red, oh boy), and 3 for ... underwear? I don't know why they even bother, considering it will never be seen again. Besides this base bland character, the similar-looking (from lowest to highest tier, remember) utility garb, and a few mounts, there seem to be no cosmetic items. No pets, no clothes, not even a stripe of color for your hair. What's there to be proud about? What's there to enjoy? 

[b]The Combat:[/b] Each weapon has three skills. Each article of clothing has several, but you can only choose one. So a full set of gear lands you six whole abilities, of which three are your offense. Granted, there is a small amount of flavor to them, but in the end... it's insufferably boring. The absolute depth of inventive character combat design seems to be putting another classes' armor on while you use your main weapon, just for a different support skill. And, I should mention, it's very far from as easy as the store page makes it seem to switch weapons. You still have to start with the base version, and then painstakingly level up your ability with EACH piece of gear. They tout it as being better than having classes - it's blander, grindier, and more boring than everything else out there. So it fits the trend for this game, really. 

Anyway, by this point you can tell that I've got a bit of a grudge against Albion. I paid for a counting simulator, and that irks me. And there's plenty more that I can say - the camera doesn't shift, the world map was laid out by a 2-year old, most of your time is spent travelling, etc. - but you get the idea. Somebody hired a good team of people to rip off other MMOs, but without the intricacy, the excitement, the EVERYTHING that made playing them worthwhile. I can't recommend this to anybody.

Minor Personal Issues:
1. Top down limitations - cannot rotate the camera around to find a better angle does make for some annoyances, especially in combat and your target goes into a spot where your camera has a hill or other overhangs blocking your view, preventing you from being able to attack them.
2. Click to Move - There is absolutely no way to alter the movement style away from this, unlike a lot of click to move games which do allow click to move or designated key movements.  Feels like a bit of a devolution of a game feature.
3. Nearly impossible to play on phone - The option was advertised and pushed to encourage players to play via phone.  I have tried on my S9 but the HUD is way too small, even on one of the biggest screens for phones right now. You wouldn't be able to do any sort of PvP on the phone, about the only thing I could do, for a very short while at a time, is gather in Blue Zones only.

Bigger gripes:
1. The Grind - I truly do not mind grindy games, but this one takes the cake.  Skill grinding for the gathering and crafting side is insane.  Even with the Premium Status bonuses of Fame (Name of Experience Points) gain, and the ability to use Talent Points to train most skills after gaining only 20% of the necessary fame to level it up, it's still insane.  Those who end up not paying for the sub...I have no clue how the hell you could even deal with this game at all.
2. The Queues - With the game being on a single server I truly expected the Expedition (Dungeons) and the Arena queues to be fairly decent.  As for most games with dungeon queues the DPS roles typically have a longer queues, that is expected.  Tank and Healers having queue times of over 20 or even 30 minutes is ridiculous.  The number of players seemed like a decent amount, but these queue times make me wonder.
3. The Forced Open World PvP - I like open world pvp in games, if there is a bit of control to it and there is an option to not be forced into it when you are not in the mood for it.  However, After Tier 4 you are forced to go into the PvP zones where people in Tier 8 gear just sit and wait to destroy you when you have no chance in hell.  Unless you get accepted into a Tier 8 guild who will help level you up to that point and help get you geared up, Tier 4 is the end of the game for you.  And good luck getting into a Tier 8 guild, most of them are elite a'holes who wont even consider letting you in unless you are already in Tier 7 or 8 gear.  In other words, this game is not for new players coming in at all.",1527628821,1527628821,False,9,1,0.405867964029312134,0,True,False,False

So Albion Online is an MMORPG sandbox game, that, we know.

I have to say I don't normally play MMORPG's but I picked this one up with 2 friends of mine, and we've been really hooked since the beginning. The game is ton of fun when you play in groups, but beware, if you don't like farming/grinding for gathering resources and crafting stuff, you probably won't like this. It is not for everybody.

Now I know a lot will call it Pay 2 Win. I don't think they're wrong. Upon game purchase from the Steam Store, you get a month long of Premium Status. While you're Premium, you get more resources when you gather them, more Fame (aka XP), you get to gain Focus Points everyday where you won't normally if you weren't Premium, and other stuff. I don't think it is a requirement to be Premium though, but some people might think this as a really negative point to the game (maybe it is but right now I'm having too much fun to worry about that).

You also get to explore Dungeons and other hellish areas with your friends which is also ton of fun, and apparently you get to make raid parties and hunt down other players (in PvP areas)(I'm also not there yet).

So this game is not for everyone but will appeal to people who like crafting and farming.",1527627780,1527627780,True,45,3,0.722285747528076172,7,True,False,False

I have finally found the MMORPG that I have been looking for. Can't recommend this game enough!

Now is a great time to join since the recent launch on steam.

---EDIT-----

I feel like I should add a more detailed review.

Pros:
-- MOBA controls in an MMORPG makes for great PVP and PVE
- No Classes, be as creative as you like
- Stylised graphics
- Everyone is on 1 server, so you will make friends from all over the world, literally
- Economy driven game due to everything being player crafted
- Just like EVE there is no ""Global"" Auction house but more like a market place in each city, which means transporting goods can be a very profitable and is a job of it's own
- Crafting and farming system is not to complex or simple, it's just right
- Personal Island! (not just cosmetic)
- Can have labourers that act as a multiplier to your crafting/gathering
- You can farm and raise animals
- Each weapon and armor piece has it's own stats and abilities, which makes for a lot of fun theory crafting. 
- Due to the nature of the game playing together is more important than ever if you want to succeed. It feels meaningful and fun to work together. 
- Guilds fighting over territories makes for great GvG
- Full loot drop PvP (controlled similar to Eve Online)
- There is a zone for every type of player:
   1. Blue zone    - No PVP
   2. Yellow zone - PVP, but no full loot drop (Reputation loss)
   3. Red zone     - PVP, full loot drop (Reputation loss)
   4. Black Zone  - PVP, full loot drop (No reputation loss)
Drop too much reputation and you will be banned from all zones except Black zone. 
- Plenty of PvE content scattered all around the map that is combined with PvP. (Dungeons, Chests, Hellgates)
- Variety of mounts
- 5 Way faction warfare, coming this summer 2018!

Cons:
- Can be laggy depending on where you are playing from
- Feel like it needs more variety of cosmetics
- Some animations need improving (personally the bow and arrow just looks weird at times)
- Has been crashing for me the past few days (not sure if it was a recent patch, but i'm sure it will be fixed)
- Very addictive
- Needs more PVE Content

The game is not pay to win, but rather pay to progress faster. This is due to the Premium that they have in the game which can easily (no really) be maintained using in game currency. I am not sure why people complain about it when the game can be completely played without a subscription. Games like WoW still charge you a subscription or you don't get to play at all and this game is so much more fun than WoW.

You can buy gold (premium currency) to then sell in game for Silver (in-game currency), but if you are familiar with EVE Online's Plex system, you will understand how this works. It is balanced, as it works on supply and demand. The market determines how much 1 gold is in silver and vice versa. 

If you're like me and have been hopping from 1 MMORPG to another but haven't really found an MMORPG to call home yet. Then do yourself a favour and play this game. I haven't had this much fun in an MMORPG for years.",1526990195,1527603672,True,18,3,0.587498307228088379,0,True,False,False

761890,42356048,76561198026014066,83,1,164,0,164,1527577982,"When I first saw the gameplay for Albion Online I was pretty excited- I love a good MMO, and I also love games like Ultima Online, Runescape and the Diablo series... The crossplay on both my PC and Android tablet was also highly appealing. I've been playing MMOs for almost 30 years- starting back in the days of dial-up modems and MUDS, and I'm sad to say that the reality of Albion Online isn't that great compared to what it could be. 

As any good game developer will know- the core gameplay mechanics of any game are rules, boundaries, challenge, feedback and goals. However- this game is missing many of those, or they are poorly implemented.

For example- the feedback system is severely lacking, and the quest and progression system isn't at all intuitive. You start the game by picking your character appearance, and you're then dropped into the game world to complete a few standard quests to get you started with gear. Beyond that, the game doesn't provide any guidance, and to say that the game doesn't have any ""hand-holding"" is a vast understatement. 

The quest descriptions are vague, and several times I had to rely on my old friend Google to find out how to progress. For example, one quest indicates that you need to search the marketplace for a horse token after meeting an NPC. Naturally, I assumed the marketplace was an in-game place- a location near the start with a number of vendors... There was no indication otherwise, and I hadn't previously been introduced to the marketplace or even knew it existed. I later found that the marketplace needs to be accessed through the UI and is in fact an auction-house style interface similar to Diablo 3's old Auction House. There is no guidance, no tutorial, no indication to really assist you.

These issues must be pretty common, as there are numerous posts scattered across the web providing answers to many of these issues and non-official how-to guides to assist new players. I will say that the community is pretty great, evident when I posted on the in-game Help chat channel and half a dozen people responded almost immediately. 

I'm now almost three hours in, and have completed all the starting quests; crafted several sets of new gear; and have a mount to move more quickly. The last bit of information I was provided from an NPC was to continue the grind- killing generic mobs, harvesting materials, and I'm not sure why... I don't have any other quests and I assume once I finish grinding several thousand points into the journeyman rank something will pop up. 

However- it shouldn't be an assumption or guess. I shouldn't have to keep mindlessly grinding away hoping that something will happen, and all my time hasn't been wasted for nothing.  

A good game should really provide you with a balance of challenge and ability to achieve flow and motivate the player. However, there is no motivation to do so. There is no real backstory, no real character progression other than ""get better gear"", and the game play just feels hollow. 

The fact that there is no levelling system is also a deterrent. Some people might like the idea of improving your character by crafting different sets of gear, but it isn't for me. I like knowing that my hours of killing mobs or completing mindless quests have contributed to something- whether its a new level or skillset. Sure, there is a Fame system, but it is pointless. You can't immediately see your progression, it doesn't seem to have any impact on gameplay, and the leaderboard doesn't even show your ranking for starting players with a humiliating ""your fame level is too low"" to even show on the boards. 

I'd love to see some improvements made, and perhaps they will. In the meantime I wont be going back to Albion any time soon.",1527580936,1527580936,False,7,0,0.501549959182739258,1,True,False,False

This game is so bad I struggle to find words. I've played a great many MMO's, ARPG's, sank 5 years in to EVE online so I've had a little bit of experience in the various niches this game apparently tries to fill and I can say without a single doubt this game fails miserably.

-The GRIND is insane and you don't really get the full picture until you've hit tier 4 (also where the 7 day trial stops you progressing) Every aspect of this game requires some off the most mind numbing, repetitive, soul crushing crap to progress. You wear 3 piece of armour that come in 3 flavours. You have to grind Fame (experience) individually for each piece and that includes every other item you were. Want to wear a cloth helm, better make sure you've grinded it out. On top off that each bit off gear has several variants which you also need to grind out experience on if you want to be competitive late game. I've never experienced anything this bad.

-Its meant to be a sandbox but that's an illusion, you're very limited and again that doesn't become apparent till mid game.

-The graphics are great if your playing IOS game but it looks god awful for a PC game. Everything just looks terrible and feels so clunky.

-The worst combat I've ever tried in an ARPG. In fact its the most mind numbingly bland combat I've ever seen in a PC game in ages. I can only assume it was originally designed as an IOS game and they just never felt the need to improve the combat. The skills you'll be using at the start of the game will likely be your bread and butter late game and that's just insane.

-Its not a solo game, you're forced into PVP at tier 6 and above and that means you can and will get ganked by groups of roaming people who WILL take your stuff. So if you plan to progress you need to prepare for group PVP. 

-Forced PVP so if you just want too relax and farm late game, tough.

I did want to add some positives but I'm struggling. Its just really bad and I can only assume there are alot of shills over inflating the rating on this game.

Which doesn't really help the fun factor. Now you could join a guild and go farm in packs but if your solo for that time you will learn what pain is when you try to sneak into the Teir 5 area's to get some of that next level stuff you need to keep building your skills.

Other then that I have spent hours trying to find places to mine, cut, skin, and so on. Cause all the items already have been taken or people camping out in that area taking what little regens. This brings up another thing. When someone kills or farms a area. It takes time to regen. Now when it regens it won't be fully full. Meaning when someone cuts down a tree 6/6 it will only come back as 2/6 and will take time to go back to 6/6. So even if you find a area where things are there. You will not get full farm. I think these issues have lead me to say wait till the game is free to play. Cause right now it's just not fully enjoyable for folks who like a nice slow paced dungeon crawl without being forced into guilds",1527395802,1527395802,False,17,1,0.554129719734191895,3,True,False,False

After YEARS of being unable to get into an MMORPG, I've finally found my answer. Albion Online is basically Runescape Ragnarok Rust Online and it's glorious. There's barely any quests other than the tutorial, which ends the second you get your donkey. 

Once you have that donkey it's up to you to figure out how you want to exist in this world. For me, it was looking at the weapons and figuring out which one I liked the look of the most (Dual Claws this time), and then working my way towards that. After that, what else? Well, I bought an Island, made my significant other who was playing with me co-owner, built a house there with a chest, and we started pooling all of our items into that one chest. Cue roaming the countryside mining and cutting down literally everything (including copious skeletons and wildlife).

I'm having a blast, I haven't put 20 hours into a game in 3 days since...it's been a long time. I still have so much to do. My goal from here is to get comfortable, make a few gear sets, and run out into the Black Zones (the, ""wildy"" of Albion) and stab some unfortunate dudes who are just trying to mine up their own empire. I'll probably get stabbed a few times as well, but after that? I think I'll fish a bit more, then make it into food, and probably use that to feed the poor helpless souls on our Island tending our crops.

Albion online is great. It's has a genius combat system where your skills are tied to what equipment you have on: 3 for your weapon, one for each of your clothing items, a potion slot (for poisons and the like) and then a food slot. The combat is very similar to games like DOTA or League of Legends, or Diablo with a tad more finesse. This leads to an insane diversity in builds making you come up with new loadouts to suit how you want to play. Sure, I want to stab dudes, but do I want to stab them harder? Maybe poison them? But what if they run? I'll need to catch them. Thus I'm wearing a Mages hoodie, plate chestpiece, and assassin's boots.

Simply put, if you want a game that brings together the idea of casual farming and mining and then nutsack-nailed-to-the-fridge-door PvP where you could lose everything (and probably will, seriously; like half the map is no-man's-land Black Zones where you WILL die to other players and it's almost encouraged) then check out Albion Online. If you're allergic to hitting rocks and trees for several hours then this game might not be your thing, but then you can just get a friend to specialize in crafting and farming while you do the all important stabbing dudes. 

Also, it's not P2W. Like, seriously. You can buy Gold with In-game currency (and Premium, which is pretty important...) and vice-versa, but it doesn't mean anything if you can buy the most important gear if you can't use it. You'll also probably just get ganked and lose everything. Seriously, it's an option but you're going to be paying out the rectum for basic stuff that you can accomplish in-game fairly easily with a few cups of coffee and an afternoon to gank. The fact that at any time you can buy the premium currency, then buy the in-game currency, and buy premium membership with even the in-game silver if you want is a truly wonderful thing: no buying off the market, it's all handled in it's own little UI window.

For real. High reccomendation. Plus it costs like 25 sheks so there's no gold spamming bots. If you'll excuse me, I have stabbings that need to dudes.",1527233686,1527233686,True,3,0,0.502724826335906982,0,True,False,False

Albion is a bit like all of those combined, except worse in every regard. The action gameplay is much like Diablo-esque ARPGs (or MOBAs, but they're also similar to Diablo). The progression system is a simple grind that hearkens back to all those crappy early oughties MMOs that you played because there was nothing else, but still look back to with nostalgia. The sandbox full-loot PvP, player-driven economy and area control are vying for the UO and Eve crowd.

On the surface the game looks decent enough. The mix of ideas and elements is novel and fairly original while still feeling familiar. It's not pay to win (unlike some will tell you—the monetisation system is the same as in Eve, WoW, or Runescape: you can buy game time/premium currency and sell it to other players for in-game money). The basic gameplay feels responsive and fluid, and has good variety.

Beyond the surface things are different. The game feels sterile. It's like the developers did not fully understand what makes the genres they're imitating tick. A lot of the design is just... misguided, I guess. With the gameplay you can tell they tried going for a ""less is more"" approach similar to MOBAs, where each character only has a handful of abilities (in this case, something like 6 in total), but they didn't know how to make those abilities feel fun and good to use, so the gameplay feels bland and repetitive. They wanted the cool, big, and easily marketable MMO battles from games like Eve Online, but the combat system doesn't work for that at all so you end up with a blob syndrome worse than any MMO I've ever played.

They wanted a functioning player-driven economy, so they put a lot of thought into that. I'm glad to say they actually succeeded in a lot of ways, but unfortunately the whole thing is also really overdesigned. Take the crafting materials for example: they wanted to keep all levels of crafting materials relevant, so they made higher-level recipes require lower-level materials. Which, to be fair, sounds good on paper, but they implemented it in the most unimaginative way possible, so now you need bronze bars and iron ore to make an iron bar, or birch planks and chestnut logs to make a chestnut plank. They also wanted to keep all types of materials balanced, so what they did was laid all the recipes in a spreadsheet and made sure that every single material in the game gets used in equal proportion across all the recipes, so crafting greathammers takes iron bars and cloth and crafting a quarterstaff requires leather and iron (not wood, like one might actually expect). I hate this kind of thing, because it makes the game feel too abstract. Like you're playing a spreadsheet.

This game is basically the closest thing the MMORPG genre has come to an esport, and that's not a good thing. I think it's the blandest and most sterile MMORPG I've had the displeasure of playing bar none, but I'm not really the target audience here. The game caters to the crowd that [i]really[/i] enjoyed being the BEST in whatever PvP-driven MMOs they played before. It removes all the superfluous distractions like adventuring, immersion and fun, and replaces them with carefully balanced systems designed to facilitate competitive guild PvP. The game has a decently dedicated fanbase so far as I can tell, so clearly there's an audience for this. I'm just not part of that audience, and if you're a player who values the ""RPG"" in ""MMORPG"", then you probably aren't, either.

[b]TL;DR: It's like the esport of sandbox PvP MMOs. If you really, [i]really[/i] liked being the guild with the biggest epeen on the server in UO or Eve or whatever and always thought everything except fragging other players was a total waste of time, then you're a very sad human being, but this is also probably the game for you.

Was going to give this game a pass, what with another MMO I play having an expansion dropping soon (Elder Scrolls Online, (ESO)), but then I noticed that there was a small minority of reviews going on about how pay-to-win Albion was. Reminded me of Eve Online, and a similar percentage who were always super but-hurt about the risk-reward orientated gameplay in that. That similarity ended up being the nudge I neded to buy Albion and give it a go. I'm so glad I did! Actually, I'm furious at myself that I didn't try this game sooner.

[h1]Addressing the P2W thing[/h1] 
Albion is heavily inspired by Eve Online which uses similar Full Loot PVP and business model. In both games your time and/or money are both valuable resources which are used to drive a unique risk-reward orientated gameplay. The thing that makes PVP extra exciting in such a game is that you are putting actual assets on the line. Assets that you aquired either via time (grinding) or money. In a full loot game it doesn't matter whether you spent time grinding to buy the equipment or bought gold and used it to buy equipment; the equipment itself is of benefit to both you and others. Loading your character up with equipment is a double edged sword. It may help you get an awesome kill or you may find yourself becoming a sweet loot drop for someone else's benefit. It's that rush you can't find anywhere else except in a full loot game. In Eve some of the most exciting fights I took part in involved fighting someone who had paid money to buy a powerful ship which they kitted out in the best mods. It didn't stop us blowing up their ship and taking their stuff. It's not pay to win, it's pay to skip farming. Via either route, an equipped character is still content for themselves and other people. Within the context of such risk-reward gameplay people being able to get equipment faster is only ever a good thing since it's just as likely to benefit others as it is themselves. It's more loot pinatas running around! The big differentiator is having the freedom to take someones equipment/power away from them which is totally possible in Albion, Eve and other similar titles. In fact it's not only possible but also fun and profitable. In a Themepark MMO, then it's true, such a business model wouldn't work because there would be no way to take away someone's equipment/power away from them, therefore their power ceases to be of benefit to anyone but themselves. The discussions from people complaining about pay to win seem to be from people who haven't tried full loot PVP and don't understand the implications that full loot PVP and the business model have on each other. They are judging it the same as they would if the Themepark MMOs they are used to had the same business model, and drawing very erroneous conclusions. Additioinally some complain that you have to buy premium to be competitive at PVE, but many fail to mention you can buy this with in game currency. So no, I'm not personally concerned about the allegations of the noisy minority. My biggest concern is actually how invested will the developers be in bringing new content out, since the thing that killed Eve for me ultimately was a lack of fresh content.

[H1]Details/ First Impressions[/H1]
The closest thing I've played to Albion is Eve Online, so I apologize in advance for the fact that a lot of my thoughts are going to be framed in term of how it compares to that. The universe does feel very similar to the Eve Universe (large map that players can fight over) but graphically the game has a more approachable graphical style and combat that reminds me of DOTA. I can see this game being thoroughly addictive.

The lack of quests asides from the tutorial reminds me of Ultima Online, and helps give the world an organic feeling. When you see people out and about it's because they are pursuing goals they've set for themselves and really helps make the world feel alive (especially when compared to Themepark MMOs and their immersion breaking mechanics like doing quests out of order and having to talk to NPCs you know are dead). 

Like Eve it has a large political PVP system but unlike Eve, while does cater to large scale warfare (Zergs), it also has some systems geared towards smaller scale warfare, and seems to be trying hard to avoid some of the problems Eve is famous for. I think the devs might be able to strike a nice balance between large and small scale warfare. I haven't as yet had a chance to try any of the PVP yet, but I'm really looking forward to it. 

Another strong point in Albion's favor vs Eve; in Albion you can feel like you're getting somewhere in a day (wheras in Eve you feel like you're practically useless at everything for about 3 weeks). That doesn't mean to say that Albion doesn't have a lot of depth to the progress system, but rather thare are some nicities easily attainable by new players (pack oxes to move materials around, and player islands to call home) that lead to us feeling invested in the world a lot quicker. Played Albion for a whole day, and by the end of the first day had an ox, and had helped to build a guildhall. Was a lot of fun, and I hadn't expected to be able to participate in building anything at all for a while, so that was a nice surprise. By the end of the second had started building my own house on my island.

Albion seems to fit in well with things I already love to do in other MMOs. For example in ESO some of the few things I do involve wandering Tamriel like a tourist, gathering materials, and participating in the Market. For a while I've been lamenting that fact that I have tons of currency in ESO but have nothing to spend it on. Albion neatly solves that problem for me since I can do the same things I've been doing in ESO for fun (harvesting/trading) here in Albion instead and yet actually have something exciting to spend the silver on (risking it in the Full Loot PVP).

These days I prefer single shard games. One shared world that everyone participates in is absolutely the way to go, and it's encouraging to see that this is exactly the direction Albion has taken. 

Another thing I loved about Eve was the ability to balance risk/reward. That also seems present in Albion. It has different zones each of which carries a different risk, from safe to full PVP. Naturally the materials increase in value with the more dangerous zones having the most to gain in them. You get to make choices about the level of risk you're comfortable with, and other people are naturally keen to take advantage if you let your greed get the better of you.

I absolutely love old school MMOs (I played Ultima Online back in the day) especially the full loot PVP mechanics. I would probably be still playing Eve Online were it not for the fact that new ships for that game geared towards my playstyle (fly cheap kill expensive) appeared only every half decade or so due to CCPs obsession with Faction and just generally expensive hardware. All the PVE in Eve was boring as sin, so there's that. The way I see it Albion being new, and having an enthusiasting Dev team means that we might actually get new content on a regular basis. And I'm quite excited about the prospect of a full loot MMO that's alive, fresh and actively being developed. 

Honestly for a while now I've been resigned to not having any full loot MMO worth playing and I'm ashamed to admit I kinda dismissed Albion as being too casual. Now that I've actually tried it, it's slowly proving me wrong. Proving that the more casual elements aren't at odds with its sandbox elements. Showing that there are still developers out there who know exactly how to deliver a solid old school style MMO.

I'm brand new, and I've not done anything of consequence in Albion yet, so these first impressions might change over time, but so far I'm already having an absolute blast and really positive about the future of this interesting niche MMO.",1526936338,1527139061,True,11,1,0.47154662013053894,2,True,False,False

This game is like you're playing a moba character in an EVE online universe but instead of being in space it's in a medieval fantasy landscape. There's black and red zones which are basically nullsec and low sec respectively. Then there's yellow- & blue zones that act like medium & high sec zones. Hell, there's even a website with a killboard where you can see details about PVP-kills.

In red/black zones killed players drop all of their items for the attacker(s). 

[h1]The character[/h1]
Your character has no level, instead each activity can be leveled up individually. If you want to be good at woodcutting you will need to do woodcutting to level it up. Eventually you can retrieve higher tier wood and make money selling it to crafters for example. 

The ablities you have are based off of what weapon you have, just like in a MOBA. You buy weapon X and abilities a, b & c become available. If you keep playing with the same weapon your skill level in that weapon increases and you unlock new abilities that you can replace a, b or c with. 

You basically play the game like you want to. You can play a healer in leather gear because of some weird synergy between the leather gear abilities and the abilities on a specific healer weapon for example. This makes your character feel unique compared to other players characters. It's not just a preset class chosen like in many other similar games.

[h1]Community[/h1]
The global chat should be turned off as soon as you get into the game. It's like reading the twitch-chat. Apart from that it's a very social game. Playing in a guild or in a group with friends is being actively encouraged. There's guild v guild battles over land in-game. There's alliances between guilds. Being in a guild have many perks such as providing a guild island where the guild can meet up, build different structures for different crafts and set their own usage fees. 

[h1]Update frequency / Developer activity[/h1]
The developers are active and keep updating the game for the better. I've seen a lot of old backers say otherwise but as a new player I find the game highly enjoyable and the planned changes seem good to me. 

[h1]Notes[/h1]
You will need to grind a lot of things in Albion Online and that might not be for everyone. I find it relaxing but I understand that some people just hate it and if they do they should not get into Albion Online for that very reason. Being a fully player run economy every little thing needs to be crafted or gathered by players. Be it you or somebody else. Early game gathering is quite boring due to there being no risk involved and a lot of competition around the limited resources. With that said things get more exciting when you move out of the starter areas and start grinding in PVP-enabled areas. You got to stay on your toes and be ready to run at the first sight of an enemy player.

Playing with friends is easy and since there's no character level it's quite easy to pick up the game and ""catch up"" to somebody who's been playing the game for a longer time. You bascially just need to reach the same zone as your friend after going through the initial hoops of learning the different tools. 

[h1]P2W?[/h1]
You can exchange gold (bought with real money) for silver which is the in-game currency and you can use gold to purchase cosmetic things or premium time. Premium gives you a bonus to the amount of fame (xp) that you get in the activities you perform. It basically helps you skill up faster. 

I would not call it P2W beause you can purchase this gold in-game with silver and purchase premium that way. Any items bought with the silver that you can get with gold will still be dropped if you get killed in a PVP enabled zone. 

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

Some things that everyone should know
- This game is NOT P2w. There is a sub, but what most of the reviews fail to mention is that if you join a guild, or play for a week or so, you can literally earn enough money in one day to buy an entire months sub with in game currency, as you can buy gold (premium currency) with silver (in game currency). 
- There is a lot of gathering, I personally find it very relaxing and put music on, but its not for everyone
- Player Island's are a really cool addition to the game, where you can customize your own island, farm for stuff, build materials, hire workers, and do a lot of cool stuff
- The first few hours in the game is not representative to the rest of the game, once I got T4 armor, which happened around 10 hours in, I was able to go on some really cool dungeons with my guild and had a lot of fun.
- The devs have a lot of updates coming, one including the Merlin update which helps revamp solo play and adds a new faction system, which everyone seems to be excited for.

Its very grind heavy, for what seems a rather lack lusture reward

Progression doesnt seem to be by means of a story driven objective(s), and more about collecting base materials to simply make a set of armour and a weapon, before moving on to the next higher level of the world map

Initially there are 6 or 7 quests, given out by some NPC's; go here, collect that, come back, go see this guy, pick up some other sh.it, come back, then it just seems to stop. You are left to your own devices, which ultimately means grinding for materials to make armour/weapons etc

Unfortunately, in order to progress in makng new higher tier items, you have to make the same tier items multiple times, then 'destroy' them by studying them at the vendor you just made them at.
Wouldnt be so bad, but this must be done for each tier of weapons / armour, and each tier requires different materials that you cna only achieve from the higher lareas of the map, and the quantity required to be 'studied' seems to increase exponentially

Ive played about 8 or 9 hours, and have grinded up to tier 3, journeyman items.
i'd guess it took me 2 hours to progress from beginer, to novice, then to journeyman
I can see it will take considerably more time to leave this tier 3 

There are 10 tiers

There are 'dungeons', i guess you can call them dungeons
But dont be confused they are not like WoW raids

I have only done a few that are completed by single player
Im at a loss as to what they are supposed to achieve, as they are small encampments which entail going in to a wine celler, killing 20 or so NPC's, then warping out. No boss or any reward except the few silver coins from each NPC
I see there are group recommended versions, maybe they are different
But i havent seen anyone rocking cool, individual items that would suggest boss loot drops

I'll probably play it on and off until the free premium runs out, after which it will likely become an insufferable grind, and i'll bin it
Im pretty certain this will likely be the case for most casual players as premium costs about $10 a month, or 2500 gold coins.

No real traditional quest lines outside tutorial that I've seen. Again, I like this, others may not.
Requires a level of self motivation to accomplish anything. LOVE this, others may want more hand holding.
VERY real consequences for making bad choices or doing something stupid. The tension is great, but not for everyone.
Real money to in game currency possible... It doesn't so much feel like pay to win as pay for advantage... most everything in the game is very player skill oriented...

It makes a nice market of people who will buy stuff I craft. Also allows me to buy game time for in game currency.

Closest game to this one I think in feel would be Eve Online, minus the spreadsheets, dropped into a fantasy setting. Same style of cut throat pvp, large and small scale. Same kind of economic warfare. Same kind of piracy/banditry...

I'm only T4 right now so I have a ways to go before I can provide an adequate review, but I'll say that so far it's been a lot of fun.  

This game can be grindy, but honestly it reminds me of a fantasy version of EvE.  EvE was very grindy but I loved it.  The sandbox economy really stands out to me.  The fact that NPCs run a black market buying player made gear and then selling that gear to other NPCs that you later kill and potentially find said player crafted gear on as a drop is pretty neat.

This game is a fee 2 play game coined by Jim Sterling.  $30 USD is the minimum entry fee but you can pay as much as $100 USD for the Legendary  Pack.  Yes, this game has multiple tiers you can buy into just like AAA games selling 'editions'.  Once purchased, there is a monthly subscription that 'speeds up' progression.  Currency can also be purchased with real world money.  Basically, its a full priced game (considering the severe lack of content) with microtransactions.

[b]Pay 2 Win[/b]
There are 2 currencies in Albion Online.  Gold is the currency that can be purchased with real world money.  Gold can be used to purchase 'cosmetics' and to purchase [i]silver[/i].  Silver is the 2nd currency and is used to purchase everything else in the game.

The reason Albion Online is pay to win is that players can purchase gold with real world money and TRADE the gold through the gold/silver market (its super easy and instant).  Players then can use the silver to buy power and skip the MASSIVE grind.

The devs try to defend this by saying the game itself doesn't allow a direct transfer of real world money into in-game currency, but its irrelevant.  The game is DESIGNED to facilitate pay 2 win in many ways.  I just think its really funny that the devs use bold face lies.  Who are they trying to fool here?

This game has a full loot system.  That means if your character is killed by another character, your body can be looted and you lose all the gear on you.  This means that in order to get back into the fight or to start playing the game again, players will need to 'grind' the materials to craft their gear, grind to get silver to re-purchase their gear, or you guessed it, use real world money to purchase gold to purchase silver to re-purchase their gear.  I think this is by far the worst system ever developed especially in a competitive multiplayer game (yes even worse than SW Battlefront's 2s progression system, at least when you die there, no-one can steal your star cards --- imagine that!!!).

Now, players can even BUY experience (fame) through the [url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/233789137?t=02h12m14s]Tome of Insight[/url].

Did I mention all gear has ware and tear?  Meaning, gear has a built-in timer in which the item will degrade over time and eventually break.  Once its broken, it cannot be fixed (trash).  Items can be repaired.  The more ware and tear, the HIGHER the silver cost to repair.  All things point to using silver to encourage players to use real world money.

[b]Cosmetics[/b]
[quote]There is a premium currency, gold, that can be used to buy vanity-only items or as an alternative to buy the premium status
[/quote] - [url=https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/38201-Albion-Online-Business-Model-Discussion/]url[/url]

Some cosmetic items can only be purchased with Gold.  This is another driving factor for people to insert more money into the game.  Some people will claim its 'ok' because players can grind for the silver to purchase the gold.  And of course, the best way to grind is to purchase 'premium' status which is the subscription.  And then the people will say, you can just grind to purchase premium.

If you followed that, you grind to purchase gold to purchase premium.  Then you use your premium during grinding (because it speeds up the grind) to purchase gold so that you can purchase cosmetic items.  Or you can just skip the grind and purchase cosmetics with real world money.

[b]Grind Fest[/b]
Albion Online is designed to be a grind OR to use real world money to skip the grind.  That's how these companies make money afterall.  Why is the game a grind?  Everything in game needs to be crafted.  Everything that is crafted comes from materials.  All materials must be gathered.  Gathering is the grind.  Gathering is not fun IMHO (some players claim grinding is fun; some people also may enjoy watching paint dry too).

How does gathering work?  

You walk into the world, click on a resource node, wait, then click on the gathered material to put it in your backpack.

That is the above process.  It sucks.  Its not fun.  Its a waste of time.  When your backpack is full, you go to town and either sell the materials or use the material to craft.

Rinse and Repeat.

Now if you have purchased gold with real world money, you can purchase silver on the exchange, go to any auction house and instantly purchase the materials OR gear you need.

[b]Daily Timers[/b]
If grinding wasn't bad enough, there is farming in this game. That is right, be prepared to plant some carrots and wait 22 hours to harvest.  Daily timers are yet another nail in the coffin of pay 2 win game design.  Daily Timers are NOT FUN.  Daily Timers are designed to keep the rats on the treadmill or for players to purchase gold in order to purchase the materials or crafted items from the daily timers essentially skipping the wait.  All game design points to exploiting players one way or another. 

[b]Pyramid Scheme[/b]
If this game hasn't employed enough dirty tricks, it pulls out all the stops for this one.  This game designed an 'invite' system.  Players first of all have to PURCHASE invites.  Invites grants new players 7 days of free play time.  If a player purchases the game, the player who sent the invite gets in game rewards some of which can ONLY be attained via the invite system.  Every month there is a new reward.  Its yet another way for people to use real world money in order to gain unattainable items otherwise.  The more players that sign up under your name, the more rewards you get.  Its just so dirty.

[b]Account Linking[/b]
Players who purchased the game outside of steam can NOT link their accounts.  This forces existing players to either purchase the game through steam and create a new account, or not use steam.  The developers claimed they would lose too much money from existing whales if they allowed the whales to transfer their accounts.  The developers are not happy about the steam tax but they certainly want the user base that steam provides.

[b]Banning Criticism[/b]
This developer has a history of banning valid criticism to the game.  I have posted my review on the forums and was banned.  They also deleted my forum post twice containing this information.

[b]Summary[/b]
Albion online is not fun.  It uses every exploitative trick to extract money out of its players except for loot boxes.  I would highly recommend players to stay away from this game.  The developers only want to exploit users for their money and do not want to actually provide a fun experience.  Stay away.",1526514757,1526945982,False,595,25,0.737882137298583984,0,True,False,False

Albion Online is rather divisive, but not exactly because of the reasons one may think. Many that dislike the game have played it in some capacity and often use  cheap shots like ""P2W"", ""Runescape but not good!"",  ""mindless grinding disguised as a sandbox!"". These are mostly partial truths designed to get a rise out of those who unconditionally support the game.

To a much larger degree, one which I feel is the core reason this game gets what seems to many as irrational hate is the team behind Albion.They're almost in 24/7 denial and/or damage control even before the game was formally released. Not liking something about the game and suggesting anything other than high praise is met with some questionable behavior. A friend of mine was permanantly banned from the game for asking for a refund because at the time, none of the footage reflected the actual product. This has since kind of changed. They're on par with your narcissist of a mother in law, they want to manipulate everyones perception of them by  manipulating those that have a perception that does not fit their narritive. 

Now I kind of get it, nobody wants to develop something and have it be returned or critiqued in a way that feels unfair. You're basically watching potential dollars,pesos,francs,euro fly away.

But man does the way a company handles itself reflect on peoples impression of the product. There were so many more people during beta. It wouldn't say its a ghost town now, but it barely feels like it once was.

[h1] The Good	[/h1]
The game's initial feel from the tutorial kinda gives trash vibes with how it's laid out but after playing for a couple of hours it kinda stopped holding my hand and became just a chill and fun game to play. I'm more of a life-skilling player when it comes to MMOs soo shit like Black Desert and Archeage pulled me in but couldn't hold me with somewhat high-ceiling endgame, soo I sat in casual limbo joining life-skilling guilds and trying to improve crafting to just sell items. Unlike the mentioned MMOs above, Albion Online seems to negate that somewhat with how simple it is on the surface and keeps semi-complex combat for people who love PVP and GVG stuff. 

[h1] The Questionable	[/h1]
PVE stuff soo far doesn't seem to be fleshed out but i personally can't fully say that YET because I'm not too far into PVE content to begin with. The world isn't very interesting beyond player interactions and there's not much context to why the world is soo untamed and why our character is at one of the continents in the world. hopefully my questions about PVE and the world will be answered as I play.


[h1]The Bad [/h1]
The UI and Progress bars in the game isn't well layed out and the lack of options and editing for UI makes the game less enjoyable for myself. As mentioned before, the ""tutorial"" is kinda lame and even after the game makes me feel like I'm on a god damn rail for a bit. If theres any much needed changes soo far, it would probably UI, Art and the Tutorial area.

Overall the game is suprisingly alright for a title that came out of the blue for me. hope theres gonna be major changes but even if they don't happen the game isn't bad at all for what it aims to do.

You really need to know what you're getting into before buying this though. This is a world that doesn't fuck about, you're given very little instruction then told to go off and do whatever you feel like. However what you feel like doing may place you in the crosshairs of another player if you enter a Red zone which is all but necessary at some points which is why guilds are essential.

Yes, you can lose everything and I mean EVERYTHING even the rewards that you got from the paid upgrade packs. In-fact if you enter a red zone wearing that gear or using those mounts you're painting a massive target on your back because those mounts sell for a LOT of silver.

This feels like the EVE Online of fantasy MMOs. Yes, it is very rough around the edges right now and feels like it needs more content but the developers seem to be VERY active engaging with the community, I'm always seeing moderators talking in chat which is a nice change of pace.

Despite the harshness of the world as well the game has a very chilled vibe to it, if you want to just kick back and farm for a few hours you can do that no problem with no real trouble from other players.

This is exactly the kind of game I've been trying to find for so many years now and it's so nice to see it being developed. I hope Albion does extremely well for itself, seriously. I want this game to grow. If you've ever loved an MMO with sandbox elements then you owe it to yourself to give Albion a try.

The game provides hours of addictive content but it does feel like a brain dead grind. The game feels rewarding when you play and progress which makes it seem as if you're not wasting your time. However, it would be understandable if people don't enjoy the game due to the hours of investment needed to get to 'late game' for example I've invested 40 hours since the release of albion on steam and I have only reached Tier 5. 
The game allows people to express who they are unlike in other MMORPGS since people can be anything from Miners to the strongest PvP players in the world of Albion.

If you're into that then you'll probably like progressing through the tiers and what not (as there's a lot to go through (like a lot a lot)). But sadly other than that I fear the game doesn't have much more to offer. 

Combat so far has been boring and repetative, the fact that you can change classes at will, first seemed cool; But it makes you quickly feel like there isn't much combat progression. 

A lot of the areas are duplicates of the previous ones with just higher tier buildings replacing the lower ones (yay for creativity).

Contrary to some of the other reviews the game neither runs poorly (i.e. I've not come across any framedrops or lag) nor is this game P2W. While you can buy 'gold' in game with $ and then use that to get silver or buy some other things (i.e. learning points - which are limited if you don't have premium and speed up learning of skills a little bit), you can buy a lot if not most of the things with the in game currency. The price might be little steep, but if you actually pay attention to market prices and what sells well in what region you can make a lot of money really quickly.

What else, graphics are okay at best (I played at max settings fyi), story and quests are pretty much non existant as it's a game where you set your own goals.

Lots of nice players though! I doubt I would have done my 11hrs if I didn't have few good laughs from the people in global.

The only enjoyable thing I found to do with this game is the ease of turning it off. Stop it. I don't mean it in that way, there's no hate here. Depending on how busy you are you can literally hop in and out of this game non stop without having to worry about anything. It was quite a nice change compared to the other MMOs I've played. Where it feels like I'm bound by something until I finish the quest or get to a certain location..

All in all, it's not a terrible game. I personally do not favour it. But that's not why I'm not recommending it. Simply put, compared to other MMOs out there this game is really lacking. Combat, economy, crafting, skill progression - there are games out there that do all of those better.

I'd personally would suggest getting it on a sale, a big sale - like 75% off sale, okay fine minimum 50% off.",1526819122,1526819122,False,193,5,0.807401776313781738,1,True,False,False

Be that becoming a top arena player, a great crafter, or some c**t who just ganks everyone and wants to see the world burn. A really nice game to just have a podcast in the background.

The thing that made me actually buy the game (there is a 7 day free trial you can get a key for on the official forums) is the ability to play it on my phone. Picking up right where you left off while waiting for the bus or something is so great, especially considering that sometimes I just don't have the time to sit down and play a game like this at home for an extended period of time.

I'll be honest, I am not a super fan of the full loot PvP aspect of the game, but that only happens in some areas, you can do a lot of the stuff in a ""safe"" area and not worry about getting ganked. Also crafting gear is pretty straightforward, so even if you lose everything it wont be too hard to bash one out.

As far as microtranactions go I will say that being able to buy silver is a bit dodgy in my opinion, but it steel beats most MMOs in that aspect. Probably the first time in years where a game is not bombarding me with a cash shop.

So yeah, in conclusion I will say that this is a fun game, a bit archaic in some aspects, but being able to play this on the go is quite amazing.",1526769700,1526769700,True,17,0,0.490660965442657471,0,True,False,False

First off, I don't believe this game to be ""pay to win"". The game is buy to play, and purchasing will supply you with 2,000 gold and 30 days premium game time. Beware though, as these rewards are *per character*, meaning if you activate the reward on one character, you can't acivate it on another. I do believe the premium status should apply to all characters, but it doesn't at the time of writing. Players can spend real money on gold, and convert this to silver. They can purchase premium time with either currency (and so a player who doesn't spend a penny can actually earn premium status, it may just take a while). Having given 30 days of premium and 2,000 gold with the standard game - you can decide whether or not premium is worth it; also start saving up that silver if you don't wish to spend any money. However it is quite cheap for those that don't mind spending a few quid.

Characters don't have classes, levels and such - you can choose between cloth, leather and plate gear at any time; even mixing them up is fine to create your own (almost) unique playstyle. 

The grind kicks in when you realise you have a skill tree for pretty much everything you do in game. If you want to craft items, you must have the required skill level for that specific item. If you want to gather the resources to craft such item - you must have the required skill level to gather them. This even applies for wearing armour, weapons, mounts and so on - you *must* have the required skill level in order to wear it.

Items in Albion Online have a tier from 1 to 8, the higher the tier, the higher the Item Power received from the item. Gear doesn't have stats like agility, intelect, strength etc - from what I can see - a weapon, for example has an Item Power and stats such as damage output. What is nice, though, is the option to choose a certain ability from items (weapon, head, chest and boots). Also, did I mention you must unlock certain abilities in the skill tree? Yep!

The combat is in a similar style to that of MOBAs, with just a few abilities determined by the gear you wear.

After just a few tutorial quests, which got me out into the open world pretty quickly, I noticed that quests just vanish. You have all the freedom you want. You will spend a lot of it gathering, killing and crafting to improve your average item power and earn silver.

There's a lot more such as player islands (private instances), guild controlled territory, full loot upon death... Most of which I still need to try myself! Enjoy.",1526759965,1526759965,True,36,1,0.650547266006469727,0,True,False,False

This game has caught my attention so greatly i have dumped all other games like ESO , BDO and many others i will not play them no more cause this game has captured the perfect play of a MMO with the simplicity and great attention to detail when it comes to its complexitiy as well .

 Player island , housing , guild housing , guild islands and even conquering guild cities , towns for guilds . the game has so much to offer and such rich detail in what is there when it comes to crafting , mining or gathering any resource for that matter . 

 100% recommend this game to anyone that likes pve mmos or even pvp mmos cause it has both . You can play pve and never have nothing to worry about or if you like pvp there is alot of that to handle too if that is your thing .

1) You don't have a story-/questline to follow / that takes you by the hand, rather you make your own story by doing what you want to get better in.
2) If you want to play only for killing Mobs (and even more so if you don't want to join a group/guild *at all*) Albion Online will probably not satisfy you (unless you learn to like other stuff).
3) The game is B2P and premium is optional, you can purchase premium without paying IRL money. While there is a P2W debate, I can assure you that there won't be anyone OP due to paying money - most that you can buy with money is acceleration to what you get by normally playing the game.
4) You can try out the game by grabbing a trial key in the forums / on reddit / on someones stream / etc - you register then on the homepage and enter the trial key, when you want to buy the game on steam you can continue the trial character by using the same email then as on the trial account. (Doesn't work with regular account that bought the pack already!)
5) Be aware that people can be jerks and scamming, betrayal, espionage etc is part of the game and will not be punished.

Its not like your typical fps where somebody kills you 5 seconds later after going into cover its not that dumb lag compensation wank.

Graphic nice clean simplistic

Has Day and night cycle.. ooh wow.. but its nice to have actually looks good at day and good at night :)

UI nice in 21:9 scale with screen so it not in the center which is nice. Chat box is at the side out of the way which means its not distracting me or annoying me. 

It run  really well so far at ultra i get like 200fps at 200fps limit i put down to 120 because i dont need 200fps to hit tree and stuff

Bought it on sale at just under £15 worth it.. at full price it will be £22 pretty much and it will still be worth it.

The game is massive

yes very big very populated mmo.

Proper mmo not hey there is 5 people in an instance It MMO no it not that stupid kinda game its like.. hey man there be like 50 people in this town area bit and then you go out and there loads

Themes nice like the setting the design of the woods feels like an actual kinda place weird to explain but  it nice design so far :)

Its mostly easy to learn and grasp after a couple crafting and stuff you pretty much good to go.. Just follow the quest thing talk to people and ask in help section if you need any help.
99% of the player base so far is friendly from what i've seen there isn't really any toxicity its kinda weird.  

Its pretty much a full living breathing world players are every where in all zones i've been to doing their own thing helping and talking to others while they do stuff.

It feels like a proper alive mmo not one of those dead ones with a quest area that just goes dead because people done quest and the area becomes kinda a pointless non relevant place

Imagine Eve Online meets runescape, without quests.

I would recommend its one of the better mmos.. Definately become my main mmo now

They have a destiny board (in the shape of a wheel) which looks like a branching skill tree, but I look at it as achievements which unlock higher tiers of things to do or equip.

There is this NPC that needs help at the time of this review, but I'm too hooked on improving my tools for gathering and refining materials to make myself able to gather better things so I can be an Elder gatherer or whatever else I aim for.

The combat is slotted to your QWER keys.  F is Sprint faster (movement speed seems slow, but I got over it).

Don't think about the graphics, you're not getting realism here.  They are making this cross platform with mobile, so look at it as if you're playing it on mobile and keep the expectations on details at that level.

Beyond the tutorial pretty much everything was fairly inuitive, there is a single quest at the beginning of the game that gives you a little run around and then rewards you with a horse at right about the time you feel like you need one. The combat system is very smooth and almost feels like a ""create your own hero"" moba and I enjoy the way that most everything seems to be crafted by players. Very good first impression for me. 


Other things to note. 
Good- 
1. Gold, and therefor anything you can buy with gold up to and including premium time, can be bought with silver. There is a fluxuating exchange rate, but based on what I've seen it's fairly reasonable, at least at the moment. A few minutes of gathering can net you a small handful of gold if the right city. 

2. Although your offensive and defensive abilities being tied to your weapons and armor can look a little restricting at first, it seems to open up as you gain access to higher level equipment that provide multiple choices for the same slot.

3. Gathering is pretty simple. Just find what you want, click it and it gets added to your bag automatically. Better tools will gather lower quality mats faster, and if you can't gather something the game will tell you exactly what tool or trait you need to unlock. 

4. No traditional ""levels"". Most of your power seems tied to your equipment, and you unlock the ability to use higher level equipment by using the lower level versions of it. This creates a very elder scrolls-esque progression system where you get better at doing specific tasts by practicing those tasks. 

5. Freedom. Since there is only one quest at the very beginning of the game, passed that point the game leaves you to wander wherever you want. 

6. Will run pretty smooth on low end systems. Pretty self explanitory but my laptop is basically a potato and can run the game great. 
----------------------------------------------
Can go either way depending on the reader: 

1. Grind. If you're not someone who can tune out and relax while mindlessly grinding this game might not be for you. Since progression is tied to practice, it can take a while to build up to some of the higher skills. There are ways to skip the grind, but the game DOES still require you to completely around 20% of the progression bar before it will allow you to complete a skill, and not every skill can be skipped this way. Some of the most important skills, like unlocking faster mounts, bigger bags, and the damage bonuses against higher tier enemies require you to 0-100% them. 

2. No direction. For someone who likes to explore this can be amazing. If you're someone who gets lost easily and wants to do next you're not going to have a good time without friends to help guide you. While most things are fairly intuitive(at least for me), the game doesn't tell you what to do next at any point beyond that first quest. 

3. Art style. I personally find the games simplistic, cell shaded art style to be beautiful but not everyone is going to get the same enjoyment out of this that I do
-------------------------

Cons: 

1. There are some things the game flat out doesn't tell you. For example, where to go to buy property/islands, and when you're constructing buildings, I couldn't get it to tell me what kind of materials I actually needed directly. I COULD figure it out by looking at the number in the materials cornet to figure out that, for example the basic house wants tier 2 stone blocks, but then I had to try to look up what those were if I didn't have the material tiers already memorized when I started. 

2. Can't change the camera. This isn't a big one. The fixed camera works for what the game is but some people might not like this. You can zoom in and out but that is about it.",1526560108,1526560375,True,18,2,0.558875024318695068,0,True,False,False

PvP is looked down upon in yellow and red zones, and gaining a negative rep has no redeemable qualities. It takes weeks, if not months to reverse what rep damage you can do in a single day. They had an opportunity to create pirate cities where criminals had to spawn and live out of and form their own ecosystem. A bounty system, if developed correctly could add meaning to the reputation system. 

Beta 1 felt so much different than the current state and direction. It was raw and pure, and now it's gone for better or worse.

The game has potential, but it feels very much like playing a beta - or even alpha.

Much of the problem is that the game world consists of nothing but resource nodes and players. There is no loot, no chests, and nothing interesting to discover anywhere. The entire game consists of you gathering resources to craft EVERYTHING.
There are several games where you are supposed to craft everything yourself. However, those games don't have long dungeons with coins as the only reward, they will have chests with already crafted items, some kind of events, etc.


1: The game is VERY much based on farming\grinding. 
To get better gear you need to create it yourself. To create better gear you need to learn new recipes. To learn new recipes you will have to grind old recipes first. To grind old recipes you will have to grind resources nodes.
To put it short, you required to play this game a LOT to get much fun out of it.
There are no new rewards ""just around the corner"", like most games have.

2: There are barely any rewards at all for doing anything at all in this game.
- Why would anyone care to do an ""expedition"" (kind of dungeon) when the only reward is common coins?? 
- Worse yet, the common dungeons seem to have no kind of reward AT ALL, no coins, no chests, no items, nothing!
- Why would anyone care to explore the world, when there is nothing interesting to find anywhere??
- Why should I care to fight enemies that only drop common coins, where's the fun in that??
This feels so meaningless I can hardly belive it's supposed too be a finished game.

I also feel there is too limited ingame information and toolips. 
- I forget all the time what I need to create that item at the public workshop, and I can't find any way to figure it out without running back all the way - and there is no fast travel.
- We have gold coins and silver coins, but I have no idea what the gold coins are for.
- We can craft various buildings, but I find NO ingame information and what they do, how they are used or anything. I don't want to invest a ton of resources and then find out I made something I don't need, or placed it at a bad spot!
- We gain fame for everything we do, but I have no clue what the heck fame IS. What is it for? Why do I gain fame? Do I have any reason to care how much fame I have?

The character movement also feels pretty unintelligent, it's like playing a game from the 90's: The character wil go directly in the clicked direction, trying to ignore any kind of obstacles.

So why didn't I ask for a refund? Mostly because it takes more than 2 hours to get to know this game. 
I was hoping to find more, and I hope the devs will add some serious content in the future... but statistically that is not likely.
I have a hard time beliving the game is really this shallow and empty.
The game would be so much more fun and make so much more sense if you could actually find some chests, premade items and other stuff around the world.",1526548784,1526549001,False,31,1,0.531677544116973877,0,True,False,False

It feels like a crossover between the MMOs Ryzom and Eve Online.

Gathering is mildly grindy, but the grind feels meditative. There are many things you can do in-game while listening to an audiobook or watching some Netflix for example. It's not an idle game by a long shot, but most activities are very gentle.

The freedom takes some getting used to. There's a short set of tutorial missions, but it doesn't really take you by your hand from zone to zone while leveling. You can focus on deepening any skill you like, you can travel in any direction you like. You can spend hours trading & ferrying goods between cities, but there's also content for those who want to cast spells and swing swords.

I have to create a new account because the developer does not allow linking existing ones to Steam, forcing longtime players who prefer their games and achievements in one place to rebuy the game. On beta I was an independent crafter/trader and made it into top-100 fame. On release I was playing open world in a top guild - among other things we were holding the capital of the world, Caerleon for more than a month, until almost everyone in the guild (that was getting ready for the release for more than a year) quit due to bad design decisions and pure technical incompetence demonstrated by the developer time and time again. 


I can't name all of those as I don't have all week, but some of them I can't help mentioning. For some of them I have even found proofs, that are quite hilarious if you're not attached to the game. Let's start: 

Almost everything in the game can be directly or indirectly purchased with real money in the game (not talking about shady 3rd party rwt sites). They even added an item called Tome of Insight quite recently to make sure you can now buy even combat experience (fame).

Game handles big fights poorly. Lags, freezes, etc. Server issue unaffected by performance of your machine. This would not be critical if the game didn't force guilds and alliances into massive fights via objective design. People would build for lagfests (huge non-target AOEs, instacasts etc). Big fights were unplayable at release (summer 2017), and I heard claims that this improved. However, here is a link from December 2017, so you be the judge of that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYyxG894sUU

Sometimes two tooltips would show different values of the same thing and you are left to guess which one is correct, have fun minmaxing your build for that hardcore pvp experience! Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/albiononline/comments/74b1dv/lesson_kids_when_you_use_different_decimal_places/

Level scaling is broken with some items. A problem developers were aware of before release. Unfixed for almost a year. Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/albiononline/comments/8jfuwa/why_is_this_a_thing/

Right before release developers decided to funnell all the players who wanted o participate in black zone content through a single city, Caerleon. Naturally it decimated the population in all the other cities and turned trading and economy strategy into a spreadsheet simulator. Networking and socializing helped independent crafters/traders a lot in the betas, but not now, when everyone is forced into one city.

At release that city became overpopulated to the point when it was hardly playable, and sometimes wouldn't even allow someone to enter the city. The solution was to make all other players invisible if there's more than x people in the city, which was always. So it looked like a ghost town all the time. Furthermore, the solution rendered all other players invisible... including those who were fighting in a control over the city in a 20v20 GvG. I wouldn't believe it either, so here's the video of a fight for the capital of the world in a hardcore pvp game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj40giQpbyY 

Some of your ""instacast"" abilities can be interrupted.

Most if not all open world dungeons are copy-paste.

Addition of ""expeditions"" AKA safe way to farm fame in an instanced dungeon with no pvp.


I should also mention some of the actions by the company itself:

Censorship. Even the subreddit for the game is moderated by a company employee who refuses to stand down despite reddiquette clearly speaking against people with financial ties to the thing being mods on subreddits for the thing. Open letter asking to give mod power to the community is within top 10 all time posts on the subreddit.

Endorsing a doxxer, swept under the rug when realized that, never acknowledged or apologised.

Pushing neverending ""referral seasons"" with cool mounts exclusive to people who sell their game instead of players who are good at their game.

Baiting early supporters into buying packs with promises of headstart. Come release everyone with the same amount of money got the same treatment.

Removing the bottom part of leaderboards that demonstrated that the population was falling.

iOS version still not delivered, although it was promised way before the release. People who planned to pvp on computers in the evenings and farm/craft/trade during daytime commute/work breaks on their iOS devices got royally screwed by this cross-platform game.


The community during beta had some of the worst people I've ever met ever, but also some of the nicest ones. Since then the group who had enough self-respect to not tolerate this level of incompetence and attitude from the developers mostly left and the other one mostly stayed, you can guess who left and who stayed.


This game had unprecedented potential, but as of now I don't think it can be recommended. Hardcore players would be turned off by technical flaws and inconsistencies that can cost your guild weeks of progress. Casual players are likely to enjoy this a great deal for a while before they realize that for significant further progress you'd need to join an autoritarian guild and become a cog in the machine. 

If you are still willing to try the game out I highly recommend asking for a trial key on the subreddit for the game. Normally you would just go to the official website for a limited trial, but not here - in this game an existing player has to buy the trial key and share it with you.
