Some maps are even re-used repeatedly, but even the unique ones aren't very good. Turn-based pretty much breaks the game and makes it so trivial it feels like cheating, making rtwp the mode of choice, but their implementation of rtwp is the laziest and most boring I've ever seen in any RPG.

+ The world's lore is good
+ Characters are mostly interesting
+ When leaving an area the game prompts you to grab any items you left behind- available right from the menu 

-Changing the party you're travelling with takes an obscene amount of time. This time it would take 6 days just to go into a location alone
- You find and can carry around a lot of food, including meat from killed monsters like deer, and yet these don't count as rations and you're still required to 'hunt' to camp which takes hours
- It doesnt make sense to begin without a map, or at level 1 as these characters, and the game would have been a lot better if it wasn't so. 
- Flavourtext and tooltips constantly show the wrong gender- why they didn't use gender neutral terms to make it easier on themselves is anyones guess
- Cutscenes and images constantly show my female character as a bearded man
- I've been hit through walls and bookcases with ranged attacks
- Stealth is finnicky and often before i fire off a bow shot, i've been spotted by a randomly patrolling group and they get first move for some reason 
- I've seen 6+ rounds go by with neither side landing an attack even with masterwork and finesse talents and +3 dex 
- The decisions of which dialogue gets voice read and which doesn't seems to be entirely at random and misses core character conversations
- You walk so slowly, especially if you're the least bit encumbered 
- Inventory size tied to strength so if you're not a melee character you'll be at a disadvantage there 
- There seems to be no way to show actual numbers for enemy hit points, resulting in round after round of hitting an enemy who already looks like they should've been dead a while ago. When changing to text instead of HP bar it literally says ""Dead"" on living enemies. This is an ability they can have- but that is never explained anywhere
- Its not made clear which missions advance time and which don't. I stopped along the way to do something and suddenly another mission said it was advanced and locked out 
- Tooltips show text even for future levels resulting in huge walls of text when a sentence would convey the information far better
- You can't set it to not zoom to your characters on your turn but still zoom to enemies for theirs
- Camera moves to knocked out characters for their ""turn"" and just sits there for a second before moving on, even though nothing happens
- Theres no hit chance preview, you can only see the odds after you make the shot, and even thats hidden in the chat logs
- no easy way to check what a character has while equipped so have to completely backout and reset a level up whenever you need to check something
- Characters in battle will say they can attack a target, but when you execute the move they just run up and their turn ends
- they pull the ""hey this enemies gonna disappear and show up later"" trick way too often
- Very stupidly, traps can proc multiple times, including the web trap, resulting in me watching my party to fail infinitely in a row and being unable to move at all. Riveting gameplay.
- Enemies who can fear you every turn, and silly fear rules that aren't related at all to if you're winning, or high your hp is, or anything grounded in any way, and is ridiculous to the point of my characters wandering across an entire map while under its effects
- Tells you when you've been to an area, but not when you've cleared it which is awful as the game has many out of place high level enemies you'll probably need to come back to
- Dialogue options and in game events aren't tied to what you've uncovered, or who you're talked to, they're governed by pure RNG which cheapens the experience to no end
- enemies that knock you down with every single hit
- terrible auto save system. Why is there no option to save after every battle?
- your characters can fully die from walking through a bush
- Theres no sort inventory by price/weight efficiency option
- The discovery range for perception is per character and the range isnt large so sometimes you have to make sure you micro your party over every inch so they dont miss something 10 feet away from them
- The amount of rolls can get obscene sometimes. Some chests require a perception check to reveal, a trickery check to disarm, and another to lockpick. All of which can't be redone once failed.
- Resting can somehow take a full day
- conversations seem to sometimes only exist to prevent sneak attacks and hide convoluted plot bullshit. An enemy full heals in conversation because theyre a troll with regen, even though i only chose 1 dialogue option that was ""die, even while inflicted with acid",1708225557,1708997036,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am selecting the Recommended status, but I need to elaborate why this game has been so hard to get in to for me - which I suspect may very well apply to you as well.

Here we go: 

1. Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3) has ruined other games for you. 

For starters, if you have recently played BG3 and/or now suffer from the high bar BG3 has afflicted across the gaming industry... you most likely won't enjoy this. I totally understand too! I had to truly take a break from this genre and from BG3 for rough ~2 months before actually getting hooked on Kingmaker this 5th attempt. 

2. You don't like classic Computer Role-Playing Games (CRPG).

While we all love cinematic cutscenes galore and 100% full voiced games, this is not what you'll find here. I say again, if this is your norm - you'll likely struggle here. You actually have to read in this game, which for some people is unenjoyable. 

Games like Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2, Divinity Original Sin 1 & 2, ... you know, the classic and super well known CRPG's... if you can't really enjoy and/or get into these types of games... Kingmaker is most likely not for you. 

3. The beginning of this game is brutal. 

If you quit DoS2 before you left Fort Joy, this game is not for you. Kingmaker not only introduces an unfamiliar combat/game play system, with a very overwhelming character creation intro, it is brutally difficult... unless you are running Story Mode or what not. 

[BREAK] 

However! If you 1) Do not compare this to BG3, you 2) are open to a 50/50 split of reading and voice dialog mix, and 3) you enjoy challenge, complexity, and can make it past the first ~2 hours or so of the game...

I think you will find that Kingmaker is a damn good CRPG worth playing. 

I am only ~5 hours in of this current play through, so I may update this review accordingly when I actually finish the game. It has finally won me over and I am totally pulled in and having a blast. 

If you've suffered from the 1-3 debuffs listed above, you may need to do a full rest and then try this game again one more time.",1700416295,1708807363,True,0,0,0.475091785192489624,1,True,False,False

Overall, I’ll recommend it only because for the sale price you get a ridiculous amount of content, at least 100 hours of content, much more if you’re a completionist or taking it slow for just one playthrough.
However, the sheer mass of a game can actually become a con as you progress. Finishing the game felt more like a grind than a fun experience. I enjoyed the story. I liked the companions and their quests. The combat has a learning curve but was interesting in the beginning. But for me, without the use of guides and Bag of Tricks (cheat mod on Nexus) then I would’ve rage quit much sooner. Probably the chapter after Troll Trouble. I used it to skip combat (fights got tedious after so many times), auto complete kingdom quests (managing BP, crisis points, and saves got tedious), adjust romance counters (picking right speech options got tedious), and adding everyone to my party to get all the companion dialogue during a quest. You’d miss out on funny or insightful commentary during decisions or resting. That still didn’t prevent me from needing to constantly click Skip Day just to move along the story in-between chapters.
It has so much in the way of game mechanics, events, locations, just “stuff” that feels more churned out than handcrafted just for the sake of adding content. Not all of it is explained well, if at all. Not all of it makes sense. Not all of it I feel needs to be included. I had to do a lot of reading while playing just to understand how magic and resting works, how feats and items work, and how to unstuck myself during various quests. I didn't even understand metamagic when I finished but I was over reading and just wanted to finish the game.
 I feel that if many portions were cut or simplified, then it would reduce the game time by a quarter and make it much more enjoyable for people. Pathfinder: Kingmaker is… a lot.

But that being said I wasnt hooked by the story and I honestly didnt feel like learning the ins and outs of a new game and combat system and was hoping those two things were more engaging and streamlined.

There are a lot of minor ways that this game could've been better. The developers didn’t give this game the love that they should have. There are many immersion breaking things:

- Sometimes the bones left behind by a human are a ribcage belonging to something the size of a cow. That was immersion breaking.

- enemies will sometimes explode, leaving only blood and bones behind after only being hit with a crossbow bolt. That was immersion breaking.

- items don't get automatically moved to the top of your inventory. i.e. after you've closed/reopened it. That would be a quality of life improvement/time saver for the player.

- the description for the Elven race, given during character creation is lacking, making it harder to figure out how an elf would be role played. i.e. the description mentions something about the traditions of Elves, (shaping them - or something to that effect) but it reveals nothing about their traditions. There is also no information about their common religious beliefs, or iirc, their view of other races (there is more information about elves in-game in the encyclopedia, seen after you create a character… I can see someone being hesitant to create an Elf character due to this.

- there is no portrait for a male Elf spell caster in the character creation (for the player character or mercenaries) in the base game (a DLC adds 1). Elves make great spell casters, so they should've included a portrait for an elf spell caster (wizard or sorcerer) to make this a complete game.

- sometimes you see Harrim talking in the dialogue window in the intro long before you get near him. (perhaps this only occurs if you are loading a saved game in that area)

- in the cut scene with the forest Nymph, your companions are all sleeping on top of their bed sheets.

- the description for some items, mentions that a merchant would pay well for it (which isn't always the case). The description made me think that I would make a lot off of an item. Then I was disappointed when I saw the item price.

- the first time I played this, I wasn't able to get a treasurer, even for a long time into the game. (perhaps this has been fixed now). You could get a treasurer if you happened across a character/location at the right time. Realistically, after you've been running a barony/settlements for many months, you would be able to have at least 1 candidate for the position.

- the in-game old map of Avistan found as loot (it's sellable) only shows a tiny picture and there are no place names on it.

- the map to choose where to establish a settlement didn't show roads (perhaps this has been fixed by now)

- at least some low level buff spells don't start on the hotbar. i.e. belonging to Harrim.

- characters heal some when they level up. That is unrealistic.

- you see your party members drinking from a flask from time to time when they are idle. Yet you don't see any of the flasks (6 if you have a full party) in your inventory and therefore their weight isn't a factor.

- the mercenary system is unrealistic. One cost 2000 in the early game (a lower level mercenary) and you can keep him forever for that 1 time fee of 2000 even though his skills/ability improve. When you hire later mercenaries they cost a lot more (since they have better skill. A level 2 mercenary was 2000 iirc and 4500 at level 3). It would be more realistic if they were paid an amount per week or month, where the amount would go up the higher level/skilled the mercenary was.

- when you choose a portrait (for the player character or a mercenary that you hire) the character you are given after doesn't resemble the 1 in the portrait and therefore you need to spend time to try to make him look as similar as possible if you desire him that way (many probably would)

- you can camp without rations/camping supplies and when you do, you see bedrolls. There is also a bedroll and backpack seen in the character picture in the inventory screen (for some characters) and yet the weight of those items isn't shown as a factor.

- a mercenary in my party was seen with a dagger in his hand (an idle animation) yet there was no dagger in my inventory. (not in the shared party inventory either)

I got to the end of chapter 3 ([spoiler]Season of Bloom[/spoiler]), and I completed every side quest up to that point, then stopped playing when I realised almost everything I did in the game felt like a chore and I had been bored most of the way through.

[b][u]TL;DR[/u][/b]: I liked the premise, I liked kingdom management, and I liked exploration. On the other hand, character creation and levelling up are a confusing mess, combat is boring and there's too much of it, characters are forgettable, quests are boring, overall writing is below average.

To start with the positives: I liked the premise: an RPG where you also build and manage your domain. It harkens back to early editions of pen-and-paper D&D. I think it's a unique concept in the video game space, where the only other examples I can think of are Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (which came out after Kingmaker) and Dragon Age: Inquisition, though that one's a bit of a stretch. I also liked exploring the overworld map, though I would have liked if I could make my own roads along the way. And finally, unlike seemingly most people I really enjoyed kingdom management. It was rather simplistic, but I thought it was very good at what it was doing. That's all.

Now for what I didn't like: Character creation and character advancement for someone not familiar with the Pathfinder 1e system, is an intimidating and confusing mess. Too many classes, too many feats, too many fiddly abilities and passive effects that do next to nothing on their own and must be combined with 4 other abilities/effects to have a noticeable impact. The feat recommendation system is nice at first, but after some levels it starts recommending nonsensical options, e.g. a feat that enhances ranged attacks for a character who has 3 greatsword-specific feats and only ever uses a greatsword.

Combat - the main meat of the game - is boring. I played in turn-based mode and occasionally switched over to real-time-with-pause to deal with small random encounters. Most of the time you do the exact same thing every fight. Utility casters cast the exact same buffs, other casters use the same damaging spells, and most martial classes don't have much in the way of abilities, so they just hit things. There are far too many random encounters and other trash combat encounters whose only purpose is to have more samey boring combat.

The writing also leaves a lot to be desired. The characters are uninteresting and forgettable, and their dialogue is overwritten - they waffle on for eternity about little things, and they often say the same things, but worded differently. There are twists that you see far in advance that logically you should easily be able to prevent , but you can't. There are segments that are handled kind of like a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game that, especially after big fights, are incredibly anticlimactic. In addition, the majority of the quests are just boring and menial.

The game also just doesn't respect some of your choices. A character ([spoiler]Nok-Nok, a goblin[/spoiler]) wants to join your party. You say ""no"" because of a prior conversation, and they join anyway. Seemingly the only way to prevent them joining your party is to choose a Chaotic Evil option and kill them on the spot.",1707661032,1707661032,False,2,0,0.512258052825927734,0,True,False,False

The adaptation of the Pathfinder 1E ruleset took some time to get into. Playing on Normal difficulty preset, I finished the game without following the build guides.
There's a decent amount of criticism for this game online, but it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game. 

The kingdom management could use better guidance, especially around the kingdom stats, claiming territories, and leveling up the advisors. The events are fine, with some funny resolutions, like the one where the Grand Diplomat is mocked due to a failure when dressing the table for some guests. However, some take 60 or even 90 days, like those studying curses. I played with the Normal Kingdom difficulty until the Pitax Chapter. When the events destroyed my stats, I accepted the option that prevented kingdom failure and dropped the management difficulty to Effortless(not auto). Also, in chapters 5 and 6, there was much time to spend upgrading the kingdom since I completed most of the side quests.

The variety of choices looks overwhelming, especially when trying to figure out how to counter certain debuffs and effects that enemies apply to your party. That being said, the possibilities for character builds are huge — dozens of classes with multiple archetypes, feats, spells, items, etc.

Closer to the endgame, the pre-buffing became a regular activity. Half a dozen buffs for the party make a massive difference in combat, even though they take a minute or two to apply. Thankfully, the duration of many of those is tied to the class level, so by the end, it's enough to buff one time for 5-10 big fights.

The companions were all memorable, and I enjoyed completing their respective quests. Jubilost, Jaethal, Harrim, Octavia & Reg, and the tiefling girls are the ones that I enjoyed the most, yet others are great too.

Among the DLC, I've completed the ones that are part of the main campaign - the tiefling companion and Tenebrous Depths. Both are memorable, especially the endings to them. For the Depths, I've made a paladin hireling for their Bless Weapon buff, which I discovered by leveling Tristian.

However there are some incredibly frustrating elements that seriously lower the overall quality of the game:
First is still the myriad of combat bugs still in the game.
When your cursor clicks through an enemy when you want to attack them, making your ranged character sprint through the combat to end up behind the enemy you wanted them to attack, usually dying in the process.

Often the UI will let you know that something is possible until you actually attempt to do it - which then locks you out of other actions without actually doing anything.

The janky combat movement such as letting you move half your movement and still attack - unless you attack first in which case you can only move a measly 5ft instead of your normal 30 for the exact same actions in your turn just in a different order. 

Many doorways that you cant move through when youre a certain size when youre in combat - but are perfectly fine to move through outside of combat.

The summoned creature AI that will, instead of attacking the enemy theyre in melee range of, run past them (often provoking an attack of opportunity and dying to it), and wasting attacks/movement in the process and at times leaving your backline entirely vulnerable. There seems to be little logic behind the summoned creatures attacks, simply a random roll or something equally poorly implemented.

Sneak attacks seem to be somewhat RNG, i had a fight where a lone goblin in the middle of my seven man party - who i had clearly underestimated - sneak attacked my caster main character for 1.5x their entire health pool in one turn, where previously they were hitting for at most 10% of my health. There was no indication this was going to happen, he wasnt invisible or stealthed, just wandered straight up to me and stabbed me to death as if none of the rest of my team was there. There's also a balance issue with sneak attacks, if you get them to go off youll gib a boss in one round of fighting, often quite easily, but if you dont you'll struggle to take 5% of their health... not well designed.

Often your characters will get more swings/attacks than are required to take out an enemy, but you cant take these separately, even though you get enough movement to do so during your turn if you move before/after your attacks. Alternatively, if you do get these extra attacks (i.e. a ranged character), the attacks will just auto-target the next closest enemy with no way of choosing who to attack next, often just wasting extra attacks on a tank. Then theres parts like bomb throwing, where extra bomb throws during your turn are entirely wasted (wont even use) if the primary target dies during your attacks. I've had targets die to my first bomb in a series of 3-4 and your character just stands there not knowing what to do.

Then the actual intended gameplay is pretty awful at times.

RNG rules, some fights it will be on your side and it feels easy, other times your main character gets oneshot by a random arrow crit from someone shooting out of vision range, or when you attempt to cast a spell from where you believe youre out of opportunity attack range (which gives no indication on attack/spellcast). 

The formations that reset every time you need to leave a certain zone, so sometimes your mage will be at the front of your formation without having actually changed anything. Formations are also so small that you really have to move characters indivually if you want any real positioning, as even at max distances, your ranged characters will still be so close to the fight as to get gibbed on turn one without being able to move if the RNG gods are against you.

The spell balance/explanations, sometimes enemies that are immune to a spell will let you know by stopping you casting the spell on them, other times it'll just say 'immune' in the combat log and waste your turn. Many spells are entirely useless outside of very niche situations, and choosing the wrong spells for many classes is not something you can change, so a new player will get incredibly frustrated simply learning which spells are useless and which are worthwhile. 

Enemies often have incredibly illogical immunities or saving throws, like giants with faster reflexes than goblins, which leaves you essentially just guessing as to which spells will actually work on most enemies - especially as the 'gather enemy information' feature is dependent on skill character skill checks - so for a new player or one who doesnt want to just use google to look up the information youre entirely left in the dark until you fight an enemy multiple times. 

The real time combat is poorly designed, with AI being terrible, your caster (who wants to be using a staff because it gives them the right stat boosts) will often cast a spell then automatically run into melee combat. It's not an easy find to work out how to stop this.

There are skill checks, such as perception and lockpicking, that only give one attempt before locking you out of attempting again.. why do we not have a search room function, the main resource of the game is time, make failing a perception roll use time up if you want to attempt it again.. same with lockpicking, why does my character failing once just refuse to try to pick it again.. two really missed opportunities here to simply use up time instead and stop the need for save scumming constantly. It's also extra bad as many perception checks you simply wont know if they have worked or not, it doesnt tell you that youve missed a secret door, so you have no way of knowing unless you look it up - and sometimes quest items or items you need for collections are behind these invisible perception checks.

There are also many easily missed aspects of the game, my first playthrough i entirely missed multiple companions because they showed up in a zone i had already cleared previously, but there's no indication this is happening, and many of these characters are incredibly important to the party and your kingdom. Especially as some characters are really quite weak, but others are really strong.

The kingdom management also leaves much to be desired.

Many aspects are simply not explained, such as unrest, how it is affected, which things will change it etc... and the advisors skill scores going up as you improve the stat they're looking after, which stats you need to improve on an advisor to improve their success chances, or that many of your allies can only go into verrry specific advisor positions, sometimes leaving you without anyone in that advisor position during certain parts of the story, despite having an entire kingdom of citizens to choose from.. and then the mercenaries you can recruit into different advisor positions get an arbitrary negative modifier on being an advisor, and you lose a lot of the choice during events when using a mercenary (also not explained).

A very good question and I bought this game just because I ran out of D&D isometric games. I absolutely love Baldur's Gate 1/2  and tried Pillars of Eternity but never managed to finish it (shame on me).
This one, I managed to complete and enjoyed it a lot more than Pillars of Eternity. Its style is closer to Pillars of Eternity but it has lots of small things that makes it more enjoyable to play (and kick boredom away).

First of all, Pathfinder is more or less like D&D 3.5 so if you are familiar with those rules (""almost like Neverwinter Nights 1 and same as Neverwinter Nights 2), you are treading familiar terrains regarding the rules. It's very very dense though, and requires lots of min-maxing if you want to be ubergod.
For people who don't care, you can fully enjoy the game playing with a very well designed system to customize the difficulty. It can be good for people who just want to roflstomp enemies or those who really really want to be challenged and approach it as a puzzle/chess/tactical game.
Speaking of chess, you can switch anytime between turn-based and real time with pause which is another neat bonus to have. You can even switch in the middle of a battle.
I'll admit that I tried first the turn-based but after getting EACH BLOODY TIME in a long, click click combat against kobolds, centipedes and lowly monsters, it was getting very repetitive and boring. Turn-based would have been nice if there weren't so many cluster of enemies roaming around and it seems sometimes it's more like Diablo than Into the Breach and can make combat very tedious if turn-based, especially if you can compare it to Real Time where you can explode the puny goblins in 2 seconds.

Another thing that might turn off some people is the presence of [b]quest timers[/b]. What is it? Let's say that you have X days to complete some quests (or parts of a quest) otherwise you get game over (or the side quest is cancelled/failed). It might be scary to lose all your efforts because you rest too much or take a lot of time travelling back and forth in the overland map. I will say to [b]NOT WORRY[/b] and if you use common sense, you can quickly see what needs to be done with priority and what can wait. There is plenty of downtime towards the end of the game and the timers are quite lenient. I never had any issues with it and could explore plentifully.

Speaking about exploration, this game is about being a King (and a Baron before) but there's plenty of exploration to be done in the overland map. You will discover plenty of different locations such as ancient ruins, forests, dungeons, palaces and just plain outdoor maps. You have some big maps, some very small maps (sometimes with just one challenging enemy) and it's all well crafted, I never felt bored and actually felt a little bit like in Baldur's Gate 1 where you had more zones to visit/explore with small secrets everywhere.

The Kingdom management part is not user friendly at the beginning and can feel overwhelming, especially because the tutorial is a bit lacking and it gives you long-term objectives that looks like you need to do those now! Once you get used to it, it's pretty easy, especially since you can also customize its difficulty ([i]I recommend easy or effortless to not waste too much time or throw away your PC because of a game over due to your kingdom collapsing[/i]).

Once you are aware of the gameplay, what's the goal of this game? To become a King apparently. It's actually pretty entertaining and remind me a bit of Dragon Age 2 (its best part) where you see the evolution of your character and how your domain evolves.
[b]The best part of this game are the companions[/b], they are varied and even if some seems two dimensional, they are actually quite interesting and solving their inner turmoil is actually the cherry on top of the cake when you finish this game. They end up being your gang/family after a while. I even felt attached to some people I never took with me thanks to their quest still being very interesting.

The story itself is a roller coaster of emotions, lots of adventures which makes you walking a lot around the overland map. It's not the best story ever but is actually very interesting and full of Pathfinder lore (very different from D&D).

Regarding the DLC, the two extra companions (twins DLC) are okayish but nothing to write home about, the extra campaign that can be added (Varnhold's lot)) is good but also nothing spectacular and lastly the dungeon delving one (Beneath the stolen lands) is only for people who enjoy grind/battle/min-maxing a lot, a bit like the black pits add-on for the enhanced edition of Baldur's Gate. 
You don't need them to have a good experience, I would recommend only if you want to fully explore this game.

In conclusion, you can spend a lot of time for this game, especially if you are lucky and get it in a sale. It's very big but well done. I liked it more than Pillars of Eternity, the companions are awesome and there's plenty to do (even with those damned timers). Thanks to its very flexible difficulty settings, it's good for beginners (or people with no patience) and also for hardcore gamers. If you enjoy the old isometric games, this will be perfect for you.
The game is an almost bug-free experience, I only had one rest where nothing happened and had to restart the game.
If you want some D&Dish games, or like the isometric RPGs, this one is a keeper, it's not a game which will change gaming history but it's a good value/comfort zone RPG!",1706297440,1706297440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will not go into details on what is good about the game, you should play it and experience it for yourself!

kingdom management is not difficult, I would argue it is close to impossible to have your kingdom destroyed(a stat has to reach 0??) this aspect of the game could be seen as boring, but in a few chapters there is a lot of downtime that gets well put to use for raising kingdom stats.
You are never really stressed even if some missions have a 'timer' it is more than generous. 
I visited every single node on the map and still had downtime to take all kingdom stat ranks to >IX

Two big dislikes was when I started as an alchemist, evil alignment Valerie refused to join me which made some of the initial battles close to impossible.
*I re-rolled as a tank(evil) only to realize I could have save-load the diplomacy check to have Valerie join.
so re-roll again as an eldritch archer and this time go to the end.
well worth playing through the game with the set companions for their story and missions.
Second dislike was House at the Edge of Time, the whole chapter felt like a huge chore instead of being fun.

Combat was fun and challenging, some of the fights took quite a few tries.


I've played every isometric RPG you can think of and cannot understand why someone would give this a thumbs down, perhaps if you go from a similar game back to back.. but if you havn't scratched the itch for a isometric RPG game for a while, then this is a huge thumbs up.

Do not bother playing unless you plan on installing exploits - I encountered game breaking bugs that required me getting cheats so that I could teleport. After that it was pretty much pandora's box and I was teleporting everywhere, which probably detracted from several main functions of the game. Speaking of, the game is horribly unbalanced which can be immersion shattering as you have to tweak the difficulty to achieve satisfaction. Monster variety seems to range from idle mobile game to impossible on normal settings, so I found myself raising and lowering the difficulty constantly to compensate for that.

Wrath of the Righteous handled romance better, but Harrim in this game was hilarious - his melodramatic moping because he couldn't craft was super well written. Unfortunately Clerics suck, so I had no use for him outside of his storyline. Map design in this game is okay, but nothing to write home about. A lot of the side areas are literally exactly the same. Sometimes I want to see civilized communities in the same universe as my evil enemies, but this game gives us a bare bones rendition of that like many others from the genre.

Dark rooms being literally pitch black without someone holding a torch feels rather stupid in a world of magic where you'd think that'd be easy to address. The belt lanterns do practically nothing. So multiple areas go practically unseen.

Found myself enjoying kingdom management actually, until I started having to use exploits for that too. I mean, the devs really need to understand balance when RnG is a mechanic. You can't just have a bunch of easy tasks and then they just lob something your stats aren't high enough for.

In terms of lore and aesthetics, this game gets a lot of things right. A lot of the inventory management, layout, and topics hit the right vein for medieval fantasy. Nymphs and cyclops are heavily underutilized in most RPGs, so it was cool to see them play out here.

In short, while this game is good and features many things I am a fan of, such as being a party based medieval fantasy RPG with character customization and RnG, it struggles to execute these things in an immersive way when it comes to difficulty and bugs. I think they had the right idea, but with such a quantity-focused approach, failed to account for the player experience when for instance they teleport up to the top of candlemere tower and get stuck there making mods necessary, or are in a starting area and face an enemy that is literally impossible on normal difficulty just ~2 hours in and have to lower settings as to not feel unsatisfied with leaving the area. Stuff like this is important to making the best version of a game that can be, and I can see some players being turned off by how some things were executed here.",1706117265,1706117265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, I don't recommend this game unless you can get it on sale.

Don't get me wrong, this game does has positive aspects such as easily being able to change classes and level up a multitude of companions. It can be super overwhelming trying to plan out several characters but they have built in level up guides to auto level the companion characters for you. Other great things about this game is that alignment feels like it matters because some dialogue is locked specifically to certain alignment. Choices also matter a lot in this game! Some of the decisions you make early game are mentioned at the end of the game which is really nice!

The bad with this game is that it felt like a hack and slash and less like pathfinder. I also had too many choices when it came to spells and my companions would never cast spells despite having the setting for them to automatically cast spells turned on. This caused me to essentially ignore spells for the majority of the game and only used them when I was in a pinch. The game is also super difficult (but that is probably because I didn't use spells) and I almost lost a few times while playing on the easiest difficulty setting in regular combat. It is also possible to lose if your kingdom falls. This makes the game feel like work instead of a game because you have to check back in with your kingdom once a month and it is annoying to travel across the map before unlocking magic teleporters. It is also annoying that after a while, you start seeing the exact same maps over and over again for named locations and ambushes. My biggest complaint about the game is the ending dungeon. It took me 6 hours to crawl my way through the dungeon and that was with using a random guide online because the game uses a really annoying reality changing mechanics in the final dungeon. The game doesn't tell you which reality you are in either while in the dungeon. The final boss fight was easier than some of the mini bosses I bought leading up to the fight.

Lastly, this game has a lot of game breaking bugs to be aware of. One of my companions just disappeared and never returned and was never mentioned again lol The ending was meh in my opinion. The end cut scene happens immediately after beating the boss and you aren't able to return to your kingdom one last time. After the end scenes are over, it kicks you out to the main menu.

Overall, I would get this game on sale. You can easily put 100+ hours into this game if you wanted to. It has revolutionary mechanics that are not implemented well. I haven't tried modding yet but I've heard that mods make this game a lot better than vanilla Kingmaker.",1704064325,1705886442,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.
IT WILL BREAK YOU MENTALLY.
Overall, better story-wise and more classical than its contemporary isometric rpgs (PoE, Divinity, etc).
It's fun to play, at least until it becomes unplayable due to some game breaking bugs.

There are SO. MANY. BUGS. Whoever did the QA/Testing should seriously consider a career change, because that person clearly hates his job. I see so much potential in this game, but sadly, the sheer number of glitches/bugs in this game render that potential meaningless. I would list the bugs I personally experienced, but that would literally take me HOURS because there are SO MANY of them I can't even remember all of them. You experience a new bug every five minutes. It's insane.
Another problem with this game is that it is unbelievably unfriendly. The UI is bad, but I can live with that. However, I can't bear to look at the combat log. You right click it and it shows the DC and the result of your dice roll, but that's about it. It doesn't go into any more detail. Like, if a monster is immune to certain types of dmg, or a monster can only be killed by a certain type of dmg, then there should be some kind of an indication at the very least. I wanna know why my spells fail. I need to know how the game works and learn to use the rules to my advantages. But it's incredibly difficult to do so, because the game lacks feedback.

This could have been my GOTY. But it is not. And I doubt it ever will be. I know the devs are working hard to fix the bugs - I almost feel bad. They released two separate bug fixes just yesterday. In one day! Now that's a lot of work. Sadly, every time they release a new bug fix, they seem to generate another one. For instance, I am way past Amiri's second companion quest, and there was no issue involving it whatsoever. After the last patch, however, my world map keeps telling me to visit the Six Bears tribe like I haven't done the quest yet. It's not game-breaking or anything, but it annoys the hell out of me.


+ the level design is just horrible. I have more than 400+ games and played and finished more than 100 of them. And this is the most broken, unfair, unreasonable, and unkind.
Your level progression is very uneven. Items and equipments distributions are terribly skewed towards the late-game. There are curses and spells that can only be removed by certain types of spells, but you can cast these spells only once of twice a day. You need to set up a camp and rest before casting them again, but then you need supplies to do so. These things weigh heavy enough to slow you down, and camping also takes a long time. Time is another resource that you have to manage in this game, (it's really important) so you have to be very careful. But then there are certain debuffs that can only be removed by camping or visiting the healers (your own healers won't do, sadly) at the capital. There are just SO MANY THINGS you need to consider, it's very frustrating. The learning curve is extremely steep.

There are so many other problems as well. But I don't want to waste more time. It's painful enough for me that I've already put so much time and effort to beat this game, and now that I'm so very close to the ending I just have to finish this.

Combat: Fun to kill things, satisfying to overcome a challenge, rewarding loot, etc. Its a good time when a plan comes together and preparing for an encounter is fun. It's something I had to get use to since Im a blockhead who likes to rush in. The Prebuffing does get a bit much tho.

Characters: I havent really latched on to anyone. The main reason why I grew to care about my party members is because Im a sentimental fella. Overcoming these challenges is mostly my doing and yet it feels like im overcoming the odds with a solid team. Ekun is probably the only character rn that i care about due to the writing.

Progression: Solid as rock. Character building is fun. Its awesome to see the map develop as i adventure. Loot is exciting and impactful. I look forward to Leveling up. Getting a new piece of gear is awesome.

Which, I'm sorry, it isn't. It's still a game that's made 60% out of promises - and they're all interesting promises, too - but when it comes time to keeping them... So much of my time was spent being bored, frustrated or disappointed as I learned more about how the game actually works that I stopped giving the game benefit of the doubt when it went ""watch out for this next cool thing that's going to happen."" Where do you go from there? You play something else is what.",1705307900,1705307900,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS

The game is pretty faithful at recreating the tabletop game so if you like the Pathfinder you will likely enjoy this game. 
The story is pretty OK. Not the best ever, but still solid and much above average. 
The characters, locations, overall vibe are all good to very good. Again, some of it is a matter of personal tastes, perhaps, but it's still well done. 
It has the tactical element some people might be looking after - again, if you like the Pathfinder RPG or if you like D&D odds are you will like it a lot. 
The choices you make during the game do matter and have their consequences. 
There are quests connecting you with your party members and they expand upon their stories - it's really cool for the role playing aspect of the game, you don't feel like they are just some guys that happened to be around. 

The kingdom management concept is cool, and it's nice to see the game getting away from the absurd you often encounter where you lead a party of demigods, but somehow they are still just a party of adventurers, without much to their names. Here, becoming a baron and managind your domain simply fits into the story and I wish such approach was used more often. 

Now, let's move to the CONS. 

If you are familiar with the Pathfinder RPG and don't like it, you are not going to enjoy this game all that much. 
The journal often does not provide enough details or forces you to make some guesses. Compared to some classical RPGs, it's way less clear and way more confusing than average. 
There is a lot of timed events - but it's not always clear how and why they are timed, or what you can do to manage them better. 
Some pieces of interface are far from obvious - like oh, there's a timer to take down Stag Lord? Now that's interesting. You can manage - and it actually is important - the resting of your team and actually HAVE to use it to be able to rest and recover in a dungeon? Oh, it could have been somewhat more clear. 

Kingdom management has its issues and again - I wish many elements were simply more clear. 
Say, there's this event and I can't assign an advisor. Therefore, I fail the event and the kingdom takes damage. 
Ok, but it would be nice if one could check who is he missing, and where to find appropriate person without checking walkthroughs. 
One of the events literally relies on managing two projects through kingdom management and ideally stumbling upon a location that's not mentioned before. Again, not a tragedy, but it could be handled better. 
Lastly, a tiny example but one I've found very frustrating as it tells a bit about the way the game is designed: 
You need to reach location X and take part in an ambush. The ambush needs to be set in motion on a given day. 
Sounds ok, BUT: you are informed about the name of the day, you do not receive info how many days are left, you can't check the calendar to see which day it would be, the devs assume you KNOW the names of the in game world's days of the week. 
And sure, you can just keep waiting in the location - but if you can't manage your kingdom affairs remotely you may screw up one of the other timers, with consequences. 
Again, it's a tiny thing - but very frustrating as it literally is best to simply use walkthrough, or bother a lot otherwise.

So the bottom line is: yes, I can rather recommend but it's not a clear recommendation. There are too many small issues that can get VERY frustrating during a gameplay.",1705194305,1705194376,True,2,0,0.499192029237747192,0,True,False,False

A lot of reskins of the same enemies, very little variety in terms of areas, overall it just feels like the devs are throwing at you the same stuff over and over to keep you busy and increase the playtime. If you played BG3 you might have noticed the devs tried to make sure all encounters were different, even in larger dungeons. This is most definitely not the case here.

The interface is ok-ish but it doesn't hold well against similar games. It's also very ineffective at teaching the pathfinder system to those who don't already know how the classes are supposed to work. It could be because of that or because of the spongy approach to building enemies but wizards also felt unusually bad for an RPG in the endgame.

I really wanted to like Kingmaker, but I just don't. The writing is terrible. There is no plot progression. At first level you are tapped to build a kingdom? Seriously? I mean, fine... skip the rats in the basement quest... But JEEZE. At least make me earn an audience with the two most powerful figures in town. And what's with the Barbarian? She left her tribe, slew a frost giant, and stole his sword... AT FIRST LEVEL? Really? And she didn't get a SINGLE xp out of it? 

This is some seriously weak, elementary school, fanfic level writing, here. 

There are problems with the game design too. The worst of them is that there is no way to flee from combat. Often the only winning strategy to an encounter in an RPG is to swallow your pride and hoof it. Not in this game. In this game you're a bunch of lunkheads too proud and stupid to run away from an enemy that can easily TPK you. 

I appreciate the attempt to offer a spiritual successor to Baldur's gate, but this is a hard fail. The game has a few nice points. Graphically it felt like Baldur's Gate. I was actually incredibly excited at first glance. I was even willing to forgive the amateur writing... Until the gameplay fell apart. 

The games strongest point is the way they treat NPCs. It was a breath of fresh air to have NPC's that cared about the decisions you make. They were, as I mentioned, a little over the top but they did have interactions and banter with one another, which was nice. 

But overall? 

Nope. 

A for effort. But I don't give passing grades for effort. Overall grade: F.

Next time hire a damned writer, and don't force players to stupidly engage every random monster that crosses their path. Even Final Fantasy 1 had a ""flee"" action back in 1987.

- nice artstyle, honestly I dig it more than WotR. Especially the character portraits, just a bit more artistic imo
- the adventure 'feels' more grounded in a sense. sure, you're still a baron and not the typical person but you aren't granted mythical powers or fighting demons 24/7. you're dealing with wildlife, cults, managing your nation, some people might find it more plain but i prefer this kind of thing honestly. 
- a lot of the companions are quite cool too, I think my favorites would be Valerie, Ekundayo, Octavia, Tristian and Amiri. All of the other companions are also nice, and they grow a bit more as you  do their quests

I recommend waiting until next year if you want to buy the game. Just a month or two, and I'd bet they will have almost all of the game-breaking bugs resolved.

I really like this game's gameplay. I love the authentic D&D feel. What I loathe is the overwhelmingly feminist writing in the game. It completely ruins the female cast. After speaking with the female atheist paladin, I immediately wanted to throw her out on her butt as the whiner she is. That and this stupid comment, ""Don't pity me, my parents weren't bad people. They gave me something very valuable: my self-esteem."" Obviously, you don't have any self-respect, sweetheart. From everything you've said, you've done nothing to earn it.

So after that, I was looking forward to hearing the barbarian's story, and what do you know, she's a whiner too. ""I wasn't allowed to train because men are mean, but I kicked their asses because of feminism."" She's a barbarian; we assume she was raised in barbarian culture. If the barbarian culture doesn't normally produce female warriors, then you shouldn't throw a female barbarian into the party at the beginning of the game. Maybe make an outcast female barbarian warrior that you find later in the game. That would actually be interesting, but no, the game's dialogue constantly focuses on ""women empowerment,"" and if you actually believed in it, you wouldn't need to focus on it, and you could actually make a good game with good dialogue without it being overwhelmingly ""She and her"" for nearly every class description and have so-called ""strong"" women who do nothing but whine that they're women.

Also, men are stronger than women. Get over it. Women, in general, do not care to be macho macho women... because then you're turning a woman into a man. Men do like to be macho macho... because they're men. Also, men do not like bulky muscle-headed females, especially those who whine like a feminist. They could actually exhibit some strength of character and something more interesting than ""people said I'm beautiful, and it really hurt my feelings T_T"". So stop trying to do the same thing that is ruining comic books. You're not appealing to men or women with this sort of BS writing. However, whoever would write that drivel, I imagine, you're thinking. Well, just wait until the next game. Yeah, I'll be laughing hard to see how bad you can screw up a good thing.

The clock does skip forward 2 full weeks when yo level up a stat or claim a new region, and for one or two other specific causes. That is unusual, unexpected, and apparently to dullards it is beyond their meager ability to stretch a tiny bit intellectually and *plan* things out. ""Oh no, something that is different than how everybody else has done it! Why, in stead of adapting and learning to try and overcome this new and unique challenge, I am going to scream and bitch like a child because I want to play connect 4 and this is chess.""

The bones of this game are fantastic, and the carryovers to Wrath of the Righteous are well used. There are some QoL changes that were made that I miss in coming to the predecessor, but everything that made WotR great is very much present here as well:
- Gameplay is incredibly loyal to the RAW Pathfinder 1E rules, so it's very easy to know what you are getting yourself into for a ruleset. 
- Companions are unique, have distinctive personalities and drives, and are done decent justice in their reactions to your orders based on their alignment and motives.
- The ability to toggle between turn-based and real-time combat is fantastic. The feature makes it incredibly convenient to switch modes for some fights necessitate the use of actual tactics (the ones the lower intellects scream that you have to be hard tuned for). Getting exact positions and orders of operations and all when necessary, and just letting everybody run in a giant ball when it isn't, makes the pacing very friendly due to ease of control.
- This game is difficult, but this game is fair. You have a good amount (not as much as WotR) of control over how the game works with and against you. You can put it on the highest difficulty, then tweak things here and there as you want and wish. Honestly, a lot of the bleating gimps in the comments really just need to tune the difficulty a bit to adjust for their level of ability instead of screaming that what they think is fair needs to be core.

The game absolutely has some flaws to it, but none of them are anywhere near the level of melt-down screaming most of the comments have:
- The combat log could definitely be more informative. They fixed that in WotR, however in this game it shows maybe 70% of all the details. That can be confusing and frustrating to try and track down where and how certain modifiers are coming from, but this only matters if you are like me and wish to see the math on every single roll. And even then, I've yet to not be able to figure out the source of some 'Other' modifier.
- This game crashes and freezes more than it should. It isn't the worst by a long shot, but the fact that I get a crash or freeze about every 4 play sessions while loading is very annoying. The frequency and reliability of autosaves can be helpful, but doesn't always save your bacon and is still not an acceptable substitute for solid coding.
- Kingdom management is not as good as it is in WotR, Owlcat absolutely learned some lessons on that. The quests repeat frequently, about every 2 to 3 months they will cycle back but just with a slightly higher DC. It gets less interesting to read about what is happening when you realize it's just the Mermaid come back to, essentially, extort you.
- City building could be better, and again it is in WotR. How it could, exactly, I don't really know how to express. That is an aspect I am not familiar enough with to really be able to identify what makes it clunkier, a little less fun and more difficult to plan than in WotR. But it could be better.

Overall, absolutely a fantastic game. Especially considering that this is an updated version of the original, and a Kickstarter backed production that was the first real contender against the drivel and horrible excuse for a D&D game that is Neverwinter. You can really see the care the developers put into it, especially when you see how much of this they brought over to it's sucessor.

What you need to know before playing:

If you are not familiar with Dungeons and Dragons/Pathfinder, (5e) stuff, CUSTOMIZE the Difficulty when setting up the game.  Do not set anything above NORMAL.  

If you want to be more Casual about the game with less frustration, set the Difficulties to slightly lower than Normal.  

The Developers did a stupid job setting the Presets.  None of them set to Normal.  It's either Easier or Harder... meaning the game is always tilted one way or the other.  Too simple or Loaded Dice.

I like Challenging Settings, but I now set 1 setting to Normal, because if you don't, the Dice are LOADED and you will roll all low numbers, constantly.  This isn't challenging AI or anything it's just a lazy way to set difficulties, which every company does now... just tilting stats on enemies and making them sponges or giving them God-abilities/stats at higher difficulties.

Way back in the day, Game Difficulty was purely good AI programmed into the game...

It's a great game, you just have to set it up properly in the beginning, or you will hate this game.

If you do want to play this game on Challenging, or higher, without tweaking settings, or you're a D&D dumbass like I was, you need to research as you go, watch videos or research terms and mechanics online to understand what things do.  The Developers were not thorough in information, even on some items.  They half-way expect you to just be familiar with D&D stuff.  Such as Adamantine Armor... which reduces incoming damage, which is nowhere listed in the game/or on item.  If it's in the encyclopedia or something, I'm just not going through that.  lol  Put it on the God damn item.

Some skills, are over-explained and not concisely explained.  You might have to go look at forums and experienced players will tell you how things work within the system.

If you want the Challenge, you might have to research and learn some things as you go.

It is playable without research, but then it's Trial By Fire in some cases... finding out by experience.  So don't get pissed off in some areas. 

This is an involved game with a dynamic system, it's not for sissy-babies.  If you cannot hurt something in-game, it's because you need to Scout it, get Info on it, get items or use spells that better-effect it... etc.  

If you do not want a challenge... if you want to feel the brains seep out of your head after work and explore and beat things up, put it to Story Mode.

Or just Customize it.

The game is 1 Part System, 1 Part Dice Rolls.


The Review:

Before I start bitching incessantly...

The companions they made for the game can be fun at times, they are usable, you might like them.  They aren't as bad as Baldur's Gate 3.  This game is far superior in every way to Baldur's Gate 3 which is basically a fake D&D game and a total scam as far as I'm concerned... especially in the Bait and Switch they did for years unending until release.  BG3 is just basically for simpletons who have a sex and gore fetish; I failed to see a game and was so bored by Act 3 I quit.

This is a real game, by comparison, and doesn't need to be ultra-edgy and pander to the base of society to be liked.

This is a REAL D&D game.

This also has exploration, things to do, differentiation... customization, all of the elements in-game matter on some level... (not loaded with meaningless tropes or junk)... it can be fun if you like involved RPG's with some kingdom management.

Building in this game is fun.

Maybe your build might not work at first... try playing again, the first few levels.  You don't know what you like until you experience it and there's so many different things you can do in this, which IS what makes it awesome.

I love customization and choices, and this games has tons of that.

One thing I love, that saved this game for me, was companion customization.  You can hire your OWN mercenaries and create your OWN party members.  Of course the dialogue is going to be limited, so your game might be a lot quieter. lol

I just downloaded free portraits and learned how to stick them into the game files for use in customization (the ones you get initially are limited, I like my own portraits from fantasy artists).

Mercs can be EXPENSIVE.  Especially as they level.  But they are worth it to me.  I can make the game I like.

In saying that, the companions you are given, even initially... all the ham-fisted, pseudo-strong female types.  Ya... you cannot help but see this game sticks to the Woke agenda bullshit like most others.  This makes the companions unlikable.  Females that talk about not brushing their teeth, not bathing, messy, overly-oppositional or overly-aggressive to the point of feeling unreal... contradicting you frequently being a male character... all the same contemporary tropes being forced on people of 'how a female should be'.  

It's not game-killing or smothering you exactly... but it's there.  It's obvious.

The problem with pop-culture, forced propaganda themes in characters like this, is it's unimmersive.

It's not Swords and Sorcery.  It feels unoriginal.

Think Warcraft 1 and 2, Lord of the Rings, old 80's medieval fantasy movies/media themes... as goofy as they might seem now.  Sorry if my opinion seems dated, but the old Orcs and Humans and Swords and Sorcery were cool back then because they stayed true to the nature of themselves.

It's trying to be 2 things that don't go together.  It's trying to be pop-culture, forced bullshit from certain groups of people... trying to force their ideals and opinions on everyone else and into everything-media...

The romance options suffer... If a female character isn't just oppositional to you constantly, or straight up ugly and talking about how 'all men want me and I'm so beautiful and known for beauty and DON'T hit on me... don't...', they are absurdly slutty and hitting on you seemingly at all times... even when first meeting you and knowing nothing about you.  lol

It's not attractive Devs.  NEITHER is attractive.

I think they were made to look unattractive too.  On purpose.  Your options in this game are mostly unattractive physically and definitely by personality.  You just want to get rid of them and create your own character even if they don't say much. lol  

And the 2 mages you rescue... the stupid looking Orc that doesn't look tough, that they keep trying to tell you repeatedly, is a 'bad ass' and his slutty little bimbo elf girl friend ask you to have sex with them... because they are in an Open Relationship.

Okay..

I mean if you want that, in your story... all these 'woke' tropes and bullshit... fine.  But this is what a lot of people complain about.  It's everywhere and too much.

Companions are E V E R Y T H I N G to a Party-Based RPG.  EVERYTHING!

Knights of the Old Republic 2003 had a truly diverse set of companions who were all fun, interesting, fit the themes and story well... you wanted to use all of them in your party.  They were perfect.  Mass Effect 1 and 2 was the same... pretty good companions where most were likable or lovable.  They fit the themes, they were fun, they were truly diverse without contemporary propaganda and forced bullshit.

I can tell you too, the Companions in those games were what got those games Legendary Status and high reviews.  The story can even be 'meh' at points but if you have great companions, they add everything to it.

No one wants boring and annoying friends or to be stuck with someone who is perpetually oppositional... and then have the player be told they should like those characters because they're 'beautiful' or 'tough' or whatever... YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT IF THE CHARACTERS ARE DONE RIGHT.

The fact you have to sell that means the OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

I can tell you that's the major reason this game gets dumped on.

Regardless, the game is still very good.


Bonus points for Owl Bears.

The settings and scenes of adventuring and the opportunity to be a baron is simple, yet i loved it more than WOTR.
The character of the companions accompanying me in this game also preferable than WOTR in my personal opinion.

What i dont like in the game is the same as anybody told in their reviews, The kingdom management feels scripted.
We would like to drive our own kingdom into our own paths too, you know. 

I wish for the future releases the Devs in the future create more RPG-like atmosphere and adventures, instead of political stories of Kingdoms and Crusades.
If the characters meant to be a King or Divine, or top criminal or pirate, i hope THE FOCUS OF THE GAME will be about THE JOURNEY, THE DECISIONS, THE ADVENTURES of how he could became one, instead of MANAGING SOMETHING.

This supposed to be an RPG right? not a strategy?

Explore, journeys, interaction with friends, banters, camaderie and companionship, find myself a lover(s), things like that...
Find who your really friends are.

You get to enjoy hrs upon hrs of constantly reloading almost every encounter and mission against the mightiest of foes like wild boars who will desecrate your most private orifices in a hit while you miss 17X in row with all of your 5 party members until they are all smashed in bloody pulp.  You are privileged to be attacked by spider swarms who you cannot kill with any weapon except fire or acid because spiders cannot be stepped upon and the list goes on, and these are just initial fights in the first few missions you get to enjoy or you can take you gameplay difficulty down to a ""female genital organ"" hardness while being labelled amoeba, up to you.

My favorite part by far is the kingdom management, which I know is different from most reviews, but that's how I roll. It scratches the itch to make decisions and see your kingdom grow. Some people may feel like it limits and constrains things, but if you imagine its actually your kingdom you're taking care of and looking after it does feel fulfilling. Decisions matter, from who you pick to what you say.

The normal D&D/BG/Icewind Dale stuff is still loads of fun, but actually gets much harder than most other similar systems.

The companion characters are refreshing and realistic, and the choices aren't easy. There is one that's easy to miss though.

The endings and epilogues are great and really make it feel worth it, and the secret true ending is the best but such massive horseshit to unlock - totally worth the payoff.

The final normal dungeon is kind of a massive pain in the ass though, but the rest of the game is super fun. It was a labor of love, and it shows.

The character creation is also over-complicated and ridiculous with nothing explained well.

I made a retinue of specialized min-maxed mercs to fill in gaps and put the game into real time mode.

I played the game in a way that the developers probably designed it to be: Normal difficulty, with kingdom management. The long playing time can be explained by the fact that I spent a lot of time researching character builds and spells on the internet during the game.

I bought the game 5 years ago and it fascinated me from the first moment: Epic story, strong characters, lovely designed areas and quests, wonderful soundtrack, challenging. I loved immersing myself in the world of Pathfinder Kingmaker and enjoyed the immersion the game offered me.

But after several months, I didn't had the time to finish the game. I had to sunspend the game. It stayed on my hard disc for several years. After 4 years, I decided not to delete it, but to finally finish the game. I wanted to bring the story to an end. Shortly before the end, the game has gone totally mad: The game just wouldn't end!

Just before the ultimate finale, the battles became really challenging again and I had to use all my tricks to handle them (still on normal difficulty!). The great amount of fights were probably necessary to reach the character level to succeed the difficult final battle. But at some point it became too much for me. These endless encounters just got on my nerves. On the one hand I got angry and stood just before cancelling and deleting the game several times. On the other hand I had already invested around 500 hours in the game and there was no way to return. At this point, I could no longer remember the interesting twists and turns in the story or the characters. I only had one wish: Please, please just end!

Conclusion: After all, the game has a great story and shows in many moments that it was made with a lot of love and passion. For example, the side quests and main quest are intertwined very well. The side quests are no ""filler material"" but really contribute to the main story. The technical quality of the game is above average (e.g. no crashes). The creators of Pathfinder Kingmaker really made a good job, hats off!

But would I buy the game again?

No! If someone had told me before how long it would take me to complete the game, I wouldn't have bought it.

Would I recommend the game to others?

Only for players with a lot of free time. The game is very good, but due to the length of the game you eventually forget what happened months ago. The D&D ruleset is very advanced and takes a lot time to get familiar with. Kingdom management also takes too much time in my eyes.

Recommendations for new players:
- I recommend to disable kingdom management options completely. Expanding cities and hiring advisors sounds interesting at first. However, it's rarely relevant to the story. You may be able to unlock an additional ending with it and get some good equipment. But the required time is disproportionate to what the kingdom management offers. Disable it to save time and focus on the story.
- If you aren't familiar with the D&D rules in Pathfinder Kingmaker, don't be ashamed to choose the easy difficulty level - it saves you a lot time studying skills and spells. You can change the difficulty level at any time.

The final dungeon felt like nails on a chalkboard within an otherwise pleasant game. It was jarring to go from what I have experienced to something so abysmally bad. I had NPCs that have needed story-related items disappear, become broken, or otherwise act normally but then don't drop the items they were supposed to drop. I've had enemy encounters where the enemies become untargetable and invincible when they shouldn't have been. I've had items disappear from my inventory. I had companions rejoin me without any of their equipped gear from before. I've had companions just COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR and not show up where they were supposed to. I had to reload one section of the final dungeon 10 times before the cutscenes worked properly.

The story is great. I enjoy the characters. I enjoyed almost all of my time in the game. I even loved the Kingdom management and overworld exploration. It felt like a genuine TTRPG module that I was able to experience in a video game format. I even understand that, lore wise, the final dungeon *should* be annoying because of what creatures we are ultimately dealing with. But not to this degree. Not to the point where it legitimately does not feel worth it to finish a game after 116 hours. 

I ran into bugs that I was able to ""fix"" after about an hour or so of reloading, but I just got tired of it. For others who buy this, play, and don't get hard slapped by bugs, I'm incredibly happy you were able to experience the game. However, I will not be completing it and just moving on.

- Knowing that you will not see everything in the game in one play-through

Apparently, no matter which sex you choose, youre referred to as ""she"", and ""her"" in all descriptions, regardless... The picture choices are pretty lackluster for males too. Ive tried creating 4 or 5 different times now, and its just annoying the heck out of me, that all but 2 of the male portraits are crap, and plain.. All the female ones look badass. There is not even a male version of Elf, for cryin out loud!!! But they did make sure to make a cross dressing male.... If you do happen to create something you can deal with, youre referred to as ""she"", or ""her"" in all descriptions, conversations, and such, for the entire game. Its really frustrating, that an rpg where you can create anybody, the pictures all suck, and if you happen to create something, it goes out of its way to call you the wrong gender! There are only two, how hard could this have been to write!? 

They're admittedly minor gripes, but annoying when trying to create a character. They're also a very simple fix, and developers never bothered, so....  

In Chapter 2, you have to deal with ""An Ancient Curse"" several times.. It is timed, and worded so poorly, that even after 700hrs in this game, I still am confused by it. It will show you with 3 to 4 weeks to go, but you will get a popup telling you its time to prepare and do something about the attack.. And every single time, I waste days going back to the capital, back to Bald Hilltop, and not understanding what it wants.. So I inevitably go look online, only to be told you dont goto the Hilltop, but you send an advisor from the throne room AND you have to goto Bald Hilltop!.. 

The entire Kingdom management aspect is horribly done. I wanted to like it, but its poorly explained, has timers, hidden timers, dice rolls, and requires constant back and forth to the capital. It could have been really great

It is ENTIRELY too easy to accidentally delete a hired mercenary! There is a little ""X"" within their character window, when youre swapping teammates, and I have now twice deleted my mercenary! There is no way to get them back, aside from reloading a save, or you must pay tens of thousands of gold tor recruit a new one...

Edit: Ive finally started playing, and made it to an early cave (its literally, your very first side quest), to get some berries for someone, and ran into ""Spider Swarm"". Im playing on Normal, and have used FIVE fire bombs, and TWO Acid flasks against this single swarm, and still have not been able to kill it.. This is fucking RETARDED! None of the characters have an aoe, and the torches Ive equipped to two of the characters arent cutting it!  As if this isnt bad enough, all the regular spiders inflict a permanent -2 strength debuff on any character that they bite.. And it stacks!

Its now been 14 hours! Ive built multiple characters, and tried for 14 hours and the furthest Ive gotten, is to the first side quest... The first side quest, even on EASY, is an impassible barrier?! I even tried Turn Based mode (and do NOT recommend it in this game) Who the hell designs this crap?! 4 ""heroes"" cant figure out how to step on a fkn spider?!?!? Youre screwed if you dont have a Wizard?  The only way to do that, is create that character yourself!

This game is designed by idiots.


Pillars of Eternity, and Divinity Original Sin are both FAR better! Try them instead

PS: Turn Based mode is done terribly in this game, and the map design is small and lazy.

I even gave up entirely, and went on with the main quest. Ive run into multiple encounters where I seem to just get destroyed. Even after getting more teammates, I got wiped by some Deer.. The resting keeps confusing me, as Im left Fatigued, and awith a strength debuff.

This game is just awful, on so many levels.

UPDATE:
I decided to start, yet another, new character, and drop every single setting to stupid levels of easy mode (they have alot of custom settings for this). I got to the same area as another attempt, (the main quest, chasing the Gnome through a Mite/Kobold civil war) and died three more times.. I died to two different broken boss fights (one was a Worg that summons half a dozen allies, and the other an insanely over powered and over leveled Wisp boss battle, that the player has no way of knowing is there).  This is following the main quest mind you. I was told doing the very first side quest was for idiots, so instead I tried the main quest. Sorry, but when when Im running into THIS many early ways to completely stone wall the player, on Storymode settings, then the problem is not the player!

Ive even run into a Web trap, in the very early stages of the main quest, that can permanently disable your entire party, over, and over, and over again, with no way to get out of it, unless you have a very specific scroll/potion. This is absolutely absurd! 3/5 of my party remained stuck in this web trap, for 25 minutes, before I finally turned the game off! Had them all buffed with Resistance, and used the bard song, and still they remained stuck. Not to mention, the Web covers the entire screen, so you HAVE to pass by it if the trap triggers, or your trickery roll fails.

I absolutely adore this genre, and actually like everything about this game.. Except the way it was executed. Its the pacing, and insane difficulty spikes that ruin it. Im not even sure if I would enjoy it if I were an expert in the Pathfinder ruleset. I have tried over, and over, and over again, to play this game. I get dozens of hours in, learning a little more each time, and end up quitting out of frustration, from yet another thing, which I could not possibly have seen coming. Its likep laying a RTT game, where youre supposed to utilize quick load/save. In rpgs, we call that save scumming, and it feels like cheating.

I can only assume this company has no idea how to balance a game, or the rules for this game are so meticulous, and the player is expected to have known every single rule in the Kingmaker rule book, that only a very small amount of people will find this possible. Let alone, enjoyable.. This is TERRIBLE!  I am so sorry I didnt refund this garbage!

With all that said, you simply cannot deny that the 2 Pathfinder titles are the greatest modern crpg games.. They have the most depth, build diversity, replayability, etc.. And for all the issues I do have with it, I keep coming back to them.. Particularly because no one else makes RTwP combat anymore, andI believe its the superior way to play.

Some of my thoughts after finishing the game

- Character Creation is very complex and might be as deep as Mariana Trench (in a good way). I settled looking for a random build for each companion
- The Kingdom Management is a little unpolished but I liked it a lot, I do not know how you can pass it in higher difficulty without god amount of time save scumming results
- I have the funds to resurrect some permadeaths but nothing you can do being railroaded
- Some parts, like in Season of Bloom, would have shine if you can split the group into two parties

PROS
- Managerial concept
- Length and content
- Overall story

CONS
- Writing quality is well below par, lacks maturity, often naive and childish. Voice acting not great either, but does what it can given the material.
- Difficulty balance: Especially in the latest part of the game, difficulty ranges from point&click to impossible. Funkiller.
- Kingdom building mechanics: Insufficiently explained, very easy to get screwed by it. When you've got two decades of gaming but have to cheat your way through a game mechanic to avoid starting over 100+ hours of gameplay, something sucks.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker (PFK) represents a real-time with pause (RTWP) role-playing game (RPG), developed by the company Owlcat Games and published by the company Deep Silver. It is based on the Paizo Publishing’s Pathfinder franchise. 

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ Exploration & immersion. Vast and mature fantasy world with great love for detail creating an atmosphere of an old school Dungeon & Dragons (D&D) adventure. Choice of freedom how you deal with confrontations. Dialogues and events can be solved by an attribute or skill check. Excellent background music enriches the atmosphere.

++ Tactical depth. Multi-layered class and skill system allows for differentiated team setups and character customization. Strategic and political reasoning is tested on the world map and your interactions with the neighbouring nations. All these factors increase the replay value. 

+ Story telling & characters. Well written dialogues and narrative surrounded by a deep and complex mythology. Charismatic side characters have their own moral standards and will comment on your decisions. Solid voice acting. Alignment system is influenced by your choices. 

+ Difficulty. Implementation of a dynamic difficulty system provides RPG newcomers, veterans and masochists with a satisfying challenge. At its peak, it requires substantial skills at classical RPGs, experience in the D&D set of rules, and sometimes - a sheer amount of luck with dice rolls. 

o While the main questline and some of the dialogues with the party characters offer professional voice-over, all side quests and other events remain silent.

- Diamond in the rough. The game would have needed more time in the oven. Several hotfixes since the release. Missing pictures for non-player characters. Some items and skills do not work as described, e.g. the Necklace of Double Crosses.

[i] Summary: [/i]

PFK represents a high quality RPG experience with emphasis on exploration, and I cherish the immersion in its sophisticated fantasy world. It has rekindled my passion for this genre I thought lost since the Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale series of games. 

Recommended for curious adventurers and the masochistic core of RPG community.

The good:
- amazing music, a bit repetitive after a while but so good I didn't mind.
- amazing setting and characters; I really like the grounded fantasy vibe this game goes for, and I found the characters pretty well written in their motivations and differing personalities. I loved all their interactions at camp, they really made it feel like I was on an adventure with people and I was surprised that I never heard the same interaction twice even though I stuck with more or less the same companions for most of the game.
- great overall story; kind of connected to what I said about the setting, but I really liked the almost Arturian style of fantasy, with nymphs entering your dreams and stuff.
- pretty good roleplaying options; there is a quite a lot of dialogue and most of it does a good job giving quite a few different ways of reacting or approaching a given situation.

The bad/less good:
- once you understand it, the combat can be rewarding (especially on turn based, my preferred way of playing), but understanding it comes at the very high price of getting frustrated often. I stuck to an easier difficulty for most of the game and for me, the combat hit the sweet spot towards the middle of the game, while in the end the game drag on too long and the fights got so unfair that I put it on the easiest settings possible and let RTWP do its thing as I scrolled Twitter, just so I could get to the story/ending.
- obtuse kingdom management and quest design; it's very frustrating having to deal with a potentially game ending system that is never properly explained to you and punishes you later for earlier mistakes. A lot of the quests are timed and the game should really make the deadline clear.
- companion quests (at least the ones I experienced, I didn't experience all) end abruptly and in a very unsatisfying manner. I was hoping the quests would get better as they went on, not worse. Plus I didn't like some very questionable choices regarding the way Octavia and especially Rengar's slavery was handled. I was also a bit disappointed by the way romance was handled, with some easily missable and short scenes, as well as overall how short it was.
- the entirety of the last 2 Acts; while partly my own fault for getting anxious to finish the game and start BG3 as well as WOTR, by the time the last 2 Acts rolled around I pretty much turned my difficulty settings as low as possible, my brain mostly off and followed an online guide. The second to last dungeon was especially boring and left me relieved I relied on a guide rather than try and figure it out, which is a shame, because from a purely non-gameplay point of view, it's one of my favorite parts of the game as far as ""cutscenes"" and story content goes. Oh well.

Overall, I would still recommend the game, especially with how cheap it is, but get ready to put in the effort and time to learn the combat system and still get frustrated by bad or unfair design when you do. The vibes and the story made it worth it for me, but probably not enough for a full second playthrough anytime soon.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

First, it seriously lacks quality of life features. I know some games are rough around the edges and still very enjoyable, but for a game as expansive and complicated as Kingmaker, it really hampers the experience. For a few examples : there are no loot filters, so you have to either painfully pick up items one by one or lug around tons of worthless junk (in a game with encumbrance penalties) ; there is no way to speed up movement on the world map (in real life I mean, not in game time), so you spend the entire game slowly crawling around the world, slowing down even further whenever you go through a forest or a mountain ; tooltips aren't chained, meaning if an ability tells you it ""makes the target sickened"", it's up to you to research what ""sickened"" actually does instead of simply hovering over the word to get another clarification tooltip ; the game in general does a bad job teaching how the Pathfinder system works to people not familiar with it, and a bad job highlighting how it differs from it to people who ARE familiar with it.
Worst of the worst, is how feats are handled. You're just given a big alphabetical list (with a small handful of them being ""recommended"" or ""not recommended"" for your character, with no further explanation given as to why) and it's up to you to figure it out. Looking for something to enhance your attacks? There are no categories, so you have to read everything. Don't know what a specific effect does? Again, tooltips can't bring up other tooltips, so you have to look it up yourself (oh and if you quit during a level up you have to redo it all. If you quit during a serie of several level ups, you have to redo [i]them all[/i]). Feat trees? Feats tell you what their prerequisites are, but they don't tell you what feats they are a prerequisite to, so you have to read everything or you risk missing out on some good feats because you've been ignoring the prerequisite one since it's fairly worthless by itself. You get the idea. It's very, very tedious, and in a game with dozens of feats and build possibilities, that's a serious problem. (Spells have similar problems, by the way).

Then there's the balance. The game throws encounters of easy to medium difficulty at you all the time, then suddenly out of the blue it throws a ridiculously powerful boss at you without any sort of warning (some people will tell you it's to teach you the game mechanics. Personally, the only thing it taught me is to save every ten seconds because I might suddenly get completely screwed with no warning). Or it gives basic enemies extremely inflated stats for no particular reason. And that's in the first half of the game, the one that received a decent amount of attention from the devs. The later half just falls apart throughout, and the final stretch of the game in particular is a boring, tedious and frustrating slog that just throws the same three overpowered enemies at you in groups of five or more over and over again.

Also, the kingdom management. It's not very good. I could expand, but really, all I need to say is that in a game called ""Kingmaker"", whose premise is your character founding and building their kingdom from scratch, there is an option to completely ignore kingdom management and let the game handle it itself so you can focus on the adventuring part exclusively. That should tell you everything you need about how engaging the system is.

And finally, there's the railroading. If you're not familiar, ""railroading"" is a term used in pen and paper games (like Pathfinder) to describe the actions of a game master that forces you to do what they want, by providing no other options - like a train on rails - with the key point being that it's obvious that there SHOULD be other options, but they're simply not available. Well, Kingmaker does that, a lot.
Now, I have to say, I am very well aware that you can't have the same freedom in a video game as you can in a pen and paper. Of course you can't. The devs can't plan for every single possibility in advance like a game master that can react on the fly. But still, they can provide a series of decisions that approach what different people could want. In Kingmaker, the game prefers to either not give you access to what would be an obvious choice, or let you take the choice and then spit in your face.
Keeping vague to avoid spoilers, but here are some examples :
-At some point, an obviously evil character is trying to get you to do something. Context, some dialogue with a NPC earlier in the story, and even some [i]loading screen tips[/i] make it obvious that you should not do that thing. If you don't do it, despite repeated attempts from the evil character to get you to do it... well eventually another NPC does it for you. Three times over. And there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent that. And, predictably, you get screwed over because of it.
-A blatantly evil character is trying to catch another blatantly evil character in your kingdom, tearing it apart in the process. You have absolutely no option to exerce you authority as a [b]king/queen[/b] to deal with them. You have to let them do their thing, and if you want to reduce the damage to your kingdom, side with one of them so that can be done as quick as possible.
-An important character dies stupidly. The game suddenly forgets that it takes place in a universe where every major city has one or sometimes even several priests that can resurrect people. The important character stays dead and that potentlally causes a lot of problems for you, depending on how much you relied on them. This happens more than once. This happens a lot, actually.
-A lot of characters have serious plot armor. Deal a massively damaging critical hit to a bad guy? He survives and teleports out. Defeat that one bad guy? He becomes invisible and simply leaves, even though your group is enchanted with a spell that allows you to see invisible things. Defeat that one other bad guy? He doesn't even try to become invisible, he just leaves combat, becomes flagged as an ally so you can't forcefully blow him up, and casually walks away. Goblins in particular are heavily protected, for some reason ; attacking them is very often either treated as an evil action (despite them being considered evil pests in-universe) or outright not possible (even some dialogue choices clearly marked as ""[Attack]"" will result in no attack when it comes to goblins).

Really, there were a [b]lot[/b] of times where I thought to myself ""if this were a pen and paper game with a real game master and not a video game, this would have made have a serious talk with the GM or even outright walk out"".

Now, that's not to say the game is worthless. There's something very good at the core of it - I mean hell, I DID play it for nearly 140 hours instead of simply dropping it and moving on to something else ; it's just that it's buried under way to much rubbish for me to recommend it. I put up with it because those kind of RPGs are my favorite, and thus I had a lot of goodwill towards it, but even all that goodwill was burned out toward the end, to the point where my feeling after finishing it were not ""that was fun"" but rather ""glad that's done"".
It did make me want to keep an eye on the next game from the devs, Wrath of the Righteous, though. If it improves on the areas it mentionned, I might enjoy it a lot. But this one, no. Give it a pass, unless you are very patient and love RPGs. Or just play up to act 3 or 4 and pretend that you finished the game then, because it only goes downhill from there.",1644408241,1702752394,False,68,2,0.817582428455352783,0,True,False,False

First of all, it is MASSIVE, as in INSANE loads of hand-crafted content. The mechanics are also very classicist, i.e. a very detailed and accurate implementation of the Pathfinder ruleset, complete with very slow level progression (by today's standards), despite the huge number of fights you're going through.

The sheer number of fights and their challenge (if you don't dumb it down in the difficulty settings) means that this is a game for people who love tinkering with complex RPG mechanics and optimizing the heck out of their party. Some fights will really challenge you to think out of the box, and you will always need to be smart about managing your resources, because at some point you will be caught ill-prepared.

But what makes this game so massive is mainly the Barony mechanics that force you to travel back and forth through your entire realm, having random encounters and exploring every corner of your realm while expanding it through diplomacy, construction and questing. This serves to pace and spread the feet-on-the-ground content over this extra layer of event-driven political/strategic RP and city building mechanics. This additional layer is very well integrated in that it keeps interacting with your party gameplay through quests and resources.

Don't believe the negative comments you may have read about the encounter design. Enemies spawning out of thin air is extremely rare, and in the few cases I've seen it happen it was always somehow motivated through the story. Some people may also have gotten confused by invisible enemies. There are MANY encounters, and of course the random encounters are technically infinite and follow a set of blueprints.

The story is good, (I wish it had more voice acting tbh). Game play is smooth, I have experienced limited bugs. There are mods on Nexus Mods to customize what you want your experience with the game to be like.

Let's get into it, shall we?

Pros - The voice acting and story are absolutely top notch.  While the main plot closely follows the adventure module from the tabletop version of Pathfinder, additional character arcs and more have been added that enhance the game further.  In general, this game was a breath of fresh air seeing how tabletop can be brought to life.  From a gameplay standpoint, it tended on the more difficult end, but was rewarding all the same.

Cons - There are definitely some balance issues that happen in combat when you take a tabletop game and convert it to a realtime strategy.  In many combats, it ends up being either too easy or too difficult.  Additionally, the AI for the spellcasters truly needs adjustment such that the main character doesn't have to micromanage it.
Lastly, the campaign mode in the Stolen Lands takes away somewhat from the plot.  While it is great that it can be turned off, it would be nice if it could be improved or changed.

Overall, this game was fantastic, and I definitely still recommend it.",1701231594,1701231594,True,1,1,0.510337352752685547,0,True,False,False

Tried this game again years later, and I'm having a fun time.  The bugs are no longer present, the gameplay issues have been smoothed out, and I'm having a good time.  Wrath of the Righteous definitely improved on a lot of the things here, but the kingdom mechanics of this are a lot of fun by themselves.

Definitely recommend!

*OLD REVIEW BELOW*

This game is currently broken.  I'm not talking about the weird difficulty design, I'm talking about bugs.  The further you get into this game, the buggier it gets.  Not minor bugs, game breaking bugs.  I'm in chapter four and so far I've:

1) Been unable to recruit a companion because the dialogue cycles endlessly
2) Unable to finish a quest because, as far as I can tell, the item never spawned and you can't go back and get it (the area closes).  Additionally, this same NPC will ask for your help and then disappear if you accept.
3) Unable to finish any artisan quest.  They keep talking about how they will deliver it soon or whatever.
4) In addition to the above, Bokken visits my throne room every. single. day.  Sometimes he comes as other artisans too, or other artisans come as him.  I have no idea how this got so fucked up.
5) Amiri wouldn't rejoin my party in Chapter 4, and now that they ""Fixed"" it, she can rejoin but doesn't act as if she's in my party (isn't healed by resting, doesn't take commands, etc).

I simply cannot progress any further without missing out on important gameplay/story things.  I've dumped a substantial amount of time into this game and I feel like I've been duped into beta testing it.  When this game is good, it's great, but it launched at least a month too soon.

* Good adaptation of Pathfinder Rule system. Not 100% exact, but pretty close. Decent variety of options (classes/archetypes/feats).
* Nice storyline (Kingmaker module was a great choice to adapt), with nicely fleshed out companions & dialogues.
* Developers are active in addressing issues (we're only a few days past release as of this writing, but still).

Negative:
* BUGS. Heaps of them. Currently I'd call the game playable but not enjoyable. This may (hopefully) change in a few months time though when the worst issues have been addressed.
* Loading times are pretty awful. Each game startup takes several minutes, plus another minute or so to load a game (which you'll find yourself doing a lot, for various reasons) or to transition into a new area. Developers said they'd look into this, so we'll see how this goes.
* Lack of documentation. There is in-game documentation for feats and class abilities, but not always correct (bugs), and not always accessible right away (e.g. you must qualify for a prestige class to gain useful info on it). Other things like combat mechanics are lacking explanations, which does matter as not everything translates 1:1 from Pathfinder rules.
* Real-time combat rather than turn-based. This may be a matter of preference, and does have the advantage of speeding up easy fights, but it makes takes tactical maneuvering impossible. While the system is similar to NWN (which worked very nicely IMO, and had to be real-time to function for multi-player), the differences are that (A) in PF:KM you would need to micro-manage up to 6 characters instead of just one, and (B) left to its own devices the AI is pretty poor (from wizards rushing into melee to bards not bothering to sing and barbarians not raging).
* Difficulty spikes. On standard difficulty most fights are walk-overs, but every so often you walk into completely unmanageable encounters. In PnP you would run from such fights, but here you can't (savegame here I come).

TLDR: Has potential, but lots of bugs/issues that need to be addressed first. Combat isn't tactical.

Update one year on:
* Loading times have improved - still takes a while but much better than before.
* A bunch of bugs have been addressed, but still plenty out there.
* Linux bug ddoouubblliinngg all inputs still isn't fixed. Safe to assume it never will be.
* NPC AI is still a joke, requiring micromanagement (or lower difficulty).
* Difficulty spikes have been reduced.

2023 update:
* Linux doubling bug has been fixed, along with a bunch of others.
* A turn-based mode has finally been added. Makes all the difference.",1538354089,1701010933,True,0,0,0.468408912420272827,0,True,False,False

My recommendation hasn't changed, but I can be more concise about the reasons I wouldn't recommend on it but rather on the sequel, Wrath of The Righteous, where most of the defects were fixed.
While the game does have merits - a wonderful soundtrack, a rich and flexible RPG system, decent graphics, challenging combat and somewhat sympathetic cast of NPCs, it suffers from four major flaws:

1. Lack of a strong driving narrative - the player character does not really have a personality or a story. It's unknown what is the source of his ambition and why he keeps pushing through adversity. While the PC can make a lot of moral choices they are mostly disconnected and very rarely have a major effect on the plot or limited by prior choices. It mostly occurs on companion quests. The main story is made of seemingly unrelated crises until about 40%-50% into the game when the master plot becomes clearer.

2. Horrible kingdom management system - the unholy trinity: time management, stats management and random events. You need to multitask between story quests, kingdom stats and hard time limits and it's simply a pain in the ***. I recommend either playing without this aspect or using the bag of tricks mod to make it bearable.

3. Repetitive battles - each chapter of this tale has too many encounters with the same enemies with the same special capabilities, whether we're talking about fire-resistant Trolls, undead Cyclops or Wild Hunt Fey. As a result, the battles tend to become tedious and repetitive very quickly. The random encounters are also poorly done as the rewards are meager since you're often ambushed by much weaker enemies. I recall a memorable pair of brave Kobolds that ambushed my level 14 party. No way Jose.

4. The final chapter (general spoiler) - after managing to push through the longest and most tedious dungeon in the entire game, the developers ""reward"" you by crippling your high level characters in order to make the endgame challenging. This is an example of poor writing and very poor balance. I admit I lost my patience at this stage and used the bag of tricks to finish this chapter and end the game. IMO, if the developers feel it's legitimate to blatantly cheat there's no reason the player wouldn't.",1686177876,1700437120,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has an amazing story, well written dialogs, interesting characters with unique backgrounds, and some of the best boss fights that I can remember.

The options to build a character in this game are near endless and the amount of content is well worth the price. I spent nearly 160 hours as you can see, and only finished the game once, without the DLCs.

There's also some questionable design choices and rather annoying systems like the kingdom management, but I loved everything else and the positives far outweigh the cons.

It has quests that require google to figure out where the hell you are meant to go, because the journal just gives you a dead end. The moving around the world is a good concept, but again not well polished. 

It has game breaking problems like kingdom management that just up and ends your game without you really knowing why.

It has certain dungeons and monsters that are utterly unbalanced. It requires you to essentially see the fight, then reload, go back and load up on whatever specific spells, wands and potions that you need to stop whatever BS the monster pulls on you. This kills immersion because you are not playing as your party, you are just learning how to glitch fights by some stupid meta.

The relationship between party members is really really clunky. Sometimes the writing is great, other times, it is like they got drunk and just hammered it out.

In the end what this is, is a game that is 95% great, and the other 5% of the time you just hate it and stop playing for a bit. It does not sell itself well, it just hurts you because its not that well polished. 

It suffers from the 'ADD MORE DLC' rather than just fix the game they have made. It would not take much. Just some tweaking of mechanics.

It also needs to avoid the trap of 'I make this fight hard by using a cutscene to dump you in the middle of an ambush'.

It needs to realise why people play these games. Everyone wants to be a god, everyone wants to play the story. Make the combat fun, or even hard, but don't just make it unbalanced as hell just to give it the impressions of being hard.

So at the completion of this review I reloaded the 'Soul Eater' fight. One hit the SE did -5 wisdom damage. Seriously fk this stupid game.

In general this game has a lot of interesting concepts but it need to better implement them. To finish this review a have one metion about this game:

It has often been said that this game feels like just playing tabletop pathfinder, but with an evil DM that's there to beat the players instead of telling a good story. And it's true. This is how it feels.

That being said, I still had a difficult time with the pacing and the numerous difficulty spikes throughout the game. In the tutorial section alone there were encounters that would far exceed your fledgling party's capabilities without seriously min/maxing your characters for the first six levels or save scumming. Normal can be considered a harder level of difficulty for the unaffiliated and challenging moderate for those familiar with the system and tailoring parties. An attractive system for fart sniffers and difficulty snobs, however, disorienting for nostalgic tabletop players with limited time on their hands, that prefer a challenge without saving and loading to get by. Another irritating aspect of this game is the interface, as frustratingly, changing from keyboard to controller requires a reload, and mods are not accessible without the use of a keyboard. This can corrupt your save file when trying to transition back to gamepad, forcing you to utilize the mouse and keyboard for that save file exclusively.

My biggest gripes are lessened by playing on easy:  
1) Saving your game file starts taking longer, and longer, and longer as the filesize grows to absurd proportions. 
 Load screens are even worse than the save times and wreck your immersion.
2) The kingdom management mini-game that sets this game apart from all the other D&D games is poorly explained.  Initial mistakes are unrecoverable and you won't know you made them until they become game-ending.  
3) Combat is pathetic.  Some encounters end in 2 seconds with a lucky critical hit while others are just a slog through mobs with sky-high armor class.  Mid-game is the peak because you have decent gear and skills that can even out the random dice-rolls, but in late game it's just a matter of whether you get to the end before your supply of mass-heal scrolls runs out.
Overall, there is just so much of the game that is either poorly implemented or poorly explained that you are better off starting in super easy mode.

The problem is that it is riddled with game breaking bugs and the developers seem to have abandoned any attempts to patch/fix them so they can invest their time in making a whole bunch of paid DLC for their next game.

For example: I got this strength penalty debuff and the game tells me I can get rid of it by resting. In my previous game this worked but in my current game the in-game text says the strength penalty is removed but my character sheets show an extra strength penalty on top the penalties they already had. And this happens in an infinite loop, every time I rest it says the penalty is removed while adding an extra penalty. RIP save game.

Update one: After 18 plus hours, this game just gets worst and worst, the more I play it the more I hate it.

Update two: After 88 plus hours, I can only say FUCK this game, when it's not borring it's unfair, trowing you to a boss fight with zero prep time. The summons will attack what few enemies you have managed to facinete thus waking them up and if you hit a key to many times to skip the actions of said enemies you might skip your own characters actions too.

The names are for a fight where you go against a level sucking creature who might one hit kill your character based on how it's built, not only that, two of my characters for the fight deal their damage by using summons, but only the named character can deal damage to it, so I am fucked. I can see this being fun if you knew what was coming and chose your DPSs name while your other characters support them, or in a tabletop setting were if you die you can just make another character, but in a videogame where this might lock you out almost 200 hours in?!

For example you have a kingdom to manage, one would think you could be like a king, resolving problems in your kingdom, playing politics, religions and such, sending people to find treasures in adventures but not, the kingdom manage is choose this card and who goes there, now you have a chance to fail, if you win points and if you don't you lose points. Now here is the problem if you don't have enough points your chances to win and event are zero and it becomes a death spiral where to not lose points you need to win them but you cant, not only that there are chapters where there are negative effects for your kingdom and in most causes it is bugged so even if you have done the mission the game still takes points from you until you enter the death spiral.
All this could be forgiven if the rest of the game was good, but it isn't. The music is not there, the characters are very bland to the point that i only remember 2 of them, the karma system dictates that you only can win if you are good otherwise you lose almost all of the companions. The combat it is a bloat.
And now the grand final the thing that lead me to write this review, in the last hours of the game you will have to face 2 big bads, a fucking plant and a sun Really? that is your villain? but the worst part is the dungeon oh the dungeon is the most stupid design i have seen ever in a video game it is bullshit the enemies have infinite spells that stun you and make you miss everything not only that the bosses have a heal that cures all your damage, so the only way to win is to have a strong dps and kill the boss but oh hey we made it so unless you have made all the companions quests to the matching point we want they die or they leave, so you have to win the dungeon with not all your party members, and you will say but hey there are 4 optional extra members if you go outside the dungeon, and to you i say what if they are worst than the companions you used to have, what if you are perma stuck in a boss fight because the fucking enemy doesn't die? and it just heals and heals eternally.
Finally to the developers i want to say you shouldn't do more rpgs you don't have the skill to do it, with the amount of bugs, poor designs decisions and the jojo you have 10 days to do this or you lose mentality your skills are more of a visual novel than a rpg developer you should just i don't know make something for people of the Mars because that is the only kind of person that could enjoy such a shitty game like this.",1698600893,1698600893,False,2,1,0.487642556428909302,0,True,False,False

Another roll of 10 or under and i am running arround the battlefield screaming instead of doing anything useful.

While it still has point and click mouse movement, being able to play by directly controlling the characters movement with a game controller is awesome. Controller support is built in, but one can only change controls via Steam. I tried making a couple changes to the controls for logic and convenience, but the button prompts wont change that way. It wasn't a problem in character creation, but since buttons have different effects in game consciously remembering the control difference as I was learning what buttons do became inconvenient, and I ultimately changed them back.

Between that, adjustable (menu and in game) settings, difficulty settings (on new game), and character creation I'd already spent 5 hours before starting the game. There are tons of difficulty settings one can adjust, several playable races, tons of classes and subclasses, stat customization, selection of skills, feats, and abilities, name, birthday within the worlds calendar system, et cetera. Although there are templates available for both the difficulty settings and characters, so one could always go with some of those if wanting to jump right in. One could also just create their character based on the names of things without reading the detailed descriptions and mechanic effects and probably get through custom character creation in as little as 10 minutes. 

If you nerd out like I do on customization options it's awesome, but even I was getting tired of it after about 3 hours in. One way they could have improved this is by displaying feats in collapsable list trees rather than a single list of all feats that all types of characters could get in alphabetical order. Alphabetical order is useful for finding something specific that one's looking for, and horrible for something like their feat selection system. Since it mixes all different kinds of feats together, and would require memorization of every individual feat for every character and class build in order to be useful in alphabetical order. Where as collapsable list trees organized by requirements and prerequisites would work perfectly, making it easy to ignore feats unrelated to ones character build. 

The only other way I think they might have done it better is by perhaps making some of the content unlockable through gameplay, with the name showing with a lock and information on it hidden. Like with the rarer or less popular races, as well as subclasses. This would speed up the character creation process significantly, add an extra goal in gameplay, and increase interest in replaying the game with the unlocked options.",1697559568,1697559568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Looking back at this game now, with more experience, it's kind of a train wreck. In the last two days I've seen two instances of characters stuck under the map and dealt with at least ten freezes or crashes due to inventory load fails- pressing that hotkey has started to fill me with dread. Out of the box, you really wouldn't know this code has been repeatedly patched. 
No control over when saves are made, plus aforementioned instability, made my attempted last azlanti run absolutely hellish. Now I know why that achievement is so rare- no one likes to repeat an encounter three times because some programmers wrote spaghetti, especially when that encounter is preceded or followed by needlessly long unskippable cutscenes and dialogues. I hoped to earn a cheevo with my strategic foresight, not my tolerance for wasted time.
Changing the difficulty settings does apply a few global modifiers in combat, but doesn't actually soften the biggest challenges of gameplay- namely, avoiding soft lock from kingdom mismanagement or hidden dialogue consequences, while also recovering from untelegraphed and/or unavoidable encounters with overleveled enemies. Combat AI will get you killed, auto level up will brick companions. Lots of features here that weren't written right or weren't thought through in the first place. Annoying.
There's a handful of viable builds to choose from and I honestly enjoy playing them, but they are not intuitive for beginners. That's mainly a fault of paizo's work designing first edition pathfinder ruleset, and not owlcat's work delivering it as a computer program, but it remains a demerit. So much of this game's design and implementation falls irredeemably short of the excellent narrative work. I saw a forum comment describe PF:Kingmaker as ""balanced around save scumming and metagame"" and I tell you what, that guy nailed it. Even the lowest difficulties seem to assume that you have already seen where the story is going, or else you're reading a walkthrough while playing. YMMV, but just play kingmaker with friends over virtual tabletop and get all the benefits without forcing yourself into this quagmire.

Even if you're a Pathfinder fan like me, this game is a hard sell. 

The simulation of Pathfinder is honestly really good for the most part. There's a wide variety of classes and archetypes, a serviceable number of races, all faithfully translated to cRPG. The voice acting is fun, although the character writing is pretty 2-dimensional (which, I admit, is not that big a deal, plenty of tabletop games have simple writing with players that have fun, if flat, characters).

The main point of contention for me is that, in the opening sequence where you're hunting down the Stag Lord, the game completely fails to provide a good beginning experience. You're presented a whole region to explore, full of adventure and treasure, except that 70% of the encounters in these areas outclass you by a hilarious degree, indirectly railroading you to just the main story beats until about level 5 where your party has enough HP to last long enough in combat that they go from getting roflstomped to 10-20 minute long defeats followed by a reload. I'm skeptical that the dice RNG is set up properly, because I've played a good long while now and my party making atrocious rolls almost non-stop has been a constant factor, with the only recourse being to just stack bonuses until they land attacks or spells at least half the time. The enemy AI fights like a computer, rather than a DM, bee-lining for your squishiest characters regardless of the furious barbarian barreling towards them (whereupon she will miss 6 times in a row despite an ostensible +10 to hit from various sources). Meanwhile, ally AI is barebones. An example: I cast web on an enemy group at range, anchoring or slowing most of them. I can now have my party engage them with ranged attacks. An allied Magus (a spellcaster/warrior hybrid) proceeds to charge into the web's area of effect, failing their save and becoming rooted like the enemy, unable to engage the enemies that I know for a fact are fully in rage of that character's ranged spells, which they simply refuse to use.

TL;DR: It's a good mechanical translation of the Pathfinder ruleset and the Kingmaker module, but that's irredeemably spoiled by  baffling encounter design, one-sided AI, and suspect RNG. Just find yourself a DM and a group willing to run Kingmaker if you want to enjoy what this module has to offer.

UPDATE: I tried to pick this game up another time, playing on a lower difficulty. Still a no, sadly. I was rolling along, enjoying the rush of grabbing more and more loot, kitting my party to be as busted as possible. I fiddled with multiclassing and shaking up the companions a bit. Kingdom management was coming along nicely. I was a little bored that on ""Normal"" difficulty you can just kind of turn your brain off and bumrush nearly every non-boss fight, but other than that I thought this was the one. Nope. 

Minor spoilers ahead: Season of Bloom is what broke me. I'll be honest, I hate fey creatures in any RPG setting because they're always played as child-like and obnoxious, meaning they're annoying if they're your ally and unfit to be villain material. I can't enjoy an antagonist if they have a nonsensical motivation/morality. So I really did not give a damn about Nyrissa's backstory. 

I also REALLY didn't appreciate the ABSURD hordes of buffed-up monsters you have to SLOG through during this arc. They're in that hellzone right between ""Easy enough to switch to Real Time and just hack n' slash"" and ""Have to fight them in Turn Based"", so they aren't satisfying to fight in Turn Based time and time again, but you can't go Real Time to speed things up because they're too dangerous. Then you get to the Womb of Lamashtu and the Other World dungeons and it's just horrific swarms of invisible, hasted spiders. Forget that.

The straw that broke the camel's back was a riddle not really worth solving, but just obtuse enough to hang me up to the point that I called it quits. I've also read that there are parts of the game that harken back to this level of nonsense later on, and I'm really not feeling investing ANOTHER 200 hours to get to that point. 

Once again, just go put a group together to play the updated Kingmaker module for Pathfinder 2e, it'll have similar story beats as homage to this game, with all the fun of friends and (hopefully, if your GM is at least marginally skilled) without the pains of this game. Sorry, Owlcat, but this game is best equated to a 24-course meal made on the cheap: An absurd amount of content, only some of which is actually stand-out, and the majority of which is alright, with a few really awful dishes in there at random.",1670004472,1697516792,False,30,3,0.66257321834564209,0,True,False,False

For anyone who enjoys Pathfinder 1E, Kingmaker definitely delivers a fun experience, with a few underwhelming elements. Sometimes, navigating dungeons can be a pain if your whole party fails certain skill checks (which can only be repeated once per level), and certain quest decisions don't make much sense (I found Valerie's personal questline abysmal after a certain point). 

This is not to discount the fun of building an effective party and optimizing buffs and combat strategies. As long as you have a decent grasp of how the mechanics work (which bonuses stack, preparing the right defensive buffs like Death Ward, Resist Energy, etc.), it is satisfying to see things work out. 

As for the Kingdom-Building components, I did not find them particularly well-explained, but despite that, I found the content engaging. In fact, it often worked towards my detriment: I would spend so long managing my kingdom and building its stats, that certain events would happen and hamper the stability of my kingdom. So on that end, I recommend tackling the main story objectives before working on the Kingdom-building content. 

Overall, this is a strong CPRG with a fairly orthodox commitment to the TTRPG ruleset. If you enjoy the Pathfinder mechanics, or are willing to learn them, this is a worthwhile experience, though the length of the campaign might be a turn-off. For fans of Pathfinder, I would give this game an 8/10, and a 7/10 for those who aren't (but would still enjoy a lengthy crpg in the style of the older Baldur's Gate games).",1697417112,1697417112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Adventure and CRPG is just as outstanding and feels much like a kindred to Baldurs Gate II complete with companion quests and romance options and I guess it's thanks to Chris Avellone. 

Despite what else this game includes I would recommend the game for the Adventure, Dialogue, Companions and CRPG. 

The game is like a hybrid of Adventure and Strategy and you need to play both parts to advance the game and continue progress and the Strategy is what pretty all ""else"" is about and it's really short on requirements, use and necessity. 

The ""else"": There are a lot of confusing and tiring elements in the game like the whole kingdom management part and the slow travel speed and the constant need to rest when you move on the overland map. Later in the game you get the possibility to make a portal system in your villages, which I think should have been available much sooner in the game and it really helps to spread out and put your villages close to hotspots and generally far away. 

In general there is a truly annoying lack of information in the game about the game and requirements of Kingdom Management where I'd recommend googling for ""Kingmaker Advisor Requirements"", even though it doesn't cover it all, like the lack of advisors and the growth of your kingdom. In general I googled a lot of stuff, but I do not recommend reading spoilers and walkthroughs. On one hand I would recommend you to be a little responsible yourself and turn a blind eye to that which will ruin the exploration, but on the other hand it can be a pretty long game... So...

If you can play it, should you.   Short answer:  No.  Stat stuff follows.
Lets look at game play.  After the first chapter you must keep an eye on your kingdom, checking in every week or so.   In effect the game becomes an escort mission where you are escorting a city.  However it takes so long to travel to a new area you need to turn around almost immediately to get back in time.   Compounded by how often you pick up status effects you cannot cure in the field.

An example of this is poison.  An area that you MUST complete when you are at most level 4 has a character with +7 to Fort saves failing about 75% of the time.  Statistically that puts to poison DC at 20+.  For a level 3 - 4 party.  These things attack in swarms, and some of them can poison multiple characters per attack.  At that level you have no way to cure the poison (DEX damage) except returning to your base, taking most of a day one-way.  It seems that most of the game is merely there to drain all your money in healing items.

And you WILL take damage.  The enemies are buffed in bizarre ways.  Example:  Bandit, Level 4 fighter(+4 hit) STR 18(+4 hit) weapon focus(+1 hit) Power Attack(-2 hit) No magic.  That is a +7 to hit (the game will tell you this with a skill check)  So why does he need a 12 to hit my AC 28 tank.  Where is the extra +9 coming from?  I buffed 1 character so that she could only be hit on a 20, thinking she would win by attrition.  4 of the first 6 attacks against here were 20s, she died in 1 round.

The reverse is also true.  That bandit I mentioned had a listed AC of 17.  So why does my +10 to hit tank need to roll a 14 to hit him?  An extreme example of this is when I missed by one 13 attacks in a row.  That is, if I needed a 9 I got an 8.  3 of my character only miss on a 1.  I rolled only six ones, all for them.  The probability of 13 miss by 1 rolls in a row, by the way, is a staggering 81,920,000,000,000,000 to 1.  I get the feeling the game is playing with loaded dice.  As near as I can tell every now and then you will have an encounter and the game will decide: ""OK, lets drain about 40% of there HP before letting them fight back.""  Hope you weren't trying to save up for the gear that MIGHT help you survive, 'cause it's all going to the clerics.

The game design is also poorly done.  The first clue that you are heading into a high-level area (right beside the starting areas, btw) is when your level 5 party runs into a random encounter with 2 level 17 elite undead.  Reloading becomes a very normal thing.  For normal difficulty.

There is also idiotic decisions that get made for you.  ""Well, this person who we know serves someone powerful is finally dead.  Our actual mission is to bring him, or his body, back to the guys in charge.  But, let's leave him here; after all, nothing bad can happen in a world where resurrection is a thing and one of my on party is undead.""
The general feeling I get from this game is the makers didn't know HOW to make a good game, so they hide their failings by cooking the books.

I would recommend not purchasing this game.  I you do, hit the Nexus and download the cheat pack.  If the game cheats, you shouldn't feel guilty about doing it.",1697250020,1697250020,False,2,0,0.451841741800308228,0,True,False,False

Actual reasons:
1. Despite being a Pathfinder game the developer opted for this abomination of a timer based RTS system which is just awful in every possible way.
2. Difficulty setting seem to be entirely based on messing with RNG, not by adding anything of substance to the game, which results in a binary option; low difficulty and no challenge, or high difficulty and no fun; as the game forces you to miss and be hit rather than letting the dice decide.
3. I expected the number of available option in character creation to be small compared to the tabletop game, but not that small, and even then not implemented in such a limiting way.

It took me 30ish hours to beat the first act on normal difficulty and the game shows no signs of slowing down, I don't think I've ever spent so much time looking at a level up screen, I think one negative thing about this game is how some of the descriptions of some spells and abilities you pick on level up aren't explained very well, but you can save before level up and test things, experiment, and on the starting difficulty selection screen you can select the ability to respec.

Once it clicks, you'll play for hours exploring the map and managing your kingdom. Character builds are incredibly versatile, but that also means you can easily make a worthless character if you don't pay attention. If you are new to Pathfinder or cRPGs in general, you definitely should look up some character guides online to make sure you aren't choosing conflicting build features. 

However, the game really shines when you get into a good loop of exploring a region, finding quests, and returning to the capital to manage your kingdom affairs. The companions are enjoyable (especially Jubilost) even if they aren't as deep as some other RPGs, and there are a lot of choices to make that shape NPC relationships and how your kingdom develops. I particularly like how your character and kingdom's moral alignment affects what kind of events happen and what kinds of buildings, structures, and infrastructure you can build. 

The game is definitely rough in the early hours when you have no resources and characters as squishy, but once you get through those first few hours and get some levels, things get much smoother.

The game is designed pretty much from the ground up under the assumption that you know every single trick in the game and are willing to use every last one of them. It's very, very unfriendly to new players. If you can't munchkin up a character who can solo the game then it's going to be tricky on the standard, normal difficulty. By tricky I mean 'Good luck, you'll need it.' That isn't due to really clever encounters or well designed fights, that's due to enemies having vastly, MASSIVELY over inflated stat blocks and rule breaking amounts of special abilities, buffs and spells. That's one reason.

The second reason? just how stupidly pointlessly specific some of the quest outcomes are. Alright, fine. I'll admit it. Romances. The romance outcomes. There's a hidden romance in the game, that one's tricky. It should be. I have no issues with that. The others though? You can be going through the game, the character is professing their undying devotion, then later it turns out that fifty hours back you selected dialogue option 1. Feed the kitten. instead of dialogue option 2. [NEUTRAL GOOD] feed the kitten and now your characters lover has just thrown themselves into a volcano over it. if you check the achievements, that shows roughly 10% of players have finished the game. It also shows that 5% of players have managed to complete a romance. Considering how in games like this seeing your character get into a relationship is always a big part of peoples immersion, it kinda reinforces my point here.

Third reason I can't recommend this is the end game. It's the most miserable, dreary slog I've ever come across. Every single set of enemies there can either turn you to stone or blind you, permanently. Turns out there's a reason a lot of levelling up advice you see is along the lines of 'get blind fight'.",1696776002,1696781221,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Oh how I uhmed, oh how I ahhd.
Oh how I tried to love this game with every fibre of my being.
Based on a great series of sourcebooks from which I've drawn a lot of inspiration for my own campaign, it has an intriguing plot, a nice musical score, a wide variety of playstyles, lovable, memorable characters, a good sense of humor that has driven more than a few chuckles out of me and so, so much more.

But every praise I could lift up for this game is decisevily dwarfed by the simple fact that, as of now, it is not playable. Not enjoyably at least. I've now put over 120 hours into the game (which put a lot of strain on my nerves and vocal cords) and I have to face the bitter truth that I'm disappointed. I followed and supported the kickstarter and what I got as a result was an unbalanced mess. 

A difficulty curve best compared to an illegal rollercoaster, Game-breaking bugs that trap you in your own capital (a nice representation of the games underlying desire to keep you locked in your dusty throneroom and assign ministers for the rest of your life instead of exploring the vibrant world it gave you) ,  features like the Kingdom management becoming simply unmanageable after the 4th act, needlessly cryptic event descriptions that can mean live and death for your run, enemy designs that are BEYOND broken (Mid-level enemies that can tpk you with paralyze stunlock the second they see you, good one guys). 
The only way I found to beat this game was to break it back, use all the loopholes discussed on the forums and a rather peculiar amulet. But that sucks out the fun. And I'm not willing to do that
I'm sure there'll be patches along the way that'll smooth the ride, but for now I cannot recommend this game for anyone but the hardiest of veterans and those with a major sadistic streak.
Wanna tear your hair out about a character that fails a skill check of 23 despite having over 30 points in said skill?

Set in the enchanting and perilous Stolen Lands, this game challenges players to lead a group of adventurers and build their kingdom amidst political intrigue and mystical threats. As an enthusiastic fan who has savored the depth and grandeur of Pathfinder: Kingmaker's world, I'm eager to share my detailed review of this epic fantasy adventure.

Gameplay (9/10):
Pathfinder: Kingmaker adheres closely to the intricate ruleset of the tabletop Pathfinder RPG, offering deep character customization, challenging combat encounters, and a vast world to explore. The game's kingdom management system is a standout feature, requiring players to make strategic decisions that affect their realm's prosperity and stability. The game excels in offering multiple solutions to problems, allowing players to approach quests and challenges in a variety of ways. However, the sheer complexity of the mechanics can be overwhelming for newcomers to the Pathfinder system.

Storytelling (9/10):
The narrative of Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a grand and engaging epic, filled with political intrigue, mystical threats, and memorable characters. Players assume the role of a baron or baroness tasked with taming the Stolen Lands, and the choices they make throughout the game shape the fate of their burgeoning kingdom. The numerous companions each come with their own personalities, backgrounds, and quests, adding depth and emotional resonance to the story. The game's multiple branching paths and consequences for your choices ensure a high degree of replayability.

World-Building (10/10):
The Stolen Lands are brought to life with painstaking detail and a sense of grandeur. The world-building is a testament to the dedication of the developers, with diverse environments, hidden secrets, and a rich history to uncover. The game's lore is expansive, making exploration a rewarding experience. The diversity of regions and the sense of a living, breathing world contribute to the game's immersion.

Character Development (10/10):
Character development in Pathfinder: Kingmaker is one of its greatest strengths. The Pathfinder system allows for deep customization of your protagonist and companions, with a wealth of classes, abilities, and spells to choose from. The choices you make, both in character creation and during the game, shape the development of your party members and influence their individual stories and character arcs. The depth of character progression is a hallmark of the game, allowing players to create unique and powerful adventurers.

Graphics and Sound (8/10):
Pathfinder: Kingmaker's graphics are serviceable, with detailed character models and environments that capture the essence of the tabletop source material. While the graphics may not match the visual fidelity of more recent titles, they effectively convey the richness of the game's world. The orchestral soundtrack and atmospheric sound design add depth to the experience, immersing players in the grandeur of the Stolen Lands.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker has received praise for its faithfulness to the tabletop RPG system and its deep storytelling. It has contributed to the resurgence of CRPGs, showcasing the enduring appeal of complex, story-driven role-playing experiences in the modern gaming landscape.

My journey through the Stolen Lands in Pathfinder: Kingmaker has been an engrossing and highly replayable experience. Building my kingdom, forging alliances, and facing the challenges of the realm have provided hours of enjoyment. The depth of character development and the immersive world-building have made each playthrough feel fresh and engaging, making it a game that I continue to return to with enthusiasm.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a majestic and immersive RPG that brings the depth of the Pathfinder tabletop system to the digital realm. Its rich storytelling, world-building, and character development offer an epic and highly replayable fantasy adventure. While it may be daunting for newcomers to the Pathfinder system, it is a must-play for fans of deep, narrative-driven RPGs and those seeking to lead their own kingdom in a rich and vibrant fantasy world.",1696062523,1696062523,True,2,0,0.498006433248519897,0,True,False,False

구입하고 1시간도 못하고 어려워서 껐던건데, 발더스 게이트3 해보고 이해도가 생겨서 하고 평을 써봄.

일단 너무 crpg 매니아를 대상으로 만들어서 굉장히 불친절함.
최초 캐릭 만들때 아무것도 이해가 안됐었고, 동일한 D&D 파생을 해본 다음에야 이해를 할 수가 있었음.

전투가 기본적으로 재미가 없음
불필요한 전투를 줄이고 핵심적인 전투만 중요하게 나가면되는데, 의미없는 전투 반복이 너무 심함

실시간 전투는 물론 턴제 전투 모두 완성도가 낮음.
위에서 말했듯이 전투가 잦으니까 실시간으로 팍팍 밀게 만들려는거 같은데, 이도 저도 아닌 느낌임
턴제로 하려면 초반에 20면 주사위 판정이 굉장히 낮아서 공격 60%가 빗나감 떠서 타격감 조차 없음.

그럼에도 좋은 점을 준다면 crpg를 게임으로 구현하려는 노력이라는 점이고,
그러나 이마저도 디비니티에 밀려서 이도 저도 아닌 느낌.

640820,44975963,76561198011231411,0,77,6242,0,6242,1695952453,"I am a huge CRPG fan. I have played and finished most of the ones that exist with Baldur's Gate 2 being my favorite. I feel heavy hearted giving this one a thumbs down but I just couldn't. I respect the passion that went into this game, but passion isn't everything. You can see I have over 100 hours in this game but these hours are not consecutive. They represent me starting the game, playing for a few hours, then walking away from it for many months then returning and restarting. Only recently have I managed to put in a solid 40 hours straight and it was all done through gritted teeth. 

Here are my gripes. I'll be as constructive as possible:

1. The story is a slog. The main antagonist barely shows and the game is simply TOO wordy. By the 40th hour I was skipping whole swathes of dialogue because I simply didn't care anymore. There was so much irrelevant talking and the story is so convoluted that you never know what is or isn't relevant anymore. It feels like one of those 20 episode per season shows that only has 4 or 5 episodes that actually cover the main seasonal story arc.

2. The Kingdom management is simply hell. It felt like playing whack-a-mole. It's a cool idea with a lot of potential but feels like a poorly executed sim. People say you can set it to auto. I read about that and read that it causes a lot of glitches and bugs to occur so I didn't want to risk it. I set it to effortless and it's anything but. It feels like a full time job.

3. The map is huge and full of things to do. This feels awesome at first, but then it just gets exhausting, especially when each location is visually pretty samey. Couple this with the irritating fatigue mechanic that causes you to stop and rest every few steps, and it's just tedious. The fatigue mechanic feels pointless. Just feels like a tedious 30 second pause in my travels like a commercial or something. 

4. Turn based is slapped on. It slows the pace of an already slow paced game to an absolute crawl. Encountering one enemy triggers turn based, kill that enemy, walk 20 steps and meet another one. Turned based again. Eventually I turned it off completely only to feel like there's simply too much going on for me to make good use of the skills my party has. So I set it to the easiest difficulty and it then kind of just felt like a real time strategy game which is about as good as it gets. I know there are people out there who love the real time with pause but honestly I feel like it's overwhelming in this game.

5. My biggest issue: Time limits. The developers give us a huge world to explore then impose time limits. Horrible combination in my opinion. Couple that with the fact that most quests don't actually tell you there's a time limit. I'm not talking about the first one that gives you a ton of time to finish, but all these smaller ones like companion quests. Sometimes I don't feel like dropping what I'm doing and traveling to the other end of the map for a companion I don't even use that often. I feel like in the dev's quest for realism, they forgot about fun.

I got to the part where you go to Pitax for a fair, but honestly I just couldn't do it anymore. I felt like I was wading through it just because it's a CRPG and because I own the sequel for some reason but I finally got fed up. I'm not really sure who the target audience for this game is, but as an old school CRPG fan, I'm not really feeling this one.

1. Go turn-based mode. I played 100 hours in real time then made the change, I just regret taking so long to play it in TB.

2. Negative effects like losing levels, losing attribute points, blindness are EXTREMELY common, the first two can break all your characters in a dungeon and dungeons tend to be long. DELAY POISON, restoration spells, remove sickness, remove cruse and remove blindness/blind fighter are ESSENTIAL, or you can set to remove all negative effects on rest, thats what I do, just got real tired of all that shit.

3. The main, companion and some other quests are time sensitive and some are hard game over. Travelling around the world takes time, you might discover that you are a few in-game hours short of reaching a quest location before it fails.

I can totally understand where the hates come from and in fact I agree to most of them. Many game mechanisms are just annoying, unbalancing and unforgiving rather than fun, and not every player who loves CRPG can tolerate it. For example, the pure RNG mechanism is somewhat broken in early game; a d20 dice in initiative roll may just ruin your effort in DEX investment. This scares away a lot of players who want to play games for relaxation but not for angry.

There are endless combat encounters. And dungeons are set up to be as long as possible with sprawling maps that are filled to the brim with enemies and traps. The game’s obsessive need to throw you into combat is exhausting. And the game utterly leans into being completely sadistic with the combat design. CRPGs are notorious for being difficult games with challenging combat scenarios, but this game takes it to a whole other level with it being well and truly hostile to the player. It wants you to fail at every turn. It wants you to spend inordinate amounts of time buffing your characters. It wants you to have to constantly engage in the most irritating implementation of resting in any CRPG I've ever played. The game just wants to be as vindictive and troublesome as it can be at every turn.

If you took out all of the combat, you would be left with a game that is honestly ridiculously barebones for an RPG. There’s shockingly little narrative in relation to the combat. And a lot of the narrative just serves to set up another combat encounter. Obviously this game is based upon a Pathfinder module and I’m not really familiar with it, but it spends way too much time focusing on combat over a story with substance. 

Various events occur in the game with some just feeling like they are completely arbitrary and designed solely to create tension or drama that’s unearned. Betrayals that are completely out of the blue and only haphazardly explained. So much of it feels like you’re railroaded into a path that really doesn’t feel earned or rewarding to be in. 

The whole conceit of you becoming the ruler of a land and all that it entails just doesn’t feel explored well at all. Most of the time I just felt like a regular adventurer with a title that happened to carry some influence. I didn’t really feel like I was a ruler engaging in high level politicking. There’s too many things that occur in the background that feel oddly abstracted from your experience, yet at the same time you’re forced to interact with all these tedious management tasks. In fact, you are mostly ruler in name only because when it counts the NPCs and the world totally disavows any of your agency and power. People will literally threaten you in your throne room and there's naught you can do about it. And yet when it doesn't matter, when it comes to managerial tedium, you are suddenly the #1 gal for the job. So all the work of being a ruler and none of the fun.

The central narrative just feels too disjointed, too disconnected, and does too little to excite interest in it. I would often quit the game repeatedly because I just grew so bored and disinterested in doing what I was doing. Why am I fighting all the battles? For some sliver of story that only propels me into the next battle? This game fails to live up to its forebears. I have loved countless CRPGs over the years with Baldur’s Gate 2 being my favorite of all time and this game simply does not come close to them. It’s a pale imitation.

The allies you amass as you play the game are not compelling in the slightest with the exception of only a couple and even their stories are not particularly enthralling. The characters mostly consist of caricatures that fail to be more than that. And you will struggle to care about any of them or their issues. Of the companions, I’d say Harrim offers the most intriguing narrative and even if you dislike him as a person, his pathos is at least interesting to explore. 

While on the subject of companions, the game springs romances on you in the most bizarre manner. I had no idea I was the object of a character’s romance until I was very suddenly pressed into a romantic situation. And then the character declares their love for me. Nothing had even remotely occurred to build to that. It was just thrust out there. 

There were parts of it I enjoyed. There were times in which I found it compelling. Yet at the same time I cannot deny that the game just feels like I’m playing a Pathfinder combat simulator with only the husk of an RPG attached to it. There’s just too much combat and not enough story or at least not a good enough story to justify a good review for the game. I put almost 50 hours into this game and I kept trying to make it to the end, but I just can't do it. I hate this game. I hate so much about it. And I cannot begin to conceive how people could ever utter Baldur's Gate and Kingmaker in the same breath as if the latter is in any way, shape, or form close to the former. And I think the fact that less than 10% of people have beaten the game is pretty telling about its quality and the sheer grinding nature of the game itself.",1695165415,1695246125,False,5,0,0.539230883121490479,0,True,False,False

I played the game in turn-based mode, and can’t speak much of the real-time-with-pause mode. It’s nice that you have the option, though.

First, the good. It's simply a great implementation of turn-based strategy. There's tons of customization, and the game allows you to respec your character and your companions relatively freely (for in-game currency, but it's affordable). You can also hire other characters that you design from scratch, which I absolutely love. Other games like Pillars of Eternity have tons of subclasses and races, but you're stuck making a single character, and will never explore most of the options in a single playthrough. This game gives you the freedom to try different builds, combos, and team compositions, and switch out or change what isn't working. That's easily my favorite part of the game.

I like the plot and writing, too. There’s a lot of choice at almost every single story beat, ranging from minor to major decisions, and they’re fun to contemplate. All decisions are labeled unambiguously as “Good”, “Lawful”, “Evil”, “Chaotic”, etc., which removes from of the nuance of decisionmaking when you’re explicitly told what’s “Good” and what’s not. (Granted, this is necessary for the alignment system, so I’ll let it slide.) Overall, the writing is a positive for me.

Unfortunately, as much as I enjoy this game, it has some problems. I’ll be nice and call them “Quirks”.

Quirk 1: Crowd Control
The worst offender here is fear/frightening effects, but it’s not the only one. This game has a ton of “save-or-suck” effects, where the target fails a single save, and is then subjected to that effect for a duration. This duration can be long- anywhere from four to ten rounds, which is often an entire encounter. These effects are brutal. Most stop that character from acting altogether, many are difficult and inconsistent to cure or remove, and a bunch of them are AOE. If three or four members of your party get frightened on the first turn, you probably just lose the fight then and there.
A healthier version of crowd control is where the target can try to break free every turn. These effects are present in this game, and, in my opinion, should be far more prevalent than their “save-or-suck” cousins.

Quirk 2: Ability Damage
Sometimes, an enemy will be able to reduce your stats. If a ghost hits you, for example, you might take a -2 penalty to Strength. These penalties are healed at a rate of 1 per day. So, after 2 days, the penalty is gone. Fine, on paper.
The problem is that Ability Damage is far, far too prevalent and obnoxious to remove. One of my characters once walked into an encounter without any Ability Damage at all, and then walked out with a -26 penalty to Strength. Do you seriously expect me to return home, and press “Sleep” on the bed twenty-six times in a row, to remove the debuff from a single fight in a dungeon? That isn’t engaging difficulty, it’s just a chore.
There are some spells and abilities that remove Ability Damage, but they’re limited and uncommon. Mercifully, there’s a difficulty setting that makes resting cure all debuffs. That definitely cranks the difficulty down and you might want to make other changes to compensate, but it’s absolutely worth it in my opinion.

Quirk 3: Bugs
I usually don’t like to complain about bugs, but I have to mention it briefly. My first playthrough was completely soft-locked due to a main story quest that became impossible to complete. I ran into a kingdom quest that was impossible to complete because I was using a custom mercenary, and it only worked when I used a normal companion. Most of the Bard's ""performance"" abilities turn off automatically after combat is over, but ""Inspire Greatness"" never does for some reason. I’m usually willing to overlook minor bugs, but I don’t think it would be an honest review if I didn’t mention that my first playthrough was completely broken, forcing me to restart the whole game.

Thankfully, this game has some excellent difficulty options! You can choose enemy stats, how powerful their abilities can be, and how much damage they do to the party. You can customize the rules for death, debuffs, and more. So if you turn off permadeath or allow all curses to be removed on rest (like I did) you can compensate with other challenges to keep combat interesting. If it weren’t for this inclusive difficulty menu, I probably wouldn’t have played anywhere near as much as I did, and this review probably wouldn’t be a positive one.

In conclusion, I think this is a very fun game with satisfying combat, good writing, and a metric ton of customization, but if suffers from some difficulty spikes and frustrating mechanics.

Starting from you miss most of the time event if you have a +6 attack roll bonus, equipping two weapons even if you have a negative attack roll bonus yields more results since you at least roll 2 hit dice, so even if the roll sucks at least you have multiple attempts. The only useful spell so far was grease and the melee thunder thing.

Overall, it would have been a good game, since it has a good story + kingdom management mechanics, but this game loves wasting my time, and I'm just on normal difficulty. You always feel that the AI has some sort of advantage even though it says in the ""stats"" that they don't. I always encounter enemies who are 1 or 2 levels higher than me.

This game have some potential, but they better improve that dice mechanic. Why even have that dice roll when in other games they don't depend on such things anymore. I get it from a DnD perspective but this is a computer game, not a tabletop game. Dice rolls were added in table top games because it makes sense in such setting, but not here.

First thing, the game is long. I restarted once as I wasn't happy with things and i think I had played or something like 32 hours so I would say it took me around 136 hours and that was doing everything (I think I even got the ""true ending"" against the ""true"" final boss) so be prepared for a very long adventure.

The game has pacing and balance issues.  I would say for the first 8ish levels, the game was pretty tough and I was playing on Normal.  It was probably one of the toughest games I've played - I may not be familiar with Pathfinder or a D & D player (other than cRPGs), but I like to think I've played enough to say that it is tougher in comparison.  However, like I said, the difficulty mostly went away when I was around level 8 or so (though I did have Jubilost and Kalikke in the party who are pretty strong from what I've read) with only a few bosses that gave problems.  Then, comes the end game when you start facing the Wild Hunt and the difficulty ramped up. Honestly, after 110ish hours, I was just tired of that and looking to just play for the story so I just used the Bag of Tricks mod to basically give god mode (no damage from enemies, make all checks, etc.). Buffs are pretty important, but they also get pretty tedious to apply (less so as you level up and they last longer).

The pacing also ties to being overwhelming, See, not only do you have to pay attention to things like regular AC and touch AC (with different attacks targeting it and some foes having one higher than the other), but also foes like Swarm which are incredibly hard to hit (use magic) or lots of debilitations (ability score damage, blindness, etc.) which I honestly just had the game set to restore on rest...  Then, you have the fact that there are timers in the game. You have a kingdom to manage with timers. Your quests (at least main ones) have timers.  You actually should have plenty of time (I think I explored everywhere, mapped the world, and did everything by the end), but you need to know what to do.  You start off with a quest to defeat the Stag Lord in 90 days which is plenty, then you have trolls invading, etc.  It's scary and annoying, yet do those quests (and areas around) and it's not too bad. Then, you get to Chapter 5ish and all of a sudden you get like 200ish days to work on things and by the last chapter, you are just wanting to hurry up to end game (at least I was).

Kingdom Management is a thing where if it isn't auto, you have to do well or you fail the game.  I honestly both like and dislike things like this.  It's a nice diversion for me, but at the same time I can't shake the feeling the time and resources would be better spent on the rest of the game.  You claim territories, build settlements, and recruit crafters who give you nice items.  However, other than the items you get, it feels like it didn't really matter.  The buildings only really seem there to help solve events and don't actually show up.  You can ""evolve"" your settlements, but your Capital only changes when you get to a City and not much.  The difficulty of the events didn't seem to be impacted by the difficulty slider.  The endings seemed very... arbitrary? Like, you just couldn't get a happy ending.  Oh, you did well in your Community? Well, guess what?  a province has rebelled which makes no sense given what happens in the game.  Like, if that didn't make them leave, I don't see them leaving in a time of peace and prosperity.  Still, I wouldn't go auto because it was nice. If nothing else, use the Bag of Tricks mod. You can set it so you auto-succeed all events and even so all events only take one day (it says instantly, but you must still wait one day to re-assign the advisor).

Overall, I was fine with the writing. There were ups and downs which shouldn't be surprising in a massive game.  I did encounter a few bugs (items disappearing, graphic issues, mispellings) which won't get fixed (the devs lost rights to the game and it seems it was too massive or not popular enough for unofficial patches).

There's probably more I could write to help someone decide if a 100+ hour game is write, but the problem with a 100+ hour game is it's hard to think of everything (or have the room to write such a review).",1694572724,1694572724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the positive side, the game's adherence to the Pathfinder tabletop rules is commendable. It captures the essence of classic tabletop role-playing, offering deep character customization, complex party management, and intricate storytelling. Fans of the Pathfinder tabletop game will appreciate the attention to detail and the faithfulness to the source material.

However, the game's slow pacing is a double-edged sword. While some players may relish the deliberate and methodical progression, others may find it tedious and plodding. The initial hours of the game, especially, demand patience as players engage in lengthy conversations, navigate intricate menus, and perform repetitive tasks. This measured approach can be immersive for those who enjoy intricate world-building and meticulous decision-making but might be a turn-off for players seeking a more fast-paced experience.

Furthermore, the slow pacing extends to the combat system, which can feel ponderous and occasionally bogged down by mechanics that may not translate well to a digital format. Turn-based combat encounters can be time-consuming, and managing a party of characters can become overwhelming, leading to drawn-out battles that may test the patience of some players.

In summary, ""Pathfinder: Kingmaker"" is a game that demands a specific kind of player—one who relishes intricate world-building, deep storytelling, and methodical decision-making. Its slow pace can be a strength for those seeking a rich and immersive RPG experience but a hindrance for those accustomed to more fast-paced gameplay.

The art for the characters is great, just wish they were presented a lot closer to their portraits ingame.

Soundtrack is bland without any memorable tracks. The cartoony graphics really aren't for me. The combat is fine but its not really something that stands out or does anything better than its peers in the genre. Also, the spellcasters have no main equiptable weapon types, why?

A lot of lore (if new to Pathfinder)
Cons:
Start of the game on hard and above is a bit of challenge for first run(especially in dungeon with spiders)
Timers. Before you will get an idea how to deal with them, your main campaign will be messed up (Up to the point when i have killed the boss,  but kingdom failed after dialogue with him)

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the first CRPG adaptation set in the world of Pathfinder and also a game that quickly became known as one of the best modern CRPGs.
The game takes place in the Stolen Lands, a wild region of the world where civilization hasn't been seen in a very long time. Through a series of events, you will have the chance to become the ruler of these wild lands and slowly turn them towards a better future. During you adventures, you'll meet many companions of different races and backgrounds, each with a whole questline of their own. They will help you withstand the test of time and prove you're the rightly ruler of Stolen Lands.
The main story of the game is pretty solid, like you would expect from a CRPG. Beside the ""usual"" questing and dungeon crawling, there is a strategic aspect of the game. Once you actually claim the first region of the Stolen Lands, you'll be able to build various buildings and research all sorts of upgrades. Your companions can also be named as advisors and ministers, allowing them a role in the strategic part of the game as well. As a system, Pathfinder is very similar to DnD, but with some crucial differences. Personally, I really like it, as do most veteran DnD players who tried playing it. It might be a little too much for a beginner though, as it features tons of complicated effects and spells. As a game, Pathinder successfully incorporates some of the ideas borrowed from other CRPGs. The whole strategic/building aspect of the game comes from Pillars of Eternity series, along with the comic-stlye encounters with choices, while camping and food is an idea borrowed from the Expeditions series. But as I said, Pathfinder implements these very nicely. One thing I have to mention - this game is way harder than other games of its type. Just to give you an example - Divinity or PoE on the hardest possible difficulty is a gentle breeze compared to 'Hard' in Pathfinder. Luckily, there are bunch of difficulty settings to customize your adventure just the way you want it.
As far as CRPG games go, Pathfinder:Kingmaker is HUGE. There are like a hundred locations in the game, some of which contain multi-level dungeons. While I'm usually thrilled by a prospect of an epic RPG which I can play for hundreds of hours, it literally took me over 350 hours for a single playthrough. The game just isn't interesting enough to keep you occupied for all that time and I found myself quite bored while playing the last 50 hours or so. Also, the game is very buggy. As I understand, it was practically unplayable when it fist got out due to bugs, but the devs managed to fix most of them. Well I can't even imagine how it was before those fixes, because the game is still seriously plagued by all kinds of bugs.
For me, Pathfinder: Kingmaker was an enjoyable game. Despite its impressive collection of bugs and the sheer lenght of the main story, I still had quite a bit of fun. It's a true role-playing experience that I would recommend to every lover of the genre.

TL;DR: It's like having a really nice meal and the worst ever dessert afterwards, but then they remind you that the real food was the friends you made along the way and that kinda brings a tear to your eye.

Despite its many flaws, this is easily one of my favourite RPGs ever. I came into this experience a D&D 3.5 virgin and the game tore me a new asshole, leaving me a grizzled whore (Pathfinder is just ""we have D&D at home""). Even on the normal/""balanced"" difficulty the amount of times I got absolutely destroyed was crazy, but it was a really good time because this game probably has the best implementation of the tabletop mechanics in a video game. Well, the first 110 hours were - then we get to the last chapter/s where everything is a raid boss and you need to have the right buffs. Unless you are omniscient, you're going to have an awful time. Luckily (with the help of a couple of useful guides or lots of trial and error) you can figure it out, but it is still tedious because it is the same damn combat encounter over and over and over and over again. It's a rather common problem with late game D&D, because your party becomes so powerful that only insanely OP enemies can provide a challenge, but did that challenge really need to be done so many times? Apart from that, the combat was incredible and the character builds are probably the best in the genre by quite some distance. 

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the story. Golarion might be a knock off Forgotten Realms, but it is a damn good one and does enough to make it interesting in its own ways. The main enemy was a really interesting one and not one that is often used in fantasy video games (because of just how over the top it is, even by fantasy standards). When there is so much of it, not all the writing is going to be incredible, but the good parts scratched all my cheesy fantasy spots in the right way. The characters were really likeable and there was a good variety of dumb and fun, dark and edgy, politics and scheming and just good old fashioned adventuring.Supporting it all the way through is a nice 3D art style (with beautiful character portraits) and a really solid fantasy soundtrack. Although the end-game combat sucked mega ass, the actual story was great and left me feeling satisfied (somehow I got lucky and fulfilled the requirements for the secret ending). It is a testament to the writing that it could salvage the absolute atrocity of the final(ish) dungeon.

The kingdom management is hit and miss. My Pavlovian response to it (thanks Ubisoft and EA) was that it was just a tacked on gimmick and therefore I didn't put a lot of effort into it. Come Chapter 5 I almost lost my 100 hour game because apparently it is actually really important (imagine that). Thankfully I could just turn down the difficulty setting to ""never lose the game because of this mechanic"", but I do wish I paid more attention to it from the beginning because it's actually fairly decent. It's cool to see your barony grow into a full on kingdom even if the actual mechanics are just dice rolls. By far not the game's strongest aspect, but it definitely was actually a thought out and important element instead of just something tacked on for the sake of it.

I really enjoyed the Varnhold's Lot DLC and it added a lot to my play through (although it was kinda funny/sad to see my character from that adventure become a punching bag for the late game enemies when she appeared to ""help out""). What I did not enjoy (along with everyone else) was the Kickstarter backer quest. Some dude paid a shit ton of money to put the cringiest and most instantly detestable character ever in an RPG in the game and had the audacity to portray him as a hero. It was a ""so bad it's funny"" kind of situation, but my God was it bad. Tiger, however, was amazing and I hope the little guy is catching butterflies in kitty heaven. From this fan service (questionable as that awful quest may be) and the opening message thanking the fans and families of the developers for making the game possible, I get the idea that Owlcat are a really great studio with their hearts in the right place. Kingmaker was extremely ambitious and it it's amazing how well they managed to pull it off (apparently the game was rough at launch, but it was in a decent place when I played it). Looking forward to playing WotR to see the improvements and the upcoming 40k Rouge Trader will be a day 1 purchase for me, because I feel like if they can keep working on the foundations I saw here, we may finally get the 40k RPG we have always needed. 

Despite my overall positive experience, I will never touch this game again, because
a) PotR is just Kingmaker, but new and improved.
b) I do not ever want to see the final parts of this game again. Seriously, fuck that dungeon and its obscure puzzles guarded by never ending hordes of raid bosses.",1693400839,1693519174,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The good, this is a solid CRPG, with a lot of classes (even more variations with mods), lots of races, good story, loads of dialog which a lot of is voice acted and is decent, the environment is gorgeous, characters are well made with their own personality.

So why it became frustrating? Well for me the main reason was the timers on the quests. Every time I wanted a break and focus a bit on the side quest I was met with a timer on the main quest which prompts a “game over” if left unchecked, this is simply left me whit little time to fully develop the kingdom I wanted, do side stories and so on, basically I just wanted a break from time to time from the main quests.
Lets get to the second gripe, the encounters. Much of the combat was alright, but like I said at first, the more the worse it got. Near the end of the game, I was bombarded with encounters after encounters, barely any room to breathe, no more side stuff to do, just fight your way to the bosses, compared to the rest of the game where you had plenty of things to do. What can I say, a disappointing end game. Also regarding encounters, they felt unbalanced, you often end up with highlevel enemies for low level quests and areas, so often you gotta ignore quests until you get a higher level. Enemies seem to just roll crits and applied effects up the ass, while your party is a constant miss and failed to cast, some even have special resistances which you need to use a certain weapons or spells, without them you cannot finish them, so if you end up with an enemy weak to only cold steel weapons and you got none cuz they are useless outside those fights, you gonna need a reload. 

And lets say you do win, you can still be left with permanent debufs/curses, which take expansive scrolls or high level magic to clean, so yeah, you can still be left scared and punished for wining, why could they just not make them have a long timer and if you had the means you could cure them up to speed up the process, I dunno. Ohh and it can end up really bad if your healers/casters, which can use the scrolls/magic to cure, end up themselves with a perma polymorph rendering them unable to do anything, times like that sure are fun…

I was praising the wide amount of classes/skills but that is also an issue, since only a bunch of combinations are actually viable in combat, with the fact that it costs money to reset specs and money are not easy to make (you should get a mod which makes it free) and you cannot really try out various combs to see what works. 

In the end it has a disappointing ending zone (getting through it is just a gauntlet of encounters), unbalanced enemies/encounters, timed quests which result in a insta game over, bad kingdom managing system.
All in all, I recommend it to play it with mods which make the experience tolerable (some of it), but especially I recommend it only if you finished Pillars of Eternity, Divinity OS, Baldur’s Gate, maybe even old ones like Icewind Dale, no wonder the achievement for winning the game was completed by only 9% of players, it gets bad the more you play but enjoyable enough, get the complete edition in a sale.",1693168852,1693168852,False,1,0,0.48466336727142334,0,True,False,False

If you don't want to spend $60 but can find it in your heart to drop $20, buy this game. If you are either interested in or preferential to the Pathfinder ruleset (or D&D 3.5), buy this game. If you like bright colors, vibrant animation, and heartfelt characters, all locked in a dark, and gruesome storyline, buy this game.

I personally have spent many hours in game just admiring the love and effort that was put into a game competing with the likes of Divinity Original Sin, Neverwinter Nights, even Baldur's Gate! One thing that BG3 boasts, that Kingmaker did first was having your rests actually require increasingly high skill checks, and/or specific resources (that are cheap, but very heavy). Also, the game has a great sense of urgency, meaning that you might have to make the decision between helping one of your friends, going on a luxurious dungeon raid, or saving the kingdom in one of three ways, which is good for us poor excuses of adventurers! Keeps our minds and hearts moving!

The only downfalls I can see that this game has are as follows:

a) Lack of fully-voiced character.

It is quite saddening, to me, when the main characters of the game speak half of their lines, and the rest have to be read. Maybe you can imagine the voices yourself, or maybe it doesn't bother you at all. But for me, voiced characters, especially in a game like this, are very important.

b) Extremely high skill level and punishment. 

I'll be honest; Pathfinder: Kingmaker is freaking hard. It is just a hard game. Monsters hit brutally, and are difficult to hit. Skill checks fail often, causing either group damage or missed opportunities. It isn't uncommon for your barony to come close to failure, either because of your own choices or priorities, or because of a couple bad dice rolls.

If it is your first time playing the Pathfinder ruleset, play on the the first two difficulties, else you find yourself quitting, save-scumming, or spending three times as long as you should in every scenario. If you are a novice or intermediate player, or even quite experienced- there is no shame at all in lowering the difficulty, or just changing some specific settings to make your time in-game more enjoyable. I for one, never, ever, let the party's weight affect movement speed. It makes it impossible to either have enough money, or accomplish any tasks. I just play it how I like. 

Also, kingdom management is not for the feint-of-heart. It will take lots of time, and be very resource consuming. Don't rush through it, unless you've finished the Vanishing of Varnhold and have 200k to spend on BP.

c) Some poor designer choices.

There are just some things that I feel are in poor taste. To name a few, showing all of the alignment-specific options, instead of only the ones that apply, not letting you retry a failed lock-picking check and forcing you to only use your main pc, and not making visible recognition of romances until it happens. There are other quality-of-life issues, but I can't think of them all.

Overall, it's a good game. 10/10 would recommend!",1693148827,1693148827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is nice, your choices shape the world and have a direct impact on what is happening around you. There's a nice selection of characters, and they have depth, bags of personality and nice background stories, it was easy to become attached to some of them and I liked the immersion. The voice acting is nice too.
Gameplay for me was mixed. The kingdom management came as a surprise, I didn't like it at all, and stuck it on auto mode so I could focus on exploration and questing, which I enjoyed. After a while, travelling around the map gets tedious as hell, and there is no way to speed it up without mods.
The combat and equipment system is extremely complicated. If you've never played Pathfinder, D&D or other  tabletop games, you're going to struggle. I remember a very brief explanation of the system at the start of the game, but it's too early to take anything in, and is given without examples. This meant I didn't understand how to use the equipment, spells and potions properly, or who should be equipped with what gear, and for this reason normal gameplay was way too hard. I dropped the difficulty down to story mode, and even then some battles were hard as hell. The final parts of the game were horrendous... i'm looking at you, Wriggling Man. I had to look up how to beat this guy, and it turns out a lot of people had major problems here. 
Once I had completed the game, I got a rare achievement for beating the final boss and only 8% of people have it. This speaks volumes. Not sure whether people got bored as it's very long, or simply found it too hard, but either way the lack of tutorials, explanations and fast travel really hindered my experience.
It wasn't the worst classic i've played, but nowhere near the best. Give it a try if you're a fan of tabletop stuff, there's a good chance you'll like it... it's just not beginner friendly at all.",1693094229,1693094229,True,9,0,0.634226739406585693,0,True,False,False

I do recommend using a few mods, though some of them will make the game trivial if you are apt to use the cheats.  Things like faster movement and adjusting carrying capacity do make the game better in my opinion.

With my ice magic at the ready, I delved into the world of Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition. And oh, what a journey it was!

The Tale Begins

From the moment I set my paws on this game, I was transported to a realm reminiscent of the classics like Baldur's Gate and Fallout. The Stolen Lands beckoned, and with the guidance of the renowned Narrative Designer Chris Avellone and the melodies of composer Inon Zur, I was ready to conquer and make it my own.

The Kingdom Awaits

The Stolen Lands, a territory that has seen the rise and fall of countless kingdoms, now awaited my rule. But ruling wasn't just about power; it was about diplomacy, politics, and managing the intricacies of a kingdom. Every decision I made, every ally I chose, and every enemy I faced had a direct impact on my kingdom. It was a living entity, reflecting my choices and leadership.

Character Customization: A Furry's Dream

The depth of character customization was like a dream come true. I could channel my inner wolf, choosing from a plethora of classes, powers, and abilities. The game allowed me to be the hero (or villain) I wanted to be, tailoring my character to both my gameplay style and my furry personality.

Companions: Trust and Betrayal

The diverse cast of companions added layers to the narrative. Trust was a luxury, and every companion came with their own motives and agendas. Their stories intertwined with mine, making the journey even more personal.

The Challenges

However, every kingdom has its challenges. From managing resources to defending against threats, both internal and external, the game tested my leadership skills at every turn. The kingdom management system was intricate, requiring strategic thinking and foresight.

The Verdict

Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition is a masterpiece in the world of RPGs. With its rich narrative, deep character customization, and challenging kingdom management, it offers an immersive experience that is hard to match.

Pros:

    Deep character customization allowing for a unique furry experience.
    Engaging storyline with twists and turns.
    Intricate kingdom management system.
    Diverse cast of companions adding depth to the narrative.

Cons:

    Some challenges can be overwhelming for new players.
    Requires strategic thinking and planning.

In the icy world of HowlStrom, where magic and adventure intertwine, Pathfinder: Kingmaker stands as a beacon of excellence in the realm of RPGs. As Kiba Snowpaw, the Ice Alpha Wolf with a passion for gaming, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to all RPG enthusiasts, furry or not.

May your adventures be as thrilling as mine, and may the icy winds of HowlStrom guide you on your journey.

There is so much good content in this game, but that is offset by wild swings in difficulty and poorly explained mechanics. I intensely disliked this game for the first 5 hours, but once I understood how the game wanted you to play, I couldn't stop playing it.

If you are a fan of Infinity Engine or Real Time with Pause CRPGs, this is one of the best implementations of that combat system I've experienced. The actual flow of combat and character customization is amazing, but keep in mind that the Pathfinder system will not hold your hand through character development. I had to sit down and read class descriptions and skills for about 10-15 minutes each character just to figure out the intended development path. Some classes are very straightforward, while some, like the Magus, are hybrids of a couple character archetypes.

The story is fairly compelling with some great twists and turns. However, there were some moments, particularly with a few romance paths that I felt were done poorly or made me a bit uncomfortable. The actual main quest is generally well written and I felt involved as multiple crises were attacking my kingdom. One thing to note is that the actual narrative is very long. You're not going to be able to finish this game in 40 hours like most other games. Just make sure to do the main act quests FIRST before you do any side areas. This is kind of opposite from how other CRPGs are set up. If you delay the main quests too long, your kingdom will collapse. There will be plenty of time to do side areas and kingdom management between acts.

Overall I would recommend this game to any CRPG fans, but I would highly suggest you use a guide for the kingdom management and character recruitment portions of this game. It's entirely possible to get trapped in a death spiral with the kingdom management mode and there's not really an indication on what you did wrong to get into this position. Personally I try to play games without strategy guides for the first playthrough, but this is one game where you will need to look things up to progress effectively. Keep in mind that the game has a very customizable difficulty setting, so you can outright disable many of the more bothersome aspects of the game if you wish (or just use mods).",1692546123,1692546123,True,15,0,0.652241408824920654,0,True,False,False

Seriously. The first opportunity you get to talk to them all three of them give you the same spiel about how they hated the men at home and how giving birth to children and having families was below them.
I'm kind of disgusted with the characters - or the writers I guess.

Even with running a simple build that would work in almost any other cRPG game I find myself running into insane difficulty spikes out of no where, and without proper investment into niche spells, and having two clerics at all times you will find yourself running into a slow tedious grind as you get through the late game. I want to like this game as the beginning is so much fun, but as you enter mid to late game you start to see that there is a right way to build your characters and creative freedom goes out the door. You can respec at anytime, but I found myself just then just following an optimal build to be able to get through the game. Its basically a needlessly more complex Divinity, but with more tedium and fun sucking enemies that slows dungeon crawling to a halt, and might lead you to reloading an earlier save just so you can respec so you can be prepared to get swarmed by new enemies with permanent stat debuffs or level draining standard attacks. I learned to have a full stack of restoration scrolls and half my inventory full of rations to be able to rest off the negative status effects that last for 24h in game. A play through on normal will ultimately result in frustration unless you follow a guide and build according to pre-established routes, and then the fun of the game is completely lost. I want to like this game, but I always just find myself frustrated by the end of playing it. I would give it a solid 6/10. Solid potential, with some major tweaks it could be a great game, but the tedium and the difficulty balance being completely off, without a guide or prior knowledge you will find this game more frustration than fun.",1692428918,1692428918,False,4,0,0.535962879657745361,0,True,False,False

If you are willing to learn this game is a great role playing game where you choices affect the world around you with multiple ways of dealing with a quest. Some regions are rough or tedious but it really does give it that feeling of an adventure. Not everything is smooth sailing also this game is fairly long for a single player game and I wanted more character interactions outside of their dedicated quests. The replacement character portraits on nexus mods is great some good quality art. Also if you get weird semi-unique looking items with unusual descriptions keep an eye out for any odd locations or interactions within the same map. Sometimes odd empty boxes or chests or storage containers want you to actually leave an item inside them for a small bonus. This isn't always told to you explicitly and sometimes you'll only have to look at the context clues of your surroundings to understand. I can see many places where players could get stuck or give up on a playthrough but again this is an adventure it isn't always meant to be a smooth experience and i think its okay for rpg games to have these odd spikes in difficulty. If you do start a playthrough watch youtube videos on classes and general tips there are so many classes in this game. Took me about 150 hours to do 99% of what this game has to offer (got lazy towards the end because I wanted to make another character with a different build). Honestly I save scummed alot this game and you should too but if you didn't get exactly the dialogue dice roll you wanted or maybe you accidentally dismissed an artisan and you can't get them back, just roll with it.

В ней есть как и весьма недурные моменты, так и настолько ужасные геймдизайнерские решения, что моё потенциальное желание перепройти под конец угасло окончательно. Хотя мб оно и к лучшему, ибо я бы точно ещё более критично о ней отозвался.

Сразу хочу сказать, что боевка и презентация боевки - это лучшее, что есть в игре.
Звуки драки, особенно критов заставляют мои пропёрженные стринги мокреть. Это немногим хуже, чем сочные убийства в фаллауте. И такому импакту звуковику нужно научить кретинов, которые делают современные шутеры.
+ пошаговый режим, в который так легко переключаться - это великолепная идея, с великолепной реализацией. Одна из тех вещей, которая двигает жанр вперёд.

Визуально всё тоже выглядит сочно, графика неплохая, а для инди-кала на юнити - так тупа топ. Хотя и красивых задников в ней мало, технологичность картинки вытягивает это упущение.

Ещё один безусловный плюс - это последствия от принятых решений. Некоторые из них тянутся через всю игру, некоторые просто возникают спустя несколько глав, мол, гляди что ты сделал. Это очень сильно накидывает баллов игре, хоть таких моментов и не супер много.

Так же мне в целом понравились напарники, именно их персонажи. Но при этом они одновременно и разочаровывают: ростер небольшой, они очень слабо ""участвуют"" в игре, если не назначать их на советников. С ними достаточно мало диалогов(вот только в начале тебе дают 8-9 фраз, а потом ты с ними общаешься раза 3, когда у них квесты появляются), изредка они что-то вякнут в диалоге и...всё. А ещё половина классов в игре не задействована у напарников, что тоже странно. Хотя для напарников в игре 2 жреца и 2 роги.

Это из хорошего.


Из плохого.... в игре слишком много дерьмовых элементов. прям отборно дерьмовых, дерьмовейших, кошмарных.

Я изначально не понимал, почему многим не зашло строительство королевства, ибо крутая же идея, я люблю такое. Особенно с учетом того, что последствия выборов и мировоззрение влияет и на вид королевства, и на советников, и на возможные постройки. Но сейчас понимаю. Это бесполезно, неудобно и это уныло. Под конец кубики настолько неадекватные, что даже замакшенные статы королевства имеют шансы 16-40%. Постоянно возникает какая-то залупа, которая может заруинить прохождение. Благо, авторы сами знают, что они сделали что-то неработающее и сделали галочки, которые позволяют не запариваться насчёт королевства, либо запрещают мгновенное принятие ислама.

К слову о кубиках, тут совсем всё печально. В игре всё завязано на этих ебланских кубиках. От усталости на карте, до обнаружения локаций на той же карте. Прежде чем посрать, геймдизайнер тоже кубики бросает, небось, и если выпадает 1 - то у него спонтанно возникает анальная трещина. Это абсолютно тупое говно тупого говна. Бесило бы ещё не так сильно при условии, что сохранения и загрузки бы длились меньше двух минут. Но юнити жэш.

Далее прокачка и система шмота: фанаты конечно могут быть не согласны, но мне все равно.
""Билдов"" тут мало. Всё сводится к тому, что ты уга буга сильно бьешь, или сильно бьешь под яростью, или сильно бьешь под бафом, или сильно бьешь сник атаками, или сильно бьешь, ударив заклинанием с касанием. Вот прям, чтоб как в пилларсах, где билдов миллион и они все играбельны - тут не сделать. Тупо нет шмота, и фитов(хотя их раз в 10 больше, чем в пое 1 и 2 суммарно)

Про шмот - его непозволительно мало, настолько мало, что я ощущал себя цыганом, который использует презерватив 10 лет и стирает его в стиралке.
Авторы сделали ~30-40классов оружия(хз сколько точно) и 90% этого оружия имеют меньше 3х шмоток. А зачем?
Я за игру не нашел ни одного уникального арбалета, только на 100м часу мне ремесленник принёс. И знаю, что один выпадает с ультра босса, где нужно 45 уникальных мобов убить(т.е. тоже в конце игры).

Длинных луков в игре тоже 3 штуки, как нашел в крепости троллей имба лук, так всё время с ним и пробегал. И только под конец ремесленники и феи дали мне ещё пару пушек, которые все равно были хуже лука от троллей.
Зато одноручек насрали столько, что у всего населения королевства рук не хватит. И это при том, что первые 4-5 глав до Питакса ну тебе ничего не падает толком, хотя карту можно на фул зачистить.
Получение шмота только с помощью ремесленников и ниибет.

Тайм лимит - это помойка. Он относительно адекватный, но нихера не весёлый и не нужен. Только лишний раз напрягает, как и скрытый таймер на квестах. Зафейлить сложно, но зачем его тогда вообще делать?

Сюжет в игре, как и в 90% изометрических рпг - для галочки. Авторы пытаются в твисты и всё такое, но удивлюсь, что кто-то и правда проникся нириссой, или кому-то вообще было не насрать на эту дженерик хероту. Пару раз авторы трогают сложные темы, но в сравнении с пилларсами 1 вообще не вывозят.

Когда-то давно я ещё писал, что эта игра напоминает скучную книгу - так вот текста в игре немного после первых двух глав. А текстовка конечно не уровня дивинити в плане позорности, но весьма слабоватая.

Интерфейс, описания - это и так понятно. Но вот сейчас играя в бг3 - можно сказать, что во многом интерфейс тут удобный. Просто неинформативный.

Если подводить итог, то для меня это mixed, но духота последних двух актов убивает желание хвалить игру, а её есть за что хвалить.
Это плохо, когда нужно 60% механик отрубать, чтоб получать удовольствие при том, что за все эти механики как бы шаришь. ДнД системы не работают в кудахтерных играх.
Ласт главы так вообще душат хуже, чем +35 на улице.

С воодушевлением(уже нет) смотрю на сиквел, к которому до сих пор пилят миллион патчей и длц, но сама игра баллов на 5-6 из 10, и то из-за боевки. Убрать духоту последних актов и тупых механику, сделать игру более text-heavy(хотя в сиквеле с текстом пездец проблемы), чуть фиксануть компаньонов - и было бы тупа топ.

Clocking in at probably 170 hours for a single play-through excluding AFKing, I find it hard to say I didn't enjoy it. However, it’s easy for me to say that I think most wouldn’t enjoy it. This game has some *serious* flaws. I'll summarize them and the strengths below:

WEAKNESSES

- Performance: this game is probably the worst game I've ever played for performance. I have an RTX 4090, a 5800x3d, 36gb of RAM - a top-end PC for 2023. Despite this, in a 2018 game, there are *many* moments where my FPS was single digit to low 20s. I know Unity engine isn't great but this is inexcusable, other Unity games like Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 weren't even mildly close to this. Cyberpunk2077 with ultra ray tracing ran better. Truly makes me wonder what test PC they had when doing QA in development, must've rented from NASA HQ. 

- Length: normally length and abundance of content I'm eager to celebrate, but this game is truly way, way too long, to its detriment. There are dungeons/zones that are just artificially lengthened because large enemy packs are around every corner. The various story acts are all fun and I wouldn't cut any, but they absolutely could've been shortened. The amount of encounters is probably more reasonable with real-time-with-pause, but I like turn-based, the game offers it, and absolutely did not cater to it. Kingdom management wastes a ton of time, more on that below.

- DLC (Varnhold's Lot): this DLC is just bad, honestly. It's supposed to tie-in to one of the Acts of the game, but you could easily cut the entire DLC and replace it with a 2 minute cutscene and the effect on the story is the exact same. The gameplay isn't great either - it's mostly just one giant dungeon that has too many enemies, and whisks away two characters in your party that completely ruins any composition/synergy you were trying to go for. You're made to create 4 new characters just for this <10hour DLC, which felt unnecessary. Also ties into the length I brought up above - this DLC should've been better or outright cut.

- Difficulty: I'm a fan of developers embracing difficulty, and CRPGs have never been a genre to shy from that, but this game does it in the wrong way. Difficulty for some fights is excessive, others that should be harder (ie, big story boss) end up being a joke. The tuning is really bad. Several fights I struggled with, I later checked YT and every video I see are people just cheesing it with strats like stacking a ""wall"" ability multiple times so it 1 shots things passing it. When I think of strategy and adapting to an encounter, I don't have that in mind. Also the strategy and how you approach an encounter hardly ever changes - it's almost always: pre-buff your party to high heaven, stack as much AC as possible on the front most character, and you're good to go. Not unique to this game, pre-buffing and stacking AC is par for the course, but other games like Pillars of Eternity gave me a lot more variety in strategy on an encounter-by-encounter basis. Both main game and DLC add needless difficulty by forcibly removing characters from your party, which you may have built your composition around, making the game harder in an unsatisfying way.

- Kingdom Management: the infamous system every negative review is probably complaining about. They're not wrong, it's bad. I played with a Kingdom Mgmt. mod that made it tolerable. The system is overly RNG, doesn't feel like successes and failures had anything to do with your decisions, rather a dice roll. Many kingdom events repeat, you'll see some 10+ times, which gets stale and again, artificially increases the length/doesn't respect the player's time. It comes off as too much like menu management rather than leading a kingdom's development.

- The final dungeon, ""House.."" - separate bullet point because holy shit is it bad. It leaves such a sour taste in the mouth right towards the end of the game. This dungeon is so long, can easily take 5+ hours, and is a combination of everything bad about the game. Too many enemies, check. Companion forcefully whisked away, check. Single digit FPS, check. Artificial length with a dumb gimmicky mechanic, check. Horribly turned difficulty, with trash packs being magnitudes harder than big story bosses, check. Boring and reused environments, check. It's probably the worst level/zone I've come across in any game. It single handedly made the game feel like a slog that I was just trying to get through out of sunk cost. Enjoyability jumped up instantly the moment I was out, but the damage was done.

STRENGTHS

- Companions: easily the game's strongest feature to me. There's a nice range of companions, 10+, and each of them genuinely feels distinct, from the build they have at the time they join your party, to their personality and companion quest. Speaking of which, almost every companion quest was very fun to do, most are easily among the best quests the game has.

- Story/narrative: Not as good as something like Pillars of Eternity 1 but the overall main story was enjoyable and primarily what kept me hooked in the last leg. The game is split into various acts, with a common threat/plot linking them all together. The role your character has, as a ruler of a kingdom, drives the entire narrative, and it felt fun and unique. 

- Builds: Between the wide number of classes, sub-classes, feats and items with special effects, you can make some pretty interesting builds if you put the time into it. Because of this variety, each character in your party can feel distinct in what they're bringing. Thank god too because as mentioned above, the strategy on an encounter-by-encounter basis doesn’t change a lot, variety in weapons and item effects is one of the few ways it did.  

- Dialog options: the game gives a nice range of dialog options, and I often found myself laughing at how wild some of them can be. For example, a visitor can come to your throne room to give you a warning of an impending threat, out of good faith, and you'll be given the option to have the guards hang them under the pretense of them being a spy. Want to be the embodiment of good or a power-drunk sociopath, the game will let you.

- Choices: closely tied with dialog options above, the game gives a lot of choice to the player. Ranging from advice you give companions in their companion quest, to main story decisions which I believe lead to multiple endings, it doesn't feel too linear, which is a key to CRPGs in my eyes.

All in all - I absolutely would NOT recommend this game to someone who's new to CRPGs or loosely likes them. You're going to have more fun with Divinity 1, 2, Pillars of Eternity 1, 2, Baldur's gate 3, Disco Elysium, probably this game's sequel, etc.

However, if you're a fan of the genre and have already tried those games and are looking for something new, this game has merits you'll enjoy. I don't see myself ever playing the game again, just too many problems with it, but am excited to get around to the sequel, with high expectations that significant improvements are made across the board.

There are a lot of things to love about this game: the variety of races and classes classes, mods that greatly expand both races and classes, the novelty of the kingdom management, and quite a bit of the writing and world building.

I just can't stand the ""reload required"" style of this game. I enjoy spending SO much time building and rebuilding parties. Filling gaps in defense, offense, healing, missing skills, etc. I tend to min max a little but keep in mind a bit of roleplaying. I like building balanced, interesting groups that are capable of meeting all challenges. 

This game doesn't support that. There are so many places where you'll find a group of level 18 monster in a level 5 zone, or you'll have a party wipe because your cleric had X memorized instead of Y, or a group of monsters surprises your party and you can't get your squishies out of danger quick enough.  A simple reload can lead to fixing all of those issues.

It turns out I hate games that force reloads unless you either read ahead or already know what's coming. I am not at all the only person to complain about this issue. Ignore the ""get good"" commentators, I didn't and regret investing  so much time in such a promising game. 

If the whole ""oops gotta reload"" thing breaks immersion and breaks your enjoyment don't buy this game.

To me it's a flaw that ruins all the other good aspects of this game.

While I can agree that there are some fights where the enemies can become...overwhelming, I do think the game is well done and a lot of effort went into its creation.
To me, a game succeeds when it makes you genuinely feel emotions for your companions (which in the case of video games are- in reality- pixels on a screen) but you still feel connected to them. Pathfinder managed to help me achieve that feeling, and as such I rate it 4.5/5 stars.
If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable story, look no further!

*Extra note: If you are worried about getting your money's worth, it is a long game and took me 155 hours to play through the main story line, without really exploring too many extra spots. So yes, well worth it!

Just be warned: the game does not know how to onboard you to the complexity of its combat and build system so if you are here for the story mostly, do not be afraid to manipulate the dificulty into the ground. I play on a slightly harder version of the STORY MODE and recommend the same if you lean more to the story and exploration aspects of rpgs.
MANY OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS COME FROM PEOPLE THAT REFUSE TO JUST NERF THE DIFICULTY AND FEEL LIKE THE GAME IS A NASTY DM.  I get it, you shouldnt have to, but i'm just telling you how you will have a better experience. It's a FLAWED and hard game if you engage with the combat and build systems on its terms. It's a better experience if you are here for the story.
 Anyway.
While not as good as WOTR, it has a worthwhile plot; interesting, well thought-out companions, and if you liked the Throne Room aspect of Dragon Age: Inquisition, you will have something for you here with its central theme.
Way too many locations on the map are pointless battle arenas, and travelling ti feels sluggish. Also something that was improved in the new one.
 I recommend having the Camera Control and Toybox mods to solve some annoyances. Especially with the fixed camera.
 If you can be patient with its more rough edges, it's really worthwhile, but if you are on the fence about the Pathfinder CRPGS, play WOTR first, I guess. 
To reiterate, this one is still good and worth your time even if the sequel is better and more polished.

The story is good, the party members are interesting, and it has an extremely thorough implementation of the pathfinder ruleset.

Here's some things to be aware of:
- the kingdom management is very unforgiving. If you fall behind, you will slip further and further behind. it's very hard to recover.
- the game, especially in the last third, relies very heavily on extremely cheesy enemy abilities and mechanics. every fight becomes a complete slog. 
- the ""true"" ending is incredibly hard to get without a guide, and requires you to make perfectly correct decisions over this hundreds-hours game.
- no, seriously the combat gets ridiculously hard

I highly recommend turning down the difficulty, either from the beginning or as soon as you start to get frustrated at how long it takes to complete. If you are not super confident about build-crafting, build and level guides (like on neoseeker) for both your player character and your party members is a must.

The game is pretty rough to get into because of the underlying systems and requires a lot of effort from the player to start off with the right foot (especcially if you have not played too much pathfinder yet).
After learning the combat basics I set my foot off to explore the world. [b]And then game just f*ck*d me.[/b] [i]With a timed Quest, which I prioritised.[/i] It came to a step in the quest, where I had to ""Wait until the fog clears"" which I wanted to use and explore more. But because I failed to hit some of the many triggers, after the counter went down to Zero, the game failed, which would set me back approx. 10-15 hours of Gameplay. 
I can not do that. That is terrible design.
Maybe i will come back one day and start a new run. The game itself looked promising. 

[b]TL,DR: Timed quests with no clearly communicated triggers made me fail the game, costing me too much time enjoy replaying. [/b]


Update:
I started a new character and run on a business trip and continued to play that character for around 55-60h. At first i found the Kindgom mechanics interesting and engaging. There are certain timed world event that threaten your Barony, which puts a lot of urgency onto the player for the preperations for those events. 
Cool so far. 
But the further i got, the more tedious and annoying the Kingdom became. You cant have fun exploring as much, because you will have to juggle your kindgom at all times for it to be efficient, which you can only do inside of your barony. This caused me to not be able to enjoy exploration, because you have to go back asap anyways.

There are some interesting, well done quest lines you can play through, but the pressure of the world events and the kingdom management just suck the joy and life out of all exploration.

Enemy variety is okay, but the fights in turn based mode often times feel tedious because of the rolls you sometimes get. I can only take so many misses at a 95% hit chance, please.

[b] Overall.... i don't know. It was not bad to play the game. But I still can not recommend it. It's just not rewarding enough to warrant 100h of playtime. [/b]",1668713131,1690706307,False,3,0,0.502562940120697021,0,True,False,False

As an isometric RPG it doesn't break any new ground, or do anything outstandingly well. And I found myself modding it so much to change and improve things, that all that was left intact was the story.

And then there's the dubious RNG. I have no evidence at all of it being fair or stilted, but it felt heavily stilted. A triple roll is so statistically unlikely, that a gamer can easily go their entire gaming career without ever seeing it happen. But during my time playing P:K, I have seen so many triple roles that I just can't believe that RNG isn't broken. And it doesn't help that they're all below a value of 5. Yes, a triple 5 is every bit as unlikely as a triple 20.

So, in the end, I had a solid story that I liked, heavily modded gameplay, and an infuriating RNG. And that's just not enough to keep me around.

I would like to see games like this move away from traditional approaches, and make decisions based on superior function. For example, P:K could have been immensely improved by simply giving me full control over my party members' builds. Curtailing mechanical function with justifications such as character concepts is a dated idea, and just speaks of limited imagination. And I shouldn't have to mod basic concepts like that into a modern era RPG.

I have a lot more thoughts about P:K, but these are the big ones:
-You need more than good story to carry an unmodded RPG
-I shouldn't have to mod an RPG passed the antiquated traditions of Black Isle
-Whatever this RNG is... just don't.

the good:
1. building a party in pathfinder is so fun

the bad:
1. gimmicky area designs.

entire areas will seem super annoying to beat until you find the trick that invalidates all of the enemies and makes the area trivial. this is usually something like a Resist Energy, Communal on the right element, but the grossest example of this is the last 2 chapters of the game. give your entire party the Blind Fight feat. yes, everyone. this is not a suggestion. this is a requirement for the last 2 chapters if you don't want to be miserable.

2. time limits

straight to jail. what a mistake

3. kingdom management

this system sucks bad. why does it force me to stare at my advisor for 14 days to level them up. why is the upgrade that makes levelling up only take 7 days hidden behind requirements the game never tells me. why are all of the Curse researches completely useless unless I know spoilers about the game. the game gives you too many ways to fail and completely ruin your kingdom management because of a bunch of arbitrary design decisions.

4. too much random arbitrary story tension that clashes with gameplay

there are too many scenarios that look like this: ""theres no time! we have to pick [Quest A] or [Quest B], we can't do both!""

but you can still spend weeks or months doing other random shit before deciding. why have this contrived, fake tension in the game? it does nothing for anyone. the tension in so many decisions just ""there's not enough time to do both"" when there clearly is??? let me make a decision that feels like it matters

Example: Good character A, bad character B, they dislike each other, character A keeps telling you what a hero you are. You save some soldiers' lives (you didnt have to and at your own risk). Later you get dialogue about why your task took too long, this live saving is the reason, you are supposed to explain why you did it. The ""evil"" response is dead soldier can't fight.

I don't want to harp on the puzzle elements of the questline, as ridiculous as they are.  The real problem is that this quest will at some point become a mandatory quest or your kingdom will fail.  To even begin the questline, you need to visit a particular location *on a particular day*, which is frustrating in the first place when the game is telling you that you have a 50 day deadline;  You may start off just burning 1-6 days just to get the date lined up.  Then, the game disables your capital and throws high level monster after high level monster at you.  OK, whatever -- I've been hoarding potions so I can just burn through those where I would need to rest but can't.  Got past that?  Your capital is still out of order, but now you have to go to a completely different place filled with spiders that drain your attribute scores, leading you further into an area where the enemies are so high levelled, you would have to try 10-20x and *get lucky* to be able to defeat them.  I'm talking +30 AC, +18 or higher to hit, and they kill any member of your party in three swings, even and especially your AC 31 tank character.  Well let's not let them swing at me, I think, and I try to cast Blind or something to give me the edge, but these assholes have +18 to their Fortitude saves as well.  The culmination of it is that you need to split your party to fight enemies that you can barely defeat with a full party.  It's just a big stupid brick wall.

You can't back out.  If you rest, you'll likely get the kingdom failure screen.  The only options are to reduce the difficulty and or turn on an ""invincible kingdom"" mode to just get through.  For a mandatory main mission quest that PUTS A TIMER ON YOU TO DO IT EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T PREPARED FOR IT.  Owlcat is basically patting us on the head and saying ""aww baby, can't beat a few difficult encounters?  It's okay, we put in a baby mode for you.""

It's one of those games that you promise yourself will be better the next time you play it because you're going to turn down the difficulty, or just fully remove the tedious Kingdom mechanic, or you've read a guide, or whatever. But no. Whatever you do - having fun will simply not be on the menu for you.

Your attacks missing every round? Your healer getting insta-gipped? Invisible enemies spawning on top of you? Your whole party getting instantly paralyzed from a spell you are seeing for the first time? Absurd difficulty spikes? Now if you like any of those you are in for a treat. 

Fighting frustration, finding the patience of a monk within you, questioning yourself if you even like video games anymore, questioning your life choices. Now those things. Those things are on the menu. And luckily for you it's a pretty big menu. This is a game that simply refuses to end. Just like a toxic Ex-Gf the game simply does not respect your time.

Annoying mechanics, hit/miss combat, walls of text for spells/locations/history, mostly bland companions and characters. So is there anything holding the game together? I have no idea. Even if I knew Pathfinder to a tee I just cannot imagine the game flowing smoothly.

This game did not make me feel guilty for playing it. For the most part it felt like I was doing work or something else very different to playing a video game. How is that possible? Was I even having fun? I don't know anymore.

My save is at the last stages of the game - The House at the Edge of Time. And I simply do not wish to continue playing to finish the game. Whatever happens will simply not be worth it for me. I would much rather watch a playthrough of somebody else doing it.

Kingmaker is just like that brunette I knew I shouldn't have messed with, everything ended badly, and yet sometimes I want to check on her. Even after these 100hrs of mostly insipid gaming there is still a part of me that wants to do the whole thing again.

Maybe this time I will roll a ranger, or a paladin, or just something different. I will pay more attention to different companions, maybe even my kingdom, who knows? The possibilities are endless.

Or maybe I will just settle for spending 100hrs + with her hotter younger sister that actually let's me be a Lich and does everything Kingmaker does but better from what everybody is saying about her.

Decided to read up on mechanics and follow a walk through for the first part of the game. Things are starting to make more sense now.

This is a really hard game for me to say if it is worth it or not. I do like this game but there certain aspects of this game that makes it really hard to like. Or to recommend or to even write about. 

That and I have gotten pretty far but certain things happen that makes me restart. The first time it was because if you don't do certain things in the right order at the start. You can overlook kinda important characters you can add to your party which may make certain elements of your game easier then others. But they dont tell you that. And you will never run across them again. My second restart is because of the bs game mechanics. Every main quest is time locked even when it doesn't tell you it is. Which is really annoying. And these are really important. So I had to restart because I missed one and another and another. My third and final is and not the game fault. So the cloud saves is a lie. When they say cloud it is bs. My ssd with it broke and I lost all of the data. And again. Cloud saving in this game is bs. Don't listen to them. Either your saves will be completely missing or I booted it up a second time and it was there but I couldn't access it because certain characters like my main character was gone. Really annoying,. But it is what it is. Save the game in a second hard drive or something or ssd card. None of these were really short as well. This game is at least 30+ hours if not more. So ya. 

As I said, this inst all the bs mechanics in this game. Like spider swarms. If you know, you know. Kingdom management. The fact that kingdom have events that take 14 fucking days just to update your people. Etc... And this isn't dark souls hard. This is bad design in my eyes. At times. Or just flat out cruel at times. Hell fear and hunger is more tolerable then this at times. And that game.... ya. There are a lot more but ya. That is my main issues. 

And I am no stranger to dnd and/or pathfinder. Honestly, my third play through. I put fucking mods in it and I am glad I did that. It made my experience of this game improve a lot. And I recommend you play it one time and then put on fucking mods. Or do it right away. Trust me.

Most of the criticisms people have for this game seem to be true. However, the biggest problem I have is the size of the cloud save file. It's just short of half a gigabyte. Easily the largest of any game I could find in my library. If you are on garbage tier internet like me, and you need the cloud because you have a second system you run the game on, it is almost a deal breaker. Every time I exit the game, it's 20-30 minutes for the upload to finish. During this time my internet is unusable. Downloads from the cloud are fine. I've opted out of sharing data and have the game set to store only 1 quick and auto save file. Anyways, first world problems. I didn't try too hard to fix it. It's just annoying.

I will say I'm not a fan of the time limits put on certain questlines. I'm currently at the end of chapter 3 and have to start the game over because I don't have enough in game time left to finish what I need to. Probably 60-70 hours of playtime.

There are lots of companion  side quests with most being rewarding to the story.  If you like Pathfinder or 3.5 D&D this game is a must play.   I have not enjoyed a CRPG this much since Neverwinter Nights II.   

Things that were OK and I wish were better;

Kingdom management-  I wish there was more to it.  Good concept, minimal impact (except being punitive)and time consuming.  It just seemed to fall short of what it could be and the benefits you receive could have been better.  After a while it was repetitive. 

Rest System-  Very good concept but it did become a little annoying when exploring.   Also, it makes the beginning of the game very hard when you start out.   

Spells/ Buffs-   You MUST Buff your party all the time or you will most likely die all the time.  This gets a little annoying but is manageable.  Spend time customizing your toolbars.  Seriously.... use the difficulty options to make the game easier.  It baffles me how people play this game on max difficulty.   I don't know how they can play it.  

Lastly, I don't want to give away spoilers, but, the game contains certain puzzles that can be infuriatingly difficult.  I had to go to walk-through videos on YouTube to get past some of them.   I thought the game was bugged a couple of times.   If I didn't use the help, I would not have finished the game.   They can be painful........ So much so that if I ever see a blue lantern at a store I may smash it.

Pathfinder isn't a perfect game, but as RPG it's close to perfection
As someone who played in dozens of different RPGs, my favorite genre, this game has easily become one of my favorites.

Let's  start with the negative aspects of the game:
1. BUGS, It seems like the RPG genre is cursed with bugs, and even in the Enhanced Plus Edition, you may encounter some unpleasant bugs.
2. Some of the game's mechanics can really eat up your time. I'm looking at you, shitting equipment weight limit! And don't even get me started on how slow the travel speed is. But there's a handy mod called Bag of Tricks that can save a lot of hours for you.
3. This game has timers in quest and some people complains about it. I don't think it's a big disadvantage it adds to the non-linearity of the story and if you overstay your timer it doesn't mean the consequences will be bad. But I must admit that not all timers are implemented well throughout the game.


Now, let's dive into the great things about Pathfinder:


1. This game has engaging and unique story. Yes, it's not the absolute best story I saw, but Pathfinder still offers an interesting and unconventional narrative that I almost didn't see among video games. The characters have motivation, making it easy to empathize with them. The story itself is good written and can to surprise you on multiple times.
2. Pathfinder has complex and rewarding game mechanics. If you invest the effort to learn and understand them, you'll be rewarded with a deep and satisfying gameplay experience. Alternatively, you can choose the ""story"" difficulty for a more easy playthrough.
3. Your choices are meaningful and has consequences. A lot of your decision has impact on the world and the story. A simple conversation with a merchant in the first chapter can  change your encounter with them three chapters later. Killing a character during the story can lead to their brother seeking revenge 30+ hours into the game. You can play as an evil character or a good character. And the world reacts to you in different ways.

If you love good stories and RPG I'm sure that this game worth your time. The story will keep you hooked, the gameplay will challenge and reward you.

For me, it's one of the best RPGs in history",1689514389,1689514389,True,1,0,0.521199584007263184,0,True,False,False
640820,142175935,76561197988836038,0,5,4985,0,4985,1689478183,"I read the adventure modules and was planning on running the campaign for a group I played with before it disbanded so I had a good idea of what to expect going into the game. I am very familiar with Pathfinder's game mechanics especially the slow start, so the early game wasn't anything too difficult to overcome I never really had any problems with random encounters either, however I will warn any trying the game to avoid doing the fang berry quest until you have gained a few levels. The gameplay is DECENT not great, it isn't really the worst game out there but it just has so many problems little things that could have been better if you want a CRPG I'd check out underrail though it is not fantasy the gameplay is much better. Others have mentioned that the game feels like its stuck in a GM vs Players mentality which I cannot agree with more the review does leave out some of the bad decisions/poor design elements below listed in no particular order:

1. THE SLOW BOOK INTRO, HOLY HELL WHY, WHY IS IT SO SLOW, WHY DOES IT START AT AN ANGLE, EVERY TIME I START UP THE GAME I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SLOW BOOK, WHY ISN'T IT A ONE TIME THING OR HAVE A BOX I CAN CHECK IN THE OPTIONS MENU, WHY DO I HAVE TO INSTALL A MOD TO DEAL WITH IT?
2. The nonadjustable slow movement outside of combat it truly makes the game feel like a slog and hurts the pacing. Clicking something close by will reduce your party's speed to a slow waddle it winds up eating FAR MORE TIME THAN IT SHOULD, if you want to get somewhere with any kind of speed you have to click very far away. Seriously why not have them move a constant speed especially if the game pauses when you see traps?
3. The CONSTANT, CONSTANT, CONSTANT throne room events where craftsmen will come in every week forcing me to sit through their bowing and asking me if I want anything, holy hell you idiots just dump your garbage in the chest one time a month AT THE SAME TIME, I'll seek you out if I want something specific, or hell add somebody to the throne room that lets you make the requests I DONT NEED TO SEE EIGHT MERCHANTS BOW AT ME 400 TIMES A YEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STUFF THEY MAKE IS NO LONGER USEFUL BEYOND SELLING.
4. The lack of EMPHASIS on game ending/critical events, I got to the war of the river kings before rage quitting, I had to look up an outside guide to discover that I was supposed to invade the stupid fairy's dreams in order to progress the story, it is a project that takes 60 days to complete, there was no indication it was CRITICALLY IMPORTANT so I delayed focusing on Pitax's garbage by the time I learned of my mistake I had an event pop up that informed me Pitax was going to wipe out my kingdom... in 59 days, seriously? Why didn't you put that blue ! next to the event like several of the other dangerous events? During this segment of the game it also failed to emphasize the need for exploration to eradicate the river bandits, you might think that is common sense but another part of the quest that requires you to find where the monsters are coming from had you do a kingdom event, so I sat there waiting for an event to tell me where I needed to go but nothing happened.
5. The lack of emphasis on recruiting certain advisors, during the troll saga if you want to recruit a certain economist you need to stop at a river crossing during the saga or he will forever disappear he is not able to be recruited in any other location or at any other time. I explored that location much earlier so never knew he existed until I needed an economist, during the early parts of the game. I was ultimately forced to hire a mercenary to serve as my economic advisor which stops you from getting events on kingdom rank up.
6. Material components - inside of the actual tabletop RPG its pretty easy to deal with you just tell your DM I'd like to buy X diamond dust you mark it on your sheet and subtract the gold, then move on. In this you have to seek out the merchant (see #1 why this is annoying), sit through a loading screen, then you get to sit through a loading screen again as you enter the kingdom screen.
7. Kingdom management - I always felt behind when managing the kingdom as if I always had a 50% or lower chance of success without the stupid tokens, what was truly annoying was discovering that hitting rank 3 in certain areas or owning a DLC unlocked LOTS of utility. IIRC, Divine 3 to unlock Arcane, Arcane 3 to unlock teleportation circles so you can teleport from one village to another saving you WEEKS of travel time. If you own the wildcards DLC you can also unlock a building that lets you manage your kingdom from adjacent non owned regions, I have to question why this was not in the base game. The two week time to rank up is also incredibly annoying, It feels as if the game doesn't want me to explore at all.
8. Several of the followers are annoying bastards, I really don't want to deal with them in the slightest (LOOKING AT YOU NOK-NOK and LINDSEY) yet I am encouraged to keep them around because...
9. Mercenaries have a few issues- they don't start with the same XP as your main character instead starting at 0 xp of your level not the end of the world but they are almost always behind facing delayed level ups, the mercenaries are also very expensive meaning a full party of mercenaries is not something you can do without editing your save game folder, and when using mercenaries as advisors they suffer a -2 to all rolls and may not trigger kingdom flavor events.
10. Speaking of mercenaries, That wizard advisor I mentioned earlier? Yeah I accidentally dismissed him, you see there is a little red X in the top right corner of the character's portrait in the party selection screen and clicking on it basically deletes the party member from where it is located you would think it would just remove them from the party but nope, turns out I accidentally dismissed him (and all his wonderful gear) in order to do Octavia and Regonger's stupid companion quest. Upon discovering my mistake I realized the game doesn't do a lot of auto-saves and the last save I had with him was about two hours back. I dropped the game for years before coming back.
11. Finally there are the loading screens, somewhat fixable with an SSD or other good hardware, even still the load times are noticeable and frequent adding even more wasted time to your very short life.",1689481403,1689481445,False,3,0,0.540000021457672119,0,True,False,False

Lazy writing on the story side, laughably shallow and caricaturistic NPCs, broken probability, restrictive classes that does not ever allow you to play the character you wanted etc. etc.
----
Probably one of the worst game I have ever played. Such a waste of money, more importantly TIME.

%80 of game is nothing but resting, listening shallow stereotypes of characters written without slightest effort. You can find out a characters alignment with every single dialog they have, like the barbarian Amiri or something.

Game is detailed, that suppose to be a good thing but if I have to look up every single detail from its wiki why the hell Im playing the game? Just sit and read the garbage - but no the story is so shallow, lacks of any interesting trope if that was a movie or series it would get a generous TWO out of ten.

Classes and builds are so restrictive, so railroaded if you make any changes on your base build you won't get pass the third or fourth encounter even in the ""Normal"" mode. Do-not confuse it with ""Game is hard"" game is broken, half of classes are garbage, any customisation (which is the backbone of a roleplay game) will lead to catastrophy.

And finally there is the dice system. 1-2-4-1-2-2-2-2-2-2-4-2-5-7!-2-1-2-2 on my side while the enemy is more like 15-17-20-20-8-10-11-16-10-20-17 and list goes on. D20 is a TTRPG setting, where the game is runned by a conscious human being its not fit for a PC game, developers cant see that simple fact? Also I'm a HEMA fighter myself, I sometimes fight with Rapier&Dagger and I assure you my hit rate is far beyond %5, even though I'm not ""proficient"" with rapiers. I've played many turn based RPG's before but that system...seriously a joke, an insult to the player, I'm just sitting and watching 6 character missing every single attack or spell, wasting hours.

stupid complex, but most systems can be ignored, leaves experience feeling kind of hollow with faithful realtime combat, but the source (the pen and paper game) is limited because of its medium, the concept is just not great for a modern audience. 
bought on sale, was super excited to play, not quite what i was looking for
even with decent 5e knowledge, after the first 5 minutes i had no idea what was going on
i did like the story though, but the combat felt like a chore, especially as it felt like the game is intended to be played in a veryyyy specific and rigid framework of; sneak, scout, back, tank in, line up spells, unpause, etc...
the whole combat being realtime was painful? i wasnt sure what was queued and who was doing what, like a combination of the worst parts of RTS micro, spam pause-playing, and crazy deep pathfinder rules
after the first hour i turned combat to easy story mode, and then the whole game felt hollow 
the three pillars of play: exploration, combat, and roleplaying, and the exploration was alright but constrained by the combat focused majority of movement and interaction mechanics, and the combat sucked? it wasnt fun, and i dont want to bother grinding through more of it?

Not for everybody but if crunchy detailed simulation of tabletop RPG is your thing, this game is something special. The character generator is truly bonkers in the amount of flexibility it allows. There's about 20 different Classes, most with 3-4 sub-archetypes. Want to give a Barbarian some cleric spells and a pet smilodon? Done. Maybe a Monk / Alchemist who doses themselves with performance enhancing mutagens before combat? This is not every Class in all of Pathfinder but it's about twice as much as what's in the 1E Core Rulebook. 

Of course with great power comes... a learning curve. Kingmaker has beautiful presentation and a tutorial prologue that is both entertaining and informative, but once the training wheels come off there is no denying this is a game with a lot of numbers and details to keep track of. Combat defaults to realtime-with-pause, but there's a button to turn on true turn based combat a la tabletop Pathfinder, which is the place to be. Combat feels more tactical and a little bigger in scope than other isometric RPGs — party formation, weapon/spell ranges, it just feels a lot like good tabletop combat. Pathfinder is based on DnD (3.5E SRD) and everything works similarly in terms of combat, spellcasting, character progression, etc..

It's isometric perspective with a fixed camera. This isn't my favorite thing but I can respect it as a design decision since the maps are so beautifully detailed and lit. There's enough hinting/feedback in the UI that it's usually pretty easy to keep track of the action even when characters are visually obscured. Mostly it's fine. 

Story is extremely tropey yet charming and well-written. Voice acting is mostly pretty good, writing has some clever / funny moments, it's apparent there is a rich library of lore the game can draw upon. 

It's a little glitchy which isn't surprising with a game of this size. Nothing too serious, one time an event triggered at the wrong time and I had to restore from a quicksave. SAVE OFTEN though because this game is pretty tough. If you are looking for a casual story-driven RPG this might feel like Too Much Game, but if you are prepared to spend some time thinking about character builds and like a challenge, this is great.",1689172580,1689172580,True,9,0,0.639301300048828125,0,True,False,False

Patience is the keyword in this massive game, which in many ways, once you reach the end, is like a movie or a book with many layers of content you maybe didn't quit get the first time. So like a movie or a book this game can make you start all over again, because now you are aware of where to be patient with the stuff that maybe seemed unimportent the first time around, but which you now know, holds a payoff in the end.

A lot of time is also a keyword with this game, since it really is massive and conected through a web of decisions you make, but the value of which, sometimes isn't always obviously and therefore requires - patient in the terms of thinking through what you wanna do or say and the other way around.

Is the game for everyones taste?
After having played it twice, my personel verdict is that it brings back memories to me of having finished a series of games like: Baldurs gate I & II or Mass effect I, II & III, but here - all put together in one massive game.

- Your companion characters are brilliant and diversiv, each with their own story and way of doing things.
- You get make a lot of choices, which all has a massive impact on the end of the game.
- Combat is what you make it to be, depending on your tactices and how you develop your own character and your companions.
- Freedom of choices on how to play the game is super. As an example you don't have to follow the games suggestion for your companion characters classes. I, suprisingly enough to myself, ended up with a rough-beastmaster, dual-class character, who stormed into battle with his fatihful mastrodont and it somehow seemed to fit with the characters origin story.

So it the game for everyone?
The downside of having a game this massive is that, like with a movie or a book, towards the end it losses momentum. The story is still great, you have made your choices and the payoff seems right around the corner and then somewhere in the endgame - it's like one of your companions says: ""We already prepared for final battle and now we're doing it again"".
It's like a section of the endgame should maybe have been cut or tightened, cause it plays like we're ready to rock, but unfortunatly we don't know where to rock and right now - the last thing we wanna do is having to find that out!

Luckly the small setback is mended once the game is done and you put down the quill for the last time.

There are some dumb decisions by devs though, you explore wrong thing at wrong time you can miss out on a companion (jubilost) other weird decisions as well that should have been patched out or removed (if you have the wrong alignment a character will die), its ridiculous. Not to mention no console which means fixing shit like that is impossible. Explains why the overall rating is at 80ish percent positive and not 90 something because its otherwise good

Also i recommend playing on easy because the combat is just tedious as it always is in isometric rpgs why bother torturing yourself, just chill with good story and characters. It doesnt take skill to be ""good"" at turn based strategy games, it takes patience yes and time looking into good builds but thats just boring crap like why bother who cares. I get 0 enjoyment out of minmaxing a build thats some gay ass shiit. roleplaying is where its at and thats where this game is good. 

I would rather be weirdo vivisectionist creep thats useless in combat just so i can roleplay than do some OP slayer build like why would you ruin the roleplaying with that crap so stupid.

For combat i recommend divinity original sin 1 and 2, but the story and rpg elements here are much better honestly. Those 2 are very overrated in terms of roleplaying. good combat but i dont care about combat so no thanks

The writing, characters, story, setting, and narrative choices/influence are very good overall but the fun is somewhat brought down by game design choices.

Be aware that this game constantly has a timer. After the beginning portions of the game, you have a consistent countdown of days to the end. You have to manage your time spent travelling, resting, and managing your kingdom. Although I didn't have trouble managing this system, I could definitely see others struggling with this. There is an option to turn the kingdom management off, but this locks you out of unique quests and gear relating to artisans of your kingdom, as well as opportunities for you to RP and make choices as ruler. To get the full experience you have to endure the kingdom management, which I did not enjoy. The management boiled down to Problems>Claim Territory>Rank Up>Misc... if you follow that project priority you will have more than enough time every chapter to get ahead of the curb and keep the system at bay. Once you know that the system becomes an annoyance more than anything.

Another complaint is polish. Multiple instances of T-posing models, glitched dialogue boxes that would logic loop, pathing not working properly at times, items that say they have an effect but do not have it in-game, an item that would cause my game to run at 15 FPS when I equipped it, number of saves effecting performance... and on and on. None of these on their own make the game unplayable or ruin the experience completely, but it happened at such a consistent rate that it definitely brought down the experience a bit for me.

Length of the game is another issue, for me at least. Keep in mind that Steam exaggerates my playtime (in-game save finished at around 150 hours), but regardless the game felt like it dragged on too long. Without spoiling anything, there are a couple chapters in the game that genuinely felt like filler to the overall plot of the game. By the end of the game I was feeling quite a bit burned out and was honestly looking forward to the game ending. This was not helped by the fact that the last dungeon of the game is one of the most sadistic, annoying final levels I might have ever played. Up until that point I had played on Challenging Mode, and the game's combat up to that point had been borderline trivial. All of a sudden, I had to drop back to normal to feel like I even had a fighting chance.

Narrative, however, is where this game shines and truly redeems itself. You are constantly making choices and seeing those consequences in-game. My kingdom and yours can feel VASTLY different by the end of the game, as well as each individual companion's fate. Owlcat provides so many opportunities for roleplay, which at the end of the day is what we are all here for. Even choices aside, simply the writing on its own drew me in quite a bit, especially the first chapter and the last two chapters.

Overall still a fantastic game, but you can definitely tell this was Owlcat's first project.",1689007475,1689007788,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It's story is well told, with likable companions, player choices matter and surprisingly good music.
Unfortunately, Dev choices made in some places make the game difficult to enjoy.
My time of 116 hours was one playthrough, where I beat the game. I did not 100%, because miss-able quests, companions, and effects of choices I made early on made me unable to select necesssary options 50+ hours later. Even with a walkthrough, I believe it is impossible to 100% on a single playthrough.

The RPG part of the game works as expected, Pathfinder's system uses large bonuses, forcing you to meta-build your characters and focus on pre-buffing the party with spells or potions/scrolls before entering the fight... Relying on dice rolls alone will often cause outright failure. For example, enemies armor classes in mid to late game are regularly 35+. Meaning a D20 roll with a plus 5 has no chance of succeeding. Even rolling a natural 20 can still fail to crit. Some points are overtuned, where if you do not pre-buff and have well-built characters, you will die. There is no fleeing battles either, so hope you have a save ready!
Gearing works as RPG's do. pick the best weapon and use it forever, only swapping to one that is slightly better multiple times over. Same with armor and other equipment. Can be found by killing enemies, buying it or finding it. The game will throw multiple redundant equips at you, but they may not stack!
Cant have the hat of +1 strength and also a belt of strength +2, only the highest buff is taken. But good luck finding another hat that does anything else.

The Kingdom management is in my opinion, a failed gameplay experiment. There is no reason to increase the difficulty of it, because all that does is increase the DC of all check. Playing on the easiest difficulty, besides ""Do it for me,"" still had DC of 40 on occasions. Your advisors, who can either be your playable companions or NPCS, have to have their primary skill related to the job they do raised as high as possible. Plus, raising the kingdom stat by spending time increasing it through an event. If they are not high enough, and you don't have stockpiled currency that increases your dice roll, you will fail. Period.
The game is determined to throw not only events that require high scores, but straight take away points because you didn't do it fast enough. For me, it was tedium and un-fun with no way to actually skip.

In Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity games. And seemly out of left field from a non-U.S. based studio Owlcat Games: Pathfinder: Kingmaker.

In a weird way, this hits the closest to the old Infinity Engine games because it uses the Pathfinder rules, which don't be fooled is just re-branded D&D 3.5+. Icewind Dale II, the last Infinity Engine game, used D&D 3.0. Troika's 2003 The Temple of Elemental Evil actually used 3.5. 

Where am I going with this? No where in particular. Only to say we Pathfinder now B!tches! And Pathfinder: Kingmaker delivers. A natural progression. A full modern update. 

I have caveats though. (of course!)

Much of the encounter design can feel overly harsh, but can easily be solved completely with ""silver bullets"". In these cases it quickly becomes a one trick pony e.g. all enemies deal huge amounts of electric AOE damage. So cast protection from electricity, communal. Now sleep walk through the entire map while laughing at their foolish attempts at dealing even a single point of damage. This would easily be solved with a more mixed encounter approach. It isn't a huge deal most of the time, but it IS a thing.

The Kingdom management meta-game is also rightly criticized. It is a sizable portion of the game where you will spend many months over the course of the game carrying out edicts, building settlements, etc. While it didn't bother me that much, if I ever decided to replay the game, I would definitely lower the difficulty of it so I could instead brain fart though it and focus on the party-based gameplay. 

I would be remissed if I didn't mention time limits. This game has them. It has them in spades. Every chapter has a time limit. It's very generous and you have plenty of time, but it also allows time for Kingdom management, and a lot of it, but even so in some cases, certain quests within a chapter itself also has its own separate time limit. These are less forgiving and must be acted upon immediately. You may fail some quests if you don't act fast! Also the game has a hard time limit that will force you into the end-game. 

Speaking of the end-game. The final dungeon is so poorly designed to the point of madness. Room to room trash fights against punitive gaze attack enemies as you are lost in a dungeon that easily takes many hours to complete unless you use a guide. In short, it sucks and has soured me on the end-game completely. 

Did I mention this game is long? Sort of like how this review is starting to be? I would say everything up to the penultimate chapter / final dungeon is well done. Although each chapter does feel like it's own separate module / story. I also think the game might be a couple chapters too long. Your mileage may vary.

Still very recommended. Double if you enjoy Baldur's Gate/D&D rulesets. 

P.S. Regarding the DLC the only one that ties into the main campaign story wise is Varnhold's Lot, and I can recommend that. The rest are kinda meh.

I can see why Pathfinder: Kingmaker is popular enough amongst others that it's sold so well, but I feel like it's appeal is to people who basically want the pencil-and-paper experience completely copied onto video game form. There's a lot of grinding, an overly-complex skill and combat system (both in real-time with pause and the turn-based modes), and all of the snail-pace of tabletop rpgs with none of the fun playing with real people brings.

The result is that the first 8 hours I've managed to play, I can't think of a minute of it that was actually fun. The game's obsession with complexity and sticking to TTRPGs rules I think misses the reason we play TTRPGs; they're fun and creative to play with other human beings. Any video game that remains boring after eight hours isn't one for me.

Someone who thinks harder *always* means better, no matter how tedious, and being strict as hell is more important than letting people explore different options.

This game wants you to micromanage all 6 members of your party. You have to pick every skill, every equipment, every ability and spell, very carefully, or you'll risk ruining that companion. You don't want to do it? You have to follow a step by step guide on the internet. How is that fun? Now, some people will be able to craft builds themselves. Not most people though.

The micromanagement is the worst in combat. For some reason, they didn't include AI commands, even though a game that came out 14 years ago, DA:O, had this option. So, you're not really playing a party RPG but managing every single move of a 6 person strategy game. You have to do this, because often a minor mistake will result in total party kill.

Why is it this hard? I have no idea. One moment you're doing fine in an area, another moment you're being overwhelmed by monsters above your level or ones that have overpowered abilities. Don't even get me started on swarm enemies. Yes, you can beat them, but it's not fun at all.

This game is hostile to its players, and I imagine it must be even more hostile to people less used to Pathfinder or DnD rules. Do not, under any circumstances, let this be your first CRPG experience. It will almost certainly turn you off from the genre altogether. In my opinion, if they were going to make it this micromanagement heavy and ""hard ruled"", they at least should've reduced the party size. Even if you can stomach the DM being hostile, you control only a single character in pen and paper, not six. It's as if they tried to compensate for reloading by making the encounters unnecessarily hard.

Last but not the least, there's a very tedious kingdom management mini-game built into the game. It's very vital. You can automatize it, but afaik it prevents you from seeing the secret ending, as well as resulting in you missing out on other content. It's probably the worst part of the game.

In the end, as much as I like the certain freedoms provided by the game, I can't recommend it to most people.

In no particular order.    

Missing tool tips: Missing tool tips everywhere. So that debuff you got? Go look for a guide to why your character is behaving the way they are. Get use to ""other"" because you going to see so many listings of that to your many floating modifiers. You failed a save, you don't know what condition is what. You'll waste time, resources, and F5/F8s (quick save/load) because either it will screw you in a fight, or post fight you'll need to figure out why X or Y doesn't remove it. You'll even find a few tool tips that will just reference an ability or spell, but not explain the ability or spell itself.    

Bugs: There's not a class that doesn't have a bug somewhere in their design. You picked up a ability to ignore damage reduction as a monk fighting style? Too bad it doesn't apply. Rethink your entire build because it doesn't work. Hope you were monitoring the combat log so you could tell you your build wasn't doing what it was suppose to do. At least you can respec a character for free. Only up to three times though, then they charge you gold.   

Hey you invested in meta magic feats. You spent some gauging the added strength to your upcasted spells, then find out they don't apply properly. Did you just realize that? Good that you can load back one of your many constant saves to redo your level up. Wait you don't save before you level up each character, prepare their modified spells, field test them, then compare the values rolled? Well you're shit out of luck then.  Go respec again. 

Ok just go for simple martial build and...  wait armor types and materials aren't apply correctly. That means you get the movement penalties for using medium or heavy armor but half or even none of the extra benefits. Guess that is your fault for engaging in builds that aren't top tier meta and you should have known better that heavy/medium armor is garbage anyway. Don't you know you should be looking up how to build every character before you play the game? Respec number three. Or you seven or nine, depends on how much you screwed up your companion builds. 

You'll look up a lot of these bugs and find that not only did many of these things never work properly, but people discovered them and have complained about it as early as 2018. You'll also notice most bug threads from then stop abruptly, not because they were fixed but because they just accepted that's how it is.


Memory leaks: I think the game ran smoother for me the first round I played it. I'm not running minimum specs and I've since built a whole new computer. After about an hour of time, like clockwork I'd get massive drops in FPS. I'd tweak settings, updates drivers, gauge resource usage with no change. I'd restart the game and it smooth back out. The only thing I've found that would change performance was buffing. I could accelerate how quickly I could tank my FPS if I applied more buffs. Size changing and spells with visual effects really seem to be the worst offenders.  


I could go on about the less technical aspects that I didn't like about the game.  

Poorly told side, main, and companion stories. 
Lack of RP in the game. 
Garbage kingdom management system. 
Lack of tutorials. 
Incomplete reference material for in-game mechanics. 
Companions character builds are either overpowered with stats they can't normally get, or they're hot garbage where their default build, aesthetics, and even background and personalities were designed to actively trick you into making a bad build. 
Fights that are very grindy. 
Fights that crush you early on.
Very easy to miss story flags that have far reaching impacts on the future plot. 
And many, many, many other complaints I could make.  

But the technical issues are grievous enough that I'm willing to forego writing about that and hope my earlier complaints convinces someone not to play this game. It's going to waste your time and frustrate you.",1685871719,1687817221,False,183,2,0.843854010105133057,0,True,False,False

I've played the classics like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate and couldn't stand them. The gameplay was atrocious and the story and characters were middling at best. I've played more recent versions, like Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and couldn't stand those either. The gameplay of 2 at least had a turnbased mode, but it didn't stop the story from being dreary and annoying and the powers confusing and me feeling like an idiot from feeling like I was making poor choices because of how little I was doing any given turn.

I fucking adore this game.

I love the characters, the setting, the plots cool, the (turn based) gameplay is great, literally only two sections actively pissed me off, and that was because of the presence of either lots of will o wisps or lots and lots of fae in combination with a heinously confusing traversal mechanic. But even with me lacking familiarity with Pathfinder 1E as a system, I found the choices I was making for spells and feats easy to parse and never felt like I was doing something wrong. And for the most part it just kept getting better, from starting out clearing out bandit encampments to discovering the cause of a plague to getting into a war with one of your neighbors, the game and story naturally escalate until the only logical conclusion of getting into a war with the first world itself comes up.

To be honest my only complaints are that the final dungeon is BULLCRAP, with so many enemies with some of the most obnoxious abilities and frankly way too much health, and the actual kingdom management aspects being rather vestigial and impossible to feel the effects of until and unless you know how to reap their final rewards. And I'll still take both of those two for the sake of going through a long, complex, interesting story with lots to do and see and a really well done translation of pen and paper to mouse and keyboard. 

Three recommendations if you read this review:
1. Look up guides. Character builds, companion quests, romance guides, all of them. You're not gonna get everything right on the first run through otherwise, and the last area or two become impossible (or nearly so) if you mess to many things up.
2. Explore everything and everywhere. So many of the best items of the game are hidden in kind of out of the way places, so take some time to explore even if you could be improving your kingdom. You'll have time for that later.
3. Don't be afraid to mod. Call of the Wild and Bag of Tricks are my recommendations. If nothing else Bag of Tricks makes it so you don't have to worry about the kingdom stuff while still reaping its benefits.

To start with the good, the game looks great. The models, the textures, the effects it all looks good. While not an actual problem you cannot rotate the camera even thou everything is 3D. So you will be gazing at all the pretty things only from one angle.

The sound, music and voice acting when present are great. There is still a lot of reading to do as some important parts of the game are voiced but the performances are great.

And now I am running out of thinks that I do not have a problem with.

Let's start with the story. Both the main story and the companion quest lines contain same good writing. But then there is some terrible writing like lawful character not wiling to listen to your orders even thou you are the baron and he swore to serve you, if you character isn't lawful then you can go pound sand. And worse of all forgettable writing. The part that saddens me most are the companion quest lines as the companions are actually interesting but their quests are relativity short and completely spread out. This might not be a problem but except for two lines of dialogue while camping there is nothing. You cant talk to them about your progress the don't comment on things just nothing. By the ned I wanted to care about them but just couldn't.

The gameplay is another thing with a lot of potential. In the beginning the fights are fun and challenging but in the right way were you feel good after wining. And then you will have a random encounter with a group of giant elements that are all several levels above you characters and if you by some miracle win you will be greatly rewarded with so much XP you probably wont notice the bar move. The random massive difficulty spikes with no rewards are the worst I have ever seen. Especial the second part of the game feels like an angry DM trying to kill the players for their own sadistic pleasures. Not the mention the penultimate dungeon. I sure hope you party will have specific set of skills otherwise you will be staring at your parallelized characters dying over and over again. The normal game difficulty adjusts enemy damage to 0.8 and turns of criticals against you party in other words this games balance is pile of owlbear shit.

Then there is the kingdom management. Once again pretty interesting in the beginning. Making important decisions, upgrading your capital and surrounding villages. Making your companions your advisors and making them deal with problems. But hold on a minute, why can I send my companion to deal with some plage while they are still in my party on the other side of the country? You see the kingdom management is a ruse. It means nothing. It has no real effects on anything important. That is why you can disable it in the difficulty settings. Number go down game over, but that is it. Its there to waste your time and prolong the suffering. I am certain that was not the intention of the developers, but that is what it ended up being. It feels like they wanted to do much more with it bud didn't likely for time or budgetary reasons.

Lots of this game feels like it needed another pass through QA and the cutting room. The game is bloated. There are interesting things here, but all of them are between enormous layers of fat that should have been trimmed.

This game makes me sad. I really like tabletop Pathfinder, but since I am mostly the DM I don't get to play much. I hoped this game would give me a little bit of that experience. I knew it would be really limited compare to the real thing that is just the nature of not having actual DM.

I thing that I can recommend the first five chapters of this game, but definitely not the second five chapters. I would not buy this game again.",1687128290,1687128290,False,6,0,0.561381816864013672,0,True,False,False

- Soundtrack
- Voice acting (for the most part, except for Linzi)
- Companions (except for Linzi)
- Writing & story (great main plot, good/okayish side quests... except for anything that relates to Linzi in any way)
- Character customization (diversity of race, class & skill combos are almost endless!)
- Complex rules (Pathfinder/DnD 3.5 ruleset; at first it all seemed terribly overwhelming, but I managed to get the hang of things soon enough)
- Loads of content (one single play-through can easily take up +300 hours)
- Replayability (the wide array of classes & skills alone ensure that each play-through is different + plus there are lots of various story-based choices to make)

Things I didn't like:
- Unbalanced difficulty/unfair fights (mind you, I DO enjoy challenges, but I didn't really like what Pathfinder: Kingmaker had to offer in terms of challenges... Being pitted against enemies with insane stats time after time quickly turns into a chore, and it made me continuously feel powerless and exhausted... As a side note, I played on Normal difficulty)
- The game is unforgiving towards new players (I don't like it when I'm forced to read up guides online in advance, I like figuring things out myself; unfortunately, this may result in the player unintentionally messing up some important stuff, which later on can cripple you)
- Inconsistent writing quality (numerous grammatical errors and occasional non sequitur)
- Some minor bugs (like the mouse acting funnily in the Settings menu)
- Occasional FPS drops/overall lagginess (the tooltips especially slow down the game; this is most prominent in the inventory screen, making it clumsy and frustrating to manage)
- LINZI (overly annoying, obnoxious, poorly-versed bard-wannabe whose nasal high-pitched voice is pure torture to anyone's eardrums; the instant she crept up to me and started squeaking, I wanted to squash her to a bloody pulp)

TL;DR: So all in all this game is as good as it is as bad; 50 percent of the time I was having a blast, 50 percent of the time I just wanted to punch through my monitor (100 % of the time I wanted to punch Linzi). Yes, this game is wrath-inducing, it has its own stinking pile of issues, but would I still play it again? Absolutely. And I would probably rage no less than the first time.

The game is lovingly crafted, and I very much want to enjoy it. It has a brilliant creative foundation, and the adventure feels like one long, heroic journey, following multiple, engaging character arcs in a detailed world. However, in reaching the final act I've had to finally accept that I'm not enjoying myself, and would not recommend it to others.

There are many comments I could make on the game, both good and bad, but my difficulty in enjoying it boils down to two aspects that I've struggled to come to terms with.

[Potential Spoilers]

Firstly, this is a difficult game, and the developers are clear that that was their intention. Difficulty itself is not a problem, and I certainly believe games should offer challenge, but failure to apply difficulty in an interesting way can have a terrible effect on how enjoyable it is to face that challenge. In that regard I would say the developers have indeed failed, because the difficulty curve leans far too heavily on that most fundamental demand made by dice systems - to [i]roll big numbers[/i]. The result is an excessive need to optimise your party to overcome specific numerical challenges, while swathes of interesting content that comes with the ruleset becomes unviable. With no desire to min-max my party, nor hand over control of their development to a build guide, and in combination with the innate swingyness of dice systems, it soon felt like I was spending more time watching loading screens after a sequence of mediocre rolls than actually enjoying the game or thinking about creative ways to overcome particular challenges, even after begrudgingly following the advice of the developers and lowering the difficulty from hard to [i]normal[/i].

Secondly, there are narrative outcomes in the game that become unavoidable long before they come to light, with little warning to the player. There are a number of examples of this, but two that stand out to me are the partial outcome of an NPC arc that becomes locked in many real hours prior, if you fail to enter a specific but unremarkable room in a particular dungeon, and of course the infamous kingdom death spiral, an unavoidable game over if you fail to keep your advisors' ranks in fine balance with the difficulty of kingdom events. I appreciate the idea that player choices should not always have a visible outcome - as players, we choose what our characters say and do knowing how we [i]want[/i] events to play out, but part of the fun is uncertainty in what will actually occur as a result. But Pathfinder: Kingmaker takes this to the extreme, giving far too little warning to the effect of seemingly benign choices, and without a GM who can adapt to the actions of the players in order to ensure the game remains rewarding, this simply left me feeling powerless and frustrated.

Overall the game had moments of brilliance, but too often felt tedious or frustrating as a direct result of poor design.

Functionally almost identical to DnD 3.5, and therefore the many games of the Baldur's Gate series, this one has the added wrinkle of exploring and managing your own kingdom, which adds it's own fun and faults to the game. 

If I had any gripes with it, it would probably be that many of the combat encounters are overtuned, which is made even more frustrating when one considers the open-world nature of the map you explore.  It's very easy to waste a lot of time exploring and encountering monsters which far outstrip the abilities of your party.  This matter is made even worse when you find a party member or a piece of loot which would have aided you, had you found them several weeks or months earlier in your travels.  

This design choice wouldn't be inherently bad in and of itself, were it not for the fact that you are TIMED in  your endeavors for most of the game, having only a limited number of days before the next threat has to be addressed.  In an open-world game which encourages exploration, nothing could make me more frustrated than a timer which limits my ability to fully explore said world.  Imagine a timer limiting you in a game such as Skyrim, or any other RPG for that matter. (Persona gets a pass, it works for that game.)

All that being said, if you can handle the harsh difficulty, (which can be adjusted and customized very well) and you enjoy the added difficulty the timer gives, (or you're okay with save scumming or using a walkthrough)  the game offers a fine RPG with plenty of memorable characters to meet, monsters to fight, and quests to complete.   

I give this one a solid 8/10.

(As a side note, if you enjoy this game, and the other game in this series Wrath of the Righteous, consider supporting the makers, Paizo, by trying out the tabletop game as well.  It's very fun, very inclusive, and I've enjoyed playing it as both a player and a Dungeon Master for many years.)",1686558177,1686558264,True,2,3,0.546983063220977783,0,True,False,False

99% of things wrong with this game are related to the kingdom management system:
- everything is on a timer which becomes really annoying if you want to focus on kingdom related activities -> really bad decision
- advisors rely on dice rolls and ability scores to succeed in events / tasks which really sucks because it devolves in endless save scumming to get anything done
- at some point the DC requirements are so ludicrous that most of your advisors will have 0% chance of solving literally anything so kiss your 60+ hours of gameplay goodbye ( this does not make the game replayable, it's just bad game design )
- kingdom artisan item quality is related to how well your kingdom is doing and most of the time you will fail at doing good ( even if you let the AI handle this aspect of the game ) ... so good job devs for managing to hide items behind a broken system
- some events take away advisors, making sure that you will fail in managing a broken system

Other things that while true to the original game experience, do not translate well to a PC game:
- each character can only attempt to lockpick a lock ONCE -> save scum until you succeed
- traps are detected according to dice rolls -> save scum until you succeed
- skill checks in dialogue determined according to dice rolls  -> save scum until you succeed
- kingdom events results determined by dice rolls  -> save scum until you succeed

As you can see, the above could probably make use of some design choices to provide alternative approaches to the classic game especially when the game performance seems to drop after too many save / load cycles.

All in all the game does not respect your time and is full of cheap skill checks and dice rolls to pad game time and seems to have been thought by a GM that never had a good D&D session because he made everyone fight a dragon at level 1 and now everyone hates him and he has no friends. Also lives in a cave under a sewer with his pet rat.

Get this on a substantial discount, turn on invincible kingdom mode / let AI manage it ( AI will still fail though ... says a lot about how well they designed this system ) and only enjoy the CRPG aspect of the game.

UPDATE
A new bit of info i found is that if you make your artisans make something specific for you, they never craft their masterpiece even if you completed all their quests. This is not mentioned anywhere in the game, nor do you have and option to force them to switch from random items to masterpiece. Great design decision, what can i say ...

Reached the last act and i will put this game down. The game designer(s) made sure to make the final stretch of the game a black hole which sucks every last drop of fun this game has to offer and at this point i don't care if i can beat some chick made out of lettuce or not.

It's so bad that when thinking of continuing my game, I start thinking that uninstalling it is a better idea.

Personal note: 

Back in the day i managed to finish Baldur's Gate 2 and the Icewind Dale series without knowing literally anything about D&D and the systems associated with it ( thanks to these games i found out D&D existed ) and still didn't have issues whatsoever. 

This, in my point of view, is a true example of proper game design.

However with the Pathfinder series, it seems that even if you go out of your way to read about the systems being used, you're still having a hard time. My only conclusion is that the game designers simply have no idea how to create an enjoyable experience nor the ability to translate the pnp systems in something fit for a video game ( absolute win / lose dice roll results, weird difficulty curves / spikes, lack of QoL additions and the list goes on ).

Judging by both Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous ( although this is more tame than Kingmaker ), i believe Owlcat should really think whether they want to make games that can reach a wider audience or cater to a much smaller hardcore true to the pnp experience one.

Also fire whoever insists of adding half baked ""management"" systems into their games ( these are only good when fully fleshed out, they're only an embarrassment / annoyance otherwise ) and the dude that designs their difficulty curve ( surprisingly good in Kingmaker UNTIL the last act, all over the place in Wrath ).",1685315017,1685883058,False,3,0,0.475386500358581543,0,True,False,False

Overall (6/10): Fun game with a great story and interesting characters. The plot is unique and our actions do influence the story and the fate of other characters. There is also a neat kingdom management system that gives a sense of developing a tiny chaotic region to a mighty empire while dealing with a bunch of adversities (though this system can be turned off if not for you). However, the gameplay is very complicated (I do not mean difficult), and you will need A LOT of time to try to understand how the mechanics work... you will need to use online guides for most of your time playing this (which gets a bit tiring/boring after a while)

Story (8/10): Best thing about this game. I found the story to be immersive and enjoyed learning about the world and its key players. The game also uses a good-evil/lawful-chaotic decision system, which allows you some control and variety on how you wish to present your character to others. However, I felt that the game pushes you to be good and lawful, to obtain the best endings and easier kingdom management. 

Characters (6/10): All characters are unique and have their own motivations. They also range from good-evil/lawful-chaotic, so you may end up choosing your companions to match your own chosen personality. They are also key in kingdom management and it's interesting to see their own perspectives in making key decisions. Their fate also relies heavily on your behaviour throughout the game... so keep this in mind!

Gameplay (2/10): gameplay is VERY complicated (a lot of mechanics involved with no real explanation on how they work), so the constant use of guides is necessary... this also uses a dice-based combat system which I find irritating...  There's plenty of classes and subclasses to choose and mix from, but impossible to make a decent build without doing your research (I ended up just copying everything from google after getting tired of having to study for every single level). Honestly, half of my gameplay is just reading about the game, instead of playing it... some might find this enjoyable, but I would much rather learn by myself (and not be constantly punished by it). From what I read, there are also major differences in the quality of each class, so there are serious issues with balancing. Also, I found the game towards the end is almost unplayable, as enemies have access to dozens of debuffs that mess up your characters throughout a fight and you need to have the right buff to counter it or you just die... Many times i had to keep reloading, just so the right character woudn't get the debuff, so it could help the others... very messy. Also, bugs... especially in the end which can prevent you from finishing the game. I did not finish my second run because of this.

Graphics (5/10): not too bad considering when it was released. However, the view is always from above and I think we miss out on a lot of details because of it. A few cinematics would also be a good addition when presenting key moments.

If you like story-driven games then this game will be good for you. However, pick the easiest difficulty (even normal difficult will seem impossible if you aren't very familiar with this game).",1685801507,1685803038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting with the bugs, of which there are many. Quests that won't resolve properly, areas where characters get stuck in the midst of combat, animations that aren't accurate to what's happening, invisible events failing... There's a plethora of broken things in this game. But that isn't enough to really make it unenjoyable. If the combat was fun and the kingdom management was relaxing, it would be enough to carry the game.

Neither of these things are true, though.

Starting with kingdom management: there are some major problems with it, the worst of which is that time management is necessary to this game. You will outright lose the game if you don't address quests in a timely manner. This is true for every major quest in the game, including most of the companion quests. Yet what does the kingdom management require? That's right, time! Not an insignificant amount, mind you. Enough that if you level up a few advisors, you immediately face serious consequences to your playthrough.

And if you don't level up those advisors, the mid- and endgame are pretty much unplayable, because your advisors will not be strong enough to complete events. And this is on normal difficulty. My first playthrough I had to quit outright, because the game doesn't make it very clear how important leveling up is, instead making it seem like you're wasting time doing so. Second playthrough I managed to eke out some levels on my advisors, but even then I had to save-scum through at least half of the events or I would've had yet another game over.

And the combat... I really enjoy isometric combat games like Baldur's Gate, but Kingmaker takes the best parts of those and just makes them tedious and completely un-fun. Controls don't respond properly half the time, directing individual characters in combat is a pain, and as you progress the game doesn't really treat you fairly: instead of seeing reasonable combats against foes of approximately equal level, like in an actual tabletop game, it's as if the GM is constantly flinging the most broken, overpowered groups at you over and over and over, spamming powers that you have no real means to contend with. Icy Pillar, anyone? Wild Gaze?

A good GM understands that combats should be challenging but fun, and these are *not* fun. Again, this is on Normal difficulty, where the game should be most balanced between those two, but instead you're faced with repeated failure no matter how much you buff up before a fight, no matter how you position, or soften up the enemy with AOE spells. It's beyond frustrating.

I wanted to enjoy this game. I've been running Pathfinder games for over a decade now, and I love the system. But this... This is just bad game design. Frustrating, not fun, and not worth the investment of time required.",1685595829,1685682988,False,4,0,0.510178148746490479,0,True,False,False

The good:

+ Just like Wrath Of The Righteous (which is an easy 9/10 for me), the story is fantastic.

+ It's LONG. You can sink 100+ hours in 1 playthrough.

+ Real RPG choices with very distinct outcomes (as opposed as ""different choices"" that always seem to result in the same outcome -> looking at you, Bioware)

+ The character and character developments. Not just the companions but 3rd characters that don't join your party have very good stories.

+ Varnhold's Lot DLC and how it ties into the main campaign.

+ Adventuring and exploring a vast map, but also managing your lands and making pretty cities and towns, and of course just obliterating enemies. 

+ Too many choices for character creation, just the way I like it. :)

+ Very high replayability. Finish a game, make a new char, and your run could be vastly different from the previous one.


Ok, now let's get on with the bad... and remember 99% of this annoyances can be avoided if the mod ""Bag of tricks"" is installed. However, let's review for the vanilla version...

- Unskippable cutscenes. SIGH.

- Every 2 steps in the main map will result in an ambush or having to rest.

- Timed quests.

- That mother******* House At The Edge Of Time... you tought the Abyss city in WOTR was trying your patience... LOL (sobs.)

TL;DR:
If you've played and enjoyed Pillars of Eternity and Baldur's Gate, you'll probably like this one.
Game is really good when it's good, but there's so much tedium in-between and the writing is dogshit:
1. Resting is fun and quirky the first 10 times, not the other 1500.

2. Kingdom building feels interesting and impactful until you realize it isn't interesting nor impactful and is just a moneysink.

3. Did I mention the writing is dogshit? The main issue isn't that of characters being really anal about the dumbest shit, it's that you have no option to ever address anything. The story is alright.

4. Alignment system is kool and quirky, it's also fucking stupid to use for anything other than arbitrary damage/defense types. Is Electricity a philosophical fucking perspective? No, cause that'd be retarded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Seems like a small thing but when you're forced to rest so damn often throughout the game and each time is just that little bit longer, it gets tedious.

2. A monkeysink that has zero crossover between the kingdom building and the adventuring; they're two completely separate games. It's not like settlement building in Fallout 4, but more like playing a watered down version of Fallout Shelter on the side, that pauses the main game and has to be addressed or you fucking die. Can be turned off but I'm no quitter, although my mental health did quit on me a few times. Just turn this shit to auto after your first 40 minutes of trying to test it for value and game goes from 6/10 to 7/10.

3. Why the fuck is Jhod still in my kingdom? I don't trust that sniffer, I bet he's hiding something. But game forces me to suck his ballsack because he's meant to be an advisor? Characters with sharply contradicting and extreme perspectives are good, they're fun; they're so fun they're fun and fresh. 
But only if you can be the voice of your own reason and address the dumb shit that shouldn't fly.

4. Alignment only makes the slightest sense as a tracker for past deeds, not as a guideline for future actions. Granted, that is how the game uses it in theory, but in practice the writing feels like it's based around an obsession of cramming arbitrary alignment labels onto a certain quota of textbox options every conversation.

After 350 hours, I'm revising my review from Negative to Positive. If I could give this game a Mixed review, I would. I think that would be fair. 

[b]The Details[/b]
Why does it deserve a positive review? Why does it even deserve a mixed review (if there was such a thing)? For starters, there is a good party-based D&D game in here, and if the player can grasp the complex and punishing kingdom mechanics and forge ahead with a bit of foresight, then yes, it's possible to have fun. Quite a bit of fun in fact. But that last part is key: foresight. 

[b]Crystal Ball[/b]
In all my years of gaming, I've never played another game where foresight/foreknowledge made such a huge difference in my ability to enjoy a game. Kingmaker is designed in such a way that it is [b][i]easy[/i][/b] to make one wrong mistake and spiral into a ""Game Over"" situation. This most commonly occurs with the Kingdom management portion of the game, but it can also happen with character builds and quests. For a game that takes over 100 hours to complete, it should be designed to be more forgiving. There should be more advisor options, for example, and the developers really should have reduced the time to perform certain events; 14 days to ""upgrade"" an advisor is far too long and too many catastrophic events can take place during that time frame. It is possible later on to reduce this to 7 days, but that still creates a situation that makes it far too easy to fall into a death spiral. 

[b]Closing the Knowledge Gap[/b]
Given the drawbacks to this game, one might wonder how it could possibly be [i]fun[/i]. Well, the answer is knowledge. Either via guides & community help, or simply by playing the game and learning from mistakes. Myself, I have an Excel spreadsheet where I've put all my notes for Kingdom management, encounters, class builds, and advisors. I have to reference it a lot, but it works. It lets me focus on adventuring with my party, because now I have the answers and the foreknowledge to deal with all those situations that could cause a death spiral. 

[b]What's Good?[/b]
At this point in the review, I'm sure people are wondering why bother. Few people probably want to maintain an Excel spreadsheet, or an elaborate page of notes, to play the game. Valid point. For me, the reason I keep coming back is twofold. 

First, the companions are actually pretty great. Behind Baldur's Gate 2, I think this is the set of companions I enjoy the most. They are a thousand times better than the awful companions in Wrath of the Righteous. Everyone is basically fun in their own peculiar way, and the party banter is entertaining. Regongar & Nok Nok, in particular, are hilarious, and their interactions with the other party members are golden. Much like the BG2 companions (Minsc, Boo, Imoen, Jaheira, Viconia, Edwin) I simply miss these characters when I don't play the game for a while. And that tells me that they're pretty great. 

The second reason is because, in turn-based mode, this is a damn fun rule set to play with and there are a hoard of encounters in this game (it's 100 hours people!). It's quite fun to watch your party, and your class builds, grow up from level 1 to level 20. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
It has some very hefty drawbacks, true. But the vast majority of the problems with the game can be overcome with knowledge and judicious use of save games (save, and save often, and be prepared to go back to a prior save in case a kingdom management task goes awry). The flip side is, the companions are memorable and fun, and the encounters are good. The story takes place over 7 chapters and in that time you're going to see a lot of different enemies, story arcs, and bosses. If you can acquire the knowledge & patience necessary to deal with the kingdom management, then the rest of the game is worth it, IMO.

I enjoyed myself for the most part.  The game is a lot more fun when played with most of the pathfinder ""haha f*ck you start over"" mechanics turned off though, as it is an AD&D game full of AD&D f*ckery, and it will happily kill off your favorite dude or destroy hours of progress via one bad behind the scenes dice roll, so either save heckin constantly, or just turn of the f*ckery mechanics from the jump.

Its so long, boring, and disinteresting that after playing through everything else in this byzantine nightmare, I never actually finished the game on account of how absolute sh*t the final dungeon is.

I've played D&D pretty extensively and dabbled in other tabletop games as well. If this game is representative of the Pathfinder system, I think I'll enjoy it quite a lot. However, it'll be a hard sell to the more casual audience because of the crunchiness of the system itself. If you can deal with it, there's a lot of fun to be had.

Because this is a Pathfinder game, the system itself is gonna be a talking point. I personally enjoy it for what it is, which is an optimization rabbit hole. There's tons of depth to the system and making a powerful character. However, when you see your level-up screen, you'll be confronted with a massive tree of icons and symbols that take a while to understand. If you're not familiar with TTRPGs and how characters level up, the game certainly doesn't do much to explain it to you or help you understand it. The closest you get is an ""automatic level-up"" for companions, since the game has pre-built characters with specific initial classes, and unchangable backstories. After all, you're the main character, and the game can't decide your class for you. You're left to figure it out on your own. This is both good and bad, depending on your preferences.

Let's talk a little more about character optimization. As of writing this review, my companions are roughly level 11 (out of a possible 20). I feel I did a decent job optimizing, since I'm familiar with TTRPGs. However, sometimes the game can be extremely challenging. There were several points in the game where I told myself, ""I must not be high enough level to attempt this area yet"", as some story-relevant enemies were borderline impossible and took several reloads to beat - not willing reloads, but party wipes (more on that later). Or other signs, like certain skill checks were actively impossible for my characters to succeed at. Dedicated thieves with maxed out lockpicking skill would run into doors with DCs well above their max possible roll. I'm talking D20+24 - minimum of 25, max of 44 (from relevant stats, skills, and additional equipment) couldn't ever reach a DC of 45. I'm confused by this, and am not sure if it's my failure to optimize the characters, or if I'm genuinely supposed to come back to this area.

Combat is fun, but suffers a little from some of the standard crunch that pathfinder brings to the table. However, the combat system of Move Action + Standard Action + Swift Action is easy enough to pick up. My biggest hint - take your time, read your abilities, and organize your skill hotbars. It helps so much. 

If you can deal with making a character, the combat handily teaches you what skills are usable at what time with the rather handy action tracker. It tells you what actions you've done and where the skill you want to perform fits in. You also have the option of real-time combat and turn-based. Fans of the older Baldur's Gate series will hit their stride with real-time combat (the [i]true[/i] way to play, according to some), where if you're familiar with more modern games like anything produced by Larian Studios, you'll probably prefer turn-based. Glad there's an option. 

Now, let's talk about one of combat's biggest flaws: running away. If your character isn't built for stealth, running away is impossible and is probably one of the biggest flaws of the game. The combat takes place on sealed isometric maps somewhat reminiscent of Baldur's Gate, and if you're in combat, the game prevents you from leaving your current map. If you're in a losing situation, the only options are: reload a save before combat started (either by dying or manual reloading), or having every character successfully hide from the enemies (which is impossible if your character isn't optimized for stealth - see above). This felt especially weird with the extremely difficult combat at certain points in the game, and is perhaps my biggest immersion-breaker.

The story for this is top notch. It's presented in chapters (or questlines), and as of my current playtime, I've completed four and am on the fifth. Chapters one through four are top notch, and are some of the most invested I've been in fantasy game for a long time. There was a point where I played roughly 45 hours in a week, which is more than I work at my actual IRL job. However, at chapter five I hit a wall - most likely a little bit of burnout, but I think the scale of the story itself definitely contributed. Each successive chapter mounted a greater and greater narrative threat, but at some point, a roller coaster can't continue to go up. At some point it was bound to come down, and it kinda did - in a way that things kinda got so important, that the scale of the threat and the way the story was written just kinda lost me. I love this game and am super upset that this happened. 

It definitely feels like you're a king - the threats of the realm never let up. The main story, companion  sidequests, minor threats to your kingdom, all add up and you have to make choices. This started off easy enough. Your advisors automatically handle problems over time as you explore, taking a huge burden off your shoulders. However, the biggest questionable decision to me is the process for improving your advisors. You have to skip forward two in-game weeks to level them up, and I actually failed a main story quest and got a game over because I chose to level up an advisor. This kind of resulted in my advisors being underleveled, as while you are skipping ahead, you can't respond to any threats unless you cancel the level-up. As a result, the minor problems of my kingdom eventually got too difficult for my advisors to handle, even on the easiest difficulty besides auto-manage.

I've talked a ton of smack about this game, only because I'm super passionate about it. I'm super mad that the wonderful experience fell apart for me 90 hours in, but don't let my malding stop you. This game is worth every penny if you like TTRPGs, and would be an auto-buy all over again. Especially if you manage to catch a sale.",1684552503,1684553187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are also a lot of choices that matter and other things you'd expect from a decent crpg.

The music is ok, fitting but not something I'd listen to in free time. The companions are ok, but most aren't that greatly written or memorable, with couple being annoying. The worldbuilding is great, as expected of pathfinder.
The combat is...well, playing turn based on normal difficulty, it was generally easy but some encounters got really tedious...fighting several dozen enemies and waiting until every one of them finishes their turn.

Some tips:
-Always attempt more difficult skill check roll as it gives much more exp, late game exp from skill checks goes into dozens of thousands
-Don't take kingdom automanage option
-If some encounter is too difficult, feel free to explore and come back later after leveling up
-Pay attention to weight limit as it influences your travel speed, don't get burdened carrying around trash you will have more money than you need sooner or later anyway.
-Don't worry about doing things your companions don't like, there is no companion approval here and they will never leave you.

- very crunchy system for hardcore cRPG enthusiasts
- audio-visual representation and user interface
- old-school cRPG with lots of freedom of choice

Cons:
- requires deep understanding of the PF1E system
- unforgiving encounter design
- kingdom management sub-game consumes a lot of time

Kingmaker uses the rather complex Pathfinder 1E d20-based system, where the difference between attacks hitting 95% of the time and hitting 5% of the time is relatively small. This can lead to frustration until you understand how to stack bonuses correctly to make effective builds. Higher difficulties require buffing before fights and min-maxing bonuses and picking the right feats, which takes time to learn so that the first play-through can be rather rocky. Nevertheless, it can be very satisfying when your party hits its stride and enemies start to melt away. At the same time, the strategic complexity is somewhat limited as neither the party AI or enemy AI are very good.

The sound and graphics are very good for such an old-school game. The isometric view is immersive enough even without full voice acting or 3D cut-scenes. The soundtrack is excellent, each area has its own music and there are variants themes depending on the time of day. The graphical atmosphere changes according to the season and time of the day, and the lighting and audio reflection effects in the dungeons provide atmosphere without becoming a tedious gimmick. Battles in real-time feel fast-paced and visceral whereas turn-based mode is more strategic. There are some old-school ""traps"" that will catch you out on the first playthrough, and many areas need to be avoided at low levels. People used to level scaling of monsters may have an issue with this. Boss fights tend to be gimmicky and solvable through targeting their weaknesses rather than brute force.

The kingdom management mini-game is the most frequent complaint about this game and does influence the pacing of the main story considerably. You may need to read some guides to avoid an unrecoverable game over state as the difficulty of it ramps up by the end. It does also drag on for a few too many hours. The plot follows the table-top action path with some additional twists and turns. It starts off very slowly and the mystery is only slowly revealed over the course of dozens of hours of game play. Side quests exist to tell the story of the companions, all of whom are memorable. The story takes some rather bold turns in the final dungeon(s) depending on your choices, which many players didn't agree with, but I found them interesting as they added stakes to the ending.",1684521256,1684521256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Does it have an interesting story and interesting characters? Sure.

But after close to 15 hours played, I have come to the simple conclusion that I am simply not having fun.

I understand of course that games in this genre tend to not be for me due to their pacing, but I loved games like: Neverwinter Nights, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Dragon Age: Origins. Story-driven RPGs are not something I shy away from, but this game unfortunately suffers from being paced extremely poorly (at least as far as I went).

My biggest problem with this game isn't its difficulty, or its story, or really any individual component (which I have only seen a fraction of). My biggest problem is the fact that despite being a supposedly free-form RPG, the game just has far too many scripted things in it that can instantly defeat you around every corner - necessitating you either save scum like a champion or you play on a trivial difficulty level. 

A proper tabletop Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons adventure wouldn't have a high-level deadly mage show up to attack your party as you sleep in a camp while fighting Kobolds. A proper campaign with a competent game master would have encounters that are reasonable for your level, and harder challenges would at least have the option of escape or using some other strategy. Because it has been figured out decades ago that if you want players to be immersed into ""role-playing"" and actually want to show up consistently for it, you need to ensure that they feel their decisions have weight and that you don't pull things out of nowhere.

But in this game, such concerns are irrelevant - because save scumming seems to be built into the fabric of the game. An RPG which requires you to save scum to make reasonable story progress because it doesn't properly tailor encounters to your level or give you any hint that you will suddenly be fighting ultra enemies (which often look the same as low level ones), isn't an RPG that I can feel I am ""role playing"" in. It just feels like playing a single-player MMO.

This breaks my immersion greatly. Needing to save scum back 2 hours prior to my current situation because I'm inexplicably not able to handle the next quest without doing side-quest grinding I had no way to know I needed, isn't fun. 

I want to love this game, but I can't in good faith recommend it if you feel as I do that immersion in such a game is key.",1684403471,1684403700,False,9,0,0.542833030223846436,2,True,False,False

Beyond that this game was mega fun! The character creator is pretty good and the variety of classes are awesome!. For a first playthrough I do recommended turning off well death and lowering some of the difficulty. If you have played or heard a bit about Pathfinder TTRPG you know it's a game that leans more into building a character that is strong unlike DND which you can build a weak character and still be fine. So with that said make sure to have a good balanced team and again nothing wrong with lowering the difficulty just have fun with the game. A lot of this stands but when you reach end game you'll be sent to a palace puzzle that made me want to just quit. It takes away your companions and some can survive and come with you while others is just tough and you'll lose them why? Not really sure there's teleporting fog everywhere which takes you to a second version of the map so maybe you have to be in the right version to get your companion but I did this and only managed to save the hunter so don't take my word for it.

As well as the puzzle the enemies in The First World are fey and are pretty overpowered with the ability to just paralyse your characters and kill them off. The Final boss is also just meh with 3 choices Be wary of the power they offer, take the power happily and tell him to beat it. I just can't recommend you sink so many hours into this game only to have the game screw you over by taking your fav companions and giving you a mediocre final boss.

It's like busy-work to pad the play time because the DM didn't do any prep for that session.

JFC... if it was possible to instantly teleport around the levels it might not be so bad, but having to slowly ""run"" around big ass maps to try and figure out puzzles when you don't even know you're in one is the exact opposite of fun and relaxing.

Also the exact opposite of fun and relaxing is the amount of micromanaging of character abilities that must be required to try and make use of the party's full-suite of abilities since the AI clearly isn't up to the task. The Pathfinder 1st Edition rules and 2018-era AI quite simply were not well-suited to this sort of adaptation.

I played the game using the turn-based mod, which is phenomenal.  Although I would have enjoyed it without the mod, it would have been far less enjoyable for me.  Combat is deep, and it take into account the many different tactical aspects of feats, skills, spells, etc.  Character development is detailed and deep.  The companions are interesting and all have their own stories and quests.  There are many complaints about timed quests, but I like having time mean something in a game.  I never found the time constraints to be so limiting that they ruined the experience.  Some quests gave you a clear indication of how much time remained to complete the quest, while other quests didn't give you much warning at all - this needs to be standardized.  I really like the story, which was totally appropriate for Pathfinder (it wasn't as heavy or abstract as Pillars of Eternity).  The Kingdom Management was a fun distraction, but seemed to be an afterthought when compared with the rest of the game.  Many of the design decisions just didn't make sense.  For example, requiring the player to ""fast forward"" two weeks of game time to have certain kingdom upgrades take place instead of having them happen during normal game time progression like all the rest of the events.  Concepts like unlocking new advisors and other benefits are not well explained at all (not even in the in game encyclopedia).  But the biggest problem with kingdom management is that you don't gain really anything at all from building your kingdom, but you can lose the game if you manage it poorly.  So the only motivation for doing it is that it's a somewhat fun distraction, and you will lose the game if don't manage it well - there needs to be more to it than that.  That said, the rest of the game more than makes up for kingdom management.  I highly recommend this game.

- Are you meant to play with a guide open at all times telling me where the 'gotcha' fights are that 'You should avoid until you're x level'

This was a very good idea. 
BUT.
The whole thing is a mess, full of bugs, forcing you to restart the game frequently, not allowing you to save during combat so if it bugs during a combat, you have to start over.
Some of the bugs are that you cannot cancel an action but if the action cannot be done for some reason, the game will not allow you to continue to play. It will wait until the action is done and if it isn't done, it will wait infinitely.
Some other bugs are from the main quest. You have to find the father of a bad guy.  He is imprisoned in a room. I save, I start combat because simply opening the door start combat, and then... you can't enter the room. So you let the bad guy buff himself to god mode and at last, when he finishes, instead of going out, he fires a spell : whole team dead.
Loading back the save, one of my character is stuck INSIDE the cell... 
Other than that : some actions stays on your mouse even if you don't want to, so you are forced to heal people more than once or to cast a spell more than once because it bugs a lot and you cannot remove the said action.

That, plus the fact that there are a lot of problem of rhythm, makes this game really complicated to  handle correctly, and that's without counting the game engine. (because I am really familiarised with D&D)

The effort is remarkable, guys, but you should have polished it a bit more before saying ""this is finished, let's produce it"".

I have also a problem with icons of spells and effects : same icons for more than one spell, so it is sometimes difficult to understand what's happening. Seriously, ordering a 2D graphic artist to make enough icons, that was too difficult for you?

I won't even talk about weapon proficiencies, skills and feats in generals : one of my character has ""exotic weapon proficiency"" but it doesn't say which one. Or when you level up, sometimes it gives you twice the same feat. Or my elven character than can't equip an elven sword even if she has ""elven weapon proficiency"" but the said elven weapon is ""exotic"". Because it is clear that an elf can use any martial weapon like a flail or a warhammer but don't know which end to hold when facing a curved ELVEN sword. Even though she has ""Elven Weapons familiarity"" but HEY, who need coherence now?)
Oh, yes, and let's not forget the ""charge"" function, that doesn't work most of the time because there must be a pixel in the way or someting.

At the end, I end up with a bitter taste in the mouth while playing this game. It shows us what it could have been, but lacks to actually... being it.

It's like a beautiful movie with very bad actors or very bad writers : you can't stop thinking it could have been so much better, but it's really not enough.",1683820495,1683986981,False,0,0,0.467770814895629883,0,True,False,False

It's also kinda bad. 

On one hand, it's an incredibly ambitious gem that is an absurd showing for the dev's FIRST GAME, and on the other, there are a few quite poorly implemented systems. Strangely tight time gates and unpredictable consequences in kingdom management, and city building being almost entirely irrelevant outside of teleportation circles and a few static buffs, to name a couple. 

There a substantial learning curve, especially for people unfamiliar with Pathfinder, myself included. Those familiar with D&D mechanics will have a leg up, though enough is different that the crunchier aspects of the system might be rough for some. My first character hit a difficulty wall about 25 hours in, and I ended up starting fresh and having a much better time. Fortunately, the game is highly adjustable, and most of the things I've mentioned can be simplified or changed in the menu. For those who aren't planning on turning dials to find their niche, this game has some brutal difficulty spikes if you walk into the wrong neighborhood, and sometimes that neighborhood is right next to other dirt easy encounters. That said, if you know what you're doing, the vast majority of the game is completely trivial on normal difficulty, which is practically a genre staple so I'm not calling that a complaint. 

As for the good, this game has a wonderful experience of adventure and progression that kept me going to see what was next. Once I got the hang of it, there was a lot of fun to be had in the Stolen Lands. Choosy as I tend to be with CRPGs, I give this game a cautious recommendation.

Namely, the boss fights became more and more unreasonable. They started reasonably enough, with moderately tough but fair enemies that played by the same rules as you did, with strengths and weaknesses that could reasonably be assessed midfight and weren't too punishing if you didn't have something to exploit that weakness. However, towards the midgame things start to become painful. The boss fight against the Troll King combines an annoying caster with unlimited usage of buffing spells with a relatively high AC, high attack bonus, high damage, and long reach enemy with regeneration that only seems to be disabled properly sometimes when hit with acid, which is supposed to stop regeneration. Candlemere island is outright adversarial DMing, with enemies that spawn in after you walk through where they will come out of hiding so you don't accidentally spot them before they can nuke you, and get an ambush with high damage lightning bolts off because their stealth skill is actually impossible for a party at the level you will be at when you will go to the island. And when you get to the tomb of a certain barbarian's tomb, all pretense of balance are thrown out the fucking window. If you didn't spend several hours just researching how to power build every character in your party to the point of optimization because you're not a power gamer with 500+ hours of experience with the pathfinder system, then even at the lowest possible difficulty you'll still end up getting throttled by a roided out barbarian with enough attacks per minute and a high enough damage output to devastate a decently built tank in 3 turns, and then move on to the rest of your party. And the final act? FUCK that. A naga with an AC over 40 with unlimited spellcasting which will be used to cycle through various ""fuck you, die"" spells and occasionally cast Heal to completely undo whatever headway you could actually pull off. THEN there is the House at the Edge of Time. Two bosses in that awful dungeon have stupidly high ACs, high level casting with save or die spells and healing spells, and one of them can cast 3 goddamn spells in a single round. That's right. 50+ AC, high reflex save that allows her to ignore damage outright if she passes, a high touch AC, high initiative, decent enough fortitude save to disregard casters that aren't powerbuilds, the ability to summon minions into the fight an unlimited amount of times because she has no limits to her casting, and healing that will nullify any damage you actually pulled off, even at the lowest difficulty physically possible through game options. And she isn't even the actual final boss. It's genuinely not worth seeing the story to its conclusion at this point.

The game waists your time with a tedious management system (which is also never properly explained to you), with long travelling times, constant resting and fetch quests. There are many, many bad design decisions in the game (for example: quests failing without warning, the alignment system severely restricting roleplaying), but the awful Kingdom Management just kills it. 

The only thing that would've kept me playing would have been a good story, good companions and good quest, but the game delivers none of these. Quests are either boring, suffer under bad dialogue and the alignment system or fail for seemingly no reason anyway. Companions do not have any real depth - they're just cliché archetypes.

However, this Pathf. Kingm. has an extra kingdom management module as well. This is a pioneering feature in isometric rpgs, so this can still be improved on, as many elements are not self-explanatory, and you have to go back to FAQs or wikis a lot. 

For complete newbies: in P:K you not only manage an adventurer party, but also a fief or kingdom, but not from RTS perspective, but through the eyes of your main character. 
You have to consult advisors and you have to send your legates to certain automatic quests.
The only game which had similar management features I can think of is: Dragon Age 3, but there you only controlled one fortress, here you have one city and many villages. This game is more complex than DA3.

This kingdom management feature completes very well the usual adventure rpg gameplay, but it needs to be chiseled a bit, as it is not completely smooth yet.

The story is epic and even occasionally surprised me, but it's 30 hours of story (at best) spread out over like 80 hours of game. The dialogue is functional, but uninteresting. Characters are all one note. The philosophy behind the writing isn't very interesting- I expect better rhetoric out of CRPGs. Example: Hurrim. Expected: Werner Herzog as a cleric. Got: Sad guy who literally says neutral a lot. No nuance.

Three problems with combat:
No grid+ dumb flanking rules. Makes melee classes boring by removing most of the tactical aspect.
Waves and waves of enemies. Most encounters are ambushes and enemies will swamp you with debuffs unless you make sure you're fully buffed before each pull.
Little mob control. No taunts, no grid, it's difficult to intercept or block enemies. Enemies ignore AoOs to peel off whenever.

The reason combats focus so much on debuffs and grinding you down is by design: The game's about time management. They want you to rest often to make you hit the hidden timers constantly running. Wasting your time is an essential mechanic.

The game is bad about communicating with you. The encyclopedia is lacking and it doesn't have things like text links to help you learn the rules if there's a spell name you don't know. I had to spend literally hours alt tabbed to google stuff.

Oh, and let's not forget the technical issues. Lotta small bugs in turn based mode. Save file size creeps up as you play. Makes quick saving take awhile.

All of which adds up to you wasting a ton of time on some very mediocre content. If you're gonna play this, install a bunch of quality of life mods and do some research on character builds (and be prepared to look at the wiki a lot). Turn the animation speed way up high. Or just play on easier modes. Probably a healthier alternative.

I will point out that I saved maybe 48 hours play time by skimming a plot guide so that I don't have to stumble through 3 or 4 horrible endings to figure out which exact conversation or event each good/bad ending is keyed to. Glad I did 'cause in game, some of that **** is pretty arbitrary. Plot driven campaign is timed (WTF?) Some of the side mechanics and mini game stuff is fun for a bit(kingmaker), get's kinda repetitive but it's something to do. Not an open ended experience and doesn't really encourage replays due to repetitive gameplay mechanics.

If you're a pathfinder junkie who knows the rules or your character inside and out, you might get more out of this game than I did. If you are a casual pathfinder player you will be abused and tested. If you approach this game with a table top mindset you will be punished. Repeatedly.

I'm used to playing games like Baldur's Gate and such and so I'm familiar with D&D like mechanics. However it seems that the developers have seem to forget how to make a campaign enjoyable and instead threw tough to impossible encounter one after another.

To give an example, the very first fight you're forced into, you can be killed outright without having having the chance to do anything. All that needs to happen is you rolling a lower initiative than the assassin and he gets a critical hit on you. 
Yes this is down to (poor) luck but this is extremely poor design. 
If you've just paid full price for this game and you get instant killed in the first 2 seconds of combat, you'e gonna be p*ssed.

It doesn't get any better. If you somehow survive the tutorial area, the first side quest takes you into a cave against a swarm enemy that is immune to almost everything except alchemist fire which you'll miss more often than not.
Again, another poor encounter design that should not be in the starting section of a game where a player is still trying to learn the mechanics of the game.

Here are some:
It's a great introduction to the Pathfinder setting, which itself is a great iteration of DnD (meaning it's not amazing, but it's fun).
The amount of customization to how the game plays is not super overwhelming, and it gives enough to work out how you can make the game less annoying.
The gimmick of cRPG with kingdom management is narratively intriguing no matter how poorly it's done.
It's so thoroughly set into making a ttRPG experience that it can serve as an intro to how table-top works, while not being too outdated to dissuade most people by accident. (but please use Divinity Original Sin to indoctrinate your friends)
The characters are all fun, and so is most of the prose in the game. Many encounters easily manage to capture that narrative itch.
The presentation is nice. You can see it yourself, it's visually well designed in most areas.
And it's definitely not the worst made game. It's not constantly breaking at the seams, despite having so many features.

But it still makes for a pretty shit game.

DnD was always a trash of a game. It's even worse when you make a computer run it. I enjoyed bits of Neverwinter Nights, and this is no exception. It's got enjoyable bits. But it quickly becomes a dull experience. 
You can slog through encounters in Turn-based mode. But you will quickly understand that the game balance will just make the least engaging experience. You will watch a DnD game play out itself, obnoxious rolls flashing on the screen. And you will understand why house-rules are the only thing that makes that game bearable. In actual role-playing games, you are getting together with friends to flex your creative muscles and have a laugh at this show of chance. It's a decision making tool. But in a video game, all you get is meaningless numbers and wasted strategy. There's no in-the-moment balancing and flavor. Just tedious nothing playing out while you clutch onto spell slots that will probably fail a roll anyway. You are at mercy of the game difficulty settings. And since the encounters are thoughtless and frequent, it will either be insulting easy, or hard without being challenging.
So you speed things up by switching to Pause-and-Play mode. And now the game literally just plays itself. The encounters get shorter and you will see a sludge of effects whether or not you decide to burn a slot or not. And eventually you level up enough that only the boss encounters sort of stand out, but only in comparison to the millions of dead NPCs that were there for a second. 

But bland combat can mean nothing to a good RPG. Which is why it's sad that the game comes so close to some nice Role-Playing experience.
Sad, because the constant slip-ups in game design makes it easy to notice how worthless any player input actually is. The game has big aspirations and it tried to chew all it could, but all of the food just fell right on the floor. Because the quests that are there just can't do anything, since the game is already too big to handle that.
Some examples:
The alignment system is a joke. It's there because the ttRPG has alignment, and it's a crucial part of role-playing in that sense. But the choices you sometimes get is arbitrary, and since there is only one campaign you can really do, anything that would shake up the narrative of an average consumer would make no sense. A DM would have to retailor the campaign in that case, and that just never happens. Even Mass Effect has better role-playing.

It's a cool game only because of what it tries. And it tries a lot. And so none of it can really be satisfying. It's as simple as that. It's a sad victim of feature creep. In that way, it's actually amazing that it isn't completely broken.
The clearest example of this is right there in the title: Kingmaker. The kingdom management. It's a cool idea full of potential.
And once you get to it, it's an interesting concept. If you let your imagination run wild, you get to feel that stress of managing a shitshow of fantasy dangers. It's a stress and added value to what the story is: the impact of what's happening in the world has all possible varying layers.
But it's just a part of a video game. It's a mechanic tacked onto an RPG. It can't have the intrigue of a full-blown strategy simulator.
Quickly, you will notice that it means nothing. It's there to add some busy work while you go through the campaign. It becomes padding in a game made up of so much padding already. It's a simple formula: a set of random events periodically appear, and you spend a resource and wait until a roll tells you if it's a good one or a bad one. Then you may have a resource to turn into another resource and technically have a slightly better kingdom.
And it's constant. And it's slow. And it never really matters, because it's all the same. It's a gimmick based on a simple formula with no challenge. It ends up just like the combat: mostly pure annoyance without any meaning. It's just some feature given to a video game. See how the dice rolls. Maybe you have good stats, or maybe you had to make concessions. 

So...
It's still a nice and full cRPG. If you are a jaded fan of cRPGs, this will end up just being ""another one"" you can get a playthrough or a half from. It's less of a diamond in the rough and more of a dirt ball covered in diamond sparkles, but that doesn't mean that it's not a waste of time.
If you are a weirdo who can pour 130 hours into something painfully flawed and ultimately mediocre, this is worth some bucks. But in the end, you may just wish that you ran a campaign of this in actual Pathfinder. Or just play pachisi with your family.

after killing the stag lord you are level 5, and do not really have a clear path to go. so i ended up soft locked in a random encounter of 9 venom wolves that are level 8(?). i had to lower damage taken to 0.2, and still barely won the fight. got lost again and had to fight 2 ferocious Owlbears where i got soft locked again and had to lower the damage again.
at that point i gave up. just go play Solosta Crown of the Magister (its on PC Game Pass if you have it) or wait for Baulders gate 3.

Really solid storyline with a great cast of characters and a interesting world space with decent world building. Its also one of the few games where running a barony later a kingdom feels like running a actual kingdom with the ability to select your advisors and having decisions impact not only the story but visuals as well. You can be good, evil or something in between. It is a lengthy title though and I strongly suggest to not take this game on until you have lots of time ready to put into it and no other distractions from other titles. 
           DLC wise I'd say the only one actually needed is the wildcards one as it adds some characters that I feel should be in the game story wise and are pretty op party members. Some of the issues this title has is its pretty unforgiving which tbh is expected for a crpg but I suggest using a guide because even small decisions can create serious situations and lock you out of certain things or may even screw you in the end game (do your best to finish companion strings as if you dont [spoiler] Most of your companions will either turn on your or straight up die in the process of the final arc. I was left with like 4-5 guys luckily I had enough gold to buy 2 mercs off of a guy whos basically there in case you have almost no party members but the cost is extremely high per hired merc. [/spoiler] ). 
        If you want the ""secret true ending"" you'll def need a guide. Its a lot of steps but its well worth the ending. Some of the other issues is poor optimization. I rarely had 60 fps I would often dip into the 45s even mid 30s during combat (sometimes just walking) and this game simply does not warrant this considering the graphics. The combat itself is interesting in a way. You have the option to play turned based or real time. I opted for real time as I didnt want these battles to last a millennia. In terms of depth I suppose you can get crazy with the stuff you can do but for the average player this combat is probably going to be a slog and boring after a certain amount of hours. Does not help that the game itself is pretty damn difficult especially on the higher settings. Thankfully you can tweak things if you must. There are some quest trigger bugs as I had certain missions not trigger for me despite meeting the requirements but it was not very frequent.  Despite these short comings This game is still worth a run soley for the really dope story line and even if you pay the full price your going to get a lot of hours out of this one. On the heavy sales this is certainly worth the cop. 
       Oh and save often and in different slots I've had to backtrack a few times because like I said unforgiving game.",1682473706,1682473706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, this game takes WAY too long to complete. I like long games. I hate when a game I really love ends. This game, however, does not at all justify its length. The kingdom management aspect of the game is basically nothing but padding. I didn't enjoy anything about it other than the dialogue decisions it offered. I would've just set it to automatic, however there are partner story quests that apparently require it to be not automatic so I wound up having to endure it. Even after cheating to speed that stuff up, I am STILL not done with the game at 162 hours. [spoiler]I only recently completed the Pitax chapter and killed Irovetti[/spoiler]. I do not plan on finishing this game. I've had my fill. I hear the next game mostly ditches this kinda thing so hopefully I'll enjoy it more. 

Edit: I have played the sequel for a while. They kept kingdom management and made it worse. It's now just an incoherent mess and it STILL has the ""you can make it automatic but some quests are still locked behind it"" restriction. Absolutely tragic.

Next up is the randomness. Look: I know this is Pathfinder - a DnD inspired game. It is MEANT to have a ton of random shit. That makes sense. I myself play Pathfinder sessions with friends and as much as it fucking sucks to roll a nat 1 and get nearly killed at the start of a fight, the fact that someone is actually able to dynamically adapt the events to the situation makes it fun and if I don't have a needlessly cruel DM I can know that I at least won't die if I play decently safe and smart in response to my poor luck. My experience playing this game, however, has made me decide that much of the randomness found in TTRPGs just do not belong in a video game; especially one that outright ENCOURAGES savescumming. Tons of the RNG is entirely arbitrary and can be bypassed with enough patience just by savescumming. Even if you had access to only ONE save slot it would still not change much. This game needs to remove a lot of the randomness and heavily restrict saving to save points scattered throughout an area you might visit. I believe that a lot of the randomness should just be outright ditched in favor of static requirements. If you don't meet the required stat, you just fail the save or whatever you'd be rolling. No randomness. You either have the stats for the action or you don't. Initiative is also too arbirary. I think there should be a speed stat for each enemy or party member like in Pokemon and the turn order is based on who has the higher speed stat. Now there's no need to bother savescumming for better turn orders since it's not like doing so would change anything. I'm all for accessibility options in games but with how lenient the save system is, it completely removes pretty much any stakes if I can just save every 2 seconds. Best case scenario? Future games would get both the less random and very random game modes. A win-win (though absolutely a huge undertaking).

Next is the cryptic choices for partner quest outcomes. It's way too easy for partner quests to take the ""bad"" route. Although some partner quests have pretty obvious ""good"" choices, it often takes like a single poor choice to completely fuck up the rest of the questline. From what I could tell, many questlines have tons of mostly meaningless dialogue choices and then there's one single choice within the span of 1-3 quests that will irreversibly cement the ending you get. There really needs to be some leniency. I don't wanna spoil a lot so I'll refrain from really talking about any here but I'll at least say that I'm still VERY butthurt about Ekundayo's quest.

Lastly is the balance. I don't know what the fuck the devs (or I) did but it feels like no matter how I configure the difficulty, it's either brutally hard to the point that it's just unfun and grindy as hell or it's straight up shutting my brain off. Much of the game after I believe chapter... 2? Was it chapter 2? It was whenever the funky plant stuff happens. Anyways that section of the game is like an enormous difficulty spike where it felt like a ton of my resources for combat were drained almost entirely just from 1 single encounter. I'd have to rest after every 1 or 2 battles. After gradually lowering the difficulty in an attempt to fine tune things, I couldn't really find a good balance. It was always either all or nothing for the difficulty. I think the game needs to have its difficulty take a more endurance based approach and I think that limiting saving your game would help with that a lot. Endurance as in how many encounters you can get through in 1 rest.

Overall, this is a very good [i]first attempt[/i] for a game like this. It very accurately translates a Pathfinder session into video game form... albeit for better or for worse (personally I feel as though it's for the worse). This kind of game absolutely has potential but future iterations need to focus on the main gameplay more and also ideally remove a lot of the arbitrary randomness and savescumming potential. It's not like a Pathfinder or DnD video game can't work without a real human DM; there just needs to be heavy concessions to accomodate the lack of one.

The concept is great. It has the feeling of a classic D&D RPG, which is what you'd expect from a Pathfinder game. The characters and the plot are interesting, the gameplay is fun, your decisions affect the story, and building a Kingdom is extremely satisfying. Pathfinder: Kingmaker is easily on par with Baldur's Gate. 

That's what makes the terrible execution of so many mechanics so frustrating. 

The first problem is the difficulty. You'd think adjusting the difficulty would solve that problem, but no. I'm at the very last dungeon and it might be unbeatable because I decided to play an Ecclesitheurge and the encounters are obviously designed for a high-level tank class. It's not just that the combat encounters are easier if you fully optimised your party, it's that the game will brutally punish you for making fun roleplay choices, and this often comes out of nowhere. Most of the time, you can let your party autoattack, so it's even more jarring when the difficulty spikes out of nowhere. The design of the encounters is such that lowering the difficulty won't change anything. 

The second problem is time management. You know how, in most RPGs, you have an infinite amount of time to save the world? It undermines the story's tension, but there's a reason why games are designed that way. 

Kingmaker has multiple quests that are on a timer. On its own, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Combined with a kingdom management mechanic that forces timeskips, it means you can lose the game, or at least lose resources, by accident. Add in events that basically railroad you into moving the plot forward and quests that are on independent timers (or imply they're on independent timers, but expect you to do something without telling you what that thing is -- I'm not sure) and you can easily lose out on content. The way some quests are supposed to work simply isn't clear. 

That big map full of adventure that you're supposed to conquer? If you take the time to actually explore it, you lose. All those options to develop your kingdom? Most of them will never pay off, and will be ignored so you have advisors available for plot-relevant kingdom events. 

You might be able to do everything, or at least most of the content, if you're intimately familiar with how kingdom management works and you decide to roleplay a certain type of character, but you can't expect that from a new player. 

The third problem is the way the game handles the alignment system. A lot of choices can affect your alignment. On its own, that's not a problem. When the game forces you to make a choice that affects your alignment and either doesn't give you any choices that match your alignment, or gives you choices that match your alignment and are completely stupid, it's a huge problem.

*Story rich
*Good character development - You could really become invested in your party members and start to care about their 'lives'
*Game length - Took me 128 hours to complete the game
*Music - The soundtrack is really nice. I think I read somewhere that the same person who did the music for Skyrim did it for this game. Which is very evident since one of the background musics was basically ripped right from Skyrim

Cons:
*Kingdom management - While on the surface it is a nice idea and adds another layer to the game it quickly became very frustrating because at about the half way mark through the game or maybe a little beyond most of the kingdom Problems became impossible to resolve due to a 0% change of success no matter who you assigned to complete it. I even had to invoke the Indestructible Kingdom setting at one point because if your kingdom fails it is Game Over and you have to either start all the way over or find a save file far enough back to try and make a difference. However again because of how difficult the Problems became that was unlikely
*Secret Time quests - Some quests had  time limits where you needed to complete them before time ran out other wise it was Game Over. Which is fine, but some of them did not indicate that there was a time limit but they were tied to those impossible to solve kingdom Problems. So if you just went about your adventuring business and didnt pay attention to that it was again Game Over.

The combat is fun and has a lot of variety and the story itself is great in my opinion. If you want a game that will take you 150 or so hours for a single playthrough (assuming you want to finish all of the side content), this is it. (Not to mention that then you can do it all again with a completely new character while making different choices while playing.)

Unfortunately, the game has some problems.

Firstly, while I personally enjoyed the kingdom management, it is quite superficial (you don't really have to build any buildings besides a few good ones which are the same for all towns) and can get quite tedious at times (such as giving you an overwhelming number of problems to deal with which luckily amount to you assigning your officials to deal with them, but it can still feel shit when the game throws problems at you while all of your officials are busy).

Secondly, the game can have drastic spikes in difficulty due to the nature of the game itself. See, the game is a direct adaptation of a tabletop RPG campaign and in those you usually have a game master who is in control of the game and adjusts the difficulty (either lowering it or raising it) on the go to make sure that the players are always having fun. This is absent here and it can be quite apparent at times.

Thirdly, the combat system is too complicated for its own good and I would've preferred to see the Pathfinder 2e system instead as it simplifies a lot of the pointlessly complex things (like which actions you can take during one of your characters' turn).

Lastly, fuck Darven, everything surrounding him is so incredibly moronic that words fail to describe it. I was so pissed by the ordeal that I ended up cheating in the items I was supposed to get as a reward (well not quite, you get access to a merchant who sells those) after siding with him even though I killed him. Devs, please never do something like this again, take a look at what Amplitude did with the Cultists in Endless Legend if you want to give rewards like that. Backers should be able to give you the core idea for a character/quest, not dictate the fucking thing.

Overall, while I did go on a bit regarding this game's problems, I do genuinely enjoy it and would recommend you to give it a try. It has a lot to offer and the learning curve isn't too steep, the only problem being combat (though for a normal playthrough you don't need to understand it in-depth, meaning that the problem kind of goes away) and character creation (there are plenty of guides regarding this and even pre-made builds, the game also has an auto-levelling feature, meaning that it will choose the skills, magics and stats it thinks will suit you best, which is good enough for a first playthrough).",1681660059,1681660123,True,11,0,0.662479579448699951,0,True,False,False

I've read you can avoid having certain companions die, but to doe so, requires specific choices throughout the game, which I already bungled. I would love to go on about this in depth, but I don't want Spoilers in my review.

You'll know when an area does not expect you to be there yet. This also makes it satisfying to steam-roll these encounters later, once your party has levelled up.
Turn-based is the best way to play this. Real Time combat is an option, but the companion AI is so stupid, they're really likely to get themselves killed easily. So it becomes an option only for fights where you are way overpowered.

I spent only 7 hours of my time on this game and I am still disappointed that it took me so long to realise just how flawed it is. I think I just wanted to believe it was something better.[/strike]

Or at least that is what I thought. But I am quite okay with admitting when I am wrong. 

That said if you are thinking about purchasing this game let me take the time to explain why I have had such a U-turn with my evaluation.

I love real time with pause games and I love RPG's in general. I GM a DnD campaign and have done for years so Pathfinder: Kingmaker seemed like a no-brainier to me. I think that coming in with this background and with certain expectations is why I took a quick dislike to the game. It is also why coming back my feelings have changed so much.

I made assumptions about my skill/ability to play the game. I assumed that given my experience with playing other difficult titles in a similar vein I would ease into this game like a fish to water. But this game can be very difficult in places, and you need to take the time to learn the system.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Excellent character customization options.
- Brilliant companion NPC design. Some truly unique and unforgettable companions. Also good voice acting.
- Deep lore and interesting setting. (Though not enough means to explore that setting
- Fun game play - especially once you have a kingdom to manage
- The great kingdom management mode makes me feel like I have the best of both worlds: a party based RPG and strategy/city building game. When I get tired of one I can move to the other which is something I really appreciate.
- Over world travel system; Just a very good system that actually matters and has a meaningful impact on your decision making.

[b]Cons[/b]
- Choppiness in difficulty: Easy one minute very hard the next
- Not a good enough resource to learn the underlying game systems rules
- No [b]world[/b] map So far as I can see. In a game so filled with political tension I [b]need[/b] to see the bigger picture.

[h1]Key Lessons Learned[/h1]

[b]It's not DnD.[/b] Pathfinder may have its roots in DnD, but it is a very different game. Many of the spells and abilities will have similar names but work completely differently. If you play a lot of DnD don't let the familiarity of these names fool you: always read the full description.

[b]You need to understand the underlying game systems.[/b] One of the biggest cons of this game in my opinion is that it doesn't do enough to teach you the mechanics of pathfinder. It doesn't even provide you with the means to teach yourself within the game. Pillars of Eternity is amazing at this and has an excellent system for breaking down all the mechanics at play so you can read them thought and understand what stats do and how that affects your chances of success. This game immediately gets you to make a character - as all RPG's tend to - yet doesn't offer enough information to the player so they can make a [b]""good""[/b] character. It is also an extremely complex and in depth character creation process with so many stats and rule inter dependencies. In my mind that is indicative of a good game, lots of player choice. Just remember that you will need to spend time to familiarise yourself with the core mechanics and how character creation works outside of the game or you might end up disappointed like I did initially.

[b]Save often.[/b] Need I say more. I should have learned this lesson by now!

[b]It requires a big investment of time.[/b] Many modern RPG's require a big time investment but you can push through the main story quickly if you like. You will be hard pressed to complete this game quickly. I have now put 40 hours in and am at the beginning of Act 2. Kingdom management is very fun but adds to your playtime.

TLDR: If your gonna play this game expect to get your ass whopped a few times so save often to help mitigate time lost, expect to devote time to learning how the game works in your web browser and take the time to immerse yourself in the story. Otherwise you may be disappointed.",1657576624,1681503743,True,0,0,0.463623374700546265,0,True,False,False

This is a really, really good game. To be honest, it's much better than I expected. It's substantial, but not heavy. It's long, but sufficiently varied to hold your attention. And most importantly, it's fun. Initially, it can be challenging, even intimidating: there's a lot to get your head around. But if you persevere a bit - and if you like this kind of game, obviously - it's very rewarding. 

The writing is excellent, the characters are good (much better than the Divinity games) and the story - at least in its basic premise - is refreshingly simple. All of this means you get invested early, and the game does a good job of keeping you invested. Combat took me a while to like, but grew on me as I progressed. 

This is probably the closest I've got to that 'Baldur's Gate' type feeling from any game since BG itself: the feeling of being swept up into an adventure. The cosiness of the campfire. The danger of the open road. The welcome warmth of a tavern. The reassuring chatter of your companions. None of this is new - but that doesn't matter. The game's strength is that it isn't trying to be too innovative or clever. It's taking a formula that has worked before and proving that, with some fresh eyes, attention to detail and a lot of love, it can work again.

Others may enjoy this game. I know there are people who do. I know this game is based on the Pathfinder table top mechanics.

Pathfinder was my first party based, turn based RPG. I have played other first / third person RPGs but this was my first isometric one. That being said, from however much I have played this game , the overall design is, for a lack of a better word, careless. I will elaborate on this below:

[b]Bad class design. Lack of class balance ....... [/b]

If a game has class selection, then every one of those classes need to add some value. Particularly in a party based RPG, all classes need to have a reason to justify their existence within the game.

The best way of ensuring this value is by specialising the classes itself. If a class is good at something, it has to be bad at something else.... There needs to be clear strengths and weaknesses for the classes. 

This class balance is non existent in this game. Specifically, spell / magic classes get it all while the classes that are not spell based don't even get their worth. 

The Fighter class is an example of one such lacklustre and redundant class. They don't have access to spells; so they have a weakness. But they cant particularly do much better in combat than other classes; and so no strengths either.

If the fighter class is removed from the game, most players won't miss it because there is nothing in the game that only they are good at; or anything that makes them valuable. 

That is a problem. Even if you have a variety of sub-classes, a main class, by itself, needs clear strengths to be valuable enough to the player.

There are few other classes which border near redundant as well.

[b] ...... and they are made worse by certain game mechanics:--[/b]

One of the situations where this is painfully apparent is if you play your character as a Rogue class.
The rogue seems like a fun class to play as. A sneaky, stealthy, glass cannon that moves silently about the battle field delivering hits. Their abilities require you to deliver certain types of attacks, which are best delivered while in stealth mode (a mechanic available in this game). 

However, the main character can never be viable as a rogue class because there are scripted events in the game that break you out of this stealth (because you are the main character). After which, if a fight occurs (which mostly will) the rogue has no skill available to activate stealth in combat and he will be delegated to the role of a regular fighter; for which he is not the best, because of low hit-points. 

And you can't prevent this from happening because these are scripted events.

....................................................................................................................................

OVERALL VERDICT:

This game seems like one where the developers started with a clear plan but somehow lost sight of it towards the end.

This game has some good elements and equally bad ones. These good elements are what makes me feel cheated even more. This game builds up your hope only to make you disappointed as you dive deeper.

Time management in quest lines are tricky. It can be stressful. Not for anyone looking to relax with a turn based game at the end of their day. Other people have reviewed this part; so not going into it in depth.

If you want to play as any of the spell / magic / magic-combat hybrid classes, then this game can be fun. But I like fighters, I like rogues, and this game doesn't do justice to any class that can't use spells. Its not for me.

After my first review, I played it again, I will play as a magic class only from now on, I paid money so I have to try and play it. But I don't think I can completely ignore the missed opportunities. A little bit more thought and this game could have been truly amazing.

The difficulty names are also all off, as the normal difficulties are blatantly unfair, the monsters all having been significantly buffed compared to the pen and paper version, and there being significantly more of them, with harder enemies coming earlier and more often. Of course, this is justified by it being a video game and being able to reload, but ultimately, unless you want the game to be based either on minmaxing or save scumming, either playing on an easier difficulty, or customizing the difficulty is recommended. (So it's good the game does have a rather robust customization for the difficulty).

Also, there are some really poor design decisions. For example: MAKE SURE TO CAMP ON LOCAL MAPS IF YOU WANT ROMANCE. If you (like me) regularly camp on the world map simply because it's easier, or return to your capital to rest whenever you're nearby, you'll absolutely miss out on critical romance scenes (plus just some fun character interactions in general, beyond the single line and retort you normally get). And finally, the end game is a slog, like the DM ran out of ideas and just built a huge dungeon hoping for a party wipe so they'd just be able to end things.

Now, with all of that in mind, the game is an epic undertaking, faithfully recreating the rules of Pathfinder, with a huge world, and a rather large amount of reactivity, including being able to murder just about everyone if you really want. Even though the last dungeon is like a brick to the face, the actual endings are pretty good about recognizing what you did, including more than a couple for which there is no obvious 'best' outcome.

It's definitely not for everyone. It's difficult to the point of being mean spirited, with a curve like a series of spikes that it's set out for you to step on, still has the occasional bug (although it's much better than release), has some UI issues, where things aren't always obvious, and has randomness so embedded in its core that even if you run perfectly you still might end up getting screwed over because everyone failed their saves at the exact same time, and yet, I still spent hundreds of hours to finish, even if it took me over a year to do so.",1681115849,1681115849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lacks the nostalgia obviously but the story is expansive and you can continue in any order you want. No A then B then C here. And your choices and even the order they are done have real consequences to you and your companions. Your responses to NPC's can push your companions away or pull them closer and even make some switch sides, leaving the enemies party to join yours. So no spam clicking dialogue or you could find yourself alone very quickly. 

Companions are good. I like some and want them with me on every mission and hate others and only take them on quests because they are useful. You'll find yourself going out of your way to complete the companions that you like story's and quests. And when the other one that nobody likes, complains that things need to be done, and you aren't helping, you will find yourself mumbling at them about being lucky they are even allowed to tag along and should just shut up.  This is excellent and to me means that the companions have each been given their own personalty and aren't just taken solely on abilities to min max alone. This is how companions should feel. Like part of a real party where not everyone gets along amazingly and are just the best-est of friends from the moment they meet, but much more realistic with each having their pros and cons and you able to forgive so many more cons if you like that person. You are however a party of adventurers trying to stop evil and survive, so for the most part you know you can trust everyone to have your back when the moment comes......mmm.  However despite what has been done really well with the companions there is one glaringly obvious mistake that looks like it will never be patched, which is just unforgivable. None of them have a hamster familiar, so major points lost there and all parties feel much weaker than any in Baldur's gate, because of this complete lack of hamster support and hamster war cries to stir the soul.

Combat can be very harsh, making sure your tank agros the enemy is so important. If they get passed the tank or the enemy comes from another direction your back line is gone and without the buffs from the back line the tank is not actually tanky. The most important spell in the entire early game is not some aoe fire spell or huge critical strike, but the free casting of a protective shield for +1 on saving throws.  Keep this up at all times or your companions and you will die, or at the very least be limping away barely alive. 

Add it to your spell bar by finding a little tab of numbers on the right hand side of the spell bar and clicking 0 for your free spells, these tiny spells are what makes empires fall and heroes rise.

Great game, had it for ages and only got around to playing it lately, and I'm now annoyed that I took so  long to do it. Looking forward to moving onto Pathfinder 2 and giving Baldur's gate 3 a go.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is an immersive RPG that brings the tabletop experience to the digital world. The game is set in a rich and complex world with a vast array of characters, storylines, and gameplay mechanics to explore.

One of the things I appreciated about Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the deep character customization. The character creation process is detailed, allowing you to build a character from scratch, choosing their race, class, abilities, and alignment. This level of customization makes each playthrough unique and adds to the overall replay value of the game.

The world of Pathfinder: Kingmaker is expansive and varied, with each area having its own unique flavor and challenges. The game has a day and night cycle, with NPCs following their own schedules and routines, which adds a layer of realism to the world. The main questline is engaging and has multiple branching paths, making each playthrough different.

The game is not without its flaws, however. The difficulty curve can be uneven, with some encounters feeling unfairly difficult, especially in the early stages of the game. The UI can also be clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate menus and manage your inventory.

Overall, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a classic RPG experience that will appeal to fans of the genre. The character customization, expansive world, and engaging questline make for an enjoyable experience. However, the game's flaws, including the uneven difficulty curve and clunky UI, may detract from the experience for some players.",1680623987,1680623987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

does a horrible job teaching you the Pathfinder 1e mechanics. does a horrible job implementing AND teaching its own convoluted Kingdom Management sim mechanics. uses the horrible Unity engine and basically requires mods for long term stability. (get Cleaner & No History Asap if you plan to play)

yet...im still enjoying parts of the game because it gives me small feelings of the Baldurs Gate 2 era. i feel like Kingmaker could have been an amazing success but Owlcat as a dev team didnt have the skill to pull it off. the writing isnt great. the story is pretty ok. but nothing feels special. almost nothing feels unique. there are a few fun companions though, too bad they are all built so horribly they wouldnt survive a real Table Top version of this module. but again...mods can fix that. but they shouldnt have to.

I especially enjoyed The Vanishing of Varnhold - great, challenging enemies, cool dungeon, grimdark plot, lore of the ancient times of Galorian and uncertainty who the misterious Vordakai was.

Kingdom managment wasn't all that bad, despite all the reviews I've seen on steam. It was tiresome at times, but nothing gamebreaking when you understood how it all works.

The biggest flaw was the endgame though. It really killed the joy of playing this game, as if it was designed by people who run out of ideas and decided to simply throw hordes of insanely overpowered enemies at you, give them game breaking abilities (wild hunt gaze - good thing I managed to get the right perk at 19 lvl for almost every companion), rince and repeat. Oh, and when you thought it couldn't get any worse they slapped a curse in your face - 40% chance to fail at basically verything you try to do.

If it wasn't for a couple things I'd be giving this a hearty recommendation, and if you're willing to deal with a couple things that in my opinion are a lot more painful than necessary, then I may still recommend it. First, the positives. The story is great, and it utilizes the Pathfinder world (Golarion) lore beautifully. There's a couple twists and turns with the story that are fun and well done. The characters are also awesome. You've got a wide array of characters with different world views and it all just meshes really well. They're well written, and the voice acting tends to be well done. The music is fine but forgettable. Also, if you like loads of options with building your characters you've got it here. 

Though that leads into my gripes. This is not a game for casual players who don't want to spend hours digging into the meta and figuring out how to optimize your party. There are so many options, and it's very very easy to make sub-optimal choices without realizing it. It's also incredibly rare that keeping your build simple (aka not multiclassing) is optimal. You want to make a Magus? Well better take a level in alchemist (for the mutagen and sneak attack) and monk (cha bonus to AC and a bonus to fighting defensively with the crane style feat), maybe several actually, and maybe you'll actually want to do most of your levels in Eldritch Knight. Why can't you just build a straight single class character? You can but again, it's rare that you're better off for doing so.

Even on normal this is relevant, as a poorly built party will get wrecked by some of the more difficult encounters, and often at that point it's a little bit too late. This game also subscribes to the ""it's your fault if you run into an area that's too hard for you, so leave and come back later."" world design philosophy. That's not necessarily all that bad, but given how hard the game is it can sometimes feel like that's half the game sometimes.

Going back to balance, a lot of the classes/subclasses have trap options that just suck. You know the balancing is bad when the same classes keep cropping back up as multiclass options in optimization guides independent of what you're trying to do. You're also often encouraged to go into THREE to FIVE subclasses in most builds. It's just ludicrous. To further compound this problem those same guides routinely write off entire classes as just being worse versions of others. Wizard got this treatment, which hurts my soul.

On a smaller note - the story characters tend to have poorly optimized stats. It's also common for them to be in some of the worst class options mechanically (like Valerie or Amiri). It's really obnoxious. Then there's combat. They really should have made this game turn based to start with, as it plays a lot better that way. But it wasn't built with that in mind, so fights can get LONG when you're doing them turn based. If you play real time, expect to have to pause often to micromanage your party. Like a lot. Like, so much micromanagement that if you're not into that at all then it disqualifies this game immediately. Don't play it if you're not excited about the idea of being completely unable to play through the game without a feverish level of micromanagement. 

Some combats you can just point your party at the enemy and sit back, like some of the more filler stuff, but the moment you get into non-filler you HAVE to manage every little detail or you'll get wrecked. You can argue that this is good game design, and normally I would agree, it just is a shame that it ends up being so painful here.

Here are some examples. You run into some skeleton enemies, your melee characters better have a blunt weapon handy or they're going to be worthless. You run into a swarm enemy, your characters better have torches or fire scrolls or something or they're gonna be worthless. You run into some wererats that like to cast invisibility on themselves, well you better have ways to mitigate the invisibility as well as the right weapon types or surprise surprise, you're gonna get wrecked.

The main upshot of what I described above is that each encounter becomes a puzzle to solve. But if your characters aren't built well, and you haven't prepped the right stuff, you're left to solve a puzzle without having the right tools to do so. You CANNOT build your characters the way you want. You have to build them the way the game demands or you'll get screwed. It's basically impossible to set yourself up for success without following optimization and playthrough guides. For most people, I recommend turning the difficulty down significantly so that you can be more flexible and less constrained with your builds. 

I do like the game's Kingdom management, but my feelings are mixed overall. They clearly put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it's super fun to go into your capital and see the changes in ""decoration"" based on your character's alignment. The mechanics themselves are fine enough without being overly complex. However after a while the whole thing just begins to feel like a chore, a chore that if you ignore will end your game. So... this goes down as a plus in my opinion but not as big a plus as I would have liked.

Anyways, after all of this what you're left with is a well written game with great game mechanics and a great story with a texas-sized cluster of optimization and micromanagement hell that just sucks the joy out of the entire thing. If that latter bit doesn't turn you off, you'll probably be fine. Have fun. I wish I was able to join you.

EDIT: I went back and tried again after writing this review. I quickly came to the conclusion that everything I wrote above was still accurate, said screw it, and modded the game. Turns out that turning the difficulty down, modding in full character respeccing (even for the story companions), and using mods to grant yourself the odd feat you otherwise would have spent 4 multi-class levels getting, make the game actually playable. So yeah I basically cheated. Though it made my enjoyment of the game skyrocket and I very nearly turned around to play through a second time. So make of that what you will.",1675366810,1680231979,False,6,0,0.520009696483612061,0,True,False,False

First of all, it doesn't tell you how to do anything, which is already pretty bad, on top of that the systems are confusing (also non-intuitive) , they also hide most of the mechanics so numbers (resistances and so on) seem to be random, and devs are a little fucked in the head when it comes to difficulty. both for kingdom management and combat. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE DC UNDER 16!!!! (that's like 50% chance for low level characters)
About combat
-the AI very frequently has a very interesting behavior (doesn't depend on type of enemy), they will focus your main character wherever he is just because killing him will give you an instant game over (no opportunity to revive just because)
-normal difficulty will give you loads of damage reduction because apparently they don't know how to balance
-at level 3 you will be in a fight where all your characters will be teleported to the enemy's area spell range for a dialogue, and he will conveniently have high initiative, when combat start (mostly him) he'll use a fireball and will unalive every non-tanky character and tanky ones will be close to dying. Fireball is a level 3 spell, meaning you need level 7 with a full caster to have it. That's just ONE example, this happens all the time.
Kingdom management
- This one is just bad, devs have a problem with DC and timing, when you put your advisors to work, they will be locked until they finish solving it, sometimes new problems appear and go unsolved because your advisor is still locked in the other problem.

In the next 24 hours the game started to feel repetitive, and the kingdom management started to feel like a chore, with the annoying red exclamation mark appearing every other day.
It was only during the hours 48-72 that I've noticed that the saving/loading times got longer.

I'm at hour 96. In the last hour I've encountered several somewhat demanding fights preceded by unskippable cutscenes. I die, I need to load the game, loading takes forever, because of the absurd decision of storing in the save files information on all the loot that you haven't gathered in the locations you've visited, I need to suffer the cutscene again, I die again, I load again.

I'm not going to finish the game, because I find the long saving/loading times to be extremely frustrating. To wrap-up:

1. For the game to be playable, you HAVE TO USE THE ""Cleaner"" MOD, which allows you to destroy loot when leaving areas, thus keeping savefiles at reasonable size, thus keeping saving/loading times as short as possible. It is beyond me why this particular issue hasn't been fixed in the fricking ENHANCED PLUS edition. I've learned about the mod too late.
2. If you make certain choices, at some point you might end up with one of the adviser positions lacking a suitable candidate for the rest of the game, thus leaving multiple ""problem"" events not addressed. This is a small thing, but still annoying.
3. There are long unskippable cutscenes preceding some more difficult encounters.
4. Enemies will target your mages even when the mages are out of the line of sight of all the enemies, say, hidden behind a corner.
5. I've played Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series lots of times, I've finished Neverwinter Nigths 1 and 2, and so the game's mechanics felt familiar and comfortable to me. I'm used to avoiding confrontation with stronger enemies until my party is powerful enough.

It took me 344 hours to complete, and a fair amount of patience and planning, If you like to read and explore, the game offers excellent content of lore and background of the stolen Lands in the pathfinder universe.

In general the quality of the story is good, some of the companion characters is averagely written, but the villans are well done and keeps you entertained.

I didn´t encounter any game breaking bugs, however a few silly spell conditions made some parts of the game mildly frustrating.

All in all a decent roleplaying experience, with a taxing gameplay.

I am no newbie on games like this, I´ve played both Divinity: Original Sin games, both Pillars of Eternity games and I am playing the Baldur´s Gate 3 early access, but in NONE of these games I´ve experienced the total nonsensical difficulty spikes that this game offers. 
Most of the time my Party is running around smacking everything left and right, without breaking a sweat, which makes me question, why I am playing on normal difficulty, but then an encounter comes along that makes me dread the day I was born.
Time for a little story buckle up.
Right now I am stuck on an encounter, where a trader has been trapped by some fey.
The fight begins immediately after the dialogue which puts my ranged characters in the front line. I´m not complaining about that, that´s just how ambushes are and you have to deal with that. But then 3 giant Treants rush my party doing 20 damage per hit on my front line who have like 70-80 hp each. After I deal with the Treants the bullshitting begins.
7-10 ""Redcaps"" spawn all around my party flanking every single member, doing lots of damage AND on top of that they´re harder to kill than a troll. You think that´s all? Nah.
An enormous Water Elemental spawns with a huge HP pool and also doing 20 damage per hit. By now my Cleric is rapidly pumping out heals to keep my frontline from being slaughtered but it is just way too much to handle. Oh, and that wasn´t all of it, there is also an enemy spellcaster ""miniboss(?)"" on top of the hill, rapid firing spells on my backline.
Now tell me how the fuck I was supposed to handle this on my first try? Does this game want me to save-scum so I can place my ranged characters on the hill? Fights like this happen often.
In Divinity and Pillars of Eternity I have always felt like I did something wrong, when losing fights, in Pathfinder I feel like losing fights and save-scumming is a requirement.

One last point, I know this game is based on D&D Rules or something like that but playing Warriors/Fighters is boring af.
They have no Skills at all and only auto-attack and occasionaly bull rush. No Whirlwind, no stun, no jump attack, no bleed, no 10-hits-combo special attack. Just click and watch.

I don´t want to be too hard on the game though, I had lots of fun in almost every other aspect of the game. Talking to your companions is interesting and fun, Kingdom management is kinda fun, the locations are fun to explore, the quests are fun and finding hidden treasure is fun.

I don´t recommend this game to everyone who is unfamiliar with D&D Rules and everyone who hates frustration in games.

EDIT:

After almost 2 years I decided to give this game another shot, since I pretty much played every other CRPG in existence.
After spending dozens of hours more in the game I realized some things, that I talked about in my older review up there.
Sadly the game didn´t get better with time. Enemy encounters became even more frustrating and unfair and the general urgency of everything, especially in the final parts of the game FORCE you to hurry up and not explore in peace. The game rushes you so much, that I turned Kingdom Management to Auto, even though I played 98% of the game on manual Kingdom management since I kind of enjoyed it. But the last Act was just not managable for me. My kingdom constantly had to endure -20 on all stats because I couldn´t win Problems that had a DC of 38 or higher. There are also 20 Problems every week, so you don´t even find the time to do any of the other Projects without enduring massive Stat decreases to your kingdom. I was genuinely afraid to do any Projects that had Time Requirements of 90 days, because I felt like I would need that advisor in the meantime way too often.

Well let´s get to the enemy encounters. The encounter I talked about in my older review is still bullshit, but this time I managed to arrive at a higher level and won. It felt like I didn´t deserve to win, since I pretty much ""stat-checked"" the encounter and did not do any strategic plays or something like that. Just plain old ""I have better stats than you"". Still ain´t no friend of gameplay like this. At Endgame the encounters get even worse than this (Looking at you Ghostly Guards and Mandragora Swarms). So let´s say we have some enemies that drain your stats or inflict Negative levels. Do you remember a spell that helped against this? Yes! The Deathward Spell! Finally I felt like I had the tools to overcome these obstacles. Well, guess what... Deathward doesnt work on these enemies... There´s the frustration I am talking about. What about Boss fights that have high stats and strong attacks? Sure, let´s debuff them! Well guess what... Their saves are so high that even a maximized Level 9 Spell has a chance of 15% to hit at best on their lowest roll... All of my late game fights were won because of Ekundayo and his high hit chance and Regongar and his Dimensional strike. Every other member of my party felt like amateurs trying and failing to hit a mountain with an arrow. Octavia, who was my main debuff/illusion/enchantment Character managed to hit around 3 Baleful Polymorphs in the entire endgame! My sorcerer had 1 spell that consistently worked on enemies (Finger of Death) The rest of my spells I could pretty much discard. And guess what again!... FINGER OF DEATH DOES NOT WORK ON ALL THE END GAME BOSSES, BECAUSE THEY ARE ""ImMuNE"" SO MY NECROMANCY FOCUSED SORCERER WAS FORCED TO SPAM LIGHTNING BOLTS AND HOPE THEY HIT.

Valerie reached level 18 at the end of the game and I waited for a single ability to use for fighter classes up until that point and it never came. Fighters are unironically the least fun class in this game that I have ever played in any game ever. There is literally 0 depth to them. Less than zero even. Valerie started the game standing in front of enemies and auto attacking them and she fucking ended it that way. Level 1 - 18 no progression at ALL. Nothing. The only thing that changed for her were her stats. I am not exaggerating.

This game is riddled with cheese tactics and exploits. Almost every YouTube Guide shows you how to be completely immortal and one shot everything because almost everything can be exploited/cheesed. If you like to min/max your character and feel like an absolute god you may get your enjoyment out of this game, but if you want to be immersed and painfully overcome challenges by your own, youre playing it wrong and the game makes you know it.

One last thing about the companions. Playful banter at a campsite is okay and appreciated and sometimes even winding each other up is amusing, but these companions, except a few exceptions, absolutely despise each other and it´s kind of killing the mood, when you should be growing together and becoming friends/rivals. Constantly belittling each other and then facing the end of the world together is kind of contradictory. I would at least warm up a little to people who saved my life countless times and whose protection I rely on on the battlefield. These interactions aren´t banter or winding each other up, they are just plainly mean and derogatory.

Hopefully Wrath of the Righteous has improved on this...

P.S. to all the fanboys down in the comments insulting me. Can you guys chill out? This was MY experience with the game. You may agree, you may not. I don´t give a single shit if you feel like ""I plAyEd tHe gAmE wRonG"". I played it the same way any other person who wants to get into D&D would have played it. I am not apologizing for not being that familiar with D&D as all of you are. Every other CRPG I played i praised to high heavens, because they were fair and challenging on normal difficulty and invited you to test your skills on harder difficulty.

[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]
Something seemed a bit off from the start, with environments feeling a bit 'sterile', and animations being a bit clunky. But sure, graphics aren't everything. The art in the game is stunning, and helps to make up for the lack of visual appeal in the actual game world.

[h1]UX[/h1]
The interface seems rather clunky, and often unintuitive. It's really hard to tell how mechanics work in the game, often being overcomplicated with no seeming explanation behind what's going on. A good example is the camp, where you get instructed to set the camp, but it's not clear how you actually use it. The mouse cursor doesn't change when hovering over it, which is one of the most basic elements of UX design. When you use the camp, it's not clear what you're actually meant to do. Do you reassign roles? How? What's all that stuff at the top? Some kind of calendar? Who knows. One of the many overambitious and underdeveloped features that this game has taken on.

Both turn based and real time combat seem kind of awkward. It would have been much better to have just gone for one and made it good.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Balance seems outright terrible, perhaps trying to adhere to D&D rules over providing a smooth gameplayer experience. It might suit someone who simply wants a digital version of D&D (not even sure it's close to that), but it completely lacks the creative and social aspects of that game, instead leaning too hard on a ruleset that doesn't transition too cleanly to digital.

[h1]Writing[/h1]
A game like this heavily depends on the story. It's pretty bland, and some of the characters give the impression that it was written for an audience that would think Twilight is a masterpiece.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Simply doesn't feel good or satisfying to play. Like many Kickstarter projects, ambition and promises can undermine quality. It's a real pity, as a considerable amount of effort seems to have been put into this game, and some team members have done a great job. Overall there seems to have been some poor decisions made in direction of the game. It feels like a rather hollow experience that in many ways takes a step backwards from even Baldur's Gate.

Instead, I'd strongly recommend Pillars of Eternity or Divinity for anyone looking for a Baldur's gate-esque fix.",1679346010,1679346133,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the good elements. The story, characters, combat, world-building, graphics, environment design, and audio are all top quality, so the ingredients of a good cRPG are present. You're going to be sinking a lot of hours into this game, and potentially a hell of a lot more if you're the type to experiment with different character builds and play-styles.

However, it's depth is a weakness, as well as a strength. For people such as myself, who aren't familiar with tabletop Pathfinder, the amount of mechanics and options available are STAGGERING, particularly because there's an overwhelming number of classes, sub-classes, abilities, and feats to choose from, made even more complicated by the sophisticated rules at play. I have yet to find a game that is able to translate tabletop rules in video game format, insofar as making the experience fair to the player. Just as I had issues with Neverwinter Nights 2, this title suffers from the fact that, if you build your characters in an non-optimised way, you will suffer from beginning to end. This is incredibly prevalent at the start of the game, where you risk spending a literal hour being stuck in a spider's web, or unable to hit your targets for X amount of turns, because of virtual dice rolls. As such, I spend more time looking up character build guides on the internet, as opposed to experimenting. I would never wish to suggest that developers avoid creating games in this way, only that they spend more time tweaking the experience to ensure it's more appropriate for a video game (IE. Pillars of Eternity).

If you have patience, then it's definitely a game I would recommend.

There are numerous enemy encounters you can fight where enemies cannot path to you so you can pick them off for free.

The way the game is articulated is to blame for that. I didn't have particular issues with the difficulty, fights or managing my territory. I am simply getting annoyed at how the game throws problem after problem at you, you can never be at peace and chill out, everything is on a timer, you can do so little at the same time... And damn is this game long ! I rarely find a game to be too long but it is the case to me here.

I enjoyed developping my barony at first, it was promising and interesting. But it turned out to be very tedious and long, quite simplistic and always interrupted by crisis after crisis you are forced to go solve (main story essentially, which can take 5-10h) or you lose. You have so few options for advisors, there is so much to do and you will always have them all busy with essential tasks you can almost never do side development or progress. New problems arise constantly there is no way to have everything safe and everybody happy. Everything is so expensive it will take a long time to gather the funds, you start with one village and region you earn around 33 Building Points (it's very little, some stuff cost 500-1500, for very little gain in return I might add), after 70h (probably 50h of having my barony) I have 5 regions 2 villages 2 towns 1 city and I'm still earning only 49 BPs per week (taxes take ~25%)... The progression feels really bad. 
I recently completed a long phase of the story to finally be able to go back and relax in my capital, resume the management. I come back to new problems, invasions left and right, all my efforts to have the general morale positive is wasted, turned into worry. I lost my councilor during the last quest and have nobody to replace him with (there are no candidates!!!), tasks to give my advisors went from 65-85% chance to succeed on average to something like 30-50%. The game is setting you up to fail. I get betrayed on top of that and face further maluses to my resolutions provided I fix the issue with... a councilor that I cannot replace.

No this is just getting ridiculous. After all this time played you will get annoyed by how long and slow the travels on the map are, having to rest all the time and getting attacked very often. I did enjoy the first 2/3 of my playtime but it is just becoming more and more of a chore on every level the further you progress.

I usually leave a longer/elaborate reviews for isometric rpgs such as this, but this time I will cut to the chase: It felt more like a chore to play, yet the quests, story and dialogue often culminated into something that gave me strength to go further. And I did, and I finished the game. Through annoyances, frustration and boredom, I wanted to move forward to see where the story goes, where it ends. I was gripped, yet the grip was not only tight, but also choking, painful and itchy. But if you find yourself not involved in the story and want to play for the sake of gameplay, might as well skip this one.

*sigh*, why cant these games be both interesting from story perspective and fun from gameplay. Is it really that hard to achieve both?

Nevertheless, I am giving the sequel a chance.

Even as I write this, I'm still trying to play and enjoy it, but the same frustrations keep coming up no matter how many websites I find info about it, no matter what settings are adjustable in-game...this game literally punishes you at every turn. 

Same complaints as most people on here. Very unbalanced fighting and it DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DIFFICULTY YOU PUT IT ON FOR IT TO BE UNBALANCED!!!!! So to every person belittling those of us pointing it out, you sound like arrogant, no-lifers who can probably enjoy the game because they are as confused about game making in the same way the Devs are. Even the Devs came out and confirmed how unbalanced many of the encounters are.
 
The resting system is tedious and could've been done in a less annoying and more creative way. Or just not at all.

The lack of direction in-game (or just really bad story writing/creation) causes the player to explore places they are not ready for and they get punished for it by getting locked in to an encounter they aren't ready to be in. That kind of repetitive frustration WILL MAKE PEOPLE STOP PLAYING. 

The running your own kingdom is also HORRIBLY UNBALANCED and the game doesn't even give you enough companions to run your kingdom so many of the kingdom responsibilities (quests) go unfinished which is also a repetitive frustration that cause one to abandon the game. Sure, you could PURCHASE mercenaries from an in-game NPC for $24000 GP...I haven't been able to reach 25k because I'm purchasing armor, weapons etc...can't even afford a bag of holding but I'm supposed to be able to afford several mercenaries? As Jojo says, ""Good grief...""

Pillars of Eternity did all of this way better in their first game. Maybe I'll go play that INSTEAD of this disaster.

Case in point - Viscount Smoulderborne.  One example of how this game is badly made is that it spawns mini combat maps and you have to click a compass symbol to exit the mini map. All good right?  Except there is a bug where sometimes they forget to render the compass symbol. You can save and reload the game and it works, but still- it's not a game in beta. They are working on the sequel.  Whoopsie.

So lets talk Viscount Smoulderborne.  You have a click to interact interface with the world. Like one click for everything.  Loot. Click. Camp. Click. Examine. Click. Interact... you get the idea. So my relatively weak 3rd level party is really exploring the map, doing okay, and there is a Campsite full of corpses horribly burned.  Okay, cool. I just want to loot the bodies and GTFO. but wait, it's one click for everything.  Lol. What a clever GM trap, I have accidentally camped and fallen asleep in a dangerous encounter. Which would be cool if I had a save file, but nope, camping overwrites the autosave, so I have no choice but to fight a disembodied godlike head lich with a multi spell 'kill everything' combo.  Basically I can redo the past three hours of game play or look for a cheat code, because my level 3 guys can't hit this thing.  Great.  So somewhere there is a game designer modeling the game play like a shoddy dungeon master and  as a player I'm just left to say 'wow, so clever.  maybe i should uninstall this POS.'

This game does a fair number of things right, but if there isn't a cheat code to fix this encounter, I am probably uninstalling.  Cascading garbage made out of pure fail.
EDIT: if you get stuck with Mourn whatshis name, go to options- difficulty, and put it on storymode. Same thing as a cheat code.  You get to play in nerf world and both miss a lot but he becomes hittable.

If you're familiar with the TTRPG, you'll have fun with the character building and combat here.
But as you progress through the game you'll start catching all the problems with kingmaker that make the game a less than stellar experience in other areas to say the least. Time management being one of the biggest ones, as the game tasks you with managing a kingdom, chasing down the personal quests of companions and craftsmen, handling side errands all while the main story progresses on a fixed and sometimes unfairly tight timeline, into which you're also expected to find weeks of ingame time to dedicate to kingdom upgrades and projects.

This is probably most exemplified in act 4, when you're tasked with finding armags tomb. This requires a DC45 perception check, at level ~13 or so (You're unlikely to have a character with perception above 20 at this point, effectively making it impossible). Further once you've ATTEMPTED this check by blundering past it on the way to do a sidequest in the area, you've failed it until you level up (not gonnah happen before you find the tomb), or complete one of the two projects the game gives you on the kingdom management level to help find it (and one encounter you can run into on the world map).

The problem here is the game also throws a handful of character side-quests at you at the same time. Since many of the quests in the game are timed either explicitly or covertly, you're trained at this point to do them immediately, typically starting with character quests and errands then moving onto main quests unless they're given an explicit timer countdown - and if you didn't IMMEDIATELY queue up one of the projects to find the tomb here, you've now screwed yourself over pretty hard because you're near certain to fail one of the first time sensitive objectives, and you're locked in since the time you need to reload to was over an ingame a month ago. 

The game is full of these situations where, unless you're following a wiki or a guide, you can lock yourself into or out of paths in the game with no real warning. Add on the fact that a single playthrough easily crests the 100 hour mark and you're in for a gruelling time. If it were a TTRPG, kingmaker would be one with a GM who will gladly let the party fail the campaign 12 sessions ago, then let them play the next 12 sessions only to end the game on 'while you were doing this other thing the evil lord ascended and everyone died lol gg'

At the same time, even those with the experience will still have a fair amount of research or restarts to find out where they want to be in the game. Oddly enough, the story DLC will be the best place to do R&D on you character and party
- The kingdom management mini-game is initially interesting, but eventually gets in the way as it something the game wants you to balance with adventuring, but it starts becoming a chore. At the same time, it doesn't have a ton of information to help you understand what is causing seemingly random events to trigger and how to resolve them. One can loose the game without knowing why from kingdom management, which leads into:
- The questing in the game is odd. Somethings make perfect sense and resolve fairly easily. Other things are ""bad event is coming up in X days"" with little to know information on how to complete it. If the player is fine with looking things up and reloading to resolve these issues, then it may no be an issue for some.
- Lastly, the game doesn't ""journal"" things that one would think should be entered into various aspects of the bestiary and quest lines. The player can inspect something like a zombie in combat, but the bestiary never updates with those stats once the player has that information. Quests are missing information, such as go meet this person you've met before, but no indication of where you met them previously or where you should met them to complete the quest (not all quests, just some)

The game is okay, but some people are going to hate it. If you can tolerate the missing information and having to do some reading outside of game, its worth the money, otherwise skip it.",1678718976,1678718976,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

One more thing, the turned based combat, there is no sembulince of verticality, meaning an enemy will be on a ledge above you, and you can't reach them, because there is no mecanic or button for you to climb the stupid latter that is literally in front of you.  There is at least 3 upsides though, the story is fun and interesting, the traveling mechanic is very unique and will have you wanting to explore, and there is a settlement building mechanic that's not ground breaking but isn't bad, however I don't think these upsides is worth the headache.

The bad:

It's real-time-with-pause.  I've been spoiled with Divnity Original Sin, Baldur's Gate 3, Solasta + Stolen Realm recently.   I just don't enjoy RTWP tactical.  IT's very very fiddly if you want to, e.g. control your Fireball to not hit other party members.  It reminds me of Neverwinter nights, but not in the good way.  In the ""let me buff and just watch combat happen"" way that seemed optimal.  As such I wound up turning to story mode halfway through, because the combat was that boring.

Additionally, Pathfinder 1e is fiddly with builds.  Luckily I had experience with those and was able to make some optimal characters.

These things combined almost had me stop playing until I realized I can story-mode, AFK most fights and get to the meat of the parts of the game I enjoy.


The Good:

The kingdom building is fun and rewarding.  The storytelling is great.   If you consider this a ""go fetch quest"" while building characters and stories and expanding the stats of your kingdom, it's still enjoyable, even if the ""prime focus"" of gameplay (combat) is not.  I think that's a testiment to the game developers.  I'm currently playing a chaotic good ruler and taking the chaotic option has been destabilizing my kingdom in very satisfying ways.  I really love the thought and attention to detail on that component of the game.


TL;DR;

- Fun exploration

I just can't recommend this one though. I am a huge fan of the old Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale games and since it doesn't look like we are getting more releases in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, I am always looking for something that will scratch the nostalgia itch. I have never actually completed this game and instead have started and stopped several times.

I will start with what I liked: unlike some of the other reviews, I actually liked the combat system. I suppose you could say that it is difficult to master every class since there are quite a few of them and some are easier to master than others. It isn't hard to have a basic party and be successful though. One of my criticisms of Baldur's Gate is if your mage spells are depleted, you have to use conventional weapons. I want my spellcasters to always be able to cast spells. In this game, wizards have a basic, magic based attack. Doesn't do a lot of damage later in the game but better than having your squishy wizard rush into melee when they run out of spells. I like the kingdom management concept but I thought it was poorly executed. Thankfully, this aspect can be set to automatic so it isn't a huge deal if you don't want to mess around with it. Kingdom management is fine in the beginning but gets progressively more irritating as you go through the game.

As for what I didn't like, the most important component in an RPG, in my opinion, is the writing. The writing for the basic storyline is fine and unlike Pillars of Eternity, you aren't getting massive walls of lore text. The character dialogue is terrible though. I can't say that there is a single companion that I look at and say, ""Wow. That is really compelling, engaging character."" A few were neutral/okay but some of them were just weird. Two of them wanted me to get into this weird cuckoldry 3 way relationship. Um, what? No thanks. In fact, please leave my adventuring party immediately. Valerie goes on about how beautiful she is and, as another comment said, she looks like she should be a school lunch lady. If we are including DLC, there were probably about 4 or 5 companions that I didn't find to be irritating or boring. None of them were super interesting though. As I said previously, kingdom management can get bothersome later in the game.

My latest party is barely level 3, and my stopping point is only about five to six hours into the game (if you're not playing it like me, a moron). But with a total DAY AND A HALF of play time, I think I have a decent idea of what else to expect and how I feel about this game. And.... I do recommend it? There are many caveats though. This is a game that demands attention, focus, thought and deep wells of patience that, honestly, I don't think I have right now. But if you have the resources to give this game, I think it will be a phenomenal adventure where your plucky band of mercenaries end up dethroning the Stag Lord and ruling over the Stolen Lands.

I'll be honest in that I am a 5e player, through and through. I've wanted to try Pathfinder for quite a while - especially 2nd Edition - but I've never had the opportunity with a dedicated group.  I find the familiarity in Pathfinder though; I forge a mercenary with their own background, class, magic and ideals. I see a game system reliant on d20 rolls and modifiers, proficiencies and skills and alignments and everything else in a character-driven role-playing hyphen-overloaded game. With what little I've read of the system and its quirks, I think Kingmaker does a great job at translating Pathfinder into a video game. A challenging, punishing, annoyingly complex video game. 

This is an intricate, rude game. Whether that's in a good or bad way depends on your temperament. I've restarted at least five times with different party loadouts, focusing on different quests, and I still am left to die horribly at the hands of a clutch of giant spiders and their matriarch while my party cannot escape a web trap to save their souls. Seriously, I tried for ten real minutes just to escape a web trap, with one of my characters succeeding and the other four being stuck. The only way I could escape it was to use camping supplies to wait an in-game hour for the web to disappear.

I missed eight attacks in a row during my second combat - some spells, some crossbows, some blades - while my enemies land every strike, some critically. After losing a skill check to cross a downed tree over a chasm I SWEAR is no deeper than five feet, all of my party members lose half their health. While playing on easy, I am destroyed by a wandering band of slavers along the directed path of one of the first quests of the game, killing my party four times before I am enough of a threat the FIFTH time, they just steal one of my companions to sell them at a camp filled with MORE of their slaver buddies (it takes me three restarts to free that companion, by the by, who is less than thankful why did I even lift a finger JAETHAL??).

Kingmaker is unafraid to rip off your arm if a bear rolls a nat20 on their attack. It will happily place multiple traps within a kobold's lair that have very high perception checks to rely on, one after another. It will not expect you to survive, or offer an olive branch while mites and giant centipedes are ripping out your liver. 

I am certain somebody enjoys that kind of challenge, but as somebody who adores every SoulsBorne game I've ever played, it feels a bit cheap. There is so much to see and do while traveling and exploring locations, but it boils down to who's gonna try - and likely succeed - to kill you today? There are certainly other ways to get through an encounter, don't get me wrong. But if it was a skill check to survive an encounter, 'normal' difficulty gives you -1, 'easy' is a flat d20 roll, and 'hard' puts you at disadvantage with a -5 to make the kick to the crotch bleed more. 

I'm probably salty. In fact, I know I'm salty. I really want to love this game because I know that a TON of work has gone into this. I've made and played in lots of tabletop campaigns, and when such a beloved system is translated to a video game so successfully, I want to give it praise. It deserves praise! But it feels like I'd want to play this in-person far more than I want to play this here, despite containing plenty of complex combat encounters and kingdom management that I will likely never see in their intended form. 

I don't want to have this only about Kingmaker's difficulty, because I enjoy so many other portions of it. While I think one of the primary characters - Linzi - has voice direction that doesn't quite mesh well with the other characters, almost every character I've met and heard about has been lovely and intriguing. A half-orc and his betrothed elf, inducted into slavery and eventually freed, who absolutely love how much they hate each other; a borderlands merchant fighting for his home against the Stag Lord's bandits, flinging alchemist's fire and standing tall against murderous marauders; the pleading dryad with no better option against the Stolen Land's corrupting fog than to enlist your aid. These are characters I WANT to see more of. Hell, some are characters I recognize from scant glances at the Pathfinder handbook for Shelyn's sake. 

As things are right now though, I won't be seeing more of them. I may play this game one day on the absolute easiest difficulty and see if my opinion changes, but I don't think I should have to tweak everything to its least challenging form - an ""only in it for the story"" mode without a crafted battle/skill experience that RPG's are wonderful for - just to get through the game without feeling useless and annoyed.",1677988586,1677988586,False,14,0,0.574036300182342529,0,True,False,False

The gameplay between the two games is very similar - wrath is harder but more forgiving, most hard parts can be dealt with through creativity or lowering difficulty. 
kingmaker is a different boat - it's ""easier"" (i wouldn't say either is very easy for a newcomer), but mistakes cannot usually be easily fixed - especially in the larger advisor decisions. If you fail there, game over! (you can continue by turning on auto manage, just without the fun dilemmas and flavor they provide)
As a note for starters - I'll say this for either game - try normal and then switch to easy if you hit a brick wall. I did this initially and I very much recommend it. Normal is waaay more doable after you understand the mechanics (doesn't mean easy ride, though - if you are a min/max person, it's probably smoother, but I have never been one and the challenge imo is pretty fun. I definitely swap between easy and normal most of the time though)

That said, this game is a sprawling, epic journey. The story spans an immense amount of quests and things to explore. My first two campaigns were each about 70 hrs and I failed and lost both. You build an empire from nothing, and it's very rewarding in that sense. There are good parts to the length, and bad - obviously that's a lot of time to be playing a game without having reached a conclusion to the story! But! The story, just like in Wrath, will pull you in if you let it, and then you'll be sitting on multiple breakthroughs wondering where the time went.

The rougelike DLC (beneath the stolen lands) is easily another ten to seventy hours or more, and I highly recommend it if you like the main game.

I'm a long time pathfinder player, and I've heard good things, but this game suffers from some pretty critical issues that repeatedly strip my enjoyment out of the game. First, its still buggy years after release and I've had multiple issues where the game just broke. The second is that a ton of mechanics are done behind hidden rolls. So there's just like perception checks you can quietly fail that prevent you from getting the ""true"" ending in some quests, or from being able to reforge artifacts. Finally there's pretty significant elements that are super unpolished.  

Kingdom building especially feels like a tacked on element which is really frustrating in a game about running a kingdom. The only player customization elements are placing buildings in settlements, which arent reflected when you visit and also can't be rotated? so theres just buildings and layouts you can't use because very basic shit never made it in the game. The DC's for the advisor checks also get ridiculous, for most of the last two books 2/3 of my advisors have been completely unable to make their checks, which sends you into a stability tailspin which makes everything worse.

The merchants in your capital never get new inventory, despite in game years passing (get fucked if you want to make more camp food)

In addition the difficulty scaling bites, when you crank it up it just again quietly gives everything a bunch of immunities. Like pathfinder already has a template and cr system for scaling encounters easier, why make an already good system bad.

The game also doesn't 'really pay attention to the parts of your run that are actually important. I kept tristian with me for my entire run, do all of the fucker's quests, load him up with the sickest gear. and then because i also did jaethal's quests on the side she kills him off screen without being able to resurrect him or reclaim his gear (guy literally had over 100k gp in items on him). 

The crushing thing is that this game could be so much fun but it just rolls proverbial nat 1's constantly when it comes down to it.

Long and short, 

I really like what this game could be. I really like the premise. But I think they went a little too ""Dark Souls"" (expert mode orentation) with it. 

If you don't know anything about Pathfinder, and don't enjoy arduous learning curves, you'll likely hate this game. If you don't mind difficult learning curves, but know nothing of Pathfinder, like me, you'll find love and frustration in equal measure. It's like you're expected to Google everything and read walkthroughs instead of just playing and enjoying the game.... Dunno about you, but I prefer to try on my own before looking for a guide through a game....

I truely want to like this game, but the fact that the simple mechanics make it impossible to handle in less than 5 tries is just inexcusable. 

Kingdom management is still broken.. You're REQUIRED to make certain choices, or be doomed to eventual failure. If you don't get the gnome, you're just automatically economically disadvantaged. Not very D&D of you, Devs....

There are still pretty massive ""WTF"" moments in the game. Such as the showdown with Irrovetti. After defeating him, if you have any summoned creatures, they will be instantly unsummoned, and you will be summarily attacked by an incredibly OP creature, that can, almost at will, cast Heal (+150hp to itself), which HAS to be either a bug, or scripted such as Amiri's defeat at the barbarian camp. Totally going to wreck your experience with it if you have a summoner to help level the difficulty.

At the end of it all. I can't recommend. This game is still way too experimental for anyone who hasn't already paid, or isn't a ""I like having to die 50 times before I can get a random win"".

Aside from that. Kingdom management is abismal at best. Just set it to ""Effortless"" or ""auto"" (If you set it to auto, you cannot revert, which in turn robs you of some of the fun) if you care to adventure. If you just want to run the kingdom, you'll get jacked up later ( you won't likely have the epereince to deal with the threat ), and have your own frustrations.

Great concept... Terrible execution by the devs not thinking before they make changes.

Time to put this game back down for another 6 months and decide if I want to even bother again.....

Edit:
Downloaded this to try it again. Seems Varnhold's Lot is just a terrible rehash of the original story line, and even worse, they continued with the garbage tactic of nerfing player rolls, buffing AI rolls, and still placing tons of high level enemies. Also, ranged chars are useless. They're going to miss because the DLC doesn't offer ranged equipment on par with what is needed. Funny that one of the story chars is a ranger that's only good at archery... basically, it's :poop:.... No wonder they're closing the doors. Absolute garbage. Paizo and Silver should be fuggin ashamed of this thing....

Edit :

Original story, check. Good graphics, Check. Fun. Nope. 

Kingdom management has gotten a little better, after I spent about 300 hours getting to understand it through 4 failed play troughs.... Mobs are still terrible. Either unimaginative and unchallenging rabble, or a horde of stat damage dealers that will kill your characters with 4-6 hits, even at level 10. And the stat damage dealers are EVERYWHERE in this game. The devs took roughly 15-20 percent of the creature catalog, and just went with the most dangerous ones that they could find, and that's what they put in the game, FRICKIN. EVERYWHERE. It's so lazy. No real design went into this. They didn't even bother adding in some tough but fair enemies. They just went with the ones that can deal stat damage, so they can kill your character in a few hits if they don't make the proper save throw. And even then, they were caught with issues regarding ""dice"" rolls. This game and anyone involved with it should be ashamed of themselves. 

Yeah. Having an experience designed for top tier players is really gonna bring in a new player base.... fugg outta here you dumb-ass. You're doing a disservice to the table top genre in general. And you wonder why your industry is dying........ You're an Ancient Soul Sealer that just hit you 3 times with a crit to yourself... -12 to 15 wisdom... one shot...",1542862196,1677471494,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, there is a lot to like. Graphics, sound, and the like are very good, and I find the game pleasing in both visuals and sounds. I have no complaints in that department. Game play is very much like 3rd edition D&D... This is also what Pathfinder 1e was meant to be like, and I assume the game play is therefore also very much like PF1e, although I have not played that game myself, so I can't say for sure. I very much feel like I am playing older school D&D with this game, and I am enjoying that aspect.

The controls/UI for this game are a mixed bag. Mostly they are fine, but there is definitely an awkwardness about certain things. I find spellcasting mostly fine but occasionally frustrating -- when a spellcaster is holding a melee weapon and you click the shortcut for a RANGED spell and target an enemy (with the spell icon clearly showing in your mouse pointer), there seems to be almost a 50-50 chance that the caster will instead just walk up to the enemy and stab, instead of doing the RANGED cast that you told it to do. I've had to reload a couple of times due to this (when a vulnerable caster walked right into a sea of trolls or something, contrary to what I told the computer to do). This doesn't happen all the time, but it's enough to be frustrating.

I also find the UI and controls for kingdom management rough and non-intuitive. I normally like the whole 'bulid the fortress' type of play, and never got to do that in a PnP D&D game, so I was looking forward to it. Parts of it are OK (the build menu is fine, for instance), but other parts are rough around the edges and I have found this part more frustrating than enjoyable.

I have mixed feelings about the open world aspect of the game. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but they have paired the open world with countdown timers (aka ""tension clocks"") and I feel this works at cross-purposes to the open world. I would like to go down this road and explore those ruins over there, but I only have 30 days left of my quest and I can't spare the time. I'd rather be able to just relax and explore what I want when I want.

Once you get into an explore-able area, that part of the game is quite nice. I find the combat, in turn-based mode, to be extremely satisfying, because there is a lot of tactical interest to most combat encounters, and I like being able to maneuver my tanky melee characters in place to protect the squishies and what not. Deciding when to use the big gun spells, when to hold them in reserve, which enemy to focus fire on, all of that is relevant and important in most encounters, and I do enjoy that. I also like that the game doesn't protect you from going where you don't belong.

On the other hand, I found some of the irrelevant encounters, both wandering and set, to be rather repetitive. I have fought packs of wolves too many times to count, and although they were a challenge at 3rd or 4th level, by 6th they are just trivial and at some point you'd think the game would just not bother. 

In the end, I have found there to be a lot of good mixed with some not-so-good and a little bit of very-not-good... but overall this is a worthwhile game to play, and the pros far outweigh the negatives.",1676824809,1676824984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I ranted about it in the steam communities threads and people laughed at me and told me ""git gud noob"" which infuriated me further.

Despite that, I persisted with the game and boy am I glad I did. After that early learning curve, the game is an absolute gold mine -if you like crpgs-. I didnt even mind the kingdom management side game, hell I'll even say I liked it. Sure it was difficult and I needed to read a lot of guides etc but it felt very satisfying.

In the end, the game IS very difficult, especially if you are new to it. Hell, it's difficult even if you are experienced to it and there's a difficult setting that even the best of the best would struggle with. That's kind of the point in the game and once you understand the mechanics, the difficulty is part of the fun.

Now about the story/characters writing: Oh man, I really loved that part. I wont say it was perfect, but it was definitely very charming and drew me in. Some of the characters I really loved and oh man, the VOICE ACTING! Superb work truly on the voice acting!

Re-load and try again.

But this Viscount Smoulderburn encounter shows up really early on and once you've triggered it, it just comes out of nowhere. Its AC is 33 or something so you can only hit it with crits, but it also spams fear AOEs so all your guys are too busy running to even attack. You are basically required to save frequently, before doing anything, just in case you accidentally trigger some bullshit nonsense like this that you can't run from and can only get through with hours and hours of reloading until you get extremely lucky. What garbage game design.

It's also full of bugs and unless you know the pathfinder system already, you're never going to figure out what is even happening in combats. The game has an ""encyclopedia"" with some common terms, but there are loads of stats and numbers and terms thrown at you that you can only find out by googling, and pathfinder's such a crunchy confusing system that even that won't always help you.

Finally, it also suffers pretty heavily from the ol' RPG video game trope of ""you can't do that one thing because it would break the story, do one of these options instead"".

Endscreen at least should be much more detailed. Character UI is convoluted and very unintuitive, NWN this better 20 years ago. Kingdom management takes this to another level.

However, it is fun, it is long, it is epic, and it's the closest you can get to DnD 3rd edition these days.",1676585949,1676585949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No where near finished, but already have a bunch of time in it.  I was nervous because of the negative comments about unbalnced encounters, but having played it, I think those comments are overstating the case.

Yes, some key encounters are tough, and well, they should be.  Reloading from a save after things go wrong is pretty normal, so I fully understand why Owlcat went the route they did.  The key encounters are like puzzles, you might have to give them a few tries until you get them right, and that doesn't bother me.

There are also some encounters that are completely vicious for the area they are in, but - and this is the important thing - they are avoidable.  For example, in one area there is a well with a lid nailed on it, if you pry up the lid two monsters come out and attack you, at the probable level you will hit that area (7 or 8) you might be able to handle one, but two?  Not likely.  I went, 'okay then' and reloaded.

As the game tips say, when in doubt, save.

Another encounter was when I entered a cave, and saw something VERY large.  I went into the cave cautiously (as is sensible) and so didn't run straight into it and immediately end up in combat.  I used the inspect tool and it helpfully informed me that it had more hit points than my entire party combined, would ignore the first 10 points of damage of pretty much any attack I did (I had a lone dagger that could hurt it), and had regeneration 10 on top of that.  Alrighty then!  No, no, don't get up, we were just leaving.  Bye!

To me it makes sense that everything in an area isn't going to be the same level, some things are going to be more powerful, and you should avoid them and maybe come back to them later.


Now, some don't like that, which is fine, but if you don't have a problem with some encounters maybe taking a few tries, and others being something you can't do when you first find them, then you should be okay.  Just don't leap into the harder difficulty settings until you are comfortable with it (you have a lot of control over the exact difficulty you want to have so can ease them up, I started at Normal and then started pushing up the individual difficulty settings as I got more comfortable).

I also recommend turn based mode, at least for the more difficult encounters.  Either that or have it pause at the end of of every character's action so you can give them new orders.  Or pause at the end of the turn so that you can give new orders to your entire party (it's not *actually* real-time anyway if the game is still divided up into discrete turns).

With that out of the way, I will say that the game plays well for those familiar with this type of game, the voice acting is pretty good - although not all dialog is voiced, a reasonable chunk is - and overall its a pretty solid game.  I did get annoyed at the fixed camera, but you can get a mod to let you move it around and it works pretty well with only the odd graphic glitch as the game was meant for only one angle.

Excellent written story with great world building. I enjoyed just about every companion and quest. I highly recommend this game for lovers of CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Pillar's of Eternity. 

That recommendation does come with some caveats though... 

The game can be very unclear about what needs to be done at times. I had to look at guides at several points, and would recommend doing so whenever you get stuck longer than your comfort level allows, to keep frustration from reaching fun ruining levels. 

Additionally, difficulty can spike unexpectedly, so unless you want some punishment be ready to turn down the difficulty, especially for some of the end game areas. Personally, I'd start at easy and maybe notch it up level by level as you get used to things, then drop it back down when you hit a wall.

Finally put the Kingdom builder into very easy mode, but not auto unless you really dislike it. I really enjoyed the flavor of kingdom building, but at even normal difficulty you can end up in death spirals as your kingdom falls apart.

I will remark that I went into this game with the idea of all the negative/mixed reviews in mind. 

The game doesn't present its story in any groundbreaking way and if you're expecting crazy cinematics or fully voiced characters everywhere you will be dissappointed. As for dialogue trees as well there isn't too much creativity here as it feels by the numbers with your ""alignment"" being the odd choice from just exposition choices (read: almost no point giving me multiple options instead of just letting them spew out lore)
    It may seem that I'm only talking negatives but thats for its story-telling and presentation in that regard. I recently played Disco Elysium and to me will become the gold standard for narrative, choice driven role playing in CRPGs for me but the appeal of this game is more the critically maligned combat.

  Save before every encounter. Save scumming is kind of the norm I've been playing with. You may run into an encounter that will easily wipe you out. Then it becomes a small puzzle to figure out. Not really challenging but like having to buff everyone or approach the encounter in a different way or even having to haul your party all the way back to HQ to reassemble and re-equip. Battles seem to happen faster than most CRPGs I have been playing, as in enemies and characters seem to die really fast.

New to the pathfinder mechanics it is fun to play with builds and multi-classing and theory classing characters then getting into battles and seeing the results. I figure this is more the appeal of the game than a deep narrative role-playing experience.

Exploring the world map is challenging and interesting for people willing to invest some imagination. The game has a bunch of small bugs related to the execution of commands in turn-based mode. Sometimes the characters don't execute their commands and other times they only execute half of the command like when a monk uses a stunning fist and decides not to flurry. They are detrimental enough errors that they lead to lost fights. Alone a few glitches are not a deal breaker. The deal breaker for me was the spider swarm encounter available for the starting low-level party. The spider swarm in the pen & paper game is immune to weapon attacks, and this game carries that mechanic faithfully. But that is not at all balanced for a low-level party with very little access to splash damage. Options include 20-30 gold alchemical fire/acid vials or spells, that the party may not have access to. Should the party run out of these resources then the spider swarms are pretty much invincible. The only melee option that can be used is a torch that deals 1 damage max per round meaning that it would take around 10 rounds to kill one swarm. And those torches are optional to carry around. The game throws multiple swarms at your party as a surprise. And that would be rock'n'roll except that there is no intuitive way to flee combat if things go sideways. Map travel is locked during combat which makes fleeing all but impossible. Buyer beware for those who shy away from punishment. This game is best played with multiple saves because bugs and poor game balance can ruin the fun. Worth checking out for anyone passionate about the genre.

If you have never played Pathfinder (or any Table Top Role Playing Game for that matter) then I think you will struggle with this game. It is a pretty complex ruleset, and you need to play slowly and carefully to understand how the dice rolls affect combat. Having said that, once you start to understand it is quite fantastic.

The game has well balanced enemies and scales encounters well. You can't just rest between fights. Even at medium difficulty You need to save your resources. You will breeze through low level monsters, and then all of a sudden get absolutely crushed. Because of this you need to save often. These hard fights are the most satisfying though. You need to inspect the monsters to identify their weaknesses and buff your party and target enemies accordingly. Its in these fights that you use your scrolls, potions and high level spells, which stops you from hoarding all your items like in other games. It is really satisfying when you pull it off. When it is too tough, you can scale the difficulty down a level which is usually enough to breeze through the fight.

It also took me 35 hours (across 2 restarts) to get to the actual Kingdom Management part. This is its own separate game, and is very satisfying so far. Your decisions are important and make a difference. I have been looking for a kingdom management thing like this since Neverwinter Knights 2 (noting that system was fairly simplistic). You can automate the Kingdom Management part if you like.

The lore of the world is very rich and it is making for a decent story. It hints at a much bigger world. The characters are excellently done and varied.

There's certainly a lot of good ideas here, but even leaving aside the bugs the encounter design is uniformly bad and the writing is forgettable. The game's two halves - the traditional CRPG and the kingdom management are fundamentally at odds; the CRPG restricts your ability to play the management game and vice versa.

The dev team are clearly talented, and they could likely have made something of this with another year, and Deep Silver have very clearly dropped the ball by not giving them that time. I would like to take this opportunity to call out the people yelling at the dev team for the state this released in, even though there's a major publisher attached to this and the decision to release the game is so clearly not on the designers and programmers.

If you're a big fan of RPGs and you're looking for something new you'll probably have a good time with it. If you're anything less than a dedicated fan of the genre then it's impossible to recommend this over the Shadowrun games by Harebrained Schemes, either Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin or Dragon Age: Origins. If you're very specifically looking for something that combines a CRPG with a strategy layer, then you're far better off tracking down Neverwinter Nights 2 than playing this - whilst the NWN2 OC is not in itself a great RPG it is a far better realisation of these concepts than Pathfinder: Kingmaker.

UPDATE: So I played this again, after really, really liking the follow-up, Wrath of the Righteous. It seemed like the right time to give Kingmaker another shot, especially post patches and patches of bugfixes. And my take is honestly that's its a profoundly mediocre game.

Don't go this route before the list, because this is for when these games don't cut it.
Not for everyone.

I don't want a kingdom to manage, I honestly don't know what I should  prioritize and couldn't care less. I'm in it for the story campaign and combat.

Which takes me to the combat. They added 2 modes of combat, real-time with pausing (Like baldurs gate), and turn based (like divinity original sin). The latter is obviously not the intention of the how the game should be played by the developers. Making it clunky and unfair at times. And the realtime duration between taking action is way too long at times, I could get beat up by a normal monster with 5 hits before my character finally takes that 1 action I gave them an hour ago.

Pros:
As a new player to anything pathfinder this is an enjoyable game that helps you learn the basics of pathfinder 1e rules. The soundtrack is wonderful and the classes are diverse and fairly fun, each feeling unique and different. The story telling and lore is very detailed as well and seems to change dependant on your choices. 

If your looking to get a more practical feel for how pathfinder plays, this would be a good start!

Cons:
- Character customisation lacking (Not in terms of classes but in terms of apperance.) 
- Not open world. Map is divided into grid layout which does ruin the immersion a little bit for me sadly. I can't claim it feels like I am playing an actual TTRPG but in these Isometric-type games that can be very hard to achieve. 
- Only a small amount of content reflected. From what I have seen of Pathfinder it is far more expansive. That's okay, but it does mean you don't quite get the full experience of all it has to offer.",1675173076,1675173076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only problem with the title so far is how it handles alignments. Having your alignment switch based on your dialog choices rather than actions feels like the developer is trying to push their moral views on the player.

I am an RPG veteran but had no experience with the Pathfinder Tabletop system and I can so far say the game is amazing. It did require to read up on the rules and consult the wiki's and guides for the initial character build, but after that the game opens up and the sheer amount of build options and ways to approach a fight is stunning. 

For me the implementation of 'Turn-Based Mode' made me buy the game, but I also started to love the 'Real-time with Pause' option for Trash mobs, and there are a lot of them.....
These two modes can be switched on the go, even during an ongoing fight. Also the difficulty can be adjusted any time in the settings. 

After 40+h I barely made it into Act II and feel like I just scratched the surface. I still have to consult the wiki regularly. But the complexity really pulls me in, every time my party gains a level the new feats, talents and spells open up so many new options and makes it super exiting to try out new strategies. 

I do strongly suggest to start on 'challenging' difficulty and decide later in the game to go up/down depending on your preference.

You create a character from one of 16 classes, each with 3 subclasses, with a goal of creating a character that can withstand what the game throws at you. There are also 7 prestige classes (which require a mixture of abilities, feats, skills and spellcasting prowess to qualify for) that open you up to the realisation that many of them do the same thing.

Reasons I can't recommend the game:
1) Armor Class.
You can slip on a nice suit of chainmail to begin and put on a shield and think 'hey, these enemies with their +3 attack bonuses will only hit me 75% of the time' but for some reason, while level 2, you will face a creature with +14 to hit... and has multiple attacks dealing 50-80% of your health per hit... with extra mobs.
I am level 7 atm and have 2 characters with AC 32 (boosted to 40 with spells/buffs) and yet... I've faced enemies ranging from +7 to hit at my level, all the way up to +23. The disparity is crazy in a system designed to roll a d20 to determine hit. If I hadn't got a background of DnD for 20 years, I'd be going crazy wondering how to achieve characters who survive.

2) Challenge of fights.
By the time you hit level 5 with your characters, every fight will be pointless or deadly - there is simply no in between. Knowing which fights to avoid is impossible without save scumming, which is not exactly fun in a world you'd like to roleplay in. Flipping the wrong lid or resting in the wrong place at level 4 sees you fighting monsters designed for 13th level characters to face.... not that fun. (doable, but again save scum for the perfect results).

3) Lack of Direction.
You're given time limits to achieve goals, but no real direction in game. The story is supposed to drive a game, but here it feels more like a roadblock, there to stop you enjoying doing what you want to do. After a while you then become ruler of the area, adding a layer of cluelessness to your already clueless ideal. 

4) Magic Items.
There are a whole heap of +1 items here, +2 there and that is quite fun... but then if you don't get the weapons you need, you're screwed with horrible choices. Weapon Focus (a feat the game constantly recommends) adds +1 to hit with a specific weapon, meaning it's often worthless as you can't find the weapon you wish to use, or you move acts and have to upgrade it.

Overall, I think Kingmaker was created by people who aren't very emotionally aware of what makes games fun - they've tried to throw a little of everything into the same game, creating a Bardic moment (Jack of all trades, Master of none) which has meant this game is incredibly mediocre.

Should you buy it? It's your money, but don't expect to enjoy this more than many MANY other RPG offerings that may or may not be on sale in Steam.",1675002768,1675002768,False,5,1,0.519107699394226074,0,True,False,False

This both of these games use the first edition rules of Pathfinder, which is much closer to D&D 3.5. Which, both systems, I apparently despise. Do not play on turnbase mode if you value your time.

Pathfinder second edition feels like a completely different game and all the mechanics run so much smoother and have a lot more meaning to them. I really, really hope that any future Pathfinder games use the newer rules and I will salivating be all over them.

I think the devs did a great job working with the rule system they had, I just don't want others to make the same false assumptions my friends and I did.

Kingmaker's strong side are clearly the characters and the writing, which are plain and simply very good. Sadly, the game seems weirdly insistent on not focusing on it's good parts. Instead it smothers you with a half-baked and unnecessary kingdom management mechanic and uninspired and copy-pasted combat-encounters.

That is also the reason I give this game a bad review. It just does not respect your time. Every quest has (at least) twice as many combat encounters as necessary, to the point of tediousness.

There is a lot to like, from the turn-based combat system to the pretty graphics. Even the kingdom management interface is neat, but the truth is that it's just too slow, and too little guidance. A LOT of the game is spent just watching your people walk from one side of the map to the other, or searching aimlessly for the next hook in the quest. Making it feel like a real slog. The game is not difficulty-scaled, which I usually like, but then there is also no indication of how difficult an area might be, and also no way to retreat when something turns out to be too tough, so the only option is to constantly reload the game when you find a monster who is too strong. And of course. It also means that you can never know, when you fail, if it was because you weren't strong enough, or because you didn't do it right.

It uses core Pathfider rules, which is awesome, but those rules are designed to be used at the table with a DM, and a single-player game just doesn't work quite so well under the same ruleset. These rules are stark and harsh, and require a human touch in-between the rulebook and the players to work optimally.

Finally, as cool as the kingdom management stuff is, it's very poorly balanced. All of the challenges you come upon are literally just a dice roll pass/fail, and as the story progresses, the events get so 'difficult' that you have 10-30% pass rate, and then the kingdom starts to fail because you are failing too many challenges, and that just doesn't make sense. It also starts crippled (you don't have access to anyone who can take on the economic advisor, for example, and the game does not give you any hints as to where you can find one, so you will just always fail any economic quests until you luck upon a economic advisor. (I only found one after installing the DLC. I never did figure out where people with only the base game installed are supposed to find one.)

Overall, it's a game with a lot of cool ideas, but they are just not put together nicely enough. The engine is sweet, and a lot could have been done with it, and I hope more is done with it, but this game is a sloggy mess.",1674578964,1674578964,False,8,1,0.585625946521759033,0,True,False,False

On it's base it has a cool premise and gives you enough leeway to go shuffling around here and there and do quests. Sadly, though, this game sometimes give like indication of what to do and the loadings can be a pain sometimes, so SSD is probably recommended.
The thing that broke this game for me though is the fact that the game does not allow you to manage your kingdom in peace.
It forces you to follow the main questline after a number of days and if you don't you get a game over that is unavoidable.
I like the kingdom creation part, more than i like the base game, so being forced to play the main quests seemed like a chore that took away the fun of the game. If you like kingdom management, though, it's better to go after one, because this is not it.

Graphics are fine and gameplay is aswell, nothing special here. What shines in this game is the dialogues and the lore, which is *also* why i liked kingdom management, because it was where it had the most of theses.
The dialogue usually changes the order you do things or how you do then, but this game will still usually force you down a certain way.
A minor spoiler is that regardless if you have high intimidation, are high leveled and know how to deal with trolls in the second mainquest, trying to intimidate their leader always fumbles (Atleast for me). Replaying the game revels theses situations way more than you might think so and the only decisions that really affected me the most is the ones to choose who stays in your part or not. Otherwise, the dialogue is still fun and very well written and stands alone by itself.

Balance is terrible (everyone has like 10% chance of dealing damage early game and you just wait and watch them miss and miss and miss)

UI is terrible, unintuitive, clustered and you actually have to look for things to click on since there is sth randomly flashing all the time.

Dialogues early were interesting with all the choices, but it soon disapeared behind the messy combat, random bugs (some of which are recomended by comunity to make the game suck less) and neccessity to install half a dozen of mods to actually make the game suck less...

From turn based RPGs so far the worst game i have played.

Update after few more attempts. UI still crap even after i know the mechanics (thanks to WotR which is amazing outside of bugged morale system and TTRPG), quests in act 1 are really shallow, but worst thing is the timer for those quests. Because completing them isnt enough, you actually have to report completition, which can be several days away from location of the quest, and even if you finish and you are literally a minute from quest giver, game will kick you out because you failed the quest (which you actually did, but you didnt talk to all the people around the world in time because you have to check on them 1 by 1 and they are all short sighted). Most of design flaws are just people learning how to make a game/ui/story (and they did a good job improving it in WotR), but that stupidly designed timer (there are actually multiple, some hidden and they all kick you form the game telling you to reload save you dont even have) are just a fuck you from the devs. Since there are several options how to lock your games, forcing you to restart completely, i definitely dont recomend playing it. Buy WotR and avoid this plague... 


Edit: Another update. Game is still worth shit. It is actually getting worse. Random events swarming one advisor while rest has absolutely nothing to do failing and destroying your country. Random events popping up and failing while you are locked in rank ups or expansions, destroying your country. DCs of events skyrocketing all of a sudden so all advisor are constantly failing, even with items for needed stats and being leveled up. Kingdom builder of Kingmaker is a bugged, terribly developed mess. And fans are still defending it and saying how you should scumsave every single day and download several mods for every damn aspect of the game to make it at least playable, claiming thats a good thing. This game is absolute garbage.

1) Normal difficulty is actually DIFFICULT.
2) Use the manage  button when resting, and consume your rations. It will make your kingdom management so much easier. 
3) Rest in dungeons. Consume rations (experiment with manage options to make the best out of resting).
4) Open the Spellbook of clerics. Do it. Pick their spells and add them to the toolbar. (Press B). Harrim and Tristian will be 100x more usefull after this.
5) Prioritize PROBLEMS over OPPORTUNITIES. Seriously.
6) Use rations when outside your Barony/Kingdom. Don't hunt if you can avoid it. Money is NOT a problem.
7) Try to optimize your travel routes. It all adds up pretty FAST and pretty heavy.
8) Without spoiling, your kingdom needs to resolve MAIN-QUEST related events and milestones ASAP. Seriously, don't let your kingdom suffer too much in stats. Finish your main quest as soon as you can while keeping up with side-quests/exploration, because kingdom stats = success chance in resolving problems.
9) Did I mention you should use rations?
10) It's deceptively important to optimize travel and rest time. PLEASE keep your party traveling light! Don't loot everything. USE your personal stash to keep important items and souvenirs.
11) NEVER let your BP fall bellow 0. It will kill your kingdom after 2 weeks. BUY BP with Gold in the kingdom management interface (just do it). Try to always have at least 100 BP.

12) Game has memory leak problems. When fights slow down, it's time to SAVE / Quit game and Reload save.

TL/DR: Manage your inventory, resolve main quests ASAP (they're the source of a lot of PROBLEMS and stat PENALTIES), buy BP with gold, keep your clerics spellbook (B) filled with spells (every level).",1672065711,1674305502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far, the game seems great for a fan of Pathfinder 1e or D&D 3.5e, though there are a lot of differences from pen-and-paper. It is very complex and doesn't pull its punches, so the standard CRPG practices apply: hard save often and follow a guide for your first playthrough, at least to help you build your characters properly. If you don't follow a walkthrough, you may occasionally feel the need to sacrifice progress to load a past save, as bad choices can have devastating consequences that aren't immediately apparent.

The most unique thing about this incarnation of the CRPG formula is that time actually matters. The world will not wait for you, so you have to pay attention to the game's hints and identify urgent quests to do first, or people will die. You have to be efficient with your rests and your traveling, or you won't have time to tend to your kingdom and meet quest timers. Some people will dislike the challenge this presents, but I wish other CRPGs were more like this. It does mean that you can suffer terrible consequences because you did things in the wrong order or wasted too much time, hence my warning about losing progress.

Overall, this is perhaps the only CRPG to rival BG 1 & 2 in complexity and extensiveness. But just like in BG, if you don't know the right way to do things, you may struggle. A lot.",1668363147,1674226906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The scripted events fail to consider whether they work, yet an obvious intended result is scripted in. Example. A quest assumed you to bullshit your way through bunch of barbarians. Treat everyone as if they had true sight. A quest where a soul devourer is summoned to fight one-on-one fights against certain team members. Gets healed by your cure spells. So on and so forth. Literally ZERO play-test is done on these quests. It's okay if you make a Final Fantasy game requiring everyone beats the stage using the same trick, but this is not how D&D is supposed to be.
2. Similarly, due to companion quests, forget about all those fancy builds you see online. Build everyone a one-man/woman-army. Tanks will lose in duels. Supports will lose in duels. Rangers will lose in duels. Spellcasters, sorry, your imp. Invisibility works on one hit and one hit only.
3. Because of horrible difficulty control, you are going to do a ton of savespamming. You can try a trainer, but it only works to an extent, because certain quests can also BE if you do them in wrong order. This brings us to:
4. The toxic philosophy of punishing players if they are naughty. It's a toxic tradition with D&D but particular bad with this one. Come on, you are not training the next Palpatine or Darth Vader. Your gamers are common people who just want entertainment. So what if they just want to win? If they want to be taught lessons in strategy, they'd go play a strategy game.

Half of the encounters you will fight in this game - including some of the plot-critical ones - are dysfunctionally hard, resulting in a multitude of party wipes  due to your characters being physically incapable of hitting the enemies they're fighting. Enemy armour class, strength and attack is massively bloated compared to the actual core rules, whilst player attacks and abilities are not. The result is a series of painfully frustrating encounters where you find yourself logging off, frustrated by the sheer ineptitude of a dev team who decided to make an encounter for a poorly optimised level 3 party which featured a treant with an AC of 26.

I'm a huge fan of Baldur's Gate and the other IE games, loved the CRPG resurgance lately with Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, Divinity, Shadowruns and Tyranny but this game is the top. 

Beautiful artwork, fantastic OST, deep combat systems, highly adjustable difficulty (had to turn it down 3 times throughout) tons of stuff to do, fantastic characters with a fascinating setting along with a narrative that starts of feeling shallow and gets deeper as it goes. 

My main complaints are massive bugs on PS5 which I would hope are fixed on PC and the difficulty does have a habit of spiking suddenly, a few times I thought I was going to completely fail the game but an old save saved me. At the start of every chapter absolutely create a manual sort of recovery save just in case and I would create manual saves at the start of dungeons too. I also think when I replay it I will be disabling some of the kingdom management, as much as I think it's a great stress inducer and encouragement stick I'm sure a lot of my 400 hour playtime went in to stressing about this. I don't have a city builder mindset and I don't think I woukd have it in myme to do it again. Some of the later dungeons, especially in the last stretch are fairly annoying, full of enemies that do srat damage that is hard to avoid and theres no protection, resorting to curing the entire party after every little battle which got tedious. Bring lots and lots of scrolls of Restoration / Greater Restoration and Heal spells. Two of the final bosses were pretty summon heavy, particularly one of them that just summoned tons of annoyingly enemies that you had already fought while repeatedly displelling you. Plus throw in sometimes your spell casters will apmost get through their 3 second case tine and then charge someone in melee causing you to start the spell over again. 

Despite these blemishes it is still heavily outweighed by the positives, which is a large, gorgeous interesting game that is fun to discover all it's nooks while also being a very uniquely adjustable challange. 

Looking forward to a replay on PC and I would highly suggest playing as either a Sorcerer, Druid. Paladin or Monk as none of the recruitable NPC's cover these bases and I was a bit bummed I had picked a class that was covered (Inquisitor).

The downside however, is that the pathfinder rules are terrible and encourage cheese.

Choosing to stay prone however means that your character cannot act at all and grants a bonus to all enemies attacking them.

After I`m finished with this game, I am sure I will jump on the next one with much more gusto and experience.

Some brutal game mechanics that overly challenge the player too early, too soon. Monster swarms, etc - Poor risk/reward balance
Background story is ho-hum - standard fantasy fare. Another milieu that's 1300 AD western Europe with magic and demihumans thrown in for laughs.
The camping quasi-realism mechanic is boring and a chore. It always boggles me why some games and some authors are sticklers for this kind of realism when their world operates in ways that are physically impossible or highly improbable, i.e magic, undead, etc. There's a word for this kind of antic, and it's called ""verisimilitude"" and that antic is a gimmick.
Travelling anywhere therefore is a drudge
The barony management aspect is also boring and a chore
None of the characters are memorable and a couple are borderline aggravating

It's an extremely ambitious title but one I think after spending 28 hours on I'm going to take a break from for now. It still gets a thumbs up but here's what I think:

PROS

* Very fun story with lots of world building
* Great companions with deep back stories
* Lots to do and explore
* Incredible build customization, probably second to none

CONS

* A massive time sink to do literally anything: Travel takes a long time, companions are fatigued, and you have to return to the kingdom constantly to attend to matters of state
* There's no sweet spot for difficulty curve. Some enemies are easy and some are unfair (on normal mode). I ended up playing on Story mode mainly because everything takes so long to do that the game just doesn't respect your free time
* The Kingdom mode alone could have been its own game. Squashed into this game it feels like feature creep to the max

All in all this game has a ton going for it and a ton that makes it a tedious time sink. Consider this above all in your purchase.

This might as well be called Pathfinder: Everything wrong with it, but we also cranked up the encounter difficulty level.

How much you ask? about twice or 3 times what is recommended for a fullly minmaxed 6 member party on your level. You better prepare well, oh by the way, you cannot pick your party, here are these joke builds, they will be your companions, and you are not getting more then 3.

I mean, if the goal was to simulate playing under a sadist GM, they succeeded. Of course, in real pathfinder you have actions like running that gives you a 4 times your movement in a stright line, and a retreat maneuver to get out of dodge. Don`t worry, they made sure those options are not in the game, so you can enjoy the full effect of your immersion being shattered as you have to save scum, because you either win or die in one of the encounters way above your level.

Whats this, you think you can at least have fun with a combat where you do not have to get bogged down in numbers? Silly player, they made absolutely sure that if you want to have the slightest bit of a chance, you have to use the turn based system, where you are given the entire experience of waiting for turns and turns as one half your characters miss every single attack for half an hour, while you are wondering why you did not do your taxes instead. In case your wondering, the other half were running away in terror after a frog let out a croak, and the only reason they stopped is because in their infinite wisdom, they decided to run past every single enemy who still had an attack of opportunity.

* It has a really, and I mean really good story. Like It is one the things that I enjoy and it keeps me playing the game.

     * RTS styled combat

* The rpg elements, spells, weapons, and character attributes come directly from D&D. So if you are familiar with D&D, you will understand allot of this game first glance.

- Graphics
-- Between DOS:2 and BG3
--- Its really feel in the middle, not close to BG3, but also better than DOS:2. The ""sequel"" WotR is closer or similar to BG3.

- Character/Party Building
-- ""Pathfinder"" by itself a tabletop rule set, derived from D&D rule set.
--- If you are familiar with Patherfinder rule set, you are at home.
--- If you are familiar with D&D tabletop or game like in Baldur's Gate, then you will be familiar with the creation process, but not the progression and skill tree as the two are very different now
--- If you are from DOS:2 only, no experience with D&D rule set or similar, then you will feel some pain as the rule set and building process is way more restrictive than DOS:2

- Game Play
-- World Size
--- Big. I feel it is comparable to WoW Azeroth area.
-- Combat
--- You have the choice of turn base and real time. I go mostly turn base on my first play. But it can be very long in mid and late game.
--- Again, it feel very different than DOS:2. No high ground advantage like DOS:2 or BG3. But range attach can go through wall/obstacles 80% of the places, especially out door and early in door area. But as game progress, you will find wall and dungeon landscape ""work as intended"".
-- Quest
--- Number
---- A lot! Developer claims over 300, I didn't count. But they do keep you busy for awhile.
--- Timer
---- Yes, there are readable and hidden timer on many quests and events, just do them as fast as you could and you will be fine. (Good luck on first run!!)

I making a bad review, when I actually want to make a good one.
But now it's been a long time that people are trying to let you know that a vicious bug is removing all basic skills (spells stays) from toolbars at each reset of the game, and it makes the game really painful. Some classes are only using those skills, so, bars are always empty. 
I don't know if it's on PC too, but consoles for sure. I bought the game on both plateforms, but I'm enjoying it on PS5 (but I've read it's the same on Xbox too)

Divinity Original Sin 2 may give you more player freedom and flexibility in combat but the campaign still feels more like a video game with the arenas being large interconnected worlds and resting being unnecessary except for healing. Kingmaker cranks up the immersion and adds overland travel for that sweet sweet crunch, the Kingdom management and the ticking clock of quests actually failing if you put them off for too long really add to that crunch as well. A solid adaptation of the Adventure Path (which is out for PF2e by the way) makes it useful for campaign prep as well. Overall a really solid (if a little bit buggy, nothing breaking though) CRPG. 

Oh also all future CRPGs that include obvious trash mobs need the seem less switching between RTwP and TB combat.

I have to amend this review after getting to the final dungeon there is an unavoidable party member death which I just cant stomach. After almost 200 hours to have my party's main support removed in the final dungeon is utter bullshit and such a baffling design choice it makes the rest of the game sour on hindsight.

1) Play it on story mode
2) Turn *indestructible* mode on for your kingdom management

Why?

1) If you want to play it for the combat - just go play the newest installment, Wrath of the Righteous. It's better in every way.
2) If you want to play it for the kingdom management - don't. The main reason is that kingdom management is not an independent feature. It's heavily scripted based on your current main story progression and it functions more as a tool then a feature you would enjoy.

So go play it for the story, it's fun.

1) Story
The story is enjoyable, interesting and engaging. The last chapter felt a bit hollow, rushed, but even then the game is 100+ hours long, so maybe it would actually benefit from cutting the end completely and resolve the story a bit differently.

2) Storytelling
The kingdom management, while terrible as a standalone feature, is used to push you in the main story and give you the feeling of 'urgency'. In this regard, the kingdom management is great and the storytelling greatly benefits from it. Generally I like how the game presents the story to the player, I never got bored of it until the very end (last chapter).

However, there is one problem, as in most of RPGs - info dumps. Most NPCs just provide too much information or just spit too much personal details. Look at Elden Ring - yes, they picked the other extreme, but it works great for story telling. Less is often more.

3) Kingdom management
As I already mentioned few times, kingdom management is the most frustrating part of the game. At the beginning, the system seems fine, it's even enjoyable, but after few hours you realize that:
a) You actually don't build anything (maximum 1 village per region during the whole game), you just try to resolve ""problems"".
b) It's just a game of numbers. Choices and roleplaying don't matter.
c) It's heavily scripted and your 'serene' kingdom goes to crumbling in few days because the game say so. Not because you did anything wrong - it's just how the game uses this system.
d) Unless you follow a specific path and strategy, your kingdom will probably be destroyed anyway.

4) Metagaming
This game suffers from metagaming a lot. What does that mean? Well, if you know what's going to happen then you prepare for it and the game is actually kind of easy. But for your first playthrough you don't know that and the game heavily punishes you for it. To the point that you will probably see game over screen several times. It's even worse in the way that even if you saved your game it might not be enough, because your progress is already in a state of losing without any way of preventing it.

5) Death spiral and timed quests
Everything in the main story has a timer. It works great for the first chapter where the game introduces this mechanic to you and clearly communicates it. But after that the timers are hidden and are revealed just shortly before the failure. The main problem is that the game doesn't communicate well the supposed solution. It gives you enough information that it's urgent, but you often don't know what to do. And the timer is often very short while the solution may require several weeks of traveling on the map including clearing many dungeons. This is metagaming at its finest. And it may lead to a death spiral - you don't know it yet, but you may be in a state that no matter what, you can't make it in time or your kingdom is just unsaveble. It's frustrating and probably the main reason why most of the people didn't finish the game.

6) Balancing issues
The game is difficult, pathfinder system is extremely convoluted and requires a lot of effort to understand it. Moreover, sometimes the battles are very hard and feel unfair. Long story short - story mode is the best way to play it.

Combat can take forever at times and the roll logic often finds characters missing hits more than hitting (potentially just due to old D&D 3E rules).

I would honestly have played the whole game had I been able to just setup a character sheet and play text based the whole adventure.

There were so many points where I was silently screaming about the stupidity of the nonsense the authors were throwing my way ... I am so sad since I would probably forgive all other issues but this was really the main issue for me. 
Also on higher difficulties it is not much more challenging in regards to skill / planning but basically full on save scumming because regardless of what you do 1 roll decides if you live or wipe, or if you get 3 levels worth of xp or not. There is nothing you can do about it Oh I lost initiative and enemy got 1 action which 1 shots your MC reload, Oh your tank got hit and dies from single attack even though the hit chance should be 5% and he has tons of hp, reload. Specifically I hate what the authors did with random number generator on higher difficulties. On average every round my archer attacks, he gets at least one roll of 1, he has 7 attacks. I am 100% sure how it is skewed, I believe they do something like roll twice and select the worse outcome or similar, but then the 20 is not that rare so I am not sure what they do exactly ... why did they decide this is beyond me. This is not making the game more challenging, this makes you save/load more which is not fun at all.
The game also punishes you if you do not bring balanced party to a level that some parts are impossible to get through, that is especially true for the latest parts of the game. Luckily you can replace the team members, but for me it still sucks since I am trying to somehow build a relationship with my companions and this just destroys it, Let me tell you a party with tank, priest and 4 casters is not viable choice for a specific part of the late game.",1671649587,1671649587,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game plays like a tabletop RPG, right down to game pieces and a plot involving a set of twists and turns revolving around a very sad story at the center of which sits a tortured soul. It's up to the player to bring that soul to redemption, or disregard it in the pursuit of power.

There's nothing leading the player by the nose to the goal and the game encourages playing your own way, the Pathfinder system is very accommodating to any playstyle and there are literally hundreds of different class options. What more could you want? Well, contrary to the above statement there are no hookers or blackjack to be had that I have been able to find but there is plenty of high fantasy adventure, dragon slaying and the like. You could even make a team of Halfling Bards, which might be way more awesome than I'm giving it credit for here given their utility.

I tried this game because I wanted to play D&D but I live in the frozen north and have nobody to play with. This is pretty much the second best thing for me, it plays like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights had a weird but very entertaining baby. Outside of tiny issues involving input the game is super responsive to player commands and it's basically D&D with a bunch of extra options and a fun sense of humor. You can't go wrong with this one, there's many hours of gameplay to be had and plenty of replayability with much story to uncover. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

Addendum: You know, there are some features that I didn't go over in the original review and after some time with them I am confident of two things: Varnhold's Lot was meant to be frustrating for no reason and the roguelike portion of the game in Tenebrous Depths is awesome. My only real issue with the DLC is the main boss encounter requires the player to be specialized in a very specific way, at least to my understanding. I had a hell of a time beating it when other monsters of the same type were no issue.

The real gem with this game outside of the main storyline's 'Statesman Simulator' is the Tenebrous Depths. It plays like an oldschool roguelike with procedural generated floors enemies and items with a totally not Dungeons & Dragons flair. It's everything I ever wanted in a roguelike complete with obnoxious facemelting traps and my favorite; traps that don't kill you outright, but turn your party into squirrels or some other similar cuddly animal. Speaking of, the option to have cuddly critters pop out of deceased enemies instead of gore? Favorite optional rule. Knife goes in, bunnies come out! What more could anyone want?!

Well, there's mods too. Hundreds of them, several of which greatly improve the quality of life and others which I find a little concerning, like beards for everyone! With great facial hair comes great responsibility friends, even in video games. Don't do something you may regret.

As buggy as it really gets, I want to go into the positives but they are quite obvious, the systems are good, kingdom managment is well done, etc.

All of the good things are undone the moment you start running into the various issues it has, I had many quests break down on me, the game forgetting what choices I made and the consequences of those worse choices imparted on me, etc. I had to go like 10-15 times into the game's JSON file to find and edit the things to what I've actually done but nothing really beats one of the game's final encounters, I've been here for like an hour now, resetting my save to one before it starts, why? Well, because of how buggy house at the end of time is, at the start of the encounter the game strips you off your companions, and you are supposed to find them across a fairly small dungeon, now, what if I tell you that due to the fact that rescuing the companions is tied to cutscenes, so if they bug out, said companions are physically not in game? 
Yeah, because that's the case, so what is happening to me is that I keep trying to fix it, however, the game is refusing to allow me to play, so this playthrough is completely bricked and I am not allowed to access the endgame unless I will use some kind of 3rd party tool to spawn in the companions which I think is fair to say, bullshit. 

I still think that the game is solid, however I believe that the consumer should be aware of the fact that this can happen.

[b]Is it true that many of the enemies in the game have unfair advantages that they should not have according to the pathfinder ruleset?[/b]
This is true.


[b]The difficulty is broken then.[/b]
No it's not.


[b]What? You are contradicting yourself![/b]
Let me explain. While the enemies are having advantages, many people ignore the fact that you, the player, are also having unfair advantages. You have the ability to control and build 6 characters in [b]perfect[/b] synergy, which is not often possible in a tabletop campaign where players are individuals who have individual ideas for their characters. Another advantage that the player has is that you are often allowed ample time to prepare before combat. It is almost always the case that you will be able to spot the enemy before they spot you and initiate combat.


[b]If the difficulty of the game truly is justified, then why are there so many negative reviews about it? Explain this![/b]
I will analyze this alongside many other mindsets that people leaving negative reviews may have.
[b][u]Bear in mind that I'm not saying this game is perfect, actually it's far from it, I'm just trying to address some of the negative reviews that this game doesn't deserve.[/u][/b]


Here are some mindsets some negative reviewers are having:
[olist]
[*][b][u]I'm too reluctant to turn down the difficulty[/u].[/b]  The normal difficulty is normal for a CRPG, in fact I feel the challenging difficulty is akin to Baldur's Gate 1's normal difficulty. If you are not an experienced CRPG player then it is absolutely normal to feel that the normal difficulty is too hard. Just turn it down to easy or story mode. The most important thing here is for you to enjoy yourself, instead of beating yourself and then blaming the game for it. Make use of the fact that you can tune the difficulty any time you like and the long list of dfficulty options.
[*][b][u]The game is run by a bad GM.[/u][/b][u] [/u]I can definitely understand this sentiment. But this is an isometric CRPG, and not a TRPG campaign. In a TRPG, the most important thing is to let the story continue and to not let the party get wiped in trivial fights. But if we do that in a CRPG, then the game would just not be fun anymore. There would be no challenge because the player knows that he cannot die in this fight, and that he would only need to spend his spell slots on important fights.
[*][b][u]There's a timer in the first chapter and thus this game sucks.[/u][/b][u] [/u]This is just unfair. The timer in the first chapter actually contributes to the game. It prevents players from spamming rest(which has always been a problem for games like this), and adds another layer of strategic thinking to the game. Do I push forward with my already tattered team or do I rest, wasting time and risking being attacked? Do I rest in the dungeon to save time or do I run outside to rest to save rations? The resource management aspect of the game is greatly enhanced and I couldn't be more happy. You really shouldn't ignore an important game mechanic and then blame the game when your game ends. The most ridiculous excuse I've read in the reviews is that ""I'm already dealing with time management IRL and then I have to do it in a game? Unacceptable!"". By this logic, all strategy games suck then I guess.
[*][b][u]Hating the ruleset.[/u][/b] It's not the game's fault if there's a certain aspect of the pathfinder ruleset that you hate. It's stated in the ruleset that swarms can only be killed with aoe, trolls can only be killed with fire or acid, and low level fights are heavily based on RNG. if you dislike these things it seriously is not the game's fault.
[*][b][u]Not reading stuff or taking hints.[/u][/b] This is a CRPG, it is important and is expected of you to read things. The fact that there's a timer, that trolls can't be killed unless with fire or acid, are all stated in the dialogues. If you didn't pay attention to what NPCs are saying, then it's not the games fault that you are having a hard time. For example people shouldn't blame the game when your party is wiped out by a will-o-wisps after resting in a camp not set up by you AND IS SURROUNDED BY DEAD BODIES THAT DIED IN HORROR WITH BURN MARKS ON THEM. There's even a book about will-o-wisps that you can read at oleg's. It is completely justified though if you are frustrated by the swarms on the day the game is released, when there's no hint that swarms can't be killed normally at all. But since then the game has added warnings about that.

But enough with this anti-review review shit, [b][u]here's some actual valid criticism:[/u][/b]
[olist]
[*][b][u]The game is buggy.[/u][/b] Don't buy the game right now, wait a few weeks or months after the developers have fixed most of the bugs(they are doing quite a good job fixing bugs right now so I have faith). This game is a buggy mess in its current state.
[*][b][u]Some builds don't work.[/u][/b][u] [/u] There's some certain feats and functions of some certain classes that don't work right now and it can be frustrating if you want to recreate your campaign character and he happens to be one of the few classes influenced by this.
[*][b][u]UIs are not explained clearly. [/u][/b]This sucks.
[*][b][u]You are expected to be experienced with Pathfinder.[/u][/b] The game makes no effort to explain a lot of pathfinder mechanics. So google is your good friend when playing this game.
[*][b][u]Writing quality can be inconsistent. [/u][/b]Sometimes the writing is fantastic, sometimes it's cringy and tryhard.
[*][b][u]No console commands. [/u][/b]Really? In a complex CRPG like this? Owlcat give us console commands please!
[*][b][u]Too many loading screens.[/u][/b]
[*][b][u]Difficulty could've been handled better.[/u][/b] Yes I was justifying this game's difficulty but as I said, this game is not perfect. Instead of boosting enemy stats the developers could increase difficulty by making AIs smarter or introducing better tactics for enemies. Currently the enemies use the same tactics on all difficulty(i.e. spamming hold person or scare) which can make lower difficulties harder than it should be and higher difficulties unsatisfying. Still, the difficulty is far from broken like what many people claim.

This game is a pretty faithful conversion of the tabletop Pathfinder system to a video game, this might be a good thing for the hardcore fans of the tabletop, but as someone who  dabbles in game design, I don't think it was the most rational choice. For example, at earlier levels, it will be nigh impossible to hit things consistently, be it they owlbears or petty kobolds. If you didn't create a ""meta"" build from early levels with prior knowledge of how Pathfinder works, you might miss ten hits in a row against a raggedy goblin and quit the game in frustration. Now, this can also happen when playing tabletop at early levels, but since playing tabletop is a social ordeal and you usually have friends around, it is infinitely less frustrating than when you are alone staring at a screen. I really wish they took some liberties and made the game more of a video game rather than a 1 to 1 conversion of the tabletop system, the problem I gave an example as and many other issues I have could have been avoided that way. But alas, this was their first game and considering how long and ambitious the game is, I think it is still worth playing, just do yourself a favor and adjust the difficulty to a level where the game is actually fun, hell, cheat through the game to enjoy the setting and characters if you want. 

I still think my time spent playing the game was not spent in vain and that you should give it a try too if you want, just do a little research and know what you are getting into beforehand, look up tutorials and walkthroughs and such if you need to. I would, in the end, recommend this game solely for its amazing setting and interesting story.

But ultimately, P:KM is a tedious, boring, overly complicated game.

At its core, it's just your average CRPG. Except the Pathfinder system, which throws at you dozens upon dozens of middly interesting abilities and subclasses, is really awful, or at least, really poorly translated in a video game. 

In normal difficulty, your party will be pretty much too strong for the game by the end of chapter 2. At this point, since it's somehow unable to offer you a tactical challenge, the game will throw at you dozens of mobs that have annoying abilities: stat or level drains, incredibly high armor or dodge. Are those mobs hard to defeat? No, they're just a nuisance meant to slow you down, cast buff or dispel whatever it is they did to your characters. Every once in a while, you'll encounter a boss that's supposed to pose a challenge. Except, once again, you'll be able to force your way through the encounter by applying a dozen of buffs.

I'm almost at the end of the game, and at no point did I have to restart a fight thinking I should change my strategy, bring another character or swap my gear. The few times I died, I simply tried again, with more buffs, and hoping for a few more critical hits. 

""Then why don't you up the difficulty?"" you ask. Because it doesn't change a thing: you just apply more buffs, even for fights against trash mobs, and hope your characters won't get instagibbed before it's all over.

But what about the rest? Bar a few exceptions, the NPC companions are pretty forgettable, the game is filled to the brim with filler content (small maps copy/pasted a dozen times over, with a different named mob here and there). The Kingdom management is atrocious, the plot is meh...

The game is a time sink with no pay off. You can boot the game, play one hour, and realize you haven't done anything exciting or interesting, but spent your time on the kingdom management screen, reading endless lore tidbits for the absolute most vanilla fantasy setting, going through endless dialogues, or doing shitty fetch and carry quests that would have looked bad in Baldur's Gate, back in 1998.

So yeah, be smarter than me. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Go for Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, or even the next Pathfinder game (apparently much better than this one).",1671140196,1671140196,False,27,1,0.640931189060211182,0,True,False,False

The UI is great, the graphics are solid, the writing is descent, and the game runs smoothly.  If it weren't for two major issues, Kingmaker would be a very respectable classically styled CRPG.  

Issue 1:  Once the first act of the game is completed a new system is added to the game.  Kingdom management.  As the land's ruler, you will be choosing advisors and sending them to perform tasks which take certain amounts of in-game time to complete and then resolve with a die-roll.  Not only does it suck to spend a week of in-game days waiting for an advisor to return only to find out they rolled low and failed at a thing they're ostensibly good at, but it's also actually possible to make things substantially more difficult for yourself based on which tasks you choose to attempt and which you fail.  You often won't know the consequences of your choices until well after you've made them and, should you do poorly enough at managing your kingdom, you can lose the whole game regardless of how successful you've been at the adventuring side of things.  It is a poorly thought-out system that really doesn't add much to the game even when it goes well.  Fortunately, you can set Kingdom Management to automatic, ignoring one of the game's larger mechanical systems in favor of not being hassled by its poor design.  

Issue 2:  The Pathfinder ruleset ****ing sucks.  Pathfinder 1st Edition is a tabletop RPG system designed over a decade ago, and based on an even older edition of D&D.  Its needlessly bloated rules don't translate well to a computer game, and players without much knowledge of the tabletop game can easily create a party of characters who just aren't good enough to beat the game's harder encounters.  Moreover, there are a zillion little, pointless inconveniences riddled throughout the game by a slavish adherence to an outdated ruleset not created for this medium.  For much of the early game, magic is laughably weak and extremely limited.  This lack of effectiveness extends to consumables as well, which are overly plentiful, but either extremely inefficient or extremely specialized.  Character screens are similarly bloated with abilities, feats, and class features that have so little impact on the game it's puzzling why they exist at all.  

As the game goes on though, a new problem with the ruleset arises.  Buffing and debuffing.  You'll start to face more and more encounters in which, if the proper buffs and debuffs aren't applied via spell or consumable beforehand, the odds of winning are extremely low.  There are dozens of spells in Pathfinder that each counter exactly ONE threat or condition.  Characters cannot have enough spells available to them at once to cover all possible encounters the game will throw at them, so a great deal of time is spent running ahead, seeing what enemies are coming, and then reloading to rest and change out prepared spells in order to largely trivialize a fight as your party is now protected against whichever strengths the upcoming monsters have.  

The Pathfinder ruleset wasn't made for video games, and it's already a regurgitation of an older D&D edition that had run its course before Pathfinder ever launched.  The ruleset is clunky, bloated, poorly thought out, a slave to its own brand of ""realism"", and makes Kingmaker an absolute chore to play.  Which is a shame because, with the exception of the kingdom management system, this game is otherwise quite well made.",1670904110,1670906577,False,2,0,0.479284733533859253,0,True,False,False

Classic tabletop feel, tons of customizability, likeable companion NPCs, fun high fantasy vibes. Combat can be crunchy, and if you're used to waltzing through easy combat encounters (Dragon Age Inquisition style), you may want to turn the difficulty down here, or get ready to die a lot. The game's combat mechanics rewards preparation and strategy. Highly recommended for older folks with fond memories of the isometric D&D RPG craze of the 90s and early 00s.

EDIT: I've now almost finished the game and it's become clear to me that this is a game that follows the philosophy of ""Pathfinder is great and should be emulated to the letter!"" and not ""How can we make Pathfinder into a fun CRPG experience?"" Throughout the last few chapters of the game, encounters seem to consist of your entire party getting shitfucked with attribute damage, negative levels, paralysis, and other spells that aren't fun to deal with. There's a reason why most CRPGs don't have ""Your entire party doesn't do shit while the enemy murders them"" spells that the enemy uses on you - it's just not fun to play against.

Pathfinder defo scratches that Baldurs Gate itch, but the more I delve into the game, the more i find it ridiculously bloated to the point where I feel like I spend 15 minutes activating everyone's skills before each encounter.  Feats. skills, spells, buffs.... throw on top of that kingdom management, timed quests, and one of the most convoluted character creations i've ever seen and Pathfinder is just bewildering.  I feel like i need spreadsheets and PA just to keep track of half the things that're going on.

I was unfamiliar with the Pathfinder TTRPG when i started playing this, which I understand to be a complex take on one of the older, beardy and pre ""Vin Disel playing it on Youtube"" editions of DND.  That actually makes a lot of sense to me, as I can imagine being able to get to grips with one set of cryptic rules and endless stats for ONE character, as you would do in table top.  Hell, I might even enjoy playing a half-elf kleptomaniac alchemically enhanced lawful neutral bard-barian who gets a +1.9% to charisma checks if they've eaten Korean BBQ within the last 24 hours.  but six characters?  I'll see myself out then.  and before any of you pathfinder fanatics snarks in, yes I will be going back to my 5e game with my inferior intellect and my not even multiclassed Paladin.  

Again, not to say its bad, but it makes the likes of Divinity OS 2 and Dragon Age Origins feel spartan by comparison.

In all honesty, this is about as complete of a isometric ttrpg experience as you can get.

I didn't play around with the mercenaries (which, to my knowledge, allows even more 'custom' characters than just the main PC), but the NPCs provided are well-rounded and entertaining, to the point that I found myself actively swapping out members to play around with compositions (though by endgame, I had definitely found a 'optimal' crew). 

If you don't have that much time to dedicate to a single-player experience, PF:KM is definitely not for you.

Thus far, this isn't the game I expected, but for me in a good way. I was expecting a second-rate Pillars of Eternity meets a somewhat-better version of the Keep mechanics from NWN2. But it's both more and less than that. For me, it's has more better aspects than poor ones.

It is HARD, and unpredictably so, early on, but gets easier later. This will be patched out, I am sure. For now, if you pine after the sort of challenge Day One Dragon Age: Origins had, grab it now. It is possible to win with minimal loading on Challenging Difficulty with XP sharing off, but it takes some knowledge of the Pathfinder mechanics, the willingness to run away from fights, grinding an extra level, heavy buffing and scouting. There's one fight in particular that is extremely hard, that others have mentioned. If this sounds not your sort of game, turn it down to Normal or switch off a few options in Custom. And that's fine, there's no need to play in a way you don't enjoy.

The lighting and shadows are very competent, and it looks much more atmospheric and less cartoony with the graphics turned up, if you have the hardware to run it.

It's a more traditional experience than Pillars of Eternity. And it's been well-executed. The Characters and story are slightly cliched, but I find it acceptable.

I am enjoying it more than I thought I would. If you've been starved of a good dungeon run, then this is the game for you.

I'm 150 hours in at Act  3 because I'm obsessive about the kingdom and developing builds for each of the default companions. The Pathfinder system allows MUCH more flexibility in character classes and builds. I still like D&D 5e more but Pathfinder's hybrid class customization is much better. Using the storyline companions (not build-your-own mercenaries) makes the story much more engaging. The companion quests are detailed, unique, and worthwhile.
Suggestions:
1) Use a walkthrough, especially once you get to the kingdom management. Otherwise the events and projects and companion quests all running simultaneously is just overwhelming. Two good ones are by kimagure and Chris Williams on Neoseeker.
2) Google some recommended class builds because you can do some wild and cool stuff instead of just traditional roles. Sneak attacking ranged OP. Cleric/Mage hybrid called Theurge can nuke and heal. Kineticist is supposedly the strongest but confused me so I left the demon twins at home.
3) You can romance demon twins. The fact that this has no bad consequences is perhaps less realistic than anything in any game ever.
4) Amiri Sacred Huntmaster with Smilodon pet and Ekundayo Ranger20 with Dog pet and Tristian the nuke healer could probably 3 man the game.  Dog is better tank than Valerie. Max Valerie's Charisma and leave her home to run the kingdom as Regent.
Good builds in this thread:
https://www.gog.com/forum/pathfinder_kingmaker/companion_builds/

5) Buy the 3 bags of holding when you can (no rush) and then buy BP (build points) from Hassuf in order to buy the additional land regions.  Events need to be addressed within a month. Projects can be postponed until you have the time and money. All of this should be explained more clearly in the game.
6) For a Good aligned kingdom the following advisors are compatible choices. Companions can adventure with you while also managing advisor roles.
Regent: Valerie   Counselor:Tristian   Priest:Harrim (solid, just emo)   
7) Unless you are playing on the absolute hardest difficulty, there is no need to dump your companions for custom mercenaries. Ekundayo Ranger single classed with his dog tank full buffed can carry. Linzie Bard/Rogue will bring best buffs and her light xbow sneak attack damage is acceptable. Octavia will ramp up in later game with extended duration Haste and Disintegrate spell specialization. Arcane Trickster build allows sneak attack, maximized Disintegrates for the type of damage you would expect for a high-level mage.",1667189879,1670204491,True,11,1,0.616535842418670654,0,True,False,False

It is in my opinion one of the deepest and most customizable cRPG to date with some of the steepest learning curve due to the sheer amount of option you have while creating a character and playing the game. (and due of course the game not doing a good job explaining the systems unique to the Pathfinder setting).
Considering this was Owlcat first game and just how ambitious this thing is its miracle that we can even play this let alone be this good. You will find everything here that you want from a cRPG , a nice loveable disfunctional party of ""heroes"" , classic dungeon crawling , fidgeting with statistics - inventory stuff , spending an hour on google looking for an aswer to some obscure interaction because you not sure if its works  , really everything is here.
And as i said the game is also insanely customizable there is a lot of option to tweak the game difficulty and systems to your liking hell , even the weakest part of the game the 'Kingdom management' can be customized to a level where i would say its kinda fun - in a 'number go up me happy' kinda way. 
And a special shoutout to composers , the game has some very nice tunes. Oh and be prepared that this is a long game , like really long.

This game was a majority of the time enjoyable, but there would need to be many quality of life changes for me to be able to give this game a fully positive review. Not to completely shit on the creators bc they did loose that license and thus did not continually bug fix and update past its release as should have been.

 I was very closely to the end and could not bring myself to finishing due to the gruellingly long mobs and lack of ability to heal at the very end. I am not someone who is a fan of grinding or souls games so I am coming towards this as a purely story/lore/immersion gamer. I had to change the difficulty aspects halfway through to all easiest choices because I felt that the choices you have to make/and events that occur left you at such a disadvantage that If we were given tools to prepare...  well problems would not have occurred realistically. And yes, that's kind of the point of the big bad but it really did not feel fun mostly. 

This is my personal opinion^ but what really killed me was that you could play this game 2 times and still figure out ""OH my god I wish I knew I had access to (blank)"" and I actually restarted the game after finishing the troll chapter because of that. And my second playthrough, chapters later, just after I paid for 3 merc ""advisors"" I found out you could BUY BP with GOLD. The massive facepalm I did... 

  This game is almost like an alpha build. It just needed some finishing touches, bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and some sort of an ""ABSOLUTELY FOR DUMMIES"" difficulty level... I dunno. To be honest this game is fun and amazing... The beginning mansion tutorial honestly does not do the majority of the game justice and the thing is I found myself just wanting the damn game to end at well, the end.

A game can be excellent and yet not be everyone's cup of tea. I feel this is the case with Pathfinder: Kingmaker.

This game is fantastic as far as I'm concerned. The relatively lower rating deterred me from buying it, but if you're looking for something similar to Baldur's Gate I/II this is THE game. I personally prefer this to either Pillars of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin, although make no mistake that both of those are excellent games as well and probably are better suited to most people's gaming tastes.

Why, then, do I think this game has a relatively low rating? Well, when it first launched, it was in a much buggier state and had some balance issues that needed to be worked out. That's one half of it. The other is that I think a lot of players did not quite understand what they were getting into and ended up bouncing off the game hard.

PF:KM is in the tradition of traditional CRPGs. It's not tweaked for modern sensibilities to the same degree that PoE and D:OS are. Back in the day, the market wasn't nearly as flooded with great options all vying for your time. When you bought a game like Baldur's Gate, that was it for a while. You spent months and years with it, learning its ins-and-outs and exploring every corner. You learned what places to avoid early on, where certain treasures were, and how to create the types of builds that could tackle the highest difficulty levels with ease. You could expect to spend hours and perhaps days trying to figure out how to beat a particular boss fight and learned to save often because you never quite knew when that boss fight might show up. ""Ironman"" style runs were for those who were familiar with the territory.

That's the philosophy that PF:KM was obviously designed around. If you try to see everything in a single run through, you're going to have a bad time because the developers made that a near-impossible task. This game is not meant to be played on ""challenging"" during your first run through, especially if you've never played an old-school CRPG before (and, again, as fantastic as they are, PoE and D:OS don't really count). If you bite off more than you can chew before you're ready for it, you're going to get stomped. It's old-school hard, which means unfair unless you've got some experience under your belt from playing it a bunch of times before.

My advice to anyone approaching this without having played a game like BG I/II is this: take it for what it is. A game that's meant to be played multiple times. Don't try to see everything in your first run. Play your first game on a difficulty level that's below what you'd normally start with -- there's no shame playing on ""Easy"" your first time through! Kingdom Management is tough and you should consider setting it to Automatic or to the Easiest level your first time as well -- save the tougher settings for when you know what you're doing. Understand that you're going to come up against fights that you have no chance of winning, and learn to avoid those areas until you're obviously better equipped to win them. Above all, quicksave often, after every fight if necessary that first time. Save your epic ""ironman"" run at the highest difficulty for when you know what you're up against. Sometimes it's not that a game is unbalanced so much as people overestimate their own gaming prowess.

My only quibbles with this game are that it's not particularly well optimized (I have a top-of-the-line laptop NVIDIA card and still play on low graphics settings) and I wish there was a hotkey for changing weapons sets. Voice acting isn't always great but I find it amusing and that's not really what I play a game like this for anyway. The story line is great, the characters are excellent (make sure to actually get to know them!), and the game play is exactly what I've been looking for. I really do believe that this game could one day be looked back upon as fondly as Baldur's Gate, and that's high praise.

But, again, games like this aren't for everyone.",1669570757,1669570876,True,1,0,0.495495498180389404,0,True,False,False

Simply put: there are better games that capture what Pathfinder: Kingmaker was attempting to be.

Lorian Studios captures the essence of what a TTRPG simulator ought to be with both Divinity Original Sin (I & II) and Baldur's Gate III

Which is an incredible shame since Baldur's Gate III has yet to even be fully released as of this review.
This game has the bone works of something great, but is fundementally flawed in its poor attempts to be more lore-focused and less gameplay-focused. Around a tabletop or among friends and on paper, this might translate to the DM doing their homework appropriately. However, in a video game setting, it fails to encompass the overarching sense that the player is truly in control.
A few things really stick out after being spoiled by Lorian Studios:
- The camera angle sucks. 
I can tell these are 3d models but for whatever reason, the player is unable to rotate the camera whatsoever.

- The UI is a cluttered mess. 
I understand that the kind of people coming into this game should be somewhat proficient in the Pathfinder (or DnD equivelent) system. However, between dozens of classes and race combination, there is simply too much information being pushed forward within the first hour of the game for a normal player to comprehend. Not to mention, in a game published in 2018, you would expect the interface to look like it belonged in the modern century and not from a game that came out in the 90s while running windows XP.

- Character Customization
C'mon. Even Dragon Age: Origins had a better character customization than what we have in this game. Five options for each slider and character portraits that look nothing like what we are aiming for. Piss poor execution for whatever happened there.

Looking back on this review, I could say more, but enough has already been said. You want a good game like this, only better in every conceivable way? Try these:

It can be grueling, however. Character creation and leveling really needs on-line research to be done well. The Pathfinder mechanics are complicated, and the game generally does a poor-to-mediocre job explaining them. I found the default real-time-with-pause mode is unplayable: It must be played in turn-based mode, and it's shocking this was a late addition to the game (originally just a mod). And really, I don't know if I could've completed it without some fairly powerful cheat mods - the ""rest"" situation in dungeons given the absurd weight of rations is particularly. rage-quit level untenable on at least two occasions (fortunately, the mods available are plentiful and quite robust).

There are few skills that don't really serve much of a purpose (Like Stealth) and some missed features (Like Trap Making) but overall, that part of the game it's a pass. There's tons of content and the world is interesting to explore...............

NOW ON TO WHY I GIVE THIS A FAIL:
There is a City Management system: Before you get all hot and steamy thinking Civilization with Magic and Necromancer Dragons, it's much simpler and closer to a mobile game. (IF we're being honest that's insult to mobile games) It's very, very, very basic nothing is explained, it breaks the flow of the game, is boring as beans and no matter what you do you'll still mess up because the game's core story requires you to mess up. You can do everything right, have enough BP (Which is effectively just gold used for kingdom management) have good enough advisors, pass all the events that pop up in your kingdom and still almost lose everything multiple times with absolutely no explanation given. If you're asking yourslef now ""Why even bother with it then? Surely I can just ignore it."" NOPE. If your kingdom crumbles, it's game over. 

Second problem: 
Like I mentioned before, the world is big and interesting and there's a lot of stuff to do. The problem is the game doesn't want you to do it all and explore it all because everything is on a timer. While the actual quests that are on time sensitive can be completed without any issue and still explore most, if not all, of the games worlds the same can't be said for the kingdom management which as we've already established if your kingdom crumbles it's over.

There are certain events that you need to complete to prevent your barony from losing that are time sensitive. Some are specific, some are generic. All of them take in game days to complete, some of them many in-game days. There are a few different type of events you'll get: Problems and Opportunities. You can ignore the Opportunities, you can't ignore the problems. These events usually reappear in your kingdom management interface around the start of every in-game month, If you are not there when they come up or your advisors are all busy doing other things, it could start a chain reaction that leads to you losing the game later on down the road. 

In a way you can very easily soft-lock yourself at the start of the game.

ON TOP OF ALL THIS THE EVENTS YOU HAVE YOUR ADVISORS DEAL WITH ARE RNG BASED
There are two ways you can improve the odds of your advisor succeeding. The First is a currency called ""Crisis Coins"" these boost the odds I think about 25%, but you don't get very many. You do get more later on, but it's never a meaningful amount. 

The other way is by leveling up your advisor. The problem: That takes time, usually about 14 in-game days. During that 14 days you can't do anything.  Oh, and the game doesn't freeze time outside those 14 days. In otherwords, if you have a quest that needs to be completed in 20 days, you stop to upgrade your advisor (Because you have to, if not that could be game over later on) you'll have six days to complete that quest. Problems will come up over those 14 days and you will get the same punishment if you fail to complete them even though you literally can't do anything.

Never have I ever personally played an RPG that went to such extremes to punish you for exploring it. 

But to be clear: The core game is decent. The Combat is about what you'd expect, the game play is pretty good, the world is interesting enough, the story is decent enough. But the city management and everything being time sensitive kills it. The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs down is because you unfortunately have to bother with the city building stuff to not stop you from losing the game but also progress the game.

Oh, and Skill-checks are RNG based, fuck that noise.

This game is just not fun. It could be, but it's filled with mechanics that are tedious and frustrating and don't add anything to the story, immersion or sense of accomplishments. Weather that is entirely random but can disable half your team because why not? Excruciatingly slow travel because moving from point A to point B to progress the story is always exciting. Resting which is just as entertaining as watching a loading screen, only to prevent your characters from moaning about fatigue. Everything is on a timer, but the game won't tell you, or give you tools to manage your time effectively. 

Even if you manage to turn a blind eye on all these, the quests and encounters are mostly designed around ""gotchas"" - you either happen to have the character or items the devs intended to solve this situation, in which case things are trivial, or not, in which case it's impossible without tons of reloading. Very fun indeed. Maybe I could still push through all these shortcomings, but in the end, the story itself is not all that memorable, the choices you face are all cliche, and the companions utterly flat.

And the last thing: you can't just take a system from a multiplayer tabletop game and plop it into single player PC context without alterations. Randomness that's inherent in the system and normally takes the DM to weave an exciting story from your failures just doesn't work when your main tool for dealing with it is ""reload"" because failure is just that on a PC, there's no alternative path.

Overall, this game could be used as a study of bad game design. I've tried to play it twice and rage quit twice. Save yourself the pain and disappointment, avoid this title.

Pathfinder KM presents an excellent vehicle for making the player invested in the plot of the campaign.
Whether exercising Machiavellian cruelty or subscribing to a more restrictive code of ethics, moral choices feel organic - of special note: ""evil"" is empathize-able, and doesn't suffer the low-effort, skull worshiping Harry-Potter villain immersion breaking pitfalls of other titles.

I strongly recommend playing the game with the campaign companions. Yes, their stats may not seem optimal, but with the plethora of gear / buffs / ___ available to you, that really shouldn't be a problem that cannot be overcome (I currently feel invincible on a [Hard] - penultimate difficulty - campaign), but the dialog they add to various encounters is just *chefs kiss*.
I would be highly surprised if you don't see a little bit of yourself in each character.
+1 for a positive representation of an ethical non-monogamous relationship.

Combat is challenging but fair. I'm turn-based-for-life, but a toggle is there for those fights where you need to fast-forward through 12 nat20s criticals (I'm looking at you, ______). If something feels impossible there is VERY likely a tool that SOME class just acquired which massively checked whatever feels overpowered.
It's a multi-class free game. Experiment.
Final note on experimentation*: I recommend playing about an hour-2h in the endless dungeon mode, fail at building a few characters, test a few spells out, it will save you a lot of frustration and time if you have a tested build that you take into the campaign.

Finally, this game is LOOONG.
I'm talking ""Chi-chan's favorite game"" Long.
The combat will begin to feel a bit repetitive around the end of the 2cnd arc. pace yourself with other games and I guess going outside. You can power through it. I believe in you.

Some tips for people new to CRPGs:
- Set kingdom management to easy.
- Unlock artisans as soon as you can, the gifts they give you can be sold for a pretty penny.
- Look up build guides for the first few levels of characters, I used neoseeker's, they are pretty good especially to make some ""worse"" characters like Octavia shine.
- Save often, up the max amounts of saves you can have in the settings.
- Get the Bag of Tricks mod to customize the game further, it has some nice QoL features.
- If you want to do a romance you better look the guide up, [spoiler] Octavia is almost impossible otherwise [/spoiler].",1668738427,1668738427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don’t like Avellone’s writing at the best of times and knew he worked on this, and a lot of the early reviews I saw said it was pretty dismal. When I bought it myself soon after release the game was buggy, loaded slowly, corrupted constantly, and crashed so hard it made my PC bluescreen. A lot. 

With the disclaimer out of the way, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is hands down one of my favorite games I have ever played.

Every flaw it had on release was made up for by the sheer heart put into the games content. 

I love the absurd depth of the management mechanics (and if you don’t you can turn it off), I love the VA work for the voiced sections, I love the size of the map and being able to explore all of it without ever feeling lost, I love the reactivity to alignment that a lot of games don’t include, I love the spiraling, branching dialogue, the diversity of skillchecks, and I love that it puts you in what looks on first glance to be a Bog Standard Pathfinder Adventure™ and then flips you clean on your ass and says THINK AGAIN. Every time you think you know? You don’t. And it does it without making you feel misled, because when the secrets come out you can see all of them in perfect retrospect.

If you’re looking for gameplay you may want to find a different game. The combat is fairly rote and straightforward, though it certainly gets more fun at higher levels, and the puzzles are far and few inbetween.

Ultimately, the game's difficulty felt like a meatgrinder for people who either really like reading guides or are just very good at intuitively min maxing, as opposed to many other CRPGs which tend to have a wide variety of encounter levels scattered across the world making it possible to routinely go get stronger and try some hard challenge again.

Open map, lots to explore.  Some of the maps are huge, some of the maps are small (like when random encounter happens while traveling).   You could encounter anything from small kobolds to Greater Ancient Water Elementals.  

You also have ability to build an entire kingdom with cities and towns; over time.   This can be automated if you have no desire to do resource management.

NOTE:  I do not recommend this game even though has lots of positives.   Reason:  You can be succesful managing your kingdom until Pitax.   During that time, I lost 2 advisors.  Then pitax constantly lowers your kingdom every single week until destroyed.  You cannot avoid this at all because success rates for the events drop to 0%.   Once that happens game over.

You have the ability to use Real-Time Combat or Turn-Based Combat. By themselves neither is perfect, but the ability to switch back and forth between them instantly is amazing. You can use real-time for easy fights and if something is giving you grief switch to Turn-Based for fine control. The story is top notch with a whole host of like-able companion characters. I'd reccomend it, but play easy or normal for your first time and take your time with it.

You're sitting down at the table to enjoy a fun session of Pathfinder. The DM tells you that you are hot on the trail of an evil Gnome, and you are now following him into a dungeon! Excited for a fun evening, your party heads on down.

The next couple of hours is an absolute gauntlet of giant spiders. The giant spiders rush at you endlessly, and every time they hit you they drain your strength and dexterity scores. Pretty soon you're all out of spell slots, but luckily the party Barbarian is completely overpowered and you just have to hold out until she can finish one-shotting all the spiders. At one point, your party Bard doesn't notice a trap, and webs cover everybody! The DM makes everybody roll repeatedly to get out, but the party Cleric literally can't do it because his dexterity has been drained so much.

""There aren't any spiders left,"" you say. ""Can we just assume the Cleric eventually gets out?""

""No,"" the DM says. ""He's not going anywhere until he breaks free.""

After 10 minutes of the entire table sitting and watching as the Cleric repeatedly tries to break free (the DM only lets him roll once every 6 seconds), somebody in the party climbs up a ladder and the DM, worried about the party splitting, declares that the Cleric has escaped and follows everybody else up. That's weird, but okay.

Mangled and out of spells, the party heads back up to the forest above the dungeon to rest for the night. That Gnome will be trapped in there, after all! As the party takes part in some campfire roleplay, the DM rolls on some random encounter tables. For the next two hours of the session, the camp is attacked by swarms of wolves, wildcats, and even a skeleton for some reason. It's non-stop. In one of these encounters, the DM asks who is keeping watch, and then has wolves burrow out of a hill-side to directly maul the people sleeping on the ground. You declare that you are standing up to join the fight, and the DM reveals that standing up from prone triggers an opportunity attack. You are unconscious! Luckily, the Barbarian kills all the wolves and you all eventually get enough rest to get your spells back. You all agree to make up the difference in hp by just chugging a bunch of potions.

Another hour later, as the night drags to its ultimate conclusion, you reach the end of the dungeon after smashing through a swarm of very powerful skeletons. The DM giggles in excitement as he reveals that the Gnome actually isn't here! This whole dungeon has been nothing more than a distraction. Yes, even though he SAID that the Gnome was down here earlier, he was just saying that to trick you into going down there. The Gnome has actually gone off to some other location you weren't aware of.

This isn't just one of the worst RPG sessions you could possibly imagine. This is actually what Pathfinder: Kingmaker is like.

EDIT: Like every good story about a bad RPG session, I came back to this a year later and played some more (as you can see from the extra 58 hours up above.

My verdict hasn't really changed. Cast Grease on a tight hallway to knock down some Trolls? It feels great when you're doing it, but you aren't dispelling that Grease without a mod, which means you are waiting 1 real time minute per level for it to go away (or trying to rush your low-DEX characters through it).

In one encounter, some Trolls attacked a guy's house. The party rushed to defend him, fighting through an entire army of them to get downstairs to the cellar where he was hiding. We got down there and there were three trolls standing on either side of him. They had completely pulverized him by the time we got down the stairs. A single set of actions from the party wiped the Trolls out and then we quickly rushed to the guy's aid.

""Curse you for not helping me!"" he said in dialogue, before immediately dying. Why was the encounter set up this way? No idea. Why couldn't we use one of the six Raise Dead scrolls in my backpack? No idea. I guess I could have savescummed until I got to a timeline where I was able to interpose myself between him and the Trolls in time, but I didn't really feel like it.

In another instance, I went to a haunted tower surrounded by Will-o-Wisps. These things are the bane of pretty much every player in the game, but there is a way to defeat them! If you cast the spell Glitterdust on them, the dust wraps around their bodies, defeating their invisibility! Luckily, Linzi the Bard is able to use Glitterdust, either because she learned it while levelling or just by casting it as a scroll. Her and the party wizard are both also able to cast ""See Invisibility"" so we can spot them as we come up the road. This is *great* encounter design! We studied an enemy that we had fought previously (the Glitterdust trick I actually learned from an NPC who revealed a plot by a Will-o-Wisp and did it himself), learned things that could defeat it, and then spent some time preparing what we needed to overcome this threat. This is the kind of stuff I love!

So the party goes up the hill with See Invisibility on and a Will-o-Wisp pops out of invisibility and lightning strikes the entire party, killing us instantly. I guess I was being too aggressive. On attempt two, I inch my way up with See Invisibility cast on the person with the highest Perception skill. It happens again! Maybe See Invisibility just doesn't work, so this time Linzi inches up so she can cast Glitterdust on the section of narrow path the Will-o-Wisp showed up before. Nothing there. The party walks up and BAM, Will-o-Wisp kills everybody. Confused, I look this up to see if it is a bug or something, and it turns out that creatures that start out invisible simply do not exist until you are close enough to be ambushed. They spawn in at the start of the ambush, meaning spells that counter invisibility are solely for in-combat purposes and cannot be used to defend yourself from an ambush.

(Incidentally, there *is* a spell that you want to use at this tower - Communal Protection from Energy - Electricity will trivialize it. So, I mean, I guess Owlcat kinda did the thing I like, but also not really?)

The storyline is mostly pretty good. Valerie's romance dialogue is pretty unpleasant,  because you basically need to be really flippant about the heartfelt stuff she's confiding in you about and pull some truly awful pick up lines out of your fedora. I imagine other romances are likely the same way, but can't really confirm. Otherwise, you get to do a lot of dungeoneering and classic fantasy adventuring, which can often pull you into that authentic RPG experience until the next horrible thing comes up - be it an army of visually identical zombie cyclopes hiding a single priest who is casting Hold Person on your party, or a friendly neighbour who repeatedly invites you to visit his lands across a mountain chain but is never actually available to host you when you arrive (appears to be an actual oversight where the developers genuinely didn't think anybody would accept the invitation for some reason, rather than the NPC being intentionally rude), or a pair of giant stone elementals just randomly showing up on the road between two of your towns to beat you up - and takes you right out of it.

This is an 80+ hour campaign with missable events and revolves around a kingdom management minigame and time management mechanics that can be stressful for some, but as a tradeoff adds depth and real decision-making to mechanics like traveling and resting. 

If that sounds up your alley, you'll definitely like this. If you just want the adventuring component, there is an automated kingdom management setting that alleviates part of that extra management, but the game's story still revolves around running a country, and there are still time limits and timed events.

This game could have been great.
But it sucks. Seriously.

That not everything (read: very little) of the vastly complex ruleset is documented could be forgiven. But way too often the mechanics simply do not work as described.

A lot of your choices have totally arbitrary consequences, this game is full of tiny little triggers and you'll be surprised what they toggle. Often without giving you a clue. So you resort to the community to sort out bugs and features and this inadvertedly spoils the story.

At a certain point in game you realise that the designers were in over their heads and could not find any ""normal"" ways to improve difficulty, so they resorted to randomness. 

Maybe enjoyable in story-mode, but due to the horrible balancing you'll need a lot of meta information.
The whole reason for tabletop-rulesets is to ensure balancing and a sense of fairness, but this game feels like your DM hates you. Not just garden variety ""rocks fall"" hates you - it feels more like you've eaten his offspring and now he is out for your soul. 

I initially enjoyed the challenges managing your kingdom entail - sometimes there simply is no solution to all problems- but after a while everthing repeats itself and you'll realise how pointless a lot of the implemented options are.

Oh and i can't remember a single fight that was bug free:
Quite often a command is not executed, because the the game suddenly decides your char walked a cm too far - even though it checked ok before you issued it.

One problem is that theres just too much going on at times. The kingdom management can feel tedious, pointless and isn't really rewarding. You just have to juggle a lot of stuff and don't get much back in return. It's game within a game and poor one that requires a lot of attention.

Another issue is the story. It's rather boring and not intersting enough to carry you through the entire play time. The whole thing feels more like an overblown side-quest than an epic story.

Then theres the bugs. I didnt have any game breaking ones but oh boy, are they annoying. Characters not showing up, quests can be completed and so on. Those are extra frustrating since I sometimes had to force myself to keep playing.

The graphics are quite good, although they could use a lot more options for portraits when making your character (luckily, there are workarounds for that).

If you liked NWN and similar games from the past, you'll likely enjoy this game.

My minor complaints are: 
1. They tacked on an additional play mode in both games. In Kingmaker, it is the kingdom simulator, and in Wrath, it is the chess-like combat game to retake Drezen. In both cases, thankfully, there is a way to minimize or virtually turn off the system if you don't want to play it. However, if you do turn it off, the game can cause you to miss out on some of the juicy adventures your party of six could go on. My opinion is that both games would be better without these added systems. These types of games, after all, are about YOU and the adventures you go on. Having these more ""meta"" systems detracts from that, in my opinion.

2. The companions. Sometimes I like and want to play with the provided companions and other times I don't. This is because the companions are always odd race, class, and personality combinations. It seems like an easy fix to produce the game with an initial option to play with the companions or to play with your own created party. If playing in ""mercenary mode"", all the companions should become NPCs and still provide you with their missions, but only as advisors or tag-alongs to your party. I find it annoying to have to constantly rotate these characters I don't want into my party to do character-specific missions or miss out. There is an option to retrain the provided companions; however, you can only retrain them so much as they keep whatever the companion's default class is and you have to redo that and/or multiclass them to make them more useful to you and your play style. It is also very expensive to replace these companions with mercenaries in-game, too. I'd just like the option, like back in the old Gold Box days, of creating my own party with which to play the adventure. I'd be more invested in each character. Or, have a party of, say, four that you create and no more than two companions at a time. Again, it's a minor complaint and one you can get around, I just think that the creators could make this happen in the games rather than making the player base create mods or use the clunky in-game procedures to overcome these limitations.

All in all, a fun game for those who like the DnD/Pathfinder game genre and are looking for a Gold Box/NWN/Baldur's Gate style gaming experience.",1666968993,1666968993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is pretty good, especially up to the Twice Born Warlord chapter.
The side quests and characters are mostly interesting, and their side quests are well done.

However starting with the Twice Born Warlord chapter the game becomes pretty slow and I had to spend a lot of time in the kingdom interface to skip days.

However, especially the last dungeon (house at the edge of time) is a very annoying grind that requires you to either know what you will be facing or take a bit of time to figure out how to stop the annoying fear spells.

The overall plot is pretty decent, even though it feels like most of the big quests in the end are filler to just make the game longer, because after the Varnhold chapter it's mostly waiting for the big final confrontation - even though this problem might be, because it's based on the existing PnP adventure path (that likely has the same issues).

The DLC dungeon is pretty good, even if the endfight is extremely hard - but the story you find inside the dungeon (if you don't miss it due to it's very high perception checks) is quite nice to read.

In general the game just feels a bit too long and get annoying towards the end, so I would probably rate it as 6.5 or 7 out of 10.",1666711471,1666711471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's plenty of challenge as you're getting started, figuring out your mix of potions, spells, and abilities. As an RPG, this game delivers some excellent lore and engaging story that will keep you hooked for dozens of hours. There's a reason why you're constantly under siege by powerful monsters, which at first is a nice story element but becomes somewhat frustrating as you get further into the game. The real problem is the kingdom management, more specifically the projects that force you to skip ahead by a week or more and miss anything that happened during that time.

[b]READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:[/b] [u]Save (F5) before clicking ""Start Event"" on every project or region capture and reload if you fail anything, especially missed advisor events (e.g., Linzi wants to speak to you).[/u] Because most kingdom projects and region captures lock you into a screen that forces you to skip weeks at a time, you can easily miss critical quests. This includes companion missions and quests that allow you into certain areas of the map that are required toward the end of the game, meaning if you miss these you can't win the game but you pass these dozens of hours before you realize you're stuck and dozens more before you lose the game. In other words you could have played for a week (IRL) without realizing you'll have to go back to an old save if you want to finish the game.

[spoiler]Besides dealing with a game breaking quest fail, you can also miss companion missions while skipping time. This can come back to bite you later as those companions will abandon you because you didn't care about them. You also need to finish all, and I mean all, other quests before you face Nyrissa by going through the stable portal in Castle of Knives during Sound of a Thousand Screams. Anything you don't complete before this will fail, including quests you haven't started yet, like companion missions. So basically wait until you're done with An Ancient Curse, Part Seven, all other Kingdom Quests, and finished the companion missions for all your companions or they will all fail.

Another failing of the game overall is the timers of the An Ancient Curse quest line. You can finish most other quests and be sitting for hours just doing kingdom quests while waiting on the timers. This will allow you to get through the kingdom quests but makes the game rather boring and redundant because you'll see the same events happening over and over. I would suggest you pace yourself and do a few rounds of Rank Ups whenever you get a chance during your adventures. Just remember to save before each and reload if you fail any quests while skipping time.[/spoiler]",1666617619,1666617619,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Owlcat clearly bit off more than they could chew by being too ambitious with their first title. On the technical level, the game still has quest-breaking bugs and there will be no more updates as according to Owlcat's community manager they've lost the rights to this particular game. 

Putting all the technical junk aside, I simply don't like how the devs padded the length of the game. The kingdom management system is a pointless chore, the amount of enemies is increased x3 compared to the original tabletop campaign, and enemy stats are boosted to make them more relevant in the late game. 

It would be somewhat forgivable if not for the last two chapters. Those are so bad that they've retroactively killed all the previous enjoyment. Without going into spoiler territory I could say that The House at the Edge of Time is one of the worst dungeons I've ever had the ""pleasure"" to traverse. The resolution of companion questlines is also a giant F**k you to the player. The game is long AF as it is, and making the endgame so bad makes the 100+ hours you've spent getting there feel like a waste.

Overall I would say that I have had a very positive experience with the game. It’s not perfect, but it is a good adaptation of the pathfinder tabletop game and it is one of the better storylines from the game too. Overall I see two major flaws of the game. But I am able to look past those because I feel that the game overall is solid. 

This is a very story deep game with a lot of reading. If that is not your type of game then this game is not for you. But it is a very good story with a lot of side quests that, for the most part, do not feel shoehorned in. The character leveling is good and feels significant as well. I also really like the kingdom building aspect of the game.  It is a welcome change from the normal RPG format. 

As for the negatives of the game, there are really two that I want to mention. The first is that there are time limits in the game. I really dislike this in a game where you really want to explore. I always find myself wanting to explore and then I get messages that I need to keep progressing the main story or my kingdom will be destroyed. Even right out of the gate you are given 3 months to complete the first act or game over. I wish that didn’t exist so I could explore more and get to the main quest when I feel like it. It also really hampers building the kingdom because that expense time as well. The other issue is that the puzzles are supposed to seem reasonable and a part of the story. This game doesn’t have a lot of puzzles. But the ones I have encountered seem clunky and annoying. I really could have done without the puzzle aspect as those seemed like a waste of time.

Buy the game for the story and exploration factor. The combat system is subpar even to someone who is not familiar with the table-top pathfinder game. Worthy buy when on sale, otherwise hold off.

Initially I was a bit tepid towards the idea of investing any good chunk of time into this game, since I had just come from playing Tyranny. I heard a lot of good reviews of the Tyranny game but I couldn't get myself to play that game because the combat system was so .... dull.

The best way I would describe the issue I had with the combat system is that characters stand around for seconds at a time doing nothing, and they have certain actions queued up, and by the time those actions execute they are usually ineffectual or some other event has happened. The only real way to play the Tyranny game is with pause constantly on. 

Pathfinder seems to share a very similar combat system. And although I do find it pretty frustrating, I think the rest of the game makes it worth putting up with a subpar combat system. I would say this game very much brings back memories of classics such as BGI and II as well as all the other infinity engine games, where the amount of areas to explore in this game are pretty staggering. They clearly spent a lot of effort making that part of the game very enjoyable.",1666473852,1666473852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love RPGs, have a bit of experience playing PnP Pathfinder, and there's so much promise when making a new character that gets me excited to play. It's like nearly everything is there, so many classes to choose from and your choices of feats is astounding. It's a lot to take in, for sure.

But then you get into the game with your new character, and it's just horribly written and cringy dialogue, a story I don't really care about, but soon enough it's time for combat. I want to play turn-based because the game having turn-based mode added to it is what got me interested in playing this game in the first place. But it's clear the game wasn't built around it, and it was just kind of taped on, so it just isn't that fun. You have to be very precise about what you want to do so you don't make a wrong move, and there's 20+ options right from the start for what your character can do on his turn which SOUNDS cool, but is a bit much.

The camera somehow feels perpetually too close to the action, like I just want to be zoomed out so I can clearly see my party and the enemies all at once. Movement outside of combat, they also somehow screwed up, because your characters will not run at full speed unless you click far enough away, so it just feels bad to [i]move around[/i].

I did a few quests through the main story, but I am really just not feeling it. And it's a shame, because I think the game looks good, and there was clearly a lot of effort into bringing so much of the PnP game over to a digital format. The UI especially is just fantastic, I really love the menus and clicking around in the character sheets.

All in all, however, whenever I played this game, I just kept getting a feeling that I could be playing BGII again, so I just went and played that instead.",1640619529,1666355166,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Kingdom management is fairly shallow, relying on a pool of characters that become more and more useless as the game goes on. You've got to metagame and use specific strategies later in the game otherwise it's impossible. If you're going into a fight without at leats 5 different buffs on in the mid-late game, good luck. 

Call me a casual for preferring the Larian games smoother style of progression, but it lends itself to having a much better and smoother experience. I feel like i'm hitting my head against a brick wall here every 5 seconds. Fatigue, resting, kingdom events, management, time management, combat that hates you. Get massive amounts of bad rolls? Suck it up. 

For the least frustrating playthrough, use guides. Rely on other people's minmax builds. Optimise and expand as early as possible, because if you mess up the time managements, look forward to loading 5-10 hours of game to salvage it. 

It can be fun, the story is good, the characters are compelling, other than the fact they have one set of dialogue and there's no point talking to them outside a throne room scenario. The writing is ok, the plot twists kind of seem to come out of nowhere. If you're wanting an RPG to learn all the mechanics and overcome the game, rather than just enjoying the ride, here it is.

post game review: it doesn't get better, it just gets worse. The last dungeon is just bad. Whoever thought Mandragora swarms were a good idea needs to lose their job. 

This game is essentially this: you turn up to a TTRPG campaign, session 1 party wipe. DM asks you to come to every session with a backup character because this is how it's going to be. Every combat encounter needs a long rest after because it isn't balanced.

I have NO idea how far I am in the game. It seems like I'm towards the end of the mid-game? Maybe? There is SO much content. Holy crap. That's probably a positive.

On the other hand, ever since the very beginning of the game, I've felt like it's a constant uphill battle just to be competent at the game. My player character, I seem to be doing fine. I've got some experience with Pathfinder and no experience with Kineticist, so it was a little frustrating when I found that choices I made at level 2 were actually completely useless. The real struggle is with kingdom building. I'm towards the end of the mid-game, but I'm constantly failing kingdom event challenges, because my kingdom stats just aren't high enough, which is probably an extension from failing kingdom events in earlier parts of the game (since those failures deduct your stats). I looked up some suggestions on how to kingdom build and they're summed up to - don't build any of the interesting buildings, just build certain stat-raising buildings from the beginning, use your build points in ONLY X way, and you'll be good for later. I didn't do that. So I'm losing. Maybe? I can't tell. But I'm failing a lot and that probably means I'm losing. But am I losing enough for it to be a problem for gameplay? Who knows! Is there a way to fix this? I don't think so!

I love the concept of kingdom building. I was excited by the idea of directing my kingdom from nothing into something strong.

[b]The Good:[/b]
Graphics are good, more so the art style with incredible backgrounds that look like the classic CRPGS (as we remember them, no how they actually look). The detail to mechanics is just astonishing, that is, until you see how they've upped the ante in the second game. 
The rich RPG system allows tons of working builds and you will waste hours on the Character creation skill. 
In terms of fun - this is like Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2. 
If you like CRPGS, tactical RPGS and enjoy a non-convoluted, simple, light storytelling (so, if you liked Pillars of Eternity, but couldn't withstand the never-ending exposition) you will like this game. Probably.

[b]The Not So Good:[/]
There are still performance issues 4 years after the release, so make sure you save often and restart the game once FPS start to tank on fire/particle effects. 

The biggest issue I have is with the writing (despite mentioning the story in the [b]Good[b/]. On a whole it's not so bad, at least you always understand what you need to do and why, but some parts are abysmal. The whole writing for Betrayer's Flight quest and related character ""chemistry"" almost made me drop the game. This ""twist"" come out of nowhere with very shoddy ""lore/justification"" and and is resolved in one dialog with a binary consequence. Another things that starts to get on your nerves is that your protagonist doesn't have any agency in the transpiring events. Why does he/she want to become a baron in the cursed, undeveloped and dubious part of the world is never explained. You as a player and your character receive no profit for sticking your neck into this mess. Especially once your character learns some lore about the area, why doesn't he/she just leave? You are an outsider to this land and have no ties to it. Even your ""barony"" is explained right at the start as being a puppet state for the Aldori/Surtova. It's outright spelled out to you after the first chapter, so why do you even bother? Same goes for your companions that are presented as your rivals for the chance to become the baron, and then just decide to join you on a whim in the shitshow  that ensues. 

Overall - give it a try, the despite my grievances the game has a lot of charm to it and well put together. Oh, how I wish this team could get their hands on Arcanum and re-imagine it.",1665825042,1665825042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reading  guide is practically useless since it's like talking with an experienced players, you don't understand wth they're talking about.

Casters can't really cast because spells can be used once before sleep is required.  Normal armor makes the character too burdened to walk or fight effectively.    Exploring is an exercise in tedium which proceeds at a snail's pace--because nobody could possibly walk around for 2 hours without hunting for 17 hours and sleeping for 12!  The game is mainly about camping.  Occasionally, characters can walk a tiny distance before needing to camp again.  With 40 hours of play, I do not really understand the combat system.  Characters mostly have to skip the attack part of their combat round because they can't walk and fight at the same time.   Combat proceeds glacially because with 5 characters maybe only 1 or 2 get an actual attack during a round, and almost certainly those attacks will miss.   This repeats until you are out of spells and hit points.  Because 4 on 1 against a bandit obviously favors the lonely bandit not my rag tag band of useless fighters!  I guess I'll blame this all on the tabletop ancestor.  Devs:  it's fine to change the rules of your version, you do not have to adopt all the worst parts of a board game.  

Production values are good, art work is good, the plot line seems good...and yet the game mechanics are just atrocious.  What a boring, terrible experience.   Huge thumbs down unless you seriously love ORIGINAL D&D rules.  You know, the ones from before RPGs got polished.   Although, even D&D Online when it was a thing was not like this.

But with the content and complexities that come with pen and paper, some things just don't translate well when it comes to PC gaming, because the tutorial required for new players would have to be really extensive.

Apart from the strong upsides this game has there are some downsides.

1. Do you know anything about DnD? If not, then you will need to learn, as the games difficulty is catered to those that know a lot about it. Even myself having a general understanding of DnD and its mechanics I was taken back by just how much stuff the game presents to you. When you make a character often the game will suggest talents to spend that no player would ever suggest using. So you will make massive mistakes, so I would suggest using the NPC to allow respecs for mistakes you make, as you will make them often.

2. Wasted time on load screens/travel. At the start the game wont be too bad, but as you develop and settle your barony you will discover that the load screens will get tedious, while also having to travel with your character to do anything. Simple things like management of your barony to then check your chest, to then rest for a day, to then head to the town to sell stuff, will be tedious at best. Load screens for everything, and having to physically move your character to an exit each and every time you want to exit an area is tedious.

3. Why don't characters rest when you are skipping days? Don't know...

4. Often you will get lost, some things that a dungeon master can remedy when you are stuck, by providing extra helpful hits. But in the gaming world, there is no such thing, so you can often be left on your own devices, not knowing what to do. Some quests require you to encounter a random encounter, but the quest does not tell you this, so you can search multiple locations trying to find out what to do, and have to resort to the wiki and see what actually triggers the quest is not anything you thought it was.

Thank god they added turn basis fighting, because the game was unplayable till then.

UNTIL part 6 (after the Pitax stuff is resolved) where the game will fail you for mistakes you didn't know you were making 20 hours ago. I'm all for the games having harder elements to them that have effects the main game, but giving you a game over because you didn't build enough water towers half the game ago seems a bit to cruel. Also this is where the games difficulty goes up so high that it has an overhang. I got to a point where I had to downloaded a mod/save edit (with the help of my girlfriend because I have no coding skill) just to feel like I was on even footing with the enemies. Maybe I'm terrible at this kind of game but fighting outnumbered 30 to 1 getting constantly hit by stunning attacks I feel like perhaps its not my fault. Also how long do you think a stun attack should last? 3-5 seconds? How long to be annoying? 10-15 seconds? Yeah the stuns for the last bit of the game last 30-50 seconds! And they can stack! So cheating in order to give myself god like stats doesn't feel unwarranted.
That, titanic, complaint out of the way. I do still enjoy the rest of the game.

Pros
-the game has a fairly unique setting: it mostly takes place in a bunch of untamed regions that you slowly turn into your kingdom over the course of the game
-the companions are all interesting and well-written and have personal quests that give them a good amount of character development
-the roleplaying in this game is second-to-none, there are countless evil and good or chaotic and lawful decisions to be made
-on top of the CRPG gameplay, there's also a kingdom management element of the game- running your kingdom also involves a lot of decisions, further adding to the roleplaying aspect (alternatively, the kingdom management mode can be disabled if you don't want to bother with it)
-this game is the most faithful adaptation of a table-top rpg I have ever seen

Cons
-the gameplay can be slow and repetitive, the dungeons especially are way too vast and filled with dozens of the same encounter
-the developers are Russian and one character in particular talks like they just put their Russian dialogue in Google Translate and called it a day (I'm talking about Amiri. The rest of the companions talk in perfect English, for some reason)
-exploring all the locations on the map feels like a chore most of the time (sometimes there are worthwhile events or loot hidden in some random location, but most of the time it's just some enemies and mediocre loot)

Pros or Cons depending on your preferences
-this game is incredibly long
-compared to the sequel, where the story involves very high stakes and often revolves around big set pieces and cinematic moments, this game is more calm and grounded
-the game is very hard, especially towards the end
-this game involves a lot of reading

To summarize, exploring the map and exploring dungeons can feel like a chore in this game, but the roleplaying and decision-making more than make up for it.",1664279146,1664279146,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

BUT, it has some personal flaws that I have to deal with:
First the difficulty: I wish I could play this game in normal difficulty, but when I was 30 hours in, my will of beating hard battles on turn base mode was over. So much battles made me be bored of F5-Pause the game-Buff characters- go on the battle-maybe try a few times until I won and repeat for 20 times just in 1 quest. So even though turn based combat is better to learn your characters, I disable it and put Story-mode difficulty. WICH I REALLY RECOMEND to put Story-mode difficulty if you want to play this game in a relaxed-not-more-challenging game cause... even with that, just trying to complete everything on the game is exhausting.
Secondary the Kingdom management: that was a thing (that at the end was meaningfull but YOU HAVE to manage that well if you want to finish). The time limit of quests + the fact that your council is changing + the challenging CDs of your kingdom quest made it sooo overwelming, if you are worried just with normal quests, this made you reload 200 times until success happens because it worries so much to destroy your playthrough because of that. (And yes there's an option to automanage your kingdom but it is funny enough to do it yourself)
Last the time-limited quest and overwelming situations: Time-limited was a thing! I wish I could have all the time to complete the game properly, in my final 30-40 hours I just started to understand how the timing of the game work (Too late). DONT look for guides on the building mechanic, it really doesnt matter too much and is easier than you think, just read and do it at your passing. Also classes to choose on your main character and leveling up was a little painfull.

Why I do still recomend this game?? Despite of all that I said, I think there's gonna be people that want more challenge and understand properly the game and at the end IS AWESOME, or you just take a guide (even though I hate using them cause I think games shouldnt be so complicated that you need a guide to achieve what you want to achieve.

P.S.: Dont choose Paladin, if your alignment changes, you will not be able to cast any spell. I had to totally change my main character from Half Orc Paladin to Halfling Sorcerer at level 12.....

The characters are memorable somehow and will stay with you even afterward. The fights are awesome. The story feels awesome. I like the voice acting and the characters. Wish there was more voice acting but that's fine.

I also love the small things they've taken into consideration. For example, if you kill lots of bandits. You loot one corpse and it shows you the loot from all corpses nearby so you don't have to loot every single one. One-shot and you're done.


At the end of the level, it shows you all the loot lying around. You don't have to do the stupid thing in every other game - run all the way back to pick up that loot. No! Here, you get a list of items still lying on the level and you just grab whatever you want. This is what it means when devs actually care about the experience!

The closest that comes to this one is Dragon Age Origins.

The best thing is that can tweak every possible difficulty/interface to your own liking. Is there something that annoys you in the difficulty setting? Just switch that off or decrease the overall difficulty.

This itself is a step in the positive direction and I wish our whole gaming industry did this. Give the power to tweak the difficulty to the players so that each person may enjoy the game the way they want.

As for the quests - the characters tell you their story / what's happening and why they want you to do something. They plead with you and tell you their story. You'll really feel like helping them. Unlike other games where you're also emotionally involved in the quests and want to help them.

And once you've helped them they're grateful to you. And I mean not just ""thanks. here's 300xp"" like in other games. They'll actually take their family story a little forward so that you know you made a difference. More games need to do this.

I love how unique the characters are. That bard has a unique personality. I love how we could select the voice + tone for our hero. And I like that Amira woman's courage/strength. I liked the lore as well.

EDIT:

The game gets kinda boring later on. After 4-6 hours you start realizing that the loot sucks. I got some good gear in the beginning of the game and then after almost 30 hours of gaming. That tells you how sucky most of the loot is.

Map locations become difficult to manage later on. I wish all quests were highlighted on the map so that I could pan out more easily.

The number of advisors is very limited. I wish I could have more characters somehow so that I could assign them all various kinds of quests.",1631504715,1663899263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got it because I loved Pillars of Eternity, Deadfire, Divinity Original Sin 2, Tyranny, Spellforce and the DLCs, all really enjoyable RPG experiences with lovely characters and interesting story. I got this here as a recommended - and boy does it feel and play so much worse :/ 

It's not fun, it feels like doing math homework most of the time. Like, you watch characters walk somewhere - very slowly. And when it's not a walking sim, it's staring at loading screens. This thing had one for evey. single. tiny. map. part. What is it loading so long in these tiny maps? I have no idea. Random encounters on the road have longer loading before and after than the encounter itself lasts. And whats with the lack of voice acting? Even cutscenes often have only speech bubbles to read. Randomly a character has everything voiceacted, the next 10 have nothing? Waiting and reading is - at least - 70% of this game (without mods). 

Mods make this playable. Seriously, if you want to enjoy this, go to nexus and get some. Make your party walk faster. Fix carry weight, make your party tire and exhaust slower, or be prepared to spend half the time doing the same boring things like constantly resting, cause these guys can't walk for 4 hours straight without being tired and whining to you. Until they force you to rest. 

The story? Feels like a very very lazy random thing. You are some merc with no personality, no backstory, no nothing - randomly there. And they decide you get to be a ruler now. Because everybody else is kinda dead, which nobody cares about by the way. Your race or alignment or anything does not really matter, nobody comments or cares, your choices in character creation are meaningless for the story. Other random companions meet you for the first time and decide, yep, this random hobo here is now our best friend. And thats it. That's the story. Nobody is qualified to rule anything, nobody has any idea wtf they are doing. The game doesnt tell you what to do either, you run around randomly, missing stuff and companions it doesn't tell you about or give you any indication they are there at all - get a guide if you want to actually find stuff. 

The characters? Feel one dimensional and really generic. This is the generic violent dumb barbarian. This is the generic annoying happy bard. And so on. Like 2 or so of them actually have voice acting, the others you can read a ton of text for. And they have exactly 1 line for going down in battle, which you hear constantly. Other partymembers don't care if another dies. Even if they are supposedly lovers? Na, who gives a damn. Conversation choices are nonsense sometimes (example: you save 2 companions, invite them into your party, and the only option to exit the convo after they accept to come with you is: I hope I never see you again! Then they travel with you forver. Alright???) 

So... if you enjoy reading a LOT, if you enjoy walking around, if you love staring at loading screens, if you like learning the whole ruleset of this pnp before even making your character, this game is for you! Be prepared to give up your job tho, cause this takes TIME. Otherwise, I'd buy something else thats more fun.

- very long and nice story, although there are better games... including second pathfinder
- I enjoyed companions a lot more.
- lots of role playing opportunities and dialogues.
- mechanically very complex, which is a problem at first, later more enjoyable.
- game may by hard at the beginning, but it has good amount of difficulty options which I think could make game for anyone. I would recommend use turn based system - it makes things  much easier to learn. And generally I like turn based fights.

Problems:
- kingdom management - neither good or bad I guess, maybe a bit bad. I think game would benefit without. For anyone new I would suggest to get tips when this period starts, I felt really lost at first time.
- way to many meaningless locations... there is a fixed map set repeating over and over again offering just some inventory items. There was no pleasure IMO to visit them: easy battles (even if game is relatively hard), maps boring (repetitions), no interesting content... as general rule (there may be exceptions), if story does not lead to some location, its probably not interesting. It would be better to give those items to merchants if not on primary map.
- random encounters are used mostly to extend game length, not entertain. Whenever possible, avoid.
- still bit buggy

And about bugs I would urge to:
- Have checkpoint saves (beginning of chapter at the very extreme minimum, but I would do at the beginning/end of significant map).
- Save often and have 5-6 rotating saves at least.
Both save types are important, I had to repeat around 2-3 hours of gameplay, because at some point my save file was corrupted - but only one specific file for one map was damaged, so I was not aware of the issue.  I was saving game several times without knowing that each save is broken. Game started to crash when I returned to buggy location... I used checkpoint save and played a bit on story mode to catch up - took about 30 minutes, unfortunately due to a lot of scenes I could not skip.

After googling and reading reviews ""Is it worth playing PFK after PF WOTR"" I came to the conclusion that it does worth it.
Opinion: it does, but, rather, only for those who have completed the entire TES Skyrim (albeit with mods), including DLCs and side quests (sovocats, besides, obviously, were strongly inspired by this game):
in PFK, unlike PF WOTR, there is no such lamp-corridor storyline with optional locations - they literally throw you on the world map after the first act. This is not bad - but to go through it in such a way as not to lose interest - you still need to be able to (and whether your excessive curiosity will break your game / quests in the future is still a mystery).

The following pros and cons have been noted (I repeat - in the situation after the (quite pleasant and repeated) completion of WOTR):
- unpleasant bugs, incl. with party members and quests even after 3 years of patches - I'm sure / read that this game was simply impossible to play on release. At release, it was, with a high probability, a failed project. Thank you (apparently) that now - at least passable
- game design is implemented far from ideal: starting from the balance of the difficulty offered by the game and the death of characters with 35+AC under buffs with 10 reloads only (!) on the local Core (Complicated) at the beginning (!) of the game, the number of enemies at this and group-disposed things - and ending with just a QoL interface with little things
- sounds, partly music and almost all graphic assets migrated to WOTR. I was surprised how low-effort WOTR actually turned out to be: at the same time, the game was released 3 years after PFK
- there is no feeling of epicness, there is no fantasy epic in this game (in WOTR - there is, thanks to more powerful mystical forces everywhere and the description of them in the game itself): biorobots are fighting with biorobots for a place under the sun, a standard dark middle ages with a gray cardinal and this is it
- classes are more severely limited to well-known OP-builds (actually - the minimum for a comfortable game without reloads) in potential combination: only a few specific sets of builds work for high difficulties, not to mention solo-hard. In most cases, it is more practical to pump one pure class up to 20 lvl - especially for party members
- the design of optional locations is repeated much more often than in WOTR, with minor differences - which makes them a bit disappointing to explore
- you need to be able to go through such boring games so that it is NOT boring (without mods): at times it seems that the game is meditative and made with the aim of spending the evening watching loading screens and slow running (in WOTR - faster) characters in isometric view - then read a couple of text walls - and so fall asleep sitting
- kingdom-management in some kind of pre-conception state: cut and forget. At the same time, you can’t switch on auto: loss of significant gear and exp
- HOMM battles like in WOTR - not delivered yet
- a lot of money - there is nothing to buy and nowhere to buy
- the taste of the game appears (only!) somewhere after 14-15 lvl characters (skills and gear) - this is after more than half of the game. At 16 lvl and beyond - the game is just starting to bring proper pleasure (in WOTR starting from ~4-8th lvl)
- basically I go through the game without mods - perhaps the same mistake as trying to go through Skyrim without mods, even after 10 years. As an example: the game, after 3 years, can only offer ~15 portraits to choose from when creating a character. Half of them will turn out to be plot characters, but why do you need to know that, right?

+ interesting, at times, plot(s) and rp/dialogues - one of the main reasons for starting PFK
+ no critical inconveniences in the interface and/or gameplay after WOTR: do you want more PF? - here you go
+ there is loot, a lot of loot, different loot
+ 3 years the game repelled me by the decision of the developers to make time restrictions: an RPG with limited game time (days) to explore the world is a nightmare. It may have been fixed - they give 2 times more time than I spent on the thorough exploration
+ the last arc/location will recoup on you for all the fights that seemed ""boring"" to you even on the Normal difficulty level",1642165903,1663244473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Difficulty settings: When I first loaded up the game, I looked at the default difficulty settings, and I thought it was set to baby-tier journalist-mode, due to enemy crits being turned off and whatnot. So I set everything as close as I could to ""DnD by the book."" I then quickly realized that those settings were the way they were for a reason, since a level 2 - 3 party is expected to beat hordes of CR9 monsters. (Aside: if I presented those same encounters to my players at the tabletop, they would very rightly dump the entire bowl of Cheetos on my head.) So be warned, the difficulty can be very unbalanced, and usually not in your favor, so playing ""by the book"" will definitely have you save-scumming left and right if you're not thoroughly experienced with the game (this game specifically, not Pathfinder in general).

2. Dialogue options: This is my real problem with the game. The previous paragraph was a gripe, but this is something I consider a fundamental flaw, and the main reason I don't recommend the game in general. (Another aside: the underlying mechanical functionality of the game is great. The engine is beautiful and powerful. If Owlcat released a campaign editor built on this engine, I would buy it immediately, no questions asked.) There are almost zero Lawful Good dialogue options in the entire game. If you want to play a Paladin, you will basically be alternating between Lawful Neutral and Neutral Good options, and neither of those are typically anywhere close to Paladin-approved, morally and ethically. In fact, a fair number of the Lawful Neutral options feel downright Lawful Evil. Likewise, many of the Chaotic Good options feel closer to Chaotic Neutral - and crucially, the Chaotic Good option is often the least of several evils you are presented with. This leads me to two possible conclusions about how these choices were designed:
A. The designers view Lawful Good as a dysfunctional marriage of Law and Good, where the individual must carefully appease both sides without favoring one too much over the other. This is a very misguided and simplistic view of Lawful Good that is held by many DM's and players alike, especially if they've never really thought too hard about the deeper moral underpinnings of what any given alignment really means.
B. The designers are so morally bankrupt that they cannot fathom anyone wanting to be Lawful Good, and they probably have no grasp of the underlying ontology of the alignment system. The persistent anti-Law bias throughout indicates  they have an aversion to anything Lawful, and they cannot understand how something that is explicitly Lawful can also be explicitly Good. As such, they either actively chose to exclude Lawful Good options because they assumed no one would pick them (and are thus a waste of development resources)  or, more tragically, cannot fundamentally grasp a Lawful Good solution to any given situation because such a thing is anathema to their worldview.",1663081986,1663081986,False,1,1,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

Well, this game aims for the epic scope of the whole Mass Effect trilogy in one go, while adapting the complex Pathfinder rules set and adding a kingdom management system on top - brought to you by a small team with pretty much zero professional backup and only a crowdfunding campaign providing financial assets.
Yes, it is obvious in a lot of places that the team did punch above its weight pretty much. Quite some stuff is explained rather poorly and only makes sense in hindsight or when consulting a guide. If you go in blind, frustration will be waiting for you behind every corner in the beginning. But when Kingmaker works, when everything clicks into place and the big dramatic moments work as intended, it is truly glorious.
It's a shame really that the devs couldn't have it trimmed down to a level they might have had managed better, as Kingmaker had to stick to the RPG material it is based on, or this might have become a true classic of its time. 
Still, if you can get behind the premises, if you can forgive the flaws and inconsistencies and if you have some passion for all that RPG number crunching, Kingmaker can be an incredible experience.

Got several hours deep, realized I wasn't having any fun, and quit. Here's why!

- Incredibly bad RNG. Probably my own personal experience, but it was overwhelming. I had constantly struggled to roll above a 5 in combat while my opponents easily roll 15+. Awesome when you can't hit their AC of 10 but they're slaughtering your 21 AC tank. Making a Kineticist was a good choice, because the bevy of terrible rolls actually managed to hit sometimes, so I'd get to do something with at least 1 character. Sometimes. I had hoped that after about 10 hours it'd start evening out, but the incredible streak of 1-sided roll-battles didn't stop, so I decided to instead.
- The UI for selecting actions is frustrating: I'll attempt to use a potion on an ally and the user drinks it even though there's no benefit for them, instead of my Kineticist's simple blast being the default attack icon it selects to free action accept burn which is great design, and the finicky movement system ended up burning actions at a fairly regular rate (select a guy in range to attack, but lo, it decides to 5-foot step and cancel the attack, very cool). It's accessible, but it's not refined in a way that's friendly for new-comers to the isometric format. Everything feels clunky.
- Bugs! Which are wonderful. Sometimes I would randomly lose actions for no reason. My favorite was my character suddenly took 16 Dex damage, from what I assume was the monitor lizard poison they were afflicted with, within 1 round and died. That was pretty cool.

I love pathfinder, but the Divinity series has definitely figured out a more approachable and fun format from my perspective. I would suggest starting there before picking this up.",1662370597,1662370597,False,3,0,0.509531378746032715,0,True,False,False

Good choices matter game.  Pretty well fleshed out companions. Several romance options. Good, evil, idgaf options in dialogue and action.

I've seen complaints about the combat and ""Oh gosh you have to do SO much buffing and debuffing."" That didn't bother me, I liked the strategy aspect of it, and it is true to how Pathfinder is played on PnP.

I give this a solid 8.5/10. If you like RPGs with stories, consequences, good replayability, and deep character customization, I would reccomend.

It certainly deserves praise on many regards, especially as a developers' first, and for your money you're getting a massive sprawling story with mostly consistent quality; and, being a pretty faithful rendition of a big PnP game, you're getting a variety of character options and a depth of rules that dwarfs most other CRPGs. 

However, its many flaws are really hard to ignore, the main one being encounter design.
I'm a fan of CRPGs with slow, turn-based tactical combat, but the endless grind that the dungeons and quest instances in this game demand is insane. Having a dungeon be filled with literally dozens of nearly identical encounters, with the same enemy composition and no significant differences in environment layout, in a game where even the most trivial fight is bound to take at least a few minutes in turn-based mode, is just terrible design. The very first dungeon has you fight at least 20 encounters against centipedes and spiders; all pointless speedbumps fights where they barely scratch you, and the most they can accomplish even against a minimum level party is to consume a few of your spell slots. This is the very first dungeon and possibly the most egregious example, but almost every other quest instance will follow the same formula: the exact same fight repeated over and over and over again, with maybe two or three interesting encounters sprinkled in for variety.
In this sense, Kingmaker is really a faithful rendition of DnD/PF campaigns, including the bad parts - like bad DM that follow the terrible advice of throwing pointless encounters at their party just to waste their resources; and even if it's mercifully not as slow as it would be in real life, it's still just not respectful of the players' time. 
There's also the fact that plenty of encounters are just designed to require you to reload and buff yourself appropriately, by having some extremely annoying spells or rules in play that will require a very specific buff to be circumvented. For example, there's a quest location where you'll be constantly ambushed by invisible enemies appearing out of thin air, getting a surprise round on you, and blasting your party with a certain elemental AOE spell in the surprise round. At that level, that initial barrage is perfectly capable of one-shotting your main character, even if it's a very bulky fighter (as was my case). But if you already know what's gonna happen, you can just cast some communal energy protection/resistence against that element, and the fights become trivial. 
That's just not good encounter design. The game encourages you to save often, but guess what would make for a better experience? Encounters that don't require prescient buffing to be solved at all, and a game that doesn't encourage save scumming. 

And speaking of 'faithful renditions of the bad parts', while the writing and story are largely enjoyable, there's also a number of quests and story moments that are just frustrating; for example, story moments where the game wants you to feel bad because innocent people died because of your action, except you didn't get a choice in those actions (and your big stash of resurrection spells and scrolls is conveniently unavailable); or dialogue choices where all the options are terrible and/or out of alignment for your character; or the infamous hellknight questline.
In fairness, the game does a pretty good job at giving you freedom of choice over many situations that can have fairly different outcomes, and at having these choices come back again much later in the story. Unfortunately, the bad parts stick out sorely.

Finally, I've seen that the kingdom management section of the game is a bit divisive among players; I personally have enjoyed it overall, but some parts of it are really frustrating. The DC of the advisor checks take a sudden spike at a certain point of the game, for example, and that can be really frustrating.
Another frustrating aspect for me has been the advisors availability. Trying to avoid spoilers, let's just say that one of your initial advisors won't be around forever, and others will become unavailable for certain stretches of the game. That isn't so bad in itself, but also, two of your potential advisors are 'optional' characters that can only be recruited during a certain act of the game, and some of the characters have just really bad stats for some of the roles they can cover. This isn't necessarily terrible, but in my specific case, I managed to miss both optional characters, and the combination of all these factors meant I had to scramble for advisors, make mercenaries specifically to cover certain roles (with a hefty penalty to checks because of that), and still be left with several advisors that were either sub-par or a terrible match for my supposedly Good-aligned kingdom. 
And sure, missing characters was my fault, but the ease with which they can be missed is kind of a problem in and by itself. Both characters are available only in a specific stretch of time, and only by visiting certain locations on the map; however, if you like me enjoy exploring when you have the chance, you may very well have visited those locations before the characters became available; and after that you are given no reason or clue to revisit them. So you end up missing characters not because you explored too little, but because the game didn't account for you exploring too much too soon. And the game does pressure you to finish quests as soon as possible, since they're all time-sensitive (and some with secret timers), and for the very same reason it is sensible to explore whenever you have some downtime between quests.

In conclusion, I spent 200 hours on this game and I mostly had a good time, but I can't earnestly recommend it to anyone knowing that more than half that time was wasted on repetitive, uninteresting fights, and the remaining half was still riddled with occasional frustration. There is a lot of value here and a lot to praise, but also plenty of flaws; and if a game that is mostly about time-intensive tactical combat has 10+ repetitive speedbump fights surrounding every occasional interesting fight, that game is just not respectful of your time.",1662218270,1662218270,False,64,0,0.785892128944396973,0,True,False,False

Decent creative exercise shows off the pathfinder system really well.  The best part is the really wide variety of character options forming a delightfully complex character creation system.  Its integrated with a civ like city building system that is interesting at least, basically a combination of baldurs gate 2 and sim city.

It adds a crazy amount of classes.  The build options are nearly infinite and even though I'm early on I've already seen things I'd do differently in a second playthrough.  

Quick example- my party consists of an Elven Sword Saint, a Fighter/Mage Hybrid who is an expert with the Rapier, A Psychic Investigator who excels at dual-wielding sickles and uses mind-attacks, An Elven Wizard who is super-specialized in Evocation- so spells like Magic Missile, Fire Ray, Magma Orb are given crazy-high bonuses plus she has a magic tattoo that boosts those spells an extra level.  Also have a Bard, Pure Cleric, a more combat-oriented Cleric-hybrid.... a few more.  But you get the point.  

If you enjoy micromanaging your character builds and multiclassing with nearly infinite options:  Kingmaker plus Call of the Wild might be something you'd like.  Also- time is taken into account.  Remember in Deus Ex: Human Revolution where you get called to the office and are told you need to solve a hostage situation.... and you ignored that because more RPGs do.... only to find out that all your screwing around led to some hostages getting murdered- this game has similar situations.  

The combat is old-school DnD- it's along the lines of Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate, Divinity: OS (to a degree, Divinity is a bit of a different deal).  Would also recommend a mod that increases the level cap (because it appears there are 2 extra campaigns after you finish the main game.  not POSITIVE on that but there were 3 listed campaigns I could choose from in the beginning) and maybe the Bag of Tricks mod.  Not to give yourself 100000 Gold or instantly level up- but more because you can screw yourself badly during your learning curve so I just used it to tweak minor things so I didn't feel the need to restart.  Specifically I didn't fill out my early party with mercs and it screwed me badly later, so I added a little cash to hire them at higher levels so I didn't have to restart to hire them at level 1.

I can say with confidence that Kingmaker is...mind grindly annoying without mods, but very enjoyable once tweaked to your tastes. I would not recommend the former but highly recommend the latter. 

Now then... 

The Base Game borders on ""bad"" for several reasons. 

First: The Kingdom Management System. Having played the actual modules myself I can tell you this has not survived translation from tabletop to video game - it's played way too literally and you can never feel connected to what you do or the choices you make - it's just rubbish. You can very easily sink 30-40 hours into this game and just lose because you missed a character or a set-event happens that causes everyone to riot; sometimes it's literally down to just RNG or the game going ""I'm going to make sorting this out so difficult you literally only have a 1 in 20 chance."" Finally you can end up causing your advisers to straight up walk off if you don't understand the alignment system and pick the ""wrong"" option for that adviser. 

Second: The Pacing. The first part of the game (prior to becoming a Barron) is fun; you feel like you're on an adventure - and the game wants to encourage you to explore around, solve a mystery and just generally take in the world and meet the characters. However the moment you have your Kingdom, the mechanics of the game suddenly shift against you going out and well...adventuring. If this was intentional by Owlcat to make you feel the ""Burden"" of Leadership then its spot on, well done. Regardless it's not fun at all. You fell like you are being punished for wanting to go do fun stuff (like fight monsters, solve puzzles and get loot) rather than civic administration. Especially in an initial play-through you'll find yourself missing events, mistiming them as you wander around; or just straight up get ganked by wandering into an area you weren't suppose to. The Camping mechanic is also fun...the first few times. But then quickly becomes this irritating thing. For tabletop players who track stuff like fatigue and rations it's probably a real dream; but for some it may be annoying. 

Third is the event and quest triggering: You can, without knowing it, miss quests and events because you explore too much - indeed a very very common thing in many playthroughs is that players miss a key character (Jubilost) because he spawns in a very tight time window in an area you may have already been through (and hence have no interest or awareness you should be heading back there). There's also several points where you are just wandering around waiting for something to trigger which can lead to feeling a little lost sometimes. This is great as it encourages multiple playthroughs to see everything, but on initial playthroughs you can get irritated that you miss so much simply because you didn't know.

Finally it's the overall weakness of 3.X as a ruleset. Some of the mechanics feel clunky (like inventory management and gearing), especially around the kingdom manager (you are forced to skip 2 weeks of time as you sort certain event's out which can cause failure or just spiral your kingdom to falling apart). In particular, for those that don't know; the power creep in D&D 3.0/3.5 and PF is insane. My personal opinion is that it works best between levels 1-7, after that, without a careful hand by both player and DM, the game can literally spiral into a balance nightmare - where either you are invincible or the enemies kill you in a couple of strikes. This happens in Kingmaker quite quickly and unless you understand the ""Meta"" elements of the core mechanics and how to build you characters - you will quickly find yourself hating how overpowered or useless you and the characters are.  

And then you discover the range of mods for the game; and all of a sudden you can tweak the game to either outright fix some of the problems (like kingdom manager) or mitigate them enough that they become background gripes rather than in your-face-annoyances (e.g, Travel time an camping rations). Extra Classes, tweaks and changes to characters, the option to play everything from ""full power gaming"" to ""Low Fantasy-Crawler"" or just outright become one-punch man. You can find and do anything with the game with mods and immediately it becomes a highly recommended game everyone should try.",1661728275,1661728347,True,29,2,0.763004481792449951,0,True,False,False

Cons: Kingdom management is tedious and actively gets in the way of your early/mid game experience - recommend getting the mod that lets you kingdom manage remotely so you're not constantly backtracking and interrupting exploring and advancing the story.

Dialogue choices try to push you in certain directions sometimes that can put you at odds between what your character alignment should do and what you as a player might enjoy a different resolution with a different interpretation of your alignment. (Only a gripe for heavy roleplayers - it's all very set in stone basically)

Minor annoyance: True ending is an absolute pain to unlock, one dialogue mistake anywhere between the start of the game to near the end and you're locked out of it and you don't find that out until the very end of the game.

Now, you may note that is quite a lot of time to be fighting the same enemy. Did the enemy have too much health? No. Statistically speaking I should've had the thing dead in 10 rounds tops assuming the worst of luck. Hypothetically a single crit from my barbarian would have one shot the thing (note a critical is a 1/20 chance and I did not roll a single crit in that entire 5 hour period in which I made more than likely hundreds of attack rolls, meaning my chance of never rolling a crit in that time is astronomically low). Did the enemy do too much damage? No. My 3 warriors had 30-40 health each and an average attack did about 4 damage. So why couldn't I beat it? Because in spite of the fact that I SHOULD have been hitting the enemy about 30-40% of the time according to its armor class and my attack bonuses, however in practice I was hitting this enemy approximately 1% of the time. The fact that this persisted FOR FIVE AGONIZING HOURS is a testament to my borderline unlimited persistence, I kept thinking ""Statistically speaking, this is borderline impossible and one of these times I should kill this enemy easily like I statistically should be doing"" but it never happened, and now it's never going to because I am never playing this again.

There are millions of possible character-builds, and hundreres of hours of gameplay with endless encounters and quest. Unfortunatly, there's not a lot of fun to be had. 

There is not at lot of actual gamedesign to be found in this game, it's mostly just content stack haphazardly on top of each other. The combat is very boring, most of the encounters are simply just a bunch on enemies spawned in at one side of a flat field, and you at the other side. There are almost never any use of tactics, despite some timing with spells and abilities, so the combat seems to mostly be determined by how optimized your party is versus how hard you set the difficulty.

The writing, however, isn't bad, so the storyline and NPCs might hit you, where it missed me. The combat is real-time and pretty quick, so you might enjoy it, if the tactics aren't important to you, and you just enjoy seeing your enemies get chopped to pieces while clicking on a spell and watching nobody gets to close to death. If you liked the combat in the old infinity engine games, you'll probably also like it here.

This might be for you, if you mostly just want lots of system and rules and choices and endless combat against more or less random enemies in a field, and don't care too much about how well-balanced and deeply-designed these experiences are, you'll get a lot of content for your money.

I, however, just felt like I wasted my time.

It's still awkward and poorly paced and unsatisfying. You can feel this most with the late game. There is a lot of value here, but its staggered by massive drops in quality that just kill momentum and investment. There are too many copy paste dungeons, filler combat, and just... loads of slog. You should only play this being prepared for these pot holes, and ready to slog through Pathfinder's mechanics if you haven't already mastered them. Mods do make this game better, more flexible, more customizable. The most unsatisying thing about the end game is [spoiler] you have to romance Nyrissa to be allowed to kill the big bad. It's stupid that they try and force you to be sympathetic to her as it is, but to also be rail roaded into romancing her if you want a satisfying conclusion is just gross. They could have made a shorter, better game, but had to just add filler. This is painfully obvious in the end game where they reuse just about every area and boss. And the penultimate dungeon is literally copy pasted so you have to do it twice. By the end game I am so painfully bored of the combat that normally I really enjoy, its just so over used and tedious and repetitive and lazy of the developers. I hate it, and its a shame because its so close to being a great game, and it was within their resources to make a better game, but just misguided game design philosophy led them to value play time over quality.

The game has a really good fondation and universe. But it is frustrating. Down to the point I seriously think of dropping it.

If you even set ennemies in ""SOMEWHAT thougher"" you'll end up watching blind mentally deficient poeple equipped with pool noodles in a medieval martial art tournament. Even with all the buff you have active, your team will hit one time out of ten while ennemies never miss unless their attacking your tankiest guy with a tower shield. 

It's not that the fights have complicated mechanics, or clever ennemies or anything. Just the game actively refuse that you hit the ennemy. 

But aside of that, the real problem is the kingdom management. First, you have much to explore and do on your land and the further you go, the harder it becomes to come back to your city every month. Second, your adviser. You never have enough of them. you always have more issue on your hand than you can solve since everyone of your adviser can handle one task at a time, usually in weeks. And then, unrest build. Oh trust me, you'll see the unrest goes up. And for what ? Aside of the risk of your kingdom collapsing and your game to be over, you have nothing to game.

I recommend using builds from the internet to have stronger companions, or just lowering the difficulty, just so combats at least become quicker. Still, SO MUCH combat... argh...

--- Previous review---

In short, the game crashes (gamer breaking, beginning of act 2) and customer service is hard to find and does not respond. So if you are willing to take a chance and buy this game and maybe not be able to play it through, without the developers seeming to care, go ahead.
But I cannot recommend it.

This is not a bug that makes a side quest fail or a mechanic work incorrectly or whatever - this ends the game after act 1.

To go into detail, I started the game and enjoyed act 1.
However, at the very beginning of Act 2, a specific action causes it to crash (CTD) systematically (specifically, that action is the first kingdom expansion advisor mission : claiming the outskirts).

I have tried contacting customer support, which is a hassle in itself. None of the steam links to this game (customer service link included) lead to a contact page : they all lead either to the product sales page or a community forum.
I eventually found a contact link for paizo and contacted them, but received no response. I have contacted them a second time and await. Hopefully this gets resolved and I can change my recommendation.

The game itself adapts the mechanics of the TTRPG of the same name. They managed to do it pretty neatly, but they forgot to include any tutorial or codex with explanations of the deeper systems. This is not a problem in lower difficulties, since you are just pressing attack, but on highers you will need deep uinderstanding of the mechanics, which will require a lot of forum reading. This makes the new player expereince terrible, since you will have no idea what does what. Even in lower difficulties, there are some issues from it, for exaple, there are a lot of items, which does not stack together (e.g. bracers of armor with armors) but the game does not tell you these. You will either notice, or not. And this issue goes to character creation too. There are a lot of differet types, other then the well knwon base types, so you will have a hard time foguring out what does what. For exaple, i have still no idea, what does scroll savant wizard do.
The inventory management is really bad in this game. I understand why the put a weight limit to the game, but this results in, you have to run back muiltiple times to vendors, to sell stuff, from exploration and dungeons. Which takes time, which you do not have much. And vendors are always in impossibly far away.
And there are some places, where you can't return for that loot. But you need money, you need a lot in this game, because kingdom management burns up a lot.
There are really nicely crafted dungeons, with a lot of puzzles and secrets, but the issue is, sometimes it is really hard to find the hints you need.  Also, some story dungeons are terrbile (looking at you Vordakai and end game dungeon).
The difficulty curves are another problem here. Usually, it can be done, but there are some bosses, encounters (mostly optional), where you bleed out your eyes to do that, and they will always require some special spell/ability to defeat, that you do not even know it exists. (Tutorials, codex PLS)
The premade characters, well they are bad. The party you can make from them, is not too balanced. And one of them is not even healable with normal heal spells. So if you want to play on higher difficulties, you will need a custom made party.
And there are the crowd control effects. They stay on your characters after the fights. And there is no option to turn this on. What does this gave us? 20 real time minute of waiting, so my characters get out of being frozen. And waiting for minutes, just so the pit spells disappear.

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
Same as graphics. My biggest problem with here is that not everything is voice acted. Not even the main story. Just parts of it, small parts. It breaks your immersion in the game. At least, if you include voice acting, voice all the main story aynd companion quests please.

This is another strong point. Your decisions form the ending of the game to some extent. And it is worth it to replay, for the different outcomes.

DC's can be high on certain traps and such, the game does require you to know what you're doing build-wise, and some of the companions have sub-optimal builds unless you use mods like Call of the Wild (highly recommend this mod, as it adds a lot more classes and archetypes from the TTRPG, and specs your companions into more thematic choices, Harrim -> Warpriest, Octavia -> Exploiter Wizard). But otherwise the game isn't too terrible difficulty-wise if you know what you're doing and are a veteran to the CRPG genre. Baldur's Gate, and Neverwinter Nights are both much more unforgiving. If you aren't too familiar with CRPGs, the difficulty slider is there, and pre-built options exist for builds until you get comfortable with how building characters works (It's a lot more in-depth than D&D-based engines, because Pathfinder itself is more in-depth, but this allows for great flexibility in builds.)

It's clear that the Devs put a lot of time and care into the game just based on the sheer scope of systems and details. Every corner is filled with lore and the amount of content is massive. The choose your own adventure style sections with skill checks are a very nice addition.

BUT, the game is incomplete.

There are bugs and glitches, interactions that don't make sense with gear stats. Turns getting skipped because an interactions that failed to complete properly. The game is full of these and it's clear there was not enough bug testing involved. Even if you can ignore these and still enjoy the game, you'll be cruelly slapped in the face with a game breaking error. 

There is an instance late in the game with a kingdom event that will continue to reoccur until you finish a quest except the trigger to stop this event is broken. Worse yet is that even if you succeed with the event, the stat bonuses are incorrectly attributed and will cause a massive reduction until your kingdom is destroyed. This is a main story quest that you can not avoid. If you want to continue with the game you need to go into the options and shut the entire kingdom mode down. 

This is a sizeable chunk of the story in the game that just implodes 4/5 of the way in. You could still play the game and ignore this aspect, but if you spent the game trying to get immersed in the world and then just had a big chunk blow up in your face it's hard to care about it anymore.

With the kingdom management turned on (by default), I felt like I was being forced to focus exclusively on that and wasn't able to freely explore the map and actually adventure with my party.  I was aware of the kingdom management elements, but assumed they would be less the main focus of the game after the first section and more of a 'do this quest to upgrade your castle' or 'use the management interface to unlock this quest' (like Dragon Age Inquisition, which I loved).
After turning the kingdom management off (setting it to Automatic and not allowing it to fail and give me a game over, which is honestly ridiculous that it can do that in the first place in a CRPG), I found that I really had nowhere to go that wasn't too high level for my party (level 11-18 monsters when I was at level 6, for example).
Also, I am a veteran player of the Pathfinder RPG, but anyone who is not familiar with the game system would absolutely need to read a guide explaining the basic concepts (AC, bonuses and penalties to hit, the action economy, skills, feat chains, archetypes, etc.), so this requires much more commitment to learning the system than a game like DOS2.  And, just like in the tabletop game, most progression beyond level 6 or so is just in raising your attack / armor bonuses so that you can actually survive the endlessly escalating enemy stats.
In the end, I may come back to this some day if I get bored, but I wish the devs had chosen whether they wanted this to be a CRPG (which I would have loved) or a kingdom sim game (which would not have interested me).",1659844264,1659844264,False,0,0,0.498346388339996338,0,True,False,False

However, that was mostly in the Rouge-lite. If that is your thing, along with this kind of tactical RPG game play, then by all means, try it out. It regularly goes on sale for under $9.

However, the campaign is a mess. The dev's idea of what alignments act like, and what constitutes good and evil, is bizarre as often as not. As is the various character's reactions. If you choose an act that's on the ass opposite end of the alignment spectrum from another character, that character should not cheer you on!

The over arching narrative is actually quite good. This is a problem. it's compelling enough to drag you along, but the game itself gets worse and worse. And it's  L O N G ! It's turned into a real slog, but I feel compelled to see how the rest unfolds. Had I know so much of the game would piss me off, I'd never have started.

The game is buggy with crashes and just weird things. Quests are broken. Saves get bloated to a ridiculous degree. I'm on chapter 5 of 8 and my saves are around 65MB each. By comparison, my end-game saves for Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 are under 3MB, and I played those to completion.

Thinking of PoE, this game really just makes me wish I was playing those again. They are better in every way save for their lack of turn-based and proper controller support. However, the second game does have turn-based, and the UI is well designed. Since it can be controlled through the keyboard, setting up controller bindings for PoE isn't terribly difficult.

Thinking of UI, the interface in Kingmaker is terrible. It is horribly cluttered. I'm level 16 and I spend more time hunting for skills and spells to use than actually using them. For better or worse, i stopped bothering, instead relying on the OP at-will abilities Cloud and Deadly Earth. Those two trivialize fights. They may as well give me a button that says ""kill everything on the map without actually doing anything"". I want to respec, but then I remember that I just want to get this over with.

The combat is fun at first, but it gets dull and the bugs have really gotten to me. If combat was the game play, that wouldn't be entirely terrible. But where I am in the game, I'm mostly just clicking ""skip day"" and assigning people to solve problems for me. Then waiting to see the result. And hoping something interesting happens so I can stop just skipping time.

For this to be a good game, they'd need to either fix the bugs or condense the story. But seeing as how they are about to release the sequel's last DLC, I can't imagine any changes ever coming to this game.

edit: I have since finish this game. I regret the time I spent between my initial review and this moment. The campaign is easily the worst I've played in this genre. Everything being on a timer, and the inability to simply click ""skip until something interesting happens"" really drags this out and by the end of the game I was just spamming a single ability (Deadly Earth).

Updated: 
So, as a glutton for punishment (I never did find out why this game was so harsh on my last PC) I came back. Luckily, the problem did NOT return...at least not to my knowledge....yet.....

Happily say this game is an utter joy to play, and from someone who was neck deep in D&D games from the late 90s to early 2000s, this Game REALLY does a great job of capturing that ""feel"" like Icewind and Baldur's.
I'm likely to buy the DLC once I've finished ( I restarted cause I'd been away for so long, so I'm 17 hours in, and hammering away at this game's Story and character side quests.

Solid Dialog, with wonderful voice actors that while sometimes can feel ""cheesey,"" it's the right type, and amount so it's all good baby. Graphics aren't crazy, but the particle effects and spells work nicely making the lower Text quality characters, and monsters less of a ""missed chance"". The art is fantastic, and music although feeling ""lack luster"" still manages from time to time to give atmosphere and substance. 

This game has some REAL solid ground to work with, and I don't need to get more indepth than I have to give you my final say. At full price even this game would be a Yes. But with it's age, hopefully bundled with the new DLC you can get it at a deal and dive into a VERY fleshed out FUN game that has just enough of everything to give you something...while still knowing there's more to be done, with plenty of growth possible. And with it's following almost certainly going to happen.

Here we command a squad of maximum 6 characters, wandering a relatively-open world, solving the quests and fighting the enemies. All this built on the top of famous D&D rules, which comes with turn-based combat and a large variety of races, classes, spells and perks.

Combat has been implemented quite well. It is interesting and challenging. Careful preparations and correct tactics are often necessary for the win. 

In order to rest to restore spells and abilities, we need to set up a camp, distributing party members between different tasks: hunting, cooking, nightwatch and so on.

Most of the battles are fair-balanced: you’ll lose if you rush into a battle without thinking, but you do not need to spend hours searching for the exact correct tactics either.

Besides the common RPG gameplay, we need to govern the barony/kingdom, making strategic decisions about its further advancement, like establishing new settlements, building new city constructions, choosing financial strategy and so on. Sounds good in theory, but has been implemented quite badly in practice.
First of all, it all depends on randomness. Each time we assign an advisor to the particular task, it has some chance of success. Thus in the end the flourishing of our kingdom is just the matter of luck. After several assignments are completed your kingdom may become extremely rich or reduce to ashes, depending on how the dice rolls. We can increase chances of success for the particular task using “crisis points”, but they are always scarce. 
We can improve the effectiveness of the particular department by completing special assignments or investments. Nevertheless, close to the game’s end I often find myself in a situation, when chances of the success of a new government task equals zero…
Another crucial problem is the fact that kingdom flourishing is a crucial part of the game pass-through. If you can not manage the governing, the kingdom will fall apart and the game will be over. Also there are some story events, like plague spreading among citizens, foreign saboteurs attacks and so on, which should be dealt with asap, otherwise the kingdom will fall. But to deal with those events, you should roll the dice…
The only good thing about this kingdom management is that it can be set to “automatic” at the game settings. In such a way, our country will not achieve any greatness, but will not fall apart either.

The main story is not quite interesting. We are committed to clear out the land from the bandits in order to rule it. The whole idea appears quite absurd: why does the mighty kingdom hire mere mercenaries to deal with a bunch of bandits, and then pay them using the land they have freed? The game attempts to justify this inconsistency via some twisted political situation, like: “this is a border land”, “we can not conquer directly, but can gain you as an ally” and so on. It is actually quite intriguing at the beginning. I was preparing to deal with plots, politics, treachery and the war between the neighboring states, but unfortunately the story goes quite in a different direction. We find ourselves dealing with the ancient curse fabricated but god-like entities from the other dimension, which is quite unremarkable. The only thing, which makes this look more or less “fresh” is the fact, we are fighting not demons but capricious creatures of pure magic - fairies. Thus the fighting area is not an abyss, but magic gardens.

We could use a better journal and quest marking in the game. You can often find yourself in a situation, when you can find the location you need to travel to solve the quest. And it is not like I am saying that the game should “hold your hand” along the way - no, it is about simple logging. For example: we have just talked to NPC, who says we should travel to a camp in the wilderness to find our goal. Fine, now, at which “wilderness”? To the north or to the east or to the west? Some crucial parts are not said, some simply do not appear in the journal or on the world map.

Also several times during the main quest we encounter the situation, when the actual goal is unclear, like “you need to find the enemy agent’s camp”, without any hint at which part of the country you should look for it. It makes you scout every corner of the world map for weeks or even months (of the game internal time that is). It would not be a big problem by itself, but alongside such quests there is always a global event, which ruins your kingdom while you make your search.

Also the final stage of the main quest is too protracted: we spend many hours cutting our path through several bunches of really tough enemies, making progress to the story’s end too long and boring.

Side quests and companions’ quests have been done well enough. We are often given different ways to solve the particular task.

The characters' personalities could be done better. At the first glance we have a good diversity of interesting persons: a warrior fled from becoming a paladin, a noble priest, a meticulous scientist, a pair of run-away slaves and so on. But some details about them often do not fit. For example: Harrim praises the end of the world and seems indifferent whether he will live or die. Is that supposed to be a reliable fighting companion? Octavia is a run-away slave, but takes a lot of effots to appear pretty, like picking cosmetics, change a haircut and so on. Do the slaves actually care about how they look like?
 
Graphic is basic. Can’t say it is bad, can’t say it is good or realistic. For the game, which main feature is tactical battles shown from the height, it is acceptable.
However, most of the world's areas have been created using the good old “copy-paste” approach. Thus the different locations often look alike.

Optimization could be better though. Sometimes the game lags, especially when several different combat effects are applied.

The main disappointment are the visuals for the dialogue and cutscenes. They could be done much better. It is not necessary to create high-detailed cinematics, but at least some basic animations could be added, so we can evaluate the event not only by its text description.

Same comes for the dialogs. It could use a close camera and at least basic gesticulation. This way dialogs would appear much better.

Of course, you can say “this is a classic approach”, but back in the times of “classic” games creating such things were complex, and digitalization of characters was not good enough. Nowadays, with the modern technologies and 3D engines, those should not be a problem.

Another problem with appealing to the “classics” are the text quests, like “You have reached the fork: 1. Go to the left. 2. Go to the right”. Seriously? It simply appears like a cheap implementation for me.
Why not create at least some basic visualization for it?

Music is unremarkable, but suits the gameplay well enough.

Overall it is 6-7/10. If you are a fan of D&D games, you will probably enjoy this one. But there are too many things, which spoils the overall impression.

-Travel times and permanent fatigue from needing to rest CONSTANTLY are core to this turd of a game. You will waste huge amounts of time with traveling and your characters constantly saying ""we need to rest"". 
-Encumbrance is also central to this game. why? these aspects are always ignored in every pen and paper game I have been in because its tedious and annoying.
-The game is built around the need for save scumming. There is NO WAY to flee a combat that you cannot win. You must reload your last game. The DCs for every skill check and trap disarm are UNREAL high for a level 2. The DCs are in the high teens. I would punch a DM in the face if they kept throwing DC 19 traps or a 21 lock pick at a level 2 character. This game devolved into saving before and after every mouse click.
-There is no game balance whatsoever. As a level 2 you will have to fight things significantly more powerful than you are where you must roll a 20 to even hit. The dice are clearly bugged as your characters will very rarely roll over 10.

Very little in the way of tutorial or explanation as to how Pathfinder actually works as a game system, so either go out and buy the books or constantly tab out to google

Lots of bugs (UI errors, AI errors, Combat errors, the game forgetting characters feats and abilities) but also...

Bad game design. As an example, if you can't save during combat to prevent save scumming, why is combat little more than wave after wave of the same enemy? You'll run out of the limited spells and abilities you have very quickly, but be punished for dying by being sent back to save before the combat, sometimes tens of minutes ago. Resting is also discouraged as it progresses time in the overworld meaning you're more likely to miss key events for kingdom management. So if you can't save scum, you can't use unlimited abilities, and you can't rest to get more... what do you do? Is the point to just fail? The sheer number of mobs you'll face, and the frequency of which your plans mean nothing (due to an unexplained combat system which sees your miss attacks 75% of the time) lead to a very dissatisfying experience, and one that I just can't imagine the developers intended.

Unless they did. In which case fuck me for playing their game then I guess?

Even if you come experienced from D&D CRPG, you'll be punished even at normal difficulty for not knowing the game intricacies, like that direct hit with weapons can't hit swarms etc. There is no hint of this in the game itself, even in the in-game encyclopedia, which makes it somewhat a chore to chew through the first act of the game unprepared.

But if you give it patience and let go of your ego to look up guides... then it's an absolutely great experience! I was somewhat worried about the 40GB size of the game compared to Pillars of Eternity 2's 52GB but considering the latter is 2.5D fully drawn maps compared to this game's fully 3D maps then it is probably safe to say that this game is somewhat larger in scope. Plenty of adventuring ahead.

Said choice of graphics engine makes it also very visually beautiful at times, especially the lighting. I am only in the latter of first act (after making a handful of failed builds) yet I've seen bright lush forests, warm halls lit with candles, spooky hollows etc.

There is also a clear emphasis on the adventuring aspect of the game. Whereas in D&D games, camping was merely a click-o-heal tool, it is here a dangerous yet necessary undertaking when exploring the wilds with your party. Having a balanced team each with specialties in passive skills is needed to not only not starve but also hiding the camp from possible attackers, cooking a meal, and keeping watch. All these are diced rolls which can fail and wake your party up in the middle of the night to nasty surprises. You are rewarded with companion banter at the campfire after a good day's adventuring though!

This game is a definite but cautious recommend, but ONLY if you are prepared to make some preparations outside the game to delve into this world. Reading up on guides is the first step.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

The game as a whole is fairly good, but has some problems, mainly stemming from bugs. The mouse cursor will constantly freeze, turn-based combat can glitch out (fixing it will skip a party member's turn more often than not), and the 2nd to last dungeon has terrible performance and bugs that can either force a reload or lock you out of a party member. 

For my personal gripes, I played a sage sorcerer necromancer build. Unfortunately for me, nearly ALL bosses in this game are immune to ""death magic"", except the final boss oddly enough. This does not only include instant kill spells, but many necromancy spells that simply do damage. 

As for the good, most characters are interesting enough. Nok-Nok and Regongar were my favorites, who made wonderful companions to my lawful evil necromancer. Amiri and her culture are pretty interesting, if not a tad pedestrian. Her biggest flaw is that she can't be romanced. Jaethal is a bit too one note in personality, her whole bit is just being evil. Everyone else is alright, except one. 

Linzi. Fuck Linzi. Chaotic good little shit that is the clear OC of one of the devs. She can't die by your hand, you can't tell her to piss off, and she's there until the end no matter what. The game even strong-arms your character into ""caring"" about her, even if your actions are entirely different. Worst yet, at the end of the game, you don't even get the pleasure of killing her yourself. She dies and lives forever inside your journal, and you have to give a ""tearful goodbye"" to this halfing vermin that's been nesting in the walls of your kingdom for years. The most you can do to her is turn her homeland into an absolute dystopia as punishment, which is fine, but seems like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Then there's the Darvin chapter. It's well known that the Darvin chapter was put in because a money whale sank a lot of dosh into the funding of the game, and got his DeviantArt OC put into the game with his own questline. The guy literally does the ""Teleports behind you, nothing personnel kid"" attack for God's sake. Even worse, if you want to tell this absolute trouser stain to get lost and join his enemies, the process of doing so is needlessly complex and requires extremely specific actions and probably multiple reloads, if it is actually possible. Unlike Linzi though, once he's gone, he's gone. Turn his village to the ground, and move on. 

Gameplay wise, its good. Kingdom management is workable, but I didn't really understand it. Combat, when it works, feels great. Most issues you'd have in the game when it comes to combat are at the very beginning, and at the very end. Enemies with 30 AC when you're level 2 hiding in an area you go to very early on, and in the lategame, the Wild Hunt enemies. Ho-lee-shit. At the end of every round, each Wild Hunt type enemy will force a will-save on your entire party, or they'll be paralyzed for 30 seconds. As far as I can tell, this stacks. So if you're like me and love having your goblin jester around, the poor boi will just be useless in the final two dungeons if they're around. 

Overall, I'd recommend the game to anyone whose a fan of TTRPGs. The bad segments that bookend the game are short, with the vast majority of the game being fun.

Pathfinder Kingmaker is based on the Pathfinder tabletop, which is based on D&D 3.5 ruleset, with a few adjustment and its own world. Kingmaker is an established campaign for this ruleset and world. In this regard, the game works... the rules are familiar and work, after all its not that hard to turn them to a PC game, the story is how to be expected, the writing is good enough. The visuals are good, the sound and bgm as well. The character development works as expected, the fights work as expected. There is not much to say about it. A working conversion.

Where this game falls short is the lack of a ""dungeonmaster"", where in a pen&paper tabletop, the dungeonmaster adjust everything on the fly so everyone have fun, a PC game simply lacks this dungeonmaster. The game is a 1:1 conversion of the rules and the campaign without proper adjustments to make it work as a PC game. Also, the game lacks a ton of ""quality of life"" stuff and suffers from some ""design"" flaws that never were fixed, and this flaws are attributed to the 1:1 conversion of the tabletop. It appears the devs paid no attention to detail and make it work.

Some examples:
There is a timed quest that requires you to come during a specific day, yet there is no calendar where you can check the weekdays... so on to the internet, check the Pathfinder ruleset and find for yourself... ah ok have to wait 4 days.
Or there is another time quest, that requires you to come in specific month, again no calendar to check it up... so go to the internet, check the Pathfinder ruleset and find for yourself... and ok I have two months.
Whole thing kind of weird, since there are another quests, that actualy tell ""you have xy days left"". So the mechanic is there. But not used properly.

Another one would be the travel on the world map, easily THE thing that cost me a lot of my time while in the game... I would says 1/3 I spend watching the party icon moving from point to point, slugishly, especialy in mountains. Booooring, stupid. Its a PC game, why dont we have a speed up button, why cant we use horses or other ways of moving around?

The game has no ! and ? above the heads of the NPCs and so you have to talk to everyone for quests, a breeze of fresh air where usualy everything is served on a silver plater? Well I do not know. Finding the quests is not the problem, the problem is finding the locations where to do them. See, the quest descriptions from NPCs and in your journal are not realy descriptive. Both tell you what the problem is, but not more. Sometimes you will see a red ! above some location and know there is something to do, but mostly nothing and it is just a wild gues, at best, where to go. Another thing where you will spend a lot of time on the internet to find out where to go.

Next would be the resting. So you can setup a camp, say who goes hunting, who cooks, who plays guard, but you can not realy setup for how long you want to rest. Ok you can... 24h hours, but you want to rest (skip) 3 days... nope, one day max, and then again and then again. Easy in the capital, not so much in the wildernes (a problem when you have to wait for a specific day). Next is, the ruleset is not adjusted accordingly. The basic rules are too strict, any DM knows it and makes adjustments so it works. But not here. A failed roll is a failed roll and so it happens, that giants can sneak up on you in a forest.

I think the worst thing is the kingdom management. You see, the whole points you get are pointless, except for they determinje how much money for buildings and projects you get. Beside that, your ""barony"" depends on events. This means, you have top scores in economy, military, loyalty, community, stability, yet the people are revolting because your advisors failed a problem event. And the advisors you get arent even that good or fit for what they have to do. Or the conversion of villages to towns to cities... well  per region under you rule you have one village, if you have 3 villages, you can convert one to a town, if you have 3 towns... which requires you to have 9 regions, you can convert one town to a city. But since the number of regions is limited by the game, there is not much you can do, you will always end up with the same amount of cities, towns and villages. Quite idiotic when you thin, that many buildings are only available to towns and to cities. Ok now, Pathfinder Kingmaker is a RPG, not a city builder and not a kingdom manager, but where a tabletop is limited, a computer is not. It could have been done better.

As said, this are just examples. There are more things like this.

All in all, there is nothing perticularly awful about the game. It laks polishment, a lot, mostly of the ""quality of life"" stuff. Most of the time I enjoy the game, but every now and then I ask myself ""wtf was that not done""... ""wtf was that not done""... ""why this"".... ""why that"". It is annoying and why I can not recommend it.

Edit: 200hrs in and the game is still not even close to the end, it drags itself out for no good reason. I am fighting Pitax goons now and ask myself all the time ""why havent they conquered the world yet?"" They are so much stronger then anything else. It is laughable, immersion is out the window. What kept me going is just a chore now and I ask myself every 5 steps ""when will this crap be finaly over?"" Pathfinder Kingmaker succumbed to THE problem of any RPG ""who will create the most deadly effect?"". My two weapon fighting main have 6 attacks for 40+ damage each it they are needed to get rid of the ridiculously overpowered enemies with too many hp.

If you can stomach killing a thousand giant centipedes, a thousand giant frogs, and a thousand spiders...this game is for you. If you hate the fact that mythology seems to Typhon and Echidna offspring (known in greek mythology as the Hydra, the second of Hercules' Twelve labors) as a Unique and Epic in nature...this game is for you.

When this game finally jumps the shark completely is when you have to equip certain items to jump in and out of multiple universes in complete random orders to get to a liniar ending (SPOILER ALERT) to poison a plant. OK Those are the good points. The game cheats on die rolls (and has the audacity to show you the cheat, over and over. Look, if the AC of the critter is 18 and you have a +11 to your attack and you have watched yourself roll a d20. Each facet of a d20 is 5%, 18-11=7 pretty basic math...try rolling a d20 100 times and see if you can not roll a 7 or higher 100 times...Good Luck. The RNG in here is INSANE. It gives you a DC of 14 for a test and you have a +15 to your roll...but you fail, over and over and over. Dont get me started, best to not look at the numbers at all....remember its Pathfinder..its already a weenie system for Hack n'Slush Roll (not Role)Players.

As a PnP RPG player of 20 years I didn't really feel like I'm the intended audience. I'm not enough of a munchkin or a min-maxer.

This game has a very long list of obvious flaws that is too long for this place. But it feels like playing with a novice and overzealous game master. Too much, too unfocused and way too long (it took me 175h on hard, done 90% of game content).

There is some good stuff that should be mentioned. There are a lot of decisions that are not obvious and not morally naive. I was playing a Lawful Evil character and I felt as if I could do that without falling into silliness. Sometimes the Evil option was really the best option and you got rewarded and not punished for ""being the bad guy"". Any alignment is done as it should and you can stay consistent in your playthrough.

I see no replayability as it's just too long.

My tips if you will play it:
- use wiki shamelessly
- hire a mercenary early on (they can be any advisor you want)
- switch kingdon management to automatic (it's boring and influence nothing at all)
- stick to your character alignment
- don't get discouraged, this game cheats and first playthrough will be frustrating",1658144558,1658233119,False,2,0,0.508890807628631592,0,True,False,False

I'm saying NO because most people won't be familiar enough with the rule set to take this game on, and you do need to know the rules, given the super wonky challenge (ridiculously easy to ridiculously difficult on the same map). 

Also, and this is a big one, the devs really didn't take the time to tune it for performance. I run RDR2 better than this. HZD gets higher frames on ULTRA than this on Medium, and it looks like it's maybe 15 years old. 

It also frustrates me when performance issues are both widespread and well known, and the developers completely ignore them, then release another game to get more $$$. 

With that aside, the positive is that the actual characters are interesting, the story is fun, and the land is good to explore. The music was also surprisingly really nice. It's rough because this goes from looking like a work of care, to a work of negligence all in minutes of play. 

I got it on sale and feel like I 'maybe' got my money's worth, and I know the rule set. So that's where my recommendation would be - on sale, familiar with the rules. Otherwise, I'd choose one of the MANY other great CRPGs available.

THE GOOD:
It's really non-linear. You don't have to follow every quest in sequence after the entry mission. Though, some quests do have time limits, but you can go pretty much wherever you want. Just keep in mind the farther you go out from the starting regions, the tougher the beasties become.
The story. I like the idea of building a barony, and the major quests are interesting (and hard).
I've never had the game crash on me. So, that's definitely a plus.
Combat: Combat is fun. I like that it can be changed from real-time to turn-based whenever you want. Spells and capabilities, scrolls, and effects are visually enjoyable.
Bag of Holding: Very nifty. Get one, or two. They make a huge difference in your party encumbrance so you can carry more stuff.

THE BAD:
Party Mechanics: You can only adjust your party formation when you enter an area, and not from the main map.
Quest Mechanics: NPC X gives you a quest to retrieve item N which, is in a swamp. Okay. What swamp? What region? In the early stages of the game when you haven't explored the entire map, most quests will popup an indicator on the map showing you where to go, and you have to figure out how to get there. However, because I have visited every standard location, and mapped every pathway, when I get a new standard NPC quest there is NO on-map indicator of where to go. C'mon guys. Very frustrating. 
Region Mechanics: To the west is the Pitax region. It's separated by a river from the eastern regions. The river crossings are all held by pirates, and you can't cross. There is NO indication of a questline, or character growth requirement for how to cross and either fight, or bypass the pirates. If the region is inaccessible because it's not part of the game, then the river crossings should not be there. Again ...very frustrating.
Weapons and Armor: There are shops and traders where you can buy equipment, but inventories don't seem to update, and selections are limited. There are some magic items for sale, but they are usually a bit generic (+1 Long sword, +1 Plate Armor, etc.), and some of the party members favor unique weapons that I can't find similar replacements for. You'd think after building a smithy, upgrading it to a forge, etc. the items for sale would improve with the Kingdom/Barony's growth. Nope. The best weapons and armor are found during adventures, and many don't fit the weapon proficiency of the party members. Very frustrating.
Treasure: Once you've mapped all the regions and their various locations, there's not a great way to make/gather gold. Gold is needed to buy Build Points (if your towns don't make them fast enough to suit your needs), and BP is expensive. Also frustrating.

Overall, a good RPG hack-and-slash along the lines of Baldur's Gate. I'm still playing it - I haven't finished it yet. There are definitely some frustrating mechanics that I hope I figure out, but they can become extremely annoying later in the game as I've explained.

Their is a lot of dice rolling behind the scene, so it can get frustrating at times, and the kingdom management is pretty light, but I still enjoyed it. Also i'm not sure how? But the RNG seems to be the most fair I've ever seen, I f'ing hate RNG and it ruins a lot of great games, but here? It just felt fair somehow. You know when you save scum a 80% chance compared to a 20% chance? Most games seem biased to fail. Meaning that 80% will fail a hell of a lot more then 20% succeeds. 
Not here, 20% still fails like you would expect, but 80% rarely fails. That alone impressed the hell out of me, it shouldn't but it did. 
The story was well done, and choice consequences felt just enough right. I played a benevolent sorcerer king and I felt like I was making my subjects lives easier and happier, and my ending reflected just that.

Negatives
-Story events expect that you are doing fine with Kingdom management, and reguraly claming territories(These barbarians on ours borders deal with them = I had to go past 2 unclaimed regions, your kingdom/capital is flourishing = had riots everywhere, 1 claimed region and my capital is village, etc.)
-Loading screens - same as Pillars of Eternity, the more you do, longer the loading times

Play this game like it is real life, not as normal game. Read carefully, almost all the people that skip dialoge will have no idea what to do or that there is even time limit in first chapter.
This game feels great. The writing is good (not the greatest).
People are complaining, about difficulty, saying hard is too hard, others say challenging is easy(this has to do with how you build your party). It has classic ""problem"", like in BaldursGate spellcasters are weak early, powerhouses on endgame, and if you pick damge spells on lower level you are gonna have harder time.
Think I can recommend this now, but if you dont look up information, or dont have talent/luck, you are going to break your 1st playthrough with Kingdom Managment, and will need to start 2nd (there is Autopilot for KM, also Invincible Kingdom mode, if you have problem you can turn it on).
Also few people complain about bugs, when in reality it is working as intented.

640820,118445699,76561198043273124,0,80,4141,0,4141,1654995796,"Disclaimer: 
I've been playing DnD for over twenty-five years now.  I played 1st edition Pathfinder, and even ran this very campaign in a tabletop pen and paper group.  I am a huge RPG fan in general, and rank Neverwinter Nights near the top of my favorite games of all time.  I loved Baldur's Gate and it's sequels.  I loved Divinity.  I loved Pillars of Eternity.

Having said this, I cannot recommend this game.

I'm rewriting this review in an attempt to be more coherent.

The first 15 hours of gameplay or so is fine.  This takes you through the first ""module"" of the campaign, where you confront the Stag Lord and open up the actual kingdom building part of Kingmaker.  There were some small issues with the game mainly concerning the UI and how clunky things like movement is, but overall, it's still a solid 3.X port.  The characters are fun, the dialogue is solid, and the story has been entertaining.  Some early dungeons are a bit grindy, but the map exploration, the alignment system, the diverse dialogue options, and of course all your character options are pretty top notch.

Issues I faced included trying to move a character, and then finding out that I moved them 1-ft too far and now they're considered to have double-moved, or trying to click on the other side of an enemy to set up a flank and have issues positioning my character to do that, given that I don't remember an option to rotate the camera.  I also didn't like the magus class at all.  The magus is one of my favorite classes in tabletop, but I had a lot of issue with using their abilities in combat, and the game just throws that at you without a real explanation of how it works.

From a mod perspective, there were some mods I opted for in my second playthrough that I wouldn't recommend, namely the one that changes the base classes for some of the characters, and unloading a bunch of different character options on the player.  I didn't like the changes made to the characters that much, and when leveling I often felt paralyzed by choice, unable to find and make the right choice because it would get lost in the press of all the bad added choices.

But I'd still play the game with these flaws.  I'd play the game and love it.  Tabletop is flawed, too.

But, no, once you defeat the Stag Lord, the game goes downhill almost immediately.  For me, the kingdom building was a massive miss.  Again, a tutorial would have been nice to try and figure out how everything works, as it isn't obvious.  Oh, sure, the actual mechanics of it all isn't hard to grasp, but navigating through the game windows and locations to try to figure it out gave me headaches.  I understood what I wanted to do, but wasn't sure if I was doing it.  In my last playthrough I clicked a button and accidentally lost a month of game time.

So when I got annoyed enough at messing with the kingdom, I thought I'd blow off steam by exploring the map a bit and working on those objectives.  But here I was met with a new surprise.  Whereas before I could pretty much handle any combat I found myself in, the first place I decided to explore had a trio of wererats that were so far out of my league...  I would have struggled with two of them.  You need to go into this combat with silver weapons prepped, and of course I had zero on me.  The damage reduction is otherwise pretty hard to get through without playing the barbarian power attacking with a two-hander.  My dual-wielding rogue with sneak attack could do it, too, if their ACs weren't in the upper echelons.  I stomped the Stag Lord, and my very next combat I get my butt handed to me.  So I reload, and then buff myself to the heavens before entering combat, and... same result.  OK....

So in tabletop, the DM can steer the party away from dangerous encounters, or leave open an escape route.  In a video game, I expect the game to do the same.  Give some warning that I'm going to be facing lycanthropes.  Give me some access to silver or cold iron weapons.  Or don't spawn the wererats until I am at a level appropriate to defeat them.

My very next encounter after giving up on the wererats seemed to be plot related, and yet again I was run over by much higher level combatants.  I feel like I could probably win this combat if I kept at it, but at this point I am just tired.  I fooled around for an hour or two with the kingdom stuff, loaded and reloaded for a couple of hours trying to defeat the wererats, and have no desire to duke it out with something else that is going to give me this much of a hard time.  I put the game down over a month ago and haven't yet come back to it, and every time I consider it, I look for excuses to do something else.  I have no desire to play this if the next 100 hours of gameplay are going to be real similar to what I'm going through now.

I want to keep leveling up my characters, but I don't like or fully understand the archetypes this mod is using, and don't want to go through retraining them, and I certainly don't want to spend hours min-maxing.  I want to see the plot unfold, but the kingdom building has been a disconnect for me.  And I don't want to ever have to restart this game again and go through the grind under the tree.

If you're looking for a solid RPG that is similar to this, go play Pillars of Eternity.  Go play Neverwinter Nights 2.  Both games include minor city / castle upkeep mechanics, solid plots, similar leveling systems, and well-developed party members you can interact with.

The graphics and sound are nice as is the character creation and it looks to have a great deal of depth in terms of Character builds. 

I found the lack of ability to rotate the camera EXTREMELY frustrating as I really couldn't see what was happening half the time, if you are going to have a fixed camera view on an isometric game then at least do what games well over 20 years old managed and make the walls and scenery translucent so you can actually see what is going on. 

This is not however why I am not recommending it, that is because after playing through chapter one and not doing it fast enough my game is now over and there is no way I want to go through the tedium of starting again. It could have told me before I got to the final act that I had run out of time instead it let me play on and spend hours in the final dungeon of act one only telling me I had failed upon completion of that dungeon, had it bothered to inform me earlier i would not be able to complete it in time then I would recommend it but after doing all that I have no desire to ever play it again. 


Edit I am changing my review to a thumbs up totally due to the modding community that helped make this game a much less frustrating experience. 

I would recommend it now but with caveats. The main one being get some mods. 
For a start the camera mod and the box of tricks mod. 

The camera mod helps deal with the terrible design decision to fix the camera for no reason at all. 
The box of tricks mod helps with funds to hire mercenaries to replace the deliberately badly designed companions you are given to struggle with by the devs. 

I mean what kind of sadists design a game with companions that are not only sub optimal but actually gimped by being given the wrong stats for their classes.
I would also recommend watching a fair few youtube videos as the information given in tooltips is also very poor and doesn't help to understand the system and mechanics in any way at all.

At least for casual play (but then there are many veterans who said the same thing). I came intrigued for it's kingdom-building system, and I solely stay for it. Nothing else. 

With that being said, I'm a casual player myself who have a minimum knowledge of pure RPG like the original Pathfinder tabletop game or D&D, And I payed the price for it (besides the actual game on steam lul). Prepare for endless amount of reloading saves for reasons that is game design, many people have touched this subject and it's not from casuals like me, RPG veterans so-the like and even Pathfinder tabletop players themselves. The game hardly provide easy to get informations about what enemies do, it's hidden in a long list of Bestiary. (at least provide us some combat information for buffs when you hover over a character.)

That led to situations where you're doing this combat encounter and you can't figure out why your attacks are not doing so well, but then you finally figured out that the enemy got a special buff that forces the player to do things differently, and because you got that revelation deep into the fight, you had no choice other than reload a save and reevaluate your strategy. Some people loves this design since it made every combat encounters unique and thought provoking, but for casual players this is just tiring and exhaust your entire energy, not even mentioning all that time that you've lost. I do not recommend this game for those who are time limited for gaming sessions, you could still play it but those ""gotcha"" moments from the devs will frustate the shit out of you. 

---Kingdom Management---

I've felt most excitement in the entire game and that is unlocking the Kingdom Management feature, It's what I'm here for. And it's pretty cool, the devs provides an actual royal court and many events that you could assign your advisors to solve problems or grasp an opportunity and assuming you handled the events succesfully, you will get a small yet important stat boost for your Kingdom Stat. 

After seeing events and Kingdom Stat, my head immediately thinks of the good and bad consequences if you have a high or low Kingdom Stat for each catagory. I thought improving your Military stat is important because you're leading a newly-birth Barony and it's essential to build a reasonable military starting ground so you wouldn't be an easy picking for the neighboring kingdoms. Or the espionage where I thought if it's high enough I could cripple an entire kingdom just by doing some covert operations whether it's sabotaging their realms or assassinating key figures. 

But what I've discovered ? None of that would happens. Kingdom Stat is there just to unlocks more options to develop your Kingdom in form of buildings. How fucking boring is that. Even the kingdom crises felt so redundant, basically out of nowhere something disturb the balance of your kingdom, you would think it's political based but NO. It's just some boring ass monster or typical fantasy reasonings that you can think of, from the usual curses to ancient evil that forces you to do boring, monotone, exhausting dungeon crawls that occasionally yields some annoying and time wasting puzzles.

I only played NWN2 myself(one of my all time favs) and this, I feel, is an improvement upon that game as it's far less clunky and the D&D(now called Pathfinder) is actually filled with useful, balanced classes(even the Bard is actually useful). Keep in mind, I hate the idea of 'balance' in games. The fighter is not equal to a sorcerer or rogue, that isn't necessarily what I mean; in previous D&D games certain classes were super powerful at high levels and others were just there to catch arrows. The Paladin is a good example, where as the Death Knight had access to powerful death spells, the Paladin was just generally a weak class. Same with the Bard, nearly pointless, neglected, compared to a Cleric with a powerful array of spells. So by balanced I mean every class has a use now and can be very helpful and effective in a fight.

The multi-class function no longer has a harsh 1-level penalty(which made them irritating and inferior in NWN2 generally) so a Rogue/Wizard combo is not only viable, but EXTREMELY useful. Sneak attack acid splash anybody at level 2? Not to mention, as per Pathfinder, each main class has sub-types or archetypes within them, meaning the Magus main class, for example, has 4 total archetypes within, changing the fundmental makeup of the class at it's core in some cases. Eldritch Scion, for example, is an archetype for Magus and uses CHR instead of INT for it's spellcasting and has sorcerer-like attributes instead of wizard. Each of them offer subtle differences for multi-classing and real customized character builds. This is what Diablo 3 was supposed to evolve into, instead of going backwards like it did.

By estimation there are about 30-40 different classes and most of them you can cross-class with no level tax. I immediately missed some of the unique feats and traits NWN2 offered(ie, spellcasting prodigy and others), but in place of those imbalanced(although super cool) feats are plenty more teamwork feats and class-specific traits and abilities that more than make up for it. The game definitely benefits from a more balanced 'D&D' version, offering greater use to traditionally inferior classes. The Ranger class is more useful, as is Rogue, Bard, etc - I'm anxious to see a Paladin as well because they were always quite wretched.

The voice acting is on par with NWN2, the story is also good thus far. And P:K expanded upon the NWN2 concept: that is to say, exploration is core but so is some kingdom management. All of it is story and character driven, there's no true management like in a RTS, it's more about decision-making, some timing and paying attention to time spent away from the capital. But you really do build up towns and expand your kingdom while continuously exploring and growing your character build and gear builds.

I can only think of one real con when comparing it to NWN2. NWN2 had an extensive and intricate AI system that could help dictate how your companions behaved. A wizard wouldn't engage in melee, for example, certain abilities or spells were off-limits(meaning the player gets to pick when/if it's used), behavioral patterns between rogues, fighters and other classes were very good and really helped stave off irritating behavior from weaker characters. K:P has a bare minimum AI system at best, meaning you the player need to control EVERYTHING the characters do if you want to survive.

The game offers a wide scale of difficulty as well, which NWN2 could have used - and trust me, you're going to want to tone down the difficulty during the first play through. The hardest part of the game so far had been surviving from levels 1-4, as about half the encounters you will run into superior opponents that really require some insight and sometimes luck to survive. Sometimes you'll run into an encounter that your party simply cannot defeat(at the current level) and will require you to regress a bit or find a way to avoid the conflict.

SAVE OFTEN(no different from NWN2 frankly).

The game offers well over, by my estimation, 40 hours of gameplay. I'm about 10ish in linear game(excluding the multiple tries, regresses, etc) time and I haven't explored 80% of the map. That's quite a bit more than the typical D&D game like this one. It reminds me a lot of the 3rd DLC for NWN2, big map, lots of places to wander but while also managing a growing kingdom(the first 90 days/4 levels or so are really a tutorial in a way, a challenging tutorial), dealing with issues and opportunities at home with the help of your companions/advisors. NWN2 wishes it's Crossroad Keep aspect of the game had a kingdom system like P:K has.

The resting system is also good. Immersive is maybe the right word, there's no part of the game that doesn't require some attention and tweaking to maximize your parties skill sets. If you rest in a dungeon there's no hunting, that means you need to bring food rations with you if you need to camp underground. And the chances of getting attacked while in a dungeon while resting are, in my experience, MUCH higher than outside.

As mentioned, if you're a RPG(a REAL RPG, that Neverwinter ""mmo"" game doesn't count) enthusiast then this is absolutely the game for you. If you enjoyed the NWN games and those like it? You may end up only playing this for a while.

Also, as far as I can tell, the differences between the standard edition and the others is a bunch of artwork, the soundtrack, etc, the only one that offers real value would be the most expensive one(80-90 dollar one) that will give the following DLC's for free. And I imagine there will be plenty as there's plenty of room for more classes, etc.",1540501026,1656777307,True,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

There are *many* companions with great diversity and while they may not all appeal to everyone, they have good character. The companions are mostly salvageable even for powergamers but there are easy in-game  options and mods (Respec mod, Companion portraits) to create any gameplay experience you want.

I find the Kingdom management elements appealing and feel the game does a good job of helping you immerse yourself in the world. As always, you get out what you put in. This game won't disappoint you if you are willing make the necessary adjustments to fit your preferred playstyle.

It has a lot going for it, make no mistake.
If you are a fan of the genre there is a lot here that does it well.
Which is part of the problem. The fighting, strategy, story, and character building is all done better by other games.
There's a lot of balance issues and character creation is pretty boring.
Fights, despite being mostly linear, don't feel like they were designed with progression in mind. Several bosses make you feel like you are 5 levels to low to beat, and others make you feel like a level 20 beating up a level 1. And sometimes you will get both within a few minutes of one another in no particular order.

What this game brings to the table that are unique to the genre are the travel mechanics and kingdom mechanics.
Both of which are at best slow, and at worst a train wreck.

Watching your figure move across a map for 5 minutes just to zone into a fight that takes you 1 is not good design.
Needing to stop and rest every few seconds is not a good design.
Being forced to watch the rest, which I swear always feels like a minimum of 30 seconds is bad design.
Being forced to drop loot in order to exit a zone, especially zones you can't return to, is bad design.
Kingdom management to me is shallow. It does a great job at giving the allusion of choice, but honestly it is nearly impossible to fuck up and doesn't really reward you for being a master of the craft. Even then a lot of success is really just RNG since there is a limited number of advisors for any role, and even more limited roles for each mission.

A great deal of this game relies on RNG. Which... okay tabletop games are literally just rolling dice, but for some reason this game feels wrong. You can literally miss ""important"" random encounters that can change the story. Also a 25 dex rogue shouldn't be missing 8 attacks in a row against a kobold that can be one shot by anyone in the party.",1656563955,1656563955,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have to basically lobotomize your enemies with the built-in difficulty setting JUST to play the game. Once you get out of the tutorial castle, you are thrown into the world where you fight off a couple of bandits. No biggie, simple enough. Then you get your first fetch quest to begin leveling your party. You must find a plant to give to an alchemist who needs it for a potion. A simple quest that you can find in any RPG ever created. Well here's the issue: the cave where said flower is from is FILLED with creatures that vastly outlevel your party. The plant you need to harvest requires you to make a TWENTY 1d20 ROLL! If it doesn't? You take 1d8 damage. After this bullshit you also get introduced to the worlds worst enemy archetype: the swarm. The swarm does not need to roll for an attack. They get to move freely and if they move through your team, it's guaranteed damage. 

The worst part? They also grant diseased debuffs which can hinder your party from acting for a turn. No actually the worster (if thats a word) part is that they CANNOT be attacked with normal means. You need to use splash damage or fire. The problem with that is that it COMPLETELY weakens your ability to fight these already vastly stronger than you, overleveled creatures. If you have no AoE abilities or characters on your team (I was the only one as a sorcerer with acid splash) you just don't get to hit them. Like I said, you can use a torch but even then the rolls you need to make are insanely high and you will spend a good 10 turns to get them at minimum 50% HP. 

This game is a testament to how NOT to design your RPG's early game. I get that it should be difficult as a low level party, but this game quite literally rips you to shreds early. I used the above example to just show you how bad it is. This is supposed to be a FETCH quest and you can easily have to reload several times for it. If that's a glimpse into how bad the game is going to be going forward, then I want no part in it. I would love to experience this game as a fan of the Baldur's Gate games, Dragon Age: Origins and D:OS2, but its just too much of a headache, even when you know how the games mechanics work.

P.S.: the cherry on top of the shit cake is that once you get to the kingdom mode (the namesake of the game, which you can't even get to without suffering through extremely hard basic quests) you can LOSE the game if you mess up even the slightest in an irrelevant kingdom management simulator. This is a full loss btw. There is no returning to the save or trying again if you messed up something very early into your save.

The enemy balance is where the game completely falls apart. Many fights are completely negligible. Of the fights that are  challenging, they fall into one of two categories:
1: The enemy has an AOE crowd control. If they use it, fight over, you lose. If you are able to make yourself immune, the fight is easy.
2: The enemy has insane armor and spell resist, and will heal themselves. These turn into hour-long attrition battles where you have to wait for the enemy to burn though all of their resources. 

I made the mistake of playing a caster since that is what I usually enjoy playing in fantasy games. Turns out every enemy of significance has spell resist to the point that you shouldn't even bother using magic on them. Why make an entire category of characters useless in every boss fight? Is making the enemy frustrating to try to hit really the only way to provide challenge? You couldn't involve some interesting mechanics in any boss fights besides ""Its the same as the other enemies except numbers bigger""?

I really enjoyed much of this game, but by the time i got near the end, every enemy took so long to take down that I just decided to uninstall.

It has good role playing options in the dialog and banter between the various characters, who are all quite interesting with tons of personality. You get these other party members based on your actions and alignment.
There tons of character options for race, class and even prostegeous class' as in D&D 3.5 and Patherfinder, obviously.

On paper this should be a phenomenally interesting game.
But every character is a modern/woke cliche.  
Every Combat encounter is designed to be frustrating until you learn ""THE RIGHT WAY"" to play.
The interactions with characters turns out to be a long, drawn out and boring reading exercise, which feels like a fifteen year old's Baldur's Gate fanfiction, where they REALLY wanted to put in every possible sexuality, just so EVERYBODY is included, and ended up making every character unappealing right from the first time you talk to them.
Characters who immediately talk about relationships the first time you meet them come across as needy and manipulative.   This game wants you to love it so much that it doesn't see how it's being creepy.

The game started off very enjoyably, though many quests were very vague on how to proceed (I should have realized that this was a sign of things to come).  Eventually, however, the game devolved to the point where I spent almost as much time online seeking quest information as I did in game.  Finally, after having put many hours into the game, the main quest refused to proceed and I ended up losing as a result.

I looked everywhere online.  All of the information indicated that if you do certain things, other things should happen to move the quest forward... well they didn't, and there was no indication why not.

Even if that quest had proceeded, I still would have downvoted this game due to the sheer frustration (and lack of information in game) involved in trying to complete so many quests.

I have always been interested in kingdom management as part of the rpg experience. Baldurs Gate  2, Neverwinter nights 2 all tried this out. It started really coming into its own with Pillars of Eternity and then Dragon Age Inquisition. This game though makes it more a part of the main story than even Dragon Age did. 

Another great thing for those who don't enjoy kingdom management is you have the option to avoid it as much as possible in the settings to make it a more traditional RPG. There are tons of settings to play with in this game. Not the least of which is the ever great option to play turn based or realtime at will. 

There are some exceptional things about this game. I found the merging of kingdom management and traditional RPG to be done just right. Best of any RPG game I have ever played. The musical score and voice acting was well done. 

The story was great. They created an entirely new world and tons of world building here. Tons of stuff to read if you want which reminded me much of older Bioware games. The highlighting in text that gives you more info was perfect. 

The Companions system was great. From their stories to quests just about all of them interesting. Nik-Nok for myself was the most interesting companion since Minsc, and more funny. 

The game play will feel familiar to anybody who has played Baldur's gate or Pillars of Eternity. A pretty complicated character creation and leveling system. Its easy to multi class and easy to mess up if you make poor choices. 

There are a few things that could use improving. When you summon or shape shift into something big it becomes hard to see whats going on around the large character.  That is one reason I chose pets that don't reach ""large"" size but max out at medium. Its just easier. Very minor complaint. Turning your pet into a Black Dragon? Its tons of fun. 

I spent too much time exploring and less kingdom management so near the end that's all I did right up towards the ending. 

As for DLC the depths was really well done. Nicely integrated into the main story and some of the most difficult fights in the game. 

I had an amazing experience with this game. I took my time so I could experience everything. One of best rpg's in years. Its my favorite since Pillars of Eternity 1 and ranks up there all time with the best RPG's ever created.",1655783886,1655783886,True,2,0,0.526532411575317383,0,True,False,False

For a someone like myself with zero D&D experience, this game feels like a good intro to the D&D game. That said, the question is, ""would you recommend this game?"" > in short, absolutely not.

There's so much to get your head around from lore, building your hero the difficulty, kingdom management etc I loved it all until I got upto the end area which utterly killed the game for myself and all the drive I had to finish the story. 

It's not that the final area is hard, it is, however that didn't faze me. My issue is that that the area feels poorly designed due to the emphasis on reloading the game due to turning a wrong corner and getting into a fight that you have no way of winning without a certain spell/character etc.

Much like in regards to the game, my patience here trying to type a review that's level headed has run out. I'd recommend this game until the last area.

I did particularly liked chapter 1 and the character creator. I was disappointed to learn that I missed recruiting Jubilost Narthropple due to not going to an exact area at an exact time. Since I never got him I don't know what I'am missing so it doesn't truly bother me as much as it did others (I've read a few threads and reviews moaning about this).

I really enjoyed the Varnhold's Lot and The Wildcards DLC not so much Beneath The Stolen Lands DLC. Beneath The Stolen Lands felt like a chore to finish in the campaign.

EDIT 1: Turns out ""the final area"" (the House at the Edge of Time) wasn't the final area. I'm at the stage that I don't care about anything that's happening in-game, I just want it finished. The last - estimated -  20 hours of the game at the time of typing has been awful.

EDIT 2: Just finished the game. I haven't changed my mind about anything.

I am having a lot of enjoyment with it and with the Call of the Wild and Bag of Tricks mods I've figured out how to make my character a Synthesist Summoner (adding twin eidolon buff and desummoning my eidolon) It's a dream come true for me, since most people think playing a Synthesist is OP. But then I can just up the difficulty of the game.

2020 Edit: With mods this game is a lot better. Fixing the glaring issues with QoL mods like stopping the main quest timer and making it turn based is night and day. However, this game wasn't built to be modded and IMO mods should not be required to make a game worth playing. On its own, I still wouldn't recommend this game. What I praise is the mod makers for letting me enjoy something I would have never touched again otherwise.

Edit: I stopped playing this game about a week after I bought it. Mostly because I realized that it was incomplete. They are adding DLC meant to run with the original campaign and they will likely continue to do so. I'm going to change my review to Not Reccomended, because I feel like this game is still in Early Access.

I spent many years playing Pathfinder, and luckily I've never played the Kingmaker campaign. This game is awesome. The writing, the gameplay. Everything is great.

I bought the game looking past some of the negative reviews that said the game was too hard, but once I found out that the difficulty was customizable I was very happy. I set everything up as close to vanilla Pathfinder as I could. Keeping everything at a level playing field. The game is hard, its true. But you have to plan ahead, think and get used to the system.

After learning how to properly control combat things felt very balanced. I had no trouble beating the wolves at the first encounter even before the hot fixes. It looks like the devs are listening to everyone's complaints and are working to balance everything.

This is the updated ""Baulder's Gate"" that I've always wanted. I love the character creation and am currently leveling a Barb/Sorc/DD. I just wish the whole thing was voice acted.

I am enjoying the RtwP aspect. Sure I would enjoy a true Turn Based combat more, but I feel like its almost as good.

I personally loved the Kingdom Management mechanics, this game is one of the very few games that combines RPG and strategy/nation sim elements, and i think more games should do that. I absolutely adore the way you can influence the shape of your kingdom through events and decisions, and the ending slides makes for a good fluff material.

Now to the downsides. This game is very dependent on the decisions you made, whether explicitly or not. Choosing one wrong dialogue option could derail you from the outcome you wanted. Because of that, there's no shame in looking at guides or savescumming (i especially recommend you to savescum). This game could be finished in 80-100 hours, but mine took 300 hours since i restarted my playthrough 2-3 times because i made irreversible mistakes.

There are also a few bugs, that sadly would probably never be fixed by the devs because they had moved on to other projects. One very recent (and annoying) one i experienced is on the last chapter, a bug occured and i can't buff two of my characters.

Overall though, this is still a game i wholeheartedly recommend,",1655663119,1655663119,True,6,1,0.585135877132415771,0,True,False,False

Lots of great roleplaying decisions to be made and the kingdom management system isn't half bad once you get it up and running.

The only downsides are: the balance between adventuring and kingdom-running aren't really balanced between each other and you'll have to sacrifice a lot to get the best endings; you run the risk of really wrecking your playthrough by making certain decisions that aren't telegraphed or explained at all to the player; and I ended up getting 3 critical bugs - 2 were showstoppers that broke the main quest and a huge side quest and 1 forced me into a RP I really didn't like so I had to edit my savefile to fix them and redo those areas.

There's a lot to like about Kingmaker. The premise of building a kingdom in a forsaken land while desperately juggling competing demands is fantastic. You feel the Sword of Damocles swinging above your head with each decision, and there's never a moment where resources feel abundant or decisions feel trivial.

But this thing is unplayable. It's common to get trapped in permanent failstates and have to start the game over. If you go to the forums, you'll read that the real game begins after everything breaks and you have to restart from the beginning, which seems more like Stockholm syndrome than a rational opinion to have about a crpg that takes over a hundred hours to complete.

My first permanent failstate was when the savegame system exploded seventy hours in from trying to track every item in every corpse I had created. This made saving the game take several minutes; I ended up bringing a book to read while it saved, but the problem kept getting worse. After a few internet searches, I learned that there was a cleaner mod that fixes this problem, but it requires revisiting every area to clean it. I gave up after a few hours of unsuccessfully vacuuming the game back to life.

I should have had enough sense to drop Kingmaker after that, but I was invested in the story. In my second run, the permanent failstate was going through a portal which crashed the game and created an error message. I tried reverting to an earlier savegame, but it broke again at the exact same spot. After several hours of internet searches and opening up the savegame files I was unable to fix the problem.

5th time is the charm. This is the 5th time I've restarted the game and my second play through up to the end. I finally understand this game and managed to get the kingdom building done. This game is in essence two games: a story driven CRPG and a kingdom management game. The story can be played without worrying too much about the kingdom management if you feel like putting kingdom management on auto, but you miss out on some perks like artisans and masterpieces as well as a few quests. 

The story game is very well done. It's an engaging story. Each chapter has a pretty fun and interesting antagonist. Lots of fun questing and exploring to do. Battle is as expecting. The character building is robust and interesting because it uses the PF1 class, race, and archetype model which makes for lots of choices. You get a lot of cool magic items.  The story is overall a fun experience. Make sure you keep track of and do the Ancient Curse whenever it comes up at the right time or you'll experience issues.

Kingdom management. This is what frustrated me for a time. But I finally figured out how to manage the kingdom. I highly suggest you put this on auto if all you care about is the story. I suggest you put it on easy or effortless your first play through if you want to do kingdom management and not have it negatively impact your game. Do some research on kingdom management. You do not get good cues for how to do kingdom management or how long you have to do quests when you're busy doing kingdom management which can consume a lot of days in the game even if the actual real time playing the game is small. 

If you don't learn kingdom management, it can have a very negative experience on the main story. I highly suggest you learn this prior because you can have your game and kingdom destroyed by bad kingdom management. You could do everything in the story right and still lose because you overlooked something in kingdom management. It will likely be the most frustrating part of the game. All my buddies who played this game quit because the kingdom management design was so bad at providing guidance as to how to best do it. It would have a terrible, ruinous effect on their game play experience and they didn't want to bother restarting again to try to do it. It is not well synced to the story and has a terrible in game learning curve.

It's a lot of fun, and it is (after many updates) well made. A couple of bugs but nothing horrible. Play it if you like CRPGs, it has a turn-based mode that works well and makes it feel like a mechanically dense D:OS. I got it for 10 bucks and played one campaign for 250h. Just be wary buying future games at release from this developer, since it was totally broken at launch.

The biggest selling point is how deep and interesting your character builds can be, and how that affects combat. The story develops in an intereting way, I [i]mostly[/i] enjoyed the wrting for the characters, and people complain about kingdom management but it's kind of a fun minigame, just turn the difficulty down (but not to ""auto"") so you aren't stressing about an engine building boardgame in the middle of your CRPG.

I have my gripes:

I don't like games that force you to look things up online, and this game simultaneously drowns you in information while giving you no competent direction for how to build your characters. Every google is one more chance to spoil yourself, and the story is cool so that would be a shame. Unless you have an intimate knowledge of the Pathfinder system, you will want to look up builds online, not to copy, but just to understand what your options are and why people make certain choices. Don't be afraid to enable the in-game respec option.

Story decisions suffer the same problem: to make the choice you want in the present, you often have to have ALREADY made a particular other choice in the past before you knew where it was going. My playthrough was 250 hours. I'm not re-playing 245 hours of the same game to get 5 hours of new content. You want a ""good"" option for your companion? Sometimes you have to be honest and supportive. Sometimes you have to shut them down. Sometimes you have to use reverse psychology. Have fun guessing which to use when. Or use a mostly-spoiler-free companion outcome guide.

The same can be said for the main story, as some people would argue that one ending is more ""real"" than the others, and requires some weirdly specific choices you'd probably never do unless you knew ahead of time. Some people would say it's an ending for people who've played already and understand what's happening. I say it's a 250 hour long game, give me the ending with the most interesting and satisfying content please. I lucked out and discovered it was an option while looking something else up, and fortunately I hadn't messed up any of the conditions yet. But it's incredibly unlikely you'd get it without a guide. Unfortunately there are no spoiler-sensitive guides to it. You will unavoidably be spoiled on what you need to accomplish to get the ending, and you'll have to read [i]very carefully[/i] to avoid spoiling all the in-between points.

Balance and level design is mostly good, but some of the design choices are just. not. fun. And I don't know what they were thinking. Too many random encounters. Some of the early encounters, and almost the entire last-ish chapter seems intentionally (lazily?) designed to be un-fun. They balance out a lot of interesting story beats with the least interactive and most repetitive fights in the game. A good problem is fun to solve, but these problems are either SUPER easy because RNG favored you (or you knew ahead of time and prepared), or are total nightmares where you have no control over anything, and sometimes half-and-half. None of the options are really ""fun"". ""Tolerable"" at their best. Before playing I looked up what people recommended for difficulty settings, and I advise you do the same, it felt good just about the whole time. Enable 3 or so autosave and quicksave slots and quicksave often. You're ready.

Also one very particular thing that I can't explain very well without spoiling it, but I have to say something about it, so I'll just make indecipherably vague complaints: WHY did you do that? It just weakened both the plot [i]and[/i] the play experience, I get why it's an exception, but why in the world is there nothing the player do about it? What is the problem with it not happening?! What does that break? You thought of a cool idea and decided it was worth taking a dump on my play experience to force me to look at your idea for a second and say ""huh yeah I guess that's neat. but why though?"". That's not even to call out that the entire [i]thing[/i] that this instance is a part of... doesn't need to happen. At all. Nobody's saying ""man I'm so glad you stopped letting me have fun the way I wanted to AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME because of choices I made that had no logical link to the outcome"". Whatever weirdo had the power fantasy that allowed [i]that nonsense[/i] to make it into the final game better have blown their load hard enough to offset all the negativity that decision put into the world.

Anyway, I complain like this because I really liked the game and I wish it was even better. If you're kind of thinking about picking Kingmaker up, I really recommend it. I'm being critical, but warts and all it's a fantastic game.",1655278166,1655278341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you love both RPGs and strategy games, you may actually love this game. It combines a Fantasy story with realm-building elements. If you're like me and don't really care for realm-building strategy simulations, that part may feel like a chore and you may want to set kingdom management to automatic in the game options and change the difficulty so that your kingdom just cannot fail completely and end your game.

That doesn't fix all the issues you may see if you're mostly interested in a story-based RPG, because the kingdom building is still a key aspect in the central story, it's your overarching motivation for everything you do. So, if you're playing a chaotic character who couldn't really care less for being a king, that's a bit of an issue. The story never really became as personal to me as I usually hope for. But I've come to terms with that.

The merits are certainly in the way the game captures the D&D pen-and-paper feel. 
Me personally, I've played all the classic RPGs from Pool of Radiance, Eye of the Beholder etc. to The Bard's Tale, the Ultima series, etc. In Neverwinter Nights I've clocked a gazillion hours in various persistent MP worlds. More recently I've tried to play Pillars of Eternity, but I really couldn't be bothered to learn all those new rules. Sure, back in the days you had to learn the rules for each new RPG you played, quite often from scratch, or at least for every new franchise. But back then you used to have a hundred pages of manual to explain everything in excruciating detail before actually playing. You didn't have to play once half-blind to learn the stuff your characters would already know. With Pillars of Eternity I felt I didn't know what I was doing most of the time. Pathfinder: Kingmaker hits that sweet spot where I felt familiar with a lot of the mechanics, there were still a lot of subtle differences to discover, and you have a way to rebuild your characters from level 0 if you find you messed up. The result was that my party on my first playthrough was kinda ok for normal difficulty. Yes, the fighter-rogue two-hand-weapon specialist I rolled near the end of the game as another damage dealer was far more impressive than any other melee character around, but hey, that's to be expected, too.

I also loved the ""book episodes"" that feel a lot like your DM telling a story in your PnP session, and the way you can play different styles depending on the skills you wish to leverage.

I encountered very few technical difficulties. Sometimes, especially with large groups of enemies, the game wouldn't progress the round. But the simple fix was to hit T to exit out of turn-based mode (which is how I played) and then hit T immediately again, so no big deal.

Sometimes I felt the game was heavily metagaming against me, but oh well. Sometimes the balance was a little weird. There is a chapter in another dimension near the end of the game (or potentially the last chapter) that is tough in a very annoying manner, to an extent where you may need to rest after every other battle. It felt a bit like the game was trying to teach me not to prefer the dungeon crawls over the kingdom building. The very final chapter felt like a cakewalk, in comparison. (But then again, I stocked up on scrolls for about 2 million gold for that.)

All in all, it's a charming CRPG that does a lot of things right to capture that PnP atmosphere, if you can appreciate or get over the strategy parts. Do I feel like I need to replay it? Not immediately, but maybe at some point. Does it make me want to play Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous?

One moment, I'm thoroughly enjoying myself and then the next, I'm ready to throw my keyboard through my monitor at the often ridiculous game mechanics, or eye rolling so hard at the dialog that I get a low-grade migraine.

The game was crashing on me at least once every hour.  At times, it would lag so badly that I was forced to shut it down to desktop and reload.  Characters kept glitching through walls and getting stuck, which forced me to constantly micromanage their travels through various maps.  The UI is a little too big and there's no way to resize it.  It's especially annoying when you're trying to explore and you can't see the bottom 3rd of your screen.  I was often moving the camera manually so I didn't run into traps or a pack of monsters before I could prepare.  Some abilities don't seem to be working or have no visible effects.  True Sight DOES NOT seem do anything from what I could tell, despite the spell saying it does ten different things.  It made almost no difference in combat and doesn't actually allow you to see in the dark.  You still need a light spell or torches for the darker areas like caves and dungeons unless you jack your gamma way up.

Combat is fine, but it gets more and more tedious and frustrating in the later portions of the game.  I'm not opposed to a challenge, but when RNG is the sole arbiter of success or reloading from your last save, any challenge feels extremely artificial and lazy.  It becomes a save scumming mini-game which seems to appeal to the 'git gud' crowd who slog through the content and talk about how easy it was on the hardest settings with their frankenstein builds.

I love the story.  It's a tragic tale with all the elements of a fantasy epic that kept me entertained, despite all the other frustrations I had with the game.  The dialog with most of the companions was one of the biggest turn offs for me.  One minute, they're telling you that you're such a great person and a friend.  The next minute, you're a stupid and horrible person for not agreeing with them, or you're a stupid and and horrible person for asking them something they didn't like.  Most of my interactions with them felt like talking to a disagreeable, overly emotional, moody teenager going through puberty.  Very few NPCs I interacted with responded like a mature adult.  Valorie and Amiri in particular(IMO), are insufferable in the initial parts of the game.  I understand that people are often shaped by their experiences, but every one of the companions are the absolute extreme example of this.

The game has a very strong start, but I was ready to move on to something else by the end of it.  I have zero desire to play it again.  The numerous small annoyances with the dialog and other issues I've experienced ensured this game will likely be a one and done for me.  Maybe I'll give it another playthrough after taking a break, but I will be definitely skipping any unnecessary dialog with my companions.  Although I don't give it a recommendation, I encourage you to try it for yourself if you're a fan of games like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights.",1654966711,1655045434,False,45,2,0.750477135181427002,0,True,False,False

This game also does absolutely nothing to teach you the Pathfinder ruleset, which compared to most CRPG systems is incredibly byzantine and overcomplicated.  I enjoyed this game, however, I have been playing D&D 3.0, 3.5, and Pathfinder for nearly a quarter of a century.  If you take only one thing from this review, please take this: Kingmaker is made by Pathfinder fans for Pathfinder fans.  I would not under any circumstances recommend this game to anyone who is not already a fan of Pathfinder.  If you don't care about the Pathfinder ruleset and you're looking for a fun CRPG to play, there are far better CRPGs out there like Divinity and Naheulbeuk.  If you are specifically looking for a Pathfinder CRPG, then, well, you don't have a lot of choices except this and WotR, and this game is riddled with problems.

Kingmaker performs incredibly poorly even on high end systems when compared to other games like Divinity.  The UI leaves much to be desired.  The save files are incredibly bloated and poorly optimized; I installed this game on my 2 TB HDD and it *still* took up over 30 GB on my 128 GB SSD with save files, history files, crash logs (and the game did crash quite often), etc.  The game throws massive amounts of loot at you, so I hope you like spending hours doing inventory management.  True to Pathfinder, there are dozens of useless builds and trap choices during character building that are actually terrible.  For example, your main character really should not be a support character, but should be a capable front-liner because you will be REQUIRED to send your main character on solo missions, and often in fights with your whole party present, the enemies will beeline your main character and completely ignore your companions, so your main character better be able to take some hits and dish out damage or you're screwed, and the game gives you no warning of this requirement.  Offensive spellcasters feel great in the mid-game and then are utterly useless in the late game as most end-game enemies are outright immune to the vast majority of offensive spells, and have absurdly high saves against the ones they aren't immune to.  Bow specialists are king in this game, absolutely run Ekundayo in your party permanently, as he'll easily do 3 times the damage of any other companion.  I hope you like fighting against enemies with bullshit ability drain that you can do absolutely nothing to prevent, because you'll fight swarms of those.  And on top of all that, the core problems that are well documented about the Pathfinder ruleset are also present and prevalent in this game, like rocket tag and swingy d20 rolls.

That said, I did actually enjoy this game.  I thought the character writing was quite good, which surprised me considering the studio.  I enjoyed the setting and the overall plot of becoming a ruler of a small kingdom; it was a nice oldschool feel that harkened back to the 1st edition D&D days of building your own keep and recruiting followers.  The combat feels fun in turn-based mode once you work around the eccentricities of the game and figure out which severely nerfed builds you shouldn't use.  Most of the chapters of the game are interesting, except the last one which just feels like a very repetitive dungeon crawl.  The variety of choices you can make and how they impact the world are a lot better developed than the vast majority of RPGs, which is frankly an extremely low bar so it's not much, but it's something.  Mostly NPCs you choose to save come back later in the game to help you out or serve in your kingdom somehow, which is a nice touch.

In conclusion, I give this game a thumbs up, but with many, many caveats.  Beware what you're getting into with this game.  It's utter bullshit encounter design at times.  It's one of the most poorly-optimized game engines I've ever seen.  It's obtuse, needlessly complex Pathfinder rules minutae at times.  The inventory management will make you question what is wrong with the developers.

Initially I did not expect much from the experience other than getting another fix of my CRPG addiction but then I took a glance at the character cretion menu and, hoo boy, my underwear was sufficiently sullied with excitement.

I can only describe PK as a succesor to Infinity Engine games, not quite as direct as, say, Pillars of Eternity, but also nowhere near as removed as Baldur's Gate 3.
It strikes a kind of a sweet spot for me that continued to be scratched thoroughly in the sequel with further intensity.

The combat is what you'd expect when it comes to Infinity Engine style games but that is merely descriptive. What about the quality?
Well, it's not great, exactly. Right from the beginning you'll get the feeling that PK is not out there to coddle you, as evidenced by the godforsaken swarms. Combat and the general game design seems to indicate the game was meant for a more hardcore audience, as in the people who find a great deal of enjoyment in crunching numbers, meticulously researching their build and party composition until they break the game 112% more efficiently. If that sounds like you, then congratulations! You'll be having A LOT of fun with Kingmaker.
As for me though, I'm the kinda guy who dumps all of his stats into non-combat focused characteristics, making characters that can only be described as charismatic, eagle-eyed, wisened, hyper-intelligent wet noodles who pray to whatever gods there are in the setting to save them when a rat decides to have sapient flesh for dinner. For me the experience ended up being rather brutal at times. Especially by the end, because I did not have the hindsight to up my will saving throws sufficiently. Although it's also possible to just lower the difficulty and breeze through encounters like a hot knife through owlbear fat.

The story was an enjoyable, if cheesy, ride. It's episodic and the episodes are tied somewhat but it's not until the the penultimate and last chapter that you really get a feel for the larger narrative. Which I can totally get behind, frankly, I quite liked that mystery vibe.
The chapters are all built in a very predictable manner: ""There's a big threat to your kingdom and if you don't do something, it's all gonna come crumbling down"". We will return to the crumbling down part, but returning to the narrative, it can get tiresome to a degree. By the time of Pitax I certainly felt it was starting to drag on a bit too long, although that part in particular was pretty fun due to the combat getting a bit of a backstage (Until the finale that is). It doesn't shine any new light on age-old questions of morality, ethics or ideology, nor does it push a highly emotional and personal struggle. All that said, it still felt pretty fun, even if very tropy, just living out your heroic fantasy.

This is tied into the kingdom management. A very debatable topic and it can be polarizing depending on what you want. Personally, I actually really enjoyed it! Sure, the requirement to engage with the system can feel annoying if you just want to adventure in the wild but it's nowhere near as bad as people claim, from my experience. The checks do get hard by the end, especially if you let the kingdom go into ""crumbling down"" mode for a while during the chapters. With that said, the choices in kingdom management are also a lot of fun. Some of them tie into the ending slides, although admiteddly, not a lot. As a word of advice, do try completing the chapter main quests first. This can seem weird to some of you, especially if you're like me and enjoy doing all the side content first but trust me. There is a timer that effectively nets you a period of completely free time to explore and adventure to your heart's content before the start of the next chapter. Since dragging on the actual story can cripple you with permanent reductions to your kingdom stats, it is far more efficient to finish the story stuff first and afterwards go adventuring.

By far the greatest strength I think Kingmaker sports is the wealth of content it has. There is truly a ton to do and discover within the Stolen Lands and it's very fun, for the most part. While the game does have its fair share of fetch quests or meaningless filler, the majority of quests are interesting and have different ways of resolving the conflicts within. Now, whether those different ways of resolving said conflicts truly matter is a different discussion entirely. During a certain quest you may come across a cursed village in which a rather large quest is set. Without getting into spoilers, it seems like the intention was for there to be a moral choice by the end of it but really, there is a single correct solution and it's very clear even without reloading to get a different ending. This flaw would be fixed somewhat in the sequel, as Wrath of The Righteous seems intent on being more replayable and putting greater emphasis on choice and consequence.

From a presentation point of view, Kingmaker feels a lot like a fairytale. The colors are all bright and have that unnatural, painted quality to them. The narrative around the main villain also feels very fairytail-y (heh) about it's execution with a whole schtick about hubris, curses, suffering begetting suffering and love saving the day (That is, if you stick to the secret ending). This makes Kingmaker a very relaxing experience. Yes, it is so despite you spending most of your time in combat questioning why do the enemies have such ludicrous AC, saving throws or a gimmick that shuts down your party completely if not accounted for beforehand. It's not relaxing in a ""stroll amidst an autumn grove"" kind of way, but rather in a ""sitting near a chimney with a heroic epic in hand"". It's all grand adventures with courage, bravery, comradery, the strength of bonds, words and promises, a very idealistic existence, bound by it's own idealistic rules.

If you didn't bounce off entirely after reading that, perhaps it may be worth it to give Parthfinder: Kingmaker a shot. It most certainly isn't perfect but it's quality time.

The writing is quite good, I'm not sure how much was done by owlcat and how much was from the original module(s). I think the party members are all written by owlcat since it wouldn't make a ton of sense to have NPC's in a tabletop game, unless they're based on character pregens.
Anyway I found most of the characters to be multidimensional and interesting. Some of them you'll like, some of them you'll hate.  Gameplay-wise I really liked the ability to choose between real-time and turned based combat. when dealing with mooks it's nice to just go to real time and let your characters deal with them, but for more challenging fights you really need turn-based to get the most out of spells and abilities. There are a few bugs that I feel could be worked out - sometimes collision/spacing doesn't work correctly and your melee chars will run to the same spot, sometimes it does something weird and they will run all the way around to the other side of an enemy when there was an opening facing them.
Also, the game is not very friendly to suboptimal builds and party organization, especially on the higher difficulties, but even on normal difficulty. I can kind of guess how this happened - turn based mode takes a huge chunk of difficulty out, so the developers compensated by adding huge bonuses to enemy stat blocks. Owlbears, I saw with great irritation after two party members got instantly crit'ed to death, have +24 to damage, compared to +4 in pathfinder sourcebooks. 
anyway, if you want to play in real time mode like baldur's gate, consider sticking on normal difficulty or lower for your first playthrough. There are a lot more enemies than those games - probably 5x more - and many of them hit a lot harder. also, the difficulty scaling in the quests is not linear, so if you're having an easy time in the first chapter don't assume it's going to stay that way.",1654311907,1654311907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought it after read a bunch of reviews and was really wanting a D&D-ish game to scratch that itch. I read a lot of things about it being difficult and haven't really encountered that. I scaled the difficulty as low as it could go and just steam rolled early. After that it's been constant cranking it up to try and have some challenges. I love the interactions of characters, the backstories, all the lore, and always catch myself reading the books in the game. This is definitely a game I'll go back and throw 400 more hours into just to replay with a different character and follow a different path. 

The only complaint I ran into is how I missed out on two companions. During the troll main quest I didn't re-visit 2 locations, so I didn't get the alchemist or the ranger which is a huge bummer. Because of that I've had to dump a lot of gold into mercenaries to fill the advisor slots. 

Some recommendations to people looking to buy the game. Get the respec mod. I've respec'd most of the characters just to pick not dumb feats and stats but stuck with the lore of them. I think the only one I didn't do was the rogue because he was built perfectly. Also get the Cleaner mod. It helps clean the random loot you leave on maps and reduces the lag in game. I also got the Bag-Of-Tricks mod just so I could use the ""rest anywhere"" option. Other than those, adjust the difficulty whenever you need. There were some places with random stupidly hard mini bosses that I had to flip easy mode on just to barely survive. I'd also say use turn-based combat. I use it in almost every fight unless it's a easy goblin or bandit encounter. Other than those enjoy the game. They've done a really good job with it.

[b] The Compleat Tabletop [/b]

They really tried to give you the compleat tabletop experience, condensed for the single player. All I didn't get was my pals playing the members of my party, yammering about what they were going to do for this round (a unit of game time) or otherwise trolling me. There's a learning curve, even for players somewhat familiar with the D&D and Pathfinder systems, but it's a curve you can modify in the settings.  

Yes, you roll up stats for your character, choose from a bewildering list of classes and sub-classes, but the  game has pre-set characters, a tutorial system, and an option to take as much or as little of the leveling minutiae off your hands. 

I have mixed feelings about travel across the global map: there is no fast travel for the guy who wants to knock down the story points quickly, and exhaustion rears its ugly head as you clock the miles or carry heavy loot, and ambushes annoyingly happen. But that's exactly part of the tabletop gaming experience, and part of this game's charm.   

[b] Baron You [/b]

The Kingmaker moniker is apt. You get to run a barony, making general executive decisions, delegating to advisers you select, and traveling across the global map to meet needs that require your personal attention. It's a little like Civilization, except you have to physically travel to where you're needed, and maybe get ambushed and killed by bandits, beasts or trolls on the way.  (Yes, I waver between loving the map and hating the Gygaxian sadist that designed the random encounters on it.) Make money decisions wisely as you build your little hamlet into a proper town and keep an ear out for the concerns of your subjects. Balance the your baronial needs with the politics of neighboring states (It's not like Civ in matters of scale). You could leave the day-to-day management to the game AI, but having been traumatized and angered by Gygaxian sadists, I decided to add these governance pains to my existing headaches. 

[b] Life in the Party [/b]

You do get to know your party members and manage who gets swapped in or out of the current roster, but you ain't getting swaps until you depart from your capital, or are at certain story landmarks. You at least get to manage your party formation in combat (so the poor wizard isn't immediately cut down by speedy kobolds with knives that catch your party flatfooted in ...what else? [i] an ambush [/i]).  Your party members have their own arcs and needs, and you'll need to squeeze in the time needed to give them the required TLC. Or you can kick them out of the party (haven't tried that, I'm not that big an asshole).

Pathfinder é um sistema de RPG de mesa que é concorrente do D&D. Apesar de muitas similaridades eles obviamente tem suas diferenças. Basicamente tudo que se procura em um RPG está aqui:
- Role play com muitas opções de diálogos
- Combate divertido (por turnos ou em tempo real podendo ser trocado a qualquer momento)
- Uma ótima liberdade para criação de personagens (apesar de aspectos fisicos serem muito limitados, as builds são muito abertas pra vc poder ""brincar"" e ser criativo)
- Exploração que te recompensa
- Bons personagens e boa história
- Uma parte de city building interessante que pode ser desligada a qualquer momento caso não queira tomar conta dela e só queira jogar a parte mais RPG do jogo.

Entretanto o jogo não é perfeito e possui alguns problemas com bugs e acho que a otimização poderia ser melhor, apesar de não ser ruim. O bug que mais me incomodou foi quando jogando no modo por turnos, se algum inimigo morre em combate pode ser que o combate trave porque o jogo parece nao conseguir reorganizar a lista de ordem de turnos com uma quantidade muito grande de personagens (isso se resolve mudando o modo de batalha e retornando para o modo de turnos, mas ainda assim pode ocasionar em perda de turno de vez em quando).
Como é de se esperar, o jogo contém MUITO texto e é esperado que boa parte dele seja lido, pois suas decisões importam no andar das coisas.

I've read alot of of the negative reviews here, and I've thought long and hard about their criticisms, and I must say alot of the negative reviews have good points. Iffy UI choices, strange difficulty spikes, sometimes confusing talent and spell structures, kineticist I'm looking at you. They're alot more to be sure, but have to say, alot of the story, combat, and kingdom management gripes are strange to me. I'm not sure what people expect from a unique hybrid that in my estimation hasn't been done before that I've seen. Isometric, CRPG, Kingdom Management, etc. It has bugs, sure, but from what I've noticed the Dev team works hard to iron the bugs out fairly quickly, and seems to be responsive. Also, maybe it's just me but I don't get excited by games that often anymore, and it takes alot for me to get into anything in earnest, and this game has me wanting to play it everyday. Often to my determent. For those of you on the fence, don't let the salty neckbeard crpg veterans deter you, just buy it and try it, return it if you must, but if you've ever played BG, Pillars of Eternity, or Dark Souls, you know the best isn't at the beginning but under blood sweat and tears, and beneath it you find a true fucking gem of a story, and great characters.

It is also fitting that a Pathfinder game specifically references Baldur's Gate in its intro. Just like how Pathfinder is a cheap knock-off of Dungeons & Dragons, Kingmaker is very much a shallow imitation of Baldur's Gate 2. As with both, however, being a lesser copy of the best is still pretty darn good, and without even playing the (reportedly much-refined) sequel, I find myself upset that Wizards didn't approach Owlcat for BG3 instead of Larian.

There's a ton of jank, the turn-based system is slower than molasses, inventory is a nightmare and the kineticist is so shoe-horned in the UI basically tricks you into burning the twins out.

-Bugs: To many to count, but the major one that almost made me stop playing, before I lost my mind dealing with other issues, is that the game slows down randomly in certain areas (not graphics issues). This causes choppy and slow movement and actions during fights, but also when you are just walking through a map for no apparent reason. I had to install a mod just to deal with it.

-Imbalance issues: Encounters are either easy or insta-death unless you metagame. Even random encounters while camping. You can wake up to a pack of worgs that trip-lock your sleeping tanks and obliterate your whole team. Speaking of trip, this game heavily favors effects that keep your characters from taking any actions while you watch enemies slowly kill your team. Encounter design doesn't encourage thoughtful tactics but instead metagame preparation and taking advantage of system mechanics. 

-Lack-luster companions: Some of the characters seem fully fleshed out and are somewhat interesting, but even with them the interactions seem stiff. Other characters are just pretty bad: bad writing, bad voice acting, poor class distribution.

Other than those, most of my issues are pretty nit-picky. If you are going to faithfully adapt a ttrpg you should probably have a copy of the leveling charts available. Huge, completely arbitrary, buffs to low CR monsters (worgs) just to make them harder than the TTRPG. There should probably be silver weapons in the game when you have monsters that have D/R 10 to silver. 

They did a lot of good with this game and I can see why some people love it, but it's not a finished game and never will be due to the sequel.

If your a casual or new to CRPG's just know that Normal is actually Hard and Easy is Normal. On Easy the game is alright 90 percent of the way through, the last 10 percent its ridiculous. I gave up after dying many times and reduced the game to the easiest settings mainly because I had had enough. I've played this for 409 hrs mainly because I had to restart multiple times from different saves because of the difficulty.

If your not familiar with the Pathfinder classes just know that in this game it leans on party composition and building a viable character. The character I built wasn't doing any damage so I had to reload a save because I wasted time just trying test things out, and because time advances in game, it also means I've lost time on my timed quests. Respeccing is free for a couple of times. Mainly my problem is all the wasted time i can't get back.

There is some railroading in this game and it forces you to move on with the story. If you don't, you get punished for not advancing it. You play at the games pace, not yours. Some quests will have a timer that tells you how much time you have left to complete it, while other quests will count down without telling you, its hidden. Failing some quests causes problems for your companions or kingdom and alters the story.

The kingdom management bit was also added on in a fairly interesting way, and was enjoyable as the small add on that it was intended to be. However, the combat system of the game is absolute garbage. You can either play it in turn based manner, which makes even trivial fights against a couple of wolves take upwards of ten minutes, or you can play it real time, in which case you have to basically give up on any advanced strategy as you won't be able to execute it quickly enough. The combat appears to be copy and pasted from the tabletop game, and even overlooking the above problem, doesn't translate well to the medium of video game, and the real time combat means that there is no reason to learn the hundreds of spells as you will never be able to react quickly enough to use them.

It really takes away from the immersive aspect to constantly be wondering and figuring out how to do any and everything in this relatively deep game. I still don't know anything about AC and what the values for Amour Check Penalty, Arcane Spell Failure Chance, and Max Dexterity mean. How to use recipes, how to upgrade a village, how to tell what day it is, how to on and on forever. It boggles my mind as to how someone can make a decent game, which is rare these days, and not have a guide to let people know HOW TO PLAY THE GAME! 
The game has WAY (UBER WAY) too many items, 99.99% of them useless. The inventory management system is a nightmare. The spells, potions, scrolls, weapons, armour, and every non-quest item is equally hellish and unnecessary and mostly useless. I used maybe 3-5 spells (out of around 150) most of the time. There are so many pointless weapons you'll never use.
After over 100 hours added to my first attempts and multiple playthroughs I still haven't been able to finish this game because of game breaking bugs. Disgusting! It's quite pathetic how many game breaking bugs are still left unfixed in this otherwise decent game. Very f uc ki ng annoying! Not buying anymore Owlcat games.

Everything this game does *feels* like it's just there to piss you off and waste your time.

Poorly balanced companions (The fact that this is a thing is incredibly annoying at this point.

Obscure Tooltip design
Encounters that almost always have something that arbitrarily extends the fight. Doesn't make it harder, just makes it take longer for no reason.
Poorly integrated mechanics that aren't true to the tabletop (sometimes it's excusable, but sometimes it's not)
Lack of QoL with commands and allies

You wanna be nice, you know? Even when a game's not so good, it's easier to just suck it up and keep playing. This mentality is the only way I can rationalize the fact that people have played this game…and liked it??

Playing this game is an abysmal experience. It is a black hole for fun. I think it’s too slow for me, but I can’t tell if that’s really the case or if I’m just so uninvested that I can’t get to the end of the experience quickly enough. Either way, I find myself always obliterating my keyboard trying to break past this game’s maximum speed like Apollo 11 trying to escape orbit, so that has to mean something. After your characters manage to slog through the molasses vapor permeating through the atmosphere, you get to fight some faceless polygon golem in a manner almost identical to actual Pathfinder. The combat is probably the second worst part of this game, but on the plus side, it’s because everything else is tied for first. Sure, combat’s not fun or anything in this game, but it’s (comparatively) quick and if you’ve played Pathfinder it’s nothing you won’t understand. They basically ripped the combat system from Pathfinder and dumped it into this game, which isn’t a problem for me. Also, when I grow to hate a character (put a pin in that) and the game finally allows me to kill them (put a pin in that too) it’s pretty cathartic to unceremoniously explode them to bits.

Now those characters bring up what I think is the core problem with Kingmaker. The devs did a fine enough job copypasting the core Pathfinder rules into their game, but when it came to everything else…hoo, fellas, what happened? There is literally not a single character in this game who amounts to more than a character trait with a mouth. I caught onto this immediately, but I keep getting gaslit by all these people who talk about how entertaining all these characters supposedly are?? And then I go talk to the barbarian again and she says GRAAGGH I LIKE AXES I CANT READ BAGABAHHHH for the 100th time. The stupid little bard child likes books, the half-elf wants to have sex I think? My favorite character is probably that dollar store Brienne of Tarth paladin. The thing that’s unique about her is that instead of having one character trait, she actually has none. She just stands in the back and sometimes says “Good job, guys!” which sounds bad on paper, but in practice she doesn’t irritate me the way she would if her character trait was religious and every 5 seconds she had to shout GRAAGGH IN THE NAME OF SIGMAR BAGABAHHHH

The writing doesn’t get much better beyond the characters. You show up at this mansion where these nobles are summoning anyone within walking distance to go fight some bandits in this unclaimed territory, and whoever can kill the bandit king gets to rule the area. Apparently the idea is that the head noble wants a political ally for a civil war thats gonna happen, which okay, that’s all well and good. I don’t know why there’s a time limit to do this, I’m sure there was some throwaway line to explain this, but its 90 days, its so big it might as well not be there. I have played this game for 20 hours and this is all I’ve seen in terms of plot. There’s smaller bits like the bandit king having a mean dad, or this purple haired little prick who tries to frame you for a house raid, but it doesn’t matter. It literally just does not pertain to anything. I thought the purple haired guy was gonna be the main antag of the first section of the game since the bandit king was so uninteresting and undeveloped, but then you just kill him in some sidequest.

Well, there is something to be covered when it comes to the purple dude. This framing bit is actually one of the first events in the game. You’re in the mansion nonconsensually talking with that snot-nosed little chatterbox bard, when the mansion suddenly is on fire now and you have to do…something about it. This is when that pig-nosed purple puck slithers up to you with this greasy little smile and is like “Oh mama mia this is-a crazy! Here, take-a this ring and make sure you-a wear it. Now let’s-a get out of here! Yahoo!” So it’s excessively clear that this chum dumpster is behind this and planted some incriminating evidence on you. Let’s kill him. Ah, here’s the rub, though; you can’t. You just cannot kill this character in the mansion, despite how hilariously obvious it is that he’s the problem. You can’t avoid that initial encounter where he picks you to be his scapegoat. You can barely even convince most of the knuckleheads in this place that he’s guilty, in spite of the overwhelming evidence in your favor. This all just spits in the face of the flexibility of core Pathfinder. I understand that Kingmaker could never be just as open-ended as regular tabletop is; those poor devs would still be programming endings to this day if they tried. But the best campaigns reward you for picking up on things early, and that just does not happen in Kingmaker. You have to experience pretty much everything in exactly the order the game has preordained - an order which I at least did not flow into naturally.

This all goes down in maybe the first hour or two of the game, and after that, you’re just left to explore the same 3 forest textures for days on end, like a forgotten soul damned to wander purgatory. It’s crazy that you’ve got hundreds of people fighting over the most boring, forgettable hunk of dirt I’ve ever seen. Sheesh, you can have it. The art style doesn’t really help in this department. Maybe it’s my fault for not playing on a state of the art homemade gaming pc with a military grade processor, but everything looks like it’s smeared with mud. There’s some more interesting landscapes displayed on the store page; you got arcane fountains and crazy crystal plants growing all big. Maybe they look just as pretty in game, I don’t plan on finding out.

I guess what’s important to note here is that I haven’t actually beaten the game. I haven’t even gotten to the kingdom building part yet, last I played I just killed the bandit king and was about to talk to the noble about it. You might say that this is a little too early to judge the game completely; it’s called “Kingmaker” for a reason. And I really can’t comment on the quality of the Kingdom Building mechanics. I know they suck in actual Pathfinder, but maybe they improved them in the game. And hey, in this second half, maybe they also improve the characters, the storytelling, the worldbuilding, the landscapes, the combat, the music, and the graphics engine. Sure, why not. I raise you this. The rest of this game could be Elden Ring for all I care. If you told me that before I bought it, but then told me what the first 20 hours would be like, I wouldn’t have paid $20 for it. I wouldn’t play it for free. You couldn’t pay me to play this trash. I’m so done.

But let’s not leave this on a bad note. This game came out 4 years ago, I’m sure there’s been time to improve. And hey, they came out with a sequel already. I still feel bitter about losing $20 to the first game, but I’ve heard good things about Wrath of the Righteous. Even other people who didn’t like Kingmaker have told me Righteous made big improvements. So you know what? I’m willing to take another chance. To see how far we’ve come. To spend another…

As someone who grew up with Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights and the like this is the modern update to those games I've always hoped someone would make, however like those games, P:KM is a dense game, with a LOT of mechanics and options, and its likely that you first character or two, or three will end in failure.

This is a challenging game, and rushed leveling up and not paying attention to character builds will see you reach a point where your characters struggle through every fight, conversely reading feat descriptions and making good use of the options you have will result in previously impossible seeming fights becoming easy.

In addition to this, their is a Kingdom building component which again, can cause a game over if you dont pay attention to what you're doing and invest time in it - this aspect of the game can be automated for those who want to focus on the combat in the game but you lose a lot of the roleplay experience and end up with a lot of downtime on your hands.

Many reviews focus, negatively, on the games difficulty.  This is a hard game, but it is fair and all combats can be won, its unlikely that you'll be able to breeze through every boss first try, but thats in keeping with the likes of Baldurs Gate / Neverwinter Nights / Icewind Dale where preparing for tough fights was absolutely necessary.   This isnt a game for those who want to approach it like Dungeon Siege, or Diablo, and hack and slash their way through.

This is a rich, vast game with a good 60 hours plus of content from a single playthrough, people who like methodical play, good worldbuilding and role playing, party building and DnD systems will find much to enjoy here.  The sheer number of classes and the ability to build your own party if you dont like the ingame companions offers tons of replayability.

The game has a very thorough difficulty options setting, allowing you to tweak and adjust sections of the game to suit, dont enjoy the kingdom building? turn on the invincible kingdom setting and ignore it!, want fights to be tougher, theres a setting for that, want things to be easier? you can change that too.

I read the same about[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous/] 
 [b]Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous[/b][/url], so buy these games on a huge discount, or buy just one discounted & skip the other (like I do...).


Here are the negatives made me give a thumbs down in the end:
[list]
[*] ""swarms""... Piss me off so bad I was close to set the world on fire. TL;DR: These 'mobs' cannot be killed but with purchased expensive stuff, while they deal permanent damage to chars' stats. So funny, right? F-word to the joker who added this... ""Worst case use a torch"" says the tip, but tried and torches deal no damage...
[*] Side chars are low, and not at all likeable. A dwarf priest which is a coward (and useless), a fighter with zero points in strength, yet with mega high charisma, trained to be a paladin but hated the way she was treated for being beautiful, so won't go paladin, etc... It's OK, I understand every background story... but 1st, Why do they go out and quest then? Go farming, or open a bar or shop, kktybb... 2nd, If they do, why am I forced to deal with this kind of trash chars?!
I could have focused on hiring mercs and boot everyone (not just the beauty and the tard) instead, but interwebs says that doesn't help with the story... Which, see below, is hardcoded... So the options are: struggle with useless idiots vs skip most of the story. Smart writing, kudos... So instead I modded / hacked / cheated around to turn these characters into something playable, as I got bored with the 'miss', 'miss', 'miss', 2hp damage fest.
[*] Alignment checks are childish. Like, I was nice with the outpost guy, but not because I'm a wonderful person, but as a) I'm gonna buy stuff & sleep there and b) I'm gonna be the lord of that place...
All in all, ""alignment"" is still a misconception in the heads: rude, ugly, dirty, jerk == evil; nice, smiling, friendly == good. If this was true, politicans would be the best folks on Earth supporting everyone and making their country great (again).
[*] Now I have a reasonable party I killed all 'the tech guys' (you will know) when we met, but the story says Kalannah got away. Interesting... A very active corpse...
BTW the same happened before when the barbarian tried to 1v1 an OP mob, which killed it in 2 hits, then the party took the mob down yet she was very pleased with herself soloing the busta... Same applies to lilhoe presenting a heroic story, while 1st, I did not-very-nice stuff left & right and 2nd, she wasn't even in my party, she joined the other guy...
What I'm saying is, [u][b]the story is hardcoded[/b][/u] and no matter what the player does and what happens in the game, the events go their way...
[*] Buy vs sell prices are cancer. I know, traditions... But how about growing up instead and set a fair price margin?
[*] There are ""zones"" in the game with different mob levels, but no indication of such. So if one follows a story line, can easily find herself in a fight impossible to win (e.g. my lvl2 party bumped into a lvl7 random encounter bandit group who one hitted all of us)
[*] When moving around, characters [u]always[/u] break formation, so if there's an encounter, it is very likely the light / armorless dudes will be in the front and tanks in the back. What formations are for then?
[*] There's a cave. You ain't see no crp in there it's so dark, so will have to play with the screen's gamma...
[*] Same cave, web trap triggered as I failed to disarm. One of the characters got stuck in it for good - yes, permanently. Couldn't make the slightest move. So it just standed there. ALT+TAB while I wait MINUTES == game paused. So one is doomed to stare at the screen and wait. The same happens later on with other traps...
Additionally, the very smart AI pathfinding will run into & trigger any and all discovered (but not yet disarmed) traps, like they didn't know it was there and should walk around...
[*] It's kinda impressive how the studio made the combat so boring I have a hard time staying awake in the epic fights...
[*] Nightmares... All it's good for one has to rest again, so the main character is not fatigued. In other words, every 2nd-3rd resting time has to be doubled. So entertaining, so much fun! Or not...
[/list]

This was the point I turned this review into a thumbs down... The combat is a very slow, very sloppy, boring miss-fest, a lot of things are very annoying and utterly stupid... VO goes away after the first few minutes and everything is text only....

Edit: Having retried the game accepting that Normal difficulty is for me and just forgiving occasional poor level or scripted fight design I still wouldn't recommend the game unless you are a firm devotee of this *type* of game.  The game tells you it is important to have a Treasurer for your barony but then makes it frustratingly easy to *not* have one and miss the few opportunities there are to recruit one at a reasonably early point in the game.

Why yes:
+Story is pretty cool, and I like the ending.(at least the one that I managed to get)
+Characters have some depth, aren't some shallow black or white potatoes. I like their development and what outcomes based on your decisions you can get.
+Voice acting is pretty good
+Graphics are decent. Actually more than decent, I really like them. Along with animations.


Why no:
- RNG. Random... number... generator... I get it that it tries to be a tabletop RPG, paper RPG, everything having a dice-roll... but it's really annoying, frustrating here. In a real paper RPG, you have a GM, who can adapt your adventure, guide you, and make it interesting even if things aren't going too well for you. Here, there is no GM, no adaptation, you either win, or you lose, and if you lose, you either die & have to reload your game, or have to lose on something, have something lock up for you. It's really not fun when you lose a persuasion check or perhaps lockpicking or whatever, fail a quest and/or lose a lot of experience, maybe some cool item - simply because RNG didn't blessed you. I liked certain other RPG where your stat either was high enough, or wasn't, you levelled that ability high enough and you got it, or not, and only thing you can blame is you. No just ""up to chance and if RNG doesn't likes you you have to lose a ton of things"".

Also, arguably it's even more annoying when your enemies highroll to no end, land blows and high-damage rolls on you, while you either miss entirely, or deal 1 point of damage because your damage-roll was trash... and it keeps on happening, over, and over, and over again. Not everything can be determined by RNG alone, and pretty much EVERYTHING is determined by RNG here in this game... the amount a healing spell heals, sometimes 3 casts, sometimes 6 to heal the same amount, hit or miss, damage, opening a chest, disarming a trap(and getting experience for it), hiding your camp from raiders, or cooking a meal!
Don't even get me started on ""saving throws"", where your enemies resist effects of your spells and/or damage, while you get CCd(crowd controlled - stunned, dazed, paralyzed, charmed etc) to no end, and lose repeatetly, all because of RNG. Because why care about strategy, good positioning, equipment, synergy, all and all, if you can't roll for shhh... can't roll to save your life, and repeatetly lose, all because rolls don't like you. Feels like literally everything is determined by RNG and nothing else here.
PS: Also, 'succeeding' at kingdom quest, is also up to a chance, 100% RNG, triumph, success... failure or disaster, all up to a dice roll.

- Dialog restrictions. You can't select some dialog options you may want, some options will always be locked for you, based on the ""moral alignment"" that you set for your main character at the beginning of the game. You want your character to 'generally' be X, but ocasionally do something Y? Nope, they are just one way, not another, can't select that option, the end. People are not pre-programmed robots!
Sure, lawful good is unlikely to start a murder cult(though could still happen since some people are two-faced liars and manipulators, but that's besides the point), but what about neutral good making a arguably 'chaotic' choice? Chaotic good wanting to make something flagged as 'neutral'? Chaotic Good, Neutral Good or something yet else, vs a logical rational choice that's marked as 'lawful'? No, nope, N.O.
WHY?!

- There are a lot of 'feats', passive perks, that you select as you level up which provide you with some bonuses. Cool right? Not quite, because some force you to stick to just one specific type of weapon or spells. In my opinion, it's plain stupid. It forces you to not try anything else, not experiment or swap for something better than you found, no, you have to choose and be stuck with that singular weapon type or your attack rolls will be worse, even further lowering your chance to do any good.

- Some locations feel pretty pointless, have pretty much nothing in them. Same goes for some 'random encounters', sometimes just one or two wolves pop up, maybe 4 bandits will attack you, causing the game to load the location, and then out of location once you're done... which wouldn't be too much of a deal, if the loading time wasn't longer than the encounter itself... and have it happen over, and over, and over.

- It's buggy, to this day there are bugs... Some of them for an example, are breaking quests and achievements related to them. One prevented me from getting one of the endings, even though I did everything 'right'... How can this be, that without FILE EDITING, you can't get one of the endings?

- Time limit. There is time limit for pretty much everything, which I personally really hate in any game, in RPG especially. I like to take my time, explore, not be rushed by anything. I get it, maybe it fits in this specific game, it's a well-thought design choice... maybe. But I personally really dislike it. Especially since some actions, take a lot of time (repeated rests for you and your companions, going back and forth, curing your squad from some 'permanent status effects' that make them next to useless, deciding to rank-up one of your kingdom stats, etc etc), and you feel like you won't have enough time for things that you want to do before the game ends.



In few closing words, I did enjoyed this adventure, mostly for it's characters and story, so I can't not recommend it, but there definitely are some flaws that make this experience quite annoying & frustrating at times.



PS: Did I mentioned about... Madrition tuuurinos! Madrition tuuuriiinnoooos! Mad-ri-trioon! TUUUURINOOOS! Emo, axi, yaas. Emo axi yaaas! EMO AXI YAAS!! (For those that haven't played the game and have no idea what that's about, every single time you cast a healing spell, the character is speaking it out loud. And both during and after the fight, you most likely will need to heal up, and will need to cast the healing spell multiple times... on each separate team member... after every single fight...

I find Pathfinder to be clunky and overly fiddly for a table top game (though, I still had plenty of fun playing it with friends!), and thought it may fare better on the computer. 

Unfortunately, Owlcat really honed in on the parts that I've always found tedious to deal with (ability damage, negative levels, etc.) and even left out some things that made the table top game feel a little better imo (taking 10, taking 20). Furthermore, you're under constant time limits the entire game, which further ground down my will to play the game. Even worse, you are regularly presented with choices that have drastic effects on your kingdom, companions, etc., without  being given enough information to feel comfortable in making the choice. With some reading online, the time limits and choices are navigable, but it still greatly reduces my enjoyment of the game.

There are a lot of things to like about Pathfinder: Kingmaker. It hits most of the important CRPG notes quite well, and the scope of building an entire kingdom is really cool. I genuinely wanted to finish the story and see where my kingdom ended up, and how things turned out for the neighboring countries and magical beings, but the tedium was just too much to make it worth it.

Edit: I tried a second time using as many mods as I could to reduce the tedium. I enjoyed the game more, but still not enough to not burn out after 60 hours and still having nearly half the game left. Would be a recommend if the game was a reasonable length (despite that even mods can't remove some of the poor design choices), but having to decide to leave a game unfinished or continue for potentially 40 hours after I've grown tired of it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1570834462,1652285173,False,57,4,0.700721085071563721,0,True,False,False

This game starts interesting with building a kingdom on previous contested lands. But nearly all NPC's are extreme cliche DnD characters, which annoys fast and wants you to complete the game alone...  which is btw not possible as most fights are very imbalanced. Either to difficult or to easy, (casters are hard to manage). (I tried to play just on normal but was still to hard, put it on easy but that became  way toooo easy). Kingdom management bores fast and takes you out of the story besides travelling around the map takes ages + thousends of boring random encounters just to reach that final destination that has to be on the other side of the map....

Most people say that the story is interesting but have been wasting so much time with all the tasks mentioned above I could not really notice much of it. I'll guess if you really like kingdom management and constantly monitoring your resources this could be for you but im going back to play some DOS2. (visually Pathfinder Kingmaker looks stunning).

Verdict: you either really like it because of the different things it is has to offer or you dont and like to stick to the more tradional CRPGs (like me)

 - memory leaks (saving and loading sometimes just takes forever)
 - the occasional crash to desktop
 - story points sometimes not clear enough
 - 10 archers just gunning down your main player character
 - unclear flanking notification
 - unclear attack of opportunity threads
 - pressing space to fast when wanting to accelerate a move, then just skipping the full turn
 - occasional miss click of death
 - the occasional random full move, even if single move was specified
 - No way to craft magic items
 - are there even silver weapons in the game? 
 - Even more lag in menus
 - Missclicks because of lag
 - Item pricing that just feels wrong, like really wrong (sell for 10K buy back for 300K like WTF)
 - 50 day warning that the main quest will fail, 60 day unlock event to finish it

Edit I had some time during a crash to desktop

 - The thing that really pisses me off. The lock breaking and secret stash finding mechanics. Rolled a 1 on your lockpick attempt? Well sucks to be you come back after a level up and try again. Forgot where the chest was? Well sucks to be you more. Same is true for secret stash rolls. Bodged perception rolls to find one of the hidden rare forgeable items? Well sucks to be you even more.

Is it the fact that there are lengthy sections of unskippable dialog, albeit optional for companions? Is it the really expansive world map that is restricted to being explored for 3 months (in game) or else you fail if the main quest is not completed?

I'm going to put in another few hours and assess this game once I get into a decent battle rhythm where I have decent loot and as interesting as I can get party. Not really liking that there are so few interesting male companions, but at least the female ones are written decently. 

I would suggest playing better CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, where you have a strong diverse caste of companions, unfolding main story (not intrusive), and a overall better balancing for combat (because you can always come back to it later when properly prepped).

It's a very good CRPG with interesting companions, so content rich it feels like it could have been split into two if not three games, an amazingly in depth recreation of tabletop rules and such a variety of character builds it's insane. 

The main story is so-so, but the world and characters in it are interesting enough to keep you going. All the companions are enjoyable and have fun backstories and offer something new to both the combat and roleplay spectrum. 

The Kingdom mechanics are a mix of Dragon Age Inquisition style advisor solutions and multiple cities to do base building that influence your overall Kingdom levels in certain fields like Military and Loyalty. 

Conversations and ""Story book moments"", (which are like choose your own adventure segments), are very in-depth and let you use various abilities and things you've learned to your advantage, so having abilities is useful not only in combat and skill checks, but also various conversations. I think these choose your own adventure segments help this feel even more like a tabletop and get some things in that an isometric CRPG couldn't really get in gameplay wise otherwise.

Graphically I'm a big fan as well, a strange thing to comment on but the day/night and especially weather in this is outstanding, the way the maps change to accommodate a lightning storm compared to a warm morning or light rain is so cool.

After having spent 90hrs into this, I'd tell you not to get it, and I sorely regret that I have to say that. Why? Read the below rant if you're interested.

The game started wonderfully, the mechanics easy to grasp and the story compelling. As a fan of ttrpg Pathfinder and DnD, I loved the atmosphere of the game, the choice driven storyline, the charming characters and the subplots they brought to the experience. The battlemaps and environments are well-designed, with plenty of terrains and secrets for you to scour your entire screen every time one pops up. I loved the travelling mechanics as it feels like a real ttrpg experience, especially with the little conversations popping up among party members, setting up roles for everyone when camping and even the surprised encounters.

Sounds great so far, right? 

Yeah well, a good playthrough only started after everything you've worked for to a certain point of the game is completely wasted and broken down. The game takes longer and longer to save the longer you play. The difficulty setting is out to punish you and your innocent level 3 party if you want to have a bit of a challenge (how is having the entire group of mobs critting every 3-4 hits against the players fair in any way?). You can't chose to avoid mid-travel encounters if combat starts. Play a rogue? Lol, sucks to be you, because there's no available mechanic to set an ambush on the road. 

The game actively encourages you to collect all available party members, yet, regardless of how good your choices are for the entire group, forces you to choose between certain members at the end. There are characters in the party AND in the game that are impossible to save, because they are written to die. Certain members would outright leave your party due to a single choice regardless of the story build-up before that. Which brings me to the most frustrating part of the game: the over world timed mechanic. Certain quests, especially the main questline, forces you to follow a very tight timed schedule. This severely affecst your ability to resolve all characters' questlines, unless you want to dedicate all your time to them and ignore everything else that can compliment the main quest. 

In order to have a ""perfect"" playthrough, you're expected to follow a very strict choice set with NO wiggle room. This includes having to manage your time precisely down to a T, bringing a certain set of party members to certain quests, letting certain NPC's die and making very careful choices with dispatches. And STILL, certain beloved characters will die, no matter how much you've invested into them. The end story arc is messily written at best, with several bugs and frustrating encounters.

tl;dr: Game has great potential, also great at giving the illusion of choice and gaslighting players into thinking their decision matters. Full of weird bugs that are never addressed (as far as I can tell), may crash constantly, constricting timed quests and heavily roll-favoured the enemies in higher difficulties.

I don't recommend this to anyone who's never played a CRPG before, because it will whup your booty in ways that Divinity will not.

D&D 5e and Pathfinder 2e players will also probably appreciate it, though you'll forever be reeling at how much got stuffed into Mathfinder - I mean, D&D 3.75e.

A few general tips for playing:
* Use acid flasks to kill the spider swarms in the first cave. This is literally the first thing that screws everyone unfamiliar with Pathfinder's ruleset.
* Don't be afraid to play on Easy or use the considerable difficulty adjustment settings. Seriously. This game was designed by min/maxers and I'm pretty convinced that the computer cheats, especially at later levels.
* The turn-based combat mode is cool but remember, this was designed for real time with pause combat, so there are dozens upon dozens of trash mobs. By the end, I was only using turn-based for important boss encounters.
* Get a Bag of Holding as soon as possible. Or if encumbrance is annoying you, just grab the Bag of Tricks mod and turn it off. In fact, install that mod along with this game, because it'll make some of the more obscene encounters waaaay more manageable and you'll want it for saving your butt when you accidentally piss off one of your romanceable party members beyond redemption.

The developers behind the game engine managed to do a really good job creating the foundation of a great world just to have insanity poured into the story/dialogs by a bad case of a militant feminist infection. You can feel a great story that had all key elements twisted out of shape due to a personal agenda…
Characters in power are exclusively women, if not, you are either meant to kill them or watch them meet a horrible end.

The antagonist (for most of the game) is a women surrounded by women advisors. The entire core of the story is a women having been victimised by a “male”…

If you wanted a believable and reliable defender/vanguard as companion… think again… characters like Edér (POE) are beyond the reach of those “writers“. The barbarian is a women fighting tribal sexism and The paladin, also a women, follows the god of ART cursing her beauty acting like a bitch when complimented.
As for Male companions… if they are not openly gay (as in constantly putting it in your face), they have been purposefully crippled in mele combat without the ability to mitigate the damage via respec.
Since the XP is finite and a large portion of it granted via companion quests, you are indirectly forced to those narratives.

I gave up mid game, tired of unimaginative and cringy stories. My second playthrough went better when I promptly aborted these horrors by bashing their skull in and leaving them on the side of the road early game.

I've been GMing Pathfinder 1e for years and love CRPGs in this style. This game though after that first honeymoon phase? Utterly disappointing. Legitimately the only solace I'm taking out of this experience is that I normally aim for $1 or less spent per hour invested in a game, so like I hope to get 60 hours out of a $60 game at least. Before I gave up, I had gotten $0.50 per hour invested out of this game, and only because it was on sale. Aka, 40 hours at $20 spent. I didn't even come close to finishing this incredibly long game (130-190 hours, according to HowLongToBeat.com). I wasn't even close to a third through it because of problems detailed below.

Here's a tl;dr summary of my points:
1) Lack of polish
2) Poor difficulty presentation
3) Major mechanic (kingdom-building) not presented until well into game, not even a fun mechanic
4) Writing is all-around awful
5) Choices are limited/unclear/frustrating

First off, there is a ridiculous lack of polish. From the clunky UI/UX (skipping turns, not clicking, clicking something else, telling you that you can move and make a standard action then not allowing you the standard action), to the egregious amount of typos that are somehow all over the place yet still left in the game with no editing fix in sight, it's truly amazing to me how many people are giving this game high ratings through this. I understand this is their first game and all, but wow. Just wow.

Second, the presentation of difficulty is upsetting. As I said, I've GMed Pathfinder 1e for years, so I understand the system pretty well and the mechanics are virtually identical sans being morphed to CRPG format. There is no telegraphing of difficulty, however, as a GM would provide at the table (hopefully). Some things feel like I've been forced into higher level content too early and I end up having to save scum just to survive because there is literally no way out of some of these encounters, or there are encounters where you can literally be incapable of dealing damage and get TPK'ed, sometimes with the autosave right at the start of combat! If I have to redo something a ton of times, I hate it. If I have to reload to a save before something and come back, fine, but does it become recurring? That's a game problem. I can turn the difficulty down, but I genuinely wanted at least the average challenge. It's not like it's me either, because I normally play games on the hardest difficulty with self-imposed restrictions at times for the sake of it. I enjoy difficulty. This game is just awful when it comes to balance, telegraphing, escape/retreat options, and other things tied to the general concept of an enjoyable challenge.

Third, the game is called Kingmaker. It's based off an adventure path in the tabletop where you start a kingdom. I understand that doesn't happen right at the beginning of the adventure path either, but when I buy a game that involves a deal of kingdom-building, I kind of expect it sooner than like 15-20 hours in. I would have liked to have experienced it in the like the first two hours maybe, so I could have also realized it's nothing like the tabletop system at all. I would have immediately refunded the game right then and there. The system of kingdom-building in this game is terrible. Extreme periods of downtime while rushing against timed quests is just unnecessarily punishing at worst, boring as all can be at best.

Fourth, I'm sorry, but the writing is terrible. The story is just plain awful. This feels like a 13 year old wrote the campaign and all the dialogue. I kind of expected professional tier writing and not the experience I could get at the local game shop. At least the faults of the local game shop GMs are due to a single-person, amateur, labor-of-love operation. These folks got hired and paid to write this. Boo! Truth be told as well, trying to read the dialogue while the voiceover is playing is majorly distracting since the emoted descriptions of certain activities (e.g., gestures, facial expressions) obviously aren't read aloud.

Fifth and finally, it's pretty much been a staple in RPGs since like the '00s that certain choices have major impacts on the story or branches of it, at least the world in some capacity. I love that. BioWare sold me on it easily back in the day. In this game, none of those branches are obvious and it's disturbing to me you can, for instance, ruin an entire romance questline by choosing just one single incorrect dialogue option without even a warning. In fact, some of the dialogue options in the romance questlines aren't even obvious and you can fail to progress it by merit of legitimately roleplaying how your character would respond. There are extremely limited alignment options, sometimes being forced to choose between something like only Lawful Evil and Chaotic Neutral options (no alignment-less options) when you're a Lawful Good character. There are certain branches of dialogue where saying something removes other branches without warning (I HATE this with a burning passion in any game, not just this one). Sometimes the choices are based off the most limited information (unless you Google, which removes the fun of playing the game for me if I have to do it a ton), like who to pick as your envoy. All of this combines to me feeling like I have to research every little dialogue option I make at some points, and y'know what's great about that as well? This game is so poorly documented online in that regard, despite being out three years. Bethesda games seem to have an army fixing up multiple wikis. Maybe it's the strategy guides for those games helping? I don't know, but I ended up giving up on a lot of this and just chose dialogue that suited me for the last half of my playthrough.

If you made it this far, know that I actually considered purchasing Wrath of the Righteous, because I thought, ""Hey, maybe it's just because it's their first game."" Then I tried to play the Beneath the Stolen Lands DLC as a standalone just to make a min/max character I thought would be fun, to redeem the system and convince myself this was just a one-off personal experience with this game (I REALLY wanted to like it and the company making it). After three hours and rebuilding my party five times, I quit. I will never buy another Pathfinder video game, I will never buy another game from this company, I will stick to running the tabletop where the builds make sense and can be fun. Do yourself a favor: if any single point resounded with you, don't buy this game. Don't buy into the hype. I didn't buy Cyberpunk 2077 either, and returned The Outer Worlds within an hour of playing it. Maybe it's that modern RPGs and I don't get along, but I'm so disappointed.

1. too many bugs. most of them do not break the game, but still disturbing and sometimes means 1-2 hours wasted for solving them. This is not a new (4 years have passed!!) game, so there are no excuses for it.

3. Unlike other similar games (such as Divinity), most plots are fixed (In order to achieve goal A, the only way is to do B, there are no options C\D\E for you to complete your goal). NPCs cannot be attacked or interact with until you are allowed to do so. You have some freedom to do errands, and you can choose whether to spare/kill somebody after specific missions (missions are designed to be independent to each other, so your decisions do little changes to other missions), but that is all.

[i]Pathfinder[/i] means: This is the ultimate min-maxer ruleset. If you come from less rules heavy RPGs, you might make the mistake of thinking ""hey, I like warriors. I'll select the fighter class, give them a lot of, uhhh, strength and health and be happy"". No, sir, no way. This will end in frustration if you go even average difficulty. And it isn't helped by the fact that the other party members have horrible, inefficient leveling strategies and terrible stat distribution, too. You've been warned. Luckily, you can select the easiest difficulty or run the cheating mod ""bag of tricks"" (for example to have enough money to respec your char if you find you made a mistake).

[i]Pathfinder[/i] also means you're going to encounter the ridiculous old D&D alignment system. It is used quite well (evil alignment decisions are not completely stupid, as is lawful good), but it can easily become the often criticized roleplaying auto-pilot (""I want to say 'A', but 'B' is the right answer for my alignment"").

[i]Kingmaker[/i] means that you're forming a kingdom. With lots of management. And stressful decisions. 
And a completely different game to learn. You can automate that completely, but you'll lose out on a lot of fluff that way, so don't.

[i]EE[/i] means this is the enhanced edition. This game has seen changes, a lot tutorials are outdated, it has a bad reputation that some conversion paths and developments are really hard/narrowto navigate. Most of that is gone. This is a good thing. Still, this is a computer game build by humans with limited time. So when you build a really complex character builder and a kingdom administration game on top of an RPG, some things will fall short. Like level design. You'll find the same level reused quite often for side quest areas.

Yet I like it. There is annoying stuff, but there are interesting characters to meet, good dialogues and a solid main story. Actually, this is why edited this review after playing some 80 hours more: Boy, they are good with their stories! The character arcs for the companions are great, the copy on the items is lovely, the in-game books are good and even the kingdom events and their result texts are lovingly crafted.

But if you're a narrative guy like me, ignore any guide that focuses on ""best possible ending"" or try to hit all the nice achievements. And do not go for the ""one savegame only"" mode: While this helps with sticking to your decisions, which I consider a great roleplaying tool, the outcomes are occasionally surprising and still not what you want.",1647938907,1650977292,True,14,0,0.658573389053344727,0,True,False,False

640820,102814409,76561197977811566,0,10,7921,0,7518,1640095912,"Of nearly all of the modern CRPGs I've tried, this one is the best. Better than Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, Torment Tides of Numenera, Divinities, Shadowruns, Solasta. The only exception to this is Disco Elysium, but that game wrestles in it's own category altogether.
(Note: I haven't played Wrath of the Righteous yet, so this opinion may yet change.)

I've often felt that the more modern (3rd edition onward) iterations of DnD would be more fun on a video game than on the table, and this game seems to bear that out. It really feels like a sincere translation of the modern TTRPG experience: the extensive character building, the tactical challenge of combat, the character development power fantasy of 1-20 (ish, I only managed to get to lvl 18 by the end), combined with an enjoyable adventure story, world exploration and fun companions.

The scope of this game is immense and ambitious, which gives the game a great sense of adventure. You're given a relatively huge map to explore point-crawl style. Time passes during travel, and camping, lending to a certain amount of verisimilitude for the world, as the main quests do come with time limits (though the time limits never seemed particularly oppressive as long as you're prioritizing the order in which you do things).
The camping system in itself is the best I've seen in any CRPG; you assign party roles for watches, hunting, cooking, hiding the camp. Random encounters can take your camp by surprise, especially in more dangerous areas. This is an important part of a TTRPG adventure to me, and too many CRPGs opt to turning resting into some kind of an automatic heal-button, but not this game. Your companions even have small conversations during camping, which adds a nice bit of flavor. It really does feel like taking a party to an adventure, much more so than any other CRPG I've played.

The gameplay is classic CRPG fair of party based dungeon crawling and tactical combat. The main difference maker here is that Kingmaker lets you switch between turn-based and realtime with pause on the fly, which is something I hope every modern CRPG does from now on. You can use real-time when you know a few on the fly commands combined with party AI will get the job done, and turn on turn based for more challenging encounters that require more granular control of what your party is doing.
Those challenging encounters can be very challenging indeed, and the game does have some difficulty spikes that may feel jarring. Frequent saving is advisable because the game does not pull its punches. I do think many people are overstating the difficulty though, I never really felt like I was sucker punched with a completely unfair encounter, and I never had to revert a significant amount of progress due to difficult encounters.
The combat is some of the more satisfying CRPG combat that I've played, mostly owing to the faithfulness to the TTRPG system. There's a wide array of tactical choices at your disposal, and the game tests your knowledge of it's systems regularly, though it doesn't always present information to you that well.
I do have to say, though, that at times the combat encounters can become somewhat of a slog. Some dungeons are quite long and consist of a lot of repeated encounters of defeating groups of the same enemies one after the other. The pacing of the game could do with some tightening, and though I appreciate it's immense scope, it doesn't really need to be as long as it is.

The main story is fun. It is nothing groundbreaking to be sure, but it sets a good stage for your exploration of the Stolen Lands, and the journey itself is satisfying. A lot of it is pretty classic fantasy stuff: trolls, owlbears, fey and kobolds and the like. Personally, I've come to appreciate the more classic tropes like this. Dialogue gives you a nice amount of options of using your skills and stats for certain dialogue options, and the game gives you nice freedom of roleplaying the kind of character you want to be. Each companion comes with it's own set of quests that resolve throughout the lengthy game, and most of them go through some nice development.

The Kingdom Management will be an acquired taste, to be sure. It doesn't feel tacked on exactly, and I wasn't annoyed by its inclusion, but it is also not particularly deep and I can definitely see how some players might it gets in the way of the actual adventuring content. There is an option to let the game handle it, I didn't test that option out so I don't know how that affects the experience and whether you end up missing some content if you do automate it. It was an interesting experiment, and definitely suits the story this game tries to tell, but it doesn't completely hit its mark.

Overall, this is a robust and faithful TTRPG experience in a video game format, and the most worthy successor to games like Baldur's Gate out of the modern offerings. The game is incredibly ambitious and I'm shocked at how well it succeeded in what it set out to do.",1636964875,1650915204,True,123,0,0.866999924182891846,0,True,False,False

Kingmaker has some shortcomings, most pointedly obscene difficulty spikes and a laundry list of bugs, but these issues paled, to me, in face of a surprisingly engaging narrative with a great cast of characters. The game goes on for too long with the amount of meaningful story elements it has, but the first half especially has some good to great side content laced in between to keep the pacing fresh.

I can really only recommend this if you have the attention span for RPGs, and even then, I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a first experience of the genre. Nevertheless, most especially considering it's the developer's debut and a Kickstarted game at that, this one is up there with Shovel Knight for me, in terms of developers exceeding any and all reasonable expectations.

Pros:
+ Has good sense of writing the story, narratively, but lacked a good main story itself.
+ Some lines got a nice voice-acted (usually the important dialogue one is voice-acted). Regardless, it's a nice additions to a kickstarter game.
+ Kingdom management system is superb. Kinda mixed of Pillars of Eternity and Dragon Age: Inquisition, but with more depth and complexity to overcome.
+ Plenty of class, races, spells, mixed this with that, explore all you like as long you understand what you're doing.
+ The companion quests is (for me) better than the main story itself, lol.
+ Chunk load of story branching and ending, also achievements for replay ability.
+ Can be challenging at time.
+ Plenty of quests and things to do.

Cons:
- Unforgiving rules (It's an improved copy of D&D 3.5 rules). So it's very not friendly with newcomers to the genre.
- You need to do that whole-a-lot-to-read to understand how the games work, plan your build, et cetera. Which is time consuming and overwhelming, apart from reading the story itself.
- Missing essentials feature (auto controlled AI like in Pillars of Eternity, for example).
- Missing few must-have key-binding.
- RNG-based dice rolls is suck ass.
- Locked Isometric camera.
- At mid game, kingdom management system feels rushed and becomes the primary thing that defeat the joy of RPG (exploring). And they do throw at you problems after problems while you have to improve your kingdom and doing quests at the same time.
- World building doesn't have the right grip to be a believable thing (unlike Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire).
- Poor design of explaining how the games works.
- Few non-gamebreaking bugs.
- The game is not fully optimized.

You are hired by Lady Aldori to take the fight to the Stolen Lands where you kill the stag lord, the current bandit lord ruler of the stolen lands, and upon his death you become a crowned Baron. Along the way throughout the whole game you find a significant number of companions, each with their own stories and backgrounds that also play a critical part in how your kingdom is run. As you play through the game your choices and kingdom decisions play a huge part in how the game ultimately comes to an end. 

The Kingdom system in this game is done in such a fantastic way as your subjects constantly come to you with issues leaving with you a number of choices on how your kingdom is going to be run and your critical choices determine what your end game kingdom is going to be like; whether you create the holiest of holy kingdoms or a kingdom ruled by what might as well be Asmodeus himself (or much worse). Events, projects, and choosing the construction of your buildings in your cities as you claim more territory throughout the world mapare just some of the awesome things you have to worry about as you rule your kingdom with each new chapter in the game also revealing a whole new crisis you have to contend with and discussing with your advisors on how to handle it.

Another awesome part of this game is it has a huge world map leaving a number of areas with interesting encounters in them that if you manage to beat then you get the rewards that follow. There are, however, many dungeons as well and each has it's own historical significance that actually gives you hints and clues about past empires and sometimes foreshadowing possible enemies as well.

As you progress eventually you will go to war with other major factions such as trolls, barbarians and even neighboring kingdoms as well that want what you have and depending on how well your kingdom is doing will ultimately determine how you play out in these wars so make sure to make choices that benefit your armies, your people and garner their loyalty.

One big flaw I hate about this game though is the balancing of battles. Often times your going to find yourself going up against encounters that are so difficult out of nowhere you have to keep reloading your save until you have figured out the best strategy on how to defeat your enemies and unfortunately there are many of these in the game. A lot of enemies in-game have crazy AC bonuses that are just given to them by the developers and are not inherited bonuses from armor or magical gear like they would be in pnp. So a lot of times you're waiting for your companions to finish off that one last guy and can't land a hit because he's buffed to hell with magic and ac and you have to watch as he slowly kills off your whole party by himself which is very frustrating.

One last note: some really fun mods for this game, such as Call of the Wild and eldritch arcana, give you more options on designing your character by giving you more archetypes, magic items, spells and even new classes you can play which I highly recommend giving a shot as it will add to your experience. I highly recommend giving this game a shot. The game can get unfair a lot of the times but I highly recommend giving it a shot regardless. It's got a great story and kingdom management system for it!

This game actually has one of the best collection of difficulty options I've ever seen in an RPG. You can really customize the experience you're getting. But if you just blindly crank it up, then yeah, you're going to run into encounters that you basically can't beat unless you skip them and come back in a few levels. And for some people, this is infuriating. For me, that's WHY you pick a harder difficulty in an RPG. Crank it too high and every single encounter becomes an exercise in pain. If that's for you, more power to you. If not, just give your ego permission to not feel bruised by not playing on the highest end of the difficulty slider, and you'll be fine.

What salts me out the most, is how good the game could have been if not for the forced time pressure, and intentional punishment for engaging in Kingdombuilding.

- When you return to the main menu, there is an unskippable 5-second animation as the menu options rotate into view and are illuminated by a light source that turns on. During this time, the menu options can be clicked, but because they are moving it is very easy to click the wrong option and have to sit through 2 loading screens before you can try again.
- There is about a 1 second delay between pressing the hotkey for selecting a party member and the party member actually being selected.
- There is no hotkey to swap between weapon sets (so if you want to open with a ranged volley and then switch to melee, you need to manually click the weapon sets of each individual character)
- The hotkey for switching between characters does not work in the inventory menu - you need to either click their portrait with the mouse or exit the inventory menu, hit the hotkey for the next character, wait a second for the game to realise you want to switch character and then hit the inventory button again.
- The combat UI has a number of docked boxes with a few sets of rare actions that need to be pressed with the mouse (no hotkey available) and can be closed by hitting ESC. However, for some reason this does not apply to the weapon sets menu, which needs to be shut manually.
- There is no hotkey for stealth.
- Whenever you cast a last AoE spell (e.g. Grease) it is very difficult to see the area that is affected by said spell.
- In turn-based combat mode, there is an option to make a 5-foot step only, but not an option to move max the distance in one move action. This means you need to fiddle around with very precise placement of your cursor and if you make a small mistake then an extra 0.1 of a ft. of movement just cost you your standard action. This is infuriating as there is no undo option and you just lose your turn.
- and a few more...

There's a lot to like about Kingmaker.  The premise of building a kingdom in a forsaken land while desperately juggling competing demands is fantastic.  You feel the Sword of Damocles swinging above your head with each decision, and there's never a moment where resources feel abundant or decisions feel trivial.

But this thing is unplayable.  It's common to get trapped in permanent failstates and have to start the game over.  If you go to the forums, you'll read that the real game begins after everything breaks and you have to restart from the beginning, which seems more like Stockholm syndrome than a rational opinion to have about a crpg that takes over a hundred hours to complete.

My first permanent failstate was when the savegame system exploded seventy hours in from trying to track every item in every corpse I had created.  This made saving the game take several minutes; I ended up bringing a book to read while it saved, but the problem kept getting worse.  After a few internet searches, I learned that there was a cleaner mod that fixes this problem, but it requires revisiting every area to clean it.  I gave up after a few hours of unsuccessfully vacuuming the game back to life.

I should have had enough sense to drop Kingmaker after that, but I was invested in the story.  In my second run, the permanent failstate was going through a portal which crashed the game and created an error message.  I tried reverting to an earlier savegame, but it broke again at the exact same spot.  After several hours of internet searches and opening up the savegame files I was unable to fix the problem.

The game is absolutely huge, with the main story spanning many years as you claim your kingdom, build it up, watch it burn down, and build it up stronger again. The writing can vary, as you'd expect in a game this big, but at it averages out to good, with some memorable moments that absolutely shine, and the major characters (companions and villains too) are all engrossing or horrifying in equal measure.

Its one of those games that is so big that its actually kind of hard to play through it all without putting it down and coming back to it.

I've got 20 years or so of tabletop experience so I was prepared for a complex (but hopefully rewarding) character creation, and to paraphrase Mortismal Gaming's review I believe that if you put the time in that there are some fun builds to try.  Unfortunately the game is so buggy and long that at 200 hours I've yet to finish my first playthrough and am honestly losing the desire.

The issues I have include but aren't limited to: needing to know beforehand or lose access to key party members, poor pacing (months of kingdom management anyone?) and some truly janky encounters (thanks to poor auto saves I've just lost half an hour to an hour of progress at craft knife or w/e it's called with the insane ghost ambush).

Honestly I want to like it, the world seems great, I like the character interactions and overall I'm happy with the party members. It's not enough when you're continually set back.

For the record I'm playing on normal with effortless kingdom management (down from normal across the board) with turn based on - but if the developers think that this is normal they should check the number of people who haven't finished it.

Pathfinder Kingmaker though, is a hit and miss for me. It's not so enjoyable due to how the game mechanic handles your opponent against you.  

Beginning of the game comments you and your party as “warriors who gather to claim the stolen lands” but until you reach lvl 4, almost none of your attack will hit a chapter 1 enemies. If you are reading the battle logs WHEN you manage to survive an attack, you will notice that enemies in this game will roll die at high value all the time and never low but vice-versa for your party. In any tabletop RPG, if you roll lower die than your opponent, you will not miss, but deal less damage instead (like the status ""reduced"" instead of a continuous ""Miss"" for 5 consecutive time). This is the main reason I would not recommend this game. 

A regular bandit can just berserk and critical hit your tank and melts her almost instantly before you can even finish a spell cast. A supposed instant skill “Charge” that were meant to instantly go towards your enemies to get the agroo from your other party member, need a timer before it was used inside combat. And by that time it was casted, the enemy is already kissing you, chipping at your hp and cancelling the skill cast instantly,meaning you just wasted a turn.  

Die roll in this game is already very obnoxious. You roll to either hit or miss, you roll to either land high or low damage, you roll to either save on reflex, damage reduction, initiative etc. This is also the main reason why your party will miss their attack even on a giant monsters like trolls or elementals, as if they are Goku from Dragon Balls with fast step while just sitting there just because they have high AC (Armor Check) when they literally naked with no armor. 

I do not mind the timer put in quest, to get the sense of realism in any video games. It makes sense that if you took too much time doing anything else, something bad can happen to you, people around you or if you are a ruler, the people you rule over. In Pathfinder Kingmaker, this is a very huge hindrance, especially if your camping time is random enough to either pass 1 hour or 15-17 hours without having your team status debuffed or exhausted just so you could ""memorize"" (restock/refresh usage) the skill/spell again even though you already know it. It is that random, as if the time for you to rest is determined by a die roll as well. This will make you to drop anything you are doing and rush to save your kingdom to an inevitable doom. 

The AI in the game are by far the worst AI I ever manage in videogames, CRPG or tactical RPG. You told them to hold yet they just charge on ahead because of input delays,sometimes just the AI saying ""Im not listening to you"". You were meant to select 1 character while you have the whole party selected and deselect them instead. Sometimes your party member will take the longest route to reach their destination or facing your enemy in combat, or stupid enough to find the shortest route running through grease or web that was casted by your party member while the enemy themselves have the AI that makes them avoid the grease. And that doesn't count how they ignored it through their will saves die roll which they often do. Not only that, when a party member detected a trap, unless you turn of their AI, they will still step on them when combat started even though the whole party already know the trap is there. I literally slapped my forehead when this happen. 

In the version I originally play before I write the review, we as the character was introduced with a tiefling character Kaessi. I was confused because the version that I originally purchased did not have the Wildcard DLC yet I met her during the prologue at Aldori Mansion. Then as I progressed through the game, I did not met her at all even after I received barony when I already know that she was suppose to show up during the ceremony of your barony. She was suppose to be a DLC companion yet even after you purchased the DLC afterwards and reload your save where you dont own the DLC, she wont show up at the ceremony but after the 2nd act begins when you are already trying to solve the Troll troubling your barony, making it harder to manage the timer on your quest. Hence forcing me to replay the game from the start just to get the her companion quest to start normally. This is a bad move just so people would purchase the DLC. Never show a DLC character at the beginning of the game when they werent suppose to be there in the first place.

And while we are at it, lets talk about the size of Pathfinder Kingmaker's Save File size. Its enormous, we are talking Megabytes size per save and on 1 character. The amount of saves you can have for how many decision you need to make unless you want your kingdom destroyed and a force game over, can reach to Gigabytes alone. Im only on Chapter 2 during the ""Troll Trouble"" chapter and my 1 save from that already reached 20Mb alone, and I only have about 10 manual saves, that totalled to 200Mb. 100 saves? thats 2 gigabyte. That is because the game have an encumbrance system where if you carry more than necessary it will encumber your party as a whole, meaning you have to leave these loot behind. Those loots and dead body of the fallen enemies stays throughout the game with the exception of the Stag Lord area being remade to become your barony, clearing everything that was left there, making your save files cluttered with junk. An old unoptimized method of saving a left behind loots even when Diablo back in PS1 era already made a cleaner smaller save encryption for it. Plus there is no mass save deleting mechanic. You need to select and delete the saves one by one or close the game and delete it from your PC folder directly.

For how bad my experience is playing the game, the story, lore, party personality, banters and characters build are interesting enough for me to keep playing. Plus, the world itself is beautiful to explore if you are not gated on time sensitive quest. Either way, there are just not enough to justify a beautifully crafted story and world with hindering mechanics that would just wipe your whole team in an instant due to unbalanced enemy stats and high rolls while your party never roll decent. I am not usually save scum my way to get decent result in games, but in this game, you are forced to do so, just because how low your roll at every single decision you make. Be warned.

I've rewritten this review 3 times now. The first draft was over 2 years ago and was a pretty strong recommendation (thumbs up). Then I ran into a game-breaking bug that Owlcat has known about and didn't fix./ Since I truly dislike poor support, the review as changed to a thumbs down. Now here we are a few years later. I managed to play the entire game without hitting game breaking bus. So what's the 3rd verdict? 

Pathfinder Kingmaker is a throwback to the days of Baldur's Gate RPGs. Of all the RPGs released in the last 15-20 years in that style, this one seems to evoke the most feeling back to those old BG1 days - which is both good and bad. They've done a fair job of implementing the rules of Pathfinder - as well as I can determine - in this game with classes, skill checks and even the lore. This is truly a long, table-top type campaign in computer form. There's really two games here. One is the grand story, where you go from place to place on the map, adventuring and solving quests - quite often by combat. There isn't one contiguous map but many small areas that you travel to and explore. Some of them are quite small and a handful of the maps are larger but none re massive. The quality of the areas are fair, with decent graphics but often little inspiration and some small maps are reused constantly. They're competent. You scout from zone to zone, camping along the way, entering new maps and seeing what's going on. While this is happening the grand story is happening, which so far has been quite good. Without giving any real spoilers, you're granted an area to lord over but there's a curse on the land that you uncover and then have to figure out.

The other part of the game involves managing your kingdom. This requires you to build up towns and cities by selecting buildings (needing building points, which you get a trickle of but can buy more with gold), even selecting new city sites, annexing lands, addressing events that frequently occur in your kingdom, etc. There are ramifications to these decisions, so choose wisely. It's a different take on building up your keep/castle found in similar games and I applaud the ambition of it.

Pathfinder is complicated and there's very little hand-holding in the game. This game expects you to level up your characters and there are almost unlimited decisions you can make. Hundreds of spells, traits, multi-classing, weapons, skills, feats and the like  make this a VERY complex game. I don't know modern D&D rules very well and I'm always having to look up guides on how to level my characters or how a trait might work. The interface is okay but it's not hard to miss something like actually picking your new spells. The kingdom building is basic but even that sometimes isn't well explained. For instance, I didn't know how to level up my village into a town. It turns out that you have to have 3 cities, wait for a ""project"", research that project and then presto-chango it's upgraded. You'd think that it would be available on the build menu but it isn't. And there's almost no help whatsoever about what to build in each city. There are literally dozens of buildings and each building provides a small buff to your overall kingdom stats. Some buildings get bonuses for others so proper planning is good. It's truly, seriously disappointing that the cities I build I can't then walk through. When you go to one of these towns it's the same as every other. Since the building is on a grid system with pre-defined spaces, it should have been possible to dynamically add the buildings to these maps for a more immersive experience.

The NPCs are pretty good. They have interesting back-stories, their side-quests are some of the most fun in the game and they're really well voiced. Yes, there are romance options. None rise to the level of some of the better Bioware companions but it's fun to get to know them and they're not always what they initially seem. 

The graphics are quite nice and most of the game is lovely to look at. Sound is decent, though the music gets repetitive. But there aren't any real complaints here beyond I'd have liked to have seen some more interesting maps. I will warn that there's a particular map area late in the game that's annoying as heck to navigate because it essentially exists twice. My last game almost died there due to frustrations with the navigation.  

This game was rightfully raked over the coals for technical issues on release. And they still remain, including the aforementioned game-breaking bug. Owlcat just decided to stop supporting it and moved on to Pathfinder: WotR (which is better game) but it irks me that known game-breaking bugs were never fixed. Shame on you, Owlcat.

So far I've been less-than-impressed with the DLC. I bought all 3 parts and the only one I really know I've come across are the Tenebrous Depths, which is a very underwhelming dungeon crawl in an ugly dungeon. The other two you have to choose separately from the menu rather than being integrated into the game. And by the time I was done with the main game, playing a little mini-DLC campaign wasn't appealing. My advice would be to skip the DLCs and save yourself the money. 

Itemization in this game is pretty good. There's a lot of +1, +2 type of stuff and later one a bunch of more interesting type gear. But you're going to have to earn it because you generally can't buy the good stuff from most vendors except in ONE temporary map. But by the time you're done you'll be swimming in interesting gear. 

The game suffers from very uneven difficulty. First, you better create some good characters (which I've already mentioned is tough to do given the complexity of the Pathfinder character system) and even then you're going to run into some fights that are really, truly difficult. Unfairly so. You might be on a quest in a dungeon, facerolling the entire thing and then stumble on a boss fight that you simply can't win. Now I'm old so I don't care - I just turn down the difficulty to ""story"" and that allows me to get through crap like that. It's a bit of a tactician's game and if you're not into that then you'll also turn down the difficulty. And I have to admit I played the last 15 or so hours like that because I was truly fatigued with the title. I wanted to see it to the end but I also wanted it to end. This game overstays its welcome a bit. 

Frankly, there's a lot more I'd like to say about this game, both good and bad. But I'm getting up against the word count so let me wrap this up. The reason I compare this to BG 1 is because that title, while a classic, had a lot of rough edges in many of the same areas. BG 2 came along, smoothed out the rough edges, made the story far more expansive and a classic RPG experience was born. Pathfinder Kingmaker is EXACTLY like that as Wrath is simply a better game than Kingmaker in virtually every way. The growing pains that are obvious in this title pay off with a better experience in the next one. So this is recommended for fans of the genre but preferably on sale because if you're going to pay full price, you'd want to get Wrath of the Righteous instead.",1578329146,1650138118,True,0,0,0.456033289432525635,0,True,True,False

The art direction, especially in the character portraits, is absolutely phenomenal, and it's insane how many of my choices came back later in the story. Despite some shaky first impressions, I grew to really like and care about my companions. The combat is incredibly solid as well, especially being able to switch between turn-based and real time with pause on the fly. I massively prefer turn based in general (and helps with spells and abilities) but being able to switch when the fight was dragging or something very easy was great! 

I only really have two complaints for this game. The beginning can feel a bit unfair; a lot of encounters are incredibly dangerous early on since your toolkit is severely limited. Secondly, the ending felt like it was dragged out. I was ready to be done a few hours before the final chapter started. Not helped by the fact that the dungeon before that was a bit tedious and frustrating.

Every battle I had was as follows - quicksave, attack, die, quick load, try smth else. <- this is your game loop btw. There were games that do it to some extent, but for instance in Divinity: Original Sin encounters are more of a puzzle, and ramping of difficulty is actualy predictable. Here devs just gave impossible AC, stats and resistances to everything and say 'fuck you'. Especially early on you are ill-equipped for challenges ahead, but you may think that later on it is better - but no, it just gets worse. I didn't gave shit about the story, characters or anything because i was constantly frustrated and i was quicksaving and quick loading like a mad man.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is an excellent RPG, with a deep story and a big emphasis on player choice, consequences and different paths. Like any old classic CRPG, you form your party with pretty unique characters and embark on a looong journey to defeat a grand evil, stopping along the way to do various side quests and exploration. 

The combat system and classes are extremely complex, more so if you don't know the actual P&P Pathfinder rulebook. On normal you can get by without understanding everything that's happening, but on higher difficulties you need to have a grasp of how all interactions play out or else you will not have a good time. 

The game is long and can sometimes feel tedious. It combines the aforementioned RPG mechanics with a kingdom management system that feels a bit of a hit & miss. It has its own calendar, with time limited quests and a span of 3 to 4 years of in-game time, so the story plays out over quite a bit of time. 

Being so dependent on the P&P ruleset means the game has A LOT of RNG, and when I say a lot it's almost unbearable. Some combats can vary drastically with the result of a single dice roll controlling whether your tank gets mind controlled or not. Save scumming is expected (and even encouraged by the devs).

If you're a fan of PF or 3.5e and all the ""stuff"" that comes with that, you'll enjoy this game. 
If you're not a fan of PF or 3.5e and all the ""stuff"" that comes with that, you probably won't. 

You'll have hundreds of options to pick from. Only a few will be worth it. 
You'll have to optimize your pre-planned build from the beginning, or it'll be tough going.
You'll be shoehorned into certain choices in the game, or you'll probably die.
So on and so forth. 

I like the game. It has a lot of good things going for it. But it also suffers from most of what keeps me away from playing Pathfinder at the table: it's a whole lot of extra fluff that just distracts from the core gaming experience. 

The game throws A LOT of extra stuff at you. And usually, I wouldn't mind that. I love city management and kingdom building mechanics. So I don't even mind the town management part of the game. But it's all... pointless. Like it doesn't really matter what you do. But you have to do it. That's weird. 

I don't mind the timers. Timers are fine. But there are some timers that you have to go out of your way to find out about. Why? Why not just put a warning on the UI that you have to complete X by this time? 

I'm not a munchkin type, but I like tactical games. I like being able to overcome a battle with a non-optimized party through tactics. But this game seems to demand certain characters have certain abilities by a certain battle or haha F* you! Why? 

It's just a lot of baffling design decisions like this. There's a lot of a feeling of playing the game the devs want to force you to play rather than playing the RPG the way you want to play it. It's the antithesis of the old BG games.

In many ways, the game requires you to put aside the ""fun"" part of things and succumb to what the game wants you to do. It's similar to how Pathfinder classes have one clear optimized build and if you don't take it you're simply hurting the table (despite supposedly ""way more options than 5e etc etc""). Here, you'll think there's tons of options in front of you for the first several hours of the game. But the more you get into it, the more you realize your choices are really locked or you're just hurting yourself. 

It's not a bad game. And a lot of the complaints are overblown. The kingdom mechanic isn't THAT bad. It's just kinda pointless. Travelling all over the damn map isn't THAT bad. Except it doesn't really matter - you have to go where you have to go anyway. It's a lot of fluff with little payoff.

Difficulty:  I want to preface by saying I am not new to CRPGs/tabletop D&D style games. With that being said, this game is so inconsistent. You can get 80% through a dungeon just to be killed by something that felt more like a ""surprise MF!"". For instance, you tactically bring an enemy to a choke point where your party can ambush them. You position your characters strategically during fights and put the tank in the front and have mages/rangers in the back. You carry on for a while and during the next fight, you're about to kill the last enemy when all of a sudden you get swarmed by 5 other enemies that flank you from all sides. Now your having to try and re-position everyone but you get hit by opportunity attacks and there goes the mage. You have your cleric try to heal your fighter but the cleric goes down while channeling the spell. Slowly but surely, your party goes down 1 by 1 from enemies that shouldn't have killed you in the first place. This wasn't once or twice either. It happened so many times that I eventually put the game on story mode just so I wouldn't have to put up with all the BS. At this point, I was no longer enjoying the game because the combat didn't feel like combat anymore. 

Lack of direction: There is a fine line between leaving something for the player to figure out and just leaving the player clueless. I had to read the journal several times to see if I was missing something but could find no extra information. I had to blindly travel/investigate back and forth just to end up right where I started. Many times, I found things by complete accident. 

Kingdom Management: The idea is interesting but the implementation was horrible. You have to send advisers to take care of issues, but those issues take months of in game time. Yet, you are continually given more issues to take care of one after another. Since your advisers are already assigned to tasks, you have no more advisers to assign to these new pressing issues. Thus, you fast forward some days just to move the progress along on previous issues so you can start another task when all of a sudden you get ""Game Over. Your kingdom has failed."" This is when you are reminded that you have main quests that you need to take care of or your kingdom will fail. So you go to take care of that quest and then a teammate says ""blah you said you would help me with X quest but your not, so I'm done with you"" and they leave. Now, you have to reload a save from a while back to stop the current quest your on to help them with their quest losing all the progress you made before you reloaded the previous save. You do this only to find out that you have people waiting for you in the throne room awaiting your presence, but you can't visit them because you're already having to juggle between 3-5 different things you wish you could take care of all at the same time, but you can't. Imagine you're in the middle of a circle and around the edges of the circle are babies. You need to tend to them all but you can't move them from where they are. If you don't tend to any one of the babies for a period of time they will die. When you tend to one baby another starts crying. Then when you go to tend to that one, another starts crying. So you constantly run around from one baby to the other trying your best to juggle them all. This is what Pathfinder Kingmaker felt like to me, not just the kingdom management, but the game overall. It didn't let me create my own pace. It forced me on a certain pace that I couldn't deviate from. 

World Map: The most annoying part of the game. I understand that they want you to find your way around the map but this is not it.  It constantly makes you go back and forth between 3 or 4 points to uncover all the routes to and from a certain destination. The problem with this lies in its current fatigue system. You cannot travel very far because your party will get tired and need to rest. Traveling around feels so tedious that I want it to hurry up and end instead of getting the feeling of anticipation/joy. Meanwhile, so many days are passing by in game time but the party is hardly moving from point A to point B. At the same time,  kingdom management is throwing all this crap at you that you need to tend to. This felt so frustrating and was NOT fun.

Way too much Combat: Sarcastically speaking, did I buy this game so that I could play an ARPG like Diablo II? Seriously, the whole point of tabletop CRPG games is the journey. Yes you have encounters but it's spaced out properly. This game felt like wave after wave after wave of enemies. This caused another problem with having to camp all the time just to get ready for the 50th time in the same dungeon. 

Overall, this game was NOT fun. Usually when I play games, I end up saying ""oh, that's dumb"" at least once about something. When playing this game however, I found myself saying ""this is so stupid"" ""wdf why"" ""how is that even a thing"" ""so freaking dumb"" and things along that nature several times every time I put the game on to play. There was never a single time when I could just get lost in the game cus something about it would just be so hellishly annoying and dumb. This is why I had to eventually quit. I tried so hard to get lost in the game but the game itself keeps keeping me out. I guess it's my fault for playing better games before playing this like POE I/II and DOS II.",1625080273,1649724097,False,37,1,0.752587318420410156,0,True,False,False

Did I enjoy the game? Absolutely!
Did I play for over a hundred hours happily? Yes.
Will I have fond memories of this game? Yep.
Do I want to do another playthrough of the game at some point? Yes
Will I muster the will to put myself through this again? God no.
Will I recommend it to friends? Definitely not.

To put it simply, this was one of the most enjoyable, exciting, tedious and frustrating games I have ever played. For the first three or so chapters my relationship with this game was in its honeymoon phase. It could do no wrong. The story was interesting, I was already planning what I would do on another playthrough. Some people don't like the kingdom management, or the timers, I don't mind either, really. Most of my favourite games are management games. The moment those mechanics unlocked I was enthralled. This game was the best thing I have ever played.

The next chapter started to dampen my mood, you see, I hadn't unlocked a new companion in a while, and I knew there were more as I hadn't gotten the achievement. So I did something I normally didn't do and searched it up, just in case something had bugged out... And I had missed them. For those who have played, you are probably aware that you get two of the companions in one encounter. The only thing is, the event that allows you to get them is random and only fires in the first chapter. Sure, there is a high chance of it firing, and I saw very few people with the same issue as I had, but indeed on my first playthrough I had been locked out of content because of a dice roll that I had no idea even occurred and was not based on any choice I had made.

""Okay,"" I thought, ""That is irritating, but I can try to enjoy the rest of  the game."" I continued on, only to realise a short while later that one of the companions I missed is one of the only characters who can take the magister advisor position. In fact, they were the best possible option. That was a little frustrating to learn, but hey, that is still the same issue as before. Only the game has the strangest system of arbitrarily assigning characters to advisor positions.

So as an example, and trust me this is not the only one, lets take a character you meet in chapter 2, a reclusive mage, eccentric and solitary, he moved out into the wilderness in order to perform dangerous magical experiments.
So, you might reasonably think that, once you get the option to recruit him, that he might take the role of Magister, the advisor in charge of the magical affairs of your kingdom. Well you would be wrong. He is a diplomat or treasurer...

Uh... What?

Literally nothing you learn about this guy hints that that is what he should be. Hell, his advisor portrait has him casting a spell.  Honestly I could rant on this point for a while, but a lot of strange restrictions like this ruin any form of immersion and just feel like you are being limited for gameplay reasons, not story reasons, which is not great in an RPG, in my opinion.  

Now I could go on with a million tiny gripes I have with this game, and that is the issue. It is so difficult to point out anything definitively wrong, but these tiny inconsistencies and problems build up to make the experience increasingly frustrating and I only hope I can convey some of that in writing.

So lets move on to one of the larger issues: Alignment. Now let's be honest, the alignment system has never been perfect in any system that has the Lawful-Chaotic, Good-Evil axes, and the game is only working with its source material in that regard. But this is one of the most baffling implementations of it I have ever seen. Half the time when you see an alignment choice in dialog, you are left scratching your head, going, ""That is Lawful Good? Don't I make the laws? Why can't I make better laws? The game doesn't know what codes or laws my character follows, but why that assumption of all the possible assumptions?"" or ""If that is Evil, why does the other option seem so much more morally just?"" Once more, this feels like it is a writing problem.

Speaking of writing, the game is lucky to be resting on the shoulders of one of the most popular and respected Pathfinder 1e modules, and that is where it gets a lot of its enjoyable writing. The questionable writing is constantly present though. The most egregious example being some of the companion quests, Valerie's story in particular, but by no means exclusively, stands out as incredibly bad. Spoilers below.

[spoiler]The whole plot goes on about how her past in a religious order led her to hate the abusive dynamics of the group, and how restrictive they were to her freedoms. Then, long story short, the goddess she previously worshipped gives her a massive facial scar for fighting back against one of the members of her order coming to take her back without regard for her thoughts on the matter. (This is canonically one of the good goddesses in lore, btw) She later goes on trial for leaving the faith, and her scar disappears in front of everyone, proving she is still the chosen of her Goddess. And what lesson does she learn from this plot, you might wonder? Well when you speak to her afterward, she says that she realises that she shouldn't have been so angry at them for their beliefs...[/spoiler]
WHAT!? Seriously, who wrote this companion quest? I worry for the morality of the writer themselves for not seeing what they did there.

I could honestly write a lot more, but I hope this gives an idea of the frustration that this game causes. The saddest part is that under it all, this is a great game, it uses the tabletop system it is based on well, and you can feel that the devs were fans of the source material, or at the very least did their research. At points it really does feel like a tabletop campaign. If only it didn't feel like such a chore to actually play. If only the writing didn't drag it down and make it feel that much less enjoyable.

However, the game also lacks balance and is plagued with a few techical and conceptual bugs that, combined together, risk to ruin the fun at multiple points during the playthrough, a problem that for sure has driven many players away from it (but the frustration can be mitigated by adopting a few precautions).

Overall, I feel like recommending this game (despite its flaws), for the following reasons:

- Great character(s) progression, very rich, customizable and very faithful to the ones found in real tabletop RPGs (Pathfinder, in this case).
- Great combat mechanics, with a lot of effort put on the importance of preparing and managing battles through spells and buffs of several kinds, on the variety of available spells and weaponry, and on the importance of choosing the right party for the right battle/campaign.
- Battles can be played both in real time and in turn based mode, with the possibility to switch between one and the other at any time, even within the same battle.
- During combat, the player can decide to control each individual companion, or instead to focus on her/his own character and allow the AI to control the companions (this too can be changed anytime, even in the middle of a battle).
- Interesting combination of adventuring, exploration and kingdom building/management throughout the gameplay, though the last part feels at times seriously flawed and it could be done better.
- Balanced progression of the difficulty in combat situations during the game... at least in normal mode. You often get the impression that your party has just the right amount of power and strenght to barely overcome greater and greater challenges, provided that victory is never granted and that you have to put some thoughts and effort in the management of your characters/party.
- Very rich and LOOONG storyline... for sure this game can keep you busy for dozens and dozens of hours (probably just finishing the game acheaving the minimum targets requires already more than 100 hours...).

The things I didn't really like about the game are instead the following:

- Akward and unclear kingdom management mechanics, featuring a chronic lack of flexibility in what the player can actually do beside appointing companions to governing positions, with strange, annoing and illogical limitations and rules.
- The roleplaying aspect in dialogues: it is sometimes very hard or impossible for your main character to act and take decisions according to her/his chosen alignment, with some forced choices that, in some cases, can have serious consequences for either your character, or the evolution of the storyline, and in some other cases will simply cripple you gameplay for good, unless you betray your alignment.
- Very unbalanced progression regarding the management of your kingdom through advisors and throne room events. The pace and difficulty of these challenges can jump from relaxed and easily manageable to TOTALLY CRAZY and plain out of control in the blink of an eye. Given that failing to keep your kingdom in good shape can bring your campaign to an abrupt end at any time, this is by far the worst part of the game, in my opinion.
- Bugs! And I mean, lots of them, scattered a bit everywhere (interfaces, maps, even in the settings). The more you play, the more likely you are to see strange things happening, for example items missing from where they are supposed to be found (or where they already were, like your inventory), spells that do not work, characters that get stuck in the most bizarre situations, objects that you cannot collect from the ground (but that are enlightened as such), etc, etc, etc... Even sometimes settings that do not get properly applied to the game (or that randomly change on their own), such as the AoE pointing method, the camera controls, etc. There are also a few conceptual bugs, for example dialogues that at times are not fully coherent with previous choices/events, though these bugs are less serious and far less annoying than the technical ones.

To summarize, this is an interesting, challenging, sometimes frustrating game made by a young company that shows inexperience, but also a lot of good work and potential for the future. 
To properly enjoy this game, gamers should be ready to SAVE A LOT OF TIMES while playing, reserving a lot of saving slots (from the settings menu) for both autosaves, and quicksaves, and be ready to ""rewind"" the game to the last ""playable"" state when things go wrong... and they can go really, horribly wrong, quite often, actually!

I must add that the game becomes more enjoyable the more you get to know its hidden mechanics, such as time counters for solving quests, the importance of solving specific kingdom management problems in time and to boost your kingdom stats by ranking up your advisors, etc. In short, playthroughs following the very first one are more enjoyable, once you know better what is critical for the game.",1649536029,1649536029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story feels like an epic tale spanning across the years in which you face threats and challenges gradually revealing the true nature of the ominous forces that threaten your lands.

I came to this game without knowing much if anything at all about the Pathfinder system. Though the first few hours were a headache, the game mechanics are comprehensible and offer a wide variety of possibilities. Speaking of possibilities, the role-play aspect is marvelous. I recommend using the Bag of Tricks to remove some alignment based dialogue restrictions.

The pacing is very good until the last few hours. The last chapter (excluding the secret chapter, which offers an incredible final boss) is a badly balanced mess, which is a shame because it is the culmination of the story and by far the prettiest dungeon in the game. By that point, you just want to get to the end and face (or not) the powers behind the events of the story.

The kingdom management, though very interesting during the first chapters, eventually becomes tiresome. I recommend you choose the ""easy"" difficulty setting for the management to avoid neglecting it completely (especially since messing up the kingdom can END your game).

Graphics are quite good for the genre, and more modern than the ones copy catting the old Baldur's Gate look.

My greatest concern is around pacing. This game took me much longer to complete than I wanted it to.

I think for people that don't play Pathfinder tabletop, the odd adjustments to many things and the overall lack of feat support is probably fine, but even with mods there's an exceptionally large amount of content missing... much of which is very much felt.  I don't understand why core archetypes like Mutation Warrior, Eldritch Guardian, and so many others are absent.  It's not like these are unknown or from obscure sources, they're among the most popular and commonly used archetypes available.

But that doesn't really bother me very much.  CRPGs always take liberties with the source material.  What *does* bother me is how utterly incompetent Owlcat are at creating a game where precision is even possible.  AOE indicators are *not* precise at all.  This *will* lead to Grease, Web, and other core early-game control spells hitting allies, or allies walking into them even though no part of their circle or model touched the visible AOE.  There's zero justification for not having precise AOE indicators!  If you can't manage that, then you shouldn't be making a game.

There's so much more.  You can't take 10 on tasks that you will succeed - you have a chance of botching that DC 15 check with a +10 modifier because you rolled low... except Take 10 is a thing.  A thing that is *inexplicably"" absent.  Take 20 is also absent.

Effects like Grease and Web don't end upon combat ending, which is okay... except there's also no way to cut buddies out of the web or grab a pole or rope from your pack to help them cross the Grease, like you would do in tabletop (you could also just simulate this by giving people automatic Take 20's/very slow movement with no chance of getting stuck/falling outside of combat or crisis situations.)  So what happens is, you throw out a web in a combat to control the enemies (because Web is and always has been an important and powerful low level spell in D&D), and then you *literally walk away from the computer for several minutes* because Web has a duration of minutes per level, you can't cancel it early, and the game lacks any sort of time compression, ""wait an hour"", or similar option.

It's a bunch of relatively minor things that, taken together, completely ruin the experience for me and really makes me wonder if Owlcat did *any* playtesting on this game at all, or if they had idiots that don't know how to play Pathfinder playing or something.  Did literally no one use Web in any of their playtests or something?

It's a shame, too, because when the game isn't being a pain in the ass, it's a lot of fun.  Graphics and sound are pretty good, music is decent to good, and it's Kingmaker - the characters and story are fun, and I actually *like* the way they streamlined and simplified some of the kingdom management aspects.

But for me, I can't overlook the constantly frustrating and annoying elements to this game.  I'm kind of curious if, like Obsidian did with Pillars of Eternity 2, their Wrath of the Righteous game improves on the crappy UI and presentation but I'm not willing to give them any more of my money to find out.  Paid $15 for Kingmaker on a sale and I still think I paid way too damn much for what I got.

Owlcat needs to hire people that actually know how a proper UX is supposed to work.  With how important AOE spells are to Pathfinder, there's zero excuse to not have razor precise indicators for movement and effect sizes.",1648826556,1648826556,False,0,0,0.437956184148788452,0,True,False,False

After spending 76 hours playing this game I had to restart multiple times because of random problems like my party refuses to move, or one of my characters or the enemy characters gets stuck on a turn and just can't end it, or the most obnoxious one of all - savegames get corrupted on a regular basis, without having to use mods, there is no detection mechanism and there is no fixing this unless you manually edit your savefiles where you actually have to search for the thing that breaks the save (could be multiple reasons, most often it's items/skills/feats that get corrupted) and you need to manually remove it from the save. I am a datascientist by trade so I am used to digging into massive data files and this was still a challenge for me. Oh and you save can break, and you might not even know about it until dozens of hours later when you visit the area that has been corrupted and your game just crashes. Mine was such a case, my savefile got corrupted on about hour 15 and now on hour 76 I have no other choice but to abandon the game because there are no working fixes for my specific case (unfortunatelly I do not get the id of the corrupted Blueprint in my error message so I can't even search for it in my files :) ). I will post links to some of the threads I found. Play at your own risk, just know that you might be extremely disappointed when you realise you played for nothing after your save gets corrupted, if I could I'd get a refund just because of that as developers don't even seem to acknowledge this problem.

Correction: There is a way to deal with those monsters that I listed as having ""immunity to all martial attacks and single target spells"", there are a very few ways to get around their immunity, but the game in no way gives any hints as to these methods that I have found.

My advice to get the best out of this game: Read up a little/ watch a youtube video on it first as its got some very complicated systems, and set aside a good chunk of time for character creation.

The gameplay is solid, easy to learn, and faithful to the Pathfinder tabletop version, allowing a lot of character builds. The story is clear, easy to follow, and doesn't bury you in endless lore dumps to accomplish worldbuilding. Companions and important NPCs are interesting, varied, and voiced well all round.

It has a lot of neat elements to it - very involved character creation, neat premise, decent writing, decent party NPCs. Honestly, something of a blobber - pretty heavy on combat. There are plenty of interesting options in fighting through the game, both in combat/party approaches and in terms of options you get for addressing combat/problems - some 'story' fights in the campaign can be altered favorably/unfavorably depending on choices made during the storyline, and some fights can be bypassed completely. 

I was pleasantly surprised by how often there are alternatives available where you might ""think"" there should be - don't think charging through a fort's gates is a great idea? Find the side entrance. Found the big boss' pet/secret weapon? you can deal with it in advance as you see fit, sometimes. Decisions made earlier in the campaign(s) can help or hinder you as you go, NPCs can join you willingly, be induced to join, or bail on you if you're taking too many liberties with their trust (you can also expel them from your entourage as you see fit with minimal repercussion). 

There is a city management element that other reviews seem to have mixed feelings about - can be tweaked or turned off entirely via options, personally I didn't mind it. There are a ton of little things being tracked behind the scenes that add up towards your end game result - the final form of your kingdom and its legacy in the epilogue. Without spoiling anything, your character needs to survive in order to ensure your kingdom survives, and the reverse is true too.

Specific to combat and character creation - while some character classes are better than others, on standard difficulty you can get away with pretty much anything; you can also hire your own companion characters if you find the story NPCs are lacking, dead, or dismissed from your retinue. One thing to keep in mind is there are instances where your main character will have to fight alone, so whatever you play, make sure you have a plan B in case you're compelled to take matters into your own hands. Enhancing your characters with magic effects and debuffing the enemies is 9/10ths of the combat, particularly towards the end of the game, which can become tedious and occasionally has some really munchkin-ish moments. Spells like Grease, Glitterdust, Blur, Displacement, Slow, Haste, are must haves and get tremendous mileage.

Careless ommisions and game breaking oversights.

For instance there is no hotkey for weapon set swaps and no ability to assign weapons to
hot keys. Everytime you want to swap from misslle to melee you have to open the weapon set panel slider and click the set you want to use. This routine will have be repeated for each character you want to swap. So if you're like me and want to take maximum tactical advantage of missle weapons you can expect to spend most of your time switching weapons because there is no group weapon swap either. .

ALSO the character selection hot keys don't work!! Meaning everytime you want to select a character to give it a command (or perform the round to round click chore I detailed in the last paragrap) you have to take your mouse out of the action and click their picture at the bottom of the screen.

The game gave me 7 alchemist flasks (AoE fire) to counter them. They didn't even kill the first swarm in the dungeon. I died on the second. Couldn't hurt it.

If you are similar or like me, than you will want a build that can easily stomp its way through maps. Something powerful and offering you all the choices to achieve the best ending. Well, I have done all the research and played the entire way through the game. Are their more powerful? Perhaps. This character however, is able to solo the final fights of the game with ease, and little to no preparation.

Bugs.
Bizarre hidden time counters that put a lot of pressure on the games flow.

I think fundamentally this game would have been better with a bit less going on but better developed.

Overall its a fun Baldurs Gate like game in a lot of ways and if you can tolerate its quirks you can enjoy it. I just eventually lost patience with it and decided to move on to more polished experiences.

One thing that this game does really well is converting the tabletop experience to a video game. There are many, many choices, big and small that players can make that have consequences on the world around them. Kingdom management is actually quite fun and engaging from someone who was skeptical about that. The classes and leveling up are all super fun and interesting, the mechanics of switching between real time pause and turn based combat at great, and with lots of community mods, there are so many fantastic options for characters, way too many to be honest, with almost unlimited characters available for creation.

The only thing that I will say as a detraction is that the game is probably too long with too much content. I'm not sure how long my playthrough will be but it probably will clock in around 80-90 hours (with some mods to speed things up). I have seen people online say they have 200 or 300 hours in this game. Sometimes fights or exploring areas or dungeons can really feel like a slog or extraneous and parts of the story feel a little disjointed. Sometimes I feel like the game could have cut back on some of the content that's not really necessary and streamlined. I think the main advantage of a game like this is replayability and that is hurt by the length of the game, as personally I would prefer to play three 30 hour games with three different characters/builds than one 80-90 hour main quest.

But some people I'm sure feel the opposite and it's not my game or my design :) So all in all a really fantastic game, lots of fun and I do look forward to replaying eventually.

Edit: Last chapter of the game and ending is pretty disappointing, just feels like a huge slog rather than fun. Really hard for my party composition, almost impossible. Disappointing ending to an otherwise great game

The game mechanic is extremely annoying, cheap, and unnecessarily complicated. Players tend to do reloading a lot. Everything in the game is gambling-oriented. No matter how good your party stat are, dice rolling can always ruin your experience if you do not save regularly. For examples, opening a chest can always fail even though you have put all points in learning how to pick locks.

Preemptively out-of-fight buffing is vital as you will not have time to do so during the fight. However, the game is designed that sometimes enemies will be spawned into your face or behind your back, without any indication. Therefore, when the incident happens, you have to reload so that you can buff your party in advance. I personally strongly consider this design very cheap.

Some enemies in this game are also cheaply designed and equipped with stupid skills. Some can kill you in one hit unless you buff your party with one specific spell of protection first (lame). Some can destroy your stat harshly just by standing next to you (Mandragora).

Skill trees are boring, especially those of melee classes. It entices you to use only one type of weapon, because it will be the most effective. Moreover, the final ultimate skill at max level is lame, and it is being copied & pasted throughout all classes.

HP in this game means nothing. You cannot tank enemies using your toughness. You can only tank by only not being hit. Thus, classes with skills that improves HP are considered inferior and sub-optimal. In addition, ironically, a character wearing a full armor and a shield is less tanky than another one wearing a cloth. This design is illogical and defies fundamental Physics (even in the standard of fantasy game).

The explanation of game mechanic is horrible. Everything is described in dice-related numerical system instead of using decimal. I fully understand that this game is based on a table top game, but interpreting dice probability into decimal percentage is a proper thing to do. Moreover, some skills are vaguely explained as it relates to the terms ""hit dice"", which is practically a size measurement in game. Some skills can only hit a creature with the specific size. However, players have no way to know the size of each enemy. Even googling will not help much.

In summary, the game is quite good but also quite bad. I think the bad parts outweigh the good ones. So, I do not recommend it. In my opinion, Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 are much more enjoyable.",1647533573,1647540670,False,2,0,0.527870774269104004,0,True,False,False

Time limits being the absolute worst...even switching on the auto management for the kingdom does very little to eliminate the frustration of the timers.

Instead of making a game with a plot you WANT to follow, they half-*** a plot and slam a timer on it to MAKE YOU FOLLOW IT and their way to the detriment of.

Won't even go into balance issues.  Even things that in real pathfinder couldn't hurt you can wipe the party, thanks to an apparent inability  of an NPC / monster to ever roll low and the player to ever roll high.    Patches didn't help, oh they fixed small bugs (usually ones the player could use in their favor) and left the bad designs of timers and lack of balance intact.

For tough fights, switch to turn base to control all the unit's actions, otherwise leave on RTS and let the AI control the NPC members of the unit.

One serious suggestion and one complaint: Suggestion first, the developers should have considered using inanimate cut scenes for the storyline instead of animated interactions (lots of down time waiting on unnecessary animation). I would have received the same benefit from simply seeing a 2D image of the speaker and hearing/ reading the text. 

Speaking of unnecessary, the constant need to stop and rest and suffer through the unnecessary animation was infuriating after awhile. This is not to suggest fatigue should not play a role, but the 'rest' feature should have been a click and an outcome not an extended and unnecessary interaction between all the characters. This has been commented on by many others.

Plan to spend a lot of time in the Stolen Lands. 

I recommend the “Varnhold’s Lot” addon and perhaps “Beneath the Stolen Lands” (but only if you like dungeon crawls). “The Wildcard” add-on is nice for the tiefling race and companion story, but I found the Kineticist class too different for my playstyle.

Anyone not familiar with the pathfinder or D&D 3.5 system should set the difficulty to the easy setting to avoid being monster chow too many times.

If you know your basic pathfinder rules and like turn based combat, then I recommend the challenging difficulty. Depending on your party composition you might get a hard fight once a while (I am looking at you, mandragora swarms), but overall nothing too frustrating and no weird character builds needed. 

The uneven timing forces you to concentrate on the main storyline in some chapters when you would rather take a leisurely stroll to do some side quests and has you doing kingdom events and twiddling your thumps in others.
Kingdom management is pretty basic, but regular saves in case of unusual accumulations of disastrous rolls are still recommended.

Don’t spoil your experience by reading guides to everything. Just some important advice…

Don't spread your skill points. You need specialists! (Especially with Trickery, Perception and Persuasion).
Have some redundancy for your party; don’t count on having every character available all the time.
Money is no problem. Spend it! Don’t finish the game with 2 million gold pieces and 9000 BP.
Teleport circles are important; don’t dawdle on raising your barony stat (arcane, after you get to divine IV).

If you are indecisive like me, install the Respecialization mod.

It's very noodley in many places and has a habit of forcing you to get every single buff you can possibly get to even stand a chance at progressing in the game, and even when you get them all the dice can easily decide to fuck you in the ass and just throw you off a cliff. That can often result in you getting destroyed 6 times in a row, only for you to reload again and suddenly instantly kill everything in the encounter in the first round. Some people may consider this bad game design and that the game is WAY too punishing in a lot of ways, such as the aforementioned buff stacking being mandatory, but its also satisfying to watch a 15ft tall barbarian smack the shit out of a dragon with a sword that is taller than she is.

However, for all its faults in terms of learning curve and difficulty, it makes up for it tenfold with the story and characters. Getting to know each character is such a fucking journey, getting to know why they do what they do, why they are the class that they are, where they came from, how they think and why they think this way, then getting to complete their personal journeys and seeing their conclusion and their own personal experience with it, and how they feel about those conclusions - all of this is an unforgettable journey in itself, aside from the main story. It does such an amazing job of showing you every side of every conflict in a way that makes you genuinely feel something for characters and the world they live in. Some characters will first make you think, ""wow this person is awesome!"" only for you to find out more about how they got where they are and think ""holy fucking shit I actually had no idea who this person truly was."" while others will make you think about how much they have grown over the course of the game.

I loved how the game looked and how it played but the characters and the story just didn't matter to me, for some reason.

No idea why but I didn't care for any of them, at all. The game looks pretty and polished but I couldn't bring myself to progress because whatever happened just flew over my head. I didn't like any of the squad mates, I couldn't relate to a single character, therefore I didn't care what happened to them.
Cool-looking models and extensive character customisation just aren't enough for an RPG, unfortunately.

I guess a lot of it also had to do with how obvious your choices were in every single situation. Most of the time that would be a good thing but Pathfinder just turns it into a math problem instead of a natural interaction between the characters. The alignment map is the only thing that matters when you speak. It just comes to ""I say good-lawful, character X gets mad; I say good-chaotic, character Y gets mad. Question: which character do I want to appease more?"" And there are games that utilise characters' alignment much much better. I played them.

You also can't randomly do evil stuff if you've a good alignment. Like the fact that I was saving everyone around should somehow matter when I decide to loot people because I had a bad day. No, you ought to have ""evil"" points for that. I've a crossbow, I don't [b]need[/b] ""evil"" points. You can subtract ""good"" points for that decision but don't force my hand.

A tacked-on gimmick at best.

It is not the type of RPG you'd expect of a video game. Garrulous, yet imprecise. Lots of flavor text, not enough explanation to how the abilities and skills you're taking actually work. Loads of classes, all of them functionally identical to each other. Requires wiki and google to be up at all times to be even remotely playable to anyone not already heavily invested in Table-Top Pathfinder. 

It's closer to modern XCom than any other RPG out there. Yet the RNG is even more ridiculous than in XCom, where you might miss a 95% chance to hit 20% of the time, but at least you'll hit more than you'll miss. Here, a 20-sided die will roll less than 10 almost every time, while enemies commonly have enough armor to require a roll of 15 or higher. This can be easily seen with a pet Smilodon -- it attacks 5 times right out of the gate and it's rare to get more than 1 of the 5 attacks to roll more than 10. The game even tells you on-screen, in plain sight, the result of each of the 5 rolls! In all my time with this game, it hasn't landed 3 of its attacks more than ten times and I used it all the time as my vanguard! [b]The game is blatantly playing with loaded dice.[/b] Which is really the final straw.

And that's not even saying that this game has more bugs than The Elder Scrolls and the devs have essentially abandoned it to work on the sequel. The bug that pissed me off the most is that my turns would get eaten in turn-based more. The game would tell me that I can take an action. I would take the action, but the game would do nothing and instead tell me that my action was already taken.

If you want a better cRPG, check out Wizardry 8 instead. It's much better mechanically, even though the third act is quite unfinished due to the company's impending bankruptcy.

A lot of this is standard fair to anyone familiar with the tabletop- obsessively plan out twenty levels of character skills, feats, and spells in order to have a functioning party (or just look up a guide). Paperwork out of the way, I enjoyed 240 hours of story, character interactions, puzzles, sidequests, kingdom management, and gameplay. But it all falls apart in the end.

What presents as the final dungeon is a slog where little happens narratively, gameplay is reduced to near endless waves of status effect enemies I hope you've built your party specifically to counter, and a repeat of a previously used puzzle for even more padding. Upon finally fighting the boss, you're presented with yet another level of enemies to fight. All choices, all gameplay, all narrative gets funneled down to one tortuous, linear mess. 246 hours in and I'm done with this. I'm uninstalling and not bothering with the last (after the last) quest. What a chore. I simply can't find a reason to put up with this anymore. I simply do not care what happens to these characters or kingdom.

Few types of enemy types that are not fun, just difficult. There are some parts that feel like they are purely down to luck as opposed to prep, placement etc. Some bits of the games feel awkwardly laid out, and either require prior knowledge of the game or save scumming. These are not problems i feel like i encountered in BG, POE, IWD, NWN etc. but you do here. 
If not for those problems this game comes pretty close to surpassing some of those previously mentioned because ultimately i really enjoyed this game. When i replay this game and i will there will be moments i dread, some of this game is not fun. But so much of it is absolutely excellent and although it won't overtake BG for being what i feel is a classic and the best in it's genre this is just as good in its own right. 
Recommended

Edit:
I did want to say one thing. It is obvious i immensely enjoyed the game. 180 hrs for one play through i think shows that. But, i don't find myself looking up the game too much post finish. I know when i finish a game by Bioware for instance, i spend hrs post finish either prepping for a new play through or looking up companion finishes or alternatives etc. 
My experience with Bioware are those little/side stories and how attached i get to that. Im just using Bioware as an example but lets take the Witcher series and pivot instead. The small details that infatuate you with the world or small instances. I truly care about each instance each person. Each left or right decision felt so monumental not just from gameplay or from story telling but because i cared about that companion or moment. There were very few moments i felt frustration because i felt i was being railroaded into something (like this game can feel like with it's alignment system). 
I've seen many arguments stating that romance in this is much better then a Bioware game (and im just choosing a specific example here again) because you had to put so much effort into doing things right and that it was a extended path and not just one click and your in (once again i would actually argue against this to a degree, i basically 100% this with eyes closed and felt very minor relative to the game). But my point being is i didn't care so much. I barely remember half the characters names and although doing their side quests may of been harder or longer and more involved i cared less. The game never made me care about these characters,  they have to be quirky have this set personality that they never feel like people you could care about they were very one page, one dimensional.",1644124568,1646376746,True,2,0,0.53941643238067627,0,True,False,False

It offers some nice tactical combat for the most part, character creation is fairly involved and the story seems really interesting but it has a number of problems that I just can't ignore.

The balancing once you get past the first couple of levels is pretty bad. Enemies are far too tough, many of them being far too hard to hit or having high resistances so that instead of being a fun interesting combat it's either a slog or a slaughterfest. 
For the campaign itself I couldn't play very much: you have way too much time pressure on you, its constant, to really enjoy and explore like you would want to in this type of game. It almost actively hurts you if you want to try and see everything, do all the side quests etc. because you are going to miss out on something or risk losing the main quest completely.
I haven't gotten up to it yet, but I am dreading if I ever do: the kingdom management is supposedly the worst part of this but I can't comment on it yet.

The combat defaults to 'Real Time With Pause' which is an odd choice seeing as turn-based combat is what pathfinder is based around. Some things are really finnicy with spells: if you try to dispel an area effect you are more likely to cancel a random buff on the closest ally which makes no sense at all.

If you come expecting the full range of options from pathfinder you may be a little dissapointed as they only have so much and simplified a number of things. However, I don't mind it too much.

Overall, the game has solid ideas behind it but they could have been executed and balanced better so you don't need to have a perfectly optimised group that plays perfectly in order to beat the game.
I haven't had a look at the sequel yet, but I fear that a number of these issues, i.e. time crunching and poor balancing are likely to reappear.
I hope that the devs are focusing on this feedback though, because they have the potential to (if they break from some of these decisions of over-difficulty and time pressure) make these decent games absolutely brilliant. 

TL;DR: It's got problems, but it can be fun if you can deal with a game that's on the hard side with lots of time pressure on your exploration. I'd get it on sale.",1646346281,1646346281,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What prevents from from recommending it is the numerous instances of INCREDIBLY bad balance.   You'll find yourself comfortably challenged most of the time, but too many areas sport sections that are wildly out of joint with the rest of the zone.  To avoid spoilers, let's talk about the ""zone"" that was the final straw and prompted this post.  I found myself confronted with some people, which I swept aside easily.  Moving on, I found numerous undead spread across a half-dozen or so rooms and ambushes, which also fell easily to my party.  Taking a right down a non-descript hallway I find myself in a room with two constructs.  Those constructs down my tanks almost immediately.  Pausing and queuing up my best healing spells and chugging my best potions buys me one round before they go down and the rest of the party is wiped.  

There was no warning that somehow this room was different from any of the others.  There was no ""abandon hope"" message before the door.  Just a quick death nestled amid an otherwise unremarkable cluster of encounters.  This was not a case of an unlucky early crit , it was creatures far and away nastier than everything else, and I wasted forty minutes of play time because of it.  I don't tend to hit F5 before every fight when the fights aren't much of a thing.  

This happens frequently enough to sap my enjoyment of the game.  I know balance is hard in a game with something like 20 character classes and a group size of six, but it isn't a case of a bad group, just a creature with a threat rating way higher than everything around it.  Boo.

Addition: All of the above is true.  However, I started the game back over in Easy difficulty. I'm getting way less sense of accomplishment, but it's still somewhat enjoyable.  The occasional fight that's way harder now is a pleasant occasional challenge rather than a total party wipe and restart.  The kingdom management is really enjoyable, too.

- Deep RPG, requires lot of planning, using tactics
- Lots of bugs and exploits have been removed (mostly)
- Awesome story and lore (little too similar to most RPGs, but still can enjoy)
- So much role-playing options with sub-classes
- Turn based and real-time mode switching is awesome to clear insignificant enemies
- Managing kingdom is entertaining (unless you run into the bugs)

The Bad
- The biggest flaw of them all (Dialog is not narrated - even in companion and main quests, which to be honest is quite annoying because you can't really rest your eyes even after a 30-40 min turn based dungeon which also requires reading stats and spell descriptions, etc.)
- Even if reading a book in game was your thing (Font size is small and no Font options for those who don't like the default)   
- Advanced mechanics are poorly explained (which isn't all bad, since it helps with challenge but some optional explanation for thing would have helped a lot)
- Need to do 5-6 hours of research to multiclass properly.
- Companions are very poorly designed for battle and do not fit the mechanics of the game and there is no way to change that without modding, so if playing challenging mode you need to hire companions with no story. 
- Item progression can be bad as well for some classes. where you will find overpowered weapons in first part of the game and never need to replace them with weaker stuff you get later on.

The reason I absolutely despise it, after dumping 170 hours in it, is it's blatant disrespect for my time. Each and every mechanic of the game is build to waste your time, not with repetitive gameplay, minigames or other time consuming mechanics, but with constant loading screens, slow walk speed, a ridiculous resting system where you have to listen to unskippable nonsensical chatter from your party members, or being forced to traverse multiple huge maps after battle just to reach the exit... Want to exit the throne room, fist walk to the other end of it in slow motion, pass 3 dialogs and 3 loading screens to exit the castle. 

Then there is the  journal, which is worthless since you have no idea what the current mission wants you to do or even where it wants you to go. 

The kingdom management is a joyless, pointless and nerv wracking torture device that I hated from the very first moment and deactivated it right away. It sucks, it's stupid, it's worthless.

What about the companions you might be inclined to ask: Well, all of your companions are stereotypical, blunt, uninspired idiots, most of whom I wanted to kill right from the first encounter. Jubilost died by my hand after his first line of dialog and I never regretted my decision (Fuck this self-absorbed guy). I killed Jethal on her first companion mission, because I rather side with a random dude on the road than with such an paper cutout of an evil character (rott in hell)... Really, who wrote this backstories, toddlers? But it doesn't end there, all backstories are abysmal, Harrim the dwarf who hates dwarfs because he failed to craft a helmet??? Really? Valerie, aaah don't get me started with this crap... Tristan, oh how much I hate this guy, this bigoted little fuck... 

Then there is combat, and maybe someone can explain to me where the fun is in missing 9 of 10 hits??? Did the devs of owlcat tried to become even more annoying then XCom RNG? As an example, the fight at Olavs outpost, between Valerie and this other dude I couldn't care less about, I switched to super easy difficulty and with auto combat on, it took about 20 minutes to finish because 95% of all hits missed. Who is supposed to have fun here?

Finally the whole story is just bad. Nyrissa is the worst arch-enemy ever created in a game. There is nothing interesting about her, nothing that engages you to fight her except for not loosing the game. It's all just a waste of time.

Customization from a mechanical standpoint is neat: Character options are numerous and the vast majority of them are useful. Many PF martial feats have made it into the game, which is nice for the Ranger, Barbarian, Fighter and Rogue classes at higher levels, since there exists this feeling that they don't fall behind the casters too much, especially if the casters are able to buff them; in my run, Amiri and Jaethal (not to mention Ekundayo, who is overpowered no matter what you do with the guy except you are trolling) are a quite good frontline and they are able to dish out a large portion of the party's damage output, thanks to the Feats options, Jaethal's own spellcasting, Linzi's buffs and the Sorcerer/Wizard spells buffs. Spellcasting, Metamagic and the Magus mechanics are very good, with the exception of many spells -and here comes the first negative aspect that comes to mind-, which are either absolutely useless or simply fall way too short compared to spells of the same level; particularly, it's surprising how useless Deep Slumber is, due to the high rate of +3 to +6 CR encounters (even in numbers), which render even the Empowered version of the spell a costly and mediocre version of Hideous Laughter: you'll VERY VERY rarely find two or three humanoids, animals or magical beasts who any two of them won't sum up more than 11 HD -or even more than 16-, or that would be worth a level three spell at all at that point of the campaign (meaningless real-time combat encounters). One other thing of note regarding spells, is that spontaneous spellcasters don't get the option (or I haven't found it) to trade off spells at even levels -saving 2nd-, and therefore if you get early spells like Sleep and the aforementioned Deep Slumber, unless you reroll your character, which is tedious (and costly, at 10k gp after the first three rolls), you are stuck with unusable known spells for the rest of that character's career. 
A second negative aspect is that there are a few bugs here and there that make it a little frustrating. One of them is that, many times, resurrected characters are able to move but they are buggy and unable to perform any actions, and they won't leave this state in any way except by saving and reloading the game, solution you have to discover, but even after doing so, it's tedious.
A third negative aspect is that the autosaving options are horrible. Practically, there are no options. The game will pretty much arbitrarily and with little sense save upon arriving certain locations or upon the triggering of certain events, but if you are navigating a Dungeon through deadly encounters one after another, don't expect the thing to save for you; hell, one should probably bind the quicksave function into one of the extra mouse buttons, or the spacebar. 
And lastly, not exactly a negative aspect, but something I'd think about a little better next time I design a game: it would be great if the character (or one of the characters) who plays the romantic arc or romantic side of the story for the protagonist wasn't crippled by an absurd 8 base Constitution score, all while being of a race that doesn't even get a -2 to Constitution; it doesn't even make sense with her slavery background... how the hell did she survive through the flu, famine or even a cold winter? Did their masters also waste a lot of resources on scrolls? Come on guys... the poor girl dies once a Dungeon. We should get an extra income for playing her, just to pay for the diamonds/raise dead scrolls.

Ultimately, I am going to say that I recommend the game, but in reality I think there are many downsides that made me just rush through the last three chapters as I just wanted it to end, it became a torture.

The game started really well and it caught my attention fast, it reminded me a lot of happy days and Baldur’s Gate 2. However, it was much less dynamic, the story was slow, and it lacked heavily on side quests.
The kingdom management gameplay was fun at the beginning, then it just became obnoxious.
The map is very crowded with areas to explore, yet they are all the same, they do not offer enough diversity to make them interesting.

The best part of this game is its story. I liked it a lot, the world has a ton of lore to piece together and there’s more than enough stories to read. However, the game does not play well as the main events that drive the story forward were timed quite badly and at times it happened that you had to skip months of time in order to reach the new chapter as the events are timed and the in-game time is really important. In the beginning I explored everything leaving no stone unturned, and still I had to skip a sack of days in order to reach the next event.

Somewhere along the way the game simply lost me, it became a pain and I just wanted to finish it as I wanted to see the entire story unfold. In my opinion 180+ hours that I spent on this was way too much. The game should have been half that amount to be interesting, or it should have offered better content in the side quests.

Another thing worth mentioning is that the game suffers from a fair share of bugs that might get on your nerves. Oh, and I don’t even want to get started on the difficulty, because anything you choose past Easy mode is going to be a lot more than challenging. You can tweak the difficulty in quite a lot of parameters though so you should play with that.

Bottom line, and this review is already too long, the game has its charm, but it lost me at one point and there was no going back after that. I am not going to play this ever again, I will definitely try the sequel at some point in time after some years have passed and I forget the negative stuff from Kingmaker.",1645654508,1645654508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pathfinder kingmaker is a great game.

I'm not a new RPG player, I enjoy games like Divinity Original Sin, I ate my teeth on classic that was Planescape Torment, I am a Pathfinder (tabletop) Game Master and I can see problems in this fun game.

It's still a very fun experience, though if not for my many-year experience with similar games, I feel I would fail more often than I should, especially how reload-happy some encounters can be in mid-late game, when enemies start to have AC of 40+, similar with saves, where character that is not optimized for specific role (damage/tanking/targeting saves) has no right to exist.

That being said, Pathfinder: Kingmaker may be the truest spiritual successor to fantastic games like Baldur's Gate 2 that I have had the pleasure of playing.

Pros:
Great music
Consistently above-average writing (the prologue is a little rough but it gets and stays better)
Mostly good voice acting
Good and interesting story
Solid CRPG mechanics and combat implementation
Kingdom management was mostly fun

Cons:
The devs tried to implement time limits as a way of adding urgency and weight to the progression of the story, which may make you feel hindered at times.  I generally hate timers, but I didn't think that, for the most part, this was an insurmountable hurdle, but I do think it did more harm than good.

Tooltips and quest entries are abysmally bad at telling you where you need to go, what you need to do, or what the ramifications of your decisions will be (both in the story and in character creation/development). Unless you're an ironman masochist, you'll probably end up looking a lot of things up.

Kingdom management difficulty ramps WAY up about 70% of the way through the game, and since a crumbling kingdom can lead to a game over, that's potentially a very frustrating end to your adventures.  If you haven't bolstered your advisors sufficiently by this point, it's very, very difficult to turn things around.  I was fortunate enough to have blundered into a salvageable situation, but I'm sure plenty of people have hit that brick wall and never come back to the game.  Recommend you do at least a little research on kingdom management to avoid this potential pitfall.

The last third of the game is, frankly, a slog.  There's a lot of drawing out of the action, the constant kingdom management assaults are tiresome, and the last 'main dungeon' is reminiscent of Zelda water temples, and filled with enemies with far too much health, who all like to spam disabling and stat-reducing spells, forcing you to continually use restoratives (and potentially rest repeatedly, while your kingdom crumbles on a timer).  That said, the final stretch of the story as you head toward its conclusion is very fun and interesting.

In conclusion:
Overall, if you like CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights (or Pillars of Eternity, for that matter), you will probably really like this game.  I very much enjoyed my time with it, though I wish I wouldn't have felt the need to go to the internet for guidance quite as often as I did.  There were too many potential pitfalls where a bad decision early on could lead to an undesirable (or potentially unwinnable) scenario way down the line, when reloading was either impractical or impossible.",1645297109,1645297109,True,15,0,0.685581207275390625,0,True,False,False

After tons of hours spent in this game and multiple restarts....I need to change my review.

Especially in Chapter 3 and 4. It's sad that they tried to put so much into the game and it leads to a LONG LOOOONG LOOOOONG imerssive breaking teleport hoping side quest to please all the B****ing people of your kingdom who cant tie their own shoe laces. Nothing felt meaningful after chapter 3 because you saved your people again and again and they still hate you. the kingdom management is annoying even on easy.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the debut of the Owlcat Games studio, which blew up a large cRPG bomb. Of course, the reworked tabletop template helped, but it can be seen on the game that it was made by enthusiasts.
In the game, you become the ruler of a small land, which has more problems than benefits. You are dealing with various catastrophes and events that are constantly falling on you , as if there was some focus in that. And of course it is, and in a wide story you gradually discover it with the help of your group of companions.
The gameplay is very similar to the old Baldurs Gate, but after a later patch, there was a choice between pausing real-time and turn-based combat, which can be changed anytime. The map of the world is extensive and there are places of interest on it that can hide a small, hand-painted location with a small event or a huge dungeon with lots of fights and puzzles.
In addition to the classic cRPG, the administration of the kingdom was added, where you build various buildings, in villages and towns, and solve problems with the help of your advisors. Management can be completely turned off and only the RPG part is devoted, and maybe this is a better option for someone, because it is very easy to fail and lose the whole game because of that. On the other hand, you will add about different parts of the vast lore of the world.
The authors were uncompromising in terms of complexity, although it is possible to find almost all the detailed information in the game's UI, but the turtorial is almost non-existent and it is very easy for a novice to get lost in a deep RPG system. In addition, the game is extremely uncompromising, mistakes are not forgiven, coincidence has a big impact and so save / load are very much used.
The game is huge, the possibilities of playing are many, if you do not have enough companions that the game offers, you can create your own mercenaries, but prebuild NPC companions have interesting mini-stories and interactions, as well as advantages if they act as advisors within the kingdom. You really play RPGs where your decisions shape the world and the story as well as your character, where each decision affects the character's alignment and gameplay.
The graphics is nice, the sounds are good, but sometimes they are disturbed by glitches, which do not affect the gameplay. The enemy's AI is simple.
For me, it is one of the best RPGs I have played in recent years and I can only recommend it to cRPG fans.

1) Story wise, this ranks as one of the better cRPGs I've ever played.
2) Mechanically, this is [b]BY FAR[/b] the best cRPG I've ever played.

How the developers were able to include an absolutely mind-boggling amount of tabletop mechanics and ability interactions seamlessly, blows my mind. This is the closest you will ever get to actually sitting at a table and playing an RPG with a group of folks, sans DM. You *must* have experience with either the Pathfinder or the DnD 3.0/3.5 system to understand half the stuff going on here. If you dive in on Normal difficulty with PoE style Pause-n-Play you will get annihilated, then blame the game. Turn-based mode is meat and potatoes way this system was meant to be played and there are so many nuances of the d20 system the game expects you to understand beforehand. 

This is not Divinity. This is not Pillars of Eternity, nor even BG2... this game is something else. There's so much going on, from Kingdom Management to Artisans to Companion plot lines -- it's like two or three games all layered as one big delicious piece of cake. And all of it is fleshed out; nothing feels half-arsed. I'm sure at release (and definitely before turn-based mode was introduced) this game had some darkened flaws, but as of today I'd consider it nearly perfect.

Quick Save. Enter room. Reload. Go back. Come back later. This is the main gameplay loop. It is utterly impossible to play this game without save scumming. Do yourself a favor and watch some gameplay footage before buying this.

Dice rolls, soooo many dice rolls. I get it, game depends heavily on dice rolls, but hot damn almost all spells and buffs feel very underwhelming. Bless, a spell that you can cast only twice before you need to rest, gives you a mere +1 buff on a 1d20 roll. Being slightly more lucky/unlucky can completely negate any tactic that you come up with.

In the beginning the game is very boring, especially if you play as a weapon (martial) focused character. You have no spells and you just watch you character roll 1d20 and hope for a roll greater than 12-15.

In one of the first caves that I crawled I got a debuff that reduced my DEX by 8 (which is a lot). In order to get rid of it, I had to rest 8 times, one rest per 1 DEX cured. Very tedious, considering that resting consumes resources and the main quest is also time controlled. Then I walked into a web trap and I shit you not I had to stare at my monitor as my character was rolling 1d20 hoping for an exact 20 roll (5% chance). Very fun.

This is the kind of game that lets you make mistakes, even ones that you didn't know were possible. Such as assuming the Economist position in your barony was a joke because the game did not give you someone to fill that position. (it did, but you can easily miss one and the other ends up dying really easily due to plot stuff, DLC characters not withstanding)

I've played PC RPGs my whole life and have not encounted anything like that before. 

Also given plot and story events are time sensitive with a bizzare difficulty curve you really have to powergame. Since its a single player game it makes you feel smart for doing so. On top of this the game rarely throws what feels like an impossible task at you now and again expecting you to complete it. This type of trolly design choice makes the world more immergent but can also be frustrating. 

But the time sensitive nature of things?

The game does not explicitly tell you that you have to put most kingdom management goals on the backburner until you are at least level 10 and about halfway+ through the main story. The game lets you play with the kingdom management unrestricted despite this however and you can easily cause a game over just because the plot baby soiled its diaper. 

Its great tension and immersive but only to people who are so jaded by video games you'd resort to playing something like this in the first place.

The presentation of the game is incredible with a painterly look and a perfectly fitting soundtrack. High resolution art assets abound, a visual feast.

You might see many complaints about the randomness and the unfair dice rolls. Truth is it's less the RNG that is at fault than it is the way the devs pimped almost every monsters or skill checks to create 'challenging' encounters, To a point where even what is considered trash mobs are basically at pair with a regular PC. 
You'll then find stuff like : lvl 1 Goblins hitting you with +9 attack bonus while having an AC of 18, mid level monsters with 45 strengh, groups of casters that bypass resists and use copious amount of unavoidable crowd control on you, or picking berries at lvl 1 where it's a DC of 20 and you take 1d6 points of damage when failing... in normal difficulty.
The game expects you to throw everything you've got constantly, and min max to a certain degree if you don't want to have a bad time. And even then you'll still have to save scum quite a few times to deal with some situations.

But everything else is charming. The story, the atmosphere, the lore, the feeling of adventure and the old school vibe to it.

First of all, I love the genre, played Pillars of Eternity 1&2, Divinity 2, Tyranny, and many others. While the basics and the RPG elements of the genre exists in P:K, the combat is so unbalanced that it is a chore to play through. Every time the characters or the progression or the content draws me in, the next combat pushes me away from the game.

I tried both real-time and turn-based combat. The main problem does not stem from the game's mechanics but from the sheer stupidity of the dice rolls. The tutorial fights are easy to a fault, as in it does not reflect the whole truth. As soon as the tutorial finishes, you start getting confused. ""How did all of my team get scared when I have been putting skills into fear saves?"" you ask, ""What was even the point of giving Linzi a fear-save skill if she is unable to cast it, BECAUSE SHE IS FEARED?"", you ask. Before you know, half of your team fucked off to the other side of the map, Linzi chasing slowly behind while getting absolutely wrecked by a nigh unbeatable flying skull.

""My team is making decisions and saving the world"" you think, ""we are on a path, as friends, to challenge the Stag Lord"", however, your path is cut off by two spider swarms that CANNOT be damaged save for throwables and torches BUT the throwables are dice-rolls too. So the alchemist's fire you gave to your party to kill a bunch of spiders have now run out since everyone is both blind and constantly atrophied and cannot hit the side of a barn with a rock; your party that aimed to establish a kingdom are now dead to a bunch of small spiders, something that you encounter maybe 2 hours into the game.

I don't know what their aim was in creating such a combat system; many games utilize the same mechanics but they optimize it for the game, such as Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate. For P:K, the combat system is just tedious, unenjoyable, and a slog to go through. I remember that my party was stuck in some webs, constantly trying to roll for saves to get out of the area but could not, since not every character built the required stats. I watched for around 10 minutes while my team tried desperately to use their legs to walk through some fucking webs, getting stuck again after taking one step. 

Overall, the presentation and the content seem okay, but I cannot go through with this combat system. There are so many better games that offer the same if not more content with an enjoyable fighting experience.

I am a casual gamer but like to think I have enough experience with ""dice games"" like DnD to understand the system. So, I went into this understanding the technicalities of saves, rolls, bonuses, etc, but I am definitely not super experienced in this genre. 

The story is interesting but I quickly got bored as there are so many distractions within the game. It's hard to focus and pay attention and enjoy the main story when there are constant ""fires"" you have to put out- quests failing because of time limits, kingdom events, etc. It's like you're always being distracted by the things you are supposed to enjoy. Failing quests or kingdom events because you 1) didn't do them in time or 2) just outright failed them will have negative effects later on and can be frustrating to think about. You will need to save very often and probably use multiple save files.

The combat was enjoyable very early on but quickly became frustrating due to difficulty. You can find references here or online joking about ""The DM hates you"" ""I would fire the DM"" etc. Some encounters are a joke even when the difficulty is turned way down. That wouldn't be an issue if these encounters weren't peppered through otherwise low level or casual areas, i.e., if you walk into the wrong part of the map you will die. So fun. Save often. 

The kingdom management system sounds like it would be fun but I didn't think so. There are ""issues"" which pop up in your kingdom, and then there are ""projects"" you can complete to bolster your kingdom. A big problem is, these can only be completed by certain advisors (party members,) and their chance of success varies. If you fail (or fail to address) too many issues your kingdom has unrest and eventually riots, and unless you change the settings, you can actually lose the game if your kingdom is not managed properly. When your kingdom is in a bad state like riots or unrest, you are penalized, making it harder to complete the issues and dig your way out. It sucks, plain and simple. I thought it was tedious and mostly irrelevant and ended up switching it to automatic and not allowing failure just to proceed through the story. 

I ended up turning the difficulties way down in order to just play through the story, but after a few weeks of not playing I have no desire to go back and will uninstall. There are so, so many areas in the game where there seem to be a dozen or more encounters with trash mobs before getting to your objective- If I was playing on normal difficulty, each and every one of these encounters would have to be planned out, items/buffs used, save scummed, etc just to proceed.

The writing is fairly inconsistent in quality, fluctuating in between passable and cringe-worthy.
The difficulty fluctuates as well, with near constant roadblocks of just downright unfair fights that seem almost tailor made to induce rage-quits. And this is on the bog standard normal difficulty.

The game saddles you with a party of 'original characters, do not steal' which to be fair, is pretty reminiscent of playing an ACTUAL table top RPG so I can't fault them for that. And if you don't like them, and don't mind giving up some story opportunities, you can always shell out a few cart loads of gold and hire some mercenaries, which you can customise to your hearts content. Unfortunately, the game pushes you to use the original characters in any advisor roles, and punishes you for assigning mercenaries.

The moment I realised I wasn't having fun, was when my party was ambushed on the road by 5 greater fire elementals. After struggling with the fight for a while and re-loading a few times, I finally managed to kill 2 of them, only for 2 more to spawn in from the side of the tiny map the game had placed me on.

Most quests are engaging, interesting, and wonderfully crafted. And the main plot of the story is captivating. Wonderful music, excellent combat system, and beautiful characterizations all around. So, a perfect game!

Nooooot quite. The last chapter of the story is PUNISHING and the one aspect where the game fells apart slightly. The overuse of the Wild Hunt enemies is annoying and frustrating, there are a lot of bugs present in the tactical combat -which you will need to use religiously to beat all of the serious encounters once Pitax is involved-, and some the game punishes way too harshly for a missclick or for not building your characters properly.

This wouldn't be a problem, except that there's no good way to grind without missing out on tons of other time-sensitive things. The game also has no escape feature, so if you end up against a too powerful enemy, your only option is to reload and hope you don't lose too much progress.
• Swarm Enemies can't be damaged by weapons. This is just stupid and unrealistic.
• It's not always clear what you should be doing. Combined with the time-sensitivity, this causes some stress that I'd rather avoid.

Don’t get me wrong, its not a terrible game. It is a fairly decent maybe even great game, being dragged down by design choices which are honestly baffling for such a new game. It sticks too close to the rules of the PnP, closer even than any GM I would want to play with. There are reasons why most people ignore a good chunk of the rules of a PnP system they play: because those rules are often not very fun. This game feels like applying with a bunch of rule-lawyers and a malicious GM, who thinks he players against the players, not with them.

I am no stranger to both video-game RPGs and PnP-RPGs. This game tries to combine these two worlds but takes the worst aspect of each and forces them into the other. There are almost [u] no improvements over the physical PnP game. [/u] Inventory management I guess… so you don’t have to keep track of encumbrance yourself… oh wait… that is a rule that mostly gets ignored.

Many PnP-mechanics just don’t make the transition to videogame. [u] Constant need for rests, chance-based skill-checks, and dice deciding combat. [/u] All that can be fun in the setting of a PnP-campaign where you goof around with your friends but are tiring or downright frustrating when sitting alone in front of a screen.

When compared to other cRPGs available on steam, I just don’t see any reason to play Pathfinder Kingmaker, aside from the story, or a blind devotion to the PnP system. Comparing it to “Divinity Original Sin 2”. DOS2 has: excellent multiplayer, more strategic combat, voice-acting for everything, hard-skill checks instead of random ones, and just a ton of small of quality-of-live changes which improve the experience tremendously.

PFKM is not terrible top to bottom. There is a good game hidden somewhere. But no matter how good a steak is, when to take a dump on it I will not eat it, no matter how good a steak it is…",1644074104,1644074603,False,2,0,0.478087633848190308,0,True,False,False

When i first stumbled into the world of Golaria , i was confused and lost but don't get discouraged just keep on playing and eventually the entire system becomes much simpler than you actually thought. although the game design seems to favor to suddenly have a high difficulty ceiling it always feel amazing to ignore that location and coming back to it stronger to NaeNae right on the enemies that frustrated you in earlier encounters, when you build yourself to counter those enemies after a level or two.

Decisions you make along the way, however minor and insignificant will eventually be braught up or hinted at later in the game. that just makes me sigh in relief.. or cry when i see the consequences of my careless actions, yet when all your decisions pile up in the end and are shown to you.. it just put a smile on your face.

The music in my opinion are really great, and my guess is how the boss themes are structured; IT start up with a rise of the current crisis , then moves to the boss's actual music for about a minute as you try and see whatever works, or read the description assuming you pass the DC, then it turns to the theme of ""you"" a triumphant theme that is always played at the end of every boss theme encounter, it is always the same to symbolize that you're the boss and you overcame this Crisis!

The kingdom management aspect of the game is fun, takes a while to get used to and the information can be overwhelming. But it serves to be a meaningful way to pass the time after you finished exploring the part of the map unlocked before starting the next main quest or until you've something to do. On that note do not be discouraged! my advice is to focus on problems first and gaining regions first, don't worry about aligning buildings for the little bonus, it's helpful early game but mid to late game it wont matter much.

 In summary the game is really fun , and i would say the best game i've ever played.

At $20, this game is an easy recommend, and if you're seeing this review during sale and on the fence, I highly encourage you to pick it up.

Scope
The scope of the game is immense. You start out as some no-name called upon to oust a nearby bandit lord with the promise that you’ll receive a barony in exchange. From there, the game really takes off as you have to defend your new barony from ever more dangerous threats while also managing its growth into a prosperous kingdom. To that end, the game has a deep combat system but also includes kingdom management and city-builder mechanics (if that’s turning you away because you don’t want to play a fantasy accountant, you can automate the city-builder and kingdom management stuff).
My first playthrough clocked in at around 100 hours and I didn’t even have all of the DLC or complete all of the side quests. If you’re trying to 100% the game and aren’t super familiar with things you can really get a lot of milage out of Kingmaker. Whats more, there are a LOT of story decisions that you make throughout the game that can impact you, meaning that there is a lot of replay value. Different alignments effect things as mundane as what characters you can recruit, to the soundtrack and appearance of your capital.

Combat/Gameplay
This is sort of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Owlcat took everything from the Pathfinder rulebook and imported it pretty successfully into a video game. This means that if you know the pathfinder rules well, then you can understand Kingmaker and how to have an effective character and party pretty easily. On the other hand, if you’re not familiar with table top games or Pathfinder then there is a pretty significant difficulty curve thrown at you. Some of the rules are pretty straight forward (like needing to make a reflex save on Grease to avoid falling), but unfortunately the transition from rulebook to video game wasn’t smooth everywhere. For instance, there is no kind of appendix that gives an explanation of what every effect does. You can learn a spell called Sickening Cloud which says that creatures in the cloud who fail a fortitude save become sickened, but there’s no in-game way to learn what the sickened condition means without casting the spell and then hovering over the character portraits to view the sickened condition.
The game uses both real time with pause and turn based combat—you can switch between either on the fly. This makes really easy encounters a breeze because you can just turn on real time and stroll through the encounter, but also lets you switch to turn based for maximum tactical efficiency for the harder fights.
The game ties a LOT of experience to certain persuasion checks. You don’t have to invest in persuasion if you don’t want to, but doing so means you leave a tremendous amount of experience on the table. At first this might not seem like much as most checks are a small amount of EXP, but over the course of a 100 hour playthrough I’m sure the EXP I earned through solely persuasion came out to at least a level and a half.
The game sort of runs out of steam in the final acts, which is a real shame. The whole last chapter consists almost entirely of room after room of encounters with enemies where if you fail a will save you become paralyzed for a whole round. There are buffs to improve your will save, but the enemy also has access to dispel magic to dispel your buffs. The end feels pretty grindy and honestly is probably the worst part of the game. The first few acts and slowly setting up your barony are the best parts of the game in my opinion, but as the game goes on things start to drag.

Visuals
Some of the textures here and there are missing some smaller details to really bring them to life, but the engine makes good use of weather effects, water effects and dynamic lighting to make the moment to moment gameplay feel crisp. Character models do look good though. Almost every piece of equipment shows up on your character (even potions on your belt).
At a handful of points in the game you’ll encounter a text-based event that is illustrated with these really nice looking storybook style pictures and the art there is really cool. This coupled with the overworld being a map with little pieces and figures moving around to represent your party traveling really creates a cool style that I haven’t seen before in crpgs.

Sound
The variety of sound effects and music are great. Hit effect sound really impactful, magic sounds explosive, and the music is great. The one caveat here is the combat music. There are a lot of environmental soundtracks but there’s really only a few combat soundtracks that are all a bit samey. This is made worse by the fact that a single playthrough could clock in at around 100 hours.

Bugs
I encountered significant FPS drops in several areas of the game (particularly those that had a lot of ambient environmental effects going on) and could not figure out why since I can run more intense games smoothly. Disabling V Sync fixed this instantly, but then the option kept re-enabling itself every so often. It wasnt a big deal to issue spot initially and fix but its weird that it happened in the first place and  weird that the option keeps turning itself on.
Some sound effects will constantly loop when multiple enemies die at the same time. For example, when I wipe out a pack of goblins with a couple of fireballs there will be a looping loot sound effect that doesn't go away.

There are still plenty of bugs, one of my favorites was a troll falling into a pit and then proceeding to walk under the ground and hit my people and I couldn't hit him. 

If you are not experienced with the Pathfinder 1st edition system then you will have a rough time as there is no explanation of mechanics in the game and this game is punishing if you do not utilize the mechanics fully. The game was built around RTwP but I find turn based to be better, how do you expect to use mechanics like 5-ft step on RTwP?

The Kingdom management part of the game is in my opinion fun, however poorly implemented (why cant I rotate buildings, wtf???). The biggest issue but not the only one I had was how you couldn't really spend time exploring (you can do some, but is somewhat stressful trying to balance it and thus not fun) if you wanted to do kingdom management and vice versa (and failing kingdom management means game over no chances). I managed to alleviate that issue but using the mod Kingdom Resolution, WARNING: This mod is outdated and some options WILL BREAK YOUR GAME; however Ruler Managed Project Time Factor works and does not break your game, this setting will adjust how much time you spend upgrading your advisor ranks (2 weeks is too long), I recommend 28% (4 days), 42% (6 days), or 57% ( 8 days) depending on how much time you want to free up, I did 4 days for the first test and found it to be plenty of free time and might try the 6 or 8 days next run through. I find making this adjustment means you are less pressured to get the Teleport Circles up as soon as possible (something you accidentally stumble into because most people don't focus arcane right away and its not explained), or the project to halve the time to rank up advisors (again, not something you find out till you stumble into it)

I highly recommend the mod Call of the Wild as well, includes more classes and adjusts some of the NPC party members so they are not useless (cough cough, Valerie).

At the beginning it seemed just n+1 in the genre, but later it dragged me in, needed few hours of playing.

So what Ireally liked:
+ The rich story, the variety of characters I can pick to play.
+ The good visuals considering the genre.
+ I really enjoyed how I can manage my own barony and later kingdom, this spiced up the things!
+ Also I really like that NPCs making comment on my actions but it is not necessarily excluding them from the game if i make something they don't like, in some hardcore CRPG it often happens.

And some downside, that I would improve, even with a patch for considering re-play:
- I'm not a hardcore gamer myself and I usually play these games for the story, not for the combat itself, the ""story mode"" is pretty nice, but it would be even nicer if some ""auto-follow"" toggle would be for other characters so I can really only focus on my main character who I impersonate!
- And also in connection to the above, sometimes a ""stronger hint"" would be charming where I have to go regarding a quest. :)
- Performance issue with with graphics/objects, regardless that I have a decent PC
- Some annoying glitch that can happen, so it is wise that you have a savegame for each chapter or ""big pile of quests done"" separetly.

So what so wrong ?

From an outsider standpoint :

I am what we could call a veteran in Pathfinder TTRPG and what shocked me:

-The game dont help you at all to learn, if you are not someone who played on the tabletop a few time with Pathfinder, you will NEVER know some of the rule, what is essential and what is optional.. you are on your own to learn rules of a TTRPG wich... without knowing the website D20PFSRD would be hard to access with ease (it is way faster than looking up in the book).

The kingdom management:

It Is pure trash and counter-intuitive so let me explain :

-In the TTRPG you have to build heaps of buildings and widen districts to get your city running and have to choose wisely what to do with the events, here you must NOT build any building some critical one like aviary, bulltinboard, courthouse and mage tower  because the cost vs the stats it give are just noth worth it so you must rely on events without thinking by throwing your best advisor to get your stats (as said earlier, a building gives you like 1 in one stats and 1 in another; an event give you between 3 to 5 in one stats and 1 to 3 in two to four differents stats and you get loads of events ! Only in late game, around chapter 4 that building begin to get somewhat useful) 

The kingdom rank-up system which could have worked but is very.. meh and lock you up for 14 days which in the meantime for no reason make you UNABLE to just assign or react to EVERYTHING wich could happens in the kingdom (even if it is a swarm of magical monster that you couldn't have guessed was coming !) and slap you with bad outcome ""'because you were doing something else and didn't act fast enough""'

Last thing about the kingdom management : DO NOT pursue thoses 'research the curse' until like.. chapter 3-4 because else you will lock down your advisor(the divine one) which you need to make grow your kingdom and most importantly get access to the critical TELEPORTATION CIRCLE buidling that you will crave to put in every town you have, tips thoses research are useful only to get one thing : the true end.. they.. dont help you meanwhile in the game, they LOCK for MONTHS your advisor.


-The Difficulty:

The difficulty is 2/3 of the time, the game is right in term of encounter, the other third just loaded with bull**** monster that ask you to CHEESE and go hardcore metabuild to not get half your team dead; why ? because they get 'handwavium' permanent HASTE, BLUR, DISPLACEMENT, true seeing and other extremely powerfull buff or even can spam at time spells that are two level higer than what your wizard can dream to hope at his level (and thoses are not boss, they are everywhere on some regions and attack by group of at least 4 to 5).

From all the monster template in the TTRPG, there is none like these in any books (because Paizo knew it wouldn't be balanced or fun), Owlcat just invented template that 'seem powerful' without even playtesting it and you will suffer if you dont literally break the ennemies with spells to either make them all unable to act or instantly kill them (and i was not underleveled or under equiped)

I am not even talking about in some moments where the ennemies just spawn all around you when you step in(they are not invisible, see invisibility do not work at these times) and you better have the right buff already running because you will get spanked really hard otherwise even if you play on 'normal'.

-Gameplay :

The game still feel very pathfinder but they have made some.. discutable choices like the available classes.. why the kineticist in the game while you opted out more 'normal' classes like the oracle, the witch or the summoner ? (or even the hybrid classes).

Also, they invented magic items wich a DM should do but.. oh the insanity, some mid to late game magical items are just.. insane, but in a power creeping way, a +4 fullplate that gives +8 in STRENGHT AND +20 movement speed ?! even a celestia plate (which by the way is quite legendary in his own right) is not THAT good.

-The story :

It is sad because on the other side they did some changes in the story to keep it fresh and even if they didn't invent the story (it is in large part same as the book) they did a lot of GOOD adjustment and put their own little thing to have a bit more plot, which is right ! 

But you get on the other end some very weird Axiomatic(moral) choice that are not very thought out and sometime you expect some but no.. i still get butt-hurt that you just cant tell to someone to shut it's trap and do what you say even tho you ARE it's king and he is going to do a mistake.. no you just HAVE to be Lawful..


--------
TLDR:
--------

Conclusion :

The game feel like you are stuck on a kingmaker campain with a very creative and very willing but bad, quirky, sometime bipolar and unreasonable DM.

All in all, a uneven game wich IS fun as a videogame but most of all : a not very good and flawed Pathfinder game (which it is our right to complain because in their kickstarter they DID advertise the game as THE pathfinder videogame.

They mostly have chosen the WORST campain, Kingmaker, which is known even in the TTRPG to NEED revamp on the kingdom management side (there is even peoples that wrote bunch of rules for the kingdom management to make it way better), they should have started with Rise of the Runelord which is THE campain to make the dungeon master AND the players discover the game.

Advice if you want a closer TTRPG experience choose at least those settings :
Play in turn based combat
Set difficulty as 'Custom' with at least thoses settings (the other settings are at your leisure)
-Turn Crit on 'normal' (crit should be crit for everyone)
-Turn off remove negative effects on rest (you shouldn't be able to heal permanent blindness or permanent negative level by sleeping it off, else some spells you have have just dont make sense anymore)
-Damage party to 1 (a fireball should hurt you as much as the bandit and dissuade you from blasting yourself without appropriate protection)
-Ennemy stats adjustment to 'normal' (this setting modify monster stats by applying 'hanwavium' stats all across their stats sheets and not directly their ability stats (that mean, a monster with 20 in strength should have a bonus de +5 from it but with this, it will still have a 20 strength but a bonus of +7 wich, mechanically and how the PFSRD system work is not something possible without cheating, because it is breaking the rules of how the base systeme is built upon)
-Put Ennemy difficulty to 'WEAK' (a few people on reddit and even myself after looking side to side with TTRPG sheet has realised that most monster in the game have inherently bloated stats, which IS the right way to make monster stronger, but by doing that, you push yourself to choose only 'the best' way to play each classes wich.. limit the fun if you want to play something a bit more unusual than magus, sorcerer, bard, barbarian and cleric.

A in bonus, a way to rectify and enhance the game are a few mods, they are all now compatible with the last update:
-Call of the wild (a must have, it add a lot of classes,Archetypes, feats, and abilities that were missing from the TTRPG)
-Touch of Magic (Arcane archer prestige class)
-Proper flanking 2 (fix the non-sensical flanking system)
-Derring-do (swashbucker base class)
-Favored class (add the favored class core rule that was missing for no reason)",1642669677,1643514648,False,3,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

pros :
- Music, graphics, lore, everything you want from a good old school RPG is top notch in this one.
- The exploration is wonderful, I had a blast taking a lot of time to find all zones
- Throughout the game, even more at the end, you really feel like your choices matter a lot. It seems like there are a lot of ways to play the game, and i liked it a lot
- Battle gameplay is profound and rich. You can either play it by turn combat (like Divinity), and pause combat (like Baldur's Gate). There are a LOT of options, skills, spells, even more than in Pillars of Eternity. I remember being amazed (and frightened) seeing the lvl 0 spells. I was like 'Ok i can litteraly spend 3 hours on each fight and still not optimize it'
- Kingdom gestion is very nicely done, and even if in the end it can be tedious, I had a very nice time doing it. You can even turn the option off and focus on the adventure if you don't like it !

cons :
- a LOT of loading times, and in the endgame they can be very long. I swear when i was handling my kingdom in the end, I had Twitch on to help pass times during the loadings...
- I was very frustrated to discover a 'time gate'. If you fooled around in the beginning of the game, you will not be able to finish everything in your kingdom. I had nearly everything to max rank but had to leave because because of the end game calling. Loading the screen of the last zone and automatically failing all quests i had left was a heartbreaker :(
- Battle music can be repetitive
- In the end game the foes  are almost always the same very annoying 2 types of monsters and that can become very tedious

8.5/10, would be a 9.5 if I wasn't so frustrated at the time gate discover. If you want to do everything, do it quick and don't fool around !",1643210032,1643210032,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

i still kinda praise everything else ;D
the story is fun, engaging and pretty interesting, some plot twists can really hit u hard. i like side quests pretty much, or should i say - companion's quests. cuz most of the side-quests r ur typical ""go there, kill this, find this, bring it to me"", but for the most part there's an actual interesting story behind it, so whatever, i wasnt bored.
the combat is... im in love with it.
it might be pretty hard to learn for someone who's not familiar with dnd or even with isometrtic games like that, i strongly recommend to play in turn based mode (this game is dnd based, dnd is basically turn based so i believe that's how it should be played. my first playthrough was on RTwP mode tho, but it's way more challenging, u can loose alot of actions and the micromanagement is way harder than in turn based).
what else? the world is big and pretty fun to explore, i really enjoyed finding all these small locations, most of em have some short cool story goin on.
alignement system is old as world, but it still offers u a way to role-play, at least the evil path is not a luckluster like in most games, and following a certain path will lock or unlock some big choices for ya, which is arguably cool. i liked it, but i've heard ppl complaining, cuz it locks u out some things for good, but hey, it also unlocks some other things, so that's a replayability win.
the companions r all great and i absolutely love them all. they all got cool character arcs and u can really affect them by ur choices.
overall i love this game, and if ure a fan of rpg games - that's a mustplay.
HOWEVER. there r some... issues.
as i've said in the beginning - B A L A N C E.
my first playthrough i did on hard, and it was fairly challenging most of the time, but near to impossible in every main plot battle, the balance was pretty weird.
my second playthrough i customised everything to be normal, as intended, without any modifiers. and it was... kinda super easy all the time but then u suddenly get a TPK from outta nowhere???
the last two chapters r COMPLETE BULLSH*T. i know the game mechanics pretty well so i build my team to be safe and strong, but (huge spoilers to the endgame) [spoiler] devs r u sadistic or smthn? these wild hunt arseholes r straight up OP bullshit. i could counter most of their spells and this fookin paralysis aura okay, but their AC?? REALLY?? my chars can hit pretty much everything except for these guys?? i absolutely hate them and i think they're really, really unbalanced. oh and also - who was the genious behing the castle location? im sorry but it's disgusting and i ask u to never do it again. this is not in the spirit of old school rpg's, if u were going for that. in old school rpg's there usually at least some kind of logic, or some hints along the way, but in this fookin castle there's nothing but random, painful death, and then some more random. i hate it. [/spoiler]
but overall this game is 8/10, worth all the money and time spent.

\\\The Good: 
The story itself is interesting, the characters are detailed, campside chatter is entertaining, and the game has a massive quantity of content to explore. Graphics and combat also feel good.

\\\The neutral: 
Slow and repetitive overland travel, exhaustion/need for constant rests, having to repeatedly revisit areas, and everything being on timers (that fail the game if not closely managed).

\\\The bad:

Lack of clarity, and 'gotcha' moments, where a seemingly innocent dialog option chosen, hidden skill-check not passed, or side-location not cleared 20 hours ago then locks you in for 'bad' events and outcomes way later, where you can't do anything about it. This also occurs with sudden events requiring/costing BP(kingdom funds) are dropped on you without warning, meaning that if you dont have significant surplus on hand, you simply have to reload an older save or miss out on boons/suffer penalties without even the option to take 20 seconds to sell/buy to be able to cough up the cost.

General grimdark themes where even your best efforts to do good always result in some degree of bad things happening/your choices backfiring, usually far after you're no longer able to go back and chance your choice. Additionally, 'hidden' (and sometimes 'best') outcomes that require super-specific chains dialog choices and actions over dozens of hours before things become clear, to the point where they would be essentially impossible on a first playthrough without following walkthroughs or wikis. 

Balance and 'pathfinder-isms' such as endlessly scaling DC's for everything, meaning that a character not specialised for something like diplomacy, perception, lockpicking, lore, soon ends up without the slightest chance to succeed on such a check. this goes for saving throws, with DC's above 40 showing up from monsters well before the end of the game, often from 'no-fun' powers such as fear effects. This is partly a ruleset thing, so fans of pathfinder might be used to it, but it seems to heavily push metagame knowledge or character optimization.

Alignment-locked conversation options.

Extremely time consuming (where quest timers can force-end the game), clunky, and somewhat RNG-vulnerable kingdom management system that feels intrusive and drags attention away from the enjoyable parts of the game, as well as requiring you to 'lock in' your main character for many (100+) 2-week periods to do rank-ups, not allowing you to address anything that comes up during that period (or do anything at all, for that matter).",1643017415,1643085083,False,27,0,0.721537172794342041,0,True,False,False

Nothing amazing, but solid average. The character progression system has significant depth if that is your thing (though it is closely taken from a P&P RPG system, so that's to be expected).

But now for the negative... Someone must have been in charge of the combat system, I'm sure. It just doesn't show. Calling it poorly balanced would be an insult to other games that are poorly balanced. Before I go on, note that I played in normal difficulty with turn based combat. I would consider myself an RPG veteran, but after the first playthrough was incredibly tedious, I started another with the use of extensive online guides. It was still tedious. Note my playtime. I wanted to like this. But I can't. 

Now, I understand that dice rolls are random (and the game doesn't cheat much), but RNG doesn't make the difference between an easy fight and hard fight, it makes the difference between creaming a boss before it has a chance to act and getting half your party disabled before you can act. It's insanity. You enter a room and instantly get hit by 3-4 gaze attacks that can paralyze a character for the entire fight. So you need to buff. But buffs are limited, so you need to quicksave before every. Single. Room. What fun! And you can still get unlucky. Roll poorly on 1-2 saves and you might as well reload. Or you enter a room and instantly get hit by half a dozen debuffs that require a somewhat rare item to remove. Well, reload until you get enough lucky rolls.

Speaking of loading. This is a minor point since it only matters in one large dungeon, but that dungeon requires you to activate/deactivate a magic item to progress. And while the game makes sure to save every single dialogue choice you made throughout the entire game (resulting in ~50mb per savegame - clean that folder up regularly, mine ended up taking up 5GB), it doesn't load the state of that item properly. So after the quicksave, make sure to toggle it or you will soon regret it. Remember how you quickload a lot? Yeah, more fun. Well, I say quickload. It does take ~20s each time. 

And then there are the debuffs. They're fine for the most part, but they don't end when combat is over. Makes sense for conditions that are supposed to be permanent. Sure, you need the right item or spell to remove them. But others just need to run their course. You will occasionally end up waiting a minute or two after a fight to have the confusion or paralysis run out on a party member. Try it. Sit in a video game and stare at your party for 60 seconds while a timer runs out. Tell me that's not fun!

And then it got even worse. I fight a boss, buffed to the gills, and just before I kill it, it gets off an AoE ice prison spell. Two characters paralyzed, everyone else takes damage every turn. The boss still died, but the spell remained. Now, you can make a check every 6s to get out of the prison. Just roll a D20, add your strength, and if that is a high enough number, you get out. Cool. Oh, wait, the DC is 35? And even a high strength character has maybe 12 strength bonus? So, my odds of breaking the debuff are 0%. So what, just wait it out, right? Well, the debuff lasts 20 minutes. Of real time.

Someone in the design process of this game thought that hard fights are fun, and hard fights take a long time, and thus if a fight takes a long time, it must be fun. Put 50+ zombies in a single room? Fun. Spawn five waves of basic enemies, each time claiming ""combat finished"" in between? Fun. Fight your way down a hallway, loot it, have another 3-4 groups spawn on your way back? Fun. 

All of these issues also exist in real P&P games, of course. And in every single one of those cases, the GM would instantly overwrite the rules. Or, after seeing their players get bored out of their minds, decide not to spawn the fifth wave of enemies. But this is a video game. It has no GM. So I can't recommend it.

It was fine, I struggled through; proud of my 99 hours in the game and my progress to only have the game throw all my builds down the toilet by killing off half my companions for story reason and forcing me to team up with companions I never used and didn't equip right or level up properly. I was nearing the end of the game and no matter what I tried I couldn't beat a particular boss. 

This is probably not an issue for some but for me removing core party members and replacing them with inferior/unused ones is very weak. I had no trouble with the few solo or two party quest but this one (I wont spoil) just ruined it for me.

What I will say is it feels like a cheap mechanic, killing off my favorite companion not because I failed and they died but to move the ""story"" along. Actually not sure if same companions every playthrough or random but it was several of my core companions plus my favorite all dead through no decision I made in the game and that feels wrong.

Game is really enjoyable, plot is fun but pacing is sometimes off.
Game is hard if you have never played Pathfinder tabletop RPG.
I recommend playing it.
Longer version:
I have finished the game on normal difficulty, so anything I say is from the point of view of someone that didn't do 100% of the game. The game was hard for me on the first playthrough, so if anyone reading it is going to play the game, I'll leave some tips at the end of the review. I will also not give out any spoilers even if I'll talk about the ending (how it was presented, not what was presented).
[h1]Game System[/h1]
Game is based on Pathfinder 1e from what I know. So if you played it then you should feel at home. If not... well then that's a problem. The game doesn't explain the system well. I learned what DR is really late in the game. Oh and also game informs you what effects are on your character (like confused) but it doesn't say how to cure it, so I had to look it up a lot, especially in the later stages of the game. Also for some reason apperently Blind Fight prevents some attack/effect but it doesn't say that it does (or I didn't notice it or smth). 
[h1]Game coding[/h1]
The game is a buggy mess. Your characters can clip into terrain, in turn based combat game sometimes laggs for 10 seconds and it's easier to leave turn based combat and reenter it than wait. The game is big and it's obvious that the game will ahve some bugs, it has a lot of them BUT none of them are game breaking and through the whole playthrough I didn't have a single bug that was not repairable.
[h1]Story[/h1]
Plot is enjoyable. Sometimes the pacing is weird. Like you do a mission and out of nowhere they give you a title of sort and some bonuses. Like nobody said ""Ok if you're gonna do it, you'll get this"" and then you do it, and everybody calls you using the ""title"" just like that?. Sometimes when you expect some talk with the leaders of the faction, they don't talk with you, or the talk is extemely short.
The ending was presented in a typical way for a game that has ""choices"". If you ever played Fallout New Vegas it's more or less the same. You get some screens and then Linzi reads some text that depends on your choices. It's not nothing amazing. It kinda made the end worse for me, even if I really enjoyed the last fight.
Oh and some quests are marked on the map and some are not which is extremely annoying. Don't feel bad for looking up the guide to some quests.
And one more thing about story, some DLCs have a ""perfect"" time to start them. But you don't start them all from the normal game, some require you to start a new game and select given scenario, and THEN you load your main game save. Once you finish the DLC, you can import your progress to the main game. That's how Varnhold's Lot works. BUT f.e. DLC with tiefling siblings is playable from the main game. [b]Make sure to READ IT ON WIKI, when and how to start each dlc for the maximum content![/b] I didn't know that and I didn't play Varnhold's Lot at all.
[h1]Barony Management[/h1]
It's fun. Tedious but fun. Leveling your barony forces you to take 14 days per level (and you can do it 100 times, 10 times for 10 attributes). When you level up you can then send someone to do mission that gives you +1AC when you're in your territory and such. So it's worth investing your time into that. BUT the problem is that the game is time locked. You have limited time of days to finish the game, and I do not like that that much. I would rather not feel pressured. Yes sometimes you have like 300 days per chapter but well... after 300 days you HAVE to go into new chapter.
[h1]Companions[/h1]
Compation quests can end badly and that's amazing. I love that your actions have consequences, but I hate that game doesn't give you second chance in situations when it could. I cannot say more without avoiding spoilers so click on spoiler tag if you do not care [spoiler]You literally can kill a companion A after companion B says ""They are literally evil, please stop them"", and then the compaion A gets resurrected??? without a reason like 30 hours later and kills companion B???? and the only way to stop it is to have a good alignment???? or romance companion B, this is so fucking stupid[/spoiler]
Companions are also fun to interact with.
[h1]Tips[/h1]
1. Invest into ""Use Magical Device"". This skill allows you to cast spells from wands and scrolls. It is EXTREMELY helpful in the game. Anything you need is usually on the scroll.
2. When you fight ogres/cyclops/whatever that was calles [strike]can't remember what it was[/strike] make sure to bring a LOT of acid damage. It ma be from Jubilost companion that has acid attack, or from Acid Splash spell (or similar). Again: it can be scrool spell, but you need to invest into  ""Use Magical Device"" to use it reliably.
3. When you hit chapter 6 and 7 (there's a quest ""Ancient Curse, Part X"", the ""X"" is the chapter you are in), make sure to get some ""Freedom of Movement"" spell on scrools (or cleric or smth) OR invest into ""Blind Fight"" feat on your characters. Some enemies in these chapters and the following chapters have basically attack that renders your characters USELESS. And sometimes the game throws like 10 of these enemies. Each of theme do this attack once per turn, and any failed save will make your character useless for the fight. I personally picked ""Bling Fight"" on EVERY character that apperently makes you immune for that attack.
4. Prepare (or buy scrolls of) ""Protection from Alignment, Communal"" and ""Protection from Energy, Communal"". You'll thank me later when you make a certain end game optional miniboss basically free EXP by casting protection from acid on your whole party.
5. Bless is very good spell that clerics can cast. It's better than bane, but if you can cast both of them that's great.
6. If you are stuck at something, I can vouch that Kineticist is really good after some level, you can respect at the tavern in your capital/trading post. I basically finished the game by brute forcing every pack of the enemies with Deadly Earth ability used on 3 kineticists. I just spammed it till things died lmao (it knocks people prone making the unable to use full action for attack, and also does damage).
7. Abuse turn based combat if you're stuck. Why? Because you can lmao. How? In turn based combat when you make a full attack that does multi-attack (f.e. 5 attacks) it does so at the moment and then moves to another person's turn . If you are in the real-time combat the character starts attack, and it does so for the next 6 seconds (f.e. it will attack 5 times in these 6 seconds), during these 6 seconds another character can start their attack. I believe you can put 1+1 together.",1642763886,1642763886,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The game shows potential but has some incredibly anti-fun mechanics. The characters get tired all the time, even just walking the map and you need to rest or you get a debuff , that debuff affects how much you can carry (which is already not much if you ask me) and only way to remove it is to rest.

Solid 9/10 with great replay value.

What I really like about Pathfinder: Kingmaker is thats is actually immersive, the choices feel organic and the game mechanics dont force you into a straight and narrow evil socipath killing all or goodie two shoes being nice to all paths. The cause and effect reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2 (Mild generic spoiler: good intentions don't always give good results...).

Game basically has two main modes:
Party RTS - Great on its own
Kingdoom manager - Decent on its own
Together they merge to give a really cool experience and fantasy of being an actual ruler.

Now if you decide to give this game a try a piece of advice.. PLAY ON LOW DIFFICULTY FIRST TIME AROUND. Seriously, no joke, the RPG system used for mechanics is rough for low level characters (Start of the game) and higher difficulty levels give flat stat bonuses (meaning they make the early game much harder than late game). In order to succeed on a high difficulty level you either need to spend hours theorycrafting and reading spoilers or know the game already (how to min max, what mobs you meet where and what consumables to bring what rewards you get and when, how to ""cheese"" the mechanics etc). Its nice depth for replay value but will easily turn off even an experienced RPG gamer on first playthrough, when it effectively will force you to save scam non stop to progress. So just do yourself a favor and play on the lowest difficulty first time, and enjoy the stellar game.

Also while I sang praises about immersion and choices, in a few cases they  will feel a bit arbitrary and forced, which is why its a 9 not a 10 in my book, not a perfect game but worth checking out.

Response to things I heard about before playing;

Bugs: Not that many that I ran into, was usually a mechanic I misread 

Errors: There are a few slip ups on the dialogue toward the end. Minor stuff. 

As a game: 

1. As a TTRPG adaptation; very good. If you have a craving for making DND 3.5/Pathfinder characters and playing with builds this is great. Very true to the mechanics *and* quest/campaign feel. 

2. As a game itself; fantastic, but flawed. Reminds me of Fallout in alot of the best ways; the hidden clocks, pretty consequential choices, a proper escalation in scale 

The thing I enjoyed most about this game was that as you hit high level, you face the kinds of threats a TTRPG villain would throw at you, beyond just tougher mobs. The story starts small and really escalates at a fun clip. 

The worst thing is also one of the best; there are *alot* of kingdom mechanics and until you understand them all it's easy to miss some and it's easy to miss doing some kingdom things. Personally I like learning by failure but I could see how this would be frustrating for some.

It's not for everyone.  I know this because only 36% of people have the achievement for completing chapter 2.

It does what it does very well, which is to try and emulate a pen and paper role playing game without getting terribly bogged down.

There's a time limit on the main story line, although I haven't found it very limiting.  You pretty much have to do all the quests and go in all the areas or else you're losing out on experience points.  You have time with a little extra.

The game can be hard.  Very hard.  If you aren't well-versed in the Pathfinder system, play on normal.  I know everyone says that about new games, and that you're special.  I thought I was special. I've played all sorts of DnD video games and once or twice with pen and paper.  I gave up after 20 hours of dying and put it on normal.  Now, after 60 hours, I could probably up the difficulty.

You get to run an actual kingdom.  That can be good or bad.  Being a king (I think you're a baron?) is rather time consuming.  Everyone comes to you with problems.  They are often time sensitive, and you can't solve everything.  If you are someone who has to perfectly complete everything in a game, this might be frustrating.  You can turn it off (have it run automatically) if you want.  Not every choice matters, but many do, and you might find out about the importance of that choice 10 hours later.  You might never find out and just miss out on something nice.

The positives: The system is ported fairly well from TT into a videogame format and the pre-generated characters are well voiced and have interesting builds/backstories. The combat, when put into turn based, is challenging and thoughtful (more in line with actual Pathfinder and Divinity Original Sin). The story, from the parts I could get when not bogged down by the issues I had with the game, was truly fun to work through. 

My problem with this game, and what ultimately made me quit and uninstall after 2 solid tries, falls into a couple different categories. In my opinion Pathfinder Kingmaker has this unnecessary almost MMORPG grind (especially with the Kingdom Management minigame), abrupt and absurd spikes in difficulty, and I suspect a slightly skewed RNG. 

When you buff the bejesus out of your party and still wiff on most if not all your attacks, you know something is wrong. Kudos to whomever programmed that; I doubt even Will Wheaton ever rolled that many 'Nat 1s' in a single combat encounter.  When some main dungeons have multiple in-game days worth of fights where you must be fully buffed, you know this was a game built for a grind, an artificial game time extender. 

Finally, placing restrictions on certain things allowed in the TTRPG is frankly silly (I'm looking at you: resting restriction when in a dungeon.) Sure, make it *much* more likely to get attacked but that's the point on resting - I get that. However, when the game still docks the time spent ""resting"" but doesn't let you recover spells and abilities, making you have to leave and then come back? That's absurd.

It's a shame, really. I like the system, the world, the characters and lore. However I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.",1642371793,1642372218,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played 81 hours but after the first 10 or so the experience barely ever changes, besides that at some point you get so strong that you just leave all the battles in real time and your guys just run in there and kill everything and you rarely have to do anything at all. ""Well, turn up the difficulty!"" you say. The problem as the game progresses is that there is just *so much stuff* and *so many enemies* and if you get difficulty to a place where every battle has to be fought in turn based combat, the game completely falls apart. Same enemies, over and over, in some chapters hundreds trolls or bandits or barbarians need to be killed.

I enjoyed this game for leveling up and gearing characters. The character building system is complex and rewarding lets you make a ton of choices. But at some point I realized I was playing it just to get to the next level up or find the next treasure chest. Eventually that gets boring.

This game has a lot of systems that simply aren't fun. Encumbrance, inventory limits, fatigue, extremely punishing death effects... it's like, the loop they want you to play is:

* Start walking towards a new destination

* Random attack by pointless enemies, where the real punishment is two slow loading screens

* Almost make it, but you get fatigued

* Rest, but run out of rations because, despite being dirt cheap, rations are exceptionally heavy and inventory weight limits are pitifully low

* Get hit by an enemy and instantly and semi-permanently lose 6 dexterity until you rest again, or in some cases cast an expensive spell. 

I turned it all off. The game was more fun. Even to the point where I had the game practically in autoplay, I'm still at 81 hours with 1.5 chapters to go. I'm throwing in the towerl.

Pathfinder is a Pen and Paper(PnP) tabletop game, with quite in depth rule systems covering almost everything fantastical in a late medieval setting. Those who are familiar with Pen and Paper and Pathfinder, skip the following pharagraph.

Kingmaker is a PC adaptation of this PnP system. Now, critical point, can you enjoy the story without going into detail about the system itself? Well, sadly my answer is no. You can still play it, but knowing the system helps to enjoy the game. The game itself is not really helpful in this regard, and assumes at least a little familiarity with tabletop gaming systems. To remedy this, there are a lot of builds out there in the internet which you can copy and play a character who is reasonably powerful, and this will also help you understand the mechanics of the system. If you take a liking to this you will find yourself thinking about builds and improvements, or implementing your personal preferences.

Now, the game leads you to establish an adventurer's kingdom, in which you vanquish a foe, and start building a kingdom in these lands. I cannot stress how much I like this idea. PnP games are filled with Kingdoms established by adventurers and to be able to do this in a game is fantastic. Do not fret though, this is not a strategy game. Governance of your kingdom takes a role on the background as you gallavant around and explore dungeons and points of interests. You can completely focus on the adventuring part automating your kingdom management altogether but I strongly advice against this, managing your kingdom, accepting supplicants, and taking decisions when presented by advisors is so damn cool.

Adventuring aspect of the game sets you up against a great variety of foes, most of which are familiar to those interested in PnP Pathfinder. Even if you are not familiar, game helps you understand what they are, who they are, and how best to defeat them through Arcana skills. (Invest in yourself or at least a companion you regularly take along with you.) The combat, especially after turn-based system arrived is amazing and as you level up, your transition from a humble adventurer into a lord with overwhelming power is amazing.

Overall; if you don't like PnP and it's rules, I do not recommend this game for you. If you want to start learning about it, I strongly advise using build guides to set you on the right path. If you love and know PnP, don't skip this.",1641994454,1641994454,True,2,2,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

-Unfun kingdom management minigame you are forced to play
-time component built in to game, often takes away from exploring or having fun
-Silly perma-debuff mechanics that just add tedium. My squad of high level killers walking around with -2 constitution due to some lvl 1 lizard spitting some BS poison at me at the start of what was a planned large expedition. Need to cast restoration spell, woo having fun now. Sometimes you need to walk all the way back to your keep to sleep. Lots of fun.
-Why does every RPG care about how much you are carrying? Is inventory management fun for people? No
-All vendors sell garbage
-Most companions have garbage stats
-Need to rest like 2 times on the way to a location, otherwise you are ""exhausted"" or ""fatigued""

Overall, it seems the devs favor RPG elements over actually having fun, which is frustrating. They should focus more on making the game fun/challenging rather than tedious for the sake of roleplaying. Why is it fun to play the ""go to sleep"" minigame? It is not. Yet you are forced to play it several times just to get to one location outside of your kingdom. By the time you get there, your kingdom management timer requires you to run to bald eagle hill again to slay some low level mobs. Boring.

Overall, a solid 7/10 game. C+/B- grade. Some fun in there to be had despite the dev's best attempts to remove fun from the game in favor of RPG purism.

You need to have a good understanding of Pathfinder 1Ed rules to play this. The game explains next to nothing, doesn't provide proper references when building a character. Even worse, for things like spell lists, essential when planning your wizard's schools, they are different and are not shown anywhere. Meaning you have to go off and check online to figure out how to play.

If you have played Pathfinder and/or D&D 3.5, you can have a lot of fun with this if you're patient and are willing to deal with endless little bugs and glitches. The worst of which is one where your character can inexplicably lose their standard action. I feel I just can't recommend this game generally though, it does far too poor a job explaining anything, often leaving it far to late to pop up tutorial screens for simple things and even when they do, they are often either overly verbose or are explaining something simple/obvious or both!

Edit:
After playing more of this, I can say this is an awful, awful product propped up by the strengths of the Pathfinder/3.5 system. I'm an absolute sucker for anything to do with 3,5e, yet this game still manages to be a chore. The UX is one of the worst I've seen in a game, only things they've directly copied from other D&D based video games even competent, and they STILL managed to mess some of those up (looking at you formations), 

If you really love Pathfinder or 3.5, there's a lot of fun to be had here, if not, there are far better games in this genre more worthy of your attention; Divinity Original Sin 1&2, Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 (and I didn't even like those), Tyranny, hell, even the older games this tries to emulate are still a better experience; Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale 1 & 2 are all far superior, I've just played them to death.",1641379092,1641907344,False,4,0,0.542607963085174561,0,True,False,False

Yes, the game is hard. Yes, there’s a lot of reading involved. Yes, there are glitches and inconsistencies, but most of them have been fixed now. And yes, this game is a true old-school CRPG Baldur’s Gate spiritual successor contender.

While it’s true that I found myself more engaged with story-driven CRPGs classics like Pillars of Eternity or the Baldur’s Gate/Infinity Engine series, no other computer game has ever given me the pen & paper feeling like Pathfinder: Kingmaker.

It truly feels like a Pathfinder/D&D campaign. It feels like you’re creating, controlling and fine-tuning characters on a sheet of paper. It feels like you’re rolling dices, hoping for the best and making quick decisions as you go. The story even feels like the GM is having fun, throwing random things at you, making subtle, and not so subtle, jokes and references to other games. I know a lot of players are divided over the map and kingdom management, but to me it contributes even more to the pen & paper feeling.

This game is a true homage to old school pen & paper quests with twists and turns that just never end. I’m 100 hours in (well 99 to be exact) and judging from my readings I’m about halfway through the story and nowhere to be bored.

If you’re looking for an action RPG, this game is not for you. But if you’re looking for a party based CRPG that feels like a Pathfinder or D&D pen & paper quest, this is the game.

10/10. Can't wait to start Wrath of the Righteous!

If you're looking at a computer DnD game, you'll eventually hear about Pathfinder: Kingmaker.
On the surface, this game reminded me of classics like NwN or Baldur's Gate, with the added bonus of all the crazy shenanigans that Pathfinder added to classical DnD. And that's how I invested over 100hs on the game, testing out builds, chasing the perfect BiS items for specific classes, finishing quests.

As a time-sink, this game was worth whatever price I paid originally, but as an RPG experience I'd say I could have been better off had I never known this title.

All games have problems, and ambitious RPGs are no exception (we all still joke about Skyrim's physics), but some issues are not due to the size of the project, but due to poor direction.

PF:KM has two big issues. 
1- The story becomes convoluted and the more you advance, the less player agency you have. I'm talking about scripted character deaths, cutscenes that go against your entire build/character development, and overall degradation of the personality of the few NPCs that end up being relevant. By the last chapters of the game, I was no longer invested, and I couldn't manage to care about the ever-changing (yet always increasing) stakes.

2- The difficulty of endgame/high-level content is abysmal. This seems to be a common pitfall for DnD games that dare thread the 15+ lvl content, even if some games managed to do it correctly (NwN: Mask of the Betrayer is a great example of good execution).
You will face hordes of trash mobs doing gimmicky things just to be force you into some playstyles. From every single enemy starting at lvl 14 having AC 40+, and permanent blur/haste/similar, to all enemy attacks doing some sort of ability damage, the prevailing strategy is loading up on mass heal scrolls, greater restoration scrolls and just spam these until the encounter is over. Rinse and repeat unto the next dungeon.

There is no satisfaction in high-end combat. Going turn-base feels like a chore, and letting things progress in real-time mean either immediate elimination or getting so OverPowered your martial characters kill everything by themselves.

And forget about playing this game as a pure caster, unless you enjoy hurting yourself on a regular basis.

I've tried repeatedly to play it and never gotten further than the second act before I just dropped it out of boredom. The story isn't particularly interesting and often feels pretty directionless and I didn't like or even really dislike a single character, including the companions, they were just all so bland and soulless.
I think the biggest problem is the writing, a lot of it feels, ironically enough for a game based on a tabletop RPG, like a DM improvising. 
That's fine in a tabletop setting where you're really just there to have fun with your friends, but not when the devs have pre-written everything in advance, including the party's responses. 
Writing issues aside there are a lot of mechanical issues, not big ones but minor things, weird design choices or things that aren't explained properly that just stack up over time.
I didn't know you could sneak or inspect enemies for example until I saw it mentioned in a YouTube video on the game because it was never brought up in any of the tutorials and it's very easy to miss on the UI.
A lot of the time the quests also straight up lie or don't tell you things you desperately need to know.
For example, in the first act you need to clear a magical fog to reach the boss and once you've done the associated quests to dispel the fog it tells you 'wait for the fog to clear'. What this actually means is 'do this specific other quest which triggers an event causing the fog to clear'. This is an especially big issue considering the main quest is on a timer. 
As for the game not telling you important information, you can miss out on a certain character early on who you NEED to do some of your kingdom management stuff, without him you'll be stuck with an empty adviser slot unable to address any of the problems in your kingdom associated with that adviser's role until much later in the game when you finally get an alternative character to assign it to.

Overall the game is just painfully mediocre, I wanted to like it but I just felt like I was going through the motions. 
The silver lining is that the sequel, Wrath of the Righteous, fixes a lot of these problems and is absolutely worth playing, but unless you have a lot of tolerance for tedium, poor writing and frustration Kingmaker really isn't worth it, just skip straight to Wrath, the story is completely separate from Kingmaker anyway besides the occasional reference.",1641818487,1641818487,False,1,2,0.458592325448989868,0,True,False,False

Now, for some context: if you, like me, have not played a D&D type of game before, prepare for a lot of reading up on mechanics, background info and builds. Or just prepare to suck for a while. I have limited time, so reading up was my preferred way of approaching it. There are plenty of resources out there. Google is your friend here.

Once that's done however and you start to understand how things work (at least a basic level), this game is a lot of fun. There are plenty of ways to approach every situation, a lot of variety of character builds and combinations of them you can throw in a party and a ton of adventuring to do. The story line, kingdom management and various quests are fun and entertaining for the most part so far. You may see some repetitiveness with the kingdom management, true, but hey, it's not easy being king.

Given the myriad of options available to you, there is definitely a lot of replay value as well, as different choices tend to end up with vastly different results and echo throughout the game as you progress.

Here are the reasons why:
- main story is a slog: main story feels all over the place, disjointed, lacking focus. which would've been okay if they went a purposely open-ended ""build your own kingdom game"" route, but those mechanics are half baked as well
- side stories are unremarkable: almost no interesting side quests or companion quests, with a few exceptions
- kingdom mechanic is half baked and a chore: ended up turning it off with invincible kingdom on. it has some of the most shallow mechanics I've ever come across in a management type game
- characters are *mostly* passable at best: with exception of linzi and mr goblin, most of the characters annoyed me or made no impression at all. amiri is a charicature. valerie is insufferable. tristan's little bit is completely tacked on. I barely remember the rest

Honestly, there are some great ideas, and it's got a great foundation if you like crpgs. But it suffers from bloat - an overload of mechanics and systems that are shallow and do not mesh, a mishmash of plot ideas that dont form a cohesive narrative. if they deleted half of the mechanics and focused more on polishing the remaining half, you'd probably have an excellent game, as the crpg system beneath it all is still great.

It's pretty easily the most faithful adaptation that we've ever had of a game like this for the character creation, customization, and combat. It's just straight Pathfinder rules, which is crazy that they managed to pull it off. For the D&D folks out there, that's basically the 3.5e rule-set. So, expect it to be complicated, but freeing in terms of what you can do. 

On top of just adapting the pathfinder ruleset, the game also has a city-building aspect to it as acquire your kingdom. It's fairly simplistic, just based upon adjacencies, so i can see some people not loving it, though it's totally skippable if you want. Personally, I found it pretty fun for a long while, and when it stopped being fun it was very easy to just do it quickly. 

It also has a kingdom management mode that I think is pretty great. Basically, they'll have petitioners come to you while you hold court and ask you to make decisions. The decisions are rarely black & white, and will frequently have negative effects as well as positive making them real decisions. Like all of the diologue in this game this mode is both affected by your previous choices (alignment, skills, etc), and can have effects upon them. The other aspect of this mode is using your councillors that you pick up through decisions on the map itself to resolve issues. These are skill checks, but they use the skill that your councilor has, rather than you. I found them to be pretty fun, and not terribly repetitive even after 140 hours of play. 

The aspect that I personally found the weakest is the overland travel mode, where you travel on a map with random encounters. This started out pretty fun, but the random encounters got very very repetitive and annoying, especially when you're trying to just get back to your capital. I appreciate it being travel, rather than fast travel, but it could have used a fast-forward button so that you, the player, don't need to watch the pawn slowly travelling on the map.

You will spend most of your time reading online guides, and even those are subject to error because apparently the game has gone through some important revisions.

The world is interesting and the characters are Ok, but the experience of playing it is simply frustrating. If you don't already know how to play Pathfinder, this game isn't going to lend you hand.

Furthermore, if you aren't keyed in to how powerful enemies are, or the sometimes intricate strategies needed to beat them, you will certainly wander into more than one party wipe within the first two chapters. They aren't marked, you aren't given a headsup -- which would actually be warranted if that's the world your character grew up in, right? I may not know anything about that beast but my character might. Nope. You just die. Hope you saved!

This is to say nothing of the Strategy layer that is the kingdom. Lots of others have already spoken of it. I'll simply add, I like the idea, the execution is scattershot and confusing, but it isn't the reason I don't recommend the game.

If you are familiar with Pathfinder and really love it, then this game might suit you. But if you are only 'Pathfinder-curious' you'd better be prepared to read many guides, and then figure out how each one of them needs to be updated while you try to learn and enjoy the game.

Pros
>Obnoxiously in-depth character building system
>Genuinely good RPG writing 
>Game Big
Cons
>Class system is incomprehensible if you're not used to pathfinder. Just pick a good class for your main character and level it to 20, don't try to get cute
>Difficulty is wildly uneven; two boss fights in the same chunk of the game can be a babytown frolic and a fucking nightmare, back to back. You can change the difficulty on the fly, but having to manage it constantly is obnoxious
>Your companions never shut the fuck up about what you're doing. Considering the gimmick is that you're the Baron(ess) and they're all ostensibly loyal, you really think they wouldn't nitpick *constantly*. I guess it encourages you to have a party that mostly follows your alignment, but it's really getting on my nerves.
>Alignment system is dumb. This is one of those TTRPG tropes (along with evil/monstrous races) that I really think needs to be left behind. It feels silly to have my alignment shift seemingly at random (I don't understand how the writing distinguishes between chaotic/lawful neutral and chaotic/lawful good), and the ""evil"" options are almost all cartoonishly evil. It feels like it would take a while to have an alignment shift forced on you, which is good, because a shocking number of classes are alignment locked.

Neutral
>The character writing (and the writing in general) swerves wildly from good to...whack. Some of this is understandable, given that to my knowledge the game wasn't originally written in english, (explains stuff like characters randomly not using contractions, odd word choice, etc.) and then some of it just feels...off. My opinion on this might change as I get further in, though.

It's right there in the name - this is *Pathfinder*. It follows the rules of the TTRPG and is designed around creating an experience somewhat similar to playing the tabletop game. This means that it pretty much assumes that you understand the rules already. 

If you read the negative reviews of this game, a good majority of them focus on the opaqueness of it, since the game admittedly does give very little in the way of tutorial. This is a valid point of criticism, but not an especially powerful one. The rules are *there*, they aren't hidden, you just might have to do a little reading to fully understand the mechanic. Any level of experience with RPGs such as Divinity Original Sin (1 or 2, though the first one is the most similar) or Morrowind should be enough to allow you to understand what's happening most of the time. It works on a dice roll system, which will turn some people off. But, well, it's Pathfinder. It is exactly what it says on the tin. 

The story, though, is pretty great. The main quests, not so much, but so far it has a very interesting cast of side characters, each with their own stories and quirks and quests. You have several to choose from when it comes to forming your party, and that can even have an effect on how you are able to solve different quests and puzzles. Your dialogue choices also matter greatly, and can have some pretty profound effects over how certain quests play out, how you interact with certain NPCs, and even how your kingdom develops. -Leaving problems unsolved can actually very much come back to bite you, and doing a good deed (or bad one!) can yield results in the future in sometimes unexpected ways.

What it lacks in ease-of-entry, it more than makes up for in faithful rendition of the gameplay, colorful characters with interesting stories, a compelling overall plot, and some *killer* bagpipes during the battle music.",1641341429,1641341429,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

Prepare to spend over 200 hours wrestling with needlessly over-complicated mechanics and scheduled, you-can-lose-the-game-if-you-dont-do-this-NOW events that are neither fights nor main-story dialogue.  You can win every fight and still lose the game...  The very fact that I can lose a fantasy game that principally features combat and MAGIC without so much as a **FIGHT** simply astounds me.

You understand correctly:  I didn't fail to beat a difficult boss or encounter a puzzle I couldn't solve or lose all my gear dungeon-delving.  I *lost* the game to a digitally-portrayed sheet of parchment paper with a picture of an eagle on it.  Not to battle, no no no...  I lost the game to something that should have been a damned mini-game:  developing a fledgling feudal nation.  

Why.. oh WHY... would this game put so much emphasis on combat mechanics if you can lose the game without fighting?  Spent hours agonizing over leveling and selecting gear, all so I could lose the game to administrative issues.  

Very little emphasis was put on this ""management"" aspect of the game.  I didn't even realize what was happening until I was informed I had already lost.  It's not like you ""lose"" and then trigger some sort of final conflagration.  You just lose.  A little window pops up on the map and tells you the game is over.  My reaction:  ""Are you ****ing kidding me?""

It took me hours just to figure out what I was supposed to do, and if I wanted to do it ""correctly"" I'd have to backtrack at least 40 real hours of playtime.  I opted to load a more-recent save.  I attempted to ""play"" the game properly and try to fix my little spreadsheet nation to no avail.  

Fact is, unless you do everything correctly from the VERY start, three bad dice rolls managing the country will kill you.  Whoops, my mistake -- nothing *kills*you , you just lose.

Overall this game is great and is a decent enough representation of the tabletop experience though with things being toned down such as much fewer skills and less options for feats and class options, though this is understandable. 

The one major thing I truly can't look past at this time is that this game is NOT TURN BASED during combat nor is there an option to switch to it that I can see of. This quasi real time combat with pausing just feels aweful and not being able to see every character acting on their own turn is just complete chaos. I'm shocked this is the route that the developers chose for combat. Even with a bit of fiddling around with the pause options/controls the combat feels like such a mess.

It seems like the most unenjoyable experience to ever be had with a TTRPG. Who in their right fucking mind made this shitty combat system? This ""randomness"" is absolute dogshit, since you literally can't ever hit anything. No matter what, without fail, you will miss, that's the only sure thing about this game is that combat will be unbearable 100% of the time. I spent 30 rounds on a Giant Boar that attacked me when camping, and that stupid tower shield fighter they give you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn because the entire time I've played this game, which clearly isnt a lot, she hit a grand total of 5 times, and that's if I'm being generous. I dont understand this combat system for shit, but my understanding is that it's not like D&D 5e where you roll against flat scores, since the numbers seemed to change everytime I tried to hit an enemy, which leads me to believe they're rolling against my attacks, which sounds fucking stupid and I hope I'm wrong. I really just think there no way to modify your rolls, so its a ""you hit in on a scale of 1-20. if it has a 17+ you're fucked and not hitting this, period."" kind of situation, and that's infuriating. Do you know how annoying it is to just want to play one of these games for the combat more than the story itself, and have it be completely unplayable?

All of these games have been cited as channelling similar experiences to that of Baldur's Gate and the other Infinity Engine games, but nowhere is it more clear than in Kingmaker. Not only does it use the Pathfinder ruleset (based heavily off D&D 3.5), but the pure unfiltered viciousness with which it applies these rules is very reminiscent of the first Baldur's Gate. Those who are fans of classic cRPGs will most definitely find a lot to love in this game, as I did.

First off, to address the fact that every original review of this game calls it a broken, buggy mess - Owlcat has fixed it. You may encounter some bugs, as with all games in this genre, but it'll never crash, you'll never be locked out of content you shouldn't be, and everything will pretty much work as intended.

Kingmaker is hard. It's really, really hard. The combat, the character building, the seen and unseen consequences of your actions, the time management - it leaves you with a lot of careful thinking to do. However, there are VAST difficulty options and you can also check out Nexus Mods for even more difficulty options and general tricks to make the game a bit more player-friendly. You can also pump those settings up to your hearts content, creating a game where the only way to survive is to create optimal builds and to use the best possible tools available to you. There's also a Kingdom management aspect to the game which can take up a large chunk of your time if you let it. However, you can also set it to Auto in options or download the Kingdom Resolution mod to tune it to your liking.

Kingmaker is well written. I know a lot of the content here was inspired by and pulled directly from the original Pathfinder adventure path but Owlcat's writing here is really good. The characters are all solid, and the opportunities to actively roleplay are off the charts. Alignment has a LOT of impact on your character, which is kind of the opposite of what Baldur's Gate 3 is doing, but honestly I really enjoy Owlcat's method.

The most important part of a cRPG for many people is the companions - are they memorable? Are they well written? Do they grow and develop and have their own storylines? Do those storylines branch off into alternative endings? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. Kingmaker's companions may start out as seemingly one-note and forgetful, but as the game goes on, they develop into unique beings (albeit slowly) that operate independently of the player. Standouts for me were Kaessi, Nok Nok, Jaethal, and Jubilost. The antagonists were all fantastic.

Kingmaker is LONG. It took me about 150 hours on my first playthrough, playing on Normal difficulty. Even then, I left large amounts of the map unexplored, many quests unfinished, and many alternate paths not taken. The game takes place over years and you really do feel the progression of time as eventually characters start talking about events as if they were years ago - and they really were. It took me 6 months to beat the game, which is a while for me, but its fairly slow paced and I often went a few weeks without playing, then I'd play for an hour and get hooked for another three weeks.

Kingmaker feels like an adventure. One big problem I have with a lot of cRPGs is that it doesn't capture that same sense of journey and grandness that the Infinity Engine games did. Kingmaker truly succeeds at this, and it was a joy to experience for the first time.

The downsides to this game are as the other reviews put it - Kingmaker is certainly out to get you. It applies rules and tools from a tabletop RPG in a cRPG without the Dungeon Master present that is needed to keep all those tools and rules under check - to make sure the game is fun for the players. Often, Kingmaker is just frustrating. But I adored it anyway.

If you're interested in this game, go for it. If the downsides are making you a bit wary, try Wrath of the Righteous instead. It improves on Kingmaker in just about every way, but this wonderful game is still worth playing.",1641198091,1641198091,True,12,0,0.634745895862579346,0,True,False,False

Unless that's your thing stay away from this game of Pathfinder.

As soon as you leave the tutorial area the balance for the combat ruins the game, the fights are downright unfair, pitting you against so many enemies that all you can do is reload and hope the dice fall in your favor and those are the easiest you will experience. There is a story mission in which you need to fight a Bear Treant with DR which you don't have the tools to bypass and which attacks 3 times per round and can easily one shot most of your party members. For some reason this is considered by the devs to be a fair challenge for a level 2 party and to make matters worse this apparently after a balance adjustment in which the Creative Director addressed this specific fight as needing to be reevaluated. If it's this hard now I can't imagine what this looked like before being ""balanced."" 

When you do actually get through the insane difficulty curve and win a few fights the rewards and XP gain are measly. I referenced the rulebooks for pathfinder to see if my problems are to blame and no, I was fighting a CR8 encounter at level 2, which should award me a mountain of XP for my efforts, but not in this game apparently.

On top of all the completely unbalanced encounters occasional glitches that stop you from finishing your standard action (attacks and spells) after moving effectively waste your turn, which you really cannot afford to have wasted with the difficulty as high as it is. 

Maybe this game can be made remotely enjoyable with mods but I can't bring myself to bash my head against the wall any longer. The vanilla game here, is a lesson on how not to balance CRPG combat.",1641165519,1641165519,False,4,0,0.524944663047790527,0,True,False,False

Well, it's fine, I do recommend it, but it is no ""masterpiece"", just a good game.

The story is lifted more or less straight from the P&P module, and the presentation is fine for a first game from a dev and a KickStarter game. The writing is fine, if wonky here and there, but I suspect it is lost in translation, and not just language, rather than incompetence. Given where the devs are located, the game's story, writing and several characters are pushing the limits of ""accepted"".

The visuals are the modern crpg lacklustre Unity-look, and they do the job just fine. The music ranges from excellent to annoying, and a lot of cues are ""borrowed"", as to not infringe on copyrights, from other games and series. This can be very jarring at times, if you know your games music and composers...
The VA's do just fine, some I'd even call ""excellent"", but the game is not fully voiced, and it can be jarring to go from voiced conversation to reading and back to voiced in the span of a few minutes. Unfortunately, the VO cannot be turned off, despite the devs having promised to patch in the option.

The gameplay and rules are not exactly lifted straight from P&P, but adapted, at times simplyfied, and really pushed to the limit on the harder difficulties. If you like punishing gameplay and min-maxing, this is for you. If you like a fair challenge, the difficulty can be ajusted to allow for role-playing and a good time.

Then there is length.
A playthrough is 100 hours or more if you play Turn Based rather than Real Time with Pause, and how much of a completionist you are.
It is too long, I'll admit.
The story drags on by the end, and at least one of the 9 chapters could be cut and you wouldn't miss anything. The last chapter is a jrpg-style boss-rush and really out of place, and the penultimate one is a chore and still buggy a.f.

Read the online narratives for character building or else you will get nowhere and like myself, have a main character that is useful for little else than being a pack mule. 

It's simply no good jumping into this game thinking that a half-orc will make a decent barbarian or an elf a well-rounder ranger. There are so many additional levels of character creation which the game itself unfortunately does a poor job of assisting you with. 

It looks very polished and plays well. The regular need for resting ironically becomes tiring for the player to sit through. Worst (and I'll admit that this is likely to be a result of my poor character choices) is with the combat. I don't believe that in my 29th year of playing RPGs on the PC platform, that I have ever come across such a binary level of opposition. Either you absolutely pummel the enemies into a bloody mess, or effectively watch your team be massacred by an enemy that you have no understanding or appreciation for until its too late and you're dead. ""Is a were-rat a pushover or a difficult enemy to face off against?"" Turns out that my team just discovered that it was the latter.

Ranged combat, certainly at lower levels of proficiency is INFURIATING. Almost to the point that I'd suggest not even having a ranged character in your team. Even if by blind luck, your archer hits the enemy - chances are they would have done more damage if the arrow had been a potato.

I've seen enough of the game to see some glimpses of design genius poking through. The quality and passion of the production are clearly there to appreciate - but you have to commit (and submit) to the unyielding game mechanics that more often than not, you learn from the hard way.

Apparently Avellone worked on this game, I don't know in which capacity, but writing is just a bit better and more mature than that in Divinity: Original Sin 2;

Setting is your generic fantasy, with lore that's hardly unique.

My experience seems to be vastly different from everyone else's. Generally speaking I roll on the lower end, but on this game I'm getting results in the extremes. My roll patterns are vastly different from other dice rolling games, and I've played a lot.

Enemies appear to be over tuned or under tuned. Some enemies are pathetic and don't do anything at all and provide zero challenge while many other enemies you may encounter even at level 4 will have, for example, a +17 to attack, with a built in trip that always hits (worgs), and just have more AC and hit bonuses than they do in the rulebooks. The adjusted enemies are not fun to deal with and I don't like how Owlcat seemed to rebalance a lot of enemies. 

Some enemies you run into at level 3 or 4 will see a level 7+ multi-classing with 4 levels in one class, and 3 levels in another. Sometimes they'll be a challenge, sometimes they wont. This is extremely confusing game design.

For me this makes the game as a whole frustrating to play. I feel like I'm fighting the system more than the enemies. I hear once you get to level 10 things stop becoming a challenge. Honestly the biggest issue about this game in my *personal experience* (highlighting for emphasis) seems to be balance issues of this kind.

The kingdom building aspect is fun. The maps and graphics are nice, and the music and characters are also well done.

However, I am not you. Its worth it to buy on a sale and test it out for yourself. I dislike it, but will likely continue to play out of stubbornness because I really really love d20 based games like this, DOS2, KOTOR/II, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, etc. It has become stressful to play, though, which is not a good sign for me.

Good turn based fighting, character development, loot mechanics, monster variation etc. The fact that it looks great with the armor you just got displayed in the 3D world makes it even better.

I've reduced the difficulty from normal to story just to finish the slog of the last chapter (yes, balance is so bad i don't even want to talk about the combat). The pen and paper version of Pathfinder generally has you doing much much less encounters per level, but this is a video game with plenty of trash mobs. Trash mobs that can all spam cast fear, insanity, and pile on negative levels and stats that YOU CANNOT REMOVE without a priest, cleric, appropriate spell. End game you have enough money and rations to just camp whenever, but in one fight this game will spam you with 12 ghosts that all fear you at once (enjoy THAT Will save). And I've followed optimized leveling builds this whole time as well - oh and AI? Will never cast anything on your team besides haste, even when you tell it to cast buffs freely and not ignore limited spells. You need to pour through your entire teams spellbooks every fight, in this shitty UI interface, and god help you if you did not pick the right spells when leveling. Blind fighting is mandatory. 

Let's talk about the storyline now. If you don't follow it in just the right arbitrary way, people will die and you get suboptimal endings. Every villain that has murdered your teammates and innocents, if you don't always spare them and act like a goody twoshoes idiot, you will not get the perfect ending. Always act like a drooling lawfulgood robot. Just roll paladin and be done with it. Example - one guy, Tristian, you must have always said the perfect thing and advanced his story, and either made him a friend or a lover, by a certain point in the story. Otherwise, with no option or chance for redemption, he will screw you out of the best ending, and you will then be expected to forgive him and take him back. If you don't, you will have an advisor slot empty for the rest of the game. Yeah.. DnD is supposed to be about roleplaying alignments and characters. This just sucks. 

Devs, you could have been forgiven for following the pen and paper version of pathfinder too closely, but you add on difficulty by ADDING AC and levels and spells and over-optimizing enemies that you just throw at us for no reason. This is a game for masochists only. Just play it on story and set the kingdom mode to the easiest level.

Melee hits, ranged hits, magic hits, etc. all miss round after round. There is a lot of combat and moving, so this is very frustrating. Luckily there are mods available that can fix this and make the game playable.

But then at about mid-game the stupid puzzles start that require help from the online community. But then I got to one that even the community has difficulty explaining as it was so complicated. It involved standing on different colored plates to open different colored doors in a maze of a dungeon. For example, this blue plate opens that blue door, but not the other one. Need to find the white plate to open the door where the other blue plate is, etc. etc. Why is it that in many RPG games the developers feel compelled to ruin their games by putting such stupid anti-logical puzzles in them.

Despite Owlcat's best efforts, and they have done a solid job of trying to translate Pathfinder 1st ed into computer format, the feel and balance are just wrong. I mainly feel on the balance end of this. The problem is the game runs off a tabletop RPG system, one that is meant to have a human DM running the game. Not to mention that the rest of your party is also supposed to be made of live people, each with their own character. But the human element that makes the system work is absent and is instead replaced by a soulless computer who is either too easy or too punishing. This game is not forgiving of slight character building mistakes, or role playing choices. A live DM who isn't a jerk aims to be in your corner at least a little bit and doesn't want your party to be dead, because in the tabletop, there is no reloading saves, and if the players die too much, no one is going to want to play. In this game there is reloading saves, so perhaps that was their excuse to make a lot of the encounter's in this game of luck really punishing since, ""the player can just reload."" Speaking of the party, the companions are alright but they end up being one note for the most part, plus if you want to have a certain class combination in your party, you can't have it unless you use mods. Perhaps this game is like a bethesda title, where mods are pretty magical and make the game far more enjoyable but I've run out of patience to keep doing the intro over for like the 4th time. I would like to say that Owlcat did the best they probably could trying to make this system and story work on a computer or console, but ultimately it just doesn't work. If you want my advice, try and find a group of people running a real d20 table top game, or get your friends to try it. If that's not an option, then I would recommend you look at other CRPGs that don't try and use D20 rules.

If this type of personal hell of your own construction sounds like your idea of a good time, by all means, this is the game for you.

The combat can be fun and challenging, and with the vast amount of magical items, character customization, and personalization are virtually infinite. The character creation and leveling system is probably the most in-depth version of any edition of DnD, and is wildly addicting. Pathfinder is my favorite, and they somehow managed to pull it off in video game. The turn-based mode option is a must for me, and I'm glad they added in to the official version. There is enough adventure in this game to last you many many hours although a lot of the locations are obviously cut and paste. 

That being said, the main flaw of this game, besides the whatever plot, is the Kingdom system. I hate base building, especially the kind that doesn't really explain progression, and can Game Over your playthrough if you get it wrong 50 hours in (I'm looking at you Xcom). It's tedious, hampers the traditional exploration of the map by making you go back and micromanage BS every few weeks in game time. You can set it to Auto, but I wish it wasn't in the game.

However, the game just seems far too punishing to be fun.  There are many design choices that err on the side of the lore / game and not the player.  Why after killing a group of spiders do I have to stand in the middle of their spawned webs and keep rolling to move with no enemies present?  Why can't I just use my torch (or any fire spell) to remove them.. or how about just make them disappear assuming the party figured it out? Idiotic design choice that punishes the player for no reason.  Why are some encounters needlessly difficult?  There might be a mechanism to pre-judge the difficulty of an encounter and not waste my time... I could not find it.  Yes I see that you can ""inspect"" but without knowing what you are reading you don't know that this group of monsters will destroy you easily.  Occasionally spells just don't work at all or as expected.  Timing of movement, attacks, and spells makes no sense to me.  I see that you can reduce the difficulty at any time... that just feels lazy.  Give me the tools and information I need and I should not need to reduce the difficulty.

Its not a complete waste though.  I liked the various management screens, pop up info boxes, world map exploration, and the character development.

I'm sure there are people who really like this game and appreciate it for what it is... but having played and finished DOS2 and early access BG3 recently... compared to them, this is a fail.  Those games love the player AND give a challenging tactical experience with engaging lore and beautiful visuals.

A tip for newcomers, just put your party members on auto-level, I've spent too much time on character creation/leveling, and put kingdom management on auto.
Bringing whole Pathfinder system to a video game was a mistake IMO, you have the good and the bad, it does not translate well all aspects since it was born as a tabletop RPG, the randomness is a pain, you' ll need to save scum, even if you really just want some loot or a good roll on some conversation check, some classes do practically nothing just attack with a weapon (in tabletop you can role play and is free to do whatever). I also would really like more interaction between members of the party outside camping, game falls short in this aspect.

I think this is what leads to so many CRPGs being of above average quality. Developers tend to make these games because they are passionate about them, not because they're chasing the newest trend or trying to capitalize on the latest big hit.
 the two Pathfinder games, particularly WotR, really stand out even in this comparatively small field. From a design perspective they tick almost every box fans of the genre are looking for. Even the areas where they achieve less universal praise like Kingdom or Crusade management are at least attempts to bring something new to a genre that doesn't usually get a whole lot of innovation. Anything Owlcat makes from this point on is going to be on my radar, Pathfinder or otherwise.

In my opinion Wrath of the righteous is the most epic crpg since the second baldurs gate and Divinity original sin 2

Honestly for my first time, would probably explain why I had so much to dislike about this game and I made a lot of dumb decisions. Second time I played this game, came in with low expectations and, it was better to say the least, but I still got some things to say and I still, in the end uninstalled it cause I had no fun with this game. Lets start with the good things first. It's pathfinder, this system is pretty fun and coming with this system is in-depth character creation, which is one of my favorite things to do. Sure, visual wise there is not much variety, (especially in the portraits) but I like grabbing my feats and skills and all of that. Second, some of the party members in this game are pretty neat, I like the sisters Kaessi or whatever their names are, (sadly heard they were dlc so sorry to the people who do not have their dlc,) Octavia and Regongar (Regongar is such a silly name) are a pretty cool duo and I like their backstory, and Amari is pretty cool. The setting is honestly awesome and I love the scenery. And that kind of concludes all of the positive things I remember about. 
Now the Negative:
Its hard as balls, on all difficulties, and it really ticks me off most of the time. They would send much harder enemies to you whenever you are under-leveled and expect you to defeat them (i.e. the technic league, had to go on super easy mode to defeat them and I am not proud of that)  and they would send you Main character on a lot of quests alone, and then send hard enemies while you are alone. Basically you now have to start playing to see if you can even survive the next battle. You have to start multiclassing and trying your best to spread all of your characters thin and give them the best skills possible just to make it, some people may like that, but personally I do not. I like to build to my style, to my style of fun (in this case, a barbarian with like 25 AC, btw, it boggles my mind on how even the enemies can hit you consistently at 25 freaking AC) and the voice acting is good in a lot of cases, but in cases like Regongar where one of his lines are ""Die for me?"" If you ask why for the question mark, its because he has a rising tone for that and its honestly just really silly cause he makes a line thats supposed to be intimidating just silly. Anyways, back to the more negative. The kingdom running, main reason why I got this game, its midpar. Its certainly not the best and in times its just not good. They sometimes give you missions or trouble that, like before, is really, really difficult to complete at the level you are at during that point. Its pretty infuriating and it helped in the reason on why I uninstalled this game again. Finally, the part that I dislike the most, the beginning. Sweet lords of Iron I hate the beginning with a burning passion. Its slow, its entirely difficult from time to time for no reason, you are on a time limit which sucks and can sometimes glitch out for no reason and cause you to lose the game immediatley, and the story in this section is not great. It also helps with how dumb the baron (or whoever the queen lady is) in the beginning, if you are a good character and you can easily tell that Tartuccio is a conniving little scumbag and not fall for his ploys, you could have avoided this whole race for baronhood, but guess what, queeny thinks you are still the mole, with what evidence that can't easily be proven wrong? Anyways, that's how I feel about this game. Should you buy it? Well you are more patient than me and if you are more ok dealing with some things in here that is bs, go ahead, I bet you will have a good time.

+:
хорошая вариативность, очень понравились ответы в диалогах ""по мировоззрению"", действительно можно отыграть разных персонажей; хотя местами хотелось бы побольше возможностей выбора, например, в доп. квестах;
крутые спутники! персонажи прописаны прекрасно, чувствуются их характеры, они ""встревают"" в различные диалоги по ходу игры, взаимодействуют между собой, однако было бы еще лучше, если бы в целом этого взаимодействия было больше;
приятная глазу графика, причем не очень требовательная!;
шикарная механика управления и развития королевства, лично я такого еще нигде, особенно в рпг, не встречал (хотя управлять королевством - та еще запара, у меня в этом первом прохождении идеально развить королевство не получилось, к сожалению. но все еще впереди!);

из минусов могу выделить :
малое количество диалогов со спутниками на различные темы, хотя в игре происходит много событий, на которые можно было бы прописать еще парочку диалогов;
локаций много, но большинство их них одинаковые в буквальном смысле, отличаются только мобы и лут. как по мне, - лучше меньше, но насыщеннее!;
длс довольно скучноваты, хотя начало и середина ""Varnhold's lot"" очень даже ничего;
сюжетую ветку с Ироветти можно было и поинтереснее сделать...очень уж персонаж интересный;
ЧЕРТОВО ограничение по времени, которое я ненавижу всей душой. тебя постоянно торопят по сюжету, времени на развитие королевства не хватает, из-за чего ты постоянно на нервах. лично для меня - это САМЫЙ серьезный минус. было очень непривычно все время следить за временем и бомбить из-за его нехватки. с одной стороны, это, конечно, интересно придумано, реалистично и все такое, но блин, КАК ЖЕ Я НЕНАВИЖУ ЭТО ОГРАНИЧЕНИЕ!!! (аж три восклицательных знака, да!). в следующее прохождение моды, что ли, поставить...

Ладно, в целом, как я уже говорил, все минусы чисто субъективны, но из-за них я ставлю только 8 из 10.

The game, and I say this as a veteran of D&D of some 10 odd years now, is just too damn hard and not in a good way.
My sneak attack mage? won't sneak attack a lot of the time, why? I'll never know, you'll never know. Does 3 damage instead cool beans guys.
Will o wisp? ok 50 hours in or whatever I can finally fight a few of them cool, never mind they showed up like 10 hours into the game. Now they are the trash mobs. Trash mobs that are harder to hit than my shadow assassin/mage with bonus to displacement and 18 dex. Oh they two shot my death knight tank still because of course they do.
Whole screen full of this sort of wolf or that sort of wolf like creatures, If a single one of them lands a single hit you fall prone no matter what characters you've built, standing up is instant death in Pathfinder, laying prone is instant death in Pathfinder. Even if every character you had did nothing but full blast AOE they have too much health to ever take down before one of them lands a single hit at some point.
Constitution poison damage starts ticking, why? I'll never know, you'll never know. Is it the giant slugs off in the distance? is it the fog? I'll never know, you'll never know.
Picked up rather unique seeming companion. Two for one kind of hot cool lets bang. Start to use her to replace one of my other less impressive companions. Does shit damage and has to use a whole turn action every 3 rounds of shit damage or she has to fall back to using a cross bow. Why is this character so shit? why make such a build a showcase? I'll never know, you'll never know.
Kingmaker is alright until it's not. Why did you die? should you even be in this area? it sent you to this area(?), are you about to lose the game because you took to long to accomplish some random seemingly unimportant event? I'll never know, you'll never know. If you were a hard core Pathfinder playing irl pick this game up and all DLC on sale. If you are the saltiest of salty boys and have a neck beard so full and long you haven't seen the ground in years you'll still get wiped or randomly lose the game because you forgot to pause the pause menu but hey at least some of the time you'll have enough experience under you belt to occasionally know why. It's pretty deep if you run enough mods and you can remedy some of it's many flaws but without years of game mod and pen and paper Pathfinder experience under your belt this game is going to be unplayable.

I've been playing tabletop RPGs for the better part of the last three decades, and I've been playing CRPGs for almost as long. The presentation on this blew me away. The Pathfinder system is excellent - all of the good things from Dungeons and Dragons, none of the bad. Voice acting, environments, spell effects, monster design, worldbuilding - all of that's fantastic, really immersive and exciting.

Sadly, the kingdom management side of things butchers the pacing, making things feel either too fast or too slow. I'm not a fan of the overworld map or camping system. Inventory management is a MASSIVE chore. The game is crying out for some quality of life improvements (gold rings shouldn't stack individually...) and clearly needed a little longer in the oven. For example, the flanking and sneak attack mechanics are, frankly, ridiculous. Give everybody a level of vivisectionist and the game breaks.

By the time you deal with the trolls (the second story arc of EIGHT), you'll probably have had enough. I get that they wanted it to feel like a tabletop RPG where you could just go and do your own thing if you wanted (and face the consequences!), but PC gamers tend to want clarity on their responsibilities and enforcing a Game Over 40+ hours in for poor kingdom management is unforgivable when the system is integrated and explained so badly.

I wanted to love you, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, but Owlcat should have a look at something like Tyranny and learn some lessons about how to be a bit punchier - or at something like Pillars of Eternity and learn some lessons about how to be a bit more user-friendly. There's a gem buried in the rock here, but they couldn't quite hew it out. A valiant effort, but not quite enough.",1639239267,1639837370,False,1,0,0.468976795673370361,0,True,False,False

[b] EDIT [/b]

This game wins RPG for life, I successfully integrated humanoids and monster races in a free religion and speech state. Shrines to Lamashtu (CE goddess of monster and power, exist next to shrines of iomedae, goddess of light and might) all gods are respected as long as there are no human sacrifices or teachings against the state.

No oppression against the populace is tolerated. No religious zealotry is tolerated. Trolls, Kobolds, Giants, and Goblins exist in ""The Free Lands of Arcadia"" as well as Fey. My royal court includes an LE undead inquisitor, CN half orc magus as the warden, a doomsayer CN cleric as head priest, LN diplomats, CG cultural artisans and NG public officials. Even have CE representatives for lamashtu and a priestess of lamashtu in the court. The local lizard tribes, mite tribes, troll tribes and kobold tribes don't hunt humans.

Giants are in the military and construction. Powerful magical constructs stand guard over the citizens. Freedom of speech and independent printing presses are abundant. Orphanages and shrines to desna (goddess of adventures and the poor) exist on the roads. Varisian caravans (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) feed intel to me and patrol the roads during their travels.

I have every creed, race, faith, and alignment existing at once with very little conflict. Chaotic Neutral (when not run by a psychotic asshat) is the BEST

as long as it's consensual and your not; oppressing anyone, enslaving anyone, hate criming, sedition against the state. The state will guarantee your safety and support in crisis

На самом деле, времени я потратил меньше, так как иногда игра просто стояла, пока я уставший шёл лежать на диван. Бросил я игру не на пустом месте -- сломались сейвы, похоронив пару часов прогресса. С учётом моего таймера, пара часов это недолго, но я понял, что это идеальный момент остановиться.

Во-первых, утомила общая затянутость игры. Сюжет в игре тянулся и тянулся, а ещё утомило отсутствие какого-то фокуса, простой и понятной центральной загадки. Вместо того, чтобы с самого начала пояснить, чего будем разгадывать, сценарий набрасывает какие-то королевства, политику, а вот ты будешь крайний посередине, а вот эти хотят захватить этих... Затем идёт вторая глава, третья, четвёртая, а сюжет всё ещё можно выразить фразой ""вот есть баронство, а вот ему мешают быть"". Кульминацией главы обычно служит подземелье; так вот что ни финальное подземелье, то скучное и затянутое, состоящее сплошь из битв, от которых я регулярно уставал. Из-за того, что каждая глава это в большей степени самостоятельное препятствие баронству, я никогда не чувствовал удовлетворение от его завершения. Вот какая-то беда, вот она закончилась, какой ужас.

Само баронство представлено карточной игрой, где нужно захватывать области, застраивать в них города и решать проблемы, иначе характеристики баронства упадут и игра закончится. Так вот, эта часть, внезапно, меня тоже демотивировала -- я люблю такие простенькие менеджеры, но в баронство легко проиграть. Игра активно наказывает за промахи и запоздалые решения, но почти не даёт шансов искупить их. В итоге, стоит баронству скатиться в -4, выбраться оттуда будет как минимум крайне сложно, ведь все советники получают огромный штраф к решению проблем. Практически каждая проблема становится нерешаемой, отчего вы либо пытаетесь её решить и скорее всего вас накажут, либо игнорируете её, и тогда вас точно накажут. Большую часть времени игра не даёт разобраться с бедами баронства -- за одной сюжетной аркой обычно сразу же идёт следующая, с новой порцией бед. В итоге, сюжет тянулся и тянулся, дела в баронстве становились всё хуже, я включил режим бессмертного королевства, но настроение уже было испорчено, так как в небольшой кусок игры я уже проиграл.

Ну и есть ворох бед по мелочи: всё ещё можно сломать сейвы, воскрешённые напарники остаются лежать трупами, что ни босс, то тварь с безумно заниженным шансом попадания. Ещё разработчики порой тяготеют к одноразовым механикам, видимо ради разнообразия. Например в одном месте нужно тушить костры заклинанием (вообще неочевидно и нигде больше не нужно), в паре других мест попадаются рои врагов (пару раз в начале, где их нужно уничтожать особым образом, пару раз в середине, где они настолько слабые, что уже без разницы, как уничтожать).

Несмотря на это, какие-то вещи меня всё-таки держали в игре. Это некоторые сюжетные арки, почти замечательные русские тексты (хотя местами всё же слишком высокопарные, где каждый простолюдин, аки герой Дюма, распинается в витиеватых и экспрессивных фразах, краснея и бледнея, бросаясь к ногам, и чьё лицо розовеет, стоит барону, согласиться на его скромную, почти пустяковую просьбу), неплохие локации.

На мой взгляд, игру надо было сделать в два раза короче. Сократить сюжетные подземелья, ускорить перемещение по карте процентов хотя бы на двадцать (прокачка области конями не в счёт), вместо комплекта рационов на человека ввести лагерный комплект сразу на всю команду (плюс напоминать в городе закупиться ими), дать больше возможностей выбраться из ямы плохого баронства. Даже чёрт с ним с сюжетом, чья фабула укладывается в одно предложение; если бы игра закончилась хотя бы десять часов назад, я бы со скрипом, но отозвался бы о ней тепло. Но имеем что имеем, и для меня Pathfinder: Kingmaker это душевная, симпатичная, но при том кривая и крайне затянутая CRPG.",1639426186,1639426186,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I love that it has turn-based combat as that's my preferred style, I also like that there are other options since at some point I may want to speed it up, at least for less-challenging encounters.

There are bugs to be found but amazingly few given the complexity, mostly they are little things and don't crop up often at all. Ironically one of the systems I found most temperamental was the pathfinding - extra attention is required to make characters move the way you want around boundaries.

Story overall was great, clearly got a lot of attention in development and can branch out in a lot of different ways while following the core thread. Very occasionally it did feel like it was getting in the way of the game a bit, could be a little too unpredictable and toward the end I kind of felt like it was dragging a bit.

-Character customization is very rich and sometimes can be overwhelming but there is a pre-build option available for almost every character in game! So if you become more familiar you can create your unique character.
-Story: every quest is very engaging. There is a lot of side quests and and so far for me every one was unique so the game does not get boring after 40+ hours of gameplay,
-Combat: on tougher difficulty levels you better have a good plan when fighting foes. And believe me... if you travel into the unknown better have a diverse type of party to be able to handle any kind of threat or in an emergency situation escape from it.

Also, I hope that it will be helpful to some new players considering renewed interest in this game.

Started playing Kingmaker around a year or so after the initial lunch of the game so didn't really have many problems considering bugs or huge performance issues. At first playing real-time with pause was kind of hard to get a hang of (it's been really long since I played cRPGs in general) but after some trial and error, it's not bad at all! Although was really happy when the turn-based mode was added. Now, if you are new to the Pathfinder system (as I was at the time) I strongly recommend playing the first run on turn-based mode and checking the log after every action. Really helped me understand the mechanics and how different actions react to each other.

The first playthrough I did was really all over the place. I haven't checked guides or anything and thought to myself that I'm a fairly experienced cRPG/DnD player (spent much time playing Neverwinter and the likes at a time). And was I wrong, let me tell you. Started playing on normal, and yes, it was not normal. :) After realizing that I don't understand the Pathfinder system at all or DnD that good for the matter, I switched to easy mode. After that change, I had a blast playing the game! Finished my first playthrough and had a great time. So much so, that after that I started another run on normal because I was really interested in mechanics after seeing how things kind of work. Also, the story has good replayability, so that was another plus (the first time I didn't recruit two companions because I didn't even know where are they). After playing on normal I thought that is that. Anyhow, a few months later I started another run this time on the modified hard difficulty. And I  managed it without too much hassle to be honest. TLDR, for anybody starting the game for the first time. Play on easy (it's hard enough to feel like you had to work for something) and learn the Pathfinder system. If it's too easy at some point, just bump difficulty it up.

One tip for playing on harder difficulties, always have restoration, death ward, and freedom of movement scrolls/spells prepared and give every companion blind fight feat for immunity to gaze attacks.

Mechanics aside, I personally think that the story is more than great! Didn't really have experience with tabletop adventure and haven't looked up guides (for the first playthrough) and was pretty amazed by the general story, plot development, and general feel and atmosphere of the game. Definitely felt like I was exploring the world, getting to hang out with my companions, and just living out some kind of a fairy tale. Would not go too much into companions because too each their own. Personally had a great time with some of them and some not so. After completing the game, I was kind of sad that the story had ended so I guess that is a sign of a compelling story! I strongly suggest not to spoil your first playthrough with walkthrough guides or build guides! Just make your character your own and live out your adventure.

The game is fairly long with one part adventuring and one part kingdom management. The general consensus is that the management part isn't that good or polished, but then again it is kind of important for the whole story. Personally, I generally liked it as a casual break from adventuring and played it on both normal and easy difficulties. After that experience, I would recommend just setting kingdom management to easy/effortless. Had some really, really frustrating experiences with harder difficulties when RNG is just not on your side. Also, build teleportation circles the first chance you get because it will make your life much simpler. Regarding adventuring/questing order, which to me was really upside down at first. It turns out that doing main quests first is the way to go, and after that doing all the other quests lines and companion quests. After wrapping my brain around that, everything became less frustrating, because some timed quests will fail otherwise. In general, do the main quest first, then the companion quest, and after that all other quests.

Overall adventuring experience was interesting, engaging, and generally really fun. To me, two points really got me frustrated on every playthrough. The first one is the puzzles (including mist for changing levels states) which I find to be overly confusing. It feels like there is no good indicator implemented to help you solve puzzles aside from just a trial and error approach. The second one is the final part of the game that just has some really bad encounter designs to be perfectly honest. I don't have some smart solution on how to fix it but just be prepared that it will be a test for your patience.

With everything said and done, I have to say that this is probably my favorite game that I have played! It manages to spark your imagination and take you away for a long time.

If you are the target audience for this game (played 100+ hours of 2nd and 3rd Edition D&D video games) you know EXACTLY what you are getting. This is a nice black-and-white carbon copy of those older games: all the granularity (and more!) of the original, but not much of the character.
 
The writing has clearly been done by many authors who all have varying voices, but not too many surprises between them. Many of the characters are abrasively one-note (each in their own way!) and the only companion who I thought had a competent writer (Jaethle) was the one who spoke the least in my playthrough. A lot of the writing is really lacking fun expressions and good, juicy dungeon dressing fluff. Sometimes the dialogue will have the characters' action as well as dialogue, sometimes it will be dialogue only. Reading the game is a bumpy ride through broad characters, some trope-y enough to basically break the fourth wall. I wish the game had a style guide instead of one of the 40 class options.

The most intriguing part of the game is how it tries to emulate an old-fashioned hexcrawl. And it does, pretty well! It's just that it's emulating a BAD hexcrawl, where this hex has (*dice clatter*) a water elemental, and you can barely beat that! And this hex has (*dice clatter*) a troll, and you can't beat that for five more levels! And this hex has (*dice clatter*) two goblin archers that couldn't credibly threaten a level 1 character! Oh boy!

....Which is to say, the world never related back into itself much at all. What gods mattered? What places were important here? What clues didn't just lead to the next quest point, but also revealed something interesting about another part of the world? Every quest and encounter either actually was modular or felt like it. To be fair, I guess, most of the quests I completed were fetch quests. I can't remember much of the world or the levels, except for the one chapter-ender I played through.

That one level I remember was way too long and had some consequences for my choices that made the ending very abrupt and uncinematic. It had a clever-enough mechanic of playing factions in the level against each other. Puzzle-wise, that was about as complicated as it got. 

Encounters feel same-y because there are too many boring regular regular encounters, enemies often act the same and dogpile the low-HP character, and even if you are hitting often, the way the game flashes your rolls onscreen will make you remember all the you-totally-blew-an-important-roll-by-rolling-a-2-when-all-you-needed-was-a-3 moments much more than you will remember any crits. So combat doesn't usually feel rewarding doing it. And looting is generic Baldur's Gate loot, featuring constant streams of +1 longswords, chainmail, and medium shields; have fun picking through that trash. So combat doesn't feel rewarding after you've won. There isn't even a success jingle, it abruptly launches you back into normal exploration mode.

This is a very workmanlike game. The creators knew exactly what they wanted to do, and here it is. This game as an update to Baldur's Gate is very much like Pathfinder as an update to D&D 3rd Edition: The old systems weren't pushing anything new, both 3rd Edition and BG were trying to clean up Dungeons and Dragons by adding video game technology, in a large but hopefully-easier-to-swallow update to the game. Pathfinder -the system- and Pathfinder -this game- both decided not to update or innovate on their previous chasses [is that the plural of chassis? Chassises? Chassoi?], but instead added layers upon layers of ornate cruft, suffocating you in crunchy content that all tastes the same, because that's funner rite, more is more is more

If you already know Pathfinder or 3rd Ed D&D, you can play this just fine. If you don't know Pathfinder, just play this game to get a high-lighted tour of absolutely garbage systems design. In the highly technical, very niche jargon of the modern game scholar/auteur/technician/""designer"", the Pathfinder system is planet Car-Wrexia, the junkyard capitol planet of the Effluvium galaxy. There are a trillion different tiny systems and abilities that have all the same little numbers but apply to all sorts of different things that sometimes relate but mostly don't, oh and that's per day but that's spell slots, no a different level of spell slots especially for six different kinds of metamagic! 

Pathfinder is firstly a character creation system, and you understand that immediately the first time you level up two characters at once. The amount of character options you get is apocalyptically huge. Character classes are each one a pure constellation of glittering options. Trying to level up two characters so that they might complement each other is a galactic whirling of possibility-space, and then you get close and, oof, that smell reminds you that you are in Effluvium, the trash galaxy. (YES, you SMELL a GALAXY in that metaphor. I am GOING WITH IT.) So, so many choices in character creation are picking through a huge pool of boring stuff to find what's cool, and then second-guessing that choice because the boring stuff is probably stronger, but hold on some of these choices are weak now but gateways to stronger options, but which ones are which isn't telelgraphed, ITS JUST LISTS, ITS JUST LISTS, its JUST LISTS AND LISTS AND LISTS of fantasy bullshit that - at best - will give you a new particle effect to throw at a bad guy and - much more likely and certainly the optimal option - will just make numbers different. Sometimes.

The game doesn't have much high-quality content, but instead it's a big blast of medium-grade crunch. I'm sure it has one or two moments I really could have enjoyed a lot. But I'm done with it. All the possible quests, all the possible character options are fun to think about and wonder what could be, but the actual act of playing it doesn't deliver as much on that wonder as I want it to. It gets lost in random battles that are trivial or impossible; it's dulled by many different writing voices in the text, most all of them trying to be punchy in a very mediocre way. The wonder gets lost, but hey, its still the same fantasy you've always had. If you wanted better, you'd play Pillars of Eternity.

The game provides no transparency into how any of it's mechanics work. Good luck trying to learn all of the different acronyms that describe how you have a +/-5% chance of doing anything based on a stat hidden away within the character panel. Every stat, ability, and spell has a tooltip that is 3+ paragraphs of poorly written text. You'd have to be an accountant to enjoy this clusterfuck of badly organized stats.

The reviews seemed to point to a clunky interface, a high learning curve and difficult combat - things I found to be true but not game-breaking or really (imo) all that objectionable.

If I had known how bad the character writing is, I might not have purchased this game -- perhaps I missed those reviews that emphasized this.

I'm 12 hours in and I've stopped due to poorly-written character dialogue which consists of oddly-paced massive info dumps written for -- well, if I had to guess I think it might be written for people who like to skip dialogue. So far the lore (books, etc.) is relatively well-written, so it seems that character writing is the problem -- which unfortunately includes your journal since it is ostensibly written by one of the companions.

The character dialogue is inconsistent within the individual characters and yet manages to keep an overarching tone of strenuous superficiality across all characters, be they companions, quest-givers or merchants. The effect is something like kids playing paper dolls, ""this is the paladin doll who should sound like this, this is the grumpy dwarf doll who should sound like this, this is the heart-of-gold innkeeper's wife who should sound like this.""

Recently I've been playing Graveyard Keeper, a small but immensely charming resource management game. One of its best features is its characters -- they are informative, funny, surprising, and often quirky or campy. But most important they feel like characters, they are distinct and whole. And this is done with nothing more than basic dialogue options, scrolling text and sound effects.

I'm not expecting the same kind of character development you might find in books and film, just a minimum real sense of consistent and individual character. I also know this is not necessarily easy to do, but there are plenty of people who can do it and allowing -- or not even recognizing -- bad character writing in a CRPG is, for me, a huge problem.",1638897831,1638898505,False,2,0,0.506697893142700195,0,True,False,False

The armor class system make fights highly unpredictable especially in earlier game and higher difficulties, you suck dick constantly and the enemy can easily crit you for three times of your health pool. There is no indicator of your enemy levels or that of the quests, higher difficulties are just artificially jacked up pieces of hot shit that shows a genuinely lack of care from the developers. 

In these build oriented systems, apparently respecting your character is also considered a crime against humanity so you have to set up a custom difficulty for that. 

It is also extremely difficult to learn any of the system if you are not spending hrs to read every single sentences after you acquired a new ability and every texts of every context were laid on top of each other like burning piles of trash. Compare that to pillars of eternity where the chances of hitting your spells against a specific enemy was always shown in clear and calculated texts, this is like having your eyes closed while sticking your dick into a blender. 

And the writing is so fucking bad that I can't stop cringing every few sentences. Characters would just make random comments and have pointless conversations while nobody shows any kind of motives into the game. Whenever they tried to show someone is of a certain characteristic it was always this over-the-top stereotypical acting, I am talking about the struggle of Valerie being too beautiful was so obnoxiously unrealistic that it make Evanka Trump more relatable, or the fact that the voice actor of Amiri was clearly not using her real voice and was manually suppresing her pitch to make it deep utterly killed any sort of complexity this character might have. The story is not any sort of enjoyment to go through but rather a parade to insult the intelligence of the player.

(If you're unfamiliar with Pathfinder, it is a variant of Dungeons and Dragons.)  A large number of frustrations I have often come from either the interface not being great at explaining when something is different, or not explaining anything at all until you're in another menu.  (A game like Pathfinder really demands a character creation/level up screen that lets you preview your whole build from levels 1-20 just to get an idea of what you're doing.)

Similar in some respects to something like Elder Scrolls, however, Kingmaker is massively improved by the mods.  Call of the Wild is a real star here, taking what was largely just the basic 3.5 stuff and adding in nearly all the extra content that Pathfinder had generated over the years, including multiple classes, feats, and spells, with extension mods to add more races, as well. Craft Magic Item is another fantastic mod to break you free of a limited set of base game items.

On the positive side, you get hundreds of hours of content.  It's Pathfinder, so make a party of 6 characters using one of the most in-depth character creation systems in gaming, and throw them at hordes of enemies to see what works and what should go back to the drawing board.  You can spend as much time just playing around with character creation (and enjoying it) as playing the game itself.  The kingdom management creates an interesting layer of competing priorities to put your decisions under pressure.  Kingmaker fights that ""5 minute adventure day"" problem effectively by making time of the essence, keeping your kingdom under constant nuissances when it isn't besieged by crises.  Your desire to make the most of your time conflicts with your desire to always have a full batch of spells to throw, and that creates an interesting tension.  Kingdoms can also be cool sandboxes, although it's a pity that you can't actually explore the towns you build on the kingdom mode - they are just represented by a single ""town square"" map if you want to walk around them.

On the negative side, the game is a sandbox without Oblivion-style rubber-banding, but with a time-sensitive set of places you need to go.  This makes the early game extremely hard, as you are thrown up against level 12 enemies while at level 2... and then at level 8, you're being thrown up against level 6 enemies, and it's a cakewalk... and then at level 20, you're up against hordes of level 30 enemies, and it's a total nightmare.  This lack of proper encounter balance that no sane DM would ever inflict upon their players can lead to bouts of incredible frustration in the early game when you're still learning followed by a vast desert of underwhelming content.

I also am highly disappointed by the romances.  There are very few interactions, leading to a ""let's go to bed"" scene that just flashes black before ""that sure was good sex!""  In spite of being minutes long, they're also wildly unintuitive and based upon extremely particular actions you would have no reason to believe are related to romance or can lock you out of accomplishing them if you don't have neutral alignments for several of them.  This means you have to throw role-playing out the window in this role-playing game and behave unnaturally and by the script to get the romances that only are satisfying for role-playing purposes.  On top of this, the one romantic interest for gay males is in a poly relationship and you get a bad ending if you don't also do it with his girlfriend, so strictly gay male characters are... screwed.

All told, as a D&D veteran, this is something I play largely to scartch the itch that I get when I still want to play more D&D but my session just ended and it'll be another half a week to the next one.

For its flaws, it's still Pathfinder/D&D, and if you want to just make a character and start killing monsters, it definitely has a tremendous quantity of that on tap - especially if you get the procedural dungeon DLC.  That never gets old, and while it's still missing some things, outside of its sequel, Kingmaker has as feature-complete a game of D&D as you can find outside of a virtual tabletop.",1636868191,1638648731,True,13,0,0.598563790321350098,0,True,False,False

Those Portraits crippled imagination and creativity. And some of the ones for this game are overly stylized, and cartoony. The second thing I would have had to mod out was the game put me on a time limit. Fallout 1 and 2 did that, and while I didn't mind it there, the difference is, once you found the water chip/geck, the time limit went away and you were allowed to explore the world at your leisure.

+Finally a faithful Pathfinder RPG video game
+If you liked Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale, you will love this.
+Infinity Engine-like gameplay or Turn-Based like Temple of Elemental Evil
+Amazing selection of classes, feats, archetypes, portraits and races.
+Ton of role-playing choices in dialogues
+Varied companions for Good, Neutral or Evil playthroughs.
+Wonderful and memorable music
+Realistic camping/resting mechanic where you need to use resources
+A lot of exploration to do, a lot of side-quests to find and do.
+Interesting story with various twists and turns, that's also influenced by your choices
+Ability to add your own custom team from scratch if you don't want the story NPC companions.

Cons:
-The Kingdom Management could be more balanced, DCs get out of hand fast and easily ends in a downwards spiral.
-The selection of Prestige Classes could be more expanded (Archetypes make up for it partly)
-Turn-Based Mode can glitch and not advance the next round (toggling it off and on resets it and works again)
-Portraits could have a few more classic choices (no elf druid or male half-orc barbarian or similar. Portrait mods help)

The Kingdom Management mechanic should be set to Automatic or it could end into an unavoidable game over.
Overall an amazing game for fans of the Infinity Engine games.

1 - The developers provide tons of help along the way, but there is no two-ways about it, this is a complex game and you'll need to Google certain things but that's normal, really, for this type of games. However, without spoilers, a curse and a blessing is when you move to a new chapter and need to learn the new mechanics of kingdom management. This tripped me some, but again, Google to the rescue. 

2 - It doesn't matter what level you are, the game keeps good track on encounter difficulty unless you arrive to this area at around level 5-6 where you may not have the spells to deal with the monsters: If you don't have [Protection From Energy] you are done, like I was. However, it was at this point I realized that I finally understood my party abilities and how messed up my leveling was for one of my NPCs (the wizard). So, Google to the rescue one more time: downloaded Respec, a mod for the game, re-set the wizard and leveled her up, with a better understanding of the spells. Some people may say this is cheating, but I see it as a way to fix the only thing the game is missing: The ability to re-spec without a mod. Unless you have played table-top Pathfinder and have intimate knowledge of ALL the spells, abilities and feats, you will mess up a member of your party, however slightly. I am not talking about min-maxing either, I am talking about legit mistakes like giving bow skills to a melee fighter.

In summary, a 9 out of 10 game (one point off for the issues). Pathfinder Kingmaker is an extremely good game with the two issues I outlined, but there is an easy fix for the lack of re-spec'ing (the Respec Mod).  And about the Google-ing to learn silly things, like how the heck I see what regions of the map I control are honestly, normal for games like this.

As a game, it's a mish mash of systems, ideas and a rigidly enforced ruleset that sadly overwhelms that content a little. It is a massively long game with 6 distinct acts that do not flow one after another, but intersperse themselves with a poorly explained Kingdom building mechanic that ultimately just doesn't work and really, really gets in the way of the rest of the game. Making numbers get bigger doesn't really make for a compelling experience, but if you don't do it you'll get yourself in a right mess and the game will end.  It has no respect for your time as a gamer at all, and will test the very limits of your patience.

The character building system is a magnitude more complex than pretty much any other system I've ever encountered and, bluntly, requires PhD levels of study to properly understand and make work. Even at the standard ""difficulty"" failure to understand that will leave you with a character(s) that can't hit anything or do any damage by the end of the game. It's entirely possible to play this game for 80 hours before you realise you've completely got it wrong and are going to have to restart. 

So why do I recommend it? Because that story is good enough to be held up with the best cRPGs - Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin -, and it has a combat system to match. When it works it really does work and it really does deserve to be played.

First, let's start with the good stuff. The art style of the game is solid, the voice acting is good, the story is enthralling and there are many choices you can make that actually have an influence on what happens next or later in the story. You can play whoever you want however you want. no matter if you want to be good, evil or anything inbetween, and the game will almost always give you a choice to be whoever you want in almost all the content. In true CRPG fashion, there are a lot of spells, classes and rules, but even being not familiar with the Pathfinder ruleset, I found the game easy enough to understand (the basics, at least). If you have played a CRPG before, like Pillars of Eternity, you're mostly good to go.

Now we come to the flaws and there are many. I will list everything I can think of in no particular order, though this is by no means an exhaustive list, and hope it won't blow the character limit:

[list]
[*]The performance of the game is terrible. 10-30 fps are the norm and, on my PC, that is completely unacceptable. It seems the game has some issue with rendering lights and smoke effects - those maps chug along terribly slowly. Lowering the graphics doesn't do much as there is no way to turn these effects down or off.
[*]The loading screens are sloooooooow. Every time you enter an area or leave it, there is a loading screen that you will spend up to 30 seconds in - constantly. I would not be surprised if I spent a good 10 % of my playtime in loading screens. The same slowness goes for quick saving - nothing quick about it, as it stops your game for a good 10-15 seconds. The more you play, the worse it gets.
[*]The game constantly sends you from one corner of the world map to the next. Traveling on the world map is slow, boring and you have to stop every 10 feet because your characters have to rest. Also, there are random battles - nice!
[*]Battles are very unbalanced. You can adjust the difficulty, but that doesn't stop the game from throwing encounters at you that are way harder than your previous battles, with no discernable difference. Random enemies can absolutely destroy you, but the boss shortly after can be no problem - or the other way around. Even on the easiest difficulty, some battles can be problematic and unfair. The general battle system works well enough, though, and there is even a turn based mode.
[*]There are tons of explorable areas on the map, but many of them are copy pasted maps, and many are completely pointless with no good loot or interesting things to offer.
[/list]

Next to adventuring all over the place, you also have to constantly manage your kingdom. It's a somewhat interesting gameplay element at first, but gets tedious very quick. You also rarely have time to train your advisors (who do the kingdom events for you), so at some point, you can quickly get overwhelmed and lose the game. Ah, that is another fun thing - timers. Every main quest has a timer. Usually you have plenty of time, but if the timer expires, you go Game Over. Same for letting your kingdom crumble by not keeping up with events or simply being unlucky. If you don't want to manage your kingdom yourself, there is an Auto feature which I turned on later in the game - and, funny enough, it performed worse than I ever did and almost made me go Game Over (which, luckily, is disabled when you go Auto). It's a stressful ""feature"".

The last straw for me were the final 10-15 hours. Tons of unbalanced battles and frustrating map layouts are incredibly hostile to the player. And to top it all off (light spoiler): [spoiler]Depending on your decisions in the game, you are going to lose some group members in the final dungeon. Which decisions and what the requirements for that are? No idea and it is never, ever communicated to you. Have fun losing your best party members for no reason, making the last few hours even more borderline impossible to get through! Oh, and also, you liked this character and got attached to them? Well, f*** you - they're gone if you're unlucky.[/spoiler]

All in all, the heart is there, but the execution is just flawed. I had fun in the first few dozen hours, but the more I played, the more flawed the game became and the cracks started to show. The final hours of the game were some of the most painful I ever had to sit through, which is a shame. If you want to play a good CRPG, Pillars Of Eternity or many of its brethren are vastly superior, but I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Pathfinder: Kingmaker, unless you can get the game on a huge sale and are a massive CRPG fan willing to overlook some of the flaws. I will personally avoid the sequel for now.",1638238765,1638473954,False,2,0,0.516337990760803223,0,True,False,False

The good:

The story, role play, and character development alone warrants your attention. In this game your decisions matter and the story evolves from a small scale campaign to worthy fantasy epic scale. There is no red button green button at the end. The writing doesn't make you cringe and the world is full of rich relevant lore.

The Pathfinder character development and combat is a exciting and rewarding. You will grow from a weakling to a Titan. If you stay a weakling you can adjust the difficulty of every aspect of the game to a level you like.

The bad (The criticisms others have written are valid):

- The combat is punishing and has brutal mechanics like ability and level damage / drain.
-- You have all the tools to mitigate, fix, respec, and generally ""git gud"".
-- Read the combat log, ability details, and in game encyclopedia.

- There are are some combat bugs.
-- Just switch between turn based and real time to fix stuck characters.
-- I had no game crashes or anything that forced me to reload.

- The kingdom management system is punishing and can be frustrating
-- You can just disable it if it annoys you

- The travel and resting system doesn't quite feel right
-- It doesn't make the game harder or add value

- This is not a perfect implementation of Pathfinder mechanics
-- Alignment is not really enforced. Lawful good paladin? Chaotic evil decisions are cool.

- The last portion of the game is brutal and can feel tedious.

Pros:
* Very close to the source material—if you know Pathfinder 1e, you will feel right at home.
* Relatively large variety of options for your primary player character.
* Relatively straight forward controls.
* Stable during run-time.
* Short load times.

Cons:
* Small and repetitive musical score.
* Fraught with erratic rag-dolling and wall/floor clipping.
* Fails to shut down properly every time.
* Steep learning curve for UI and zero tutorial. (Had to google how to leave the first outpost, learn recipes, change prepared spells, and many more.)
* Repetitive game play.

Subjective Cons:
* Terrible pacing/narrative tempo.
* Severe balancing issues. (I'm a beardy, min-maxing role-playing veteran with decades of experience and I had to turn the difficulty down.)
* Horrible narrative clues. Had to look up what to do multiple times.

I'm not an OG role-player from the seventies, but I'm a life-long player and GM and this is just BAD. Yes, there are a lot of bad habits modern RPGs and MMOs have gotten the community into that this game counters, but that's no excuse for an NPC or quest to say, ""go here"" and have it be many CRs above your APL. That's just poor game design. And the shimmering black portal that is actually an Orb of the Void is an old trope, but they're not used anymore. This game is absolutely unforgiving to the point of it not being fun.

I'm not a big RPG player and know next to nothing about D&D type games but having bought the Divinity: Original Sin games on a whim earlier this year (and loving both of them), this title came up on Steam as recommended. I'm really more of a story driven type gamer and enjoy the whole moral choices and outcome thing these games have. I don't obsess over (or even understand) most of the classes and could not tell you the difference between a  wizard and a mage and the in depth lore these games have can be really overwhelming. 
.

Let me start by saying that Pathfinder is a completely different beast to the Divinity games. It is completely unforgiving, expects you to have some understanding of the D+D rule set and it will turn you into a red smear if you make the smallest mistake. There are things that are completely unclear, the maps can be confusing, not well labled and you can find yourself wandering around aimlessly when you're on time sensitive quests.

In short, it does not hold your hand (even when it is). It's hard even on it's easiest setting, it feels rough and unpolished in some aspects (especially when compared to Divinity) and even a little repetitive. Short music loops and only partially voice acted characters  can throw you at times and sometimes you take damage for no discernible reason or you cant clear a negative effect just by resting. In short, there are parts that are frustrating to a newbie.


And yet, through it all theres something in the core of this game that shines through.  You keep going because you're having fun doing it. Having the game be part D&D dungeon crawler and part city management was a stroke of genius. It makes sense for me to rush out and do a silly little spider killing side quest just as much as doing a main quest if it threatens my kingdom and the people there in rather than the whole ""I'll get to it when i get to it aspect other games have. The timer aspect actually makes the game more compelling. And city management itself...well, picking the right companions makes sense here as well. 

The game has a lot to offer and I can see why it now has a sequel (looking forward to playing it when I'm done with this) so I recommend it. As frustrating as it can be, It's got charm, has a big soul and stands out. 

thumbs up from me.

I got to the final chapter and the game fell apart tremendously for me. Absolutely terrible dungeon design, ridiculous difficulty spike, permanent death for companions without clear indication as to why and unskippable cutscenes while trying to trial-and-error your way through a maze killed any enjoyment I had about the game. If you can deal with an absolute shitshow of a final act then the rest of the review remains and it's a great game. But for me personally it was too much, which is a shame. ///

Huge and role-playing-heavy game with a well fleshed out world, let down by the occasional questionable design choice.

Having played other cRPGs based on DnD and other similar rulesets (Baldur's Gate, NWN, Pillars of Eternity, etc.) I figured Pathfinder would be very similar. Compared to those, however, the game (or maybe just the ruleset) felt a lot more punishing. 
Whereas I'm used to buffs and magical items making encounters easier, they feel mandatory in Pathfinder. Enemies can completely lock down and destroy your party if you do not have a Cleric with the one or two counterspells and protection buffs. This often feels unnecessarily punishing and unrewarding to fight against.

Whereas I'm used to feats improving a character and making it stronger, Pathfinder more often than not uses what fans call a ""feat tax"", meaning you need feats to get rid of penalties rather than using feats to increase bonuses. While the end result may be the same, it feels more unrewarding to wait a couple of levels until you don't outright suck at what your build is supposed to do.

Balancing is far from well rounded, in my opinion. You bounce between rooms full of enemies that explode as soon as your frontline reaches them to the next room that shreds your high AC tank in two rounds and decimates your party. Generally the combat is a bit too reliant on a handful of crucial rolls. 
Try to disable the enemy backline with a spell like Grease and succeed and you steamroll over the entire group. If they manage their saves,  they quickly disassemble your group instead. While I would like this kind of approach in a skill-based game I do not much enjoy it when the outcome is determined by a computer. I am playing on altered normal difficulty (which somehow gives enemies 20% less damage and -2 AC, which I corrected to 100% and no AC penalty) with reduced crit damage from enemies and still I have not savescummed this much in ages. Battles are very often decided in the first two rounds.
Enemy bosses that should have a weakness to allow you to combat them (i.e. weak will saving throws for bulky fighters) more often than not receive unstrippable buffs that protect them and remove their only weakness, meaning you want to buff up, gang up on them and hope you burst them down before they can obliterate your party.
As the loading screens remind you, you can adjust difficulty at any time, even in the middle of combat, to reduce enemy damage by 80% if you so desire. This alone makes me think that the devs knew balancing wasnt their strongest point.
In conclusion, Pathfinder seems a *lot* more micro-heavy than the other cRPGs I've played. That is not a bad thing, but not too much to my liking.

Kingdom management, while interesting, suffers from some weird decisions as well. More often than not, the main quest will force you to complete quests with a fixed deadline, or it's game over. Which is okay, because the time frame is usually fairly generous to allow adventuring and some kingdom management. However, upgrading your stats for some reason requires you to sit around unable to do anything for 2 ingame weeks everytime. Why the ruler of the land needs to concern themselves personally for 2 weeks resolving some advisors issue is beyond me. I can only assume this is to try to balance kingdom growth vs. main quest progression to prevent you growing too strong too quickly. Which is moot anyway since you can just lower the kingdom difficulty and then it's all a breeze.

Despite all this it's a huge and satisfying RPG that I have and will sink more time into. Decisions have impact, there is a lot to discover and many locations and quests with interesting bits. Writing is overall quite solid, with a few weak points here and there.

Your party: ""Miss""

It's very slow slogs of combat that just make you scratch your head in utter amazement that your party can somehow have a ""Monstrous Greatsword"" but miss a bear the size of a house.  You will lose based on RNG and you will win based on RNG. So if this sounds like the thing for you, aka gambling, then you'll probably like this game.

(Very minor spoilers)

I was playing in normal difficulty, ignoring the random difficulty spikes on some encounters that wipe your whole team, the RPG aspect of the game is great. However, I felt rushed by all the quest timers, and for most of my playthrough I was unaware of the hidden timers, until they appeared and I felt rushed even more. A game is supposed to be fun, not stressful. Your 1st blind playthrough will be pretty unfun, especially if you're not familiar with Pathfinder rules, but in my opinion there should be more help for beginners, without having to look up a guide online and getting half of the game spoiled. 

The Kingdom Management part was also pretty easy until the Pitax chapter, suddenly my advisors were failing all the events (even my high level ones, had like 10% chance of success), all my stats started dropping heavily, some reaching 0, and then my kingdom just got destroyed, 80 hours down the drain.. So I turned on invincible and effortless Kingdom, and I recommend you do so too unless you are using a guide, but if you go in blind like me, you WILL fail on the Pitax chapter.",1637664480,1637664480,False,5,1,0.525931894779205322,0,True,False,False

After 200 Hours, i've finally finished my 1st run of Pathfinder Kingmaker in challenge mode. Here is what i think about it :

For the people who just want a quick opinion on this game :  i'd give at this game a 9/10-9,5/10, i simply loved the story and it's narration. You really feel you're in a living world who existed before you and will exist after you. You really feel that your actions have consequences too, so it's really pleasant. Furthermore you really have plenty of spells, class, builds, etc  
It's a really good RPG imo : A long and epic story, amazing characters, laughs, tears, and much more! 

So why a 9/10-9,5/10 and not a 10/10? Well because of few points that can spoil a bit your experience  :
1 -  Complexity : If you don't like to read descriptions and then play, you won't like this game. Indeed, it's a ""real"" RPG so each stats is usefull for many things and each choices is important. Here is an exemple : Dexterity is one of the main stat in the game, it's usefull for the Ranged Attacks but not only, it's useful for rogue or other classes according to few requirements. Dexterity affects also the AC ( armor class ), etc. So if you don't read carefully and prepare your build you'll have probably a ""trash"" character and difficult times. I played in challenge mode ( The difficulty above hard if i remember well )  and i had few hard moments because i didn't read enough the spells and didn't understand their interactions, 
Imo, it's only my bad, but it's quite rare to find a game with so much interactions between the stats, spells, etc... So be warned, if you don't like read descriptions then you should put your pride aside and lower the difficulty. 
( Imo this point is both a good and bad point, a bad point because if you're not warned that you'll have to read carefully each descriptions you'll skip usefull things, a good point because once you've read it you'll find amazing combos and builds for new runs!)
2 - Technical Issues : I'll be quick here, my computer slows during fights in turn based mode. I have a good computed so i don't know if it's the game itself or my computer. Anyway, it's more a warning than a really bad point here. The true bad points is that, sometimes, some part of the game could bug a bit, by example  - SPOILER -  at House of the Edge of Time, Kallike and Kanerah stayed on their bench and don't come with me. But, when i reload, they came. So i don't know if i missed some events because i didn't reload when i should have do it. - SPOILER -
3 - Fights : In my opinion, there is 2 things really horrible in Pathfinder's fights. Firstly, the focus. Whoever your opponents are, they'll often focus your character ( And if you're in challenge mode, if your character fall, the game is over ). When you fight a well organized party, the fact that your opponents focus you i quite logical. But when you face a random water elemental on the road i don't get it. 
Secondly, the fact that you cannot rez Okkbo, it's a bit painful imo. 
4 - Broken Abilities : I'll spoil a bit here so be warned. What i have in mind is, of course, the Wild Hunt, when you face Wild Hunt Scouts or Rangers, if you don't have ""Blind Fight"" or a character than can put on you  ""Freedom of mouvement"" you're as much as dead. I don't have much to say here except it could be unfair for some players because you'll perma face the Wild Hunt in the last chapter but nothing really prepare you for that so that can ""kill"" your run. ( Even if, i admit, you can create a new mercenary in the House of the Edge of Time specially for that. ) 

Except this, i really had a lot of fun playing Pathfinder : Kingmaker and i'll definitely play it again and again!

I won't spend time underlying the positives, because the more you play this game, the more tedious it gets. The kingdom management mechanics are interesting, but do not mix well with the overall gameplay, forcing you to stop whatever you were doing just to return to your capital to talk with an advisor. This adds up to a lot of time lost, simply looking at how your party travels. You can completely disable this, but I'd rather see a fully fleshed out, well integrated mechanic than an optional one.

But the reason I'm giving this a thumbs down is the ending. Mild spoilers ahead. While you play you gather a large cast of supporting characters and party members. You can switch your party composition almost any time (you have to travel back to your capital for this, but that's ok). Apart from some companion quests which require you to have that companion with you, you can take whoever you want in your adventures. Naturally, you develop favorites. I didn't even bother to properly level up an equip some characters because I absolutely hated them and wanted to see as little as possible from them. Well, during the ending, you don't really have a choice who you get with you. The faith of some characters is influenced by your previous actions, but some just die and you can't do nothing about it. This is immensily frustrating if that character was a core part of your build. Sometimes the deaths don't really make sense. At some point, two of my party members face off, and the one I had neglected for the entire duration of the game wins and tells you something along the lines of ""while traveling with you I learned that you shouldn't always forgive people"". Apart from quests which required him I never even bother to talk with this dude because he was annoying. So not only are you forced to dramatically change your party, you may be forced to work with neglected companions. I think that the ending of a CRPG should put your build to test, not force you to completely reconsider 90-100 hours of gameplay. Not only this, but the fights are a lot longer in the last chapter. Not harder, longer. It just takes a lot of extra time to kill some enemies, and everything slows down to a crawl.

This game is the equivalent of having a super toxic relationship. The fun parts are extremely fun and addicting, but the bad parts are REALLY bad. The game is fun, Ill admit that. However, if I weren't such a big fan of tabletop Pathfinder, I wouldn't have played it for this long. 

Lets start with the cons...
First of all, there are a myriad of annoying bugs that really just get to you when they appear at the wrong time. Your character might try to cast a spell and then just won't. Playing on any difficulty above normal will bring you to medically dangerous levels of stress and blood pressure. There are points in the game where instead of blocking areas that are too high level for your party, you will walk into an ambush of high level enemies that will make you load your last save slot quicker than you can imagine. The encounters aren't balanced at all, and some in-game features are almost never used or useful(stealth im looking at you). The new player experience was horrible. Even after years of playing the tabletop game, some crucial details are just left to the players imagination. I'm sorry to anyone whose first ttrpg experience was playing this.  

Ohhhh boy... and then there's kingdom management. I had to put this in its own paragraph because it's important enough. This is literally the reason most people stop playing the game, including me. Not only is it boring as hell, it literally prevents you from progressing the story unless you actually invest time into it. The difficulty for some tasks are literally impossible, and in the latter half of the campaign where this feature is CRUCIAL to making it to the end of the game, your advisers don't have high enough stats to even have a chance at being beneficial. You never realize how under prepared you are for this until you are 50 hours late to do anything about it. Do yourself a favor and change the setting for kingdom management to auto when starting the game, it wont have you raging as hard. This entire feature feels like a chore, why would you ever put this in a game ever?

Now to the good stuff...
This game is very fun when everything else is put to the side. The story is fine enough for you to pursue it however you like. The companions are fun to interact with and had some fun backstories. Loot is as abundant in here as it is in Borderlands, so hope you are good at inventory sorting. Either using regular or turn-based combat is super fun, and managing stats and gear for your party is a rabbit hole I was happy to jump into. Leveling up your party is very rewarding and fun as well. 

Final thoughts:
The game at its base has glaring issues which just can't be fixed with a simple update. Please, just find someone who will run the tabletop version of this campaign, that will be a much better experience.",1637465739,1637465739,False,4,0,0.519556701183319092,0,True,False,False

The game doesn't describe how to do any of these things.  People are talking about ""kingdom management"".  I never got that far.  I don't know where the ""stolen lands"" are or how to get to them.  I don't know and never knew how to lift the fog, I just kept bashing my head against it trying to find a way around it by trying every path I could take and it just kept turning me around again and again.  It had no clear advice, no direction.  The fights were horribly imbalanced, almost as if designed by a child.  I had it on normal difficulty and my team would kill all the opponents before my sorcerer could get a shot off.  I had the least aggressive hero because I couldn't participate in any battle since it takes 6 seconds to prepare a spell and by then my team had killed everyone.  Their fighting style was ""dogpile every opponent one at a time"".  That's not strategy, that's not realistic.  That's stupid.  Only a child would think that appropriate.  Most of the time they would come through it unscathed which is even more ridiculous.  The movement around the map is frustrating and annoying watching my pieces scoot down a dotted line.  I feel so lost as the game just assumes you know all about what you're doing.  I still don't know what ""DC"" means.  It never explains it.  I don't know why sometimes when I scale cliffs or thickets my team comes through sometimes damaged sometimes undamaged.  I still don't know why sometimes I'm able to cook meals and sometimes I fail at cooking meals while resting.  And I don't know how to interpret 1d6, I have no idea what that means.

Apart from the Baldur's Gate saga this is the game that comes closest to the tabletop experience, in my opinion.
Great graphics, great gameplay, a lot of replay value.

(Edit) Having played longer, I still recommend it, but with a few warnings:
- The RNG seems to hate you, perhaps is my bad luck but when in a series of ten rolls I get 5 1s, it's a lot frustrating (specially because I just needed 2s to succeed so it seems a bit suspicious)
- There are relics but (for example) for a single ring you need THIRTEEN PIECES, they are extremely easy to miss and you don't have a way to track which pieces you got so, even if you consult a guide you may be doing a lot of pointless bactracking.

And the worst part:
- The kingdom management: the level of micromanagement you'll need to implement makes this feature absolutely tedious. True, you can run it automatically BUT there are some story quests that can't be activated if you do so.

If you're looking for a hack'n'slash. This game is over the top hack'n'slash.

So what disappointed me?

I'm an avid role player. I role play in *every* game I play. I act as the character would have acted, not based on my own knowledge of what is best for me.
This game has a beautiful character builder, where you get to select between many intricate classes and pictures and voices. You can create your character in your head and think of all the things you want this character to do before you start the game.

Then the game starts.

And you're introduced to your companions. They are colorful, Vibrant even. Like a rainbow nuclear explosion. No matter what plans you had for your character, or how you thought your character would progress in this world, you are now the daycare taker of all these other characters, and later on a whole kingdom.

I like to roleplay a character different from my day to day life. This game does not let me do that. Running a kingdom can only be done with the help of others and keeping them happy is a chore.

Between encounter design, the absence of crucial spells from the tabletop game (Time Stop comes to mind), the punishing difficulty of most enemies even on normal difficulty, and the unforgivable bugginess, this game wants to do everything it can to prevent you from progressing. 

The game seems to be under the impression that copy-pasting the same three enemy types around a dungeon, each with ludicrously high armor and health to drag out fights as long as possible, is good encounter design. In actuality it's tedious. I would say bring the game down to easy mode, but if the encounters don't get you the bugs will.

This game is phenomenal. 
Kingdom management - really ambitious and interesting, creates some great story and challenging decisions. Generally implemented very well. I can see why some people don't like it, but I personally really enjoyed it.

Combat - fantastic, plenty of diversity and challenge, visuals are great, facing is on point. Often needed to really think about what paths I wanted different characters to go down, best synergies, etc. Really deep and well implemented system. It generally felt like a well-earned victory in a lot of the challenges I came up against.

Voice acting - really, really good. Plenty of diversity, felt real and engaging.

Customisation - absolutely nuts, there are so many options and I feel most of them worked well. Loved how character stats translated into a range of really interesting non-combat outcomes.

Story - really good, especially for a game that is so long. I've heard it drops off a bit toward the end, haven't found that yet but I'm only 47 hours in.

Exploration - I loved the amount of exploration available, felt vast and exciting; plenty of different challenges and side quests. I also liked how some areas are just not possible in the beginning because the enemies are too challenging. I like that the game basically said, 'yes, you can do whatever you want - do this though, and you will die. A LOT.' The possibility of challenges that you had to avoid made the game feel more realistic and immersive.

CONS:

Balance - at times, the balance can be a little rough. That said, you can adjust difficulty as you go so it's not the end of the world if you need to change that slider a bit. 

Explanations - unfortunately, a lot of the systems (e.g. magic, empire management, etc.) could have been explained a lot better than they were. This is a shame because there is so much depth and consideration behind the development of this game, just falls a bit short when (as a new player) you don't what the heck you're doing.

THE BAD:

The game suffers from the problems of first time developers, but upon putting many more hours into the game and pushing through, it is actually really good. The problems I outlined previously still exist, such as frustrating UI elements, gameplay can feel at times like the game is out to get you, and above all else it suffers from the lack of an understanding DM who will get around the more bs  parts of gameplay to provide a fun experience. The computer doesn't exactly care if you're having fun. And apparently neither does the community, they are quite agressive, elitist and I have seen a few egos the size of this game. Avoid the community, there are some great people but a minority ruin it for everyone!

Finally, at times the combat is a bit tedious because the sheer number of enemies in this game. If it was reduced by about 33% it would be perfect!

THE GOOD:

What an adventure. The story is compelling (albeit with the odd poorly written character, which is explained in my next point) and quite fresh with many different outcomes and characters that, for the most part, feel multi-dimensional. Some characters you'll hate that others love, and the reverse is true. But above all they interact with each other in a compelling way.

The sheer amount of content in this game is extremely impressive for first time developers. And you can really see all the love that went into crafting every inch of this game, even if it is rough around the edges at times. This is the reason the occasional character or NPC is poorly written, there are just so many. 

The kingdom management is fun and refreshing for the genre. I, like I am sure many others, were very excited for Fable 3, only to find out the kingdom management amount to pick a card. It has some flaws, but the positional mini-game you play while setting up buildings is fun, as are the little missions. I do think you need the mod that shows how many days you have left to complete something, as certain quests are time sensitive but it doesn't tell you, whereas for others it does. 

Finally the combat is great if you love to min-max, and I have a soft spot for developers who like to give their players multiple options, and including turn based combat is a big plus. It can be daunting to first see the character creator but once you get into it, you discover a true plethora of options and builds.

Also at the current price, even more with a seasonal discount, its a steal.

I have only one complain, and its a big one: they made NO QUALITY OF LIFE improvements to the rules. 
The developers, chasing to faithfully implement the PnP rules forgot that some mechanics just do not translate well to a video game :
- One time attempts to detect hidden doors or open chests, leveling up takes forever, theres is no way i will remember to come back to an area 5 hours ago to open a chest to get 50 coins and some obsolete magic item. Just let me retry after buffing up or give me some expendable 
 master key items
- Permanent ability and level damage, Coupled with the next point its madness, dont make me sleep 10 times to get my ability scores back or walk all the way through to map to get someone that can restore levels. Just let me restore back to health after sleeping in a safe place or give me easy access to a healer, maybe have npcs follow the party around like many other games have done.
- Components required to use restoration and resurrection spells, seriously, why would this be fun ?, its a rule that has no place in a game that throws lvl 25 enemies at a lvl 3 party without blushing. You walk around a forest and lvl 20 level drainers just come out of the bushes, come on, don't gate healing.
- Resting limitations, this is a hard one to fix i know but it is always a problem with dnd, video games are always very combat heavy and long fights with no opportunity to rest make some classes become somewhat or completely useless after a couple of fights
-Creating (or worse, recreating) a character is kind of a chore, too many options, you cannot easily see what some perks open up in the future, respecs are unnecesarily gated with a gold cost and there is no way to plan a build in game.

It's just way too difficult, even on the lower difficulty levels. Combat is brutal and punishing, even after patching to resolve the worst offenders, and the kingdom management system is just baffling. If you need to browse the internet for advice on how to not fail at kingdom management, then it isn't very well designed or intuitive.
Could be because I'm an old man of course...

There are also plenty of very annoying bits to this game, including the endless gulping drinking noises that occur every time you stop for a second, and the web/tangle traps that leave your entire party stuck for literally 10 mins of real time, outside of combat! (I am writing this review now whilst waiting for the latest trap to end so I can get on with the bloody game!)

Sure, if you are a Pathfinder tabletop fan, and enjoy trying to figure out an incomprehensible strategy system, then go for it. I can't recommend it to anyone else though. I went from playing DOS2 to playing this and there is a huge difference in my level of enjoyment.

Edit: I just blundered my party into another web trap outside of combat so I'm back here expanding my review whilst waiting for it to expire.
I guess I should add some positives though:
 - Faithful to the tabletop game
 - Great story
 - Good level of immersion, with decent music and themes
 - Character interaction is interesting when it occurs
 - Combat system is fairly good, even if it does get ridiculously hard at times

None of the above sufficiently counters the fact that I have lost this game twice due to me not understanding how to run a kingdom.

But Pathfinder, Kingmaker? My god, what an unfun game. The mechanics are terrible. The difficulty balancing is the worst I have ever seen. I seriously hope they learned from their mistakes for the sequel because I was really looking forward to this game.

You can't just pick any old class and play on the higher difficulty levels. It would require nerdly metagaming of an unheard of level OR straight up build stealing, which is the lamest thing a human being can do.  I am sure it would require specific classes and builds and even then, you're at risk of getting one shot - GAME OVER - IN THE TUTORIAL (at the highest difficulty rating)! And if you're on their ironman mode - that's it, forget about it. There is no coming back, it deletes the save file as soon as the final blow comes... and it WILL come, unless you already have extensive knowledge about EVERY single encounter in the game and are metagaming (even then, there would be a ton of luck involved).

This is coming from a person who plays EVERY game on the highest difficulty, with permadeath, if available, and ironman mode - always.

The story and writing are average in their absolute BEST moments.

Playing this is torturous. I wouldn't wish this on an enemy. Worst mechanics in any CRPG I have ever seen.

I'll finish the game but only because I am a masochist... but even as a masochist - just no on this one, y'all.

P.S. Not everything about this game is bad. There are a few redeeming qualities here and there - they are just hard to find under all of the muck. Clearly a lot of work went into this game, I just wish it was more polished.

If this game came out in 1998, it would be a LOT better but would still suffer from thoughtless balancing and poor mechanics.

Edit: Well, the game went from nightmarish shitshow with bad mechanics to too easy really quickly on ""Challenging"" difficulty. Once my party was about halfway through the troll lair, things just got super easy and have been for 40 hours after that.

I tried rolling the hardest difficulty again and managed to eke my way through the prologue... but the first ambush outside of the mansion on the way to Oleg's is literally impossible. I would need to metagame a specific class and choose answers not based on how I want to roleplay that character - but how I want to metagame the companions that accompany me out of the mansion - which sucks.

Admittedly, I do enjoy the kingdom aspects of the game and the writing isn't all terribly mediocre. I just wish they balanced it a little better. I still can't recommend this game, even though the nightmare is getting further away in my memory.

I genuinely enjoyed reading about how my decisions impacted the world.  That said, I will say that the game's conclusion felt a bit lackluster compared to the rest of the game.  It felt almost incomplete, and maybe that can be attributed to the fact that I didn't get the 'true ending' (which if I must say, is something I believe is impossible for any player to achieve without relying on some sort of guide).  The fact that you likely won't be able to reach the level cap is also a bit disappointing, and I wish someone would have told me of the fact before I began.  It would have completely changed the way I went about playing the game, especially in the later arcs.  Not to mention, it also lacks a bit of late-game content.  With not much to do in the later arcs except for kingdom management.
Now that I've gotten most of my complaints out of the way, I will say this:  This was probably the most engaging game I've played.  The characters, the developments, the story, all of it made the game something that I wanted to see through.  I wanted my kingdom to flourish, I got atatched to story characters and actually cried later in the game.  This game made me want a happy ending for everyone, and it was so much fun getting there.  I haven't played many games through to the end, mainly because I tend to lose interest by the time I reach 80%  completion or so.  Do I have the paitence to replay this game and try to get a better ending for myself?  Probably not today, but maybe another time far in the future when I can re-experience the adventures.  Overall, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a wonderful story-driven game and I can't wait to take a break for a month or so and give the next installation a try.

But let's do this properly and start with technicalities:
Is the game bug-free? Of course not. No game of such scope is. Is it bug-free enough to be enjoyable? Certainly!
There are some annoying issues with the game, mostly getting ""stuck"" in turn-based combat and the occasional crash. For the getting-stuck issue there's a trivial workaround, namely switching to real-time combat and back to turn-based. For the crashes the only thing that helps is to save often. It's not that the game would crash regularly, but when it does it's always a relief to have a relatively recent save.
Also, the crashes are really rare. I had approximately one crash every 100 hours.

A big drawback are the loading times. They are less annyoing while playing dungeons, but in the capital or any other area with many map transitions, they become a real issue over time. I caught myself tabbing out of the game quite often during loading screens, even though doing so pauses the loading process...

What is really impressive, from a technical standpoint is how well the controller support is done. Not only is it surprisingly easy to navigate the menus of this rather complex game with a gamepad, it also supports DualShock controllers out of the box, even on Linux!

The game's user interface is rather well done, but has a few shortcomings when it comes to clearly explain how certain stats are interdependent. If one doesn't know the Pathfinder rules already, one has to check d20pfsrd.com sometimes during character creation or level-up. All in all I'd still say it's one of the better user interfaces out there, and most things are clear or at least explained via tooltips.

Combat UI and UX are also pretty good. Not as good as in Temple of Elemental Evil (which I still see as gold-standard when it comes to turn-based D20 combat), but pretty close to it.
If anything is left unclear, the combat log will list all involved dice rolls, so one can read up what happened - with one notable, annoying exception: Game Over. If you are game over, the log disappears. I think one could scroll up after reloading though...

The inventory system is also rather convenient, with options to sort, and a quite player-friendly encumberance system. Some things are only explained in tooltips (like the effects of party- or character-encumberance), but once one knows to basically hover over every UI element at least once, things become clear. What I consider a bit strange though is that one can only cast scrolls or use potions from the character's belt, but nothing is stopping one from moving items there during combat...

Also, if you are used to semi-gritty or gritty loot from game masters from Pen&Paper, this game might be quite an interesting change: Your inventory will be overflowing with extremely powerful items... 

But back to technical things:
This game also has a meta-layer, where you manage your barony/kingdom. This is surprisingly fun, though it can be a little frustrating if you miss to rank up stats soon enough. To elaborate a bit, the kingdom management is a series of ability checks with boni based on kingdom stat ranks and kingdom stability. If you don't rank up, the boni on the ability checks will be low, and you will loose kingdom stat points, preventing you from ranking up, causing you to loose more points, ultimately leading to game-over....
There's also a negative point here, and that is that you might miss some advisors by not visiting certain (optional!) map locations, and by doing so you might get a game-over from kindom management just by having skipped one or the other optional map location... To be blatantly honest, I looked up where to find a Treasurer on the wiki...

The game's main quest is laid out in chapters, with a timer attached. This is good imho, because you always know how much time you can spend developing your kingdom or doing side-quests, before the next catastrophe happens (with one exception, but otherwise it would get boring...).

Now, to the actual game story and how it is presented:
The story itself is thrilling enough. It's no Lord of the Rings, but it's also far from boring, especially if one does all the side quests.
The companions are all interesting, though some are less likeable than others. It's fun to do all their little side-quests to unravel their stories. You can also start a romance with some of them, and while all video game romances have a cheesy feel, this game manages to keep it at an acceptable level...

The difficulty curve of the game is okay (I've played on ""challenging""), though you might start feeling a bit overpowered over time.

Encounters tend to be challenging, but remain fun. Sometimes one has to reload, but that's the price of challenging encounters...

All in all, the main progression is captivating and fun.

Until the second-last and the final chapter. That is where the game looses appeal, and what nearly made me write a negative review. The second-last chapter is a grind-fest where you fight the same types of enemies over, and over, and over, and over again, just to have to fight them over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again in the second version of the very same map...
As this chapter nearly only consists of repetitive battles against the same enemies, the story does not progress much, so the game becomes a bit boring...
The final chapter starts out much better, with varied enemies, but in exchange the game has a very frustrating mechanic in place (which would be a spoiler to disclose) that makes fights take a very long time without them being challenging, so it is bordering on boredom despite the enemies being varied. Once you are in the final part of the final chapter, it's all ""second-last chapter"" again, with many battles against groups of enemies that have the same composition (even the same as in the second-last chapter....), what feels like an artificial way to get some more hours of play time out of the game without adding much for the player...

I'd still say it's worth playing through those final two chapters, but that's more in order to get the closure of having finished the story than the encounters being much fun...

Still, the last two chapters are pretty OK. They are just a bit disappointing after how well the chapters before them were made...

All in all, I can (nearly) fully recommend this game to everyone who enjoys role playing games, both in digital and in pen&paper form. It's a really well done implementation of the pathfinder rule set, with much of its complexity. Technically the implementation is very well done, and tactical battles and an interesting story make the game stand out from competitors in the role playing game genre.",1636412693,1636412693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it will please a very specific audience, that being ""pro-gamers"" who thrive on games with high levels of technical complexity.

----

Alright, I get the appeal now. Took me hundreds of hours to figure it out.

Are you the sort of gamer who looks at the *star map* of Path of Exile's passive skill tree and rub your hands in glee? Do you enjoy looking through massive volumes of options to mix and match the *perfect* build for your character? This game, heck, the whole Pathfinder character creation system, was made for ""pro-gamers"" like you. To that end, there are a huge gamut of classes, and 20 levels of experience; all for you to create your own personal vivsectionist/sword saint/monk monstrocity. It's the thrill of the chase of higher and higher numbers in the hopes of breaking the game's balance over your knee.

To further cater to powergaming munchkins, enemies in Kingmaker are heavily overtuned compared to the original pen and paper adventure path. Powergamers need a challenge for the monstrocities they have created, after all. Not exactly very condusive for casual players. 

Worse, the game assumes you know the Pathfinder system in and out. All the class options, all the combat rules, all the monster mechanics, you need to know them all *before* you start playing because this game really doesn't do an adequate job of introducing the game's rules to you as you play. 3rd edition D&D has been around for decades, you should know it all or go home!

Even worse, you have a whole party of characters to manage rather than just your own if you were playing in person. 

Even even worse, you have a Kingdom to manage on top of that!

(Ironically, astute Pathfinder veterans know that the strongest class builds are actually wizard 17+ and cleric 17+. Spell-casting is king, not whatever funky martial build anyone can create. Tactics over brawn, people.)

Even two years after release and a plethora of bug fixes, Pathfidner:Kingmaker is still quite buggy and quests can fail for no fault of your own. But it is faithful to Pathfinder, the pinnacle of RPG powergaming. That alone justifies purchase by a specific niche. Whether you are part of that niche depends on you.

Old review:

It's more than a little odd not to recommend a game which I made a guide for after finishing it. So let's put aside the bugs which are still present and make this simple.

Main Pro:
It's Pathfinder.

Main Con:
It's Pathfinder.

So is it a con or a pro? That depends if you are already a fan of the Pathfinder RPG ruleset. If you are, then yes, get this game. It's buggy as heck, but this and Wrath of the Righteous are the only games available which is faithful to the Pathfinder ruleset. That's the main selling point. So whatever faults the game has, if you like PF, you're getting this game. It's just barely playable so that you will enjoy it. I mean, you're not seriously expecting a GM to run the full PnP version of Kingmaker from level 1 to 20 in person, are you?

If you're not even familiar with Pathfinder, then stay far away. This game does NOT introduce the main concepts of Pathfinder well. This is one of the worst ways to be introduced to D&D's more mechanically crunchy cousin. Not nearly enough guidance is provided. Pathfinder is already extremely unforgiving to new players. This game is even harder for new players, because you're responsible for the whole party instead of just your own character. You have to be familiar with wizard and cleric spells, special status effects, even special monster traits! Not just swing a sword with a fighter. And in this game you're also responsible for running a kingdom! 

The game is designed with the implicit that players are already familiar with all these systems from playing the pen and paper game, and thus know how to exploit it all. Even so-called ""Pathfinder veterans"" may find this game too daunting as they have never taken the time to master every mechanic.

For a better introduction to Pathfinder, I recommend you play some games in Pathfinder Society online with real people first, then move on to actual pen and paper games. Have someone around to show you the ropes and introduce the systems in Pathfinder. This game certainly doesn't!",1597339884,1635835643,True,0,0,0.542780756950378418,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed the turn based combat and delivery of the fighting. The story/plot is enjoyable as well. Now, for the not so great news...

Your advisors (even when trained up) fail missions more often than not. I usually have between a 5 to 50 percent chance to succeed if I am lucky. The annoyance with having to run back to your capital every week or so to deal with another problem ruins the flow of the game.

Pathfinder Kingmaker is very cool, the visuals are good, the classes are varied and interesting, it seems extremely meaty and the kind of game I would love to master. And yet, I have to give it a negative review simply because of how incredibly new player unfriendly it is. When people write reviews saying the game is 'not for everyone' what they really mean is, you will need to go learn a lot about the tabletop game to understand anything. Is this tabletop Parthfinder? No, seems that it is supposedly different in many ways. That is not the crux of the problem however. Tutorials in this game are meaningless, they give you directions on how any basic CRPG works. What they don't explain are literally any of the very complex mechanics of the game. The very critical information you need will require a lot of time sifting through reddit threads and wikis. I have finally given up on the game very early into the story because my whole team had a certain stat that was lower than the rest leading to what seemed to be a permanent loop of failing saving throws and being unable to move due to webbing in a cave. When I looked up what to do the advice was 'reload from a previous save'. At no point was it communicated that this stat would play into these sorts of mechanics. At no point was literally any information on my predicament mentioned. So much is cool about this game, but if you refuse to give any helpful information to your player, and then the number one solution to problems you cannot solve is to save scum, your game needs work. 

TLDR: Very cool CRPG, will punish you repeatedly simply because you have never played this tabletop game.

tl;dr Only play this if you love Pathfinder TTRPG and have absolutely no friends to play it with. 

- Combat lacks the thrill of most turn-based games I've played. It seldom rewards you for making the right choices, setting up party formations, and executing plans. You could do everything exceedingly well and still miss with every single attack made by every party member 5 rounds in a row.

- There are deceptively fewer customization options than the trailers let on.  In each race, you get barely a handful of aesthetic options, and your character portrait art can only be one of a dozen that other NPCs already use. ""Want a wide character? Let me stretch that texture for you.""

- It only has like 1 music track that plays every battle. It drones on far too frequently even with the option that reduces its looping.

- Leveling up feels meaningless, especially early on. I gained next to nothing with every level I earned, while enemies got exponentially more spell slots and gargantuan aoe spells.

- You run out of juice very quickly, and the conditions under which you can rest to get your powers back are punishingly pedantic. Your best caster can sling their best spell twice. Want them to do it two more times? Walk all the way out of the dungeon, set up camp, listen to your party members banter, pray you don't get ambushed by a $#@&ing demigod that wipes half your party in one surprise turn while you're asleep even though you put your most perceptive party members on guard, and then walk all the way back into the dungeon and try to remember where that minuscule branching pathway you last went through was.

- As far as I can tell, this is an isometric game in which you can't turn the camera around to get a better view. Because *&#@ you. Even the PlayStation 2 Neverwinter game allows you to do this basic function.

- Overwhelming. I've played tabletop RPGs and video game versions of them for years, and the interface in Pathfinder: Kingmaker almost feels like a commercial airliner's dashboard by comparison. This is especially the case for the level-up screens. I would have probably felt even more confused had I not been already familiar with PF rules and progression systems. 

I have more negatives to highlight, but I don't want to write an even longer essay, so I'll focus on the positives now and wrap this up:

+ Critical hits are satisfying.
+ Voice acting is great and immersive.
+ Environments are nice to look at.
+ Plenty of classes to choose from, all fairly flexible for multi-classing. 
+ Varied party NPCs. 

All in all, there really is no reason to play Pathfinder: Kingmaker when the tabletop version exists, and with so many TTRPG-like video games out there that are superior in every way, like Divinity, Neverwinter Nights, and Pillar of Eternity.

At first you'll enjoy it, and by the time you recognize it for what it is it will already have you in its web(and this game loves spider) that you will plow through all the crappy combat, design, fetch quests, back and forth and want to finish it, the strong make it 8%(finish rate) but most, despite how much they want, never make it, they want to, but can't get over the issues mentioned below. 

The first chapter and prologue are fun and promising storywise, but after that, the unbalanced and awful game mechanics and system begin to dominate with boring encouters full of trashmobs, ridiculous and overpowered bosses, with additional help from do no good fetchquests from your kingdom artists, (which you have to do for decent items) companions(which you have to do if you want to keep them alive) the only interesting story left is the main quest, but unlike the first chapter, (and maybe the second) all the other chapters are littered with boring fights with trash mobs like icewind dale. 

So its starts like Baldurs gate, and ends up like icewind dale,but with the worst meaningless, time wasting mechanics ever seen in a video game ever. Overly complicated, arbitrary, unbalanced and time wasting. Did I mention time wasting?

The music is great, but has no variety, and will get boring after chapter 3.

The kingdom management is an unfinished mess, likely a feature creep, and just not fun. 

To summarize, you will want to finish this game after you start it, (unlike divinity original sin) It will look as good or better than Baldurs gate and pilliars at the beginning. But  it isn't because it loses its novelity, outstays its welcome, waste your time at every opportunity and has long, long loading times.

I used to have fun pouring over my books to find fun/strong builds in these systems, but there are several problems with this in a video game format, the first and most present is that I don't actually have the pathfinder books to pour over. The game interface is pretty horrible for figuring out the correct feats/multi-class/stats/skills you need to chain together to create functional characters. I stress the word functional. If you try to build a generic fighter without a robust understanding of the system you will struggle, a generic wizard and your character will be worthless. There are plenty of guides you can follow that will allow you to create very powerful characters, and properly level and advance your companions, but IMO the amount of system knowledge needed to play this game on even the normal difficulty is absurdly high.

The ability to randomly get into very dangerous situations might feel 'realistic' until you acknowledge what it actually creates in practice. Which is either a second layer of system mastery in memorizing the dangerous parts of the game, or constant scum saving (which is literally a tip provided in game...) neither of which are actually indicative of good game design. 

Solo missions are ill-conceived given the weight, encumbrance, and random encounter systems, and creates yet another layer of system mastery (carry invisibility potions).  

Of course all of the above is a matter of taste, if you are looking for a faithful recreation of the pathfinder character creation processes, with a ton of additional system mastery unique to the game, and you enjoy scum saving or memorizing dungeons or reading guides to play a game, then everything above is fine. 

I struggle to believe that anyone actually wants the kingdom management system as it was implemented (even if in the abstract it was the part of the game I was most looking forward to). Selecting events and then waiting for them to finish is, just not a game at all. The throne room events are at least mildly interactive, and even those are not terribly interesting. 

I could continue to complain about the kingdom management system, but it seems odd to spend too much time on it. When the real problem is the overall game direction after you get your barony. The opening quest sequence allows for a lot of exploration, creativity, and options in how you deal with the problems in front of you, but it also gives you a clearly defined goal to work towards. After you establish your barony, all of that vanishes, suddenly you are wasting two weeks on a project, and it doesn't matter, because you don't really have anything else you need to do. The game play loop devolves into, random exploration and time wasting waiting for the next thing the game will force you to deal with, rather than actually striving towards a goal.

The game is very nice, the start of the game is clear, however you will soon find yourself asking a lot the question: what should I do now? Should I go and be an adventurer? Where? Is there a time line that I should respect? What is the timeline, what are the time limits? There was one massive drawback for me with the gulping sounds made by the characters, it was solved by installing a ""mod"" that removed the ""gulp-gulp-gulp"" every 20-30 seconds (a very annoying sound).

While the adventure fights seem ok, you will find out pretty soon that there are fights that can be done, extremely difficult fights but still can be won and completely unwinnable fights until you get to a very high level. The first chapter, defeat the Stag Lord, is relatively obvious, there are not very many conflicting directions. There is a big quick plot quest (find and execute Tartuccio and then become the owner of the land after defeating the Stag Lord) but you can still get it wrong. With other words, the game learning curve is difficult. Well, even after restarting the game 2-3 times, it is still pleasant to try again. But then, the stag lord is defeated and you own a part of the land. A part of the tasks involve your advisors (who must be helped/improved), a part of the tasks involve adventuring and fighting. The game unfortunately lacks clarity. I was always, even after 200+ hours (I never finished the game): ""what should I do?"" 
Because if you do not upgrade your advisers (which upgrades take a lot of time), the kingdom tasks become too difficult for them to accomplish. If you do not go to adventure and fights, you do not get higher levels. If you do not accomplish the big quests in a certain (but undefined) period of time, you will fail massive quests. It was ok for me to restart the game 3-4 times, every time I knew more. But now, after Vordakai, I am failing with the advisers kingdom tasks and even worse, I am failing with Armag quest and I should be reloading the game after the Vordakai defeat (I've started making many different game saves). But what's the point? Why am I doing all this? Why is this plot line so unclear, so muddy, why do I get into a tomb with level 6 companions to find myself fighting with level 18 constructs? What do I do wrong with the quest line for Armag/Twice Born? Where is the coronation, when should I do it? Another bloom is coming, what should I do, another advisor upgrade?

I wanted to compare it with other games, Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate. But those games help you to understand what is difficult and challenge you to do it. Pathfinder: Kingmaker is extremely obtuse, it won't help in any way to understand what it should be done, why, when. And it is a pity. It seems to me to be an unfinished incoherent big project, and it is a shame, because I like the adventure game mechanics. I do not like the innocent fails into unwinnable fights (there is no warning whatsoever that you are going to a fight that can't be won with a level 6-7 team, the fight will be winnable around a level 12 team), I do not like the kingdom interface that takes some time to learn and understand. Maybe I could finish the game if I would dedicate a lot of time to understand, to search, read game walk throughs, but at this moment I have done a lot of research and I'm asking myself: what should I do now? I may not be the best gamer ever, but I do manage to find my own way around. Not with Pathfinder: Kingmaker, this is way above the limits that I accept. Replaying the game several times? With pleasure, BUT not because I fail without understand what is required of me to win the game. Why did I won the fight with Amiri against Armag but the quest was failed?

Now I stopped trying. I read a lot of time but I can't find my own pace for this game. I don't know what should I do, when should I do it and so on. Do I play the game or do I follow the instructions from walkthroughs? I would use a walkthrough for hints, but not for actually playing the game. At this moment it is too much.

If this review seems full of confusion: it is; I am confused. Nice game/fight mechanics, terrible story line (I don't know what I should do and when), difficult kingdom interface (I don't know what I should do and when), extremely clumsy/incoherent fight ranges (in 1 fight I win with ""one hand behind the back"", in another close fight I will not win until I'm about 10 levels higher; some random fights are extremely difficult and may even require a previous reload). A lot of loading times. I've read a lot about the game, I followed some guidance, but at this point it is an exercise in tediousness. 

(If you speak French) I played Dungeon of Naheulbeuk several times - I finished it every time on very high difficulty (in French, as the English language is not on par with the French language in this game). In Pathfinder Kingmaker, after 288 hours of playing, I still do not understand and do not know what must be done.",1635275470,1635275470,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On the one hand, it is the best implementation of the DnD rules on PC with just enormous content. You can literally save a fortune by installing it as it won't leave time for other games for a very, very long period. 
The writing and non-linear storytelling are sometimes so good that I even enjoyed the broadly criticized kingdom building part (except for construction - the latter is not fun).
Combat is decent too. You can switch between real time and turn based modes on the fly, and this feature is implemented almost flawlessly, with no space for exploits.

On the negative side, the UI, tutorials, skill descriptions, and other game elements meant to make rules transparent and playing convenient are lacking and sometimes outright misleading (looking at you, saving throws).
As for the setting and visual style, I suppose the devs were limited by the source here, but it is often out of touch with the tension of the story. In short, that is a very dangerous realm where people are suffering tremendously while you are given options to roleplay an evil char to make their lives even worse.

It has a simple, yet compelling plot with a diverse cast of NPCs, companions and enemies. The graphics are pretty decent and the game ran pretty well. 

It's a pretty long game though. I am usually pretty quick when it comes to game completetion, despite having a completionist streak. My playthrough took just shy of 120 hours, which includes most companion quests and about half the minor side quests. 

My only complaint about the game is the Kingdom management. It is fine for the most part, but if you do it wrong, you will get wrecked later on and the kingdom will fail, which means game over. Some of the mechanics are poorly explained or not at all, and I missed the importance of certain aspects, which meant that I almost couldn't finish the game (without turning off the kingdom failure setting). In fact it began so frustrating for me during the last quarter of the game, that it almost ruined it for me, so my advice is to either turn on the auto kingdom feature and play the game without bothering too much with it, or read up extensively on how to do it right before hand, so you don't get screwed after 80 hours of play.

Some of the companions are really great, some are extremly bland and boring. The same goes for quests, locations and dungeons. The highs are high and the lows are low.
Kingdom mechanics seems like a great base, but can often be rather annoying, tedious and unessecary. There is a lot of place for improvement, and some bad choices the devs made with the design, are simply baffling. For the most part though its rather fun, even though its basically a colorful excel spreadsheet.
The overall main story is rather polarizing. You will either love how decentralized and thanks to that more engaging it is or you will hate the lack of main, clear goal, antagonist or something in this style. 
The game lacks in terms of giving you good choices in some conversations or quests, sometimes a rather obvious solution is missing, sometimes neutral actions are straight up evil or good, but there is so many of them, and most of them is good.
Combat and exploration are the best parts, but too often they are broken up by time limits and kingdom bullshit that does not always work. I would still call this a great gime though.

You mostly watch your characters wail on the enemies, missing or hitting largely by random chance, while those enemies do the same. Without turns there is little tactical maneuvering that can be effectively done. The pathfinder rule set largely requires the action to be turn based and some significant imagination to be compelling. So instead it just forces you to have the right spells prepared to counter powerful attacks or negative effects.

They were good about fixing the majority of the game breaking bugs I encountered when I first opened this game so that I could now actually complete it. The scope of it is really quite impressive however most of the time you are being railroaded as far as the main story is concerned without all that many meaningful choices.

There's a lot of content here and by time spent alone you'll get your money's worth out of it. However, the balance is quite frankly terrible.

Many of the encounters have been changed a ton from the adventure path and the general concept of making encounters harder is to slap templates on creatures to make them stronger than they ever should be able to get. Owlbears with more strength than Adult Red Dragons? Excuse me? Six weretigers with pounce and full levels of Rogue so they go first and get full-round sneak attacks against you before you can react? If I was playing tabletop and my DM threw stuff like this at us I'd get up and walk away, it's just ridiculous. 

Unfortunately the issues also continue into the realm of bugs, most of which I think are based around the game engine. Every couple of hours I have to save and close the game, then reopen it. Otherwise I get issues such as characters moving into the same space as each other, charges being undeclarable even when there's a perfectly straight line to the target, or Kineticists having mini explosions coming from their hands that otherwise prevent them from being commanded to do anything. The turn based mode is great considering it wasn't a core part of the game but sometimes it will lock up on a character's turn and not allow you to select any actions, fixed only by opening the escape menu and closing it again OR toggling turn based mode off then on again. 

It's a shame because I love the tabletop game but this adaptation is honestly terrible in comparison to the likes of Neverwinter Nights. I have to be more critical because they had that to look towards for inspiration only they clearly didn't, making mistakes that could have otherwise been so easily avoided. The main takeaway here is that you have to play optimized characters to stand any chance on all but the easiest difficulty. If your frontline doesn't have 40+ AC at level 12 then you'll just die because of all the bloated hit dice and ability score increases afforded to the enemies. I can't tell you the last time I saw any player with a 40+ AC when playing the actual tabletop game, it's possible but wholly unnecessary. 

Pathfinder Kingmaker isn't the worst game out there and there is still fun to be had with it, hence why I'm recommending it even if only by a hair's breadth.

Without giving spoilers, the main plot of the game has you managing a kingdom through various events and challenges. The UI interface for this is not particularly helpful and challenge difficulty seems to scale far faster than your advisors do. My main issue though, is that each main chapter has a time limit to complete the chapter. This forces you to focus your resources and not to go off exploring 24/7. However, the game's journal system which is supposed to tell you what to do in this time limit is just terrible. It never clearly explains where objectives are located even though your actual character was told or is supposed to know. and certain plot progession is blocked until your kingdom completes projects, which your journal doesn't tell you and these projects can take months. meaning that if you don't do them in time you lose the game completely by failing the chapter. The only way you would know what to do on time is by following a guide.

Me and my friends played, and I do mean this literally, religiously in high school and all through college til now when we stopped due to moving away from each other because of graduating and job offers

Kingdom Management: Bad 1/10 - The most glaring issue in the game right off the bat. It's cool to build a Kingdom and all, but the game does not explain at least half of the kingdom management rules and the ones it does explain, it doesn't do a good job. Not to mention a very sudden and jarring uptick in regards to the DC of the projects about halfway through. But at that point it's far too late to make up for the severe understating. 

9/10 Story(not really counting bugs cuz of next part): Good 9/10 - Story is fun and very cool, as long as it doesn't bug you into the ground. I was lucky that all my bugs were towards the beginning so I could start fresh but many of my friends who played alongside me were not so luck and got a story breaking bug at level 9ish. Aside from that the story is interesting, fun, good twists here and their and easy to follow for the most part.

BUG Management: Horrid 0/10 - They are horrible. Simply horrible. Some are less horrible, like occasionally having class abilities not be functional mid combat. And some are pretty bad, like getting done with a quest and then having to reload a save from days to weeks previously(sometimes in game and sometimes not) in order to get it working again. 

Loyalty to the Lore: Pretty Good 7.5/10 - It good but misses a few things here and their. A lot of Actions fall through the crack due to being what I can only assume being totally overlooked. Some classes are wonky and a few archetypes get in, but not a lot of the cool ones that you and your friends like

There are alot more things I could talk about by I narrowed it to the stuff I think matter most for review.

However, the pacing, itemization and for lack of a better word pointers are sorely lacking. Since there was this whole fuss about kingdoms I really woulda liked to build outposts, see conquered areas colonised by your guards flying your colours. 

The ideas are there though, if you break past that its actually enjoyable, if abit draggy at times. Also, if youre not familiar with the D&D or whatever system this is from its quite challenging to pick up since its very different from some of the more mainstream / conventional RPGs out there.

Well. The good aspects of the game is the story itself. It's quite nice and there is a sense of urgency around all times (explained later..) and the characters are well written. 
The game looks, sounds and feels just fine to play. That's pretty much it. 
And the game mechanics are for the true tabletop RPG friends only. It's a wet dream of minmaxing, roleplaying, mixing different classes and how to absolutely break the system if you want to. It's the highlight in this game by far. Best RPG system I have played..ever.

Well.. that's the good stuff. How about the bad..

The pacing. oh boy. Do a few missions and then go back to capital to do some advisor stuff, do I level them or put them doing problems or upgrading the kingdom or .... while thinking if you wanted to do some quests in the meantime. And when you go out and camp the first time some goddamn flock of monstrous birds is eating all your peasants... oh boy, back to the capital. And you just sit there to fix things until you can go out again. And when you go out you just HAVE to do everything you can. Just to get back to capital and realize the next portal invasion is coming in....170 days.
That just sucks and was the most tedious ...bull**** I have ever seen. It was so boring and just horrible to play that in the end I just gave up. Just gave up. Hope it just makes it. 
And all the endgame combat was just awful. Every monster had an aura that either blinded, stunned, stoned, diseased, cursed, paralyzed or did some other random things to you and even if you buffed your party to the max, the aura ticks were so frequent that some of it got through with a natural roll of 1. Then you were just screwed. I was in the last dungeon three days just to get through the RNG fights. Just awful.

The biggest problem of this wonderful RPG that has the deepest character and class system ever is the game itself. The kingdom aspect does not work or would have needed a TON of rework. I didn't have fun playing this game and that's a huge issue. I felt drained and in my mind was just thoughts of ""Please let this end...just end that I can uninstall this, please? Nope.. another RNG festival with the Fey people. Oh good my front line is blind and my mage is paralyzed..time to reload and try again.""

Is this a tedious game for tedious people? Yes. For sure. Get it if you want to have a micromanagement simulator of tasks and combat to get everything perfect and in the end you missed one dialogue and you get hosed from the best ending. Or miss a diplomacy/bluff check somewhere and get screwed. 

And the worst thing of all that REALLY made me hate this game in all my heart was.. the last book in the last dungeon was missing. it wasn't there. I checked the guides, walkthroughs and all and it was just not there. I actually uninstalled the game and reinstalled to be sure from a earlier save and it was just missing. RIP Linzis Book. And RIP this game. I will not be playing a Evil campaign ever because it is just so brain numbing to play. 

In the end it took me over 110 hours to finish and I hated every minute of it. I think I lost a part of my soul in the process.",1634323884,1634323884,False,1,0,0.511284410953521729,0,True,False,False

- a code-messy spelldescription (still no idea what the spell does)
- a doubly appearing combat message
- glitchy skill/item/spell/etc. information menus
- missing information in the thousands (what does sickening do?), don't believe what the game/people tell you, the tooltip, extended information and encyclopedia information are all the same (more or less)
- spelling errors
- nonsensical errors in information, dialogue, storytelling (text)
- bad game design -- sneaking to scout, forced into scripted encounter with the sneaker being alone and far from the group (no, it wasnt a failed stealthcheck) -- impossible encounters all the time (hello? maybe ease in the new player? and no, 'tailoring' the game difficulty is a bullshit argument, it destroys immersion) -- no combat escapes whatsoever, given the forced scripted encounters, this makes a 0 death run impossible: destroys immersion --I already felt forced into giving my champion the die hard feat + the 'immersive combat' option just takes all helpful elements away without the visuals being good or big enough to recognise combat behaviour which makes the combat/game actually less immersive in consequence

I could go on, but it's just to vent, not to make a comprehensive list. I will keep playing because I bought the game yesterday and maybe it's just my learning curve/I can construct some backstory that makes loading all the time fun.

If with longer game time, this rotten feeling while playing changes, I will change this recommendation of course, if you still see the red thumb. Stay the fuck away.

Edit:
-how am i trading potions from one character to the combined inventory to another character half a map away and am still playing after pathfinder rules?
-why does amiri have defensive fighting on every start of the fight?
-why can't I leave the first encounter area?
-no character outline when hovering my character
-changed difficulty to have some fun spite the bugs, game changed the difficulty back to challenging reason unknown
-dead undead companion kept dieing and pausing my game when i ran away. after i left the area she was with my group again although i had no way of reaching her safely

giving up, this game isn't finished.

two thumbs down if possible

creeping forward (hey i paid 30$ for this piece of shit) after 15 bugreports (discovered the ingame bugreport feature)
im REALLY giving up now. game is sending the player alone to a location where u have no way out without a positive mobility/athletics skillcheck. as a wizard thats almost impossible. this early in the game i dont even know about any ways to improve those abilities artificially. so the game requires you to die and reload until you hit a natural 20. awesome. refund please.

Edit#3: 
About a year ago i played the game until 2/3 i guess before it got too slow and boring. If you adapt and accept the fact that there is less freedom than in BG2, a game created 20 years before this one, it's actually in an enjoyable state now. I'm here because I'm thinking about buying Wrath of the Righteous, but seeing comment over the internet it's the same bullshit again and you should *think* about buying it probably earliest a year after release.

So, i WOULD change to thumbs up now, BUT seeing they did the same bullshit with WotR again, I can't. Fuck those greedy company policies.",1549720288,1634314613,False,5,1,0.531209647655487061,0,True,False,False

But I was trying to solve the Varnhold kingdom disappearance, and apparently I didn't move fast enough. So... POOF! My kingdom was completely wiped out. No battle. Nothing I could do about it. 

NOT. A. DAMN. THING.

There weren't even any warnings, except for a cryptic ""Magical energies are building."" Yeah? What am I supposed to do about it? The game doesn't tell you. So I followed the main quest lines and handled kingdom management. Then all of a sudden, everything was for nothing. 

This is no way to write an RPG.

EDIT: I'm changing my recommendation to ""Yes,"" because after I went back several saves and replayed things, I managed to get past this. More importantly, I'm having fun again. 

But the comments above are still valid. Most players will need several searches through the forums, in order to complete the main quests, because the game gives them next to zero assistance. You're told something incoherent is hurting your kingdom, and you have to blunder around (while the mysterious whatsit eats away at your kingdom stats!!!), until you learn enough to figure out WHAT it is, and how to stop it, then hope you still have enough time before your kingdom is instantaneously destroyed. ""Something is threatening your kingdom"" is NOT sufficient! 

Furthermore, the game uses the Pathfinder names for months and days of the week. If you don't know what they are, you'd better look them up from some external source, because the game expects you to know them without having anything in the help (that I could find, anyway) that lists them. You'll be told ""This must be completed by 1 Erasmus"" or ""Meet him on Oathday"" without being given a reference by which to sort this out.

From the jump the game already shows you what you should keep in mind.
Choices: Every Choice you make matters whether you realize it or not
Team Setup: You can have up to 5 party members (6 if you include yourself) not to include any pets your companions acquire. The way you build your companions can decide whether an encounter will be easy or will destroy you team in a matter of seconds
Interactions: Your character has a range of possible moral and non-moral choices, in which you companions will mention what they think you should do. Regardless of whether you follow it or go against it your companions will comment of you choices.
As for the bad; The game has a few consistency issues when it comes to it classes, as well as most of the companions have wasted abilities. You can also miss possible companions because you visited their area too early or too late and it became impossible to get them.

Does a decent attempt at the RPG aspects mixed against the tabletop rule set style of interactions & combat. 

Great stories, be it main, side, rng or what ever comes your way. 
You actually want to like and hate some characters. Thats an impressive achievement on its own.  

Its long and life eating, decent>hard learning curve. All good points imo. Makes you want to invest in it. 

For the .. ""bad"".. Some of the rng event maps begin to get samey, quickly, very quickly. However its not the end of the world, try and focus on the event not the map its playing out on. 

Some quests will make you resort to google to figure out what to do now. I dont like hand holding in games, but a rare few quests completely lack any form of hints.

Some CTD issues. I suspect its from long play hours rather than mostly game issues. Not many games can go on for several hours without issues. The game autosaves quite often, so you dont lose much progress. 

The games timers are.. annoying in some cases. I wont lie i resorted to using CE to speed up some game actions that took 2 weeks or more in game. As new events happen, you cant stop the project mid project and thus you can lose some side / companion missions with no chance of seeing them start and become a loss through not acting sooner. This is about my only main issue, yeah as a kingdom you cant fix or win everything, but for those who are OCD about achievements and content finishing.. You will get frustrated at these moments.

Utter fucking garbage . . .

Get used to the game with undefeatable enemies. Particularly Swarms and high level monsters in the natural progression of the game.  This is really a fan boy fuck you sort of game.  It loose fun after the drudge and slow crawl to level characters high enough to actually be effective.  Then you have to return to previous maps, to get the quest items that you were not able to do the first go around because it  the developer likes to drop undefeatable monsters at low level characters.

After a while, you just lose the game because you don't have the RIGHT advisor for to unlock a MANDATORY advancement in the game main story line. Essentially you have to put up with the bullshit kingdom drudge, while playing the drudge of leveling up the character.

Then you are told to go make a kingdom and everything goes to shit, mechanically, for, like, no fucking reason at all. The random encounters, ALONE, are fucking MISERABLE. This is one of those times where being too true to the source material kinda screws the game itself.

Pathfinder characters hardly ever make it past level 3. Most characters don't even make it to their first level up a majority of the time simply due to how low level Pathfinder plays. Now, I imagine that after the first 5 levels, as with real Pathfinder, the game really opens up. However, unlike real Pathfinder, I can't just make a new character at that level and keep playing. I also can't skip the shitty first 3 levels where characters don't even work correctly.

Kingmaker's story feels like a beginner DM's attempt at running The Keep on the Borderlands.  Owlcat really wanted to implement every aspect of the Pathfinder system into a game and, well, they did it.  Though they never asked if that was a good idea.  Pathfinder, as a TTRPG system, has many warts.  One of them is touted as a strength; high levels of character customization.  Been a TTRPG DM for 20+ years and I can tell you that giving too much autonomy to PCs often leads to broken builds, min-maxing, and unbalanced combat encounters.  Kingmaker has all three of those.  That, coupled with a tepid story, and you wind up with a game that's more of an extended character generation process than an actual game.

However, I'm really glad I got it. I disagree with other reviews saying that it's complicated, and designed for the player to fail. I actually hate how much hand holding there is. Like I don't need NPC's to tell me to be careful before stepping into a battle lol. As far as complicated, I thought it was pretty straight forward. Even a novice pathfinder, or D&D player would understand the mechanics, and strategic planning that's expected to get through the game. However, if one was not familiar with these games, and expect a hack and slash, or even something like Dragon Age you might be disappointed. While the questing is similar to RPG's, you do not get unlimited casting, or ability use depending on your mana, or stamina. It's a set number of uses a day, rest required to refresh, and you will be resting a lot.

First background: RPG, MMO, D&D gamer, also do tabletop D&D as a DM on and off for 20 years but of course love playing while others DM too. 

Pros: 
Map is really fun
Graphics are decent for a CRPG
Areas are fun to explore
Some NPC's are interesting, as are some companions
Fights are challenging (reloading... lol)

Cons:
I hate hate hate hate hate the way the females are written because even in this fantasy world amidst total destruction we would of course care about our clothes, makeup, and how cheerful we appear to others (we wouldn't lol)... queue manic pixie dream girl trope for the dev who has clearly never actually met a real woman... *groan*

It does feel linear in ways, like I get the encouragement to follow the story but with so many areas to explore I really feel an opportunity was missed to maybe flesh out the game a bit more with some side quests. For instance, [spoiler] when helping the mites and kobolds find peace among their tribes, throw in a few side quests so that the main quest does not become so stagnant. [/spoiler]. 

The loot is just sort of meh, everything decent I have I actually bought from a vendor. In all my years of playing D&D I've never known someone to have a weapon preference of a +1 pick lol, and after a challenging fight it's a huge sigh of disappointment :D.

I like the faithful recreation of the rules, the sheer ambition of the devs, and most of the gameplay, but some serious design flaws can stop you playing and never picking up this game again. You may want to use a walkthrough to play, even the first time.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a super faithful recreation of the Pen and Paper tabletop RPG Pathfinder, with a super large campaign to go with it. When released it suffered from a LOT of bugs but this has gotten better over time, and while quite a few bugs persist, none of them are game breaking and are easy enough to work around or ignore.

If I had to describe this game in one word it would be: Ambitious. It is already a huge task to make a video game faithful to the Pen and Paper game that works both in real time and turn based (which it does), but they also decided to make a campaign that has over 200 hours of gameplay where you found an entire kingdom which comes with its own mechanics, a dozen companions with their own stories and personalities, story decisions that pay off basically every time, thousands of lines of dialogue variations that depend on who you chose as your advisors, terrain that looks different depending on the season, artisans that have their own mechanics for getting the best items in the game, having basically every type of creature pathfinder has to offer, and having all of that work together! Seriously, whenever they could have taken the easy decision they did not and instead seemed to make it deliberately harder for themselves!

However all this ambition had a cost, and it basically means there are sections of the game that are tedious or unplayable if you did not prepare the right way. The game has an idea of how it wants its players to play and if you don't fit that script you could find yourself having to revert to a save several hours ago (for example if you don't have a way to restore attributes, you might be SOL in the middle of a dungeon). If they hadn't thrown all that extra stuff in they may have tweaked the balance better or been able to iron out these gameplay difficulties.

Another word of warning. I am a seasoned 3.5D&D/Pathfinder player, so I found myself right at home in this game. I struggled with the interface at first but figured it out mostly because I knew the underlying system should allow me to do certain things. There are TONS of little rules and many of them you'll never know exist unless you know to look for them. If you have never played 3.5 or Pathfinder, there is a steep learning curve here. And it sucks to discover that you've been doing something wrong for 50+ hours. But it is certainly doable.

Lastly, there are some truly asinine late game decisions in the campaign. The last dungeon, House at the Edge of Time is infamous with how unfun and unfair it is. Not only do they face you with some of the most annoying encounters but they also take away some of your companions. If you built a team of story companions and messed something up in their personal story 100 hours ago (no seriously, it can be that far back) you cannot use them for the final dungeon. If you built a team to play this game with, the final dungeon may just take it away, just like that. 

Overall I am going to recommend Pathfinder:Kingmaker in large part because it is the only faithful 3.5/Pathfinder crpg out there (the old Neverwinter is not turned based so don't get me started on that). Play it with a guide that can warn you about some of the atrocious, hidden design, and you will have fun.

______________

I am updating the review to address the fact that the game, now in 2021 still has no crafting, massive itemization holes, and more cut and paste linear RNG progression than is tolerable. You can, based on a weapon of choice decision, end up at the finale with a +1 trash weapon that you used for the whole game. No one who has ever played PNP pathfinder would consider this kind of trash module writing acceptable. 

Additionally, there is no crafting. They made the artisans an RNG process that gives a ton of useless junk that is in no way based on the character, but instead hard coded to a table. This again is unreal bad module design. It would be so easy in the context of this module to simply make it so you can hire court crafters and help them make special items catered to your character path. This would be childs play both in terms of coding and game mechanic design. WAY to much of this game is just hastily added trash...",1543598630,1633635818,False,0,0,0.475800424814224243,0,True,False,False

Review after finishing the game once on normal difficulty. This is only for base game, I’ll review DLC separately.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Do you like Infinity engine RPGs like Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale? Do you know DnD 3.5 or Pathfinder systems, or are not opposed to learning one of the most known and popular pen & paper RPG systems ever created? Do you like to have an option for Real-Time with Active Pause combat?

Do you hate the direction new popular cRPGs take with how Witcher 3 is an action game, Divinity Original Sin is a tactics game and most original RPG systems like the one in Pillars of Eternity are just weird with stuff like mages requiring strength stat for their spells? Do you hate how Baldur’s Gate 3 is going to be a new Divinity game with turn-based combat only?

If you answered yes to both paragraphs - Kingmaker is for you. In almost every way this is the spiritual successor to Baldur’s Gate 2.

The thing masquerading as Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam is just an impostor. Support Pathfinder instead.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Pathfinder: Kingmaker is an homage to oldchool cRPGs on the infinity engine: Baldur’s Gate, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale. I believe it sits somewhere between Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale in how it feels to play as it focuses a lot on party management, while putting writing and overall story on a secondary plane.

Game employs time-limited quests that will have you making tough decisions not seen in cRPG’s normally. Things like loot slowing down your party’s travel time on the world map, which makes you waste more time than you might like, resting requiring rations or setting aside time to hunt etc.

The game uses Pathfinder rules, which I’m not familiar with, but I have a lot of experience playing DnD 3.5 and Pathfinder shares about 80% of it’s DNA with that system. If you ever played DnD then you’ll feel right at home with most basic stats, armor class, saving throws and even classes and spells being the same.

Combat can be done in real time with active-pause or in full turn-based mode. I hate turn-based combat systems so I played exclusively with active-pause.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Core rules[/b]
By core rules I mean everything that refers to micro-management and character progression, combat and exploration of the maps, where you move your characters, interact with NPCs or objects, fight enemies and grab loot. Everything felt mostly fine.

[b]+ Combat[/b]
If you played Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale then you’ll feel right at home.

[b]+ Presentation[/b]
This is a budget game, but looks nice.

[b]+ Story[/b]
Events are well connected and it’s fun to experience them.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Campaign rules[/b]
Everything on a macro level, that is managing party encumbrance (which is pretty criminally low and has few ways of increase), time management and kingdom management. A lot of rules feel like unnecessary punishment and other times rules are obfuscated or totally obscured from you, so you will just have to take a wild guess as to what result of your action will be. Kingmaker tries to be too hardcore, but the result it that it feels more like trial and error. You can easily screw yourself without even knowing and will have to restart the campaign. On subsequent playthroughts on the other hand – the game will be a cakewalk since you will already know all the choices to be made and consequences of thereof. It’s simply a poor design.

[b]- Endgame dungeons/encounters[/b]
One of the endgame dungeons will have you teleport randomly through multiple areas. The portals used never point out where they will throw you out and also stepping through a portal changes the time of the map. Meaning you not only teleport in space, you also travel between 2 different dimensions. There’s not enough visual indication of which dimension you currently occupy, so you just have to keep track of it yourself.

Then there are encounters in those endgame areas. All of them will require your party to be constantly affected by specific protection/buff spells. The enemies are tough, have large numbers of units and can summon even more units. When you have an odd difficult fight – it’s entertaining. If nearly every fight in the dungeon requires 100% preparation and effort, then it becomes tedious.

That gets even worse in the actual endgame questline where game throws you even more curved balls, which I don’t want to spoil, but I just hope you have been collecting and saving lot of scrolls and other consumables because if you didn’t and have no money – you’re fked.

[b]- Writing[/b]
Before buying the game I’ve noticed a lot of people complaining about an SJW-style writing. Having experienced this in Beamdog’s additions to Baldur’s Gate I was very weary of this game. I feel like some of the criticism is a bit overblown, but there’s no doubt that someone on the writing team is really into modern feminism.

Out of the 5 initial companions 4 are women. That in itself is fine. Among those 4 women we have:
- a quirky bard – mostly fine, but she doesn’t feel like a real person
- a bodybuilder berserker who feels constant urge to show how much she is better than men
- a beautiful knight, who hates that she is beautiful and snaps at you for pointing it out
- an old elf who is a complete psychopath
And the only one male companion is a dwarf cleric who constantly says how pointless everyone’s life is (including his) and would revel in letting everyone die.

When 2 out of your first female companions hate men and the other 2 are quirky to a fault, and the only guy is a useless downer then I can totally see how people view this game as being some SJW propaganda.

However this first impression gets remedied a bit after you meet some new party members, and others get more characterization with their quests. Eventually even the female knight, who’s quest starts as the worst written one, gets a decent closure in her last quest.

There’s one point in the story where the writing is particularly terrible in a jarring way. Spoilers ahead.

In one main quest you are introduced to a concept of how names can be used as weapons and writing immediately turns to reflect that. In every interaction aside from bluntly introducing yourself to an NPC, you also have an option to say something like “you don’t need to know my name”. After that you have NPCs directly luring you into saying your name. I’ve seen through the game’s antics and avoided sharing names every time. What does the game do? At certain point an NPC who never knew your name will say it out loud to everyone and your teammates will happily share their names and their life stories in dialogue that can only be described as blatantly serving this specific purpose because the bad guys need your names for things to happen later.

[b]- Trickery save-scumming[/b]
There is no way to know if an object is locked or not that I know of until you click it and your rogue attempts to open. If you fail – you can’t reattempt until you increase your trickery by leveling up.

This means you will save and reload sometimes multiple times because your +10 trickery thief cannot roll a 5 on a d20 for a 15DC lock 6 times in a row. At least give us a take-10 rule ffs…

[b]- Endgame performance[/b]
During the course of the game my save/load times became longer and longer and it gets annoying because saving after every encounter is nearly necessary in these games.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
A competent game. It’s poor writing and kingdom management aren’t enough to keep a determined player from finishing it and the breadth of systems and options are engaging. This it the best we have when it comes to cRPG at the moment.

The encounter balance is simply not well designed. The stats are bloated and more mobs are added from the original material for no reason. When options like Rogue Barb are considered ""Noob traps"" and the community agree's that there's only a couple of classes that are actually viable on any difficulty higher than normal, which involve serious multiclassing, that's a problem. It's entirely possible to lower the difficulty but that doesn't feel like a proper fix, just allowing the player to experience the story without constant reloads.

Steam makes me choose a yes or no.  If I could rate it, I would give it a 6/10.  A 6/10 to me is hardly a passing score, but not the travesty I see so many people complain about.

The good:

1.  Nostalgia: It felt like I was playing the ol’ pen and paper RPG of old (especially when using turn based combat)
2.  Story: The story wasn’t bad.  I played through about to the startup of the kingdom when I was still playing through pathfinder modules and this reminded me of it.  Had some good plot hooks and twists and I felt like I could understand the characters motives.
3.  Glitz and glamour: The graphics and music were pretty good, not fantastic, but pretty good.

The bad:

1.  Balance Issues: One of the things that plagued pathfinder in general were balance issues, this game is no different.  You would go about steamrolling through enemies only to find a certain enemy that required a specific weapon to kill, or ones that required a natural 20 to even hit because the balance was so far off.  Nothing like having to fight a “bear-like treant” at level 2… (WTF is that?).  Also, you get to a certain point in the game where they just start adding adjectives to creatures to make them more powerful.  They just start adding things like: “enraged, greater, primal, and venomous” to monsters to inflate their stats.  Basically it meant giving them ridiculous stats and permanent spell features like “blur”.
2.  Alignment choices:  So I made the mistake of playing through my run as a paladin.  Nothing inherently wrong with paladin, except for the part that in pathfinder, you are required to be Lawful Stupid.  After playing DnD 5e for a few years, I was so glad they finally removed ridiculous alignment requirements from classes.  What I realized after about 10 hours of my play though, most of the “good” dialog choices were chaotic and my alignment was ever creeping away from lawful good.  Many of the lawful good dialog choices were bizarre and mostly about just executing people.  I was often forced to take less than desirable dialog choices simply because the alternatives made no sense.
3.  Quest time limits:  Sorry but no.  These are just terrible.  Nothing like having to constantly look at your quest journal to see if you’re about to fail a quest.  If you’re into this kind of a thing, then go for it, this made me feel constantly rushed.  An option to remove quest & kingdom timers would have been nice.
4.  Kingdom management: I was excited about the kingdom management system.  This however was just bizarre.  Often times I was save scumming because my advisers would keep failing missions they were way overqualified for… holy “1's” batman.  Also, wayyyyyyyy too many events and problems and far too few advisers.  Heck, you don’t even get enough people to help you manage your kingdom until the game is halfway completed… yikes.  I don’t understand why they thought this was a good idea.  What, I can’t hire some competent people to do the job?  Ridiculous.  After 20 hours of game-play, I turned it off, it was so poorly put together I didn’t want to deal with it anymore.

Conclusion:  IMO this game needs some fine tuning.  If you want to take control your game, do it with mods.  This could have easily been a 9/10 game with just a few changes.

The good: It's a pretty faithful adaptation of PF2 ruleset. I also personally like the art style. 

The bad: It is extremely buggy. I have been soft-locked in combat more times than I can count. Is it easy to fix by disabling turn-based for a second? Sure. But I shouldn't have to. 

It is very poorly balanced. I don't like every fight to be a walk in the park but I don't like being forced to save scum either. This game is literally unplayable without save scumming. If your difficulty settings are a true 1:1 tabletop analog, it is even harder. Normal mode gives you some advantages such as weakened criticals against PCs and slight damage mitigation it still feels pretty lopsided most of the time. 

Despite being a good adaptation of tabletop rules, it fails to explain how some of those mechanics actually function in video game format, resulting in even more need for save scumming. 

What isn't bugged is very poorly designed. I hope you like googling random mechanics over and over as your PCs inexplicably and repeatedly die, or better yet, you find it impossible to make your ranged classes attack with their ranged weapons....yep. 

Did I mention the spider webs that you will get stuck in for 10-30 minutes REAL TIME, in multiple encounters?

Bottom line: The fanboys will inevitably tell you that many of these flaws aren't bugs, and you just need to learn the ruleset.

I love pathfinder and figured a video game rendition based on it could be fun, but this iteration makes no effort to adjust the system for the key difference it has in regards to a regular tabletop session, namely the lack of a human element.

In an actual game the dm can adjust for streaks of bad luck, parties getting stuck or misjudgement in encounter balance on the fly to make sure the game remains fun for everyone. Similarly, even if you do fail repeatedly due to bad luck, failing can still be fun if you can laugh about it with your friends while the dm subtly adjusts to turn that guaranteed tpk due to bad luck into a tense battle for survival the party just narrowly wins due to ingenuity.

This game cannot provide that, bad rolls will destroy you out of nowhere with nothing you can do about it, which just encourages save scumming until you get lucky. Encounters are not balanced for the party, and you can just accidentally wander into fights that will demolish your entire party instantly without even as much as a headsup, or steamrolls that you apparently should have faced earlier. 

On top of that, the deviations it does make from the system all seem to be for the worse. Total defense does not exit, casting in melee doesn't provoke, you can't attack from prone and *have* to get up before taking other actions. Those are just a few things I noted in the first few hours, I can only imagine there are more.

The settlement system need some adjustments, I only found out how to build new buildings mid-game, it is convoluted and the buttons are so small and at the corner. Instead you should have a settlement menu, like: enter, manage, build and so on. As it is now its time consuming and confusing
Also the quantity of settlement quests are absurd and the time required to complete them is too much! More pops up than you can complete, making failure a constant issue and quite frankly it just creates stress. I actually had to pause the game for several weeks because mu settlement was destroyed and it was not clear why, then I found a quest hidden between all the junk quests that was essential for survival. Had to load an old save and adjust the difficulty to easier otherwise it was game over.
I know what you are thinking, ""you can adjust the difficulty at any time"" yes but, I like the challenge and was not motivated to go easier, I just felt it was more of a stressful experience to manage the settlement, instead of a difficult one. For example: with an difficult enemy you can go back later, prepare potions, adjust spells and tactics, that is great and challenging but with the settlement it was not like that, it was just stress, quests pilling up and no one being able to take them, even if you devote the attention to them, more keep pilling up, and they are quite repetitive... 
Second point: you could make the icons for the feats with drawings like it was in neverwinter and not initials, it would me more intuitive and pleasing to look at your sheet.

An amazing game that stays true to letting you make and play as your own character.  But was released way to soon and riddled with bugs with a difficulty spike to boot.  They failed a very simple copy and paste as Pathfinder is a very well established TTRPG and Kingmaker is one of their Adventure paths that have so much work already put into them.

Edit:  It took them almost 2 years to fix the loading times and it is now playable.

I love this game do not get me wrong despite me not recommending the game because I do recommend playing it but just be prepared.  
Good Things:
Character Creation is incredible allowing you to make your own character, customize your companions, and if you don't like your companions you can make your own entire team in the form of mercenaries.
Story is good and the world feels alive as they make sure that each one of your decisions affects the world.
Companions your combat companions are very well written to the point where I hate all but 3 of them.  The non-combat ones are forgettable though

Mixed Things:
Kingdom Management is all right.  It's a very cool idea but could use some work as gaining the material needed to advance your kingdom is very slow to come by.  I honestly suggest instead of buying equipment just buy the material in order to keep up.

Bad Things:
The difficultly makes no sense.  While they do have multiple stages of difficulty as well as a customizable difficulty it spikes randomly and can be darn near impossible to beat even on the lowest settings.
There is no direction for nearly everything.  The story, companions, kingdom management, or building characters.  The only reason I knew what was going on half the time was because I've been playing Pathfinder for a very long time (almost 8ish years now) but even I was lost about 25% of the time.  
The Finale, going to be avoiding actual spoilers, is super hard but super anticlimactic.  The finale boss is super easy compared to the 3 other bosses you had fought prior (yes there are 4 bosses in the finale).  The epilogue for what happens after doesn't make sense as it jumps between your companions, the kingdom, and the world and characters you had forgotten about.  There is also no post-game making some achievements impossible to get (and I'm not even an achievement hunter).
Bugs Galore some missions just stop functioning or don't even activate on time.
Load times are absolutely atrocious, most of the time I have on record 30 odd percent of it was spent on loading screens.

I think I covered just about everything I can think of.  I really do like this game I haven't had this much fun since Dragon Age and the like.

This game has some bugs. It's not perfect by any means. But it IS amazingly in-depth, there's a LOT going on. Kingdoms, characters, gear and tons of different plots. 

For people new to RP games it can be a bit overwhelming. This isn't Baldur's Gate, nor Diablo, nor a JRPG. This is...an open world with REAL LIFE restrictions: it takes you time to travel, people get tired and hungry, there's not endless creatures to fight and you CAN'T CARRY EVERYTHING! 

Your old personal fantasy of going to magical land and being a hero...that takes time, money and work. There are things out there that are bigger and meaner, than you, and they will eat you...quickly.

In it's unrelenting attempt to inject some reality into a table-top roleplaying setting, this game leaves features ON that many of us DM's tend to TURN OFF. It's rather refreshing, though occasionally tedious and irritating,

This game is a great tool for DM's on ""what makes an encounter?"", ""How to string along a plot while giving players freedom?"" and mechanics other than combat, while also showing you combat with minis, without squares,

Adventurers tread with caution! This game is more of a simulator (especially on harder settings) than a video game. Which is why many solo players get frustrated with it...I know I certainly did. 

I honestly recommend playing this one with an active guide on, A real tabletop game has many people making many decisions all the time. This game has you doing the work of 4-6 people, that's a lot. Don't be shamed of asking for help. Character building is complicated in pathfinder, or any TTRPG for that matter. World building even more so.

I've revised this review because my first go at this game was NOT what I was used to, and it made me frustrated and disheartened. The updates they've made since have helped smooth out some kinks, but the roleplaying is still...rather realistic. You WON'T find all the hidden things, talk to all the right people (in just the right way), or even get things done in the perfect amount of time.....try to remember: THAT'S OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT, IT SHOULD BE UNIQUE TO YOU!

However, as a tip: see what all those features and options do, look around for click/check boxes, there's MANY features hidden on the screen and in the MANY menus, that will VASTLY improve your enjoyment.

I love how the passage of time matters, and that the maps will be light, dark, dim, sunny, cloudy, rainy, depending on the time of day and season. When traveling across the overworld map, you'll have to stop to rest up, or face the penalties of Exhaustion. Lots to love in this game.

But the positives are vastly outweighed by the frustrations, imo. There is no ""chance to hit"" indication when selecting an enemy, and I'm left to rage at the screen as my sorcerer with +5 CHA miss three Acid Spray attacks in a row. A party size of 6 sounds big until you actually start fighting, because you need all the help you can get. On ""Normal"" difficulty, I regularly lose one or three characters. Which normally wouldn't be an issue, but in this game, going down in combat carries permanent penalties, and permadeath is a threat. The writing and voice acting both feel very ""there because people expect it to be"" because most is Okay At Best.

It really does feel like a 1-to-1 adaptation of a Pathfinder tabletop campaign, for better or worse. But it's for the worse, because there are lots of things that work great in a group around a table that don't work in a CRPG.

This is a good game, but it has a specific audience in mind and doesn't care if you're not it. I recommend any of Obsidian's or Larian's CRPGs instead.

The CRPG! A beautiful and niche genre of games that never gets the library it truly deserves. As someone who absolutely loves CRPGs, I was quite excited to play Pathfinder: Kingmaker. It had been far too long since we've had a true game of the genre like Exile: Escape from the Pit, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and to a lesser extent Dragon Age: Origins. All of those games I cherish and love. I frequently go back to those masterpieces and their remakes because of how rare CRPGs are made these days.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker tries to follow in these wonderful predecessors, and succeeds in a sort.

But the developers made so many critical blunders I cannot recommend it.

Let's start with the combat system. All of it is tried and true to the Pathfinder system. If you haven't played pathfinder before, it is heavily inspired by DnD 3.5 edition. The combat engine itself is much better put together than other clunky attempts like Neverwinter Nights (NWN), and Kingmaker also has far fewer bugs than NWN 1 & 2.

Like Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, and Neverwinter Nights, this game also has a semi-realtime combat system that successfully implements the Pathfinder turn based systems in a format where all turns are run simultaneously. initiative is rolled and people who are lower on the initiative list have a delay at the start of combat then can take their actions in real time every 6 seconds. It works quite well, and I will say it is more transparent than any other CRPG to date.

The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is sufficient, and the music is fitting.

So why does a game that gets so much right also get the thumbs down from me? Terrible gameplay decisions. I've put about 3 hours into this game and will likely not be putting any more in.

You start off and fight your way through an assassin attack. This was actually done well, and teaches the player about a number of design elements of the game. It's moderately difficult as far as tutorial introductions go and is quite entertaining. There aren't many problems in the game's opening sequence. The problems occur about an hour later.

Fast forward to your first outpost. You receive a typical fetch quest from a local potion brewer. Pretty standard stuff, you go to a spider cave, fight off some giant spiders, pick some berries from a bush and be on your merry way. Many games have this type of quest and they typically work quite well. It adds optional content and a way of gaining experience if you so choose.

Except the developers screwed this up royally. You get a warning that the berries tend to attract kobolds. You think ""Perfect! Kobolds are low level enemies, they might have a spell caster or two to make things tricky and probably some ranged attacks. That might add a bit of challenge."" Except.... you don't really FIGHT any kobolds near the bush. You fight.... swarms of tiny spiders. You wouldn't think this is a challenge, but the idiot developers, in all their wisdom, made the spiders completely immune to all melee and physical range attacks. The only way of killing them is with AoE splash attacks.... which you aren't warned about. The characters it starts you off with don't even have ACCESS to AoE splash attacks through spells or abilities.

In fact, the only way to kill the spiders is if you by chance picked up AoE splash potions or if your character has access to arcane magic or if your bard levels up and you decide a bard (a typical SUPPORT character, not an AoE damager!) takes acid splash or the like. Fortunately for me, I randomly, without any hint or guide, had acid splash on my main character. Solves the problem right?

Nope. Acid splash usually does 1-2 damage... if you hit with it. And you are mostly going to MISS with this attack at level 2. The spider swarms have 9 life each. This means you need to go through about 15 rounds of combat just to kill 1 spider swarm with acid splash.

Not the end of the world, right? Just have your tanks hold the line, throw a few expendables at the spider while acid splashing the swarm! Except.... these spider swarms WILL kill your provided tanks even if they are in the best possible armor at the time of the encounter in 10 rounds or less. The ones they don't kill, they poison, which in most games is a minor inconvenience.

The poison: PERMANENTLY decreases your strength. Only way to fix it is through a priest casting restoration..... which the game doesn't give you a party member available who can cast this. Your only way of having access to this spell is if your character is a cleric.... which means you won't have access to the AoE arcane spells if you went down this route.

The game says you can rest and get cured from poison, but after resting 3 days straight, none of my character recovered from it. Oh, and your main quest is TIMED. This is all from your [i]first[/i] side quest, which you receive no warning, no foreshadowing, and no support to help complete. Entry level side quests are supposed to help the player learn about the game, get more proficient with the system, and have some fun additional content.

This side quest did help me learn about the game: it's poorly designed, frustrating, and the only way to beat it is through metagaming.

In the end, there are probably better titles in your steam library's backlog that are more worthy of your time. As for me, I'm installing Pillars of Eternity and seeing if the hype around that one is justified.",1632855914,1632855914,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

OK, I've finished the game now and HAD to share how truly terrible the last chapter is.

OMG, this was the worst final chapter of a game I remember ever playing. It was irritating, tedious, time-consuming... without giving away any spoilers... I felt like all the effort I mead to level up and develop my characters had been TOTALLY pointless as they rip characters away from you and cripple all of your abilities in every single TIRESOME fight.

I ended up switching to 'Story Mode' so I could find out how things ended after 160 hours play, but really, I just felt totally gutted that no matter WHAT I did (I was a pladinic character, always taking the path of good) people were always just complaining at me and calling me a tyrant.... Save the orphans... tyrant... Stop monsters killing people... tyrant... Let the people vote for their own leadership... tyrant. Seriously, pointless. I just started killing people that disagreed with me for no other reason than because it was simpler, quicker and appear to make no real difference to how people treated me anyway.

The ACTUAL ending was nice enough, but oh GAWD the last chapter of game play was complete fail.

Is this game worth the money....? I cannot really justify saying ""No"", because lets face it... it's entertained me for 100+ hours... but would I EVER play it again knowing what I know now? Nope... I mean bang for buck I got allot of time out of this game what what I paid, but that does not mean I'm happy about the utter rubbish I've been delivered in the end.

You will indeed find yourself wondering around flattening things in R.E. most of the time before being poopped upon by some god-awfaully punishingly difficult fight that you never stood a chance of winning....

What I also found in these situations however is that there was usually just something I was doing wrong or had not done that lead to this situation. Either failing to infultrate a base instead of just wondering in the front door, or perhaps a simple protection spell that reduces the enemy's main attack damage, etc.

Overall, I've not met something I could not beat yet, but yes, the difficulty is set to either inconsiquetially easy or damn hard.... there is very little middle ground.

That aside, I loved the elements of Strategy, in building your Kingdom, it's not a mechanic I have come across in an RPG before (not saying there are not other out there, just that it's the first one I have personally played) and it was fun and rewarding.

The need to ignore things you would like NOT to due to not having enough people to do things is irritating, but hay, you cannot do everything, which is (I guess) the point.

The levelling system is highly varied, flexible and fun (IMO) with tons of classes and sub-classes to choose from, though why you would not be a fighter... the end... is beyond me.

I personally love playing mages and rouges normally, but there are patches of the game where you get separated from your party and have to solo.... If there was one thing that made me rage, it was this. I was a monk at the time and it was only because is speced him to be a little tanky that I managed to survive (having uses every single item I had in my inventory, save-load-die-save-load-die until the 'rolls' go in my favour on EVERY occation) that I even made it limping out. But if I were a mage, it would have been totally impossible, as once you got to the 3 monster and you were out of spells, you would be dead!

This aspect of the game was highly disapointing and made playing anything but a fighter class that is able to solo when needed totally impossible. Fortunately, the game allows you to totally re-spec your character and the NPC 3 times for free and then you can pay in-game gold to do it again after that. Needless to say, I re-specced as a fighter and then get my spell casting jollies out using the NPCs.

On the whole, I like the game and enjoy playing it. The plot is good and most importantly, I always feel I know what I need to do next.

Get it if you like RPGs, but play a solo-class ;-)",1623249802,1632656702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The difficulty must be noted- I found the game quite challenging on normal mode, despite understanding character builds and classes- this game is not for the faint of heart. On a similar note, it is very long, taking me over 100 hours to complete a playthrough. (Some of this is probably attributable to my use of turn-based combat for the majority of the run).

The game is by no means perfect, however. Especially on higher difficulties, the enemy density in some dungeons is very high, necessitating large numbers of rests. The story, while not un-compelling, drags out to the point that it sometimes feels like a long series of largely unconnected events. 

Also, the final dungeon sucks.",1632637414,1632637414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is my salvation. Pathfinder split off from D&D before the latter became simplified so it may look initially daunting but it's worth it. 

While there is a sense of an overriding grand quest the main story arcs are broken up into chapters that are suitably epic and satisfying. While a threat exists in your new found Barony it should be the focus of your attention because things can get out of hand very quickly. Once dealt with you will have some time to explore, do side quests and trawl dungeons before the next shadow appears on the horizon. The action is often broken up with ""choose your own adventure"" style narrative segments which add a lot of flavour to the proceedings. The writing is solid with a decent blend of drama, humour and a host of misaligned misfits.

One element that did catch me flat footed was the running of the Barony. That is something you may want to read the wiki on early in piece. Building new villages is handled on the map, there are technically three maps views. Don't be like me, use the correct map instead of assuming there are just no suitable sites. Problems should be dealt with promptly, Opportunities should be your next priority. Then Events. Some Events can run time forwards up to two weeks so plan around that. Also worth knowing, you can cancel an event to free up someone for an urgent Problem. It will go back in the queue and you will get a partial refund on the BP. At times having to keep dashing back into range to keep the Barony running can feel like an annoyance but you'll quickly find a rhythm to it. 

To get the full pen and paper experience switch to turn based combat. You can switch back and forth freely but it took the game to the next level for me. The devil really is in the details, there will be encounters you are not equipped for. If things are not working out pause and read the enemy description and read the detailed combat logs. Don't be afraid to bravely run away if you have to. Remember to use bardic inspiration or the cleric cantrip Inspiration before doing DC checks outside of combat. Keep an eye on the little buff / debuff icons next to the character portraits. The ranger in the party got blinded during a fight. The cleric was able to cast Remove Blindness without an issue. A short while later I notice the icon is back on the ranger. This time it is Blinding Disease. The ranger was two days and a couple of bad dice rolls away from going blind. Trust me on this, a blind archer at the back of the party is a liability so we went back to camp at the earliest opportunity so the cleric could prepare Remove Disease. Another couple of things you will find handy to know, you can see the day of the week by hovering over the hourglass next to the control panel. There is also a control to change or dismiss party members while on the main map but this will incur a time cost. Surprisingly important in a few spots.

One minor gripe I do have is the alignment shifting dialogue choices. They are great idea and work well for the most part but sometimes I think the choice should be on a single axis only. For instance a choice might be a stark good versus evil thing but it is set as Neutral Good versus Neutral Evil. This will shift a Lawful or Chaotic character closer to Neutral which can impact some class abilities as well as building options in the Barony.

All in all this is a fantastic CRPG. Take your time with it, play at least your first play through without a guide. Make bad choices, live with the bad dice rolls and if your Barony ends up in ruins know you can at least re-roll with a better idea of what you are doing. It is quite refreshing to play a CRPG where you can actually lose. I highly recommend it.

Last tips to address problems commonly encountered. Swarms don't take much damage except from AoE, have melee characters equip a torch in one of their alternative weapon slots. Buy at least one Bag of Holding early on and remember that a lot of loot is not worth the weight. Camping under the stars is free, for everything else you'll need extra rations. Sometimes it just pays to head back to the surface of a dungeon to camp so you can hunt and cook.

I may change my review later on, if I return to the game. But right now, after 83 hours real time, playing on Normal difficulty and having been fucked by RNG kingdom events and outcomes (Valery is the worst regent ever, her success rate is seemingly 20%) one too many times -- after another 8 hour session today and multiple ""feasts"" to try and prevent the inevitable, my kingdom crumbled. Stability was fucked the whole play-through, despite everything I did, including selling almost any worthwhile unused item I had to get those precious BPs to be ultimately squandered on incremental kingdom updates that could never turn the tide.

And all this after having been enthralled for weeks with the gameplay. I admit upfront that I am not a great strategist in CRPGs. I love to play them for story and characterization and the adventuring aspects. I play turn-based, whenever I can. I try to live with the results as I go, even if they are detrimental, but I also have save-scummed my way past some ridiculous sections (those enemies that remove levels can fuck off, honestly). There are some dungeons and encounters here that truly hate your time, lulling you into a false sense of security for two hours before killing everything about your party in the final encounters. That final dungeon in chapter 3 brought me to the point of uninstalling the game, but then I lowered the difficulty to ""Easy"" for one particular fight with two water elementals that resurrected themselves to fuck my party even more. That was the only time and it seriously destroyed my enjoyment for a while, since I wanted to play on Normal all the way through, but was absolutely not going to throw away hours of progress just to ""respec"".

Kingmaker is a wonderful, wonderful game full of great ideas and some terrible, terrible difficulty spikes and RNGs that do not give a shit about the player. I respect and am a little bit afraid of people who manage to play this on the hardest difficulty and thrive, which either means I am a complete idiot (not necessarily unlikely) or they spend hundreds and hundreds of hours into learning everything about the game. Something which I just cannot do. I mostly am able to play on the weekends and then I do not even remember all the spells I have available.

So here I am, off to a tournament in the West, but just before I arrive a random event fucks my kingdom to the state of destroyed. The game mocks my inability to play it by giving me the chance to have an ""invincible kingdom"". A final fuck you, just shy of auto-selecting and locking me into ""Story mode"" on the next load. But you know what? I just stopped caring. ""My"" kingdom died, my king (despite being oh so loved) died and everyone in the kingdom died. I hope that tournament was shite and the main antagonist can run amok on the world for all I care.

Such a great game, but it hates me with a passion and I stopped giving a shit. Maybe sometime in the future I will try again. Maybe I will buy the sequel.

So I'm not familiar with the setting, but the rules and setting are close enough to generic Faerun/D&D-esque high fantasy world that it'll essentially just be the names of places/geography/history you'll be unfamiliar with.

That said the game is challenging, in part because D&D rules don't translate well to these kinds of games, and in part because of the... ""story"", I guess, but mostly it's contrived difficult. As in, you will face such a deluge of such insanely powerful monsters you'll hardly believe it. There is a fairly interesting story reason for it, but it's also the case that enemies will just randomly have, say, a Blur-like effect constantly in effect on them which causes many of your attacks to miss. There isn't a reason for it. If you dispel it, the effect automatically returns the next round without the enemy having to take an action. Overall it's clear that the developers simply wanted to make encounters difficult without having to add in new enemies. So instead you fight armies of enemies that are always protected by concealment no matter what. It's alright, but it shows the shallowness of the well they're drawing from.

The poor game balance is also obvious when you consider spells. By FAR the most powerful spells are summon spells. Virtually every other spell requires the enemy to fail a saving throw, or you to land a ranged attack, or you to overcome the enemy's spell resistance. Or all three. Meaning, thanks to the RNG, you could exhaust numerous spells for zero benefit at all. Or... you could just summon a shitload of powerful allies who have a pile of hp, do good damage, and persist for multiple rounds of combat. 

The most unique aspect is probably the kingdom management. It's very novel, but because you're constantly fighting the clock and (as with combat) totally at the whim of the RNG in terms of whether something works or not, it can be very annoying to deal with. Fortunately there are mods that make it less tedious. I don't think I would play the game without the Kingdom Resolution mod, for example.

So overall, it's a bit shallow, the combat is pretty imbalanced and annoying due to its reliance on RNG mechanics, and the kingdom element is both interesting and new and also tedious as hell without mods. I definitely recommend the game overall, but Pathfinder: Kingmaker's somewhat low rating mostly reflects that it's not for everyone.",1615385200,1632579118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So if you are still considering whether you want to play it or not, well few words from me :)

First of all, this game is an excellent RPG (as a role play). I was able to play as I imagine my character almost without any forced choices (there are few, and of course there is limitation of game story and game engine). Ending + ending slides feel like a coronation of choices of my character through the game. Ending itself was super satisfying.
However game like to limit some very fun choices in this game behind you character alignment (good, evil, chaotic neutral, lawful), as far as I know there is mod to address this (It's called Bag of Tricks on Nexus) or you can reset your alignment in game before major choice

Game have a big potential for a quality of life improvement and some performance issues. I didn't encounter anything major but keep that as a game engine it's not perfect.

Combat is fun, I highly recommend turn base order than real time gameplay (occasionally switching for real time to...clean up large numbers of weaker enemies). Turn order allows you to use all those abilities, spells, items etc. that you may not bother yourself otherwise in real time game play.
I don't consider this game to be super difficult, mostly due to turn order which allow you to have better control overall, but it can have it moments (let's say anty fear/poison/stun and other buffs are mandatory for some game segments)
I have played with no disatvengates for enemies (weaker crits, less health or stats) and didn't go for any more serious min/maxing during my playthru.
Game will probably end before you can reach max level (20), i was able to reach 19 before final encounter, and 20 just after it (quite completionist run...with some exception for role play reasons (let's say one of my companion didn't survive due to....disagreement :D)

Companions are great, to be honest one of the best I had pleasure to play with in my ""vast"" experience with cRPGs. And if you don't want to play with them, or do some more serious min/maxing you can make custom companion (you will be controlling 6 character thru the game)

Kingdom management, eh, kinda boring aside of working with you advisories (which shape you kingdome...reflected by end of game slides)
At this point it's also worth mentioning that the game at some point will force you to proceed by giving you a time limit.
I don't consider this as a problem for exploration or questing, but it could be a problem if you would like to perfect your kingdom management.

Anyway, I highly recommend this game for any isometric cRPG fan. I place it among my all time favorites (BG2, Neverwinter Night 2, Pillars of eternity 2 and now Pathfinder Kingmaker).
And just as you finish this one, you can go to Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (Didn't play it yet, so I just keeping my hopes up :D)

The good in comparison to NWN:

* World is 10x bigger and better
* Move silently and Hide are combined into ""Stealth""
* Many characters which weren't vary viable in NWN now have power
* Leaving area allows to see and grab all the items on cleared map
* Inventory management is easier - no need to open magic bags they just allow to carry more, no need to care about shape and cells weapons take - imo much more pleasant to work with
* Graphics about 20-30% better, considering the 17 year gap it could be put in bad section as well. You can get used to but Baldurs Gate 3 knows better.

The bad:
* One of the most rushing games out of there, timer for everything, it makes you hate the game with every hour passing by and the game is long! So the torture will be there.
* No action queue in 2018? Is that for real? Forcing me to play turn-based. NWN 1 allowed that in 2001. 
* AI Pathfinding in pathfinder is crap
* Performance on 3090 is crap (performance is deterriorating - you need to clean up save games and restart game to get back your fps, engine is broken, gpu barely works at 40%)
* Characters gets stuck here and then
* Level loading is slow
* Character management window is incovenient, you need to scroll to right, you won't even ""find"" this in first 10 hours of the game
* Char design screen is bland so it is hard to focus or find abilities - want to know which armor your character can wear - good luck
* Spell animation and look doesn't feel as epic as in NWN though I still can't cast the most powerful spell, the fireball for instance just doesn't feel epic
* Monsters which bizzarely don't die without an obscure ""cold iron weapon"" , killed a massive dragon? Good luck it won't die because you are missing the ""right"" weapon. And don't throw DnD expertise on me - monster should not be alive after it is bashed while laying down for 1000 dmg and still breathe. Cold could just disable regen not be condition of death.

I have never played Pathfinder Tabletop, but I have played other DnD variant based games and most of them (the good ones at least) knew the fat to cut from the Tabletop in order to deliver a more fun videogame

This game refuses to do that and is basically a TT session without a Dungeon Master to pace things correctly and make the overall journey challenging, fun and fair.

If you decide to try and adhere to default settings (Normal Enemy Crits, Normal Enemy Toughness, etc) like you would in another game, you'll face an immediate difficulty cliff. If you don't have indepth, almost encyclopedical knowledge of the base game (or aren't following premade, online builds) your characters will be gimped for most of the early game.

It's all in the little things: if don't class your MC as a mage that knows fire spells and don't know in advance that you'll face Swarms in the next map/dungeon and therefore buy literally dozens of bombs, prepare to have the worst time of your life as your characters slowly whittle away the enemy's HP bar with Torches.

What if you do overprepare and buy tons of hardcounter items and weapons? Congrats your character is not only slower in combat, but outside of combat as well, making this a not viable choice.

What about when you decide to rest (something this game requires to do way too often for a DnD type of game IMO) and get a quest that gives your MC nightmares, making them unable to sleep and be Exhausted all time? Congrats, your gimped character might as well not have legs since they'll move so slow the snails in the background environment actually move fast than you. And this doesn't apply only to in-combat speed, the character will move slow outside of it as well and you'll waste a ton of time as they trudge away to the rest of your party.
And good luck if you're outdoors and a storm hits. Enjoy the next 5 minutes watching your whole party being forced to move slowly.

Another problem this game has (and is probably the TT rules' fault) is that enemies are designed with a ton of AC, which will see you missing most of your attacks, especially in the early game. It just doesn't feel good to see miss, after miss, after miss, after miss. It makes you feel as if you have little control over combat, since you don't want to waste your precious few spells/abilities with trash enemies (and shouldn't!). But the game seems to be designed around you using those abilities even in minor combat, which further slows down the already slow pace since you'll need to rest to recover those spells since you won't ever know when you'll be ambushed.
Pillar of Eternity for instance, found a nice middle-ground, where even if you fail, an attack roll, you can still do less damage, rendering the combat there not a matter of if, but when, since you always feel like you're whittling down your opponent as combat goes on (and vice-versa towards you)
In here, you either have more than enough attack bonuses that it's trivial and pretty much succeed all your rolls, or you don't and see your party hopelessly fail to hit a single Kobold that somehow has more AC than your tank of a fighter, Fighting Defensively, absolutely decked in Heavy Armour and with a Towershield.

And by far the worst aspect of this game: enemies such as simple cave spiders, have attacks that can permanently lower your stats. The only way to restore those stats is to either go to certain clerics which will heal you (for a fee), use restoration potions/spells (which cost you) or use restoration spells yourself (which cost you time AND money because you need to rest to restore those spells).
And these stat damaging abilites are far, FAR too common for how crippling they are. Going to a cave with spiders? Congrats, your 2nd row Barbarian damage dealer is now 100% useless because their poison permanently lowered their Strength main-stat to 2. And if it gets reduced to 0, they die. And can only be brought back with (expensive) spells, which cost you even more gold.

Another pet-peeve is how everyone always starts combat flat-footed (which doesn't allow you to use your DEX bonus for AC), supposedly because you're ""caught unaware at the start of combat"". But this happens even when YOUR party is the combat instigator. In fact everyone except the character that started combat (be it you or the enemy) start off flat footed.
This is a questionable design choice since it makes DEX heavy builds very vulnerable, especially to ranged attacks and spells because they usually have very low AC without those bonuses.

Other games either do hard rolls for skills checks so you can't reroll again and have to live with that outcome, or automatically fail if you don't have the skill high enough, but here you can reroll trying to climb a downed tree over and over and hope you get lucky. But beware since your WHOLE PARTY will be damaged from failed rerolls which further encourages save-scumming.

Even simple things such as the lack of a minimap or the ability to just make your character move faster outside of combat. Which they can do, but only when you click far away from their starting position. It doesn't even have downsides if you get attacked while moving faster like this, so why not make it a double-click action...

The story is ok and the graphics are serviceable, but nothing outstanding.

If you know Pathfinder rules inside out and are a seasoned TT veteran, then you'll know what to expect and will probably have a good time.

Other RPG players used to games such as Baldur's Gate, Pillar of Eternity or Divinity: Original Sin will probably find this game disappointing due to how restrictive and against the player it is",1632440972,1632441423,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a basic sense this game is it's own worst enemy. Don’t get me wrong. I have sunk over 400 hours into this game as the pseudo pathfinder system is enthralling and the overall story is immersive. However my face is often red from /facepalming over a glitching game engine and still very beta game-play. I was going to do a pros vs. cons for this game but it is really worth experiencing yourself. If this genre is you cup of tea then you will enjoy it. My advice is take your time during combat. The game engine can’t handle itself and somehow your FPS will drop to 1 even using an RTX 3080. This will cause you to miss click and screw up a move.

150 hours into the game i got an achievment: 100 completed kingdomquests  (or something like that). You get those 100 at some point in the game automatically becuase you have to solve those kingdomquests. 17.1% of all players achieved that, the game tells me.

I dont know how long this game will go on but ill leave it at that. 

It looks like they didn't bother to finish the game and neither will I.
I give the game 17% of 100 ;) as a rating.


While the Fights and the character-creation are really awesome everything else fails. 

Kingdom Managment is a mess and not intuitive at all. When ur kingdom falls there is actually a checkbox under the ""load last save""-button that says: Make kingdom invulnerable. I guess at some point even the creators of the game realized they messed up. 

The Map is gigantic and while that seems great at first, it turns out that constant loading screens and traveling around a lot, is like the most time consuming part of the game.

The Dungoens and overworld maps look really great but thats all. The map layout, most of the time, is unimaginitive and boring. Also some maps keep popping up again and again just with different enemies. 

The Story is there. Thats all i can say about it. 

I played a six dwarf team, and their beards kept changing colors from time to time. And for some reason there was no ball and chain on the flail. It was just a long stick. Again I am getting the feeling they didn't bother to finish the game. Especially when there are add-ons available.... Why add more content when the rest doesn't work properly.

If you like reading a boring book with a lot of fights in it, that you are allowd to play, than Pathfinder Kingmaker is the game for you.

Old review:

So nothing seemed to work for me. I tried the one thing that works in every rpg. The band of retarded barbarians with the social skills of, well retarded barbarians. My Character was named:
Onan der Wichser wich rouighly translates to: Mastur the Masturbator. Finally battles seemed to work, it only took me 10 minutes to kill the f******** Spider swarm. Problem is, now battles are boring as hell.

So if u like to torture uself and are some kind of self abusive flagellant: play this. Everyone else buy something else. Or burn the money. At least that will keep u warm for a minute or so.

Thrid Review:

Yeah what else can i say. After a rough start i gave it another try. Again. Here is my experience summed up: Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0), Miss, reduced Damage (0),.... and so on. You can probably guess my joy. This game is terrible even after reading up on the rules in the Internet ( bc ingame Encyclopedia isn't really helpful ) it still sucks.

Don't spend money on this, burn it so it keeps u warm 2 seconds. That would be a better investment. This game is just bad. 

New Review:

So some Dude made a Mod so u can play this game in turnbased mode. Sounds cool. Since my first impression of the game wasn't the best i wanted to give it another try. I played it until after the outpost ( at the beginnig of the game ) and then i remembered something i read in another rewiev. I remembered it when i encountered a spider swarm. G* F*** Y*******. The h*** is worng with you. Its almost like you dont want the player to enjoy this p**** op* s***. Im really pissed. I spent money on this bullshit so i could enjoy it. Not to watch some retards stand around a spiderswarm not being able to do anything at all. Stop making games you t****.

The Game is still terrible. There are a lot of bugs and even leaving the bugs aside nothing seems to make sense.  


Old Review:

( Character Creation was awesome and i was really thrilled. Even the Story was somehow interesting.

But WTF is this comabt-system?? I can't see a thing. Every few seconds u have to pause so u have the slightest control over what is happening and even then some skills just can't be activated. This really annoys the c*** out of me. Why the h*** is this not turn based. In 37 years i never was so confused playing an rpg. If you want to know how a good combat-system is done, take a look at divinity 2 or x-com. Even Pillars of Eternity stupid CRPG combat-system was good compared to this pile of a**. )",1557691307,1632260091,False,3,0,0.392560064792633057,1,True,False,False

Also the encounter design is terrible, too.

This game has save breaking encounters that can cost you hours of progress.

I like this game, I think it could be a good game, but it's not because it does the ultimate sin in gaming; it adds the ""lol rekted, lets ruin your save"" moments.

Normally this game saves when you enter an area, so if you die you have to the entire area again, so that's already a bit of a time waster but that's alright. After playing the game for about 5 hours I see a camp that has some corpses littered around it. I failed a check to see how they died, but don’t think too hard about it because this area is full of corpses that have died to the local wildlife. I take a rest at the camp and is suddenly ambushed by a flying skull which is way higher level than my team (at this point level 2) and it proceeds to mob the floor with me. Mind you that every other enemy in this area is level 1-2.

“It’s cool” I think to myself, “I’ll just reload and avoid this encounter”. But as I load my save it starts me at the beginning of the ambush instead of at the beginning of the area, whereupon I die again. I try to run from the encounter, but since the skull fears all my characters it will kill half of my team before I can run. I look online and they say that you have to have some resistance spells which I can’t equip because whenever I load it starts from the encounter.

The only escape for me is to reload from an older save and lose 3 hours of progress. Then when I learned that this is not the only such encounter in the game, the kind where you have no way to beat the encounter unless you are clairvoyant or read about it online, I decided to give this game a negative review.

You can tell me that this game has lots of versatility, that the writing is good or that since I can’t peer into the 4th dimension that I’m a bad gamer, but this won’t change the fundamental truth. Adding save breaking moments in your game is the sign that you’re either a bad programer or a bad designer. These moments are not fun for the player, it wastes their time, and for what; so that the designer can have a mild chuckle during development? To me, this is like showing up to an exam and starting by pouring paint over the paper. I don’t care if you could actually answer all the questions on the exam, this is something you just don’t do and you should know that.

So if you're cool with quick saving every 2 minutes and reading guides online for your first play through so you can avoid these kinds of encounters, then be my guest. If not, Divinity 2: Original Sin is a much better game.

My biggest problem lies at the heart of the plot – the game never establishes character motivation for the main character. The story revolves around becoming a ruler but never stops to ask “why”. We never find out why the main character cares to gain the title, or why every other person would rather serve. That core lack of motivation strips the story of meaning and impact and each presented decision becomes a meaningless act of balancing stats. Unfortunately, in an attempt to create a story that can revolve around a diverse set of possibilities across the spectrum of races/classes/alignments the developers created a story that revolves around a blank-slate who stands apart and doesn’t really belong in the world that they inhabit. This game is often compared to Baldur’s Gate but it couldn’t be further, and worse off, from it in this particular aspect.

Unfortunately the companion characters are not much better. They are boring, one-dimensional archetypical cliches who in most cases can be succinctly described using a single characteristic of their personality. It’s very rare that they will surprise you with their dialogue or have anything insightful to say about any of the events in the game. In general, there is very little introspection in the story – big events come and go but no one really offers much of a reaction beyond a single line of dialogue here and there. Again, when compared to Baldur’s Gate it legitimately feels like “shallowness of BG 1’s characters but delivered in a script that is multiple times larger” – a classic case of talking too much and saying too little.

The pacing and the overall gameplay may be the weakest aspect of the experience. There are strengths here but the game does not lean on them at all. It is a wonderful, deep implementation of the Pathfinder system and would serve a turn-based tightly designed experience very well. Instead of that, the game mixes and matches systems that don’t work and insists of padding everything with meaningless, time wasting filler. 

Starting with the combat the game shines during challenging, well thought out turn-based encounters but those are extremely rare. Instead, most of the time it throws hordes and hordes of cannon fodder that will test anyone’s patience, even when played in the real time with pause mode.

Anything to do with being a ruler/managing the kingdom is just horrible – having to keep returning to the same place to make decisions that don’t have much impact; the obtuse base building and upgrade system that clashes horribly with all other aspects of the gameplay; the arbitrary success/failure system of every event; the watching numbers go up nature of it all.. I don’t understand why anyone wanting to play an RPG would see these as anything other than poorly designed distractions and yet it’s core to the experience – the game, after all, is about being a ruler and this is it, and unfortunately it just sucks. 

Another big portion of the game is spent on travelling and it’s not great either. Too much time is dedicated to watching a dot move along the various roads on the world map. It’s not fun, it’s not engaging and once again it’s somehow worse than what existed in BG1 where you would click on a destination and the game would load it right away. It was quick, simple and kept the focus on what the game does best. 

One other thing that absolutely needs to be discussed are the dice rolls. It is not fun to regularly fail a dice roll and take damage. It is also not fun to fail a dice roll and end up unable to open a chest until your party levels up. You know the drill by now, BG1 did it better. Arbitrary success/failure states work well in tabletop scenarios because they lead down two divergent paths and each can be used to tell an engaging, interesting story.  Arbitrary success/failure states in computer games do not work well because they cause you to miss out on things without the benefit of a divergent path and save-scumming really really isn’t fun. If you want to have them in the game, limit them to the interactive story-book sequences where multiple outcomes can be explored in interesting ways.",1631297528,1631903766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a soft lock a short ways into the main quest, resting at a specific campsite spawns a phantom or some such monster with 30+ AC and a fear effect that scatters your pawns.

In trying to emulate everything the tabletop games have to offer this game has accomplished being incredibly difficult. It will take time and effort tuning the game settings, of which there are many, to get the experience you want. Starting this game I went with the ""Challenging"" difficulty as I've played tabletop DnD and Pathfinder for over 20 years. The game is incredibly unforgiving and I'm not sure how anyone can accomplish playing it on higher than normal difficulties. My experience on challenging with all the tabletop rules in place led to me doing little more than standing in combat trying to kill even one kobold, which could manage to wipe out my entire party due to never rolling basic hits. When I did manage to get a little farther into the game encumbrance and having to rest after basically every combat became the death of me. It was hard to enjoy literally anything the game had to offer. Before giving up and moving on I decided to tweak the settings for a custom game.

Starting on Normal difficulty and enabling critical strikes for enemies, encumbrance rules, turning off death's door, and setting the enemy power to an even 1.0 rating made for a far better experience. There is plenty of story and lore to enjoy, some aspects are still mildly tedious but not everything is meant to be easy. Combat can take thought and proper positioning or tactics. The level scaling is still a little rough where you'll run into some monsters one or two levels ahead of you, then suddenly there's a boss double your level. It doesn't quite make sense where in terms of CR that's an impossible fight to win. Sure you can come back later but it's disheartening to clear an entire dungeon except for the one part you actually need because it's scaled so high.

It's because of the amount of fine tuning the game requires to be playable that I am still leaving a thumbs down. It can be enjoyable, but if you are easily frustrated I encourage you to stay away from this title.",1631229781,1631744362,False,1,1,0.498627066612243652,0,True,False,False

In the hours I've put into this game , I became immersed in the lore , the dialogue , and the banter that my NPC's made with each other .

The spells and graphics were nice . Camping out in the middle of the wilderness was a treat , and watching my main character tend to the campfire or kill really got me into this game . Sadly , all the good things about this game came to an end , when I automatically lost when I didn't meet the three month deadline to take on the Stag Lord .

You see , I love playing rpg games . When I play rpg games such as Pathfinder , the first thing I usually do , is gather my party ,take them out in the wild , and level them up killing monsters and other creatures . Not only do I like leveling up my character and NPC's , I also like to grind for their gear .

Once my NPC's are maxed level , and geared out , I take them to do the quest . Sadly , that's not the case here . Had I known there was a time limit to which I could do things , I wouldn't have bought this game . 

Now for other problems . The range enemies in this game doesn't seem to follow a line of sight . An example of this , is when my rogue was low on health . I placed her behind a wall to regain some health , only for an arrow to go through the wall , and finish off my main character .

Second problem I have , is there's no pickpocket feature , or there's not a lot for a rogue to do . Besides the missing features I noted , I actually had fun with this class .

As for other problems , the fact that most of the weapons in this game looks the same . Most of the tower shields look the same , and all the other weapons looks the same . More could've been done in this department .

Adding to more problems that I faced , monsters and npc's that you kill out in the wild have crappy drops . Everytime I had an encounter , I killed them , only to receive basic weapons , and little to zero magical items . it would be nice if you get a good reward for killing a very dangerous foe .

Other than the time limits that's been placed on this game , I actually had fun . Now will I go and buy the sequel ? I really don't know , since I'm not into time limits being placed on my rpg games .

Seriously though, I was very surprised how quickly the style changed after the first ""boss"". I absolutely LOVED the first 12 hours I had in this game and it was a blast doing the turn based combat for the most of it. Truly a spectacular way of intentionally planning out the battlefield. However, having met a spirit skull head thingy and found myself missing 98% of the attacks, I ""accidentally"" switched to real-time and... it's also awesome :D Though it definitely takes away from the strategic combat unless you use the pause feature. I call it the ""lazy play"" :P 

But yeah, after becoming a baron, it's still fun but not ""as fun"" for me. I like seeing the barony spread but I also fell in love with the emphasis/style of the first 12 hours I played and now feel like it's a completely different game xD It's like playing Spores because you love creating your own creature and making your own decisions and then out of no where it's less role-play and more rts xD #lovethecomparison

But, as I wasted 100 hours trying to have fun with this game, I'll try to resume them at the best of my ability :
Kingmaker is a big case of ""lot of good ideas but none properly used"".
If you're fan of Pathfinder, don't even try it : the game doesn't respect anything from it, weither it's the ennemies, magic, even how offensive and defensive stats are handled is messed up, if you're knowledgeable about Pathfinder's Lore,the amount of nonsense in this game will drive you mad.
The difficulty settings are one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen in a video game, to the point that even trying to play in ""standard"" difficulty requires to be masochistic. Simply resumed : the difficulty level mainly provides damage reduction, and every difficulty stage increase at the same time the number AND the strength of all ennemies (a simple zombie gains a +6 attack boost just by going from easy to standard), this combined with the fact that difficulty also provide player characters a passive damage reduction (which shows how boosted the ennemies are) and said reduction scales down with every difficulty level, not only do the ennemies hit you far more easily they also punch much harder. On top of that your own equipement is constantly nerfed (armor bonuses not cumulative, just as a small example) which means that you just get pummeled to the ground in every single fight, even against the most basic of ennemies.
And speaking of ennemies, It's just icing on the cake at this point but I'll say it nonetheless : they cheat... All the time... The AI simply doesn't play under the same rules as you do : they can spam abilities that are supposed to have limited use, can freely use spells and abilities that are supposed to have restriction (sneak attacks in particular are a complete mess), they all get passive camouflage bonuses after a certain level, meaning you can't even touch them even if it doesn't make any sense (like a 8 meters tall giant getting 50% camouflage) and their own defensive stats don't make any sense as well ( you defeat a skeleton with 26 armor class but realise the armor he was equiped gave it only 5, leaving 11 armor points coming from plot armor)
The part about handling your kingdom is atrocious, to the point that most players use the ""auto-gestion"" option and simply ignores it. It's a waste of time (takes 14 days just to upgrade 1 stat), it's bugged as heck and the RNG used to solve events is broken to the point of rivaling the Xcom series RNG. It was supposed to be one of the core mecanics of the game (KING-maker, it's in the name), and it's easily the worst part of it, to the point you're better off discarding it to focus on adventuring instead.

All in all, I bought the game with great expectations, and tried my best to have fun with it, but that's just not possible. There are far too many issues that accumulate for this game to be considered good, and that's a shame cause it's got a lot of good ideas spread all around it",1631503253,1631503253,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""game over, do you choose to reload and lose hours of work?"" etc. The problem is, there's nothing telling you 'go here, do this"" or putting any sort of urgency on finishing this main quest. There is some information but it's definitely not front and center.

Even reading all of the quest texts, half of the quests in the journal say what happened, not what needs to be happening next to advance quests. Some do but most dont.

I love CRPGs and have dumped hours into them, for example, both the old and new Divinities, old Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternities, and more. And this game genuinely felt like I was playing a tabletop game with ample opportunities to roleplay and narrative skill checks, as well as the ability to play with turn-based combat and show the dice rolls on hits/misses or other attempts. Your character builds really matter.

The story is also engaging and mysterious, and the kingdom management part of the game was refreshing and so much fun. I found myself agonizing over which advisors to send where and what choices to make to improve my kingdom's stats. There are also settlements to populate with buildings that also raise kingdom stats. Of course, on my first try I absolutely ran my kingdom into the ground because I didn't quite understand the depths of the mechanics, but that just makes me want to play it again with what I know now.

I dropped 90+ hours into this game (the free play weekend is not reflected in the current total) and still have the final act to complete. I can't wait to finish and play Wrath of the Righteous, and then go back and play this again. I really got in those hours in the most unhealthy way possible, which is to say, by sacrificing sleep.

Only if you are familiar with Pathfinder or others of this type (baldurs gate, icewind dale, pillars of eternity, pool of radiance, lionheart, tyranny, etc).

1. The game expects you to know everything of the bat. From the character creation screen you are flooded with classes, terms, spells, feats, abilities, etc. While there are tooltips to explain everything, expect spending a few hours reading through everything trying to understand it. If you are familiar with the other games it should be easy, but again, not for a first timer. You could just pick whatever you want and set the difficulty down if you struggle but that seems to defeat the purpose.


2. The time system is irritating. All these games have a calendar and time. But for most it is background noise. In this game you have to keep track of dates and deadlines and how soon you have to be somewhere kind of spoils the adventuring nature.


3. There is a kingdom builder type mechanic in this game. Its rudimentary but not the kind of thing I expected to spend hours doing when I wanted an adventure romp.

Its a little clunky with all the classes and different ac and touch attacks that go with strength and ranged touch attacks go with dexterity, so your sorcerer can need dexterity for ranged spells. Stuff like that means it takes your first playthrough to learn these things reading the wiki and googling. But its so worth it because its like a hardcore verison of dnd and i am a big fan of learning the dnd worlds, so i cant believe i get to play this game like 4 times total (atleast once solo) and then play the new one path of the wraitous after a year when all the bugs are all being fixed, and then I will walk into baldurs gate 3  like a pro. Now this game is so good, that i am worried i will spoil bg3 experience and not be hyped anymore because im used to this more complex game, but thats why i recommend this game to people it is really actually that good. Kingdom managment is just like an advisor system where you choose and advisor to solve a problem(military or economic etc) and it takes like 2 weeks to 45 days or for long ones 90 days to solve. then your benefit gets some bonuses. Its not that bad you just have to do a lot of travaling once a month back to your home town,/ capital city. I recommend you try it on your first play through, i like it so im even doing it on my evil playthrough to see the differences, but if i do more playthroughs after i would turn it off. but i think its acually key on first playthrough because you get way more lore and story building, and understand the world your in way better instead of just killling monsters and working on your build.  10/10

Edit: I forgot my number one tip, find the difficulty that is best for you. it will take some trial and error, but my favorite so far is challenging, but i go into the settings and turn damage enemies do to 0.3. This way we have drawn out fights, and its hard to hit them, but when they hit you it wont kill you unless you plan the battle really bad, or you reach the wrong area at the wrong time. so if you are level 3 and you see a huge fire elemental, especially to go pick up kalikke quest, just turn the enemy monsters to easy for that fight because you are in the wrong area, then back to stronger enemies for the west side of the map the narlmarches. just a couple of uneven fights like that.

I really wanted to like this game, as a DnD player but Pathfinder Kingmaker feels like a bad tabletop session organized by a DM who doesn't know what he's doing. The quests and the encounters are so badly design that sometimes, the only way to win is to do the encounter over and over again and getting lucky with rolls. The pacing is ridiculous. Unless you encounter some low-level bandit, you're almost garanteed to wipe at least once before you can manage the enemies you encounter. I get it that encounters need to offer some challenge but in this case, it's like the devs don't even know how power scales in Pathfinder and they just designed encounters that even a well-rounded party of six will have to spend half their ressources on. Is it normal that nearly half my party die after using half their spells to survive a fight with a few giant spiders or a handful of bandits? No, it's not, not unless said enemies were of a much higher level.

I can respect trying to make it authentic by using Pathfinder's ruleset but some mechanics don't translate well to video games, like the Use Magic Device skill. It's fine to have to try again while in combat, it adds tension and makes sense but out of combat, when you have all the time in the world and no pressure, using a scroll should always work on the first try. And then you have stuff like initiative, even if you'Re scouting with a stealthy character, as soon as you initiate combat, initiative is rolled normally. No surprise round, no ambush, no nothing, the ambushed enemies might still move before some of your party members can.

But I can't stress enough how bad the combat encounters are, even at normal difficulty, they seem so unfair. Some of these scripted encounters, I swear you can't survive them unless you're much, much higher level than the encounter mechanically requires, simply because the devs couldn't be bothered to know their shit before making a Pathfinder video game.

Just stick to the classic Baldur's Gate games. Even Icewind Dale is a lot more enjoyable than this. I'll stick to the tabletop game, because at least you can kick the DM out if he sucks.",1631365751,1631365751,False,20,3,0.56545644998550415,0,True,False,False

For everybody else, honestly, you're not missing out much. Hear me out. It's a faithful adaptation of the Pathfinder rules and adventure module. Playing it however, feels like playing with a grognard, childish DM (dungeon master) with English as their third language.

[b]Story[/b]

It's bad. That's not an exaggeration. You start off as an adventurer stumbling into nobility status, given a kingdom to run, and spend the rest of the game running around the map solving problems. Every now and then you get attacked by magical monsters, and as an overarching plot you're trying to figure out why and how these are all connected. On one hand, it's a nice setup; on the other hand, the execution involves you reading through tons of utterly forgettable writing that serves as nothing more as info dumps, written by somebody in their native language and google translated to english.

Everything is predictable, and there's nothing more to it. You see every betrayal from a mile away, except for one specific party member which I won't spoil. That one was pretty good, the setup was the only clever thing in the game.

[b]Worldbuilding[/b]

You think Pillars of Eternity had a ton of lore dump? Well, welcome to Pathfinder. You'll get no less than 50 nouns, of which only 2 or 3 play an actual active role in the game. It's not that there's too much reading to do, it's that all these reading have absolutely no impact in the game world. They're inconsequential.

That said, you DO get a massive variety of monsters to murder. That's great; too many RPGs shy away from enemy varieties. In this game, you get to use a wide range of tools as different enemies often require completely different counters. Combat is pretty easy once you understand how the system works, which is a great thing in this game.

[b]Gameplay & Kingdom management[/b]

What can I say? A good RPG has many subsystems, and this game has a whole metric fuckton of them. Choose-your-own-adventure sections? Check. Realtime with pause combat? Check. Turn based combat? Check. Companion quests? Check. Romance? LOL (there's... practically none) ok fine check. Kingdom management? Check. There's so many systems going on and you need to learn, that if you're into this kind of complexity, you'd enjoy it, IN SPITE of the shit writing.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]

Here's what I think about this game. The developers, Owlcat, are earnest devs, and this is a great debut. But they are inexperienced. This game does NOT respect your time. Everything in this game is almost as if they were designed specifically to waste your time.

I've put about 100 hours into this game, and 50 hours of it (no I'm not exaggerating) are non-player activities. Here's a laundry list:

* The main menu has an animation that takes about 10 seconds to finish. Sure, you can click on the menu items before it finishes playing, but the animation itself is unskippable.
* EVERY single cutscene (there are close to 30+ I think) are unskippable. Worse if you need to reload the game; enjoy suffering through the unskippable cutscenes.
* Kingdom events have their animation of advisors walking up and doing a bow before talking. It's a mere 2-3 second thing, but you get literal hundreds of events through the course of play. They add up.
* Walking from point A to point B is slow. It speeds up if the distance is far, but if the distance is too far, suddenly the speeding up doesn't work.
* Overmap travel is SLOW as fuck, even with teleporting circles (aka fast travel). 
* Companions will interact with each other (2 dialogue bubbles) every time you rest. You can skip this (thank god), but it's annoying and then entire rest mechanics take about 10 seconds to complete.
* Bad pathfinding and cramped dungeons means you often take twice or 3 times the time to get from one end to the other.

All in all, this game LOVES to waste your time. Not only that; there are many, many ways you can gimp your game session, by making the wrong choices, and these choices aren't really telegraphed at any time. Try to play a Lawful Good character? Hah no, all your choices are Lawful Stupid. Try to play Chaotic Evil? Hah no, your game ends in the second act because you decided to roleplay a dick, which isn't supported in the game. Try to make a sensible decision for the long term gain of the kingdom? Here, it's Lawful Evil.

Sigh, I guess I'm done here. I can't bring myself to finish the game; it's just too exhausting to play. If you want to play this game, mod the fuck out of it. The developers have a LONG way to go to learn how to make a good game, and stop creating so many mechanics to waste the player's time.

-a lot of content

-a lot of customization in terms of classes and skills

-Spell visuals look nice

Cons:
-Inconsistent difficulty. 1 fight you're stomping and another you're getting stomped even if you're in the proper zone. 

-Having to google mechanics and how to progress the story, because the game does a poor job explaining it ingame (or at all.)

-Bugs and wrong spell/ability descriptions. Why bother having such a complex system just for it to not work properly? eg. crane wing you're supposed to have 1 hand empty, but it works just fine 2 handed.

-Mostly boring companions with dull dialogue and on top of that it has little to no voice acting. 

-Too slow pacing with too many load screens. I have an SSD and it's still a massive slog to do anything in this game. Move a bit-> fatigue-> rest-> move a bit-> fatigue-> rest. Kingdom management is even a bigger chore with it's infinite amounts of load screens.

-I enjoy roleplaying (don't know why else you would try to play this game,) but it's just impossible with this many immersion breaking things. For example the alignment dialogues 9 out of 10 times make no sense at all. A kobold casting a spell has the same voice as a human or an orc.

Game with tons of unpolished content which after many years of patches still isn't worth my time.

A 'very good' Pathfinder game. This REALLY scratched my tabletop itch!

It is not without it's faults; some Feats do not work like they should, Flanking is generous, the UI is not as friendly as it could be, the 'Kingmaker' part is poorly explained, and (thus far) 'normal' difficulty is pretty easy (this could be for a variety of reasons for me. For example, I like the turn based option).

But the story is good, and it is a fun 'port' (is that applicable here?!) from the table top!

*A not so negative review after 70 more hours into the game.

I wasn't being complete mature about a game being terrible at explaining things, but it sucks way more when you lose because sometimes this game goes out of its way to NOT explain things to you. Case and point in the first 10 hours of the game you can easily make decisions that block you out of 2-3 of your companions at once with no warning/clue/notification. I found out about this when I remade a character and had to spend even more time figuring out the right order to complete said quests.

If you are new to this and willing to spend the first 20-ish hours learning how the pathfinder system works and put up with some BS rng, please play this game. I feel like there is a lot of content that locked behind poor UI and tutorial decisions and you would be robbing yourself out of what is a good game with some flaws seen in the beginning. I've heard the last few fights of the game are just of their way terrible as well but until then I think I'll keep playing

**original review - take it with a grain of salt (maybe a truckload)

This is a game for people with no friends to play DnD with. Character creation is poorly explained, stats are poorly explained, abilities are poorly explained. Unless you're one of the nerds that circle jerk at the subreddit or some geriatric boomer that some how lived long enough from the dark ages to touch this game, avoid it like that plague. There is nothing fun about a game as inaccessible as this one. Anyone that claims that ""its your type of game"" is welcome to polish my bowling balls.

The combat is centred around a Die Roll, which is what I see most of the complaints come for this game. But the real issue is how dmg is calculated and dealt based on the enemy Armor Rating. 
Some real ""special"" people must have been on payroll to design 50 percent of the enemies to be impervious to physical damage. Oh you wanted to play a warrior? No, here take this wizard and bounce on his wand for a hundred hours. Are there any alternatives? Sure!  Just waste hundreds of gold to achieve the same effect and pray the dice roll doesn't completely sabotage you :). Also have fun with a overburdened system that inhibits your ability to farm loot for money to not starve to death in game.

I'm sure that given enough time I will be able to comprehend the workings of a mentally challenged developer's take on fun. And when I do I would be delighted to be putting all that time and effort to also face more characters that take no damage from anything. If anyone had fun with this game, please check yourself in a hospital and consider therapy. No one should suffer this crap shoot piece of kickstarter trash

When i first started i'm not even sure there was a turn-based mode and without it the game was a torture, really. It also was a ""MISS!"" simulator untill i've googled proper character builds. But that fixed itself in late game when i was able to build an adequate character without any guides...

The game is good. I'm skipping all pros, you can assume that everything not listed in cons is fine.
And as for cons, well, there's a bunch:
1) Optimisation is poor. Especially late-game and your capital. It lags for no reason, ~40FPS 3080 2160P in capital and 10-20 FPS on the last map.
2) Late game is very hard. It's practically sadism. Both kingdom management and combat difficulty spikes through the roof. You're getting hordes of powerful enemies out of nowhere. It's a visible contrast with the all the previous chapters where i was considering upping the difficluty. It's not fun. It's a grind and constant save-load.
3) Timed campaign didn't bother me but it can bother you. There are mods to stop the timers, tho (check the end of the review).
4) I don't think you can get a good ending for all of your characters on the first run, unless you google. It's not exactly obvious that some characters are even ABLE to do a 180 turn of themselves (semi-spoiler: it's a character opposing Tristan at the end of the game). And getting true ending... would be a miracle.
5) It's hard. If you're in for a ""common"" RPG like Dragon Age or Divinity, you're in for a surprise: i'm not sure you'll like it. Combat randomness is somewhere near XCOM with it's famous ""95% hit"" misses. And if you don't know what you're doing most of your combat actions will be misses. It's a strange sight to observe 2 characters missing each other for a minute straight.

But the ending is interesting, choices matter, graphics are fine, violence is there... It's good. But prepare to suffer. And if you don't want to, there's a mod i'd recommend to skip all the OP enemies at the end: Bag Of Tricks allows you to kill them at any time.",1631141436,1631141436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway, the combats are disapointing, my hero is so weak, he just sits behind and miss his attacks while Amiri carries. 
the 1 spell per day thing is completly game breaking in the sense that its not fun at all. you got 1 fireball then better go back to nap time. ridiculous.
I dont know if Linzi is a mandatory character but im getting rid of her asap. very very annoying voice and attitude. 
Would be nice if there was voice acting for every dialog, not just the important one. consider maybe a narative voice.
Also, we should not have to scroll down the option menu to swap from turn per turn to in real time.
Other than that its a good game.

I will now revise my review. i found out a key bind to toogle the turn per turn wich is really good.
however, the miss fest has gone worst and worst. the paladin cannot hit anything. on 15 blow she missed 15, no joke.
Also, this aint really a classic RPG, i have not once got a weapon or armor upgrade, all i got was 3-4 rings, 2 amulets and a chest armor for my main character. all crap loot to be vendored. And when i level, i dont always get to add stats (like str,dex,cons) to my characters. 
I tried fighting the stag lord (on easy difficulty) but i couldnt hit for S. and his named NPCs started to triple strike my characters somehow at some point, i dont know.

For the price per hour and quality this is a strong recommend to buy. I clocked in at 160 hours in one play through, and while not completing everything (mostly some fairly strong time gated enemies). I did clear out the bulk of the main game and expansion content. 

The game is a mix of board travel, small quest encounters, larger dungeon exploration, and kingdom management. The beginning of the game blends this quite well to keep things fresh. However.....towards the end I did feel like the game turned into a lot of kingdom management only, however I suspect this is due to me clearing out most of the board quicker than expected. 

The quests are fun and varied and the zones are beautiful and diverse, same with the enemies. Combat is challenging without being too difficult. A few fights stumped me but taking a step back and thinking about it proper prep and levelling always solved any concerns. I do wish for a few more longer dungeon's however the expansion did add a mega dungeon, however it was a little basic (not in terms of the difficultly but just lacked flair for a expansion piece).

The main story is average, it keeps you engaged but is not ground breaking. Your party options are endless though, whether its the generated characters or making your own party this game is 10/10 in options for this. Never have I seen so much ability to customise a party and is a strong point to Pathfinder:King Maker.

My Final score for this game is a 8/10. The game play is solid, graphics above average, char creation excellent, quantity of content excellent. Points lost for a meh story and some pacing issued between the adventuring, kingdom management and dungeon crawling. 

I know Owlcat just released a new Pathfinder which I have purchased. I am really hoping a few small changes and focus on story can push them over the top of an eight.

Steam refuses to give me a refund on this game despite that fact that I had 4.3 hours play on the free weekend and then only about 1 hour of play time after purchase. This game sets a false premise in which the tutorial is pretty easy; note i was playing on the ""normal"" difficulty. It isn't until after you make it to the normal game play sequence that you encounter a steep learning curve.

The game has many mechanics involving resource management, character fatigue management and status debuff management, The game barely tries to explain anything to you and expects you to know. So what do you get? You just end up dying is pretty much or backtracking alot. What should be the start of your adventure in this game feels like a chore and painstakingly slow beginnings. The game has a pacing issue. Combat in this game is unbearably unfair as it is ""dice roll based"" and you end up missing hits 9/10 times.

I will not open up a thick guide in order to play this game. This game failed  to be a game of the video game format if a player can't just jump right in.

There are quests with hidden timers, construction of settlements and settlement buildings is not well explained, kingdom progression is not well explained, you don't get enough advisors to deal with kingdom events nowhere near enough...

As a pnp player of DnD 3.5/5e and others tabletop rpg i was  immediately attracted to Kingmaker. I have played my share of this game, sadly only to act 4 before i lost interest. I like this game and i have lot of respect for Owlcat, you can tell the insane amount of effort and love they put in it.
This game is vast, an enormous map to explore and random encounters to keep on your toes.  This also applies to the story itself by starting as a nobody to ruling your own kingdom.
For those not familiar with Pathfinder rules, the first ten/twenty hours will be really challenging. The main cause being the unapologetic way the game will use its most punishing features to kick your ass, for example: damage to attributes, enemy with damage immunities, higher level monsters in the early areas, overkill traps (enjoy losing a companion for the rest of the game, minus savescumming). On the other hand the game will explain very little on how to build your main character and his companions. 
I like challenging games as Kingmaker, but once you know how to build your party and the roles you need to cover, it will quickly become very repetitive (even more so if you use the turn-based combat).
The real deal breaker for me is the alignments choices and the companions them self. 
DnD/Pathfinder alignments choices in the game are sometimes spot on, more frequently are okaish and a few time make no fucking sense (why it is Lawful G to try healing a wounded dwarf and it is Chaotic G to put him out of his misery, i don't really know). Alignment restricted classes are okay, but they could have given a little more leash then the original rules, to put it into perspective: i'm fine with the monk being only a Lawful character class or a Barbarian being only a Chaotic character class, but fuck the paladin for being a Lawful Good character class. 
The companions for me are a mixed bag, some i like and some i hate. I can care for Linzi the puppy/bard, i would love to slap Regongar for being a little b*tch.  You can get a big information dump about them as you recruit them, but it can easly take thirty hours before you have some new option when you talk with them. They have their related side quest, where they have some time to shine, unfortunately this quests are few and far in between the main campaign.  
I've lost interest in the fate of my companions and the fate of the barony, i don't know if i will pick up Kingmaker to finish it.

To sum it up, the reason i don't recommend Pathfinder: Kingmaker is that i find it too time consuming for what is offered.",1630876174,1630876174,False,3,0,0.494845390319824219,0,True,False,False

PROS

- Difficulty: What for some is a negative point, for many (like me) is the icing on the cake that has been missing for years for fans of the genre. At difficulty levels above Normal (Challenging and Hard, because Unfair is for crazy people haha), the game is really challenging to the point of making you think of specific strategies in most combats in the beginning and middle of the campaign.
- Combat modes: The game is originally RTWP (Real Time With Pause), but by also incorporating the Turn-Based Combat option, the game has an added level of complexity. In fact, you can switch between modes IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT, something totally innovative in the genre.
- Character Creation: The game has one of the most interesting character creations among all CRPGs ever created. No wonder it takes at least 2 hours to create your hero, due to the variety of classes (and subclasses) available, prestige classes, multiclass.
- NPCs and Companions: In addition to being interesting, the secondary characters have an impact on the story and a real connection with your hero. They´re meaningful.
- Writing: One of the strengths of the game (despite the exaggerated amount of text), you feel inclined to read everything without skipping a single sentence.
- Camping System: The best ever created in a game of its kind. Unique and attractive. Very good indeed!
- Map: The purpose of the map is to simulate a board game, which was very well executed and gives an extra immersion in the game.
- Soundtrack: Simply wonderful in every way! Mainly in combats with bosses. Perhaps the only caveat is that it's a bit repetitive in normal encounters.
- Menu Options: You can change every detail of the game to your personal preference.
- Graphics: Considering the isometric format, it meets expectations and has very nice particle effects.
- Side Quests: Sometimes more intriguing than some in the main campaign, you really feel like doing them all.
- Campaign duration: I have 260 hours played at the end of the game. I do not need to say anything more. haha

CONS

- Balancing: Despite the game's difficulty being one of the positive points, at the same time it is unbalanced mainly at the beginning of the campaign.
- Level progression: I know the game is based on pen&paper RPG rules, but it's still a little frustrating to have some levels where your character gains practically nothing but hit points, skill and feats. 
- Game Pace: If the player doesn't have the patience to spend the first 20 hours of gameplay slowly and hard, he may miss the best that Kingmaker has to offer, which starts right after the Chapter 1/2 and continues throughout the middle/end of the game.
- Bugs: The game actually received several patches over the years fixing various problems, but still in the current version has bugs that come to bother.
- Loading Screens: I had to remove the Auto-Save option because the loading screen was constant, sometimes time consuming and that hinders the fluidity of the player's experience.
- Kingdom Management: The idea is very good, but although the situations presented in text are interesting, the system itself is not well implemented and has several mechanical flaws.
- Crafting: Just like the item mentioned above, it could have been much better.
- UI: On the one hand, the interface is nice in menus and inventory, but it is not intuitive and sometimes presents unnecessary information without giving the option to show or not. Mainly in terms of skills / spells that could be more organized.
- Choices in Dialogs: In some moments, the available choices don't have results that make much sense and several options of impact in the game were taken out of context without having connection with what is being presented. This happens mainly in the choice of romance between characters and also in the possible endings of the game.
- Final Chapter: Honestly, I had fun in all the chapters of the game, except the last one, because it seemed “rushed” and incomplete, including some parts of the map you just walked around and had no area to explore.
- House at the Edge of Time: xD.

CONCLUSION

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is an excellent CRPG with unique and innovative elements. Despite some flaws that, as far as I could check, were fixed in the sequel (Wrath of the Righteous). It is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of the genre and who seeks depth with a challenging campaign. Definitely not for everyone.

I'll give it an 8/10, even considering the best pen&paper RPG adaptation I've ever played, as you can't ignore the game's technical problems.

Following the update 2.0 implemented in August 2020, the game is now incompatible with the Logitech G110 keyboard. A year after my initial forum post (now September 2021) asking for a solution, the bug is still not resolved. I have switched my review from positive to negative as I can't play this game I payed for.
///EDIT END///

This game is meant for previous Pathfinder Tabletop RPG players. There is very little information about how to play and could easily be overwhelming for a newcomer.

This being said, IF you played D&D or Pathfinder in the past, this game is excellent. It's great to explore the ""pre-made"" setting of Golarion at one's leisure. The Dungeon exploration feels satisfying and many fights are challenging: you need to plan and use tactics for those. I love all the NPCs and their interaction. Somehow, their banter makers them alive not unlike the characters of FFXV if you played that.

This being said, I think there is room for improvement. I feel like the main mechanic one has to balance during a fight is to make sure that your tank is attacked. That will either grant you easy victory or you will get TPKed. Additionally, I feel like the Kingdom building side of thing is a bit inconsequential. I think I'm near the mid-point of the game and my barony still looks like its low-level start. Maybe I don't understand Kingdom building, which would be an issue in itself too.

In short, if you know what you are expecting and still are interested, I recommend the game. It's a good experience despite its flaws.",1588087986,1630803720,False,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I feel that this game has a nice balance between leaning towards a Pillars of Eternity/Baldurs Gate style game vs something like Divinity or BG3 would. My biggest fear before playing was that the turned based system would be kinda shoved into the game and not feel very fluid. I was extremely wrong and happy to find that it works very well. I prefer to play this way over the real time play style since I'm more used to it and I entered the CRPG game genre fairly recently. Also good to know that the level of customization with almost everything is cranked up to 10. Whether its picking a class, deciding what settings to play my game at, or even how I want to play my character, you'll be spending a good amount of time on just messing around with the customization and I love that in games. If you just want to quickly choose a character and run with it as fast as possible, you can do that too. Even at the easier levels of the game, there is a healthy amount of difficulty. I altered the game at normal difficulty and added some stuff to make it a bit easier (slightly easier enemies, harder for my main character to die (fully), etc. This game has helped cement my love for CRPGs and while its not my favorite by any means, its exactly what I needed to hold me over until Baldurs Gate 3 fully releases.

Remember good ol' Owlbears? CR4 with a to hit of +8. Well get ready for Owlbears on crack, steroids and probably sporting an infinity gauntlet or two. After every modifier is added in with one modifier being +10 from str, which means the Owlbear is currently sitting at between 30-31 str, an Ancient Black Dragon clocks in at 33 STR. What deranged minds designed this?

Instead of dealing roughly 7 dmg per claw this badboy chucks out a minimum of 19 dmg per claw and bite if it rolls a natural 1 on dmg. Seeing as I was never able to kill the God of Owlbear-kind I can only speculate regarding its HP pool, but it is well over 90 hp. If they tweak the numbers I would have very little against this title, but the fact that it shipped in this condition is a red flag, and I will be wary of Owlcat Games in the future.


Review pt.2

After a few patches and some QoL changes the game has become much more enjoyable, though there are still some early encounters that makes me question my sanity. All in all: Pathfinder Kingmaker is a gem occupying a genre that seems difficult to pull off nowadays as many powerful IPs fail to deliver, most notably the new Planescape Torment. 

This game will give you a CRPG experience that very few modern CRPGs even come close to. Great companions and party dynamics, tight character creation, amazing story and full of times where your parties out of combat skills are applicable. Having skills such as Knowledge Religion give you more Lore and useful information from an old  fresque is something that makes the characters more than just their Attack Bonus and AC.",1538180208,1630592867,True,0,0,0.503127694129943848,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] [u]Adheres closely to the rules found in the tabletop RPG[/u] - It's impressive how closely this game follows the original rules of Pathfinder. A player familiar with the rules set would have little to complain about regarding its translation to a digital medium. Though for a newcomer like myself, the amount of information is absolutely daunting. The in-game tutorials are egregiously shallow compared to the depth of knowledge needed to make sensible decisions. I personally liked reading through some of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook to learn the systems but not everyone will feel the same. It was enjoyable to see the all rules at work, even though it felt like they were working against me most of the time.
[*] [u]Character customization[/u] - Kingmaker features a large selection of classes, subclasses, and prestige classes, along with a bevy of feats to customize characters. Trying out new characters is always fun, whether it's an original build or one of the many overpowered builds found online. The game includes a handy respec feature which allows the player to recreate their character from the first level in case they are no longer satisfied with their current setup.
[*] [u]Beneath the Stolen Lands[/u] - This DLC is a roguelike dungeon crawler with randomized maps and enemies. Characters level up much quicker, allowing the player to experiment with builds and team compositions at a faster pace than the main campaign. Especially with the ""Last Azlanti"" difficulty setting on, the intensity of each encounter was exciting. I never got too far through the dungeon but it was still fun.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] [u]Story[/u] - With the title like ""Kingmaker"", one would expect a tale of political intrigue, subterfuge, and heroic conquest. In actuality, it's a much less interesting story about some ornery fae with a confusing motivation to destroy the player character's kingdom. Each disparate chapter is poorly stitched together with awkwardly paced quests, making it difficult to follow the narrative. Worst of all, I never felt like a king. Instead, most quests made me feel like an errand boy and kingdom management made me feel like a secretary.
[*] [u]Kingdom management[/u] - Honestly, I would have rather played one of those awful dime-a-dozen kingdom building mobile games than what was implemented here. There is nothing fun or interesting about the kingdom management system. Success is mostly dependent on dice rolls; future events are not telegraphed well, causing your kingdom to falter unexpectedly; solving problems and developing cities both require the same resource (BP) which is accrued at snail's pace. Above all, it is never satisfying. The monumental chore that is kingdom management is paired with meager rewards, the best of which are distributed at random. 
[*] [u]Encounter design[/u] - The question I often asked myself while reloading a save for the umpteenth time was not ""how do I overcome this obstacle?"" but simply, ""why?"". Why does this creature have magical concealment for no meaningful reason? Why did dozens enemies just spawn in the middle of combat? Why wont this dungeon just end already? Many encounters are unbalanced, overlong, and as a result, often immersion-breaking.
[*] [u]Technical issues[/u] - Loading in and out of an area was excruciating, notably so towards the end of the game. Additionally, the graphics are not impressive enough to warrant the occasionally size-able dips in framerate.  My hardware is far from top-of-the-line but it should be more than enough to handle a game like this.

Kingmaker is a good game overall, mainly due to the complex and well-implemented battle system. I would recommend it to those looking for challenging tactical combat but not to those looking for a decent story. This may not be the best CRPG but it is a great foundation for future installments.

This could be a positive or a negative. I've thoroughly enjoyed this game but I am starting to get bored. However, I have invested so much time that I feel like I have to finish at this point. This game is also very challenging when you start out but becomes super easy if you main a sorcerer like I have. 

I like the kingdom management overall but towards the end it becomes very hard to find time to do it (time passing in game can cause you fail missions so you have to manage that as well as everything else) and some of the checks become insanely high. You have to build most of your characters to be able to preform well in combat and court. This often takes stats out of a desired place, like STR for a fighter, and forces you to invest into something like CHR that you would traditionally dump. This does somewhat prevent min/maxing, at least on a few characters, which is okay imo. I've never been a fan of min/maxing. The insanely powerful progression and gear often found in Pathfinder more than makes up for it anyways.

The story and most of the companion stories have been good. NPCs will remember every choice you or your companions have made (or that you forced them to make.) You can also lose or handy-cap companions as well based on the choices you make. All of this I found very enjoyable. I like to RP and live with consequences. However, permanently losing a character who's advisory role I had no one to replace with did force me to reload a save. You can hire mercenaries but they suffer a penalty to governing that makes them basically unusable as advisers.

Speaking of reloading saves... Keep A LOT of save games. You can very easily stumble into a fight you can not win, especially at lower levels and running away is usually very hard.

I recommend this game only if:
You have plenty of time to play it.
Have at least a basic understanding of Pathfinder.
Don't mind the occasional save scumming.

I DON'T recommend this game if:
You value your time.
You want a ""mainstream"" RPG or Tactics game, like Final Fantasy or Fire Emblem.

If you KNOW this is for you, you love D&D (Pathfinder), and want a video game fairly faithful to the source material, I recommend it. 

If you are doubtful at all I recommend finding something else or waiting for the full release of Baldur's Gate 3.

Fantastic all around. Intrigue, mystery, politics, and more are interwoven into side quests and the main quest alike. The Lore is rich, deep, and complex and can send you down a rabbit hole looking for little bits of information you never thought you would have cared about. Characters are real and have their own ideals, boundaries, and faults and help shape your character as much as you shape them. 

Gameplay:
The gameplay has lots of nuances that make playing the game the best way hard to grasp and fun to learn. The difficulty can jump without much warning, although for those that like a challenge this game has it and lots of class customization and items to create different and meaningful builds. Tbh I play for the story mostly myself.

Graphics:
The art and little details that go into making your kingdom your own are gorgeous. 

Music:
Great soundtracks that really fit the tone of whatever situation you may find yourself in, although the music tends to fade into the background after long sessions for me.

I would say 2/3 of time is wasted on watching the slow-pace animation of traveling and walking literally like waiting snails climb from A to B, and NO fast traveling or fast mode. Don't even mentioning the part your whole team exhausted after watching a slow traveling every 3-5 minutes and have to get rest or get extra slow movement (some clarification: JUST traveling, no story, no fight, no anything intervene). Besides, your character's build is grid although there seems are many combinations of skills in game, cause if u have the ""WRONG"" combination of classes, skills, and attributes, your character can literally never accomplish a single hit; that's right, a SINGLE HIT, after the first tutorial scene, in NORMAL difficulty. The level design is terrible; your enemies are either too godly or pity for your team, and cost you relentlessly your time on SL. The you and ur teammates interactions are very LIMITED and plain, just squad up to fight and several background explanation conversation, no friendship nor romance if u expected.  I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but definitely not a game I expected. (Might change this review after later experience.) //{10 hours}

Do you remember Demogorgon, from the bottom of Watcher's Keep in Baldur's Gate 2? An optional, big 'ol F*** you critter, which was THE toughest fight throughout the Baldur's Gate series, hell any of the Infinity Engine games. Picture that amount of tailoring builds, gear, buffs, etc... for the last chapter of the game. On normal difficulty. With groups of enemies with gaze attacks that they use every round with a decent chance of rendering members of your party paralyzed or feared.

While I don't mind looking at different builds to see what kinds of synergies there are out there especially to a rule set that I'm not completely familiar with, to see what may or may not work, I don't want to spend my gaming time pouring over spreadsheets or looking at wikis. I have to give the developers credit for being able to change the difficulty settings on the fly, because after 130 hours in, when I hit that difficulty cliff at the end and spent a few hours trying to feel my way around The House at the End of Time I said f*** this bullshit and dropped it down to story mode so I could just go through the motions to finish the game. I was done. The endless slog broke me. The kingdom management stuff was largely just busywork and the one aspect of it I was actually interested in for gameplay reasons, the artisans and the high-end masterwork gear they can produce, bugged out. So doing their quests and passing an inordinate amount of time in game did nothing but waste my time.

And the kingdom management system is nothing but a time-sink. And a money sink as well, since you'll be swimming in gold later on with little to spend it on due to the limited number of merchants and the fact that few of them restock their goods. Again, if you like watching numbers go up and getting minor buffs, you do you. I found it tedious and a distraction from exploring the fascinating world of the game.

Although, again, to be fair the only bugs I encountered ingame aside from one or two lockups were a handful of optional quests not properly triggering, most of which were related to kingdom events and artisan crafters. Whatever issues there may have been at launch the majority of the most egregious bugs have been quashed at this point.

Up until the endgame I would have recommended the game, despite the flaws in the kingdom management side of things since it can also be entirely automated in the difficulty settings. Prior to The House at the End of Time the only other occasion where I dropped the difficulty down to lolfaceroll was at the bottom of the Tenebrous Depths, a Dungeon akin to Watcher's Keep with another ridiculous enemy at the bottom. After at least two hours of unsuccessful attempts on the boss there with a level 17 party I was fed up and just wanted to move on. I dropped the difficulty on that fight to wrap things up and move on with the main story and switched everything back to normal until near the end.

Sadly, like the final season of Game of Thrones tarnishing the preceding ones, the last act of the game poisoned my view of everything that came before it. Unlike some other games like Tyranny or Age of Decadence where where choices you make can drastically alter your playthrough, the choices you have in Pathfinder: Kingmaker only have a major impact in the final few hours of the game at most, or the ending slideshow. And if you didn't get the 'good' ending for your companions? Good luck. Throw in the absurd difficulty spike and I don't see any replay value in the game, aside from being a masochist and trying for higher difficulties or a different build. Again, I wasn't the least bit undergeared or leveled either, being a completionist I was level 19 (of max 20) when I entered the endgame and it was still a miserable experience. F*** Wild Hunt mobs. Every last one of the mother****ers. And uh... yeah. Be prepared for the possibility of losing party members based on choices you made 80+ hours earlier.

The first 120ish hours I fully recommend. The last 20-30. F*** it. Be prepared to buckle down and prepare for the slog, to drop the difficulty, or just drop the game entirely.

*EDIT*

It wasn't a bad game, if anything it was an amazing first game from a new developer and I will play the sequel (a year or so after release so the DLC and bugfixes can be sorted out). It's very ambitious and while it generally does well, there are some glaring flaws to it. I'd rather give it a ""Maybe"" or a ""Yes, but..."" instead of a thumbs down if there was the option.

My issue was the last stretch was so jarring, so out of step with the preceding 80% of the game it killed all of the momentum it was building on. If it was an optional dungeon I wouldn't have been as annoyed because I could skip the fights, but it's the main story. If you want to progress you have to figure out a way forward. Dropping the difficulty felt like it cheapened the experience, even if it was the path of least resistance forwards. But difficulty was only one aspect of the frustration: what happens with your companions is pretty infuriating too if you weren't aware of how to get the 'proper' endings for them. [spoiler]Losing a key party member without having any say in the matter whatsoever[/spoiler] was the salt in the wound, even if you did everything else 'right'. After spending the previous month or so playing and getting engaged with the story I wanted to see how all the stories wrapped up.

That, and I felt cheated for all the effort I put into kingdom management for it to really amount to nothing in the end. You participate in the kingdom management to increase stats... to make the kingdom management easier. It's a circular loop that isn't building towards anything other than Achievements for the completionists out there.",1628056683,1630364287,False,159,6,0.709623336791992188,8,True,False,False

In short - after 170 hours and completeting some of the rarest achievemnts I have to say I like the game. I almost love it. But - and i really want to stress this out - i used some mods that fixed some really annoying things for me (like kingdom management). If you really in love with classic RPGs, and you want some complex and interesting story, and you do not mind tearing some of your hair out due to some bad design or  terrible roll luck - this game will possess you for some time. I basically beat it twice, made it to last chapter with my first party then started over again. Second time I basically knew everything i wanted to know, from my first playthrough or guides. It made the game much easier. 

Old review:

Hear me out. Do not, I tell you, do not invest your time into this. This game is absolutely flawed, you will regret times and times you dragged yourself into it. Dont get me wrong - while it has some amazingly designed moments it is deeply flawed to the point you will be tempted to drop the game after almost 100 hours into it (read the forums, do not realy on my word for it). Search ""wild gaze bullshit"" for example.
And dont get me wrong - game is flawed not because its hard, the way you learn how to overcome the difficulties. It is hard the way you reaload your quicksave 10-15 times just to fish for a lucky die roll. I really tried to love this game, i spent a lot of time playing it, and I have up in the end.

Major problems:
 Failure to progress the main storyline will result in a game over;  the requirements to do so often switch between ""adventure"" and ""Kingdom management"" modes without explaination or indication. The only hint is that your kingdom begins to crumble.  Then you just lose.  The end. 
 Several of the dungeons are utterly incomprehensible;  I could not complete the final one, even using multiple walkthroughs and guides.
Minor problems:
 Combat interface is clunky.  Not unforgivably so, but it makes playing casters not much fun, which is a problem since tough combats are best addressed by stacking buffs, which takes forever.
 Monsters are often arbitrarily given huge hp and damage, which is confusing if you are used to the pen and paper game
 Load screen are long and absurdly frequent:  switching from kindgom management to adventuring mode requires crossing two maps and and waiting through four load screens, for basically no reason other than to waste time.
The whole kingdom management system is kind of a confusing mess

The encounter design is based on the presumption that you know the game and the mechanics on an advanced level. You need to actually read the books. If you don't play Pathfinder (like me), you'll be completely lost. You'll end up being murdered over and over and not even know why, or what is happening. That, or you'll just stand around and watch your party miss an enemy over and over until you get crit-nuked to death out of nowhere. 

You can lower the difficulty, but that just made me feel bad. Especially when some encounters, even on the lowest difficulty, have inherent mechanics that can still party wipe you. You are constantly bringing knives to gunfights, and changing the difficulty just feels like them having a smaller gun. But they still have the gun! The size of the gun was never the issue!

I can see why people love this. They invest so much time, and they're familiar with the world. I get it.

I'ma pretty avid rpg player from the original baldurs gate series to pillars of eternity, I've experienced a thing or two about these games. If your looking for class fantasy, its not here. The character customization looks like a wet dream at first, with so many classes and sub classes. However, if for example you don't ""Dip"" the correct classes when leveling up.(dip being put a level into) you severely handicap yourself. If you want to be a two handed sword wielder, your option is mad dog barbarian with dips across inquistor and ranger. Which makes absolutely no logical sense. and then near the end of your build you finally ""Dip"" into twohanded sword fighter. Some classes, if you purely level them up will result in a completely ineffective character. Despite having a CAPSTONE if you should choose to put all 20 levels into a class/subclass. SO I digress. You have two options. Either learn the pathfinder build discipline system, takes an average IQ person probably about 4-8hours of reading guides if you know nothing. Or play on story mode. I'm unfortuantly unable to pass the inteligence check to learn the pathfinder system in a way thats useful to me. So I got about 40 hours into story mode and the game gets pretty dry. I think the final nail in the coffin for me was armags tomb. The location will only show up if you pass a single roll perception check one try per level. This means you can get permanently locked out for a very long time. OF COMPLETELY THE MAIN STORY. I gave up. Let me be clear, Anyone a fan of D&D high fantasy who wants an extremely deep tactical turnbased swords and spells game, have at it. The game provides a serviceable setting for it. Don't expect to get fully invested in a story. Kingdom managment is a gimmic thats neat for about 5-10 hours. depending on whether you have played with similar systems before your mileage on the novelty of it may vary.

640820,96834601,76561198075981471,0,3,24963,0,20870,1691181527,"I am writing this review as a reaction to some of the current top reviews of this game. It saddens me that people may turn away from what I consider to be an exceptional experience because some people just weigh what is important in a game differently than you or I might. I will say that I never played the table top version or knew anything about this game or the Pathfinder system before this. The entire experience was brand new and fresh, but let’s get to it. 

Obviously, you can see right away that I giving this game a recommend, but in order for this to have any impact, let’s first make sure that we have similar gaming preferences. So, to give you a better idea of where I am coming from and decide if my opinion will be of any value, understand that while I don’t exclusively play RPGs, they are my primary gaming genre. I love them, I love the story focus, I love the relationship building, I love the adventure, the occasional romance,  but MOST of all, I love being given agency within the narrative and seeing the consequences of my decisions come to fruition somewhere in the game. You can surmise then, that I weight the story and roleplaying elements far more heavily than strong gameplay/combat. Enjoyable gameplay/combat to me, is just a bonus and it typically elevates an RPG to the next level. Some examples. Strong narrative/characters and strong gameplay/combat: Witcher 3. Strong narrative/characters but weak gameplay/combat: Dragon Age: Origins. Weak narrative/characters but strong gameplay/combat: Mass Effect: Andromeda.

Now keeping all of that in mind; This game now stands as one of my favorite RPGs of all time, so it is without hesitation that I am able to recommend this game to fans of role playing experiences. If you want a fun narrative, with endearing characters, solid RPG elements, astounding attention to detail, and you want to see your choices come to life in game, then this game is for you. GIVE ME THAT CROWN BOI. I once saw a group of random peasants looking for treasure and they asked me for directions, so I sent them in a random direction, because lulz Chaotic Neutral. Only to find them CHAPTERS later and have them tell me my directions worked and they are now rich. HAHA now that is what I am talking about. Now, I would be remiss not to mention the enormous amount of customization that you have as a player in terms of building your character. Tons and tons of classes (including archetypes) that allow you to build your character however you want. Awesome role playing possibilities. Love it. Want to be a ranger/bard/barbarian, do it, want to be some sort of duelist character, go for it, want to be a biting barbarian or a sword saint or a rogue that uses two flails? DO IT. This game is your canvas. 

Okay but a few caveats, because again while I love this game, it has weak elements to it, and just like any other game these need to be highlighted too. Here are the most jarring problems for me. The game is not balanced, I mean talk about getting absolutely MURDERED in every other encounter. Enemies are tough, way too tough, the later part of the game is filled with enemies that can paralyze you, instant kill you, and have beefed up stats more in line with someone who is max level instead of the more likely 17-19 level party you are going to be if you don’t grind. Skill checks for locks and perception checks can only be done ONCE per level. I mean wtf is this LOL. This means if you fail to open a lock ONCE you cannot try again with that character until you level up. Uh pass, my guy, I am not coming back to to this area just to open the one chest. Encumbrance in games is the absolute bane of my existence, yeah yeah hard core bro, I hear you. That is realistic. BUT IT IS NOT FUN. With the amount of level drains and stat drains that you are going to be hit with, you will be encumbered constantly. Geezus. There are also some very strange narrative choices where the agency is taken away from the player. How much these specific instances will bother someone will vary, but for me, given how excellent the narrative elements are for the majority of the game, these instances really stood out. One specific issue here is that some dialogue choices are locked behind alignment, like we are somehow unthinking beings that are unable to rationalize decisions. Even funnier is the fact that there are tons of OTHER dialogue options that are other alignments that YOU CAN select. Come on Owl bros, why do you hurt me like this? The moving around in the map, okay seriously makes me want to bury myself in soup cans. As your territory grows you are sent farther and farther from your capital and you move sooooooooo slow. End me. I have to get the one egg from that one mountain and it is going to literal real life minutes.  You can feel your body wasting away when this happens. Another thing, if you have never played Pathfinder like me. You will get overwhelmed. This system is not easy to understand and it baffles the mind how people play this outside of a video game. Ya’ll are a different breed. 300+ hours and I am far from mastery here. Lastly, I just want to quickly mention the Kingdom Management. I liked it, but really it is hit or miss. Automate it in the options if you hate it.

Okay I can hear you typing already. (Read this part in a funny accent) “ But my friend your negative paragraph is so much bigger than the positive paragraph, you said you loved this game”. 
Well yes you are right and yes I do love this game, so here is where the biggest caveats come in.
Thankfully our great masters at Owlcat Games were kind enough to give us difficulty customization, so if you think you can play on Normal, don’t, play on Easy. You think you can play on Hard? Don’t, play on Normal. Look, the fact is, unless you are a Pathfinder genius, this game is going to punish you, so don’t help it hurt you. Adjust the settings to whatever works for you and I promise things will be so much better. If you want to be a masochist then do it later (or don’t your choice :D). Okay now one more thing: I recommend this game be played with mods, specifically Visual Adjustments (which lets you customize your character and companions to look exactly how you want them to in game) and Bag of Tricks (which lets you adjust SO many aspects of the game that it almost makes many of the issues I mentioned before, moot, as you can just adjust them). And before I start hearing about how you shouldn’t review games based on mods, let me just say this: MALARKEY. Mods elevate a game, a strong modding community and good mods allow players to tailor the game to their preferences, which to me IS part of the core experience. The mere existence of mods that give you options to make the game better tailored for you, is absolutely worth considering when buying. So yeah, play with those mods, 80-90% of my gripes with the game were solved because of them. Annoying lock mechanic: FIXED, annoying dialogue alignment locks: FIXED, annoying encumbered issue: FIXED, some weird bug that has you permanently debuffed: FIXED, an item didn’t show up due to a bug for a quest: FIXED. I mean these are god sends and combined with an appropriate difficulty level will make your experience 100 times better. Trust me. 

Okay so let’s sum up because honestly kudos to you if you read this far and because steam is capping me out lol. The game is fun, but it is fun if you are looking for a specific experience. Yeah it is unbalanced, yeah some classes are better than others, yeah it can be very punishing, yeah it sometimes has weird unexplained mechanics, but ultimately if what you WANT is an RPG with story decisions, good characters, and the ability to role play how you want, then I promise you. Follow my suggestions and you will go on a journey that you won’t soon forget. Remember, this game is long, you don’t need to deal with things that aren’t fun, just fix them and enjoy the ride.

It's funny because while having a good system for it, I believe it's unnecessary. There's a lot of cards (events, curses, promotions) that just sits in a corner with a discord notification annoying the hell out of you and when you look you got 8 quests to send everyone away for weeks to months WHILE they are in your adventuring party. The kingdom/village building part is lackluster. What you build in your kingdom/village doesn't actually show up where you placed it (or at all), when you progress and get more land to build like 3x3 -> 4x4 some buildings are 2x1 but they don't rotate at all screwing your previous layout and having to rebuild everything to fit, last thing.. your playthrough can end abruptly because you kingdom has fallen to ??? (it doesn't tell you why when it falls) also it's not really important because you can turn it off and continue playing so really all of that is just a distraction from the quests and exploration. 

Combat is PF Combat. By The Numbers. Classes and feats are abundant for the ultimate min/max gimmick and magical items range from broad to niche. I have no problems since the more niche magical items are directed towards your companions. 

Enemies & Levels: This game is fucking weird about its enemy placement. What I mean is, one Point of Interest that might be quest related have enemies your level or under. Good combat ratings, and then there's another P.o.I. right next to you and it's +3 levels above or enemies that need a (d20) 10 to hit the next enemy is 18-20. These enemies are in the same region yet differ in levels and would have to come back at another time so you might just forget and ignore it.

I enjoy the story. A few of the characters I felt were 'eh' at first but they grew on me. 

The Bad:

Where do I start. This game is maddeningly frustrating to play. It is so riddled with bugs I flat out gave up after replaying multiple dungeons/quest-lines over again because some trigger didn't fire or I didn't do something in the order they want you to do it in. Further examples were my game cutscenes that happened outside [spoiler] while in your kingdom showed my capital as being a village no matter what level it was actually at [/spoiler] but went back to normal when the cutscene ended. When I clicked to attack a mob my party would go to it... but my own character would just wander around for a few rounds unless I selected JUST them and told them to attack. 

Kingdom management was very poorly documented. I had absolutely no idea how to build additional villages and didn't even realize you were SUPPOSED to until I had gotten pretty far along. Several of the 'features' in it apparently just don't work. No matter how many villages I actually had, the count was always 0. Appointing councilors and using them is so janky and weird that alone made me almost stop playing. Sometimes they will just auto-assign to a task but then wait for you to actually START the task. In the meantime since they are assigned, they don't show as being available so you have to go back through and find where they went. 

I could go on but just thinking about how much time I wasted on a game I ultimately got so frustrated with I had to drop it is... well... frustrating me.",1629944877,1629944877,False,4,0,0.508537590503692627,0,True,False,False

[b]1.[/b] personally i find the story and characters very good and gripping, while the choices you make through the game can be felt in your gameplay.

[b]2.[/b] the graphics are not insane or bad, but decent.

[b]3.[/b] the gameplay itself is pretty standard for this type of game, and offers a decent variety of races, classes, abilities and class archtypes.

[b]4.[/b] the stats sheet for your character are decently explained when hovering the mouse over the different types of stats.

[b]6.[/b]
the game length for me is prob. aprox. 100 hours, but i do like to take my time in games, and try to explore as much as i can... (if i see a shiny in a game, i'll get that shiny, even if it kills me! xD )

[b]5.[/b] now the biggest complain i've seen so far, are in regards to the games difficulty, which i dont get, since you can pretty much tailor the difficulty to your liking when starting up a game, of course if your hellbent on using the premade difficulties (just as in other games: easy, normal, hard etc..), it's pretty much your own fault if you find it too easy or hard... 
of course if its your first playthrough or first time trying this type of game, just try one of the standard settings through the tutorial area (before you get access to the map), and then if it's to hard or easy, start a new game where you have set your own custom settings for the parts you didn't like.

[b]a last comment:[/b] 
if you dont like the premade visuals for your characters, there exist a mod on nexus, that lets you customize this. the mod is pretty easy to install and use, and doesn't change the gameplay, but is purely visual.

The story was good(not great). You can play in real time with pause or turned based. Turned base was slower but much greater control.

It was clearly made for tabletop players as there is very little hand holding. I would of benefited greatly with additional information on the item abilities and an in game calendar.

Also there is a kingdom management card game baked into it. It was frustrating at times and I save scummed a lot when the RNG wasn't going my way.

Overall a great classic RPG in the style of Baulders gate that is lacking in convenience for new players to the system.

It's not the absolute most polished game, as it seems only certain parts of the game have voiced dialogue (mostly the main dramatic scenes and a few random others scattered around), and the dialogue can be a bit lazy and/or stilted and/or awkward at times. The game is also divided up to several small maps, the smaller ones in particular are quite repetitive in design. This was definitely a game made on a small budget, but it also has a ton of heart that more than makes up for these drawbacks. 

I have been playing the game non-stop for about a week now, I am definitely addicted to it. The quests are involved and feel meaningful, the outcomes of your various decisions do have a legitimate and meaningful impact on the game environment as well as the plot. Even the less important side quests can have big impacts. There are some fetch quests, but literally only two or three that I have discovered so far. For the most part, the quests stand out from one another and you do have a sense of achievement from completing them. 

The companions and even some of the less notable characters are also well-written, and you do get attached to them. Some characters are also written to be despised, and that is accomplished well (I can't fucking stand Jubilost, stupid gnome runs his fucking mouth too much). The companion quests are also not one-off side quests that you complete and then never revisit like in a Bioware game, they unfold over a few quests across and extended period which makes you feel even more involved.

The game is also looooong. I'm not sure how many ""chapters"" there are supposed to be after you become the Baron, but I'm on the third, and I have the feeling I am only about half way through the game even though it took me 50+ hours to get there. However, it still hasn't felt repetitive to me, and the writing is compelling enough to keep me wanting to see what happens next. EDIT: The game has 7 chapters which I was only able to beat after 370 hours of gameplay. Literally took weeks of all-day gaming. JFC.

All your friends have recommended this DM, and he's had to work very hard to get where he is, so you decide to hit this DM up, and ask to play a game with him.


The first thing you notice is that this DM has some really weird house rules. He's willing to allow everything in the core rulebook, and some of the stuff in a few of the older splatbooks, but also dosen't let you play a tiefling unless you buy him a soda first. Weird. But not a dealbreaker. He even lets you draw your own character portrait. 

You start the campaign, and it’s immediately apparent that the DM has inserted some of his homebrew plot into the middle of the prewritten adventure. Not a big deal, you think. Every DM puts their own spin on things. 

However, a few sessions in, around the time your hitting level 3, you start to notice a few...odd quirks that this DM has. The first was when he threw an enemy that was weak to cold iron without giving you an obvious Cold Iron weapon to deal with it. The second time was when he threw a super high level boss to ambush you outside a haunted campsite, with basically zero chance of your character able to defeat it. Or when the first real boss was up on a raise platform, with a huge bonus to hit, requiring half a dozen turns of _just movement_ by your armored dwarf to reach him.  Oh, and did I mention he shoots 3 times per round? 

Granted, it’s not all bad. The roleplaying aspect is great. And the DM even lets you adjust things like the amount of damage you take from monsters, or offering to reduce all the monsters ability scores by 4. This does somewhat level the playing field, but you still feel irked every time you end up fighting a monster with double or triple the amount of hitpoints your used too. Indeed, in the back of your mind, you begin thinking that this DM might be one of those DMs who just expects everyone to come into their game min maxed.

Once you realize that, you decide to restart the game, and roll up something that you, personally, consider overpowered. An elf wizard with 20 starting int and 8s across the board. Something that no same DM would ever accept. And yet? This DM does. And as you play through the campaign a second time? You find that the combat is a lot more fair. Shure, a DC 17 Fort save spell at level 1 shure seams overpowered to you. But not when all the enemies have +7 to their saves. 

And the more you play, the more you learn to accept this mindset.  And in the end, it ends up feeling less like a dnd campaign, and more like, a single player MMO disguised as a dnd game. Which isn’t a bad thing. But their’s definitely something lost in the transition.

Oh, and even with your overpowered character, the DM will still occasionally pull such bullshit as “entire party needs to make a DC 30 will save or else all your characters fall to the ground helpless”  When your character’s bonus to will save is like, +9. 

Apart from those hiccups, however, it was still a fun campaign. Took me a few characters to finish it, but I had a fun time doing it. Just...mind his quirks.


All and all, not the WORST Dm I’ve had (the scum on Roll20 knows no bounds) but definitely more of a 6/10. 7/10 when he finally let you roll initiative and take combat in turns rather then relying on a weird real-time-with-pause system.

The graphics are updated and generally look acceptable as far as can be done with Unity. I do want to complain that it looks a bit too cartoon-ish tho, which appears to have been adjusted in the next wrath of the righteous game according to the trailers. 

The pathfinder mechanism is rather accurately represented and provides multitudes of tactical possibilities-you have a flashback of the 3R NeverWinterNights 2. The kingdom building system is interesting but could really use some further polishing, namely, the settlement views should really have a way to reflect what you have built there, additional graphic details re Pitax and Capitol would be fun, and should be able to provide additional missions and adventuring opportunities. Then again, the plot setting Charname's team as the ruling authority does make sense for most missions to originate from your hall. 

The plot is interesting-particularly the hidden ending part. Nyrhissa is quite well written, but unfortunately I want to say that the other companions do not quite match the writing quality of Bioware in Baldur's Gate 2. Valerie(beauty), Amiri(feminism) and Jubilost(Gnome background) all have aspects of their stories which could go much deeper. Harrim is fun but could use additional writing to expand on his worldview and philosophy. I do like the witty exchanges between Octavia and the half-orc tho. Like all good CRPGs, the ability to proceed with the story through diplomacy is available, but again, I do think the writing could be improved and some of the alignment-related conversations appear a bit too...intentional.

Imagine this: You're in a fight, and you get stuck in a trap. Every turn you try and fail to get out of said trap, and you can do nothing for the whole combat encounter. But, combat ends. You say ""Okay, I try to get out of the trap"". You roll, you fail. ""Okay, roll again"", the DM says. You roll again. You fail again. ""Okay, roll again."" You roll and you fail.
The check to get out of the trap is a DEX roll with a DC of 20. You are a paladin with +0 DEX, but you were poisoned in the last fight, permanently losing two points of dexterity, making your DEX bonus a -1.
You roll a twenty-sided die, adding your dex bonus, which is -1. To pass the check, the total of your roll would need to be at least twenty. You have a -1 bonus. The die itself would need to show the number 21 for you to pass the check. The die only goes up to 20.
""Okay, roll again"". It has been five minutes. Everyone is looking at you. You start to get nervous. ""Okay, roll again."" You wonder if you're doing anything wrong. You have rolled the dice at least 50 times, yet you still can't pass the check. ""Okay, roll again"". 
Ten minutes have passed. Two of your fellow players left for a smoke break. Another is making a sandwich in the kitchen. The other is on his phone. ""Okay, roll again."" You roll, hoping to god that this can be over. It's already been ten minutes, how long could it possibly take for you to pass the check?

""Okay, roll again.""

One hour has passed. Everyone left. Everyone except you, and the DM. ""Okay, roll again."" You are absolutely sure that there is no way to pass the roll. You've forgotten how many natural twenties you've rolled, yet every time you do all you hear is— ""Okay, roll again."" You desperately want to leave, you want to get out of here, not just the trap inside the game, but this trap that you've been stuck in real life. When you triggered that fictional spider's web, you fell into the web of something much dangerous.  ""Okay, roll again.""

""Okay, roll again."" You've lost count of how much time you've spent rolling the dice. Your throat is parched, you can barely think, your dehydrated brain can only hear ""Okay, roll again."". You desperately wish you could stand up and drink some water, but it's impossible, you need to ""Roll again"". 

If this was a game, you could just reload. You wish that you had that ability. To go back in time, and not fall into that trap. To not have come here, to this stranger's house, who offered you the possibility of enjoyment playing a famous pathfinder module. What a fool you were. 

You know this is it. Your body can't take it anymore. Your organs are shutting down. The human body is 70% water, but yours must be abour 30% right now.  Between the cacophony of ""Okay, roll again"", you hear something different, something that you haven't heard in what feels like millenia. ""Okay, roll a constitution check."" Mustering the very last of your strength, your pruney fingers pick up the d20. Your weakened fingers accidentally drop the die. Natural 1.

The main thing that makes me hate it is that there are dozens of design decisions that make it such a huge time suck.

The worst thing of all is the constant reloading. Fail to pick a chest? RELOAD. Spend fourteen days leveling up your economy only to find out everything went to hell over the last 14 days? RELOAD. Didn't rest before the ninth major fight of the dungeon? RELOAD.

The bottom line is that unless you want to follow online guides to minmax every character and decision, your time is better spent on a different game.

Wot I liked
- No (well, very little) carebear BS: You can't read cause you're dumb? You'll fail the quest. You can't find the place cause there's no glowing exclamation sign and an arrow in the right direction? You'll fail. This game wouldn't say ""Wanna try again, duh?"" ""If you're having a hard day why wouldn't you lower the difficulty setting"". Perfect!
- Choices matter: if you turned down some quest or companion it might bite you in the ass 200 hours later;
- Dice roll is the king supreme! It matters a lot how you build your character, minmaxing is real important to succeed, however a bad roll can kill you, whereas a good roll can kill your opponent - and I think it's good! 
- So many classes and class combinations, like dozens core classes with 4 subclasses (each!) and dozens prestige classes;
- Tactical turn-based combat: fights are varied, challenging and fun;
- Story is solid - a tale of adventure, intrigue and trickery;
- Check out exquisitely written multipathed quests. Some of them are timed - you'd better hurry!
- Saving rolls matter, switching weapon sets matters, poisons matter, diseases matter, stat damage matters, stat drain matters, dying matters, discovering traps matter - it's not something you just forget. I was in a total dog house in the early game because of a couple of encounters with some contagious monsters; 
- Owlcat introduced some meaningful(-ish) alignment choices;
- AI is quite smart - they can go for weaklings, use spells and abilities;
- Skills provide loads of meaningful additional options and interactions both in dialogues, text interactions and in real world;
- The elf storyteller provides a-many stories for you to enrich this wondrous world;
- Various monster types, cool and smart encounters;
- I especially enjoyed the text interactions, which helped to fleshed out the world, making it twice the size it actually is;
- Beautiful backgrounds, scenery, art, voiceover;
- Most companions have quite a lot of interactions and interesting stories.

Wot I disliked
- The main problem of the game is that there's too little of it! The main campaign took me 200+ hours over the course of 3+ months. I just want more but there's no toolset for making custom user-made modules. The main campaign is great, the engine is ok, but what made NWN1 the (arguably) best D&D game ever was Aurora. P:K got no Aurora. If Owlbear had a better insight they would rather merge the new PK with the old one adding a robust, easy to use toolset for the years to come. Now it's just a 200-300 hours game and that's my main gripe with it;
- Writing feels a bit off, or maybe I just didn't like Linzi's style. While your hirelings have good background stories and interaction between party members is there, it falls short of being great;
- Buffing is an essential and fun (I strongly believe it) part of any rpg game. Being able to overcome the challenge, greatly boost your defence and offence is greatly satisfying... and is a huge pain because for some reason you can't queue your spells. It is a huge management issue cause you have to spend quadruple the time and clicking to buff your party. And you have to buff it quite often cause an average party has gas for a couple of major battles per rest; 
- Sneak attack is way too powerful. It is poorly implemented - you can sneak almost anyone and getting the opponent susceptible to it is laughingly easy thus making some sort of dual-wielding sneak damage dealer a must have for any party;
- I can't say I fancied Kingdom management part that much: it is alright, you get many choices, lots of meaningful choices and activities, connected to quests/items/companions some customization and a lot of replayablility. I wasn't that troubled with randomness - it is disappointing to miss a roll, that said, it is pretty nice to win that roll when you know you'd have missed it. I just dislike how every single crpg game forces a management simulator on you; 
- Some generic events from the kingdom management system turn up multiple times;
- There're still some exclamation marks left - I'm strongly opposed to them and would rather have the NPCs in-game tell me of the urgency of the task or of its location. Sometimes you might loose a quest because noone just told you to hurry up!
- Recipes hardly play a significant role - there're 1-2 good ones - the rest are junk. There is no crafting - and it's a huge loss as there're so many bits and pieces you can chop off monsters to make your enchanted golem bane orc blood turquoise pickaxe;
- The ""endless"" dungeon is underwhelming - there're basically 4-7 rooms per level, a shrine, 1-3 chests and some mobs. The layouts are boilerplate, the tiles are basically the same;
- There're quite a lot of bugs, the game does not run smooth, some feat descriptions are wrong, some spells either don't do what they should or have mistakes in the cards;
- Enemies / Summons won't trigger traps, you can't use pets to open booby chests;
- UI keeping track of buffs/debuffs could be better - this tiny strip gives little info - if you want more u gotta click;
- Lots of important shortcuts are missing. No shortcuts for wait, stealth, weapon sets - are u kidding me? 
- Interface is bad - you don't get vital information about the enemies' health / initiative / buffs / statuses; 
- Enemy NPC can't really utilize 5 ft step in TBM - which makes AoO kinda overpowered. What's more your guys quite often fail 5 ft step too - it's a skill which has to be mastered;
- Frankly, I did not like its name. It does not incur recognition of the pathfinder d20 system and before I researched the game I was really reluctant to dive in.

I'm so happy that I eventually got my hands on this outstanding game. I've noticed that I have many gripes with the game, and all those issues are quite real and important for me and detracted from the enjoyment of the game. But it is buggy not because of poor design decisions but because it has so much inside. It is a stupendously bold project and while it is not perfect I think of it as of an equal to NWN, BG and ToEE:CoE. [b]I haven't had such legit D&D experience for over a decade[/b]. It's so great to see a game that respects its roots.

P.S. I spend 3 days straight reading up on mechanics before even starting the game and I have years of experience playing NWN series, TOEE and - it was worth every single second. I have not had that much fun researching a game in oh so long.
P.P.S. I love you Pathfinder: Kingmaker!

Well, here I am, 100+ hours in.  And no, I can't recommend this game.  Pathfinder: Kingmaker is that unique kind of painful where it *clearly* has potential- there's good stuff in this game!- but it's so heavily marred by the bad that it just feels like a waste.  You know, the sort of game where it would be less bad if the game was bad all the way through.  

TL;DR: 4/10, not worth the time investment.  If you want more context:

THE GOOD:
- Interesting combat mechanics, at least in theory.  As someone coming from 5e, I actually really like the idea of, say, point blank ranged attacks provoking attacks of opportunity instead of being rolled at disadvantage.  

- Lore: Pathfinder has some neat lore!  The worldbuilding is fun and easy to pick up, even if you have zero prior knowledge of the setting.  

- Solid setup.  The concept of founding your own barony and dealing with all the political shenanigans that come with that?  Fantastic basis for a story.  

- Companions: They're not the deepest ones out there, but they're enjoyable enough.  Companions chatting to each other while setting up camp is a neat touch.  

THE BAD:
- Poor explanations of gameplay:  Look, I'm a hundred hours in on challenging, and I still don't understand the specifics on how combat maneuvers work.  Kingdom management also suffers from poor explanations (which comes with the added bonus of potentially ruining your game unless you switch it to auto).  

- Alignment restrictions:  Normally I'd be all over this, but the way it's implemented is just annoying.  Let me do an 'evil' thing as a good character- just, you know, change my alignment AFTER as a result instead of locking me out of the option entirely beforehand??  

- Lag:  The game will lag out on occasion, and the only real solution is to close the game and reopen it.  Not experience ruining, but mildly irritating.  

THE UGLY:
There's no way around this one: this game is designed as if your DM is a dick.  You wander around the map and find an enemy far above your level?  Fantastic!  Except there's no way to tell how strong enemies are until combat starts, and there's no real way to ESCAPE combat once started.  Whoops.

Combat mechanics are strict?  Not a problem!  Well, except the fact that enemies don't play by the same rules you do.  The (ranged weapon user) boss of the first act can fire as many arrows as he wants, and you can't land a single opportunity attack on him as he does so?  Very fun!  

Enemies with single weaknesses that CANNOT be beaten unless you've got an attack that deals a particular damage type?  Neato!  Hope this isn't a frequent- oh no it's everywhere now and you still can't escape combat.  Hope you've got a save to reload to!  

And this just gets worse as the game goes on.  Combat turns into an unfun slog where the 'difficulty' comes from unfair mechanics or bullshit enemy abilities rather than any sense of real challenge.  Are you playing an RPG because you like a solid balance of roleplay and combat?  Well, hope you like min-maxing or dropping the difficulty down to 'story', because it's gonna be a nightmare otherwise.  

Unfortunately, the story itself suffers from the same problems.  You remember the complaints about alignment?  Well, it's not just for sidequests anymore- hope you like being arbitrarily restricted from important story decisions as a result!  In an amazing 'screw you' to the player, the combat and story bullshit complaints align at the very end: [spoiler] wouldn't it be fun if we killed what was likely your main buffer character directly before the final dungeon?  And made sure that they were the ONLY companion that couldn't be revived or saved no matter what, because we needed to give you an 'extra reason' to really hate the villain? [/spoiler] 

Honestly, if this WAS a tabletop RPG, I would have quit long ago.  But it wasn't, and I spent too long with it.  Kingmaker is a bloated slog with all the good stuff loaded in the front- go play Baldur's Gate instead.",1629409366,1629409366,False,3,0,0.477594107389450073,0,True,False,False

The story is interesting, and the companions are memorable (kudos to whoever wrote Nok-Nok, Jaethal and Jubilost). The only complaint is that the combat becomes a bit repetitive at late game. The first time dealing with a group of wild hunt people / ghost guards is thrilling, but after knowing the trick (i.e. the cloud spells + delay poison combo, and legendary proportions for the latter) the encounters just feel like doing the same thing over and over again. It will be better if there are more 'types' of encounters instead of having the same enemies in greater numbers showing up again and again.

I also love the concept of the House at the Edge of Time, but walking through the entire place is confusing. I have to rely on the guides to find the third key, and I lost patience for the book puzzle so I just leave it unfinished. I think mostly because of the guards and wild hunt groups just appearing again and again, and I'm too lazy to kill them all. Facing the Knurly Witch and the Wiggly Man is interesting, however. If it is less tedious to clear the dungeon, maybe I can complete all the quests.

Another thing I hate is to collect all the fragments for the story teller. Some relics even have 15+ pieces to collect, and I quickly lost interest because the process is very dry to me. It is also very easy just to miss one, and returning to a place I already explored feels kinda meh.

Still, I enjoyed the game and the final boss fight (but I feel he is easier than the SoR fight. The SoR fight is probably the 1st difficult one in the entire game!).

While the voice acting is great, the environments are colorful and bright, and the character models are better than a lot of other games, I had to request a refund.  

The gameplay combines all the worst aspects of a terrible DM.  The battles are excruciatingly slow pitched (like watching a slow-mo of Baldur's Gate).  Your character dies to a stiff breeze, or a stern look.  Pedantic encumbrance rules have you deleting drops (even at level 2 with 3 strength characters in your party).  No-win conversations as every other interaction.  It's a laundry list of gameplay issues that make you sigh with frustration and feel like you have to walk through mud to play.

Here's a ""for example"":
At level 2, while you're following the main quest tracking another wizard, there's a ""gotcha"".  You click on a camp icon which forces your party to rest and *overwrites your autosave*.  Then, it pops an impossible-to-kill enemy for your level (and most classes).  You can't say ""Haha, you got me,"" because your save is gone.  It's either hope you have a recent main save... or restart the game completely.  So fun!

Seriously, this might be the first steam game I've ever requested a refund on.  I had such high hopes for it.

It has a lot of modding potential, akin to something like Neverwinter Nights, yet the save game files are so fragile that any issues with the mods has a high chance of permanently messing up your save so it is unloadable, losing hours upon hours of progress.  I get that is always a risk with mods, but in this case, wowzers.  It's too easy.  And can be unexpected, as many major and minor overhauls made broad sweeping changes to the code that weren't really announced.  There doesn't seem to be a save cleaning option.  It's not like a modded Skyrim save where a save can eventually be recovered with the right tools.

Additionally, the switch from regular Pathfinder Kingmaker to Definitive Edition made many of the popular mods unplayable, or otherwise suddenly introduced incompatibilities.  Adding the Turn-Based Combat function to the regular game was a nice first step, but it made the mod that did the same functionality no longer work, and the mod was much better and had more features.  And that's the story with a ton of mods.  Was your save made while those mods were valid?  Oops, too bad, you get to start over now.

Only solution really is to find an old version of the game from somewhere in order to play your save, then never ever update it.

So yeah, user beware.  Stock game, or jarringly high risk.  You could lose a 300+ hour save regardless of any planning or foresight.  Remember that when Wrath of the Righteous comes out too.",1629199646,1629200737,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like DnD, Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate, Divinity etc.... It's amazing, you'll love it instantly.

The mechanics are much more deeper/technical as its based on pathfinder's tabletop D20 rules, but that also means insane amount of customization and depth in your gameplay.

Kingdom management is meh but once you get the hang of it its manageable - I actually felt it added quite a bit to how you play the main narrative and it kinda made sense.

1. Enemy difficulty on normal
2. Kingdom Management on Effortless (You'll still get the same experience, just less RNG)
3. Carry more load mod (If you're coming from POE/POE2, encumbrance is quite a tedious thing not many people enjoy. Enable it if you are those kind that enjoy the genuine inventory/weight management system.)

Pathfinder is essentially a fork of DnD 3.5, so fans of games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale will feel right at home with familiar classes and rules. However, there are enough new things to make it feel somewhat fresh. I also appreciated the fact that difficulty settings in this game really mean it: I was rarely able to play above ""Challenging"" (the next level up from normal), and ""Unfair"" basically seemed impossible. 

Where the game falls apart is primarily in the kingdom management sections which are poorly documented, confusing, and overly punishing of failures. In fact, the more you fail the harder it becomes, leading to a potential unwinnable scenario even as you are coasting through the adventure portions of the game. Having a string of failures in kingdom management (even when your success is pegged at 70%+) is not entirely uncommon, so save scumming is recommended. The kingdom management interface is also clunky, requiring you to load screens repeatedly to get things done. A good example is town building. You should be able to cycle through towns at will to build things in each of them in one fell swoop. Instead, you have to click on an individual town (loading screen), build it out, leave (loading screen), click on another town (new loading screen), and so on. 

Another failure with the game is the ending. The last area (or last 2 areas) are slogfests with poor encounter design, repetitive and tedious enemies, and a noticeable lack of non-combat activities (whereas the earlier game emphasized them much more). It isn't really challenging once you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the enemies, which you will after the first encounter with them, but rather the length and repetition of them. On Challenging, these battles last awhile, while you just wait and watch. After the third fight like this, any novelty is gone. I ended up putting the difficulty on Story mode just to get through this boring area sooner. There were two optional quests here two which I skipped as well, whereas I tried to do all of the sidequests earlier in the game. Really just a missed opportunity for the devs here, and it's a shame their interest in designing a unique and fun final area evaporated in the game's final chapter. 

In the end, this is a game where the old saying about the journey being more important than the goal rings true. As bad as the final area is, it doesn't really detract from the earlier bits.

Had this time when my lvl3 party randomly encountered two giants that could one-shot even the tankiest in my group.
Or this time I entered some cavern I found, sent my rogue in stealth to do some scounting only to have him ambushed(!) by some wererats that had so much damage absorption weapons could'nt harm them, and chain-throwing AE flasks at my team on top of that.
And I don't even play on high difficulty.

You WILL die because you are unlucky, or entered an area while exploring you didn't know wasn't suited for your level.
It's not difficult. It's unfair.
Like playing Tabletop RPG with a sadistic DM who loves to kill your party just for the fun of it. His own fun, off course, not yours.

And it's a pity, because if you like Baldur Gate's style of game, it's pretty well done overall.

So I won't recommend it, unless you really love this kind of games, you have a lot of patience and dedication (it seems to have a good amount of content), or you are some kind of masochist.

Edit : after playing some more
The game is indeed very good, although it could do with a bit of QoL concerning all the travel time and running around -your party moves quite slowly around the map.

The kindom management part is interesting, but not that compeling. But it's nice to take decision and shape your country, and thankfully the rest can be automated if you don't want to engage with it. Note that managing your kingdom, if done wrong (or you're very unlucky), can lead you to lose the game.

From a gameplay standpoint, it's nice to have the choice between real time with pause, and turn based. You also can change the difficulty of the game at your leisure, which is welcomed as the game doesn't really hold your hand and some encounter can be quite tough. Thankfully, the problem I had with encountering unbeatable opponents becomes far less prevalent when you reach a decent level.

The story is interesting, and your companions, who seems at first glance to have very basic personalities, reveal a bit more complexity as your quest for them. Too bad that your interactions with them stay quite limited once the quests are done.

Developers say that they were inspired by Baldur's gate, Fallout 1/2, Arcanum and the like but they completely botched like two thirds of what made those games good. Things that weren't botched are amateurish instead. Now, that doesn't make this game outright BAD, it's just... lame in way too many aspects. 

Story seems fine at first - you are some random merc who is hired to take down a local bandit warlord in exchange for a minor noble title and becoming a ruler of a small buffer vassal state between local powers. And then you suddenly hear the familiar CHOOO-CHOOO and railroading begins. About 98% of all your choices both in and out of dialog don't actually do anything tangible in-game. The bane of bad RPGs - not actually being an RPG. You may do everything there is to do - and will still fail, often in very unrealistic and outright stupid circumstances because there is only an illusion of choice - the outcome was set from the start, often with neglect towards game design.

A simple example: resurrection. In DnD and it's derivatives resurrecting someone dead (if soul was not destroyed) is easy. Resurrecting someone recently deceased while the soul still hasn't left the body is SUPER easy. Well... the game sets up certain standard when you whack one minor villain and then major villain teleports in, resurrects him and teleports out. 

You can do that too, right? Actually, no. You will get in a situation where 2 of your officials will be knee-deep in crap and you won't be able to help both unless you are Lawful. One of them (you decide who) will be killed in front of you. No big deal, right? Wrong. You can't resurrect either of them even if you are capable to. And, chances are, you will be completely f-ed because only 3 people can fill given government positions and if all of them die or were missed during their hiring window that's game over. There was outrage, developers 'fixed' this by allowing random mercs take government positions but they don't allow to make any decisions and will always make default choices in event resolutions often messing things up. 

Ironically, you WILL get an option to resurrect a noble you whacked for backstabbing you. There will also be a quest to get stuff from a smuggler, he'd be dead and you will have an option to offer pension to his widow. Just resurrect him doe? Nope.

Basically, rest of the game ""works"" in a similar manner:

- You have to scout your kingdom yourself and on foot. You can't go-off-road or use a boat despite most of your kingdom being connected by water. 36 hour detours? Easy. You do get the ability to send out scouts... two thirds into the game to make sure you didn't miss anything.

- Companions, items and events spawn during random parts of the story in random places you have already cleared and have no reason to come back to, I've stumbled across some by pure chance and missed 2 companions for good. Ironically, companions spawned and despawned but 2 peasants I saved on that location when I first went there were still standing there saying they're gonna go home soon. 3 months after I saved them. 10/10!

- Developers didn't bother programming petrification so getting petrified is instant death. Not a common thing, but still stupid.

- Encounters are lazy. True Sight (ability to magically see invisible and hiding) is completely useless because enemies often just spawn out of thin air around you. Most of them are either very easy or very hard.

- Inflation is insane, both EXP and gold-wise. Later in the game time between level-ups can be easily dozen hours. Gold doesn't buy you anything good and you can't use it to order specific things you want so I've spent 90% of the game with a garbage longsword because there just were no upgrades to get. You will spend 80% of your loot gold investing into your kingdom. Which, actually, doesn't do anything. Mercenaries, of the other hand, cost an arm and a leg, literally ~60% of the gold you currently have, May the Cheat Engine be with you.

- Characters with different running speeds don't hold formation so tall humanoids in light armor (mages) will always be first. To get whacked when they run into enemies.

- Your levelcap is 20. I vacuumed the whole map, savescummed all events and got to lvl 20 only during final dungeon. You will often face enemies of 25, 30 and even 35 level. 'Technically', you have the numbers advantage but A LOT of stats like saving throws, attack rating etc are derived from the level, so... good luck dispelling a curse that turned your cleric into a dog with a difficulty rate of 34 when your caster is lvl 14. You've guessed it, enjoy your 15 reloads.

- Speaking of reloads, the game weighs whopping 40 gigs and, being a Unity game, load times without SSD are very, VERY sad. But you get all items in the game rendered in 3d on your characters in real time. Cool, huh? Especially considering bird eye camera.

- 40 gig Unity game = laggy UI. Nothing beats trying to click a spell on hotbar and sending your mage running into enemies instead

- City building and kingdom event systems are COMPLETELY disconnected from each other and the base gameplay. Apart from building shops for your artisans whether you build something or anything at all except for teleportation circles is completely irrelevant. Amusingly, you get 1, 2 and 4 hex buildings depending on the size of your settlement and hexes are distributed in a way that 75% of the time you will actually have to tear down your small buildings to be able to fit bigger ones in. Brilliant design. Those buildings don't actually do anything whatsoever in their absolute majority, so whatever.

- Kingdom 'ruling' is just a huge pile of coin toss 'events' and pseudo decisions that don't actually do anything. For example, you get an opportunity to hire a dwarven ghost to make STRONK lvl 25 advanced golems to guard your capital. Those golems will just hang around and mysteriously disappear every time crap hits the fan and fighting breaks out. LMFAO. By the way, your army, national guard and allies will suck no matter how much you invest in them (lvl 5 troops, lvl 10 commanders) and are just complete waste of time and money that die in 2 hits while average endgame mob attacks at least 3 times per round.

- Companions and romance options... sigh. A male hoe, a female hoe (who are a hoe couple), a generic elf boi and even more generic concrete brick that, technically, is a woman. Oh, and DLC twins where you can't have the good one if you don't take the bad one first. Their romances, you've guessed it, don't actually do anything tangible. There are somewhat well-written characters who would make much better and reasonable romantic options that could be integrated into their quest lines (Jamandi, Amiri, Melianse etc), but considering overall game design it's not surprising. 

- More of a DnD problem, but moral alignment often doesn't make any sense. In my opinion, Neutral Good and Neutral Evil should not be a thing altogether and a good 60% of choices should be just Good or Evil without connotation. More often than not it just makes no sense.

- Another DnD problem: spells are a complete mess. 80% of them are hot garbage (good luck cursing a level 25 dude with 30 magic resist as a level 14 caster) so you're often left with using spell-level altering traits and filling your high-level slots with hightened low level spells. A lot of those spells don't have friendly fire off while having 9000 radius making them useless for anything but surprise attacks to initiate combat. Remember I wrote above that enemies often just spawn on your party's head? Have fun.

Bottom line: not good, not a disaster either. Original, pre-definitive edition version was complete garbage. This one is sorta kinda okay to get at a 50% discount. Sorta. Kinda. It's just a mish-mash of random ideas crudely slapped together and raised as a Frankenstein's monster with an 'RPG' label slapped on it's forehead.",1628555510,1628556331,False,3,1,0.490454912185668945,0,True,False,False

I reckon most people playing this will at least have some familiarity with either D&D or Pathfinder, and you really need it - one of the shortcomings is that it doesn't seem to explain the effects of stats and abilities, which is key information. I knew roughly what was going on as I'm familiar with D&D, but know nothing about the Pathfinder ruleset. I had to do a lot of Googling to find out what certain things did and it'd be great if they included more of that in the game. That being said, it's worth trying.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Having just come from a Roll20 D&D campaign, it was really engaging to actually have a properly interactive game with basically the same rules (to a non-specialist, D&D and Pathfinder are more or less the same)
- It shows you your rolls, and what an enemy rolled when they miss you rather than just the results
- Pretty spell effects
- You can toggle between 'real time combat with pause' and 'turn based' combat. Generally turn based is much better, but there are a lot of low level enemies in the game where you can just leave it on auto pilot
- Lots of voice acting
- Precise movement, not grid based
- Feels like a modern version of Baldur's Gate 2, which I enjoyed as a kid
- The 'quest journal' actually has an in-game reason; a bard following you around writing down everything you do

[b]Cons[/b]
- My mage was hidden behind a solid bookshelf, and an archer shot straight through it and killed him
- Crashed several times
- There are SO MANY misses, on both sides. It makes combat take way longer than it needs to
- The ""Always display enemy HP in turn based mode"" doesn't work

640820,95391698,76561198067005338,707,7,13578,0,13575,1672565904,"I have played this game for 226 hours and it was a completely miserable time.

In short the whole game seems to be balanced by ""That Kid"" at the playground who just cannot be bested and always has one more trick up their sleeve. ""Oh, Combat Maneuvers are handy? Well all my dudes have a +30 or more to their CMD"" and ""Yeah well I have 50AC and my +25 to all my saves"" are the two that spring first to my mind with ""I make 6 attacks in each turn and my 6th has a +29 to hit"" being the third one.

Cons:
- Level Pacing: It's horrid. Near the end of the game you're probably around level 16 or 17 with a party of 6 people. The mobs you're fighting come at you in packs of 12-15 and are all level 24 or higher, each with DR, high saves, high AC, high BAB, and various spell-like abilities. Even early game it's a little weird because at around level 5-6 you're expected to be able to take on 4-6 trolls at a time, sometimes one even has barbarian levels.
- Companions: This game *requires* you to have dedicated DPS Casters, Healers, and stallers. Yes there are two good clerics available, and even a really good staller, but your choice for DPS Casters is two people, neither of whom are particularly good (at base) and one of whom has their levels split between Rogue and Wizard which also makes them one of two rogues available (and the only one for a while). As far as their personalities go they are ""Pretty okay"". I like their banter during Resting but they are mostly just a pain when you get to Kingdom related stuff (which I won't go into because of spoilers).
- Kingdom stuff: You're on a ticking clock the entire game, and a couple hidden ones too. Once each chapter starts you have about 280 in-game days to complete the Main Quest for the chapter, do all the companion stuff (or they ""get sad""), and then also work on your kingdom because my dude who handles the Law in a Lawful Good kingdom doesn't know what to do about Pirates attacking our boats. Other kingdom stuff involves ""events"" that you need your people to handle. A hidden mechanic of this is the kingdom's ""Stability"", which when it gets low enough loses the game for you. A small issue one might encounter (I almost did) is that if an event isn't ""resolved (completed successfully) in the month that it's available you could drop your stability one stage (out of four). You could have a person in a seat so underwhelming at their job that you might only have a 33% chance to succeed and, if the stars refuse to align, might never succeed and just lose the game thanks to dice rolls and people being afraid of fog.
- Alignments: Lawful Good is effectively ""Follow the letter of the law to a T and kill anybody who hasn't"", but ""law"" could also be seen as outright oppression judging by most of the dialogue. Chaos is, more or less, free spirit and will. Sparing somebody's life after besting them in combat and forgiving them is Chaotic Good. Killing them then and there is Lawful Good. I can't quite pin down what ""good"" is, since it's all over, but Evil is anything even remotely not benevolent, ranging from withholding information to attacking citizens on the street. Neutral? 100% apathy.
- Enemy stats: Why is it that, at the end of Chapter (Redacted) I am expected to be able to fight a dude with 40+ AC, a +50 to-hit, 6 attacks in a turn, does over 50 damage per hit (through 12 DR/-), and all of his level 12 adds while I am also just level 12? The enemies are boosted to all heck and many of them have buffs on them that cannot be dispelled, such as one that just has Greater Invisibility on it and Glitterdust doesn't do anything (even though it should). Sure my Staller was up to 52AC near the end of the game but they were still getting hit quite frequently. Sure they had DR 28/ Good but I wasn't fighting ""good"" things and STILL getting hit for 20+ damage at a time against 10+ mobs.
- Restoration: You NEED Restoration, lesser or otherwise. Stat Drain and Damage is going to happen. It's unavoidable, so many things can do it to you that you're going to need to stockpile scrolls and potions.
- Story: Interesting at first but it quickly boiled down to ""Oh man we killed Curse 1 but now Curse 2 is here and we gotta kill that one"". The final boss, even, wasn't a surprise. Even though I've never played the original Module I saw the ""twist"" coming a mile away, even the final boss once I saw them for the first time it was a no-brainer.


Pros:
- Music: It's lovely music, truly is. The main city theme is quite nice to sell 1000lbs of gear for only 18k GP to.
- Art Style: It's quite nice, very Pathfinder-and you can actually see the various boots and gloves you equip to a person, even the armors are mostly unique between each other. Portraits for each character, all sizes, are lovely too.
- Custom Portraits and Characters: Ignoring the absolutely crazy price for a custom character (""Mercenary"") you can, if the mood strikes you, make effectively another player character. Fighter with 15 charisma not your ideal tank? Make a better one. That Wizard/Rogue not your cup of tea? Make a better one, give them a custom portrait, and name them Harry Poggers.



Tl;dr Out of the 226 hours of this game I played spread between three or four attempted playthroughs, I cannot recommend this game. It's a slog, the story is uninteresting, the Kingdom mechanic is poorly explained, and if you're too fast at the main story you can find yourself with 150+ in-game days of staring at the City Screen passing time. Don't get this game, pick up a hobby instead.

Regarding QoL/UX, you loot all this food, yet camping to restore health and spells relies on rations which can only be hunted (takes time) or purchased at great weight from vendors.  The food is useless.  Thus, when in a dungeon, you're forced to slog all the way back outside just to camp.  This is by far my biggest gripe.

Character selection and abilities are very standard.  The elemental damage doesn't seem to have much impact.  I would've liked to see better buff/debuff effects on spells (ie frost spells have a chance to cause slow, casting lightning in the rain/puddles creates extra damage - things the Divinity series does well).  As it stands, spam magic missile and have a tank present and you're in good shape.  But again, after casting 4 missiles in a single battle, you're forced to camp to relearn spells (see above complaint about camping).  This makes quest progression a chore.

Re: RNG, would like to see skills and abilities either more clearly or actually affect rolls more so there isn't so much missing. So many spells wasted on misses which in turn goes to QoL->camping.  I get that it's based on tabletop rules, but some critical thought and flexibility would've been appreciated.

Pros
1.Voice acting.
2.Music.
3.Able to Shape shift.
4.Able to play as a beast master.
5.Able to play as a summoner.
6.The amount of quality things to do in this game is staggering. 
7.The world is nice.
8.I like the choices i can make, Gain a troll army lose a archer fair trade.

Neu
1.Would of been nice to change the fur colors on your pets and yourself if you took on beast forms.
2.Annoying that i can't respec my characters on unfair mode but since i'm on unfair i'll let it slide, just sucks needed a offensive mage and the elf girl isn't cutting it with her locked build.
3.So you can turn foes into friends but i feel like they they missed out on by not letting them join your party, i would of loved to have the troll king in my squad 

Cons
1.Partial voice acting, go full on va or don't do it at all.
2.If your player character dies you have to reload, i have rez scrolls let me use it.
3.Been playing on unfair and it lives up to it's name, i just feel like it could of been balanced more. Only really annoying when a range character aims for your mc and 1 shots him or when you have 12+ ""ppl"" gave everyone a pet, trying to take out one wolf and all of you get your as* beat cuz no one can land a hit.
4.Pathing, tell them to go a safe direction and they run to a melee mob and then try to go the way i told them first but since it was a melee mob it means it gets a free hit ending up with a dead party member.
5.I don't like how you can skip weeks in the kingdom manager but you still have to spend a night of resting to heal, so instead of spending 7 days of not getting sh*t done your spending 8 days.
6.I hate how it goes to a cut scene where a npc gets killed while my group just sits there and stares, no i'm here and i can kill the attacker so let me move.
7.Unresponsive clicking, f*cking spamming to click a ability with nothing happening and no i'm not paused or under crowd control affects.
8.Not voice acting important moments and forcing me to read when you think that this is sooo god dam important they would like me to feel the weight in their words, god i hate partial voice acting.",1625412347,1628123568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted so much to like this game. I love pathfinder and I was so excited to finally get to play this! But... It just doesn't work.

This game feels like they took two different games; Kingdom management sim and adventure/exploring dungeon crawling, and tried to smush them together quite unsuccessfully. You pretty much never ave time to explore as much as you want, as you're always rushing back to your capital to deal with events and advisers that lock you at your capital for 2 in game weeks. 

There are also so many hidden timed events, that you can easily fail because you didn't know they were timed and you just wanted to upgrade your city and that costs you 2 weeks...

But I still trudged on, because I could see the good underneath it's problems. And then: The House at the Edge of Time. The final dungeon. It is so needlessly convoluted it made me wish I had never bought this game at all. One moment in particular the game tells you you need to find a key. That's it. No more direction, you just have to wander the (basically) 6 levels of this dungeon searching for this key. I ended up having to check a walkthrough to find it. 

But the biggest problem with this final dungeon is the fact that at the very start of it the game decides to KILL YOUR BARD. YOUR MAIN MAIN BUFFER/DEBUFFER WHO YOU'VE RELIED ON THE WHOLE GAME. Now you have to traverse 6 levels of an incredibly difficult dungeon without a necessary character. It just felt incredibly punishing for no reason.

Good:
- The plot was OK and I liked the early premise of just having a kingdom and making it bigger.
- The game mechanics work: Battle system works, path finding of the characters works, etc.
- Good graphics and had no FPS issues.
- Character building and development is fun and putting together a six member group with optimized skill sets is exciting.
- NPC character arcs were interesting and it was nice that the game kind of ""forced"" me to take each and every character to the team at some point.

Bad:
- The ""dream world"" sequence/chapter(s) were annoying and I had to read some walk-throughs to get through them without losing my patience.
- The two final chapters are full of boring fights with enemies that have extremely annoying spells that require specific counter-buffs. There were so much fighting, that I dropped the difficulty level to easy just to avoid the repetitive fights (turned it back on for the final boss fight though). 
- The final chapter areas also drop +5 ÜBER-weapons and armors all the time and it is kind of lame. After spending 100 hours going through every single side area, the rewards feel really weak, then suddenly the ""drop-rates"" skyrockets and your hard work seems a bit meaningless.
- Kingdom management is so much fun at first, but then gets repetitive and if you are not able to level up your help fast enough you will end up in a situation where you are not able to handle any of the occurring problems. This didn't F-up my game, but I had to result in A LOT of save-reload crap towards the end.
- A lot of small things that could be quite easily fixed/made better (probably) annoyed me, but nothing really broke the camels back.

Playing tips to maximize the fun and avoid feeling like working when playing the game:
- I highly recommend that you put the management setting to ""AUTO"" after a couple of chapters and concentrate on the best part of the game; Adventuring, quests and kicking some monster asses.
- Add more quick-save and auto-save slots. There are several ways of screwing up situations...
- I will have the ""remove the negative effects after rest"" setting ON the next time I'll play this. There are way too many stat/level draining monsters around and dealing with the drains is just boring running around.

Even though I might sound negative, I would give this game 9+/10. I got good 100 hours of entertainment out of it and if I had spent less time with the kingdom management (or if it would be less hectic) and there would have been less fighting/more variety with the end-game enemies, I would rank this game higher than Pillars of Eternity 2.

Currently at the time of this review I am 159 hours into my first game and I have about 30% of the map explored... So she has some chunk to her. 

Story line isn't what you are use to, where it gradually gets more and more intense until the final climactic ending. This plays more like a series then a movie. You get multiple plot points to give you some sense of direction, but overall it plays like a fantasy sim. It honestly captures a day to day life of being an adventurer in a fantasy setting very well. 

Could use a polish for the next game, graphically its okay but I've argued BG2 looks better, and the music need attention plus more variety. Even though they give a good amount of companion characters, I feel like they were made with a specific set of builds in mind, and sorta lack in variety. 
Honestly though, I am looking forward to the next game, hoping they keep this going for a while, As most crpgs are switching to turnbased, its nice to see these Dev's embrace BOTH ways of playing, giving you the option to switch between the two (TB & RTC) on the fly was just a cherry on top, and should be industry standard. I give this game high praise, its a D&D like game with elements of the sacred crpgs we hold to high regard, but with added spice.

The integration of the DLC was amazing (thou confusing as to when to start it) and I would hope to see that again in the next game, but maybe with the ability to recruit the character we made, that'd be awesome. All-in-all great addition nonetheless.

The Good:
+Graphics are detailed and run well.
+Voice acting and sound effects are consistently good.
+Lots of choices in character creation.
+Enhanced Edition was a free update!

The Bad:
-The combat is such a chore, I think they needed to automate more of the tabletop aspects.
-Being a fairly close adaptation, the game suffers from caster supremacy.
-Which means you should find a guide, so you don't end up with a gimped party.
-The kingdom aspect sadly never really jives with the core exploration and combat.
-Artificial game design that sets you up for defeats or blindsides you with traps.

Bottom Line:
I had high hopes for this and followed the kickstarter pretty closely. Sadly, after several characters and playstyles, I just cannot get into it. The story is decent and the voice acting is above average, but the gameplay just slows things down massively.

The current version was completely stable and didn't crash a single tim nor did any of the quests have any issues.

You call yourself a RPG fan? Get it!
The story is really long, you have tons of sidequests and they really take everything into account, even things I had already forgotten about because the game is so long.
At the current point - 252 hours - I played through the main story once (Some scenario or dialogue plays out and I'm like ""Oh yeah, I remember now that I actually did that"")

Graphics are the usual, Music is ok but the gameplay itself is just mindblasting.
From beginning to the end, the difficulty keeps up with your party. There is a reason why the game tells you to adjust your difficulty setting if you struggle.

Your choices actually have short- and longterm effects both foreseeable and unforseeable.

Each companion has its own personality and a side story which goes over multiple parts.
You can respec your character and the companions or create custom companions if you don't like the ones that are available.

The riddles and quests vary between ""That was easy"" and ""How the hell should I knpw what to do here"" but none of them are relevant to the point of being gamebreaking.

The only ""bad"" thing about it is that it is so massive, that I won't play it through with another character in the near future.

Not knowing how the game really works will require a first run of pain and extreme frustration, but once you get the hang of the skill mechanics (and have googled just about everything in the game) it is very fun.

Positives: Great story, very detailed lore, fun to create characters over and over, great combat/spell effects, companion stories are well done, many different choices to make and different game outcomes. Love the mix of kingdom building + adventuring.

Negatives: You have to play a certain way or you will fail (proper selection of skills, always full buffing to get through encounters..not knowing that things are very timed and you have to manage your kingdom well from the start will result in extreme frustration in the late game (unless on easy mode..which fortunately there are various difficulty settings).  AI is very cruel sometimes (eg. try to get a fallen companion up during battle, good luck, they will go right back down in the dirt lol)
Lots of reloading..unless you know what to expect from previous run. Lots of having to look things up online as some things are ridiculously impossible to figure out without doing so.
Excessive resting required. Kingdom management and building is good but at the same time there seems to be little point to the actual buildings than to up your kingdom stat numbers. Cookie cutter towns/villages.

But still, I can't recommend this game to anyone. It is completely and utterly destroyed by bugs and the encounters are so drastically overtuned you will have to reload 10+ times for ALOT of encounters (some even more) on normal difficulty, even with a good team.
I am not new to CRPGs by any means. I played BG 1+2, Fallout2, Neverwinter Nights 1+2, DA:O, PoE1+2 and Divinity OS1+2.
Nor am I new to pen and paper in any way (heck, I even work on creating my own rulebook).

Playing this game feels like having a DM who is seriously awesome at telling a story, but has some serious mental issues and just wants to see the group frustrated. A DM you play 2, maybe 3 sessions with before you realize you are not actually having fun and quit the campaign.

Edit: It still has some annoying bugs, alignment shifts are sometimes very questionable and the game is about as balanced as the wages paid at companies like Blizzard, but with the introduction of turn-based mode and most feats and mechanics actually working, the game has become a lot more enjoyable.
Once you hit mid-game almost all encounters actually become too easy, which is a funny contradiction to the stupidly inflated stats and enemy count of the earlier encounters.
The Pathfinder ruleset itself is probably largely to blame as well for the inconsistency and..
..the difficulty to create a compelling difficulty.
Pen-and-paper rulesets aren't focused on balancing, but on ways to create memorable events. This game is very combat-heavy, which makes those balancing issues very apparent.

I've changed the review to positive, because the game has become enjoyable to me personally as I'm a huge fanboy of the CRPG format and apparently so are the developers, though for different reasons. 
It's become clear to me that they like it for the variety of ways to build and optimize a character/party, strategize through combat encounters and tell a story, while I like it mostly for finding creative solutions to a problem. Emphasis on finding a creative solution, not being given a creative solution, which is what this game does.

Pathfinder 1st edition is by far and away the best TTrpg out there right now with a richness of depth and intricacy that Kingmaker captures perfectly.  By any measure a close to perfect game except for one  huge glaring problem; dice.  As with SO many games that are virtually perfect, for whatever reason designers decide to poison their entire game with what can only be described as a cheating RNG system that is anything but random.  This is almost as bad as X-com.  I say almost because nothing comes close to X-coms self immolating and self sabotaging RNG system that is world famous for it's blatant cheating.  But Kingmaker really tries to make a go of it.  During one run through I started to notice that I was failing EVERY skill check.  It didn't matter what...mobility, diplomacy, trickery, you name it.  So, I decided just to see what was happening.  On one skill check I saved and redid it to see how many tries I would need.  All i needed was over and 8.  It took me 22 reloads to pass the check.  I rolled 8 crit fails.  That is deliberately pathetic.  I want to experience the game not be bogged down by a game system that serves as a ####Lord DM that rolls dice behind a screen, doesn't look at them and says, ""you failed"" at nearly every turn.  I recommend the game but be prepared to save frequently and spend 3-4 times as long as the game really is having to reload to reroll just so you can pass a few checks.

Interesting rule set and a good implementation of them as far as I can tell (first time playing pathfinder but familiar with similar systems). The early difficulty is very spiky and shows why DMs are important to smooth things out. The first 5 levels felt like a roller coaster as I was constantly fighting enemies too difficult then too easy. Luck makes or breaks the game early, which is to be expected in a game based on rolling dice, but too often winning feels like chance rather than good tactics. The game seems to reward exploration at times with ample hidden caches of items and tons of locations but having to constantly rest and sparse early healing makes moving around the map feel like a chore. As for the story it has an interesting premise but it never really hooked me. Everything seems like a foregone conclusion including getting your own kingdom. Characters have some interesting stories behind them too which is nice yet every time someone shows up its ""Hello, I'm here to join your party!"".  Lastly there are quite a few bugs. In my time playing I had characters get pushed into walls and stuck while trying to move a party up a ramp, characters unable to do anything including even end their turn after being cc'd, and several abilities not working as you'd think they should (spellblade magus not being able to cast/melee in the same turn, spells not casting and not showing any failed or succeeded rolls).

Here you start out as a group of adventurers, then you end up controlling your own newly created kingdom. So you build villages, build improvments in your villages and in your capital, there is some special buildings you get access to that depends on your choices in the game when adventuring and your. 
There is also different positions that you can assign to different people, and what will happen in different situations can depend on who you have choosen for that post, these people can be part of your adventuring band or people you have met and invited to your capital out in the game world. You can also send these people out on missions on the world map.

This is the kind of game that I have hungered for since the days of Birthright, and the second game seems to be even better, love it, love this game company. Other games also have a base where you can do stuff, but they are often limited in what you can do and a bit dissapointing when one knows what can be done.

Baldurs Gate II also had a homebase where you could do a few things, but nothing like this, her you get a whole kingdom with a capital city and villages that you decide where to place and what to build in them and how to build them, same with the capital offcourse.

The story is interesting and intriguing, the combat works great, so the game have good mechanics and is a pleasure to play.
I do not want to reveal to much, but no matter what kind of character one play it seems that one will have good and fun choices.

The voice acting, while not constant as in a AAA game, is amazing whenever present.  The characters feel alive, the story is engaging and flows organically from one point to the next and the maps are varied and beautiful.  With weather and day/night cycles there is an element of randomness that can alter how you experience the world and with so many fleshed out companions you will likely find a party that matches your character's beliefs and preferences.

Two potential downsides. 
 1) The companions (while generally very cool) are linked to the story.  This makes sense to make the story feel more real and engaging but the downside is that there are some companions that 50-60 hrs in I still will not have seen, much less had a chance to bring into my party. 
2) This story is massive.  With 7 chapters of content and DLC I'm looking forward to 200+ hours.  But with such a long story you will probably need to treat this like a real DnD game.  Meaning you should have a word document to keep notes of places you meant to return to, character builds you were doing (feats and level orders) or how you'd like to develop your kingdom.  I find these things enjoyable but if you are looking for a casual time this game is not that (except maybe on story difficulty)

Until I recently realised that an Enhanced Edition had been released, along with some interesting DLC. So I checked it out again, and guys, what a great injustice I had made to this game. I am totally hooked. Why?

- Time limits on quests make the game more immersive and believable to me. I finished not too long ago CP2077 and I found quite grating that I could literally leave hanging out, for weeks, the people who were supposed to be my friends.

- Big parties in CRPGs greatly increases the tactical possibilities. I really enjoy rotating companions, to come up with a line up that is optimised for a particular kind of situation. In Pathfinder: Kingmaker, the same encounter can play out very differently (like orders of magnitude easier or more difficult) if you happen to bring the right stuff.

- Which brings me to the next point. Knowledge is power. And often knowledge comes after death. Save wisely. If the die rolls on the encounter table bring along an Air Elemental and the PC with the highest level in your party is level four... run away or reload. If a non-random encounter was unfair, observe closely how you fail, die, reload, and THEN bring the right stuff. Dying over a few times (or many) until you get it right is the salt and pepper of challenging games. This is not a Sekiro/Dark Souls game where you need to achieve some kind of zen state to make progress. If you get distracted by your partner, children or the noise of a creaky house in the middle of the night... reload (or turn on the turn-based mode).

- With a couple of exceptions, the voice acting and writing is immersive and relatively interesting. Golarion is an interesting place to set a fantasy RPG campaign. If Glorantha is my no. 1 fantasy world, and Forgotten Reals was the 2nd, I think Golarion could become the 2nd and very close to the first.

- The turn-based mode is superbly implemented. In Pillars of Eternity 2 I found it very slow, in Pathfinder it flows really, really well. Also the Pathfinder rule set is just awesome.

- The Kingdom gameplay is definitely the weakest link in the chain. I find it provides some flavour, and places you in the world, something which I think is very important in RPGs to become invested. And it is DEFINITELY more meaningful than the metagame in Pillars of Eternity I.

I am probably half-way of this playthrough, or maybe a third? This is a HUGE game. I think it is also GREAT value for your money. Give it a try!",1627394738,1627477441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
===
1. Very D&D-ish, so those familiar with Dungeons and Dragons system would feel at home.
2. Actually emulates 90% of tabletop Pathfinder system, unlike most D&D computer games like Neverwinter Nights that skips out on lots of the details that make RPG fun. Eg. cantrips worked with sneak attacks, Ranged Legerdemain actually works for arcane tricksters, etc.
3. Party-based adventures, and you can even make your own character as party member (at a super steep price).
4. Easy on older, low-tier graphics cards. I'm playing on AMD R7 250 and it is smooth at 1920 x 1080 in medium settings.
5. Turn-based and real-time combat is switchable at any time, which is cool. I'd usually select turn-based combat for extremely difficult situations where you don't want your party members going all over the places on their own and getting into trouble.

Cons
===
1. Balancing adventure and kingdom can be tough, and the auto-Kingdom manager doesn't work well for events that deeply affect the kingdoms. I've game sessions where my kingdom was ruined because the party spent too long outdoors and the kingdom Problems brought it down to the point where my kingdom is destroyed.
2. Attention to details means that Normal and higher difficulty can easily turn a simple random encounter into a story-shattering mayhem as you got your companions crushed to perma-death. Choose Easy or lower if you are the type of guy who don't want friends to die.
3. Journeying back and forth between capital and adventure spots can be tedious, especially near end-game where your capital is like weeks away from the furthest locations.
4. Being in a certain alignment will prevent some dialogue options from being shown, and I'm not really comfortable with that limitation. It's much preferable to allow players to choose whatever they want even if that would shift their alignment.
5. It can be hard to track which location you should go to for a certain quest once you already viewed the quest (which will remove the exclamation mark icon).

I can almost see the original conversation where someone said ""I want to make a Pathfinder experience on the computer exactly like the tabletop so people can enjoy it digitally. I want to take all the components and rules of Pathfinder and put it straight onto the PC, so the experience isnt like any other rpg game""

Well thats awesome, and a great place to start, but what they've done is taken this concept and applied it with the religious fervour of suicide bomber. It is as if they went out of their way to change as little as humanly possible in the conversion of making this a video game. This was a poor idea.

RNG/Dice work well on tabletop, for games like Pathfinder and D&D, for two key reasons;
1) it takes pressure off the dungeon master, who can rely on dice to make decisions and calculations for them quickly. It also helps prevent DMs from making poor/biased decisions by forcing them to use randomness. On the tabletop version a human being is in charge of the narrative.
2) it helps mimic the randomness we invariably get in life; just because i have a good idea and make a good attempt at executing it, doesn't mean it will work. In the tabletop games, players can come up with literally anything they want and so it's really important that dice throwing/randomness is introduced to help control their ideas.

Now the funny thing with video games is that THEY ARENT CONTROLLED BY HUMANS. That is to say, the computer does all the narration for you, it has all the characters' thoughts and dialogue pre-determined for you to choose and all the quests are linear. All the player has to do is sit in a chair and follow the prompts. The actions of the characters and the quests they follow are all on railroad tracks and so RNG is much less important, since all the possible outcomes are already known. And yet in this game it's as if you cant sneeze without a dice being rolled to see  whether your brain flies out. 

Because of this the difficulty level is all over the place and seemingly simple or straight forward quests and decisions just fail because a dice says so. And these arent small failures either, these failures can be game ending. In particular, late game event cards have these ridiculous Difficulty Checks (DCs), where if you fail can destroy your kingdom and cause immediate game over. Or you will run into low level enemies who can wipe out your whole party in a single spell. In fact I have this very example where early in the game, when confronting the kobold antagonist, my party is forced into this narrow cave corridor to approach him. What happens when the fight starts? The Kobold just launches a fireball and instantly eviscerates my party. I have no room for them to manoeuvre out of the way or solve this issue and at level 2 there's flip all options for them - if the RNG decides they die, well then heck 'em; they die. My only recourse - and this has happened at least a dozen times while playing - is to keep reloading until the RNG is in my favour; this is terrible. You should never put players in a situation where randomness decides whether they can advance the plot or not. You especially shouldn't do that if the only way to fix that failure involves backtracking through HOURS of gameplay to somehow change the RNG calculation. I can't believe that even has to be said but the thing is this happens ALL the time in this game.

Furthermore, the pacing for combat is ruined because soooo many shots - on both sides - are misses, so you will literally just be sitting there watching as nothing happens. Here we have 6 of the deadliest warriors in the Broken Lands and yet they can't hit a boar that has slipped and is literally lying still on the ground? IT MAKES NO SENSE. This is an issue on the tabletop too but the difference is its much less noticeable, and much less of an issue, in that kind of setting where everyone waits patiently for their turn, has time to think while others act, and have others there to interact with. But this is a video game and I am in control of the entire party and the sole player, so its so important to keep combat/gameplay quick and entertaining.

That's not where the issues with combat end. For some reason the default combat method in this game is a free-for-all ""real time"" slug fest rather than the usual Pathfinder turn based system. I guess they did this because (as i mentioned above) the fights can become really drawn out. This combat system is f**king terrible and the equivalent of a giant rugby scrum where you cant discern wth is going on. Yes, you have the option to pause and give instructions but its practically impossible to keep track as everything is happening at once. And dont even try letting the AI take over your party cause its truly terrible at judging the right abilities to use and will rinse through them rapidly. Yes, they also have turn-based in there as an option and i must admit that at least they tried to do something different with combat,  but I just dont get why this is the one thing they seemed to alter and adapt for the video game but left everything else seemingly unchanged. Especially as this combat method is damn near unplayable.

I don't just want to focus on the negatives. As I say this game has a lot of promise; the story is cool, i love the variety of spells and all the customising you can do. I love that they implemented a base/kingdom building element, even if its broken.  The graphics are good, the variety of maps and areas are great. The huge number of characters and sub plots is also fantastic and of course the famous Pathfinder world and lore is wonderful to play through.

Its just such a shame that right now I find myself in yet another situation where I'm just deadlocked with this enemy who RNG has given this obscene advantage to, and theres nothing I can do to change it without going back about ten hours.

Only get this game if you love the genre and are extremely patient but otherwise I wouldn't recommend.",1627088575,1627089402,False,4,1,0.510877847671508789,0,True,False,False

Not only that, but I haven't really wasted any time in it either, aside from maybe a few hours creating/respecing characters. There's still several unfinished quests and I have yet to explore the majority of the locations on the map. If you have played things like Pillars of Eternity, then you know what you are getting into. What sets this game apart, and the reason it's so damn long, is that there is a kingdom management aspect that, while a bit shallow at times, is very addicting. 

The class and level system is one of my favorite parts of the game, and I'd place it among the best I've seen in an rpg; but it is very easy to make a very ineffective character- Which is bad because the game is hard. Like, too hard. Like, DM just got fired and their partner left them so they're going to take it out on the group kind of hard. Trust me, there is NO shame is lowering or tweaking the difficulty, because it is neither fair nor balanced. It might be forgivable if the encounter design were more interesting than wide open spaces where you are often surrounded and outnumbered. Playing turn-based definitely helps curb the challenge.

Eventually though, as is almost always the case in games, you will be over-powered (or in this context, appropriately-powered). That only applies to combat, however, and not to the ruling and leadership side of the game. You will constantly face trials that you are almost never prepared for. Decisions you make can lead to stability or anarchy, the latter of which can lead to a game over, which many have found out the hard way. Remember the golden rule of RPG's: SAVE OFTEN. 

I like the story because I'm a leader and I have to make important decisions, liken to a game such as Dragon Age Inquisition. Now, many of these are surface-level, but it's a role-playing game after all... A little imagination seasoning and the under-cooked chicken will taste just fine. Does it matter where I found settlements, what I build in them, who I send where? A little, but it's more than satisfactory. And having your alignment effect the world around you, even in a small way, is quite nice.

The companions are hit or miss, with few surprises, but they will grow on you if you don't just glaze over the walls of text that makes up the majority of their dialogue. Though I will say that what voice-acting their is actually quite excellent. And speaking of good sounds- I love the music in this game!

To conclude, this game does a lot and it does most of it very well. High marks for writing, environments, sound design and class development. Low marks for difficulty (non-issue if you tweak it), a few shallow role-playing elements and somewhat bland combat encounters.",1627076611,1627076611,True,1,0,0.501926779747009277,0,True,False,False

I'd never heard of the Pathfinder system or had any experience with the 3.5 DnD ruleset (as far as I'm aware), but I find the system in Pathfinder: Kingmaker very engaging and deep, and for the most part incredibly well explained (thanks largely to an excellent tooltip system). I did have to go to Google for some things but far less than for other similar titles. 

The battles feel savage, with meaty thwacks and slices complimented by an excellent fantasy RPG score that is among the best I've ever heard. The game also looks excellent; crumbling fog-wreathed temples in ancient forests, flashy spell effects, and enemies that occasionally explode into delightful showers of blood and viscera. Character models reflect all of their (up to 4) weapon sets simultaneously, which is something I hadn't seen before. My alchemist is modeled with a huge backpack of (presumably) potions and reagents, which I absolutely loved. I also really enjoyed the camping system, which felt like a nice hybrid of the old Baldur's Gate style ""press a button to recharge spells"" and the newer ""every night under the stars is a story"" Bioware camping style.

The story, unfortunately, is mediocre. I don't really have much to say about it so far, but there isn't much about the world or the main questline that I've found interesting. There seems to be an interesting array of gods, but the rest of the world seems bog standard. Maybe it's an issue of poor exposition. With a couple of exceptions the companions are also fairly dull; they typically appear out of nowhere and join your party for little or no reasons, and their backstories are hidden in text dumps you can read at camp.

I see a lot of people complaining about difficulty but I haven't hit that spike yet (besides getting demolished by ""swarm"" enemies, an unintuitive quirk of the Pathfinder system). Also a lot of enemies cause ridiculous amounts of attribute damage which early on in the game forces you to leave the dungeon and travel back to your base and rest many times consecutively (after taking 11 points of attribute damage I had to rest 7 times in a row to heal; it didn't make for engaging gameplay).

You'll get the most out of it that way.

The RPG and strategy layers dovetail nicely and realm management presents real stakes (those stakes can be toned down and even removed, but you're missing out on a major chunk of the experience if you turn off realm management).

Everything Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights did well, it does well, too, and then... stops there, pretty much. Overall I do like this game, and I would recommend it to anyone who is enthusiastic about cRPGs and the Pathfinder system/D&D 3.5, but be aware it does have some kinks as well as things that are not quite optimal. I am giving it a 'recommend' because it is an extremely average example of my favorite genre, but with some interesting strategy elements and writing quirks which keep me playing.

The good:
-Kingmaker is a very faithful adaptation of tabletop Pathfinder rules. You have to activate evasion before moving out of threat range to avoid taking an opportunity attack, for example. The character creation system is very in-depth and there are options in combat which you don't often see translated into computer versions of these systems (charge, demoralize). This makes battles challenging and quite in-depth.
-The writing is, AT POINTS, actually pretty interesting. While most cRPGs which use the D&D alignment system tend to emphasize the Good/Evil axis of the alignment system, Kingmaker, being a game about governance, usually emphasizes the Law/Chaos axis. I have never seen this before and it actually makes for some pretty interesting roleplaying re: dialogue options. It also mixes up interpersonal dynamics between your NPCs a bit. There are evil characters in this game which are actually sort of interesting, which I have rarely (if ever) seen in a game like this. 
-It's pretty. Seriously, it's one of the most visually appealing cRPGs I've played in a while. It looks good, it sounds good, it feels good. 
-Kingdom management is kind of fun. It's what I wanted from Pillars of Eternity's Caed Nua sideline, but never really got. It's a blend of adventuring RPG and, like... Total War's strategy map? I guess? You pick advisors and address stuff that happens in the kingdom, build cities, expand your land, fight wars. It's engaging, mostly.

The bad:
-The UI. I have played isometric cRPGs for 20 years and after 25 hours of this game I still occasionally click the wrong button. It doesn't explain how to get the game to do what you want it to do (and know it CAN do). Kingdom management is extremely unintuitive even to a veteran of grand strategy games, you receive basically no popups for anything, and occasionally you will lock in events which skip three weeks of game time without any warning whatsoever, causing you to miss vital emergencies going on elsewhere in the kingdom.
-The Pathfinder system is really badly explained. There are tutorials in this game for totally braindead things ('click to attack!') but literally nothing that tells you, for example, when it is possible to charge (by the way, you have to have your full round available and the path to your target needs to be clear). There is a complete dearth of informational tooltips for the Pathfinder system. I literally bought a Pathfinder rulebook and play with it on my desk so I can look stuff up quickly (""What does shaken do again? What is UP with this class?""). After doing this for a while, I can definitely say -- it almost seems like the game was DESIGNED with someone having the whole darned book either memorized or on their desk the entire time. It's super arcane. 
-The developers have no idea what game balance looks like for low level parties. I am, for example, fighting a group of wererats at level 4. All of these wererats have 26 AC, at a time in the game when my average to-hit modifier is +4. This means I either need to abuse VERY SPECIFIC spells or roll a 20 in order to even damage these things. For reference, in the actual book, wererats are CR2 and have an AC of 19, meaning I should be able to destroy them at level 4 no problem. I am not enthusiastic about fighting creatures that I SHOULD be able to to wipe the floor with and watching my battle-log scroll ""Miss! Miss! Miss!"". This is the third time this has happened. The balance is sideways as heck.
-As other reviewers have said, the writing is pretty flat aside from its unique take on Chaos/Law. There is a barbarian, who is a barbarian. There are no features to her personality beyond that. There is a nihilistic dwarf, who is a nihilist. There are no features to his personality beyond that. There is an elf, who is evil... and so on. There are a few companions which do have some nuance to their development (Regongar, Octavia, and Valerie come to mind), but even these are pretty thin.

The quest bugs seem (mostly) fixed and in my most recent playthrough I've encountered no issues that resulted in me having to reload or fail to complete a quest due to a bug.  With that in mind I'm changing my review to a strong recommend!

Previous review notes below for posterity:


I will probably come back to this game and change this to a thumbs up after a few patches, but in the current state this game plays like it's in Early Access not a full release.  The developers are making constant updates and reaching out for feedback to find bugs, which is nice, but, again, that's Early Access behavior.  I intentionally didn't buy this game until it was out of Early Access to avoid all the initial bugs but alas they still caught up with me.

The devs are definitely working their butts off to make things right and have been putting out hotfixes every 3 or so days, but they still have a ways to go and even admit they haven't had the bandwidth to focus on the major fixes they know exist.

For the first 3 chapters this game is pretty amazing.  I think it's one of (if not the) best videogame intepretations of a D&D ruleset.  Combat is fun, the class combinations are incredibly varied and the story was intriguing and kept me interested.

Past chapter 3, though, the bugs and issues start to get out of control.  I encountered numerous times where I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong/not looking in the right place and then come to find out there was a known bug.  There are events that are bugged and missable along with broken quests and the further along I got the more often I had question whether the game was buggy or if this was how it was supposed to be.

There are also timed quests, which, initially I was fine with as they show up in your quest journal, indicating the amount of time you have to complete which is usually more than enough time to complete and still explore a ton.  *But* after chapter 3 they thrown hidden timers at you and if you don't complete the quests on time it's game over (literally).  I have no problem with timers in general, but in previous chapters you knew about the deadline and could adjust (keep an earlier save) but with the hidden timers it is possible (and alll too common) to get in a situation where you can't complete the quest in time and even earlier saves are too far along - resulting in a permanent game over (and having to start completely over).

The time events and permanent game over combined with the current game state (bugs, etc.) lead me to not recommend this game.  Again, the devs are working to improve so I'll revisit in a month or so and I would definitely say this is a game to keep on your radar and get once everything is ironed out.",1539032548,1626823232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As such, I can't really put it up against the pen and paper version, only how it stacks up to my knowledge, expectations and other games in the genre. 

- [b] STORY [/b] -
Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a good game. But it's not a great game. While the story is alright, though at moments it looses steam or certain chapters over-stay their welcome, it still manages to get you somewhat involved and interested. Though the end villain is, in all honesty, a bit meh. Even when you get to the kingdom management part of the game, you still have larger threats or purposes that drive you and the narrative forward. At times the main story is at odds with the ""explore and adventure"" part of the game, where as you have time constraints placed upon you which forces you to do certain quests before you can go out and adventure. This is not a big issue since in all the cases I came across you can still just do the side quests afterwards, but it still pulls you out of the adventure aspect of the game and forces you onto a set path. It's sort of like going from a free-ride to being put on rails, the rails are fine and all, but that's not what you were doing right now. 

- [b] COMPANIONS [/b] -
Most companions are good, but they're marred down by cliché writing and force-fed stereotypes... or anti-stereotypes? You have the strong independant woman who was always looked down upon by men, you have the nonchalant cold-hearted one who does whatever to further their own gain and so forth. There were a couple that I found genuinely interesting, ironically Nok-Nok the goblin was one of them. But even he is the rather stereotypical ""non-human, uncivilized"" companion who thinks human customs are dumb. Overall, alright copmanions, but a bit hamfisted and cliché at times.

- [b] GAMEPLAY [/b] -
You can switch the gameplay between tactical and turn based, and of course all the dice rolls are done behind the scenes. This is not new or revolutionary, but it doesn't have to be. It gets the job done very well, and if you know more about the pathfinder ruleset than I do, you'll do a lot better in the combat as well. The rest of the gameplay loop is caring for your kingdom (barony) sending your advisors out on missions and upgrading/building things in your villages and towns. Looting and equipping your character is fairly standard D&D affair, nobody will be surprised there.

- [b] GRAPHICS [/b] -
The graphics are pretty good, the last cRPG I played was probably Pillars of Eternity II and this is better graphically looking than that game, but not by a whole lot. Environments and nature also look good, with nothing that sticks terribly out of place, so everything is keeping within the world's aesthetics. It should be noted here that you can NOT rotate the camera in the game. This feels kind of odd to me, but it rarely becomes a problem since they've designed the levels with this in mind. Should have probably put that last bit under gameplay.

- [b] AUDIO/MUSIC [/b] -
Music is pretty mediocre, there's a piece here and there that stands out but overall it just manages to do the job. The audio however is generally pretty good. Attacking in melee sounds meaty and chunky, and spell effects are well-made. In terms of Ambience or atmosphere, there isn't overly much, though when there's a proper storm (which comes with its own stat debuffs for your party, by the way) it really does feel like a storm.

- [b] Performance [/b] - 
The game has performed well on my system, I'm running a bit of an older CPU, a Ryxen 1600X with a 2080 TI and 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM. I know, I know, I'm going to upgrade my CPU soon. There were occasional moments with a lot of units on screen as well as with a lot of effects where I did lose frames, but it was still at a playable level. It seems that light sources and effects has the biggest impact on your performance. Overall, it runs fine.

[b] NITPICKS [/b]
* Travelling on the world map can take a long ass time when going far away. This makes logical sense, of course, but when you've done most of what there is to do, and you just want to finish up some side-quests, it's annoying that it takes 5-10 minutes to go from your capital to your quest location. This can take even longer when you get interrupted by random monsters on the road that will drag you into a combat scenario. This is a nitpick for when you've done most of the game though, since before that you have all the juicy exploration to do and things feel new and fresh.

* There's not really much happening in your capital after you've gone through the main quest-line. There aren't many interesting characters, there are as far as I'm aware, no random events at all, and you'll never ever use it except to visit your merchants or the local cleric to buy restoration scrolls or other divination items.

* There is no crafting in the game at all, if you don't count the different ""foods"" you can make while resting your party. This is not a huge deal, but it feels weird to not have any crafting at all when it could've added much to the game.

* Any item you find is yours to pick up. There is no stealing, from anyone. Sometimes an item will have a trigger attached to it, like if you pick up something it'll spawn an enemy, but no stealing. Which means if you want to RP as a thief/rogue? You're pretty much out of luck.

* When traveling, your companions and your character will become fatigued and eventually exhausted. You have to either camp and use rations/go hunting to get rid of this debuff, or if you're fatigued you can use restoration scrolls to get rid of fatigue. However, if you are INSIDE, like a dungeon or cave, you have to use rations. The only issue with this is, you can be an hour or two, or three, into a grueling dungeon and either run out of rations, or not have enough from the beginning, to rest and recover your skills/spells. Leaving you vulnerable and essentially useless. This happened to me at one point in the main story and I couldn't go outside of the dungeon because there was a VERY tough encounter outside waiting for me, since I got inside the dungeon on, let's say, friendly terms. Now I know, I should've brought more supplies, but supplies weigh a fair bit in the game, and if you have just ONE supply too little to rest, nobody in your party will get anything. A good solution to this, in my opinion, would be so you can choose who gets the rations when you rest in a dungeon. Your fighter or barbarian might not need to recover their skills, but your spell-casters definitely might.

FINAL VERDICT:
I'll give Pathfinder: Kingmaker a solid 7, depending on my mood it might go down to a weak 7. It's definitely worth a try if you're into the cRPG genre, and even if you're not, it might be worth picking up on a sale!",1626801267,1626801267,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

FANTASTICALLY COMPLEX AND MORALLY BRANCHING STORY - some reviewers obviously don't have the mental or emotional capacity to see how uniquely fresh and amazing it is that you can either dominate once powerful enemies like a badass sith lord or redeem them to your cause and the redemption of the Stolen Lands....or kill them, kill them all (though isnt violence really the tiresome cliche?) I mean what other game explores and unpicks complex human compunctions and morality in a way that allows and secretly encourages peace and redemption in a game that's very construct revolves around combat encounters? Words have the greatest power in this game as you may find out, or not. 
THE SECRET ENDING is extremely challenging to achieve and best endings for all characters will take over 100 hours to complete. But boy the satisfaction! How easy it is to sow evil; and how hard it is to hope and love your enemies as well as your friends. And yet in that hope and love can you find the power to conquer all evil. As someone who suffers daily from a disability, a ""curse"" if you will from people in my past, this SECRET ENDING really touched me. Whats more the SECRET ENDING is hinted at and teased all the way through the game so much so that there are at least 2 points in the game where the level design / puzzle  (which becomes inverted, so you do the level 1 way, then later do it again inverted) becomes a threefold allegory for: the wider story, a certain character and the ""moral"" if you will, of the story. When you see all what you have done throughout the game it all begins to click and every odd encounter turns in to an ""ahhhhh"" moment. Honestly, its superb craft! 

FANTASTIC MAGIC AND EFFECTS - You can literally turn into a dragon or elder elemental, turn others into puppies or spit lightning and cackle the way daddy Palpatine knows best.

CLICHED CHARACTERS YES BUT - There is something very charming and funny in the way they did it, just play it and see. These characters are designed to support the story not the other way around like other games. But remember what this game is about. Story - and the agency of that story is you. You begin with nothing lvl 1, you are scorned and betrayed; you end with an empire of adoring/fearful citizens lvl20.

one of the most diverse and flexible character building system in all CRPG
complex game mechanics
combat is challenging if you spent the time to learn the system, if you don't then its only playable in lower if not lowest difficulty setting. 
little to no bug
longest game time out of all CRPG i have played, 300 hours just for 1 play through. 

cons: 
needlessly complicated basic concept: attack bonus = accuracy, armour class = dodge, difficult class = spell dodge, this is a game you have to play with a wiki page open at all time. my first 200 hours were played with constant questions. 
bare bone tutorial
stubbornly stick to the table top's dice roll when something is best left to be calculated by computer. like hit chance. 
the game really should be designed as a primary turn base game. (vs rtwp and turn base as a second thought). currently rtwp is impossible to manage when you have a few casting class and it all just a hot mess during combat. some of the precise control granted by quicken/move action are impossible to be utilised fully.

But will I still buy it again? 100%, but it is definitely not for everyone. if 50% of the game time is spent on reading wiki page is not your jam. dodge this game, or expecting a confusing and mediocre gaming experience.

- Game is very long. Completed it 2 times and each run took me around 80 hours. 
- A lot of classes etc. you have a lot to choose from and it makes you to do multiple playthroughs. At start you can feel overwhelmed but rest easy, you can still choose standard (easier) ones like warrior, mage, priest etc. 
- The game is pretty hard. The creators made it much easier after adding turn-based combat (IN FREE UPDATE, NICE) but I think the difficulty of it lies in a bad tutorial for new players and how the game teaches you about mechanics of combat. 
- The world's map is pretty big and you have a lot of different environments like forests, deserts, caves, mountains with a lot of snow etc. 
- While traveling you have to take care of maintaining your companions, setting camps, buying supplies, encountering bandits, monsters etc. For example while traveling you can encounter a side quest that normally you wouldn't encounter. It makes the world feel truly alive. 
- Companions are greatly written with their own stories, sidequests, characters. They often talk, joke and quarrel between each other. Creators truly made them feel real to you to the point where you start worrying about them, making sure they stay alive to the end of your quest. Yes, all of your companions can die forever when you either use game settings or make a mistake in the story. They will also react differently to your choices and some of them can leave you.
- There is ROMANCE. Yes, you can start relationships with your companions and I am not talking about something stupidly written for people to enjoy but about true relationships that reminded me of the ones in Baldurs Gate 2.
- The game doesn't tell you it at start but most of the main quests have time limit. If you don't do them there will be grave consequences. One of them can even result in complete game over after 40-50 hours of playtime. I would truly recommend checking on the uncle google which quests are on time limit to not make my mistake where I had to reload a save and lost 5-10 hours of progress.
- Kingdom management is fun. During the game you have your own kingdom, you can buy new lands, make towns, build structures inside cities, invite craftsmans and make them make new stuff for you, employ advisors and ministers, send your companions on quests. During some of the missions you can save or spare characters and employ them etc. It makes you feel like a true ruler that has to make tough choices.

As a Player of the PnP Pathfinder (Quite popular here in Germany) I had the feeling that finishing the game on Unfair would be just fine. The game was absolutely brutal. But it was also alot of fun. Some stuff is missing from the PnP but nothing really that major as to not like the game for it or anything like that. The story was quite refreshing when I could have at long last concentrate on it and not on realoading old saves to revert some bug. For goodness sake that issue is long gone... There is a couple of issues with the game like the fact that if you have multiple save files the game starts to be laggy and slows down... I did not want to delete saves outright with how buggy it was in the past since I was afraid to loose too much progress but luckily there was no major issue. Another issue the game has on 3080TI card is that for some reason it laggs a bit when enemies hold too many torches? But when you hold them it is alright? The music in the game was beutifull and the implemented mechanics are great. Even though the fact that you do not see every roll happen makes it look like you fail more stuff then you succeeed since the game likes to tell you if you fail something but not if you succeed, unless it happens in a conversation. Another Issue I had with the game was, and I thought it is because I played it on unfair where enemise at the end game had roughly 60AC, that the difficulty seems a bit unbalanced. In PNP you have a GM and the CR of encounters is most of the time done acurately quite well. But this game really likes to spike Avarage CR and Epic CR right next to each other.. That means CR for APL0 right next to APL+3 encounters or even higher making the game feel unfair at times, no pun intended. So you can litteraly fight APL0 on a map like some werewolves and wolves.
and then enter an area right above with an encounter that would be like APL+9 or some crap like that.. Another good example is the resting system. Where instead of the game rolling for when you notice enemies it more like rolls if you notice them at all basically making them all invisible unless you notice them. SO you either start a resting encounter with enemies far away from you with the correct CR or you suddenly start an encounter with Monsters standing directly on your sleeping face with nobody noticing anything at all.. 

Pros:
So from me, great game nicely implemented combat mechanics, well implemented UI. Beautiful music and engaging story. A lot of replay-ability. Nice graphics, smooth controls. You decisions matter from the get go. 

Cons: 
Horrible CR design rolling a DICE for the CR encounter making it possible to encounter epic level CR while traveling the world feels awkward. ""You travel a forrest with you friends and suddenly: 4 Greater Ancient Fire elementals fall from the sky on your low level party."" - What the hell? 
The game was not buggy on realease. it was more like there was some game hidden in all of the buggy code.. Luckily that was fixed as it seems now.

Since the game was extremely buggy I did not recommend to buy it.. Now that it is mostly fixed I changed the recommendation. Old Review bellow.

[i]So After about a Year I have made the decission to come back to the game. My first opinion was drasticaly souered after facing multiple game breaking bugs. Some of which were so bad they litteraly forced you to restart the whole campaign from start. The reason I have played so many hours is not that I enjoiyed the game so much but more because of my own stubbornes trying to not give up on the game and finish it.. I have had to restart the game 3 times. I will describe the buggs bellow because they containt some spoilers. Saddly I have to say even after coming back to the game, giving the developers extra time to fix and finish the game I HAVE STILL ENCOUNTERED A GAME BREAKING BUG WHICH FORCES ME TO RESTART THE CAMPAIGN... I am no joking after a year of fixing there is STILL a game breaking bug and it forces me to restart the campaign anew... EVEN NOW!!!! 

So as you can immagine I have to say I do NOT recommend this game. The developers already started to develop a new game and yet the game is STILL riddled with bugs even after such a long time.. This is just incredible. 

The first bug I encountered was that even after giving Jaethal up to the law and letting her die, She showed up later on in the game killed Tristian and then just vanished from the game.. Then the cinematic that showed her killing Tristian just did not end and I was stuck in it.. As you can see this is a problem because there was nothing I could do with a decision I have made about 100 hours prior. 

Second game breaking bug I encountered was that some areas need to progress in the main quest never showed up. Like the Stag Lords fort. I know what I have to do and whome to talk to to trigger the fog from despawning, but it simply did not work.. The quest log told me that I know where the area is and I could see the icon on the map but since the Fog was still there I could not enter the area.. 

Another game breaking bug was that Tsanna never showed up by the Shrine of lamashtu at the end of the game, instead the map was empty only telling me to talk to her.. She never spawned no matter what I did.. I was even able to go back about 150 hours and replay the whole part and even though I had no issues she simply did not spawn and since you will get a quest to save her (of course if you made the decision that she should join you, which I did) the game would not contionue on. 


And now after a year when I entered the area of the Abandoned hut to talk to the Nymph, she told me to search the area around the hut and report to her my findings, The game then prompted me to another conversation with her to talk over my findings which I did and the quest finished with showing me where to go next. But when I left the abandoned hut the quest reseted and I had to again go back to the abandoned hut and search the area around the hut. I loaded the previous save and it worked a bit.. I searched the area talked it over with the Nymph quest completed and send me on, but again when I left the area the quest reseted again.... 

I can say only 3 words....

After playing through Baldur’s Gate, Pillars of Eternity and the like I was hoping for a similar experience in Pathfinder Kingmaker, and to a certain extent it delivered. The free to explore nature of the world map, fairly in-depth character building/customisation and a cast of varied companions with the option of creating custom ones seemed right up my alley. The main issue for me was game’s overall quality of writing. Its serviceable and I wouldn’t call it bad per se, I just felt terribly unengaged for the majority of my playtime and kept waiting for it to either pick up or get better. I found the premise to be dull and many events and characters often felt too surface level, especially for a game where you play as a ruler of a newly subjugated piece of land. There’s opportunity here to tell stories with elements of politicking and intrigue, dealing with neighbours and legitimising your rule or such. Instead, it’s mostly about being an adventurer like any other game that happens to go sit on a throne every now and then. There’s a general feeling of a lack of agency in regards to the main plot and interactions with most characters, with the exception of maybe a secret ending which requires certain requirements to be fulfilled throughout the entire campaign. 
     
     On some occasions where an interesting choice did present itself, it may be locked behind an alignment specific to the PC (for instance a decision regarding the antagonist in the Varnhold chapter). I’m not a fan of classic tabletop alignments personally, but I find them even more pointlessly restricting when they straight up limit my options due to some arbitrary moral compass I selected in character creation. The issues I have with the writing extend to the companions where I find them a mixed bag, with some interesting ones and others being fairly dull and surface level. And as the game dragged on (my final save ended up being around 110 hours I think) I started to care less and less about them (except for maybe Nok Nok, I mean who can say no to that smile). I will say that I do like how the companion quests are split into multiple ‘individual quests’ that become available as the main story is progressed, rather than being an ‘one and done’ affair. I feel like it is also worth pointing out that a companion (Jubilost) just straight up did not spawn in my playthrough, as far as I can tell because I explored a location before his scripted appearance, so that was great. 
	
      Now despite my grievances with the writing there is still a lot of fun to be had with Kingmaker. The overall presentation is excellent with enjoyable music and stellar feedback in combat. Kingdom management is a bit plain but for a side activity to pass the time with its alright. Some enemy encounters felt interesting to approach, and due to the fantastic sound and visual design; spells and simple weapon attacks feel both satisfying to use and watch. Combined with the intricate class and multiclass system of Pathfinder, combat became my main source of enjoyment and was surprisingly the part I kept looking forward to. That is however, discounting the fact that so many encounters felt cheap with enemies appearing out of thin air and assaulting your backline like its Dragon Age 2. And none of it comes close to the final portion of the game which I found endlessly tedious and frustrating. With hordes of hard hitting and uncharacteristically hard to hit enemies, I eventually gave up after what felt like banging my head on a wall and lowered the difficulty (which, to the game’s credit is extremely customisable). It was at this point where I came to the conclusion that I may been the wrong audience for this game, after all, it is meant to be a faithful recreation and adaptation of tabletop system that I could not care less about (did healing potions really need to be a dice roll??). Looking at it from this perspective Kingmaker probably succeeded in what it sets out to do, and if you are the target audience ie. looking for a game that uses the Pathfinder ruleset and setting I believe you might get some value out of this game. Baldur’s Gate also had similar aspirations, and although I may have had some complaints with that game’s mechanics (the hells a THAC0 anyway), I found myself enjoying those games a lot more due to the interesting stories and characters it presented. 
	
      I guess it depends entirely on what you look for and value more in an RPG such as this. I find my personal enjoyment to primarily hinged on whether or not I am invested in the set pieces that are presented to me, but if you couldn’t care less about that there is certainly enough ‘game’ in Pathfinder: Kingmaker to have a good time. I certainly do not regret playing Kingmaker, but I did get a lot less out of it than I had hoped. All things considered though, as Owlcat’s first game they certainly did a fantastic job, especially considering the difficulties of making an RPG of this scope.

First you got the CRPG stuff, which while its pretty bread and butter there's a lot of stuff to mess around with in terms of character races, classes and subclasses, and feats. You can mess around with whatever party combo you want to run with, even a full squad of custom mercenary characters if you feel like it. You can even customize what the default formation your team uses as you wander around the countryside murdering bandits. Gameplay wise you can play with real time with pause (as God intended) like other CRPGs, but you can ALSO swap to turn based combat if you want, and you can even switch over whenever you feel like it, which is pretty rad, though I never used the turn based mode its nice that its there if that's how you want to play.

The plot starts out with you, murder hobo protagonist, being offered a job by some rich dudes telling you to kill some gang leader who strong armed the locals out in unclaimed territory within a set amount of time, with the reward being YOU get to run the place. Avoiding the big story spoilers, once YOU'RE the one who strong armed themselves into a position of authority, you need to balance between running around doing RPG stuff, and managing your territory, which is where the second half of the game kicks in. Problems pop up that you personally cant run over and punch in the face, like tax loopholes, or negotiating trade deals with your neighbors. These problems you leave to your advisors, people from your court that you assign to positions to deal with those problems. Got crime? Have the Warden handle it. Got magic stuff you need to figure out? That's the Magisters job. You tell them to handle something, and they go to it, taking time and usually rolling the dice to see if they pull it off or blow it completely. There kingdom stats, an advisor to go with each one, and ranks determining how good your dice rolls are.

On top of regular issues, your advisors will come up to you for your input on situations as they rank up, some of them are kind of meh (Two villagers are claiming the same cow, what do you do??) but some of them are nuts (UH OH WE GOT CULTS, WHAT DO WE DO??), with your advisor giving a recommendation but letting you choose what you think is best. Each advisor has their own opinions and way of doing things, which effects how they handle things, and if you ignore their advice too much they say ""Well whats the point?"" and leave, so its best if you get people who would do things like you do in those positions. There's more to running things than that though, you can also build towns in your territory, which is detailed down to the point to slapping down individual buildings on a small grid. There's even bonuses for placing certain buildings next to each other. Then there's special projects that each region can get on top of that.

Plot wise, you go from crisis to crisis dealing with things that want to make the little country you've made collapse, which each big chunk of the game centering around some existential crisis where if you don't fix it everything will slowly fall apart. These problems are actually pretty varied, even if eventually in true CRPG fashion you have to handle it yourself by stabbing it really hard. There's a lot of game in here, my play time was over a hundred hours and I imagine the first run of most first time players would also break the hundred hour mark.

There's enough distinction between good, evil and neutral, and lawful and chaotic playthroughs that you can replay the game and see plenty of things and handle problems in new ways you couldn't before. New options in dialog, new characters to recruit for your court, new item effects, even cosmetic stuff in your capital

It has it's problems, not gonna lie, there's kinks that weren't worked out like not being able to handle major story events that pop up if you're in the middle of ranking someone up, kingdom management problems repeating because they didn't have enough unique ones to fill out the time between chapters.

The game uses the Pathfinder system, and while it can be enjoyable, there's certainly alot of things that could have been adapted for a better experience. The devs weirdly tried to keep the system as close to the pen and paper version as possible.

For reference, I only played on the Turn-based option because I do not like RTwP.

My first attempt to play through the game, I got about 40 hours in. Got bogged down by the barony management system, got frustrated with the ""gotcha!"" encounter design. Generally had a rough time of it. 

Tried again, this time focusing on getting through the early game as quickly as possible (as I now knew where the pitfalls were) and for a solid 40 hours I had an okay-ish time. But shortly after a slog through chapter 3, I realised I've basically seen everything this game had to offer. 

The worst parts:
• [b]vague quests[/b]
Some quests you need to get to a place immediately, others you have to literally just wait until the game updates. The game does not tell you which is which in a meaningful way. Additionally, there are skill checks that are completely random. My rogue with +30 in the Trickery stat regularly failed lockpicking. The game does not show you the roll. It also does not let you retry until you level up again.

• [b]encounters which had every single enemy get a free shot on my party before the fight started[/b]
Initiative order does not matter when enemies appear out of nowhere and hit your team with AOE attacks before Initiative is even rolled. This is rubbish encounter design that basically forces you to save every couple of minutes. Either that, having an area with level 5 bears and worgs, only to have a cave with a level 16 dragon randomly for my party to get TPK'd in. It feels like the combat was designed by the most neck-beard DM ever, who actively [i]hates[/i] you.

• [b]the game has no respect for your time[/b]
Unskippable ""cutscenes"" of NPCs silently emoting while text floats over their heads. Achingly slow travel time. No option to move faster out of combat. Lockpicking that, should you fail, you need to level up to try again. Encumbrance rules that block you from travelling. Every time you Rest, which is often because the world map puts things DAYS away from your main hub, you sit through a conversation between two party members, then a interface that slowly goes through the successes of each action, THEN decides if you get attacked randomly, etc.

And all of this would have been bearable had it not been for the truly rubbish writing. Some of the dialogue is so bad, I'm convinced that the writers have never had a conversation with another person on equal terms. It's not even the cliché story beats, it's that there is no nuance to the ""choices"" you're given.

At one point, there are two separate crisis things I need to deal with. Because I didn't play a Lawful Good character, the option to tell my clearly unequipped underling to go deal with the attack on the capital was not available to me. He just flat-out refuses. So I need to trek 18 hours back, deal with the capital attack, then travel 2 days to get where he is only to see him die because of course he did.

Other times, you're meeting a new person and the options for dialogue are:

[i]1. Who are you?[/i]
[i]2. Where do you come from?[/i]
[i]3. [Chaotic Evil] [Attack] Die, you worthless scumbag![/i]
[i]4. I have to go[/i]

I really wanted to like this game. The art is great and the combat mechanics are pretty neat. I just could not force myself to carry on anymore after one-too-many setbacks to my progress.

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is an isometric cRPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe. The player takes control of an adventurer and their group of companions, trying to establish a kingdom in the Stolen Lands.

Let's start with the most important – Pathfinder: Kingmaker uses the Pathfinder ruleset, which is a modification of 3.5 D&D. On one hand, the rules are well implemented and in many regards the game emulates the tabletop experience very nicely. On the other hand though, if you're not familiar with the rules, you're going to have a hard time. Before starting the game, I'd had to do a lot of research just to understand the character creation. What doesn't help is that the game isn't exactly easy, even on the Normal difficulty, so optimising your characters is more important than in other cRPGs. Same goes for combat – while there are a lot of encounters which you can just rush through, many of them, especially early on and then in the late game, require you to understand the mechanics, otherwise you'll be having a bad time. Although the game provides some explanations, many of them are incomplete, misleading, or outright missing.

The majority of the game is standard (c)RPG – you and your party go around the map, solve quests, explore various locations and fight enemies (or persuade them not to fight you). The combat unsurprisingly uses Pathfinder rules and can be either in Real Time with Pause or Turn-Based, but unlike  for example Pillars of Eternity 2, you can switch between these two modes at will, which is a thing I just can't appreciate enough. Regarding the location and encounter design, I sadly feel that the devs have chosen quantity over quality. The number of locations is really high, but a lot of them are just copypasted versions of the other ones and in result don't feel as unique (also, the maps of the individual locations are rather small). Same goes for the combat encounters – while there are some really nice and clever ones, most of them (especially towards the end of the game) consist of waves upon waves of same-ish enemies. That unfortunately kinda sucked the fun out of the gameplay for me. I really would have enjoyed it more if the game had less encounters and locations in total, with more unique ones among them. 

As for the other gameplay aspects, a lot of the game consists of dice roll checks. That wouldn't be necessarily bad, as it is a crucial part of any D&D campaign, but Kingmaker sadly acts like an unfriendly dungeon master. Failing a check in this game really isn't as fun as passing it, because often you hit a wall just because of a failed roll. Sometimes those walls are just chests you can't unlock (you can actually try after you level up, but who has the time for that), other times you can't continue through a conversation, or miss a hidden area with important items. Also, a lot of the checks are hidden, meaning if you fail them you won't know that you had the chance to make some things differently (and again, some of these are quite important). Talking about this, there is also a lot of permanently missable stuff, including [spoiler] 3 companions (with one of them being extremely useful, but also extremely easy to miss). [/spoiler]

Apart from the regular cRPG gameplay, Pathfinder: Kingmaker also includes kingdom management, meaning once you found your country, you have to take care of it. Although this may sound good, in reality it was just bothersome. The management aspect isn't complex or deep enough to be fun, but if you ignore it it can actually cause a game over. It consists of two types of activities – buildin villages and towns (which is almost completely pointless except for a few good buildings) and solving events. These come in form of a short description, telling you what is happening and what needs to be done; you deal with them via a d20 check. The majority of events aren't tied to the story in any way and are actually randomized. There's also a limited number of them, meaning about halfway through the game you begin to encounter ones you've already seen. Count in the fact that failing enough 'problem' events will destroy your kingdom so a series of unlucky dice rolls can lead to a game over, especially in the early game. Fortunately you have the ability to tone down the kingdom management difficulty regardless of the difficulty of the rest of the game. Nevertheless, there wasn't anything I particularly enjoyed about this part of Kingmaker.

The story is good, just that. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to keep you entertained and wondering what comes next. It consists of several chapters and, what's neat, it really nicely escalates, so you really want to see more and eagerly await the finale. There are some twists, many of them quite obvious, but also surprising ones. As for the writing itself, that's kind of a mixed bag for me. Some of the characters, be it companions, villains or regular NPCs, are really well written and interesting, others are rather dull and rely on clichés. I actually feel the same about the voice acting. On some occasions it just clicks and really enhances the character, while sometimes it isn't that good up to the point I would consider it a bit cringe. Speaking of voice acting, I can't leave out the fact that not all lines are voice acted (I actually think that the ones that are form a minority), but that wasn't really a problem, at least for me.

The soundtrack is also quite nice, featuring tracks composed by Inon Zur himself. With that being said, they start to feel repetitive after a while, mainly because the game is so long (more on that later) that you get to hear each of them at least a hundred times (I'm not exaggerating), which leads to them going from nice to annoying.

Now to the technical details – the graphics are good, having a bit different style than for example Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's gate, and not demanding (it's an isometric RPG after all), although I experienced some FPS drops without any obvious reason. What bothered me more is that I encountered quite a lot of bugs, especially with the Turn-Based mode and music. None of them were exactly gamebreaking, but all of them were very annoying, simply because how often they happened. I know that Kingmaker is a Kickstarted game and that the state was much worse when the game released, but still, I feel like a version that calls itself the 'Enhanced Plus Edition' shouldn't have that many glitches.

The final thing I'd like to write about is the length of the game. Seriously, Kingmaker is one of the longest games I've ever played (probably the longest now that I think of it), taking circa 180 hours. The upside to this is that it really does justice to the scale of the story (which spans several years) and the size of the world (for illustration – I played the game from March to July, so at the end it felt like the story truly began a long time ago). On the other hand, many of the games problems – mainly the repetitive encounters, annoying kingdom management and sometimes not-so-great writing – manifest themselves even more this way. As I've said before, the story is good enough to keep you hooked, but even the greatest things become boring when repeated long enough, especially when coupled with the repetitive encounter and location design. The extreme length also means that once you make a decision, you won't be able to take it back, since reloading after you see its consequence would mean losing easily ten hours of progress (sometimes even more).

Despite all its shortcomings, I must say that I've enjoyed Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The devs tried to do some things differently, which, in the end, has both its good and bad aspects; every hour of fun I 've had was paid with equal amount of frustration. I'm giving Kingmaker a 7/10 and looking forward to Wrath of the Righteous.",1626359724,1626359724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my case, I think Pillars of Eternity (and its sequel) simply set the bar too high for me, making Pathfinder: Kingmaker's flaws (in writing and in combat) all the more glaring and harder to ignore. 

For those who crave another cRPG with a lot of content, and believe they can look past these flaws, this review is worth little to you, and you are better off looking at other reviews in regard to this game. But for those of you who enjoyed Pillars of Eternity, and are specifically looking for something to play while waiting for the next cRPG from Obsidian Entertainment, Pathfinder: Kingmaker will probably disappoint you greatly, as it did to me.

Full Review:
I honestly tried to go further in the game. Hell, as someone who loves both traditional cRPGs such as Pillars of Eternity and roleplaying strategy games such as Crusader Kings II and III, the setting felt like it was perfectly tailored for me. But after seeing what the game had to offer after you 'claimed your kingdom', I really couldn't keep going.

The Writing: 
As others have mentioned, the writing is not the best. Some of the dialogues felt very cliche, as does the plot points that I have experienced so far. In addition, most of the companions are very one-dimensional, Barbarian is barbarian from barbarian land, evil guy acts cartoonishly 'not evil' only to be evil, to the surprise of no one, etc. Having said that, there were character traits that piqued my interest despite their flaws, with character such as Valerie and and Harrim's backstory and current circumstances making me want to learn more about them and see where their roads will take them, but that brings us to the second major issue with the game: the Combat.

The Combat:
To preface, I did not play much RTwP cRPGs in the past. As someone who was introduced to cRPGs with turn based combat in the past (even before PoE), it was difficult for me to adapt and play RTwP cRPGs. Slightly off topic, its worth mentioning that despite PoE1 being RTwP only, I was able to get through it by turning the difficulty down mid way and playing through the whole game when it got tedious. Thankfully, this game has a turn based system, so in comparison to PoE1, all should be well, right? 

Well, no, because the game also has many, MANY encounters across its maps. Playing on the normal difficulty, encounters were still difficult enough that after a few of them, you have to rest in order to move on (or risk TPK if you run into a particularly tedious one). As a result, clearing through an area became very time consuming, being a cycle of winning a few fights, resting (and hopefully not getting ambushed), and then exploring another few inches of the map. The fact that combat was very boring at the beginning (it apparently improves later, or so Im told) also didnt help, as each fight devolved to 'who can get to the opponent's backline first and kill all their CCers'. In addition, other than my spellcasters and their somewhat meager collection of spells, my melee characters have literally no moves other than 'charge' (and some mutually exclusive stances) at level 5. 

Now, of course, this game is based heavily on DnD Pathfinder, and while I haven't personally played Pathfinder TRPG, I assume that the game is faithful to the rules. The issue is that when said rulesets are digitized in this game, the fact that the DM plays a role in bringing the combat ruleset to life seems to have been lost in translation. This can be seen in the severe lack of skills mentioned above.

In addition, most, if not all of the encounters I have encountered thus far (no pun intended) were annoying, tedious, or a combination of both. They were very unremarkable, with the only fight that I can recall right now being that versus the Stag Lord, and even then, it is only due to the fact that I cheesed him by sneaking my entire party up to the platform he jumps to and OTK-ing him. So, combine this with the fact that your party members have little to no variety in how fights are approached, encounters very quickly became a slog that you must wade through in order to get to the actual 'meat' of the game (i.e. the writing, or the next story point, etc.)

Conclusion:
With these two primary issues combined, I couldn't make myself continue playing the game after around the 14 hour mark. Not only was the story and writing predictable and somewhat cliched, the game was a chore to get through, as a result of the overly abundant encounters that are, in most cases, very unsatisfying to take part in. While I appreciate the fact that the devs included a Turn Based Combat mode for outliers such as myself to be able to enjoy their game without being forced into RTwP, the fact that I was able to finish PoE1 DESPITE it being only RTwP highlights just how high of a bar PoE had set for cRPG (at least for me). Or, from a different perspective, how poorly executed Pathfinder: Kingmaker is in comparison to PoE 1 and its sequel.",1626031831,1626032585,False,2,0,0.497925341129302979,1,True,False,False

Basically everything is simulated dice rolls, meaning a combat can be trivial or impossible based on luck. Beyond that its balanced for ttrpgs where creative un-thought of solutions are encouraged but not possible in a computer rpg.  Either high investment character options like Wand Wielder for the magus are bugged, or have such a weird interface way of activiting that I have given up on figuring it out. 


I love Pathfinder but the controls are badly explained, the bugs oh my god the bugs. If you are a fan of Pathfinder it might be worth it, I got it on sale and every fight I am googling for a bug or to understand a wonky control mechanic. 

For example had a healer somehow cast cure light wounds but did not deliver it in one encounter.

+ Interesting setting.
+ Good sense of humour.
+ Good balance of drama & humour.
+ Well-written.

+ Good art direction.

Cons:

Also liked the way they handled alignment: you can slightly change it by your decisions, though some of the decision-alignment pairs seemed a bit off. The kingdom management feels a bit lacking, but it's alright, I suppose; you still get to feel like you are somehow influencing the world.

Pros
 - The story isn't bad, some of the non party NPC's are likeable, the party ones are mostly terrible.
 - The kingdom management is fun if they actually linked it mechanically to the rest of the game better.
 - They patched in an option to make it turn based, and therefore playable.

Cons
 - It lacks even all the content of the standard pathfinder core book

- The kingdom management while superficially fun has all the depth of a puddle, while it's kinda nice to build your towns and villages they benefits are not really worth your time, with the exception of Teleport circles to get around faster and bulletin boards (which are only available to Lawful characters) (yes that is correct non lawful characters have not discovered post-it note technology) every other building might give you some minor bonuses to 1 or 2 stats a +1 with an additional +1 if next to another certain type of building. Each mission your advisors do (and there are 8 advisors and each mission is 7-14 in game days which is not very long) boosts the kingdoms stats by at least as much usually more, frequently over double.

 - Summons everything summons always summons, combat quickly devolves into a minion slog fest, if you've ever played the table top game and been in a party with someone who summons 5+ creatures and whose turn is longer than the rest of the party combined, it's basically that in every fight, sometimes for multiple characters. For example in a companion quest in a temple of Shelyn the paladins decide to kill the priests (yeah I know please note not under mind control just annoyed.....) the priests....f**king all of them spend turn 1 summoning a direwolf each, turn 2 summoning 1D3 wolves each......30+ NPC creatures and 15 mins later........

 - Some areas are just a grind, looking at you entire chapter where 90% of the enemies have a 20% miss chance.....that seems closer to 40%.

 - On the subject of summons combat can be so glitchy that I had a fight with bandits, before moving on I found one bandit who hadn't joined the fight and spent the entire time summoning wolves, by the time I found him there were 15+ wolves an one guy in the middle frantically summoning more.

 - Ever heard the phrase ""don't split the party"" well it's good advice, shame the game literally forces you to do so.

 - Cringefest quest from a kickstarter backer who Gary Stu'd his own OC (do not steal) into the game, google Darven quest line and you'll fine plenty of people who were equally baffled that the kickstarter rewards lack any quality control.

 - If you let the NPC's level up automatically they make completely worthless builds.

 - Personally I pretty much hated all the NPC characters that make up your party. They can be summed up as such, Tower shield fighter who is a miserable asshat, barbarian wielding the oversized anime sword, literally every gruff stereotype (yes I know she's an ""iconic"" character, shes also hot garbage) a cheerful halfling who'se pretty much fine, an autistic savant gnome, an edgelord undead elf, a dwarf with crippling depression, a polyamorus and racially and alignmently diverse couple (CG half elf, CE half orc) both as fun to deal with as you'd expect but at least they kept the bench warm, oh and a lone wolf ranger complete with taciturnity and tragic backstory. If I left any of them out it's because they were probably completely forgettable. It's a shame that the story itself isn't bad but the characters feel very much the the 1st draft of a game on roll20 that everyone quit after session 1.

- Oh an a couple more that I remember after originally posting this, enjoy about 2 hours in a campsite (that for the record has bodies strewn about and looks dangerous) that you can rest at if you do it summons a monster about 9-10 levels higher than you, that you might not be able to damage and will 1 shot characters each round, also enjoy the fact if you weren't sensible and saved often that it autosaves and soft locks your autosave when you rest and therefore may soft lock your game.
 - This game feels just really save scummy in general like the worst elements of Divinity 2, the fights can be (while still a grind, because ALWAYS a grind) easy or cripplingly unfun. Not hard, because even unprepared fights seldom get lethal (the above fight not withstanding) its more a case of if you aren't prepared for the fight, enjoy spending 15 mins slowly chipping away at the enemies
 - Whoever programmed the web traps, seriously rethink your life. If your party member gets webbed even out of combat, I hope you're not low level and don't have plans because you will now wait 6s in real time per check to move out of the web, sounds minor right, well thing is if your really low and the check is needs a 16+ on the dice then you're looking at average of 4 checks, trust me you can get unlucky and need 10+, yes I've sat and waited for minutes at a time just sitting and watching nothing happen....it was enough time to make a sandwich, boil a kettle and make a cup of tea, return to my desk just in time to seem my dwarf with depression finally start moving. (during my replay due to a corrupted save he had to nat 20 his check....FML)

Played a bunch more (more out of the I'm not going to let this shit beat me than actual enjoyment) and I can tell you nothing sends up red flags about a game for me faster than the hints saying ""save often"" because then you know the designers are flat out saying, please save scum, because we couldn't be bothered to balance this. I thought of this after the game autosaved and soft locked my lvl 4 party into a fight with a Cr16 Elder water elemental that I couldn't avoid and with it's AOE attacks drops 1-3 part members per hit.

Thinking I should have listened to my friends who said the game is only worth playing if you mod the hell out of it, because god knows the designers weren't going to do the work.

In short the bit that was written as a pathfinder adventure (the story) isn't bad, the ""work"" done by the studio is the hottest of garbage, seriously go to any online tabletop site and join one of those games, because the worst DM's you find on there will be no worse than the mechanical ineptitude of this game, and if by all the 7 hells you end up in one that is this bad, you can call the DM on their bullshit and won't have spent money on his half formed fire breathing demonic turd of a campaign.

Kingmaker is awful. The gameplay relies so heavily on RNG and perfect min-maxing of specific strategies that unless you are familiar with the most optimal way to build most classes, you will not be able to advance beyond Chapter 1, no exaggeration. There's a reason the default game mode sets enemies to 'weaker than normal', because on normal mode, most enemies have an AC of 20 (but most often higher) and when you're rolling a D20 with, at best, +5 to hit, all of your turns are spent watching nothing happen except each member of your party dying.

But that's not why I gave up and refunded. Traps and magical effects happen in real time, abiding by Pathfinder rules, even out of combat. Hit a Web trap. Web lasts for five to ten minutes, in REAL TIME, and with a party of 3-6 characters you are absolutely not going to be able to pass your saving throws.

I cannot stress this enough, your punishment for triggering a trap (even accidentally activating it while trying to disarm) leads to a time punishment where the only answer is to get up and let the game sit open while you do something else. This is not the only spell effect like that in the game, except it conveniently leaves out the part in the actual Pen and Paper system where you can remove spell effects like that with fire.

Pros: Seamlessly switching from turn-based to real time with pause it such a blessing, characters are well written and unique, the use of the alignment system is well done, and there are tons of choices to make each character very very unique.  

Cons: There is a lot going on, and absolutely ""wrong"" ways to build your characters, which is unfortunate.  Multi-classing is a dedicated craft in Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons, but with this game, it is absolutely necessary, and because of that, creates a very very complex gameplay that some may just avoid all together as being too complicated.

The game is unusually punishing, especially in the early levels, even on normal.  Watching my panther miss 5 attacks in a row, consistently, is strange, and awkward.

Depends on how you look at it:  The game switches gears after the first chapter going from an RPG to a city-management / time management / RPG thing.  Which, don't get me wrong, is super cool and fun, but a LOT, especially when its tacked onto the already heavy character customization.  Lots of planning, lots of loading saves, lots of using grease to make all your enemies fall, constantly, and hope your allies don't fall too.

I fully support this game, and may have spent 10 hours just creating my character, because, why not, I'd do that even without the hundreds of options BUT, this game is a lot, and too much sometimes.

I like the kingdom management, I like most of the characters, I like the camping system. I like how faithfully they reproduced the rules of Pathfinder. I even like the punishing encumbrance requirements; they feel realistic, and give you a reason to not just grab everything in sight.

But it just doesn't cohere together into a good whole. It doesn't feel like an RPG, really; everything is fighting, because fights seem to be unavoidable. I specifically built my main character with high charisma and diplomacy, and I have yet to find a single fight I could talk my way out of. Avoiding fights by stealth also seems basically impossible, as they always have enormous groups of sentries patrolling tiny corridors. 

This would be okay if the fights were fun, but they aren't. Even when you win it's either a curb-stop or an annoying slog. And except on the very lowest difficulties (where you get a bunch of obvious cheats, so winning doesn't feel satisfying), the fights are just too difficult---there are always SO MANY ENEMIES. A typical fight is something like 20 of them versus 6 of you. You are always utterly outmatched in action economy. Often just as you feel like you are making progress in a fight, enemy reinforcements will arrive for no apparent reason. To make the fights fair and not a slog, they literally needed to cut the number of enemies in half for almost every encounter.

Okay so first off im not a major fan of the genre but only because I havent played games like this often 

Truly i struggled to understand the mechanics which resulted in a hard start 
my party was wiped out on more than a few occasions and interacting with the map seemed a little lackluster
I thought about refunding within my first hour but just didnt because the story was very well narrated and I actually felt a connection to my hero and his companions for dozens of hours I was stumbling around the map trying to figure out where to go and the time limit was sort of a turn off..... AT FIRST

But Holy crap if this isnt a game worth being slapped by your ignorance for.
I refused to look into guides and spoilers and made many mistakes in my development and didnt understand how to configure my Cleric.  

Until i came across a Furious elemental (the hardest enemy i faced at the time as a random encounter) This enemy had me stupified as to how to take it down and forced me to innovate my skill uses and reading every buff and debuff skill my party had, It forced me to use items (which  in games like skyrim i rarely use anything beyond a few spells and melee) I began using mage armor to make up for my lackluster armor  I then blessed and used an inspiring aura with the bard, Enlarged my barbarian and kept healing through damage, even played with the idea of turn based gameplay (which i swithced off once i became exsperinced) It was a hard fought battle and even though it was just a random encounter while traveling the map it forced me to understand the game and to read every single aspect of my skills involving how when and if buffs stack as well as stances and item uses,   and  while doing this something clicked in my brain like a little voice saying
(you are powerful but nothing with out your companions and vice versa this world will not coddle you)  

In that moment after defeating the elemental I had a mini celebration irl then rested my group listing to the banter between my companions and truly decided the direction each would take )   Me a chaotic good cleric
surrounded my self with damage dealers and buff givers and from that moment on it became clear. 

Start planing accumilate items and spells to overcome all possible enemies which have the potential to wipe entire parties and to finally properly begin my journey to find the stag lord and the little crap who we are in in contest with  at hour 39 I am now a baron and have began playing with the kingdom mangement and may turn it to auto.

Parrying in Sekiro is a walk in the park compared to this. Finishing Neverwinter Nights and the expansions is something an untrained dog can do compared to this game. If you are not a hardcore RPG player, the kind that plays in permadeath mode with only one save file, this is not the game for you. Let me try to explain:

First and foremost, the battles in the game are difficult, which would be ok if it wasn’t for the some of the other mechanics that interfere with them: the main quests are timed, ALWAYS, in every chapter of the game except for the prologue (which is basically a tutorial). So, at the start of each chapter, they tell you how many in-game days you have to finish that quest or the entire chapter. To be fair with the game, when your character is walking around in an area or city time passes on a 1 to 1 scale, so 1 minute in real life is one minute in the game. However, travelling on the world makes the time pass faster, which makes sense, your party is crossing great distances. The problem is that you cannot travel for more than a few hours without getting the fatigue debuff, which reduces every party member’s dexterity and strength by 2 points. To counter that you need to stop to rest, but to rest you need rations (one per party member) and time, which can be considered a resource in this game. So, you stop and rest for at least 9 hours (some mechanics like not having enough rations make it last longer), even if nobody in the party is wounded. If you insist on pushing forward your party will get the exhausted debuff, instead of -2 to strength and dexterity your group now has -6. God forbid you meet with the weakest possible enemy in this circumstances, because your party will likely be wiped. Essentially, you are stuck in a loop, you need time to properly be ok to battle, but that same time is a finite resource because you have to finish the main quests within a certain amount of time, and the battles are difficult, some of them are even unfair for the average player, like being ambushed by a group of slavers that are not only higher level than you, but also come in greater numbers. If you rest so that you can try to fight, you loose time and risk failing the main quest and therefore the game in the first chapter, if you don’t rest so you have enough time to finish the quest your party will be severely debuffed and will not be able to win a single fight. Now the cherry at the top is this: if your party is encumbered they cannot travel on the world map, but if they become encumbered because of the fatigue debuff (reducing the strength of the party members reduces the total weight the party can carry) this will only affect them once they have entered an area, trapping your party in that area until you either rest (which will consume time and rations) or get rid of part of the items you are carrying. You cannot push forward a bit more to get to the ONLY merchant in the first chapter. These are not inherently bad mechanics, but the way they were put together here makes the game extremely frustrating. If you suffer from anxiety like I do, please avoid this game, it will not bring you any joy.

As I write this I am absolutely stuck. Cannot go anywhere without either entering in an impossible fight or getting the exhausted (-6) debuff. I even tried to lower the difficulty of the game to the lowest possible and my party still loses to the slavers or gets very wounded from enemies such as Kobolds or Elks (I am not joking; two members of my party were knocked down by deers). I am an average player, not good, but not horrible and yet every single encounter in the game makes me reload my saves at least five times until I can win with acceptable losses of health.

For context, I bought this game after finishing (and enjoying) Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire. I started a new file in Kingmaker with default difficulty/settings, hoping to experience a somewhat similar CRPG with a unique underlying ruleset. Pathfinder rules are new to me, though they are more relatable to my tabletop D&D experience than PoE was and that seemed like a positive.

Unfortunately I had to stop playing this game relatively early on. I don't think it was respecting my time as a player. I don't mind being challenged, but I do mind tedium. This game is unfortunately slavishly devoted to the ruleset, to the detriment of modern CRPG standards and player experiences. Let's talk about some of the examples:

Post-prologue, I begin exploring in earnest, heading to a trading post to solve some immediate banditry problems, before moving on to the wider world. I stop at the nearest point-of-interest marked on the map. A manticore devours my humble party quite deftly. Neat. I guess I'm not supposed to visit here yet. Now, this isn't the first time a game has thrown a high-level enemy into a starting area. In isolation, this would be in poor taste, but forgivable. But as far as I can tell, this is simply the norm for the game. You will encounter enemies you are unable to deal with, and you will have no indication of the challenge of an area or enemy until they crush you, forcing you to reload and prepare differently or return much later at a higher level. Frankly, this isn't the experience I want in a game anymore. I don't think its unreasonable for a quest or an area or an enemy to include UI indicating a rough level of appropriateness for your current party. Did I fail to kill the manticore because I didn't buy ""manticore repellant"" at the shop? Or because it's five levels higher than my current party? Or am I just bad? I actually have no idea, because there's no feedback in any of the systems hinting that any of those possibilities are more likely than the other.

The next quest you get in the first outpost involves retrieving berries from a cave filled with spiders. This topic has been well-covered by other reviews so I will try to be brief. Some of the spiders are ""Swarms"", which cannot be harmed by traditional weapons (like swords or bows). Unfortunately I have no real agency over my party at this point. I have no access to AoE spells. The quest-giver did helpfully provide me with some flasks that can damage the spider swarms when thrown. The quest giver [i]did not[/i] mention that those throws can miss or deal minimal damage, resulting in me running out of flasks while mid-combat (which cannot be escaped). Don't worry, I have some torches in my inventory and those apparently work on swarms. I equip the torches and watch my remaining living party members swing at the swarm. Miss. Miss. Miss. 1 dmg. Miss. I did eventually defeat the spiders without wiping, but not before my largely melee party was covered in STR debuffs that now meant I was too encumbered to leave the zone and head back to the road.

Am I angry that a game asked me to plan ahead and hinted that I should do so? Am I angry that I need to change my tactics to accommdate a specific fight? No, not at all. But I am frustrated that this is the experience within the first couple of hours of the game. There's no difficulty scale-up present here. We go from a relatively mindless prologue to a series of contrived and abrupt challenges. Was this really the best place to introduce swarms to the player? I don't think so. Did I feel clever for watching my party slowly swing torches at nigh-invincible swarms of spiders, per the hint I was given? I can tell you that it was not particularly compelling gameplay.

This game accurately models weight/encumberance and its effects on fatigue and travel. I'm sure some people love this. I have to say, coming fresh off of PoE where they basically ignore encumbrance completely, I found the Kingmaker system to be a time sink. You'll spend a lot of time resting as you travel in this game. That process requires consumable camping supplies. Those supplies weigh more than anything else you own, so you can't carry too many at once. If you do, you can't really loot anything. You're not only forced into a loop of resting constantly, but also having to return to civilisation to restock on camping supplies constantly. Fundamentally, I didn't feel like these systems were additive to my experience. More often than not, it just felt like they were wasting my time. But admittedly, this is more of a subjective point.

Finally I reached my breaking point. I was continuing along the critical path, chasing our in-game rival. I made some fairly innocuous choices and followed him after an encounter. I arrived in a new location I had never visited before, and experienced a brief Kobold scene. I cleaned up some Kobolds and tried to leave the area. I could not leave. See, the world map knows I had never been here before, so no connecting roads are present. I clicked on every nearby point of interest, but no path could be found. I returned to the encounter map. There was no way to traverse back to the place I had originally come from. I reloaded. No change. Online, I found some examples of others in the same broken position. The only advice was to reload an earlier save. I sat and stared at the screen in disbelief. How have I soft-locked my progression on the critical path during the first handful of hours? How has this never been fixed? The first 20 hours of any game should be some of the most polished time you experience. I'm genuinely terrified to proceed at this point because I don't want to risk wasting more of my time on a new problem that amounts to ""just reload an earlier save"".

I think it's interesting that ~85% of players have completed the Prologue, but only ~51% are making it to the next major story beat (establishing the barony). Think about that. A huge percentage of players are bouncing off this game in the first ten hours. Is that a coincidence? I was really optimistic before I started playing. Apparently, that's not an uncommon feeling.

Now, this is absolutely a good game for some players. This is perhaps the hardcore no-hand-holding experience they've always wanted. The experience I described was very negative but there was so much here that seemed promising to me. I wanted to really get into the class and combat systems. I was engaged in the limited world-building I had seen so far.

The reason I can not recommend this game is because the game gets you addicted due to its idea and it's promises to get better (my own excuse to keep playing it), however, in reality - stepping back and looking at it; it's actually a bad game.

The game is littered with bugs, inconveniences, and very poor progression design ( mob difficulty, kingdom management, world logic, etc). This game could have been truly amazing, however, I have never played a game that made me work this hard for everythingL

Sorting inventory: Well all items collected will be randomly thrown around the inventory screen. If you want to manage it; you will need to pick up each item individually, and can't scroll up else the item will just go back to it's original slot; so now you need to move each item up the list, scroll up, and move the item further up the bag. 

Kingdom management: Fun to start with, however, you hardly ever have time to do what you want on this screen, as most quests have a time limit and force you to rush around, which is the next point.

Questing: you basically need to rush around. You have a time limit on quests, and you need to get them done straight away in some cases (else your kingdom stats will fall and you will have a hard time getting them back up, as you won't have much time to level every adviser up ect (because you yourself, for some reason, need to waste 14, later 7 in game days on a single adviser level).

I'm a fan of Divinity and Pillars. I love Path of the Damned difficulty and min-maxing - I have allot of fun. I did PoD with nothing but companions. Pathfinder has so many bugs, including ""pathfinding"" itself - the AI are retarded and nothing in this game is smooth - you will need to fight the game many times. I hope the second one is better, however, the time this game has been out; I doubt it will be any better. This companies programming team seem very weak.

-Reasonable graphics, good enough without being the center of attention. Could use some work when it comes to models.

Cons:
-Some mechanics are messed with and makes everything a bit more complicated, e.g. flanking does not work the ""standard"" way
-Critical information is hidden away, making it hard to know what certain spells do or different feats
-Metagame knowledge is almost required for building characters and for combat, as the game does a poor job explaining them
-Plot choices are unclear, leading to some frustration; will X betray me? Who gets to do what? You can lock yourself out of a lot of gameplay by making the ""wrong"" choice, online research is recommended.

There is really only one big con though, and that is that the game has totally broken pacing. Generally in an RPG, you want challenges to correspond to the character level. Without enemy scaling, it is critical to telegraph what sort of challenges to expect, so that nobody runs into overly difficult encounters without some warning.

Unfortunately, the developers are... well, I hate to be insulting, but they're completely idiotic when it comes to  organizing encounters. I have never dealt with worse encounter planning in an RPG. You can be on a quest fighting kobolds at level 3 and comes across some level 13 undead abomination with an AC of 33. You can fight your early-game rival who, at the start of combat, kills half your party with a fireball (again, you are level 3-4). You can be exploring around an area where you were fighting some wolves and hit a trap that kills more than half your party in one shot. You can go to a location noted for rats and fight level 8 stealthed rogue wererats. The difficulty jumps all over the place, with no warning or rhyme or reason.

In no other game have I had to make such use of the quicksave and quickload buttons. It's frankly absurd here, because of course I just quicksave before every encounter to judge the difficulty, so I'm never punished for this bad game design, but it's frustrating to have that player agency taken away; I want the encounters to be meaningful, and to be surprised, but not to be randomly punished for exploring.

It's no better when the encounters are completely inane timewasters. You can be traveling and have a random encounter where two low-level bandits want to pick a fight with six heroes. What is the point of this? Why would two guys take on a half-dozen fighters and wizards? It's indicative of the developer's complete lack of experience or thought. They really have no clue how to build reasonable challenges into the game.

This poor design really brings down the game. The combat and story are decent, but when it comes to the exploration part the entire game is dragged down with it. If you're willing to do research and quicksave/quickload all the time, it might be acceptable to you, but if you're looking for a real RPG experience this is not it.",1625483747,1625483747,False,3,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

Expected something like Pillars of Eternity and well the experience was surprisingly close, but much more painful. This game has made me appreciate clarity and good explanations. However with enough rpg experience you kind of can navigate descriptions well enough to make this less of an issue. 

The main problem was combat. Game has the option of real time, but imo was definitely balanced for turn based. Some CC's feel like they last for 10x longer on real time when in Turn-based they take 2 rounds max. Dice rolls can be funny and make you feel like RNGsus has it out for you. I literally got wiped out in the tutorial due to getting critically hit 5 times and my characters missing EVERYTHING. I let it slide cause I'm used to the triviality of dice rolls. Later I found myself in a fight where the only way to hit the monster was getting exactly 20 on the dice roll (d20). Only reason is because that's considered a guaranteed hit otherwise the AC of the creature was too high to hit with my level 3 characters. It's probably worth mentioning this was on normal difficulty. These type of games sort of smooth out the difficulty curve with levels, but honestly getting destroyed by lowly bandits in the first 2 rounds of combat and random encounters that feel like the DM is trying to punish you, it just feels like too much of a slog.

Lastly, a major annoyance that had minor effects on the actual gameplay is the movement. Encumbrance will make you either run around like Sonic on steroids or a boat in a sea molasses, sometimes erratically changing between the two based on terrain. Or at least i think it was because of terrain?

So much potential. Voice acting straight up impressed me. I could even see myself trying again at a later date, but I'm putting it down for now and save myself the ulcers.",1625452878,1625452878,False,4,1,0.539951622486114502,0,True,False,False

It's based on a splinter TTRPG of D&D, Pathfinder, and has similar mechanical depth. It's written by Chris Avellone, one of my favourite game developers. It's a game that has serious potential, and which is a lot of fun. 

But my frakking god, this game is badly balanced and designed. Maybe this is just my bias from playing D&D every Saturday evening IRL, but if this was an actual tabletop adventure, I'd shoot the DM. The encounters are badly balanced for low-level characters. There seems to be no scaling systems in place, as I encountered a floating skull who could repetitively cast fear on my party and disable more than half my characters every single round...at level three. Admittedly, this is apparently an optional boss fight, but it didn't exactly communicate this very well. His AC was insanely high, his attacks far too powerful, and my autosave for level entry had been overwritten by the boss fight autosave. I ended up reloading, and lost three hours of progress. 

There are consistent bugs with attacks and spellcasting in turn-based combat. Your spells will cast, but there will be absolutely no effect after the casting animation plays, and so you'll waste a entire turn. Attacks will sometimes be completely unavailable regardless of whether you have your entire action left, and I have no clue why. The real-time combat is the worse option though, since you still have to manually attack with the character you are controlling, and it is far clunkier and difficult to use. 

I will stress something though: this is not a bad game. You will probably have fun with it besides these issues. But I cannot personally recommend this game solely on the fact that scaling is nonexistent, and it follows a lot of the bad qualities of old-school TTRPGs.",1625383278,1625383278,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

FYI you didnt stop me I took him out in the wilderness and fed him to a pack or owl bears.... no res after combat on screw that little bastard.  Still not good enough you didnt let my character keep his word.  He might be evil but he isnt a liar.

2.)  Dont ever put main character in cut scenes.  IF my character is standing there ( IE when Tristian pulls his crap in the valley of the dead)  You should have let us have the option to either keep fighting ( Remain silent??!! You know that option you gave us other times?) or cut him down on the spot and deal with WHATEVER afterwards.  Stop making cut scenes in what you claim are RP games if the character is there.  Thats you RPing for us and we all hate it!  

3.)  The order of the Rack!!!  These assholes show up in my kingdom and tell me they are looking for a criminal... I tell them I dont care and get lost.... they tell me its going to happen if I like it or not and they just WALK out.... No no no.... they can tell me that sure.... and then they can swing from the end of a rope.... beg for mercy from my guards......  die screaming as I smash them with my flaming earth shaker or maybe they could even kill me for trying.... but they where NEVER just going to walk out the door.  Its like you guys have never actually played a RP game before or maybe your just trying to piss your players off.  Seriously WTF!

If you really love RP game you will enjoy this one right up until this sort of crap starts happening.  Seriously what poor design on this interactions.  Its not just sloppy its insulting to do crap like this and then call it a RP game.  If your going to let me make a threat in the game and even roll a intimidation check then you make the person to afraid to do what I threatened them not to.  If your not going to do that then you damn well better give me the option to make good on what I said I would do!  Nobody like this sort of crap!  Please someone prove me wrong comment on the post and tell me you honestly like it when developers shit on you in a RP game like this.

Are you familiar with the Pathfinder 1e ruleset? 
(Here is a test: You know what the condition Nauseated does for a character)

Do you like min/maxing characters?
(Here is a test: What gives the mathematically higher to hit bonus for two melee characters: Weapon focus feats or Outflank feats)

Is google your friend when you are stuck on where to find something that is really well hidden and your patience has run out?
(No test here: Just accept that the thingy it wants you to find in that side quest you obsessively want to solve is so well hidden you wont find it on your own.... Unless you are Sherlock Holmes or his relative... which btw is relevant, see below)

Will you grind (sometimes a lot) through passages of a game to see what is on the other side of the rainbow?
(Again no test question here, you have to grind... More if you don't min/max... potentially a lot more)

Are you the grandchild of Sherlock Holmes or perhaps just a latent researcher of knowledge not freely presented for you?
(You accept that in game statements like: Increase your kingdom stat in.... Loyalty - really means.... Find out, using the internet, that to do that, you need to spend 14 or 7 days with your main character doing a ""kingdom task"", that levels up your designated NPCs loyalty rating...provided you have the 10+ kingdom stat in loyalty in your realm... Oh, I didn't make 100% sense there, no problem, because you  - good sir or madam - will research it...

So, provided the above isn't a deterrent, go ahead, buy it on sale and enjoy they voice acting, the Pathfinder lore, the group and character options, etc. etc...

I personally feel really torn about this game.
It certainly has some annoying flaws, some things that are repetitive, grindy, unclear etc.
It feels a little like being a player at a table that really wants to have a good time, but sadly the DM isn't the greatest, the story is OK though, it is just the CR balance that is slightly off, kinda forcing you to min/max to avoid crying blood... 
A small recommendation anyway - if you really like Pathfinder :)

The rules tweaks made to make Pathfinder workable as a CRPG are glitchy + inconsistent and the enemies are wildly unbalanced (presumably to accommodate a meta of save-scumming).

Short story: It is a technically-playable game experience and I guess it's a decent purchase if money has no meaning for you. If the game were free, it'd be a little more than worth the time you spend playing it.

The goofy rules tweaks allow absurdly-high stats due to allowing many bonuses to stack that wouldn't be allowed in PNP and the classes are janky as all get-out. A couple examples: Eldritch Knight doesn't require a level in a martial class, just one feat spent on a single martial proficiency. The Infernal Sorcerer bloodline gives a +2 to Difficulty Class of Charm spells - but there are no Charm spells in the game (the DC bonus does NOT apply to compulsion spells). The Aldori Defender Fighter archetype removes 3 fighter bonus feats for no reason I can discern. The scare spell applies to all enemies in a 30ft radius rather than 1 enemy per 3 levels. These are just the annoying things I noticed in the last couple days of playing.

Companion characters are unoptimized hunks of junk - Valerie being the worst offender. The most popular builds for her online involve tons of multiclass cheese to completely ignore her starting build. Meanwhile, even the lowliest bandits and goblins will have PC class levels and optimized stats far in excess of the PNP bestiary rules for some bizarre reason. 

For those who aren't familiar: only ""heroic"" aka elite/noteworthy NPC's/monsters in Pathfinder are supposed to have levels in Fighter/Wizard etc. while mooks are supposed to have levels in classes like ""Warrior"" and ""Aristocrat"" and ""Expert"".

Case in point: in one of the starting areas where your party is assumed to be level 3, there's a will o wisp with 4 levels of sorcerer. A will o wisp alone is a Challenge Rating 6 creature, which should be a tough fight for a level 3 party. A will o wisp with 4 class levels that complement the base build is a CR10, which is considered a tough fight for a level 7 party. The SOB had an armor class of 37, which meant that the only way to beat it would be to cheese the encounter by savescumming, preparing a loadout specifically for this surprise encounter and then rely on natural 20's or invisibility-potions/glitterdust-blinding to beat down it's ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR HIT POINTS.

That's just one enemy out of very many that received arbitrary ridiculous buffs from the devs to double their challenge level or more, while leaving players with paltry XP rewards. I know that CRPG's are different than RPG's but FFS this crap is annoying.

This is the most obnoxious kind of ""challenge"" and I don't really have respect for people who act like it's fun to savescum through encounters you've played a dozen times before. Part of the fun of playing PNP Pathfinder is the fact that you can't be prepared for everything and sometimes you get caught with your pants down or get bad rolls, then you have to roll with those punches - that means being prepared with scrolls and wands for any situation, not prepared to hit the reload key.

- The bugs were horrible (I assume this has been corrected)
- Balance was horrible (might have been fixed, I sorta doubt it)
- The pathfinder rules simply don't allow any interesting builds - nothing is ""front loaded"" enough to incentivise the player to pick and match abilities from different classes.
- ""Realtime and Pause"" should have died with the 90s. (The game now has a turnbased option but I didn't try it; I have my doubts it's a smooth implementation but I couldn't rightly say)
- The main story starts off with time pressure, which is a horrible game design decision. I wanna explore this new world I am thrown into, not give chase to a fucking gnome
- The worldbuilding and plot, as far as I have seen it, is super lame.

On the plus side, the engine is pretty neat and the graphics are good (with the exception of the overland map, bloody hell what a horrid mess), and from what I understand, the Pathfinder implementation is reasonably accurate.

3/20/21: I really like this game, but its abundantly clear the devs have no intention of fixing their many many game breaking bugs. Do not buy from this developer until at least the major problems are fixed.

Update 2/6/21: I really like this game, but the lag and stuttering isn't getting fixed. 

Update: 10/3/20 I like this game. I really do. But When I save the game, the graphics stutter until I restart. Given the encounters can be extremely difficult and unpredictable, I recommend saving often, which makes the save stuttering so awful that I can no longer recommend the game. Baldurs gate 3 comes out soon, try that instead. In addition, I just expereinced another frustrating bug: mouse clicks don't register, which makes combat infuriating. These bugs have been here months.

Edit: Getting stuck on loading screens and crashing to desktop is agonizingly frustrating. It's a good game, but they need to fix this. (This has been fixed as of August-ish 2020)

Edit as of 8/20/20: Stuck of loading screens seems to have been fixed at some point, thought I still wish saving the game didn't cause a huge lag spike.

The writing is a little less nuanced than I would expect from a game of this nature, but if you can forgive that, It's a really well done game. This should tide you over until Balders Gate 3. It's currently available at a steep discount thanks to the black friday sale. I highly encourage people to pick it up.

8/20/20 Edit: The further I go into the game, the more I enjoy the characters and the lore. They feel very fleshed out and understandable... I sometimes side with evil characters - something most games can't motivate me to do.

If you're familiar with D&D 3.5 edition, this game's mechanics will be familiar, but not identical.

The game has some decent AI that I would describe as a significant addition to genre.

But this review is more base on the absolutely terrible idea to have early game Swarm enemies that are INVINCIBLE. It's dumb and I don't know how a sane person came up with it, other sane people let it happen, and no one has fixed it by now. Can't even kill them with grenades which should be instant death! FIRE + TINY SPIDERS = DEAD, but here it means you do 1-6 damage and 90% of the time it's 1 out of like 10 HP. Maybe this was designed so I couldn't return the game, or maybe some people just don't care. Maybe I'll get past this, but I am an easily frustrated man who believes people should not try to sell you something that has clearly bad ideas no matter how small. At least it was $10. 

Also it seems to me that the game hasn't been too keen on explaining game mechanics and expects you to know the basics of D&D or Pathfinder beforehand so take that as a note on what to expect.

I came back and got through that part and found the game back on track until the next side quest where you track your rival. Assume we go to the location and have a fight or small interaction then continue with the plot. No, instead he flees and you track him again only to follow him to a third location. Here he started a small war and do your best to not fight them because you'll spend hours in this dungeon. I expected to go in, fight a couple of battles, find some items to gain access to a boss room, and fight the rival. But that ain't Pathfinder: Kingmaker folks.

You have entered the Dungeon of a Comical Amount of Centipedes and Spiders and some Tough Ass Skeletons. Why are there 100 enemies in a dark tree burrow that tour're not allowed to rest in where there should be just a short side quest? Why do I have to fight  constantly just to know where I'm going? And why does a simple centipede fight trigger a boss centipede in another room that wipes the party. And why are they allowed to do semi-permanent stat damage when you'll fight wave after wave as you explore and can't rest to fix that? Who designed this and why. Its a single player video game that doesn't have to stick to the rules so much that it becomes illogical and not fun for at least me and seemingly others? Make that optional, man.

And I failed to understand the hit rolls when attacking that display X vs Y numbers each time that often didn't seem to correlate to the target's AC and my attack modifier. One time it will be 7 vs 6 and I hit but the target's AC is like 12, and another time it will be 3 vs 17 which misses and I have a +7 to attack making the minimum to hit being 8. And on top of that each party member has to have the appropriate perception to see the enemy's stats as it is not shared with the party like in Divinity 2 where you can more plan better attacks. That reminds me that the skeletons from that lv2-3 dungeon had like 20+ AC which ain't good at that level when they come in packs of 3 or more.

Like I said before, I get easily frustrated and especially when I can't see the logic in something. But I'm not an angry gamer boy who will curse the names of all who impede my ""gaming experience."" But I really don't see the reason in making the game this way or playing it especially if you're not in turn based mode and on a lower difficulty. All people are flawed creatures who make mistakes so I may cast blame, but I do so as criticism and not hate or rage. These are things that can be fixed or readdressed in the sequel so hopefully this review and others contribute to that, because I did like the core ideas and the premise.

If not the best, then certainly one of the top three. If you like the genre, you would be doing yourself a disservice by overlooking this amazing game. 

It isn't perfect of course (what game is?), and if I had to point out some of Pathfinder: Kingmaker's defects, I would say that it could have been even better if they had voice acted everything instead of only the main chars/quests, and it would have been wonderful for the kingdom-management and city-building components to fully integrate into the experience, so as to allow us to walk in the very villages and towns that we built, instead of giving us pre-made environments that do not correspond to what we built. But these minor defects, which were probably unavoidable given that Owlcat is (or at least was) a rather small indie studio based in Moscow, and not a triple-A game producing Silicon Valley behemoth like Electronic Arts, Ubisoft or Bethesda, are not that significant anyway in the big scheme of things, especially in light of all the things that Pathfinder: Kingmaker does right (which is basically everything else). 

There are so many great featuers in this game that I don't feel I could ever even begin to do it justice if I tried covering them all, so I will just point out one of them, which stood out to me as it is the first time I see this implemented in any game: Pathfinder: Kingmaker features both a Baldur's Gate like RTwP (Real TIme w/ Pause) system as well as a Turn-Based mode, but unlike other games which offer both (like Pillars of Eternity II), it allows switching back and forth seamlessly between the two at any point in the game (even in mid-battle!). Amazing stuff, which lets us to play turn-based whenever there is a challenging fight that requires our full attention, while using RTwP to clear out the easier mobs/areas without having to tediously go through every single turn manually. This is truly the best of both worlds!

In conclusion, if you like games such as the classic Baldur's Gate series or the more recent Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin incarnations of the genre, you owe it to yourself to have a serious look at Pathfinder: Kingmaker (and at the soon to be released Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, currently available as a preview/beta if you are willing to spend an extra 60 bucks or so to support its development).  

Finally, if you are on the fence about buying this game, you should know that there are numerous ""Let's Plays"" on YouTube that can help you in determining if this is the right product for you. I would suggest checking out Cohhcarnage's channel, which features two different playthroughs of Pathfinder: Kingmaker, along with two different playthroughs of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and two different playthorughs of Pillars of Eterninity II, plus playthorughs of the older Divnity and Pillars entries, of a recent Pathfinder: WOTR preview build and of the classic Baldur's Gate games.",1624994566,1624996813,True,8,1,0.520896792411804199,0,True,False,False

I have not run the Kingmaker Adventure Path but I have ran Rise of The Rune Lords and I feel like this game really dose capture Paizos storytelling. Though this game dose combine many of the skills, which I do not think takes away from the game, the feats and spells are right out of the Pathfinder Core rule book.

I first played this game on PS4, I really enjoyed it but it was pretty buggy. I have gotten this game on the PC and I find it running a lot smother. Though if there is one complaint I have it is that there are a number of bugs in this game. I do know that the developers have done a lot to fix many of these. During this play through I have only run into one stop that was giving me trouble. I had to save the game and restart my computer and then it ran through the spot fine.

If you're in the same position as me on this one, let me tell you that those reviews apparently came from a very buggy launch, and that that vast majority of these bugs have been fixed by now! 

As for the actual Game: 
Pathfinder: Kingmaker is now my favorite CRPG since Baldur's Gate 2, even overtaking the genre re-defining Divinity Original Sin 2 . Apart from a couple small Issues, it is incredibly well fleshed out, balanced, and fun to play. The story is engaging and feels rewarding to play through, and the mechanics of the Pathfinder system click neatly with CRPG gameplay.

I want to highlight a number of small things that really raise this game above the average CRPG for me:

+ Switching between real-time and turn-based combat
I don't understand why no other CRPG has done this yet. Being able to switch ON THE FLY between real-time and turn-based makes the experience SO much more rewarding, because you literally get the best of both worlds. Difficult Fight? Go into turn-based. Tedious random encounter? Just go into real-time and watch it play out over a matter of seconds.

+ A ton of options to customize your experience.
The game goes WAY beyond just setting your difficulty to ""easy,medium,hard"". You can customize every little bit of your experience, be that the difficulty of enemies, the damage taken by your party, or the difficulty of the ""Kingdom Management"" mini-game that takes up a good amount of time in your playthrough. (You can even just turn it off, if you don't want to bother with it!)

+ Great character writing.
In line with most of the more modern CRPGs, this game doesn't feature a HUGE line-up of potential party members. But the handful of party members that you DO pick up, are written in a fantastic way. They feel like real people, and when doing their long line of companion quests (most of them have 3-5 different quests!) you get to see them develop as a person, and grow ever closer to them. When I saw the ending-cards, I found myself coming to tears when I learned about the final fate of the characters whom I've grown to love a lot over the course of the game.

+ Epic length.
My playthrough took me 113 hours, and I was NOT completionist about the game. I think it's fair to assume that you won't go under 100 hours, even if you ignore most of the side-quests. Maybe 80-90 hours if you prefer real-time combat over turn-based. The great thing is: this isn't just ""padding"" the game out, but all of that is actual content that is fun to experience. In all of my time with the game, if only found myself annoyed or bored with it's story about once or twice. 

So, if you're looking for ""the"" CRPG to play right now; buy this! It's really, really, really good!",1624956526,1624956526,True,9,1,0.580349385738372803,1,True,False,False

I was a little hesitant at first to get this game since I was worried it would just be another one of those failed attempts at capturing the magic of the pathfinder tabletop roleplaying game in a video game but upon playing I had a blast! There are basically two things I think they could improve on.

1. More visual customization! The character you create stays with you the entire time so you should be able to really turn that person into the beloved player character you want. The models could do with more detail and, while there are some limited options, I feel there should be some more hair, face, body type, etc. options

2. Implementation from the tabletop game is still a little too limited. You've basically just got the core races and core classes. Many of the feats are limited usually ending with me having extremely similar builds for the entire party. 

However, with the use of mods, you can make some minor improvements on these issues. So all in all the game is fun and exhilarating! The world is extremely detailed and the quests actually feel  like they are a part of the world rather than some random thing meant for the main character alone. Well more then normal I guess.",1624951720,1624951720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
