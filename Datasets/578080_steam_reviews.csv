Edited: 10/03/2020 - The game have been improved alot since 2018. The frames are way smoother, no more random crushes, the guns are way more balanced then before, it feels way better, there are still bugs and issues but it's litterely playable and fun.
What I personaly dont like is the slow paced game, slow movement, slow peek, everything is just too slow.

Edit 25.2.2024.
Game is still slower than the others but feels way smoother and the gameplay is pretty fun.
I wish it was a little bit faster in every aspect, but for some reason I find the game very fun at its state.",1545265145,1708859358,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Apparently, you need to go to the settings. It's set by default on ""Borderless"" which ruins the gameplay. Setting it on Fullscreen, no more keyboard input lag. Crazy stupid how this is a general problem yet it's a default setting.

For me, game is fun cause it feels realistic. Achievements are really time consuming but I wanna do them. Game is still alive, though there are many bots (at least in casual). Not an issue for me, since I'm not good & they make it easier.

I've only played classic and random so far. I more often see level 300+ players than around mine (60).

I have never had so mixed feeling about any game. This game is different. I have never played so much addicting game but at the same time so ruined by devs decision.

PROS:
- gunplay - honestly the best gunplay ever made
- drive bys - probably the funniest element ever created in games (requires a lot of practice)
- adrenaline - never ending top 10 adrenaline
- every game is unique
- that headshot feeling (Imagine ""feels good meme"" here)
- guns balance

CONS:
- somebody delusional from company management gives makes decisions
- I am really disappointed about that this game does not appreciate active plays. I consider myself as aggressive player and this really frustrates me, because no matter if you play public or ranked you are always rewarded better for playing passive than active. That means if you finish in top 10 with 1 kill you get rewarded better than ending 25th with 10kills.
- devs really don´t listen to feedback. Even if they say they do, they really don´t. No debate.
- devs prioritizion money over quality. If they produce bug fixing and quality improvements with same speed as they produce skins we would be playing elsewhere today (not losing players linearly).
- addition of bots - I believe this step killed the game for A LOT of players - worst step ever made.
- devs do not play the game. This is really interesting point because when you look at some changes they really makes no sense



- lot of people complain about cheaters but I can´t say I meet them a lot lately.

People say this game is dead but I do not agree. Daily peak is less than 500k players per day. So it´s still good.",1591741405,1708699112,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now after 8 years, after having played 1400 hours of PUBG since it's early release I decided to do a review about it, and probably that will be my last review, at least for years... The game is unplayable right now due to cheaters. After 1400 hours, I can distinguish who is a cheater and who is a good player. Game devs absolutely do not care about that, they are in fact happy. After the game became free, they only care about their sh*tty skin sales and other monetizing stuff. Any player who thinks coming across cheaters frequently is utterly infuriating should not play this game, the game is literally dead due to unhampered cheaters.

The game’s realistic simulation and massive zones make it stand out among other battle royales. The thrill of survival after parachuting into the open world is unmatched. The need to be stealthy and tactical adds a layer of complexity that I appreciate. Waiting for a passing aircraft to drown out my footsteps or using a smokescreen to distract enemies are just some of the strategies I’ve used.

However, the game isn’t without its flaws. The wide selection of guns can be clunky to fire, especially compared to other modern shooters. The weapons are more tolerable in third-person mode, but they’re frustratingly inaccurate unless you switch to first-person or aim down sights. This can be a bit of a letdown, especially when you’re in the heat of a firefight.

Despite these issues, I still find myself coming back to PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game’s emphasis on realistic bullet physics sets it apart in an interesting way. It’s not as slick as some other games, but the intensity of the fights keeps me engaged. The game has managed to stay relevant and enjoyable with continuous updates and a player-focused approach. It’s a compelling choice for anyone seeking a challenging and realistic battle royale experience.

Not sure why most of the reviews on this is negative. I'm having a good time.

(Note: Lag is easily what causes 99% of every death I've had thus far.)

[2021 Review]
Lag and packet loss is terrible and you can't pick a better server since the game automatically decides 'best' server. Connection issues frequently plague the game worse than in its hey day.

Duo FPP servers are mostly bots, very low player counts in this mode.

Game crashes every other launch, devs and company don't seem to care to resolve the issue.

$10+ outfits proudly for sale. Way too expensive for an in-game cosmetic item.

'Loot boxes' (or what I consider to be basically loot boxes) only contain randomized items that can be bought for real money. BP seems to have no reason for existing. Contraband tokens seem to have no use either. (Okay well, I finally managed to find a way to use BP so... I can correct this point)

The gameplay is still as fun as I remember it, but there's more negatives now than before. I love how things sound and how the guns feel... 

It's a sad state of affairs, but I can see why many people moved on to other games...

[2024 Review]

I keep coming back to this game because the guns feel so good. Though many of the issues mentioned above are still a concern, I think the game is pretty good right now. I haven't seen many cheaters in recent matches and the matches feel relatively evenly matched for me (aka not many players who are just way better than me in the average match).

I found this game extremely boring, but with 7 hours of gameplay to my name, there was no hope steam would refund me. Needless to say this has sat in my library since then. In between now and the time I originally bought this game, it has gone from just a simply sweaty and toxic community, to an all out hacker battlefield. Where you don't face players with 20,000 hours, you are facing waves of hackers. It's amazing that people still play this god-awful game. I think the most this game ever was, was an alternative to fortnite for the sake of internet argument. Battle royales have never been good, and will likely never become good- especially if they continue to look like this pile of trash. PubG is one of the stupidest games ever made, I really hate it a lot, and now, I come to find that it is completely free. Of course these developers, and steam, being the slimy dirtbags they are, refuse to give me my $30 back despite the fact that they could have just taken my money and set it on fire and flushed it down the toilet and it would have achieved the same thing. My entire experience with this game is completely tarnished and awful. Anyone who still plays this game should be ashamed of themselves, and the developers of this game should be more than ashamed. This game is terrible, and so is everything it stands for. Fuck. This. Game. Fuck everything about it. Fuck the developers, and fuck steam for allowing this kind of shit on their store. I can't even say I hate the people who play this game really, because I mostly just feel bad for them. I don't know what kind of psychological trauma it takes to be able to endure more than 5 fucking minutes of this game, but I know it must be worse than the worst kind of physical abuse imaginable next to a stabbing, because in order to play this game you must literally have less brain-cells floating around in your head than a rotting turd. I think that jokes aside though, even besides the fact that the devs robbed me blindly, and let their game fall completely to pieces, this game is still really fucking boring. I just think battle royales are the stupidest thing ever. It's probably just me though. I think this game should have always been free. It's never been in a state where it feels like it should cost me more than just the few games I subjected myself to. I don't know how it became popular, but I am glad people aren't being robbed for it anymore at the very least.",1704230223,1708483169,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

SOOO, i have played this game a lot.
i have found in the beginning it was a pretty good battle royale game with standard features
start in lobby 
drop from plane
go into building under fire find any weapon.....(or not)
get killed or kill 
run around find better loot
get killed by no recoil cheat or chinese type hacker 
rinse repeat.

that about sums it up 
but it is a good thrilling game (also motorcycles there is some real laughs there)
the BIG downside and i mean BIg is the cheats they are actually destroying this game

Graphics:
Let's start with the graphics, or should I say, the abomination that passes for graphics in this game. It's as if the developers hired a blindfolded toddler to smear finger paint across a canvas and called it a day. Characters are rendered with all the detail of a potato, and the environments look like they were ripped straight from a 1990s screensaver.

Gameplay:
If you enjoy frustration and disappointment, then congratulations, you've found your holy grail. The controls are about as responsive as a sloth on sedatives, making even the simplest tasks feel like an exercise in futility. And don't get me started on the camera angles; it's like the game wants you to suffer.

If you enjoy the sweet serenade of nails on a chalkboard, then you might find something to like about the sound design in [Game Title]. From ear-piercing voice acting to repetitive background music that will haunt your dreams, every auditory aspect of this game is a symphony of agony.

1 out of 10 - And that's being generous.

1) There is a certain pay-to-play hidden cost in the game, namely your gaming rig. Without a decent card and setup, you're going to be at a disadvantage versus some 240hz 4090ABCXXXti dude/chick/He/She/Me/Them/Thou in his mom's basement. Its just how shit rolls. If youre offended because I hit one of your 3rd genders, well, fuck you. Sorry, not sorry 

2) The implementation of a deathcam is probably one of the best things (and only things) the game does right, where it lets you see from your killer's POV, and you can then see like ""Wow holy fuck that was stupid, why did i run like some braindead zombie out in the field and get hard railed by some sniper"". It pretty much allows you to improve and NOT falsely report people for aimbotting etc., that said though, there is a sizable amount of toxic players / cheaters in-game 

3) The game is pretty large, maintaining servers are expensive, i can get behind that. The recent shift in making the typical ""battlepass"" locked behind actual currency is going to be meh though. 5 bucks for a pretty sizable amount of content is kinda worth, but it's going to require some time investment as well. As crouching tiger fortune cookie states ""U No Likey, U No Buy"" 

TLDR: Game is trash and the ""dead game"" comments are justified. Ranked is MINIMUM 15 mins* so PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE TIME TO WASTE. Hackers AT MOST get a temp ban, then they're right back at it again in about a week or so. Doesnt matter when hackers usually have a alts to quickly hop on to. Shits legit demoralizing and i honestly feel bad for the ones who actually spent a chunk of money for skins ingame lol. So glad i didnt buy anything beyond the starter kit and pass. 

 its ""Free""tm, but if you decide to actually ""GiT GuuD"" you're gonna have to invest the time / money/ prayers

Edit: Seems the deathcam is only applicable in casual games , not even normies. Thats defeating the purpose of your own game's features wtf? Really wish there was a ""meh"" button for games",1701916320,1708258336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(if we want to play with paid lobbies only or both)
That's it...Easy

2nd: If you really care for protecting your players against cheating,
the simple and easy way you can do is, Don't allow users below level 100 to play
with higher levels (And that's the gold point and cheating problem with any battle
royal games),So new accounts they need to hit or reach level 100 to be able to play
with higher levels.So this definitely will make the game boring to those losers and
slowing them down when they decide to cheat again...

So again the gold question what's the point of banning 60k-100k cheaters every week?
And they are able to comeback and cheat again and with a different hardware...
And the game is free to play and you put those low levels accounts with us!?
That is super fishy or stupidness.

Released in 2017, PUBG pioneered the battle royale genre, and its impact on the gaming landscape remains undeniable.

One of PUBG's greatest strengths lies in its dynamic and unpredictable gameplay. Each match presents a unique challenge as 100 players are dropped onto a massive map, scavenging for weapons, armor, and supplies while constantly being forced to move closer together by an encroaching circle of death. This ever-shrinking safe zone forces players into intense encounters, fostering a mix of strategic planning and split-second decision-making.

The game's realistic graphics and immersive sound design further heighten the tension, drawing players into the gritty, war-torn landscapes where every rustle of grass or distant gunshot could spell danger. From the sprawling hills of Erangel to the dense jungles of Sanhok, each map offers its own distinct atmosphere and strategic opportunities, ensuring that no two matches feel quite the same.

PUBG's gunplay is challenging and rewarding, requiring players to master recoil control and bullet physics to secure kills. Whether engaging in long-range sniper duels or frantic close-quarters firefights, the game offers a diverse arsenal of weapons and attachments to suit various playstyles.

While PUBG's gameplay is undeniably addictive, it is not without its flaws. The game's performance can be inconsistent, especially on lower-end hardware, leading to occasional lag spikes and optimization issues. Additionally, the learning curve can be steep for newcomers, as mastering the mechanics and strategies requires time and patience.

Despite these drawbacks, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds remains a seminal title in the battle royale genre, offering a visceral and immersive experience that continues to captivate players around the world. Whether playing solo, with a squad of friends, or competing in esports tournaments, PUBG delivers heart-pounding action and unforgettable moments that keep players coming back for more.

Still playble, better playing party with friends good luck and have fun

As a player who eagerly jumped into PUBG from the very beginning (2017), I was captivated by its promise of intense battles and exhilarating moments. The thrill of being dropped onto an island, scrounging for weapons, and battling it out against dozens of other players had me hooked from the start.

However, my initial excitement has since turned into disappointment as PUBG has failed to live up to its potential. What was once a promising game filled with endless possibilities has become a shadow of its former self, plagued by a multitude of issues and missed opportunities.

One of the most frustrating aspects of PUBG is its lack of meaningful updates and improvements. Despite numerous promises from the developers, the game has remained stagnant, with fundamental issues such as optimization problems and server issues persisting for years.

Furthermore, the introduction of paid loot boxes and microtransactions has soured the experience, turning what was once a fair and balanced playing field into a pay-to-win nightmare. It's disheartening to see a game that once prided itself on skill and strategy devolve into a cash grab fueled by greed.

To add insult to injury, the constant influx of cosmetic items, particularly those catering to the Asian market, has only served to clutter the game and detract from its immersive atmosphere. Instead of focusing on meaningful gameplay improvements, the developers seem more interested in churning out superficial additions to milk players for more money.

As a longtime fan of PUBG, it pains me to see how far the game has fallen. What started as a promising concept has been squandered by poor management decisions and a lack of commitment to delivering a quality experience. Unless significant changes are made, I can no longer in good conscience recommend PUBG to anyone looking for a satisfying gaming experience.

The ""Charm"" of PUBG:
Ever dreamt of spending half your game hunting for a weapon, only to be taken out by someone named ""xXxSn1perXxX""? Welcome to PUBG, where the odds are never in your favor and every bush is a potential death trap.

Glitches: The Feature You Didn't Ask For:
Who needs polished gameplay when you can have a glitchy adventure through walls and floors? PUBG offers a crash course in levitating cars and teleporting players, turning every match into a comedy of errors.

Lost in Translation:
Teamwork makes the dream work, unless your teammate's microphone sounds like a potato in a blender. Cue the incomprehensible shouting as you try to coordinate an attack. Who knew ""let's go to the drop zone"" could sound so much like ""let's go eat a donut""?

Conclusion:
In short, PUBG is the game where chaos reigns and sanity goes to die. But if you're up for a wild ride and don't mind sacrificing your dignity for a few laughs, PUBG might just be your cup of glitchy tea. Just remember to pack your sense of humor—and maybe a stress ball or two. Cheers to the madness, and may your chicken dinners be as elusive as a leprechaun's pot of gold.

High ping players have ridiculous advantage as game relies on client side information. It also makes game very vulnurable to cheating.

Devs mostly spend their time making new useless micro transaction items, like clothes and skins for weapons.
They had  a campaign ""fix the game"", but it really doesn't seem to be high priority as they make new content and useless dlc.

So my advice for you, if  you don't have the game, don't buy it. Even your friends are playing it, just skip it.

Update: 11/2019
As I've still played casually now and then we they updat the game and  I got suggestion to edit  the review.
It's still bad  - as it was before.
- Internet game is mostly out of sync, you die around the corners etc.
- You hear sound of a gun but see character model when it's too late.
- A lots of cheating. (aimbot, ESP, recoil hacks are still very common)
- Sounds are just so bad compared to other games.

Update: 05/2020
Still bad.
The sounds are so bad compared to other games.
The control feeling is very bad.
Item management is so bad compared to the other games.
The online experience is still so bad, so the only way to play would be LAN.
The new small maps are terrible.

Update 01/2024
Generally the UX compared to ""almost every other FPS game"" is still so bad.
They also spoiled the game permanently as you cannot choose what map you want to play. 
I don't wanna play the new maps. I only want to play Erangel and Miramar.

this game screams mid. I've played it since release and coming back to it is a semi-yearly ritual. The guns feel good, the recoil is silly but fine, the cheaters are mostly banned. I miss when this game was more survival oriented and less trying to be a fast-paced shooter. The long range fights, the slow game, that was fun. This isn't CoD and nearly every additional map just sucks. Of course, there's no way to pick the maps you want to play, so you're forced into that shitshow that is Sanhok. The monetization is even worse than PUBG Mobile (which is somehow still a more enjoyable experience, still allowing you to choose maps). You win nothing tokens and can collect thousands of them for a chance at a nothing spray or some bullshit like that. It's trying so hard to be an outdated MMOJRPG with the collection of tokens and crafting items and- seriously, what the fuck is this? The game is fine (besides the maps) but feels a little dated; it can be fun but your time is probably better spent elsewhere. I miss the age of good battle royales like Ring of Elysium (in its prime), Fortnite is really the only competent Battle Royale even worth playing at this point. It's such a shame the genre died so painfully. 

I might still play it from time to time, but calling it a guilty pleasure feels like an exaggeration. Go play mobile if you wanna see PUBG Altyn guy fly around with a grappling hook and magical samurai sword.",1707609067,1707609162,False,1,0,0.497312664985656738,1,True,False,False

Hacking appears to be less of an issue now.  I've managed to play 8 consecutive games without a blatant hacker.  

That said, I still can't recommend this game. 

1)  Ranked does not appear to work.  I've literally never been matched after having sat in queues for 20+ minutes.  
2)  ""Random Map"" is very streaky.  8 games played and 8 matches played on the crappy volcano map.  Still looking for an Erangel map selection feature...
3)  still no TPP Duos in NA queue.

The game has seen constant updates which is always necessary for games like this and I think why it retains the player base that it currently has. 
Combat can be fun but frustrating sometimes when in the heat of the moment you suffer damage that may have been different than what you were expecting. There is a variety of maps that I wish were in constant rotation because I feel that a given rotation has a map removed for an entire month and I like to experience all the different places to play at. 
There is a huge amount of different currencies and tokens that can be frustrating to navigate and add complexity to cosmetic crafting that is unnecessary. It can be disheartening to find out you need several hundred dollars worth of currency to upgrade a progressive weapon or have to stick to playing the game for dozens if not hundreds of hours to complete it otherwise. I've never approved systems like this but to each their own.
Overall, I think it's a fun experience, enhanced when you play with people you like instead of random strangers but even that can bring benefits. Partying up is easy enough and lobbies usually never have issues in staying intact. Drop in and get kitted because PUBG is ready for you.",1707576242,1707576242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every new monthly batch only lasted 1-2 days without hackers. After that, infested with hackers again. Useless game developers ever. Not worth your time at all. All their said effort of banning hackers are fake and just for show. Nothing is been done actually. Plus, I'm pretty suspect that the top management of PUBG themselves are selling the source code to hacker companies to make money. Otherwise, how is that even possible that until now, they can't solve this issue. Why other game companies got no such issue? Very logic and common sense, is that they are the one who sold their source code out, and hacker companies paid them with profit sharing.

Old Reviews:
Too many hacks. 90% players are using hacks, and PUBG is not doing enough to stop hackers. They should ban players' ID instead of character, because characters can always create anew. Hackers can always create a new character to hack. If PUBG ban player steam ID, then hackers will find it useless to hack, because they need to repurchase the game to hack every time got banned.",1572501413,1707532698,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game sucks ass and has obviously shifted to cater to mobile markets, casual gameplay, and foreign userbases. While these things individually are fine in their own rights, this has resulted in a game that constantly wants you to buy stuff either directly or open a bunch of CSGO-style crates with most rewards having no real value on the Steam market. The maps are too big, encountering another player takes too long, character models can be hard to see especially the farther away they are, the cosmetics are very uninteresting, and the queue time for FPP solos is about 2 minutes. Oh and the TTK is still unbearably small. Getting 2 tapped by an SKS from a guy 300 feet away is ridiculous.

This game was kind of fun when it came out but really only had the advantage of being the only BR out that wasn't fortnite and had a decently sized playerbase.

The first problem that my friends and I have are always new and new irrelevant map updates or even more uninteresting new maps made according to the same principle. The only good map in the last 2 years is Deston both in terms of looks and the secret rooms (better weapons and equipment) in it and the use of the drone (but guess what? there were new updates and the drones disappeared and thus made the rooms useless, and on top of that there is still a chance to get deston in a random map for a real 5%, especially with the arrival of Taego 2 (Rondo). All maps are made according to the principles of Korea, China and completely uninteresting (sorry, not all of them, but the ones we have to play, because you get Erangel or Miramar or Deston as rarely as you'll find a flare gun in the game). Not to mention that the maps are unblockable and you have to go out and in and out and in eight times... just to play one normal map that was in this game from beginning. There were also some minimaps, but luckily someone had the sense to remove it and put it to a minimum (they appear every 4-8 months, like some kind of hemorrhoid)

The second problem the most shittiest anticheat there is in 2024 the price would go to PUBG !!! Swarm of cheaters in every game (they get banned but they can make an account in 1 minute and continue to play - it should be that they can only play the game via digital platforms like steam, because here I doubt that anyone will buy a new phone, make new mail and buy new games when they are banned, the fact is that there would be a lot less of them than there are now), if you are unable to make a prober anticheat that is.

Third problem is the ugly cosmetics for the players' weapons and clothes (80% for garbage), considering that it takes you 10 minutes (if you look at some i would say you are competing who can make it faster and uglier) to make some skin for weapons or clothing, you could at least make one that coincides with some other culture than Asian (dragon on dragon on dragon with some ugly bunnies and 10000 diffrent colors...its getting really annoying oooo dont forget asian-fusion (make viking horns put something asian on it - this will sell for sure)


I have nothing against any culture and respect everything, but if you sell something as a global game (try to include something global as well). Or the game will decline, as it has in the last few years.

The only good things in recent years was the collaboration with McLaren and Aston Martin and the new map Deston (without later updates).",1707346491,1707346766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Meanwhile Apex, and other BRs are not afraid to take risks adding, removing, and even reworking their core systems. The current devs of this game cannot even fix old bugs. Always verifying the game after every patch which I find to be odd since this is the only game in my library CONSTANTLY asking me to do so. They also have the gall to heavily monitize this game, adding layers upon layers of currency and RNG making these processes convoluted, meanwhile removing FREE and GOOD rewards a player can work on. I get that APEX has heavily monetized their game with their skins and heirlooms BUT at the very least, a player can work on getting those skins with minimal or even without using money AND they look good.

I am not saying that they have zero good thing added to the game. The sandstorm on miramar or the snowstorm in vikendi, those legacy map reworks, the addition of mortar and redeploy, improved ping system, those are all good additions and enhancement to the game but i feel like they're throwing everything in a wall and seeing what sticks with these patches. New maps aren't even good, the old smaller version maps, I feel, have been forgotten.

From time to time you may be in a lobby that is really only 3 teams and everyone else is bots, you will get the occasional cheater and compared to other BR games out there the pace of a PUBG match is quite a bit slower. Additionally the removal of Solo FPP is extremely frustrating, especially when they still keep the Team Deathmatch servers up that can never be filled as not enough players play it. 

In saying all of this, I came back to this game after 3 years playing other games and the changes they have made to balancing, Quality of life improvements, new features and even the silly missions has made me genuinely enjoy this game as they seem to really be taking feedback from a larger stand point and look to improve the game with each update. 

When looking at other notable titles such as Fortnite, APEX Legends or the kiddy friendly Farlight, the play-style of PUBG still stands tall. Unlike these other titles, this game has a deeper tactical feel more akin to CS or Siege and if you can get 2 or 3 of your mates to all come together, hours of fun ensues. If you are a 100% solo player, may have more fun on the aforementioned titles above, however if you are looking to play with others, have genuine fun and have a more tactical shooter experience while still knowing this is just casual fun - I would recommend this game over CS2 in a heartbeat.",1707269420,1707269420,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I can't recommend it because, particularly in the Australian region, the player base is small enough that getting games can take a serious amount of time, if you are anything less than good it means a large time investment for minimal fun return.

Amending some time later: still wouldn't recommend it - though casual matches are okay and bots help fill up matches so you don't want a million years in all matches.

Sadly the graphics and gameplay feel dated at this point so hopefully PUBG2 comes someday. I really enjoy the variety of maps and weapons compared to most other BR's. 


Update: Recent updates are moving this game further away from its core and further towards being a warzone clone, such as the ability to re-spawn teammates. Also, the addition of so much bloat has completely destabilized this game. I used to run on max settings and it looked and ran like a dream on my pc years ago. Now I get lots of lag and de-sync issues making the game literally unplayable at times. Overall I no longer recommend this game and hope someday we either get an optimized pubg2 in unreal5 or a pubg classic that reverts all the bloat to the og game. 
Also beware that cheaters are RAMPANT in this game. I can't tell you how many wall hacks and aim hacks I go up against but it's almost at least 1 player each game, even in casual mode. Their anti-cheat system is very bad despite how much cpu it eats up with its spyware. 

Update 2: To make matters worse the battlepass system was just updated with Rondo to require real money to purchase instead of in-game premium currency that's been used for years (G-coin). This screwed over players who purchased in-game premium currency and saved it for future battlepasses. Very scummy as there's no way to get your money back from previously purchased G-coin. 

Update 3: Add on to update 1 after custom building a new PC (my last one was 8 years old) my performance issues are largely gone.

1.
Implementing immersion breaking, cringe as fuck shitty skins and start to monetize the game with battlepasses and other nonsense.

2.
After many players left the game because of these changes they implemented bots into the game. this completely destroyed the thrill and feeling of the game where you are constantly are on your toes, listening, carefully watching the area and trying to survive. 
everyone started playing this game with the same mindset. ""it's probably a bot"" just run and gun like it's warzone.

3.
the final exodus. free to play...
to visualize the absolute madness of cheating in this game. take a look at their weekly banned accounts report. there is a link with a spreadsheet of every banned player.
it's absolutely insane to see a list of 129 players banned. until you realize that THIS WEEKLY!!! SPREADSHEET HAS OVER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PAGES!

the few idiots that are left are constantly gaslighting everyone into ""you seem to be new here. you should read these basic tips in how to play PUBG. it's very helpful to learn how this game functions""

shut the fuck up... if you don't die before you will be killed by a cheater in over 80% of all games you play. because over 75% of ALL PLAYERS are actively cheating. in 2023 they banned almost 5 MILLION Cheaters in PUBG. 

i have bought this game in week three of the early access launch over 6 and a half years ago. it was my favourite game of all time and now it's finally over.
you will not be enjoying this game, you will never see what it was before it all went to shit.

since zoomers are old enough to play these games all of them are completely unplayable.

Second Update:
after almost 1000 hours and playing since the first early access week 6 or 7 years ago... me and everyone else on the whole server got banned almost at the same time.
the whole lobby was reduced from 80 players to just 20 (one kick every second) until i was kicked too and now have a temporary game ban in my account for 24 Hours and nobody knows why.
and since the ban the chinese rootkit ""anticheat"" wellbia and another kernel driver gets regularily listed as dangerous and incompatible with VBS.

It is sad there’s not any better alternative if you’ve played this. Please never buy this game if you don’t have anything better to do, it is a waste of money and will make you rage.
I think the game is at its all time low - January 2024.

Positive:
- Making kills actually gives an adrenaline rush.
- Winning a game actually feels meaningful.
- Weapon handling is nicely balanced and you can actually get your own style, you’re not forced to play with a certain gun or loadout.

Negative:
- Hard to learn, you’re against people with 1000+ hours that will kill you before you see them.
- Takes a ton of time to learn the maps.
- Maps are rotating and can’t be chosen.
- Be prepared to be killed by sweatlords.
- Be prepared to kill some dumb AI when you expect players.
- Be prepared to get destroyed by cheaters, which you report and get banned for 1 day. and yes they are mostly Chinese and Russian.
- They want you to spend $$ on skins and seasonpasses. Please don’t buy crates to get weapon skins, it is a scam.
- The Eula Roofing is next level, they own all your private information if you accept. its just chinese spyware
- The game is actually unstable with certain hardware, you have to be lucky.
- Added AI to normal games, so you can loot money to buy a better loadout, completely ruining the game - Killing other players.
- Bugs never really get fixed, just one of the many examples: try scoping while leaning close to a wall and you will scope into the sky.
- Figuring out the recoil of a weapon and getting the muscle memory is hard when everyone is better than you.
- Takes an eternity to load the lobby after every single match. Matchmaking takes ages and can be bugged so you have to leave after a few minutes to try it again.",1706265301,1706536447,False,1,0,0.488372087478637695,0,True,False,False

UPDATE MAY 2018

No improvements in performance, hacking is still rife and ScumHole are still going down the ""rip everyone off with scam crates and paid for keys"" route. NOT RECOMMENDED!

It also turns out the developers aren't quite developers much of the games content is made 3rd party and bought in as assets so that is why we are seeing PPP!

Update Aug 2019, performance issues have gone away with a hardware upgrade 8c 16t Ryzen paired with a 6gb GTX 1060. Still a piece of crap full of cheaters, the game passes aren't worth the money. Really has gone bottom of the barrel!

[list]
[*]PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, the groundbreaking battle royale sensation developed by PUBG Corporation, stands as a landmark in the realm of multiplayer gaming, redefining the genre with its heart-pounding gameplay and relentless action. Set against the backdrop of a sprawling island landscape, players are thrust into a high-stakes battle for survival, where only the strongest, smartest, and most skilled will emerge victorious.

[*]At its core, PUBG excels in its ability to deliver an adrenaline-fueled experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The game's signature blend of intense gunplay, strategic decision-making, and heart-pounding tension creates a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience that is unmatched in its intensity. From the rush of adrenaline as the final circle closes in to the euphoria of securing a hard-fought victory, every match is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and excitement.

[*]Central to the PUBG experience is its emphasis on player choice and emergent gameplay. With a vast array of weapons, vehicles, and equipment at their disposal, players are given the freedom to approach each match in their own unique way, whether it be through stealthy infiltration, aggressive combat, or tactical teamwork. The open-ended nature of the game's sandbox environment encourages creativity and experimentation, inviting players to adapt and innovate in the face of ever-changing challenges.

[*]Moreover, PUBG boasts stunning visuals and immersive sound design that further enhances the player's experience. From the lush landscapes of Erangel to the rugged terrain of Miramar, every aspect of the game's audiovisual presentation is meticulously crafted to draw players deeper into the world of battle royale. The attention to detail is palpable, with the crackle of gunfire and the roar of engines serving to heighten the sense of immersion and intensity.

[*]However, PUBG is not without its flaws and frustrations. The game's steep learning curve and punishing difficulty may prove daunting for newcomers, requiring patience and perseverance to master its mechanics and tactics. The unforgiving nature of its gameplay can lead to moments of frustration and disappointment, as players are often left at the mercy of luck and circumstance in the heat of battle.

[*]Furthermore, PUBG performance and optimization issues may detract from the overall experience, with frequent frame rate drops, server lag, and connection issues disrupting the flow of gameplay. While efforts have been made to address these concerns through updates and patches, they remain persistent challenges that can impact the enjoyment of the game for some players.

[*]In conclusion, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS stands as a testament to the power of the battle royale genre, offering players a thrilling and immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of multiplayer gaming. With its intense action, strategic depth, and emergent gameplay, PUBG invites players to test their mettle in the ultimate test of skill and survival. While its flaws and frustrations may test the resolve of some players, its adrenaline-fueled excitement and heart-pounding intensity make it a journey well worth undertaking. As players parachute into the battlegrounds, they are reminded that in the chaos of battle, victory belongs to those bold enough to seize it.

Lots of laughs with the bots. 
Once done, close it out.  Still feels like normal mode had lots of BS.

-----------------------------------------------------

Favorite BR game but I give up.
Desync, sound changes suck, gunplay still questionable.

Good-bye PUBG.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back to recommend.
Fun with friends... without no thanks.

Desync still plauges and Bluehole/PUBG seems to pat themselves on the back every Dev letter.

But, when I win and beat the in-game BS, the accomplishment feels good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 580 hours (1.0 Patch 21)

- Every update spawns more worthess crap and very few bug fixes
- 2 knockdowns + spray on 3rd guy... 2 hit points shown on death screen
- DeSync is rediculous even though new 'net stats' say 2ms - 30ms all the time

I wish this game was good so badly!

Verdict: FK THIS GAME... changed recommend to 'No'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: 440 hours

- Hackers have gone way down but still exist
- Based on the last update it seems like PUBG Corp is stepping it up.  Map selection, new weapon, Miramar tree additions.

It's the game I love to hate again.  Keep it up!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: 350 hours

- Hackers have come out of everywhere!
- > 50% hackers.   The other 50% I may just die too early to see them.
- Squad play yesterday down to 3 or us vs 1... 3 headshots... Loss

This is becomming more frequent and today BluHole press release for new crates and microtransaction garbage.
I still play because it is fun up until the cheaters but this game is being killed off quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

250hrs in and still loving it (love/hate relationship).

Personally, solo is fun, but duo and squads are much more enjoyable. Version 1.0 has it's issues, but the huge improvements (vaulting, fps,lag,disconnects, ..) and the fun factors out-weigh these issues for me.

250 hours and I can confirm 2 or 3 hackers (speed/aim) and have had just as few questionables.  After reading these reviews it seems like others have hackers every game (or people they acuse of it because they get shot).  

Pros:
- Adrenaline rush!
- Co-op with friends
- Excellent graphics and frame rate after version 1.0 released (GTX 1060 6GB)
- Tasty chicken

Cons:
- Some hackers for me, 99% matches good (NA server 6pm-12pm EST mostly)
- Harassment with in-game voice leads to usually muting
-    Everyone seems to want me to f**k my mother in the lobby chat
-    Many times dieing in-game leads to a non-instigated verbal putdown
-    Most of the playerbase is fun, but there seems to be a 20% a-hole ratio

Now obviously people have played more than me but I have seen it since the beginning. Through out all the bugs and shitty glitches the game is alright. Now that they have finally made the game stable enough for me to play without shitting myself is fantastic. I think the game is now at the point where they can add new content. Hopefully this game lives on in the future. Still over hyped as fuck.

PROS:

+4 big maps
+Weapon mods with combinations
+Frequent updates and rebranding to make it fresh and new
+It CAN be fun gameplay. Not gonna lie the game is very fun once you learned the basics.
CONS:

-The game just wont boot up sometimes and will whenever it feels like it
-Uses Battleye 
-Bullshit fucking hit detection. I held a fuckign crowbar and SOMEHOW I couldn't land a hit on the enemy yet he fully killed me with his bare hands.
-Servers are too busy errors
-Crashes
-Soundtracks are terrible
-Crates within lootboxes
-Long a s s loading times. It's so long that the game loaded the whole thing and it's running but I'm stuck in the loading screen for a few minutes before I get dropped out of the plane.
-Hats are too large to fit the character's head
-Cheaters
-Crap outfit design. Do you ever wonder why Fortnite is a very success game? Because skins. Players can pay like 10 dollars to get their battle pass, and get skins along the way by doing challenges, plus some rewards even have in-game currency. That's amazing. This trash, however doesn't. Hell, even H1Z1 gives out free lootboxes and free cool clothes, unlike this trash. Hell, if you want to change your player's[strike] face, hair[/strike]  (now it free) gender you'll need to pay in-game currency and it's about... probably 2 days of full game time to have enough. How pathetic is that? 
Maps are way too large. For maps this huge I think it's about 250 PLAYERS to be enough to fit in these maps. It just takes forever to walk from one point to another I think they should add more vehicles.
-Bad, cheap a s s engine.
-No offline mode / bot mode
-Clunky gameplay. The first person and third person view felt unnatural and can get unpredictable at times when you're in close corners.
-So much uneccesary loading times like waiting a full minute before starting match when 100 people are joined like WTF were they thinking?
-Lack of features that other leading BR games use such as NEXT MATCH upon death
-Lifeless environments and lack of nature sounds
-Poor optimization
-Lack of MSAA setting
-Being hit by an enemy from afar is next to impossible to know which direction the bullet was fired from. In games like COD you will see traces of bullets fired however in this game it is impossible. You'll have to drive around like an idiot and possibly get shot to know where the enemy is hiding in and shooting from. 
-Extremely quiet sounds. The enemy sounds in this game like footsteps is so impossibly quiet to hear that I can't wrap it around my head how is this good idea for a game like this.

PUBG was the first Battle Royale game I played, when the genre was still new for me. I liked its style of playing, with the arena that got smaller over time, finding weapons to defend yourself against other players and the teamwork when playing with friends. 

My fun however, was short-lived with this game. This was mainly because I thought it looks and feels a little empty. I played many times with friends, and even then, I got this feeling. Normally when I play any game with friends, this is not the case, so for me, I knew that this was not a game that I would play for many years.

The graphics in PUBG are a little boring. I did not expect shiny next generation visuals or something, but everything is almost the same color, green grasslands with a orange sky. It looks kind of realistic, like everyday life, but the whole atmosphere just felt hollow. The sound effects from weapons are great and get close to realism.

The controls and movement are a little stiff and felt a little slow. This is mainly because of the big world you are walking in, making a mile really feel like a mile. 

My problem, as always, with this kind of games, is that I am just not skilled enough. I try very hard to stay alive and kill another player, but they are always faster than me. Well, in a game like Counter Strike for example, this is fine, I respawn immediately and can try again and might get some kills and streaks afterwards. But with games like PUBG, you walk around, collect stuff, do not see a living soul in sight and then *Bam*, dead. For me, the game is over and I need to find another server to play on. 

Then you got the fact that this game felt like Battlefield 2, my arch nemesis when talking online shooters. Massive open, empty world, walk for miles and miles, and then get shot. It was some sort of Vietnam flashback for me and I immediately disliked the game by the second.

The biggest problem, that has been patched if I am not mistaken, was that players could turn down their graphics to potato mode, in which grass and foliage disappeared. This gave them a huge advantage over players that were hiding in the grass to avoid being killed. For me, this almost killed all the fun I had with the game at the time. 

In the end, PUBG was fun for a couple of hours, and I had some joy with it, but with the knowledge of today, I prefer Apex Legends over this one anytime.

For me personally, I would not recommend this game.",1705960292,1705960292,False,1,0,0.511627912521362305,0,True,False,False

The game is still fairly well supported with new maps, guns, vehicles etc. being consistently added to the game. If another realistic BR game was released to compete with PUBG, I'd consider it, but I think the next step will be PUBG converting to Unreal Engine 5 and updating the graphics.

Many other battle royale games are goofy and less tactical in that you end up spamming movement, building etc just to be evasive. PUBG has leaning, recoil, bullet velocity and drop, attachments etc.  All of which feel really good for gun play mechanics. This is essentially the cs player's BR game.

This game is meant to be played in First Person Perspective (FPP) and in a Squad. The problem with Third Person Perspective (TPP) is that you don't have to expose your character to peak around a corner and dying to somebody that is abusing this mechanic feels really bad. Everybody is entitled to play what they enjoy, but the vast majority of players prefer FPP. If you're new, playing solo is going to feel bad as you have nobody to teach you or help you when you're facing sweaty veteran players. Try to find players to squad up with by queuing into squads and playing with your team. Then join the players that you enjoyed squading with if they're willing to add you. Practice your recoil control in practice mode and team death match to get better. If you only ever play normal BR mode, you only get a few opportunities to fight a player who is better than you before being sent back to the lobby. Team Death Match fixes that and gives you attempt after attempt to learn to play against more experienced players. Pay close attention to sound cues from footsteps or gunfire as this is critical to being able to react quickly. It's a bit of an uphill climb for new players but if you've played other shooters you should be alright if you stick with it.

I've found that as the game has matured, the community has gotten a lot more close knit and friendly which is actually nice. I seldom am stuck playing alone at this point. There are plenty of times where I can recognize players in the kill feed and know what I'm up against.

People complain constantly about cheaters, but in most cases, if you're really being honest with yourself and watch your deathcam, the player that killed you was just better. Every now and then I die to players that are suspect but it's actually fairly rare. Most of the time, you're dying to somebody with thousands of hours on the game (since this game is nearly 7 years old) who CAN actually turn on a dime and double headshot you from 100 meters away. I know this may seem ridiculous but if you watch pro players, you'll see that it is actually possible. Sometimes I surprise myself with the shots that I hit as one of those players. Actual cheaters are banned on a weekly basis, and it does seem like the developers are doing what they can to combat cheating. The fact that the game is free to play is always going to present a problem though where anybody that is determined enough to cheat will simply create a new account to cheat on when their current account gets banned.

All in all, there isn't a game out there that provides the same level of strategy and tension that you get from PUBG, and I look forward to Unreal Engine 5 giving the game a much needed graphics overhaul.",1705952443,1705953045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got shot by a guy while he was in the middle of Vaulting through a window. And apparently the people at the head office don't even get how recoil works, or they would ban the countless people using scripts. Fewer cheaters than their used to be, but recoil scripters are the worst as NOTHING will happen to them. Lots of supposed new players with what seems like pro level skills showing up. (Should say New accounts) They put the maps on rotation so you get the same ones over and over, with little variation other than crap no one wants. Weather and ""dark"" maps are extremely unnecessary. And the game promotes instantly killing down opponents, since they have a chance of getting back up with a ""Self AED"". I play on the weekend casually. And run into all kinds of people, good and bad at the game. But the same ones that ""cheat"" are always there.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. ",1542320774,1705883869,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The developers tried their best to make this game survive this long. This game will always be remembered as a legend that captured the interests of every single gamer at some point in his or her life. Buy the game. 

Updated Fourth Review: I guess I'm back on for this game. A lot has been added making me feel as though the game is alright.

Updated Third Review: This game is absolute trash. Finally deleted it from my computer.

Updated Second Review: The optimization is getting so much better and just love how the devs are really trying to make this game even more epic.

Bought copy when it was released, got busy, only to find out later that it's been made free (WTF???). Now, hacking is obviously prevalent. I play casually for the challenge. Killing someone who is obviously cheating is a reward I settle for. Forget actually winning a game - those times are gone as there are too many people cheating and the anti-cheat system is very weak. With Krafton sacking employees currently due to the global economic climate and general greed, it ensures that things regarding cheating will not improve over time. To Krafton: Regular rounds of banning accounts permanently of proven cheaters/hackers would be a start.

EDIT: Krafton suspends accounts but not ban. I suspect some devs earning some side hustle selling cheats/""services"" otherwise any known form of cheating would be patched by now but I guess there's more money to be had this way, right? Really-poor effort. Players will respond kindly with their wallets and game time.

EDIT: So you spend time queuing for a match with delays on the intro, people only get to live once - no respawn, the world gets smaller, and people playing as if it's Counter Strike?

--- PROS:
- PUBG Community is very friendly due to I have made many in-game friends and real friends too because of PUBG worldwide. 
- PUBG is love, PUBG is family.
- Skin collector community is big and cool

--- CONS:
- A game full of bots and tons of cheaters
 - Developer company (Krafton) is super greedy and doesnt give a f*** about western market due to all his sponsors/investors are mostly from Asia. 
- Positive impact by community feedback is non-existent and shadowed by Devs
- Skin design is lame and repetitive (Re-colored skins are often found in-game store)

****Ye still love it, i find myself coming back to pubg here and there, playing a few months then taking a few months rest. Its fun, some cheaters here and there, but honestly... i'll see one a month if that. The posts screaming about hackers and cheaters are cry babies that are probably just terrible at the game. So don't let that stop you jumping in and having some fun. It'll take a while to get used to the somewhat heavy movement feel, gun play and attachment management ...but its easy enough to google what attachments work best for what ever weapons you find yourself enjoying. Updates are regular and they keep trying new things here and there with promotional events and such things to keep your interest peaked.There are a few annoyances but on top of that there's a lot of fun to be had. Where else could i beat to death a crying kid on open mic with a frying pan and at the same time have one of my randomly assigned  team mates squeal like a pig down his mic as i get the kill. The community is a good laugh and i regularly find myself loling hard at the comments and characters that reveal themselves on the open mic feature. 
Jump in, have a laugh, shoot some plebs, then get told your mums an ape by a 12 year old on open mic. its a blast.****


Original review:

After a couple weeks play i can safely say this games a pretty good waste of your time :D reading a lot of reviews some good some bad, i decided to give it a go anyway... and i found it to be real good fun.
I've played a number of different royal games over the last year and this one comes top of my list.
I've come across no cheaters in games, nothing game stopping at all. Its good fun solo and great fun in squads.
If you like shooters which require you to gear up then go on the hunt whilst being sneaky and being tactical minded you will love this game.
Plenty of depth, which will take a good few hours to get used to and master.... but once you do it all feels like second nature and you'll be head shotting unsuspected players in no time.
I think most of the negetivity for this game came from the earlier days when cheaters were rampant and region locking wasnt a thing (China no:1).  Now thats all been sorted out i would say give it a go.
Its still one of the top played games on steam and servers are always full no matter what time of day or night it is.
Still a great play and well worth the price.",1549053262,1705611368,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

RNG cosmetics that go for hundreds of dollars on the steam market and come out of loot crates.

No real incentive to play more than one match, gets boring really fast, especially the games where the stupid circle mechanic ends in an open field where the few people left are just prone waiting on someone else to move. It's not hard to get into the top 5 at all, just hide and wait...BOOOORING!

A game that once stood as a pinnacle of the battle royale genre, now finds itself shackled by an insurmountable problem: an epidemic of cheaters that has left the gaming experience in shambles. As an avid supporter of the game, it's disheartening to witness the degradation of fair play at the hands of those who exploit and manipulate PUBG's mechanics with blatant disregard for the principles of integrity. The issue of cheating has reached such alarming proportions that it feels as if PUBG Corporation has relinquished control of its own creation, allowing an unchecked proliferation of aimbots and wall hacks to run rampant.

Despite promises of improved anti-cheat measures, the reality on the ground paints a different picture. PUBG's feeble attempts to curb cheating have proven ineffective, leaving players to navigate a virtual battlefield marred by the constant threat of encountering dishonest players. The once-thrilling engagements that defined PUBG's appeal are now overshadowed by the fear that each firefight may be tainted by the presence of a cheater, eroding the trust and enjoyment of the player community.",1705579427,1705579427,False,317,27,0.88878941535949707,18,True,False,False

The game also gives out a lot of free rewards through log-in events and other seasonal events that appear almost every week/month that provide a rewarding feeling for playing and logging in which keeps the player base alive, a feature a lot of other games could do with.

It also usually has a good battle pass with A LOT of rewards in in it where you don't feel bad for buying it, given that it also gives G-COIN at the end of it usually I think also helps.

Honestly a solid game, with solid rewarding game play and a rather generous distribution of items, which is only a good thing as it makes you want to play the game even more.

The blatant cheating is somewhat under control,  the game segregates advanced players  from newbies (and under-skilled, like me), there is a lot of refinement, weapons,  in-game challenges (daily, weekly, etc.), some crafting, incredible character customization, but most  of all... it's fun again.

wishlist? I paid full price, in year one. I wish they hadn't opened up the game to everyone (e.g.  ""free"") since that just encourages cheating (through the use of burner accounts, once caught). I wish the game could offer the ability to only play with others who paid, but then maybe it's okay as-is.


Former review, from 2020:
An unplayable mess. PUBG was fun in the beginning, then dominated by Chinese cheaters which chased away the fan base. I came back today, after almost a year away to see how it's doing. Incredibly, the game is profoundly worse! Two crashes in three games, loads of lag, teleportation, freezes when opening the overlay menu, etc. PUBG had its moment in the sun when it was unique, exciting, and novel. That was long ago. Now it feels like just another cash grab for paid content. Uninstall.",1579817675,1705461721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But hey, that's the charm of PUBG – where the chicken dinners are as elusive as my sense of direction.

Let's talk about the graphics. PUBG's landscapes are so breathtakingly realistic that I often find myself admiring the scenery while an enemy sniper admires the back of my head. The attention to detail is so precise that you can almost smell the virtual grass as you desperately crawl toward cover, hoping the enemy misses their shots.

Now, the looting system – it's like a virtual Black Friday, except instead of discounted TVs, you're fighting for the last energy drink like it's the elixir of life. I spend more time scavenging for bandages than I do in my actual kitchen looking for snacks. And don't get me started on the constant struggle to find a decent pair of pants – fashion in PUBG is truly a life-or-death decision.

The map is massive, and if there's one thing PUBG has taught me, it's that I'm geographically challenged. I can't count the number of times I've sprinted towards what I thought was the safe zone, only to realize I'm headed straight into a war zone. My character's cardio is on point, but my map-reading skills are about as reliable as a chocolate teapot.

Let's address the sound effects – the footsteps, the gunfire, the distant explosions – it's like an immersive ASMR experience, only with added adrenaline and the occasional expletive when you realize someone's camping in the bathroom you just walked into.

In summary, PUBG is a rollercoaster of emotions – from the thrill of parachuting into battle to the agony of being eliminated by someone with a username like ""NoobSlayer9000."" It's a game where strategy meets chaos, and your survival depends on your ability to find a decent helmet and not panic when the circle starts closing in. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Just be prepared to question your life choices as you sprint across an open field with nothing but a frying pan for protection.

And let's not forget about PUBG's newest Rondo map with markets – because nothing says intense battle royale like haggling for supplies while avoiding sniper fire.

The markets in Rondo are like the chaotic bazaars of the virtual world. I spend more time bargaining with virtual vendors for ammo than I do negotiating my salary in real life. I can almost hear my character yelling, ""Can I get a discount on these painkillers? I'm a loyal customer!""",1499328887,1705222870,False,0,0,0.444444417953491211,66,True,False,False

I'd rather play that junky old alpha-beta with tons of lags, stuttering and poor performance that was fun and populated, than this modern parody of once a great game!

It is filled with tons of useless maps nobody asked for nor wants to play, ugliest cosmetics geared towards Asians and re*rded kids, tons of paid crap they try to push down your throat every minute, 5 min deathmatch where you spend 2 minutes to find a new game and to wait for other people to connect, an over complicated unintuitive menu, long que times, netcode issues (yes, still), cheaters (I played only few games and some DM after 2 years break and already received a confirmation that person I reported was banned), bots and no-life nerds spraying you down from miles away and hitting every shot. Not to mention game still struggles to run on a top-tier hardware at stable 144+ fps at ultra settings.

578080,30823933,76561198070682954,610,106,26,0,26,1490825561,"{TL;DR} Buggy game with a bad dev team that is over run by cheating Chinese players on every server because the devs wont add a ping limiter to lock them to the Asian servers.

Seeing as how my last review was a bit outdated, I’m going to update this. I would still like to point out that I wrote this review back around the time when the game first came out and it was still at like a 80% positive score because I knew this would happen. And everyone who left a comment back then... well they didn't age well. Now… For the sake of organization and so this doesn’t turn into a book, I’m going to split all the problems into categories. 

[b]Gameplay[/b] : The whole premise of this game is you fly into the map on a plane and you jump out with 100 other players and try to survive. The first problem comes with this game’s engine. It cannot support 100 players on the same map at the same time. It can only support around 75 or so. Meaning for the first section of the game, you will be lagging. Any items you try to pick up you will have to pick up at least 10 times before it goes into your inventory. Also the beginning of the game is awful. It is basically people running around to find a gun, and if you don’t find one fast enough then the enemy will find one and kill you instantly. Players lag and even if you shoot them it wont register a hit because of ping. The game runs awful. Only beefy computers can run this game, even though it isn’t impressive graphics wise, because it is unoptimized and coded awfully. On top of this most people turn off a lot of the settings like foliage or shadows and so on so they can see players from farther away. So they are just useless settings in the end hindering the games performance unless forced to be used or removed. Also a lot of the game is just camping and being prone so no one sees you as you  shoot people from far away. That is what 80% of all your deaths are going to be after you get past the unfair beginning section of trying to find a gun. 

[b]Community[/b] : Due to the dev teams refusal to add a ping limiter every server has a ton of Chinese people. This leads to joining a US server, hearing people screaming “China numba whon” a bunch, and half the players on the US server lagging or being unkillable because of their bad ping. They are purposefully joining US servers because they know this. This game is also over run by Chinese hackers, which Playerunkown said himself that most of the cheaters are coming China.
Just look at this screenshot from the steam discussion forum. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169782535] >LINK<[/url]
You may think that is the Chinese language tab in the discussions page. Nope. That is general discussions on a daily basis. It’s filled with Chinese spam.

[b]Dev Team[/b] : Unprofessional. Back around the time the game first came out, people raised issues about the Chinese people joining the american servers, being hard to kill due to poor ping, and being obnoxious by screaming slurs or using aimbots to Playerunkown. People requested the addition of a ping limiter. Unknown's response was to call these people racists. Since then they have made special censored versions of this game for China and this game's playerbase is made up of over 60% chinese people. The reason why this is a problem is the dev team admitted that over 90% of the hackers are coming from China. The dev team also said they would not add loot boxes until they left Early Access but added them early anyways. Because why not, they could use more money even though their game is a top selling game all the time. The stuff in the loot boxes aren’t even that good tbh. Who cares about a yellow shirt when your being shot, it just makes you easier to see and get sniped. The dev team also threatened to sue Fortnite for making a better Battle Royal game than they did. Because the developers are delusional and believe they created and own the Battle Royal genre, they went ahead and sued Fortnite in a Korean court of law along with some smaller Battle Royal games. They are mad that their game isn't the most popular game ever, because they are greedy and lazy about fixing problems. On top of that, technically PUBG was actually a stolen formula taken from H1Z1. So they are just being hypocrites. The dev team goes as far as to ban people who honk car horns at streamers because “we need to appeal to the people marketing our game”. Also, the fact that you can team-kill in the game and get banned for it is ridiculous. If they don’t like people team-killing, maybe they should disable it instead of banning people and stealing their money for doing it. These devs are so incompetent that they let their source code leak and now there are tons of mobile PUBG rip off games in China that uses their code and actually run better than PUBG somehow. 

[b]Verdict[/b] : If you crave this kind of gameplay, go play Fortnite or CoD or any number of the battle royale clones that greedy companies made to capitalize on the trend.",1490834358,1704957747,False,61,6,0.575899779796600342,23,True,False,False

It was so new and fresh in the beginning. There was nothing else like it. You and your friends had fun for hours and hours. Laughing hysterically at crazy vehicle mechanics. Bitching about rats, sweats, red zones and unlucky circles. As the honeymoon phase wore off you started to notice their little issues. They started to annoy you more and more. Eventually it got so bad you gave up on them for good. Had a huge fight and went your separate ways. Good riddance. You thought your life was better. You dated Apex for a while but that spark wasn’t there. You fooled around with Warzone and something was just missing. Hell you even got into a long term relationship with Tarkov. But the entire time you were comparing them to PUBG. You heard they went free to play. Wow desperate much? Was that just a ploy to get your attention? Were they thinking about you this whole time too? Well the rats in EFT have gotten so bad it’s unplayable… Should we.. give this another try? Wow okay the performance is actually improved, looks like they learned a thing or two while they were discovering theirselves. Damn theres still seemingly random crashes every %$@&ing day, but you know what, you’re home. This is where you were meant to be. Even with its little quirks, how its evolved over time, nothing compares to you.

Your camera angles are shit, I die from a player coming around a corner tilting, I don't even see him when he shoots me. I watch the death cam, he can see half my head while i am staring right back at him and see nothing. Shit game.

2/12/2023-
More cheaters then actually gamers. Company does nothing to fix this. 

8/12/2021 - Its now open season for hackers and scripters. Most players have perfect recoil in high recoil guns like Beryls and AKs. Headshots from people 100m away on automatic fire is the new norm. It doesn't matter what they say that the game doesn't have many cheaters when I have played for a month again and have had over 10 people banned. Game is shit. Wont change. Uninstall...

12/12/18 - Game is still trash. First Person mode. Top 10, see a guy run past me and he sees me at the last moment as he goes behind a tree. Suddenly I am shot to pieces? Wtf happened? I watch his death cam, he sees me the entire time behind the tree. My point of view I can not see him, from his, my ENTIRE BODY is visable. WTF brown hole. Get your camera angles correct for EVERYONE!!! If I cannot see him, how the fuck can he see me. I watched the dead cam 3 times and my own death. This is the 2nd to 3rd time this has happened. Piece of shit.

12/29/18 - If im on the second floor and enemies are on the outside of my building climbing on things to get to the second floor, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU MAKE THE SOUND COME FROM THE FIRST FLOOR. PUG junk.

01/10/19 - Cheating still going on. Comfirmed Cheater - Name - ""Mamhi""

3/6/19 - The amount of aim hacks and scripts is a joke, people shooting with little to no recoil. When their cursor is sitting in a perfect up and down moving without any side to side movement shooting an akm with no comp, nice scripts no skill player.

3/25/19 - I can't figure out why it takes 5 days for an aim bot and map hacker to get banned. Shooting both my duo and I through trees and automatic fire 200 meters away with a red dot. We couldn't even see him through multiple trees. Another BIG fucking issue is that the people with the perfect recoil, I can hold a good recoil but it still bounces around in a small circle, watching death cams with guys unloading an entire clip with it ONLY bouncing slightly up and down. Nice scripts. Blue hole figure a way to get these guys as well as it is very similar to aim bots, it IS cheating.

4/9/19 - Bluehole just can't get a hold of it. The amount of people i suspect are cheating and then report them to get the screen the next time i log in that the person i reported was actually cheating is banned, the quantity is a joke and since the recent patch, it has been hell playing. The most recent has been extreme cheating to people auto-knowing where you are. Take long shot with a VSS, hide, peek and get shot in the face instantly. Get it together.

4/22/19 - New update new cheaters. Got the videos to prove it, reported them, been 3 days and still no bans. Bluehole the brownhole.

5/12/19 - Dying behind cover a half second behind it is getting really old. All the death cams show complete cover when the last shot is fired and my character is completely in cover when i die. Brown F Hole has shit programming and server stability. Can't wait for a company who actually gives a damn.

5-17-19 - Another cheater today named KONGLING-CAPP. Deathcam was weird getting snipped through tree with 3 perfect shots. Went back into the game and watched him play. He knew where everyone single player was. Next day he was banned.

6-17-19 - BrownHole, you think if out of 14 games 12 of them end in a head shot in automatic gun fights that something is a problem. Your servers are shit.

9-25-19 - I and all my friends are about done with this game. The game crashes constantly, our gaming comps are meant to game with high specs with no issues with other games BUT this one. Game freezes, turn graphics down to medium, game is still crashing and freezing once per 3 games. Seems my game is almost half a sec behind, lagging almost so enemies have that upper hand. Its very poor programming. Very poor servers. I love the concept of this game but Pubg fails.

1-6-2020 - Your game is still royally shitty. Frames per second drop constantly, Server  lag, and since your newest patch of sound updates where someone can be a 3rd of a square away on the map jumping up and down , running, and I can't hear him at all....makes perfect sense. Your game is a disappointment and continues to be one. Server lag and frames per sec should be a pretty high priorty and you still haven't figured it out.

10-19-2020 - This game is trash. The developers don't give a damn about the US or UK players. The server are trash where people from out of server area can come in and insta kill us from ping. Doesn't even show that you are hit once or twice, just insta death. Cheaters are still rampant throughout the game, 3 weeks ago guy is shooting us from inside terrain, aimbot, 6x scope auto fire, watching people through walls and terrain. The server ping is the largest issue right now as I can go back and watch 3-4 bullets hit with blood splat, shows him only take one and im dead. Also take shots from around corners, peek, shoot, back behind cover when you take a shot because server still thinks you are outside of cover. I wish these developers would get their act together, but guess what, they made millions, now they just fuck us with poor service.

9-15-2021 - 
Game is dead. 2 guys killed me and my full team crossing a bridge , not 2 while driving half way across and then killed the other two coasting by. auto aim, perfect aim on auto fire. Game is shit.

6-2-2022
Game has improved and failed at the same time. Cheaters are still there, a joke watching the death cams with them shooting high recoil guns with no recoil at all. Game crashes every 1st or 2nd game even with having a high end comp.

1/9/2024 - Your weekly gaming bans tell it all. In one week you have a problem of 60,000 - 124,000 players banned.

Out of all the arena-style shooters, PUBG is by far the best. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws. It has a ton.

Recently the game has had some [i]interesting[/i] marketing choices and poor playerbase treatment (i.e. banning ""stream snipers"" who weren't actually stream sniping)

It is hard to recommend at $30 however because the game does not offer a lot in the customization market without spending money or [i]grinding[/i] (which if you enjoy that then to each their own).

As it is today? PUBG has been acquired by KRAFTON Inc, a company that has absolutely no interest in maintaining anything like fun. and have done nothing since the acquisition but try to find new ways to make money off the player unknown name, and players that want nothing more than to see it return to what it was.

PUBG mobile is the chief example of this, a soulless husk of a game they created ONLY to make money off people that liked the original game, even though they had long scalped the fun from the game by the time mobile launched.

This game is great for people who want to torture themselves or hate themsevles, it's like a slow act of self harm. 

I've played this game for a few years now since launch, and I think I'm pretty damn good. Excellent at sniping, and can mow down a whole 4 man w/ the AK or Beryl at full auto. It's the most realistic shooter and have wall grabbing now. I play Solo or Duo 4 man Squad, as in I'm always solo or in a duo against 4 man squads. My KDR 1.63 in the last 6 months, and 1.45 over all. 

I just got 1 shotted with 100%HP and a 100% HP lvl 3 helmet by an M24 when I can't even down someone with an M24 when they have a lvl 2 helmet. The amount of client side lag, hacks and bullshit luck that allows worse players to beat me in this game is infuriating and I have dealt with it for 3 years but that 1 shot lvl 3 helmet was the last straw. 

This game, I always feel like I have the drop to just destroy a whole team, but the shitty controls are getting in the way. Shooting window sills, shooting ledges, shooting ceilings, accidentally vaulting off a 6 story (i have vault separately bound for years now.) dumb physics just bumping you the right way to just fall off something. I'm always just battling the fucking game when if it was another engine I'd have taken everyone out. Pretty frustrating. 

I am just over playing 20 matches to have 1 good one where I'm lucky enough to not have the lag/engine/physics/controls fuck me out of winning. I can't play that many games to ACTUALLY play a REAL game of PUBG. It's a waste of my god damn time.

There are still a lot of hackers who toggle, and there is still so much client side lag you will get shot in the past or behind walls constantly or get downed by one shot when the lag allowed for multiple? I've died instantly with full Lvl 3 armor from weak ass guns instantly that I just can't play this shit anymore. Over it.

EDIT:
I still have cancer, and it's called ""PUBG Glider Edition.""

EDIT 2:
They killed Vikendi for the second time. That was the only thing keeping me coming back. Every holiday season we'd all come back and play Vikendi.. but they nuked it... a second time... long live Volnova.

EDIT 3:
Game is now FTP. 50% or more Bots, other half a lot of hackers or people who don't know how to play. Many of the original towns and areas have been scrapped and have been set up to be more noob friendly so the veterans don't own too hard.

Probably one of the funnest games i have played, with friends in a long time. still have some lag problems here and there but over all its a lot of fun 2021 this game is crap they have no way to detect if your using a script on ur mouse and im 99% sure they are the ones selling cheats. getting money from selling a copy of the game everytime someone gets banned for using there cheats they sell. there is no way they have such a problem with cheaters with the amount of money they have made ""63,445,172.00""

as of 10/15/23 i would say this is the worst it has been for having cheaters in the game no recoil, people know where you are, with out any inkling you are there, replays FTW. there anti cheat system is crap they say they ban so many accounts but there problem is its now free to play, they cant actually do a darn thing about it. they say they have hard-where bans but it isnt any good because not everyone plays ranked. if you wanna avoid a head-ach go play something else, minesweeper would be better",1511552931,1704539884,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

★☆☆☆☆ - Deeply Disappointing After Years of Commitment
As a long-time player of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, with over 3000 hours invested since late 2018, it's with a heavy heart and deep frustration that I write this review.
My journey with this game has been a rollercoaster. The early days were filled with excitement, challenges, and a community that brought endless hours of enjoyment. However, recent experiences have completely overshadowed these fond memories.
The primary issue began with the game's anti-cheat system. Despite my commitment and fair play, the system repeatedly failed to load on my PC. This technical glitch led to a message stating, ""Your game will be shut down in 10 seconds. Verify your PUBG game integrity from Steam."" Following all the suggested steps, including verifying game files and restarting my PC, I hoped for a resolution.
But then, the final straw: a sudden and shocking 72-hour ban. There are no explanations, no support, just a blunt and unjustified punishment for an issue that seems entirely on their end. This isn't an isolated incident but a recurring problem that has destroyed the fun and fairness of the game.
Contacting the support team yielded no real help, only adding to the frustration. It feels like a slap in the face to a loyal player. Spending thousands of hours in a game world should build a relationship of trust and respect, but this has been completely eroded.
It's heartbreaking to say, but PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is no longer the game I fell in love with. What used to be an escape into a thrilling world has turned into a source of annoyance and disappointment. To anyone considering this game, please be wary. The game has its highs, but when the lows hit, they hit hard, especially when your commitment is met with unjust bans and unhelpful support.",1703904875,1704400241,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, at this point, I cannot recommend it, first of all because of how poorly it is optimized.

I have to turn almost everything in graphics settings to low or very low for the game to be playable. My current hardware is pretty decent (6-core CPU, 16Gb RAM, Radeon R9 R380), and, while it is a little bit old indeed, it handles Witcher 3 on Ultra good enough. Yet apparently it's barely enough for PUBG. Here are the *minimum* system requirements that are stated right now on store page: ""Intel Core i3-4340 / AMD FX-6300, 6 GB RAM, nVidia GeForce GTX 660 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB"".

I have to say that, to me personally, it feels more optimized after 1.0 release, so maybe it will get better over time.

I hope I will be able to change review to positive one after there will be more optimisations done, or when I'll give gaming PC a significant hardware upgrade. :)

Update 04-2021: still cannot recommend it, it's still not optimised. Two significant hardware upgrades later it still requires a lot of tweaks to run on decent framerate.

Update June 2020:
- Microtransactions all over the place
- Not able to play a single match without at least one or two hackers.
- 3 Years of ""improvement"" still clunky as hell
- C4 placed at the front door kills you on the roof af a 3 story on the other side of the house...

- Devs listen to community wishes (at least the german community manager asks a lot for feedback)
- Content is rising steadily and game improves with every patch
- play it since march '17 for almost 700 hours now and I'm still not bored.

In comparison to other Battle Royale games, PUBG stands out for its realism, whether in terms of the environment, weapons, or overall game physics. The game relies more on tactics and caution, requiring players to watch every corner and stay vigilant at all times. Currently, all of this has been overshadowed by the new and sophisticated Warzone; however, for its loyal players, myself included, PUBG still holds its charm, and I always enjoy returning to it. Weaker computers may struggle with the gameplay, but it's manageable. One aspect that bothers me the most about the gameplay is the slowness and lack of dynamism in the game. However, as I've already mentioned, the game is designed for a realistic battlefield experience, so it's something to be expected.

The game's dealing with a bunch of issues – cheaters everywhere, weapons that feel off, and gameplay that's just not cutting it anymore. Even big-shot streamers like Shroud and DrDisrespect bailed on PUBG streaming because it's just not pulling in the crowds like it used to.

What's really grinding gears is how the devs seem to care more about pumping out skins for a game that feels like it's on life support. Core issues with the gameplay? They're not getting the attention they deserve. The lack of a solid anti-cheat system is like an open invitation for cheaters to ruin the fun for those of us who used to dig PUBG.

It's a bummer seeing the focus on making money from skins instead of fixing what's broken. If you're thinking of dropping some cash on a game, you might want to look elsewhere. PUBG's in a bit of a sorry state right now, and there are plenty of other games out there offering a better time.",1704122555,1704122555,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been temporarily banned 4 times in a month even though I'm 100% sure I haven't violated any terms of service. This is not an isolated case, I have found countless other cases of people in the exact same spot. Even people that have been wrongfully permabanned only to get unbanned after months when PUBG inevitably realizes their mistakes.

The support you get always comes down to 'we can't help you due to security reasons'. 

Also, they install software on your computer that monitors it 24/7, even when you're not playing pubg.

Don't believe me ? check out Battlenonsense on youtube. The game takes getting killed round corners to a whole new level. I constantly see 4/5/6 hit markers on players only for them to turn round and 1/2 shot kill me. You may as well just roll a dice because even if you have a player stone cold it means nothing in this game as more often than not they will quite likely kill you.

Yes it is Early Access, but dire netcode and the creep of cheating and hackers will send this game the same way as TKOTK. Players constantly sit in the blue zone pumped on energy drinks/tablets it makes getting to the safe zone pointless. The so called patch improvements to the game have made no difference and i would argue the game is no better than it was on launch only it now has hackers and cheats

Back in 2024 and this game has more cheats in than legit players. This is confirmed by the DEVs themselves where in one week in November 65000 accounts were banned the majority of which were cheats.

Hackers are actually nowhere near as prevalent as they were in EA. TKers, griefers, AFKers actually do get banned when reported and if you want it to happen within an hour you can submit video evidence to support and they actually ban them. Their support is actually amazing as I even reported an alternate account they logged in with and flagged the account for manual review. The alternate account they logged into was also banned because they started to TK on it as well. Support actually does their job and does it very well. You can get A LOT of cosmetics for free without even paying just by playing the game consistently. Honestly this is by far the most generous battle royale game as far as giving away cosmetics. I have spent less than $10 on this game yet I have over $100 worth of cosmetics just from free BP and G-coin that the game rewards with less than 300 hours in.

Surprisingly the game has improved, it is still the same PUBG at its core but the amount of hackers has died down significantly. This could be due to the lower playercount as the game is past its golden age, but the game is actually pretty enjoyable now.

There are a lot of free items you get if you grind out time in the game to unlock them during their event window. I'm actually surprised that the game has turned it around decently well. Definitely worth a try again.

A LOT of negative reviews are old and even more are from players that get clapped and cry hacks. The hacking problem has significantly gotten better from when I last played.",1491988877,1703908623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Full of chinese hackers on NA, SA, OCE, EU, dont expect a fair battle or a random squad mate that speaks anything besides chinese.

As for the 29.12.2023 PUBG is in it's best state when it comes to content/bugs/cheaters, and I've been playing this game with breaks ever since it was released(2017).

What's worth mentioning - I'm speaking about the experience of EU FPP player.
NA/OCE has WAY worse experience due to longer queue times, some modes being close to non existing due to lack of playerbase etc.

I highly recommend this game under one of two conditions:
1. You like playing solo
2. You have people to play duo/squads with

Otherwise - I wouldn't play it at all.

The game really shines If you have a full squad of people to play with.

There are cheaters(thanks to f2p model...), but they're constantly being banned.
It's way better than in early/late 2022 or early 2023.

Rondo is an amazing map and it's early roadmap(till February 2024) looks really promising.

I wish the Devs would also listen to EU/NA community and their feedback, not only Asian. I personally wish the game would have more 'camo like' type of skins rather than a bear/panda/toy/pink madmanlike skins. 
Tho, I can't really complain as I have a huge amount of skins, lol.

Playerbase is pretty loyal, full of veterans that know what they do so newbies will most likely get wiped pretty fast, but well... the game is just enjoyable and offers emotions no other game has.",1511201360,1703815994,False,0,0,0,12,True,False,False

The first issue you'll run into is the optimization. It has mostly stayed the same since the launch of the game. It isn't delightful, although the game looks like stitched-up Unity assets. Thank god this game is free now and not like it used to be. My second point is the gameplay. The recoil feels terrible, and the FP camera looks quite clunky compared to the TP point of view. The movement is bizarre. Sometimes, it feels like you're sliding on the floor, and sometimes, your character can barely move. While the game's unforgiving aspect can be adrenaline-pumping in moments when nothing is happening, the game can feel like a walking simulator. Yes, that aspect also extends to other BR games, but in PUBG, it shows because of the size of the maps.

Along with its unforgiving nature, it creates really unfun situations in which you're often killed before you even have time to react. Along with it comes lots of controversies the game and dev team had through its lifespan, like, for example, releasing an unfinished and broken port **** for consoles when the game itself still needs to be fully finished. 

Apart from that, cheating is still an unfortunately unsolved problem. And it's a big enough problem to ruin your enjoyment of the game.

I should be able to get keep a constant 60fps, but it dips. THIS IS HORRIBLE! You spent all that beta money on the crate system. 

Also, the maps still have huge bugs/clips that will buck you off the motorcycle and kill you. How is this still a problem? 

The netcode for this game is trash aswell. Expect to get shot through walls.

I played alot maybe there is a problem with they hours but I was playing since the Arma 3 mod.

The MOBILE version of this game played on PC have better mechanic and less cheater. 

Putting the game free is what you can call the worse mistake they made its sure people will go and buy you in-game currency but cheating will get to every games.

This game had great potential but putting it free is the thing that make player like me that where fan since the beginning in Arma 3 Battle Royal Mod don't play a lot of hours. 

I don't think putting it 40 $ would change a thing because you cannot remove the free purchase the people mad and hacker probably have a load of account in case you do that so putting the game free make it useless to anymore. 

Either that the mechanic is hard, and player that don't cheat are really over power and they are in any game that mean if you never play you will get in front of a max level with thousand of years experience and get rekt 360 no scope at 2 kilometre. I am good with these type of game and when I play its always like that the matchmaking is shit and even if they put it free they don't have any more player because game are taking 2 to 5 minute in the North America server. 

I recommend to people that wan to put a lot of hours to get good enough to compete with the high level if you can do it its a good game.

If you are not ready to play more than 200 hours before being able to make kill just don't login.",1522432893,1703438625,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment you parachute onto the diverse and expansive maps, PUBG immerses you in a world where survival is not just a goal but a relentless pursuit. The realistic graphics and attention to detail create an atmosphere that is both visually stunning and tactically challenging. Every footstep, gunshot, and rustle in the distance adds to the suspense, making each match a heart-pounding adventure.

One of PUBG's standout features is its commitment to realism. The gun mechanics are meticulously designed, requiring players to master recoil control and bullet drop for effective long-range engagements. This attention to detail extends to the environmental factors, including weather changes and dynamic terrain, ensuring that no two matches feel the same.

The game's expansive player base ensures quick matchmaking, and whether you prefer the solo experience, teaming up with a duo, or coordinating with a squad, PUBG offers versatile gameplay options. Teamwork and communication are paramount, creating a social aspect that enhances the overall gaming experience.

PUBG's commitment to staying relevant is evident through regular updates and additions. The developers introduce new maps, weapons, and gameplay enhancements, keeping the community engaged and excited for what's next. The evolving esports scene adds another layer of competitiveness, offering players the chance to showcase their skills on a global stage.

The variety of maps, each with its own unique challenges, adds a strategic element to the game. Whether navigating the dense forests of Erangel or battling it out in the urban sprawl of Sanhok, every location demands adaptability and tactical thinking.

In conclusion, PUBG on Steam is a must-play for anyone seeking a challenging and immersive battle royale experience. Its realistic gameplay, dynamic environments, and vibrant community make it a standout title in the genre.

After completing the useless tutorial mission, I'm allowed to join a match and it ends up being a sedate affair of looting empty buildings and shooting the occasional player so oblivious that I think they were bots. I jacked a car and drove around the map in search of something interesting to do, but quickly ran out of petrol.

So, so many in my old stream said, so many here said.....full of cheats. My opinion is yes, there can be cheats. I do not think it is as common as some may think. Yes I have been cheated on, well move on and shrug. If you cheat on a game, the feeling of success you will never feel, the pure greatness of winning without cheating, or even winning despite the cheats that can be there. The gun play is so nice. The design of maps, the pure love that has been put into this title, ensures this is my favourite game STILL after having bought it early. The hours I have streamed this, the practice and will not give attitude, the bad days, the good, the amazing experiences I have had in this glorious game I will never forget. Its better with others, solo is entirely ok. I liked the slower pace of earlier versions, but I understand the slow pace can put off the younger player (focus skills, the now now now element of life) well, I love a slow paced 'shoe leather' element that burnt slowly and then suddenly all hell breaks loose. Well, not quite that now, quicker, blue comes in quicker, smaller maps to keep the pace. Yeah, ok....for me would prefer the slow.....its like watching a good TV series over 10 episodes and enjoying it more because the pace changes, rather than a John WIck all action film. Well, that's all personal and JW not for me, but again I'm older than you possibly Played games since PONG and this is where we find gaming now, immersive, skill based and brilliant. For all those who have moaned, abandoned the game, stating cheat...what I have seen from streams and comments, my opinion is that it is that hard to play and win, that the person moaning has not played the required hours to become good enough. It can take 10000 hrs to perfect any action, but after 3.5K of hours, I'm good enough to expect a win here and there. For me the most go back to game ever. Yeah im 58,, yeah I might not be as fast as I used to be (biological but debatable) and THAT'S why this game is great, you can use tasctics and play smart and for someone with less than razor sharp reactions, its entirely possible to win with tactics.

Pros: 
         +nice idea at  the start of EA.
         +lot of different weapons
         +different playstyles
Cons:
           - cheaters. Just every game even with battleeye.
           - server desync.
           - cant play with friends overseas anymore
           

Summary review:
It was a nice game,one out of 1000 in my list who left EA with release, but the ignorance of dev team killed it. RiP
Strongly Not recommended to  buy...
The fall of 2023 update:
Steam no longer support win7. Farewell.

Update (January 14, 2020): They removed SEA servers. players in the Philippines all have above 150 pings. @PUBG_Support won't reply when i ask for help and their forums are useless. F U C K this game. 
Update (January 6, 2020): Definitely there's improvements like the guns would now spawn properly before you land but that should have been there in the beginning, and the cheaters are still there while I died twice from them just tonight, with my friends and the free ok microtransactions keeping me in this game. without them, I play other games.
Update (December 17, 2019): The cheaters are back.
UPDATE (Nov 5, 2019) : They added some new bugs to the game since October, including longer loading times and crashes between matches, and the always reliable return of cheaters on every update.
UPDATE (August 9,  2019) : Still a S H I T game

I've been in and out of this game for god knows how long, hopeful on every update, yet they still could not fix it. You dont deserve to get paid Bluehole. Only way to ""Fix PUBG"" is to be replaced by better games with better developers. Are better servers and better coding really that expensive and time-consuming to an international multi-million dollar company? Or are your priorities just  on the paid ugly microtransactions?
Update (Aug 31, 2021): I was happy for one season but now, frequent crashes almost every hour and it does not work with Rivatuner now. Better games have arrived. Bluehole still have not fixed their game.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!",1703027602,1703027602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is not the PUBG you fell in love with anymore. 
Almost every major change they've made since release has been a step backward as far core gameplay. Gliders, emergency pickups, bluezone bags, BRDMs. These and other gimmicky additions have completely altered the pacing of the game for the worse and don't need or deserve to remain in the game. 
These and other features and balance passes have really lowered the skill ceiling, but thankfully they removed the gadgets like the blue-chip detector and drone etc. 
Having so much gear everywhere means that having your favorite weapon isn't special at all.

Imagine this: you're parachuted onto a remote island with nothing but a shopping list. Your mission? To gather groceries while avoiding being turned into a human kebab by fellow shoppers. The supermarket is your battleground, and the aisles are your trenches.

Forget peaceful shopping. Here, it's all about grabbing that last can of beans like it's a gold bar in Fort Knox. And if you're lucky enough to find the frying pan, congratulations, you're now the Iron Chef of combat cookery. It's a game of hide-and-seek, but instead of hiding behind curtains, you're crouching in a bush with a sniper rifle, eyeing the frozen food section.

You'll form alliances only to have them crumble over who gets the last pack of ramen. And just when you think you've got a moment to breathe and admire the picturesque sunset, you remember there's a deadly force field shrinking around you, pushing everyone into the ultimate food fight finale.

In the end, whether you're the last one standing or get taken out by a rogue rolling pin, you'll leave with your heart racing and a newfound appreciation for peaceful grocery shopping.

Old review at 120hrs:
[spoiler] yea i used main pubg on mobile, then i switched over to PC and found it extremely hard to play or have any fun. the switch was night and day for me. maps are huge, more running to safe zone, long time to load into maps, harder to see enemy players etc. i gave up after a while.  
later when the free to play update dropped, i was able to invite my old pubg-mobile squad who didn't own the game, we grinded and its feels like pubg is whole new different experience. 
i had fun on pubg when playing with friends. it was hard... but fun [/spoiler]",1572447279,1702642394,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Don't actually play it anymore tho, rating it positively for the hundreds of hours of sheer adrenaline-inducing fun it provided back then. The introduction of bots totally killed it for me sadly. Before, knowing that every single interaction you'd have with another individual was 100% a human (and thus, super unpredictable) was the best.

""One of the better Battle Royal games out there as well as one of the first! Can be rather addictive so you have been warned but overall a rather fun experience. I look forward to many more years of enjoying this game!""

Now over six years later I can't understand what went wrong with this game and how far it has fallen. Its now an utterly buggy mess in their attempt to stay relevant and is barely playable with massive hardware updates that were completely unnecessary! And the sheer amount of FOMO from season to season has gotten so much worse that unless I had the Amazon Prime free rewards, I see no reason to continue playing it! 

It was fun for the time being but the sun has officially set on this game.

Despite the cheaters, you you believe like a fool, what pubg was...but probably soon I will also lose this faith in this game. I play pro, but above average. I played every day from the third season. This is to describe that I am not a beginner. In each game, I send a report, in each, out of 100 games, there are 99 reports and 99, in the reports there are 99 bans. But these bans are after 1 hour, which is quite good, but some are after 2-3 days. OK, which maybe good tetri. How can you spoil a game in 2-3 days for people who want to be good and develop themselves. Well, probably not in China. Who is the owner of this game. But we all know what goods are made in China, of course, original!! What's the story about? It's nice that the manufacturer informs about various improvements in the anti-cheat system, etc. But most likely, this is done in another game. Because it can't be that in the new season 27.1 there are already a pile of reports and a pile of bans. Then where are the anti-cheats? system. In my opinion, if you have something illegal related to the game, you will be banned immediately. But maybe it's just dreams and this game, well, it's PUBG MOBILE, nothing else. The only thing that is improved is the clothes, but also those there is probably a lack of ideas, if you can simply express yourself. In summary, if you want to play with cheats, then yes, you can play, but you can seriously forget about fairness in this game. I have played enough of this game to be able to express myself like this. Just count on the fact that the manufacturer has to spit on you.

tldr; Relatively highly recommend, just don't spend money in their purposefully obtuse cash shop.

Pretty much every aspect of the game has been vastly improved and de-sync, which was my biggest gripe at the time, is no longer an issue.

I can now recommend PUBG relatively highly.

Now my biggest gripes are related to the in-game cash shop and loot boxes, and the occasional and obvious cheaters. 

The cash shop and ""crafting"" is all designed to be as convoluted and confusing as possible. It's very difficult to tell exactly what it is you're buying into at all, and with three separate menus all devoted to their own separate micro-transaction/obfuscation methods, it's easily to spend a lot of money and get nothing of value in return, literally or figuratively. I would not recommend spending any money in any of their schemes and if you're going to buy anything at all, buy the items that are available through Steam marketplace.

Regarding the cheater situation, while they're not entirely common, their frequency is just enough to ruin 2-3 rounds a night.

PUBG pioneered the battle royal genre.
There are some things I'm not a fan of personally but overall PUBG is a great game and among the best FPS PVP in the world objectively for its gunplay, movement, environment, and physics.

TLDR

Pros
PUBG has the best bullet physics of any shooter I've ever played hands down.
The options you have in combat are diverse in a massive and detailed sandbox

Cons
Really, there's only one problem with this game for me: Pacing.
Im not a fan of having to find the equipment i want to use
This mechanic boils down to most of my experience being 99% shopping simulator 1% combat.
Also, the shrinking zone mechanic will often force fights youre not prepared for (by design).
Its a shame that because the ring forces constant movement, the opportunity to utilize the long range combat is rare.
Both of these ""cons are typically associated with the Battle Royal style so I can't say this is a PUBG problem exclusively.

However, there's an instant action mode that provides set loadouts for deathmatches if youre not up for the BR scenario

In contrast, Rainbow 6 Siege offers the the best pacing of any FPS I've played and brilliantly bypasses the bullet physics by design of close quarters scenarios.

All in all PUBG is an exceptional game and now its free.
(I bought it -_-)

That was written most likely over a year ago and here is the update!
Every game has bot players... they are just basically free kills, Hacking in this game is still a major issue and no change there. Basically just play Arma 3... much better game...

Yes I have over 3K hours in this game. I enjoy self inflicted pain. The game still has a major hacking issue. Hackers are not afraid of getting an account banned as it only takes 10 minutes to make a new account. Teams of 4 consists of 3 fixed players and 1 hacking individual to boosts the 3 non hackers. 

I recommend avoiding spending any money on this game as loot crate drops for anything ""Good"" is extremely low to rigged.

Update!

Game still has a major Hacker issue. Therse hackers are still not even hiding the fact they are hacking, such as flying cars and clipping through walls. The game is not friendly to newer players as the lobbies you will encounter will contain experienced players who will get 20 kills in that match.

최적화는 여전히.... RTX 3천번대 시리즈로도 144프레임이 힘들고,
무료화를 했지만 핵은 여전히 판치고,
총 스킨, 이모트만 파는 게임이 됐습니다...

이게... 한국 게임의 한 획을 그었던 그 게임이 맞나요
게임 자체는 너무너무 재밌어서 친구들과 재밌게 할 수 있지만,
여전히 불편한 요소들이 많네요.
특히 핵.
핵은 진짜 언제까지 못잡는겁니까
듀오의 경우 랭킹전도 없어서 일반전밖에 뛸 수 없는데, 일반전 뛰면 해커를 하루에 몇판 보는지 아십니까

매번 게임 들어올때마다 xiao**** 뭐시기 며칠밴, 1237****** 영구밴.
이런 팝업 보면서 들어오는게 정상인 게임입니까

유저들이 해커 대신 잡아주는 사람이 아닙니다
직접잡으세요.

===============================================================
첫평가)

이 게임은 구조 자체가 쓰레기인 게임입니다.
게임을 로비로 나가겠다고 하면 무조건 처음 시작하는 로딩 화면을 봐야해요.
패치를 하면 할 수록 또 다른 버그를 만들어내는 대단 업데이트 실력을 보여주며, 핵은 전혀 잡지 않고 방관하는 모습의 답답한 운영도 덤으로 볼 수 있는 게임입니다.
게다가, 중국 지역락을 걸어달라고 전세계적으로 요청해도 들어처먹지 않는 소통능력과, 솔로로 스쿼드를 뛰고 난 다음 다음게임을 할때는 자동으로 솔로로 바뀌어 있어서 또 또 또 솔쿼드로 바꿔줘야하는 매우 답답한 UI까지 갖고있는게임입니다.
제 평생 이런 갓겜은 본 적이 없는 것 같아요 ㅎㅎㅎ
패치 좀 잘 해보세요 제발 부탁드립니다.

The only thing left to buy are the damn ugly skins they let you buy for g-coins. Well played...

So, now that i was dumb enough to pay money for g-coins to be able to get some battle passes, i have actually wasted my money. Thanks for nothing.

Almost seven years and more than a thousand hours in, the game is still weird. I play it because I'm so used to it, but it still has bugs, it still crashes sometimes, general game mechanics have been improved but not smoothed at all. After every update a bug is fixed, and a new one is introduced. The latest update gift gave me 2-second-long frame drops (from the usual 120 fps to 30-40) anytime I walk into any building. Lovely. With the previous season they introduced default Tactical Packs in your inventory that made the game much more interesting, engaging and strategic.. new season, no more Tactical Pack. They made gorgeous maps that are no longer available to play, whereas the OG Erangel map is always available. You could choose what map to play in a few years back, now ya can't anymore. It seems like when players enjoy something too much they take it away from them.

game engine is horrible , anything is slow mode (compare that with apex legends and other online games)
servers are worst servers ever , you hit other people you see their blood after your death you go on their camera and they are on full health , funny thing is after you leave the game the mastery system show you deal more than 100 damage XD
maybe someone say you have network problem , so how my shots are ok in other games ==> Apex Legends , Csgo (horrible game like pubg but weapon shots work) and others shooters game , you hit someone they got damage 
You play on Euro server but its not euro , 90% of players are from other regions (their name is the best prove)
its good game but in hand of bad developers , they are thinking about skins , new map texture and other funny things , they dont do anything about game performance , server issue , game engine and cheaters

after many month download the game again (peoples say its fix , performance , cheaters and ...) but game is still trash like before , full of cheaters , everything in slow motion , you don't know which side the bullets are coming , why the game still alive ? simple answer , cheaters support it

peoples 1 shot you with kar98 or m24 when you are fully cover with smoke !!! :D

after many year back to game and its still full of cheaters :)) trash developers never change

leave the game again and i'm sure 10 years later game is trash as now :))

The game, while now free leading to more cheaters is still quite good in terms of gameplay experience and considering they are actively banning people still I'd say they're doing an okay job. The experience hasn't really changed during the years, something I like since many games nowadays seem to take new directions when playercounts go down. The sniping is still one of the most satisfying in gaming and guns are very balanced with a good variation of going stealthy vs guns in blazing in differing situations.

Vehicles are still a bit bugged but very fun to use and actually a necessity compared to other battle royales since the maps are so big, and stuff like getting hit by a car going 1km/h still deals 90% of your health can be annoying but just makes sure you handle your transportation with care, unless you get run over. As always with these types of games they're much better with friends and while most of the respawn mechanics are borrowed from other games they work great to add more suspense if your team dies early. At the meantime you can bully your opponents through the proximity chat when they're or you're hiding, the voice chat is a quite good feature but it was funnier long time ago when the range was higher and you could talk in the pre-game.

The UI is a bit cluttered when it comes to the main menu combined with the hundreds of sub-menus. While they all have a purpose they could be structured in a different way for a way better experience. But while cluttered the UI does allow for lots of customization for mechanics in-game and for your character in which all parts of your body can be customized independently which I see as better than having full skins where fun combos can't be achieved. This however comes with cost, literally as there now seems to be a battlepass, store and lootcrates but since they aren't that intrusive and you gain stuff regularly no matter what it's not something I hold against the game.

Not unique but balanced and feel good to play once you figure it out and especially fun with mates.",1624878496,1701718379,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

[b]_INTRO[/b]
The game concept is fun. As you can see from my hours played, I do enjoy the core game experience of a battle royale with semi-realistic mechanics. However, the developer is working very hard on ruining the experience by creating 3 classes of customers: the ALMIGHTY STREAMER, who [i]allegedly[/i] can get players banned by his word alone. The FOOL, who pays real money to unlock crates to get clothing items. And finally, the PLEB PLAYER, who is at the butt of the joke.

Before we get into the 3 classes of customers, what is this about? Well, the developer made 3 relevant statements:
[olist]
[*]There will be no microtransactions in EA.
[*]There will be microtransactions for cosmetics only (no guns, no armor, no camo clothes) after EA.
[*]There will [i]probably[/i] be no more free crates after EA.
[/olist]

[b]No. 1[/b] turned out to be a lie as there [strike]are[/strike] were microtransactions in EA with the Gamescom crate and all the clothes are on the Steam marketplace now.

[b]No. 2[/b] is nonsense to me as there are clearly clothing items that are better at camo than others. Visibility is [i]not[/i] just cosmetic in a game like pubg. See video above.

[b]No. 3[/b] means that you won't be able to collect a camo-esque outfit after EA for free. You will be forced to pay money for it. You could also find a camo-esque piece of clothing in a match, but it's pretty obvious that someone who starts with a full camo outfit will be at an advantage over someone who has to be lucky and find all the parts in a match. [i]Additional info: you don't keep the clothes you find in a match. Only clothes from lottery crates are yours to keep.[/i]


[b]_THE CLASS SYSTEM[/b]
Now let's look at the ALMIGHTY STREAMER:
[list]
[*]Streamers get custom servers with their own game modes and settings.
[*]The almighty streamer can claim his death was due to ""stream sniping"" and [i]allegedly[/i] get his killer banned. He simply has to get salty after dying and the devs [i]allegedly[/i] ban the pleb players.
[*]Since the devs included the car horn, it's even better. Players are getting banned, because streamers claim they get harrassed by ""stream honking"". So you use the horn of a car and a streamer feels annoyed, you [i]allegedly[/i] might get banned.
[/list]

Let's look at the FOOL:
[list]
[*]The fool pays for clothes and thinks: it's only cosmetic, it doesn't give an advantage. He thinks that only the ghillie suit gives an advantage. This not true. There is already camo clothing in the game that gives an advantage. The clothing items in Pubg are NOT the same as weapon skins in CSGO.
[*]This crate crap attracts bots to farm ingame currency and gambling sites. I don't like fraudulent shenanigans.
[/list]

Let's look at the PLEB PLAYER:
[list]
[*]Having fun is ok, but if you want first class support you better be a popular streamer.
[*]Having fun is ok, but if you want an advantage, you probably will have to pay for ""purely cosmetic"" items that camouflage you.
[/list]


[b]_CONCLUSION[/b]
You will die or find yourself at a disadvantage caused by a bug, bad performance or lag at least once per play session - but if you play this as a lighthearted romp, the derpy state of the game might actually add to the fun. How the dev can perceive his game as ""e-sports ready"" in this state is a mystery though. Same goes for the microtransactions and streamer drama.

That's why I'd recommend the buggy broken game from a few weeks ago before they added paid crates, but cannot recommend the buggy game that wants to be an e-sport with a p2w lottery crate system.",1502633126,1701629800,False,4678,170,0.823723673820495605,133,True,False,True

Knocked hacker down immediately he make all of us network lag force quit the game when we get back we are dead !

So poor suddenly network lag and keep asking for reconnect unable to go back to the match tried alt-F4 and the match are still in progress but can't get in more worst than before.

The cheater keep make us getting network lag until game crashed at final circle and there was no record on that match too no replay WTF?

Teamkiling is allow in this game cause they don't bother at all. No action taken. Atleast give 24 hours instant ban after team killing in a match.  No instant detection system too for those cheater.

Unstable server ping goes up and down especially FPP match. The new update movement are so disgusting who will run or move like that? Especially when stealth movement. holy crap!

Let us select which map to play on quick match there are some map i dont want to play. Just instantly start quick match doesn't matter if there are player or not. Tired for waiting.

2022- This game getting worst Since after they give FREE TO PLAY, more hacker and toxic player keep team kill like nobody business and mostly are from CHINA. PUBG should block this cheater from their IP address stop create new account to use hack and keep team killing Separate those CHINA player from enter other server.

Too slow on taking action on those cheater and pervert player who intentionally teamkilled teammate.  Why can't pubg just put the anti cheat system to check all player before entering each match.Almost 5 years still cant get it done. 
Anyone who friendly fire from randomly matching teammate get 1 hours ban immediately, own invited teammate who in same group can avoid ban if they accident friendly fire. 

2021-12-  Keep crashing and try to enter back it automatic go to the cancel BUTTON !! make the cancel button smaller!!! 
2021-11-  Keep hear sound like opening the coffin from the halloween, and others strange noisy sound bug.


2021-09 - Stupid game keep close itself on ranked said updating, once get into game I cant swim up and drowned!
2021-7-8： Keep getting network lag after the update。

2021-6-31 : Can't start solo match at all, just start the game with your BOT! Wasting time!
20 minutes can't even start a match.
All the quick join match filled with cheater selling hack, 10 sec before the match start they just  quit whole server become empty ! 

Do not buy any season pass or skin from this game! Not worth!
This game is DEAD ! CHEATER !
Matched with a China cheater in my team told me they used a very stable cheat for a month and did't get ban. WTF?!

2021/5- I keep dropping from the vehicle for no reason My hand not even on the keyboard! Doesn't matter I drive or I just sit on the vehicle!!

2021/4- Bluehole Update SHXX。 SEA Full of Cheater killed more then 30 people in ranked match and bluehole still let Cheater play didn't remove him immediately until he killed everyone in the map and get chicken dinner! Good job blue hole. Ppl selling hack ingame, that's how you earn money bluehole!!??

2021-1 - Why there are gun noise when enter/exit game?  The car sounds so disguising too, keep getting network lag and glitches after update.
-Terrible ranking system, game crashed try to reconnect it just deduct 37 point instantly said I disconnected. WTF!

2020/11/22- what's the point put the chat in the lobby instead of ingame? Why can't we text during in game, voice chat always malfunction cant hear teammate talking.

2020/11/06 -Bad G coin design suppose I just want to view and add coin,didn't notice that it changed the option from ""Add G coin"" into ""Purchase"" accidentally clicked it and purchased the item and cant refund!! Until now support team haven't refund me even they reply email to me asking which item.

2020/10/22 -Season 9: Suddenly lost connection from host while shooting enemy in ranked lost -10 point WTH!

2020/10/13 - Ranked full of hacker! Hacker just shot the sky and kill everyone. Not fair for the score system! Played whole day just Desert map! 

2020/5- The ranked match is worst than the normal match all rude and low class player playing the ranked, new player mouth toxic fighting around in ranked match.They should set standard lvl above 100 only can play in ranked.

2019/10- The new update laggy when I'm inside the house especially when I tried to crouch, the footstep sound very weird too, heard the sound from above but enemy was below.

2019/06-  Always lost connect when middle of the match or on plane and bad design when reconnecting always accidentally click on the cancel button, why they put that cancel button above, most of us rushing to enter back the match! 

2018/11 - After 4 months many interesting feature, graphics quick smooth better than b4 , once enter 1st match killed by HACKER see through everyone! Still can't solve hacker problem.

2018/7-  Why until now you still don't have the ping display on server/ ingame. New update more shutter, Input control & character movement very slow respond, have to wait few second only get in car,not playable especially in squad. 

2018/6- Wow sales!! No don't buy. Stop playing for a month expect their new update will be better ,more worst FPS keep going up and down. Can't connect back after disconnected or crashed, keep connection failed. BUG BUG BUG can't use 1st weapon have to drop it and pick up again. Cusine Royale is FREE now and better than you.

Seriously you call this as leaving early access? Played this game for 700+ hours. 1 Word ""disappointing"". 
1.0 more laggy and worst than the early access. Earn more then $20mil still can't hire a proper programmer to  solve it.",1514336484,1701273259,False,5,1,0.470622479915618896,0,True,False,False

Main gripe I'm writing about is matchmaking. Not times or high ping or that, but when I queue for squads, I'd like to actually play with other people. Out of the last 5 matches I've played casually queued for squads 4 have been solo, which simply isn't fun. I'd like to see an option where IF SOLO > PLACE IN NEW LOBBY, because it's not fun going up against a team of 3 or 4 alone. Even 2 people makes a massive amount of difference.

Now since I play casual I get penalized for quitting those scenarios, or even if my game bugs out. If I'm in JUST THE LOBBY when I quit to re-queue, and my ""social credit score"" is good, why am I being penalized? I want to play with a team, I'm alone, it literally impacts nobody else except me. And now instead of being able to play three games in a night, I can only play two. It's literally the only game that consistently finds ways to eat my quarters and this is just kind of shit.

Other than that, it seems to break every third update or so. It's definitely running better than it did on release, but the optimization will only get you so far. Throw in the lack of map choice, lackluster cosmetics, and everything else that slowly adds up, you get frustrated with it. It's the least stable game in my library, recently (11/28/2023) causing a memory leak when played

Honestly I'd probably play more, and the recent ping system is a bright spot. But the problematic matchmaking and lack of map selection keeps this game frustrating in spite of everything it has going for it.

They are trying to make the game good, but they will never have a good anti cheat system. Ranked is full of cheaters which will ruin your game experience. More annoying are the campers, they should consider adding a anti-camp system like anti camp meter which deals damage if you dont move for a certain time.
To add on top of it, they should make it so we can choose which maps we want to play which are Erangel and Miramar, no one likes maps like Deston,Taego they are disgusting etc, and remove Guillis from Sanhok map cuz people are just camping in bushes and waiting to ruin someones game.
Also fix the car physics please!

It's a mixture of dislikes and likes.
Obviously could be better but PUBG is a mix feeling when it comes to updates and rewards.
It's heavy on the CPU than GPU.
I'll give this game a positive review because I still play thousands of hours into it.

Plus it's free-to-play now so it's no cost to you even though we paid ever since release.

[code]
2nd Updated preview (NEGATIVE): After so many updates and playing this game, I cannot recommend it. This game is so unbalanced, a SMG is better than a M416. A pistol is now better than a shotgun if used right. Vehicles are outdated and it's better to use the newer vehicles. Maps are great until they started removing buildings and landscapes over time. Messing around with loot patterns that doesn't even make sense to me. This game was supposed to be better in physics and combat! Movement is so clunky that you're better off wearing a straight jacket. Just in one month, I have banned over 15 cheaters. As soon as we think that they're improving with their anti-cheat engine, it doesn't matter because they've already ruined your game and apparently have many accounts to play on.
Only reasons why I play this game is:
1) Friends
2) Loot crates that I sell for a few pennies, every week.
-
Pros: Decent Multiplayer game with friends
Cons: After playing about a few hundred hours, you'll get tired of the restrictions of the game.
R6S is better even though it's not a battle royale.

Previous review (NEGATIVE):
I'm not recommending this game. I'm not recommending someone to buy a $30 dollar game that doesn't work on a gaming pc. The lags, the bugs. I bought this game for 2 people and the 3rd instantly asked me to refund it. The rest complains how bad this game is. No, I will not recommend this game to anybody because I don't want them to be fustrated when they've shot a guy with the exact same gun, but some how the guy turns around and kills you because the hitbox was not registering. I will not recommend this game until somehow you guys stop doing microtransaction, and actually fix the game to the point it is playable. I enjoy this game, but I had to spend over 8 hours fixing it. Putting Reshader on, finding out which settings run better, and manage to squeeze every frame per second I can get-- which is funny, because I shouldn't have that problem on a GTX 970. 
I'm not recommending this game, because I had more enjoyment playing Fortnite and that game is free to play.
However, I will recommend this game someday- if it ever does fix the optimization. If it ever does fix the hitboxes. If it ever does fix the motorcycle problem. If it ever does fix the blurriness of the landscape and gun sights. If it ever does fix the horrible parachuting frozen glitch. If it ever does fix the random car exploding when it clips into a chair. If it ever does fix...
Who am I kidding. Probably why they put it on early access and just managed to put 'twitch items' and 'marketplace clothes' for more popularity- thus getting more money. I don't think they're ever going to fix the game. They're just adding to it, and dissing everyone because twitch users are basically bringing them their paycheck.
Please avoid this game until then, or buy it when it on special. Please.[/code]",1507525085,1701073976,True,0,0,0.523891150951385498,0,True,False,False

Last year since i watched so many streamers play it, I decided to give it another chance so i bought the game! It was still very buggy, very glitchy but it came a long way and it was playable. 

Now after some hours spent in this game i can definetly say it is still a bad game, the developers refuse to fix it, they just add new content, after every update there are 10 more buggs, the game runs worse than it did the last patch. This happens every time when an update comes out.

Now let's talk about the playstyle. You land, you try to find weapons but you can't because the guns did not SPAWN yet! WTF is that sh*t? After running like a headless chicken looking for guns for like 4-5 seconds, they finally appear and you will loot for like 5-10 minutes depending where the circle is. If the circle is in the oposite side of the map, you WILL NOT find a vehicle to get to the circle, and IF you do, you'll probably die to the RED ZONE wich is the most re*a*ded thing ever invented!

I do NOT recommend buying this game.

But at the beginning of 2023 I gave the game a new chance as some friends asked me to join in and I was baffled how much has changed. Now I had really fun playing the game and about 90% or more of my total playtime I made this year. I really like this game. No, it is not dead and yes, it has some cheaters, but all in all they are not that crowded, at least what I have experienced so far.

Pros:
- a lot of customisation options for your character
- a lot of customisation options for your weapons
- ingame events for new skins
- a good variety of weapons
- devs keep up to improve the game
- fun to play with friends
- no pay2win as it is now free to play

and you have to start a game over and over again, it's frustrating, but it's not the big Issue - 
Ping adventage ruining alot of opportunities, 1 player shoot on another player at the same time - the one with the lowest ping going to get the kill and the other one dies without connecting any shot,
all the items you get now from Ingame is ""Not tradable"", you cannot sell it in steam, you cannot trade them, that is just bound to your account and you basically cannot do anything about that but ""Adding money"" to make some upgrades to the weapon or just Puting alot of hours to get some scraps.
We cannot talk to each other for the first 1 minute, There is no ""China number 1"" or ""I'm a Snake Follow me"" anymore.
There are still alot of bugs and Lower fps for those with ""High end PCs""

This game was promised as the future of online gaming, but in reality it is a complete failure. It constantly slows down and lags, which makes the gameplay not only slow but also terribly annoying. In addition, the game's graphics look outdated and are not up to modern standards. 

Also, I don't like the way PUBG developers treat their players. They don't listen to feedback and don't improve the game according to user requests. Instead, they release new updates with bugs and errors that only make the gameplay worse.

Overall, PUBG is a game that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not only is it not enjoyable, but it is a complete waste of time and money. If you want to play a good online game, you better choose something else.",1700908355,1700908355,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Content:
Pubg has essentially 3 game modes: solo, duo and squads(up to 4 players) that can all be playied in first person only or in third person. 
At the moment of writing this, the game is centered around 5/6 ""active"" maps (there is a sort of rotation system in which some maps are taken out for some time , usually a month or two, slightly changed and tweaked, to then be reput in the game) which are quite different both in location and in gameplay. 
For istance there are smallers maps, like Karakin, which offer only 64 players mode and high pace run and gun gameplay. On the other hand there are the classical big maps like Erengel and Miramar, centered around a more slow style of play with 100 players gamemodes.
With regard to the variety of weapon, altough the game was a bit lackluster in that area in its early days, nowadays, after 5 years of countless updates the game has reached a very respactable level in my opinion, as there are many weapons which caters towards different style of play and it will take a long time for a new player to master them all. 
Moreover the games offers a deathmatch mode, which, i must say, its not very tought out as the maps are simply very small parts of the standard BR maps chosen without any apparent logic behind it. Furthermore deathmatch mode is full of max level players who will destroy even experienced players so i would not suggest it to beginners as im sure they would have a very rough time.

Gunplay: 
being a tps/fps battle royale the gunplay is obviuosly one of the most important aspect of the game. At first, especially if you don't have an fps background, it could be very hard to use many weapons properly and effectively, as most of them have lots of recoil(especially ARs, SMGs and LMGs). One of the key there is to understand the attachment system by trying different loadouts in the training mode to learn how to use every weapon effectively. 
Tip: as a beginner try to avoid weapons like the beryl or most LMGs , for example, since they are very hard to master even for experienced players; stick instead to more ""noob friendly"" weapons like the M416. SCAR-L and M16.

Looting:
looting is a core aspect of the game (as it is in all BRs), given that in every single game you will need to find weapons, armor, attachments, medic kits, bandages and much more scattered around the map. At first it will be very hard to understand how to loot faster and not standing in the middle of a street looting a dead body just to get kill from a sniper hundreds of metres away from you. Onother important thing when looting is, of course items prioritization and inventory management which are key to succed in this game (there are some good guides on youtube about it). All in all i would say the best way to learn how to loot fast and effectively is just to play the game as in my case required some hours just to get the gist of it XD.

Bots:
This is quite a controversial topic as bots were not in the game at launch but were introduced a couple of years down the line. The main motive behind it i think was in part to help newer players by essentially giving them free kills and loot, but also to fill servers (most importantly in areas with very few active players). At first it seems quite minor change but nowadays at least 30% of players in duo and squads matches are bots (at least in my matches anyway XD) and sometimes it really feels like it's all bot. Moreover the bot AI is quite annoying actually as they often stand in open areas shooting each other and other players for minutes  producing lots of noise; the majority are killed by the blue zone; most of the time they stand around some form of cover (like a tree or a rock) moving like mad left and right around it. All this makes them very distracting and annoying and i would strongly suggest to either entirely remove them or toning down their use.

Framerate/Optimization:
Altough in its first years the game was in a very rough state (it is ,after all, a very heavy game) as its fps were very inconsistent and the game was poorly optimized, in its current state it offers a very smooth experienced and can also be playied on medium to low level systems fairly easily. For istance i play with 1060 6gb, i5 7600k, 8gb of ram and to this day the game runs quite smoothly above 100 fps on medium to high settings.

Conclusion:
Pubg is still in 2022 a very good battle royale game and i think for the BR/fps players is a must have also for its contribution to the genre being a true pioneer. Also now its free so you don't have any excuses XD. Finally i would suggest to try it with friends as in my opinion is the best way to have fun while cooperating to get that juicy chicken dinner XD.

I hope this review is helpful, much love, bye ;).

Later update: the game has seen a lot of changes regarding gameplay/server stability and the 1.0 version is close and seems even more promising.

+ Solid Battle Royale gameplay. You get dropped out of the plane and you need to loot places, get into fights and take down the enemy 
+ Very High Replayability
+ You can have great fun with your friends
+ You can switch between First Person and Third Person mode in the lobby
+ When you play the game you can earn points and with these points you can buy stuff in the game and sell them on the community market (Outfits, Crates)
+ You can drive cars in the game (Jeep, Buggy, Bike, and the Dacia)
+ You can make your own outfit with cosmetics or choose to get a cool outfit with the squad
+ The new map Sanhok with increased loot is awesome
+ Decent graphics

- Lots of bugs (Random crashes, Vehicle getting stuck in a fence and you explode, Getting stuck in objects, Teleporting under the map and get the game win)
- Lots of cheaters (Flying cars, Aimbotters, speed hackers)
- Only 3 maps to play (Erangel, Miramar and Sanhok)
- Poor optimization
- When aiming at someone close standing behind objects can cause that the bullets connect in the wall, so you don't actually shoot the enemy but they can just kill you without you hitting them
- Bad sound

Bluehole doesnt ban cheaters, and they ban legitimate players for pulling off amazing feats. 

They subjectivly ban/unban people as they see fit, they dont care about their game. They update frequently but change the wrong things that hurt the game more than it helps. 

In my opinion the game never left early access.

Don't buy this game, it will just be a big waste of time and money.

Loot boxes that only contain mediocre cosmetics, and cost more than a CSGO crate.

Yes i know there are bugs and people cheat and it sucks when you get killed but having said that patches are always coming out and issues are being resolved. every game has its issues and i like this game so much because they continue to address issues little by little. the game has changed in so many ways since the beta and the initial early access release. this isnt a game that is staying in early access forever or never gets any work done to it. it certainly can become monotonous playing the same game on the same map over and over again, but it hasnt stopped me. if you are on the fence for this game atleast grab it before it hits full release soon. return it if you dont like it.

[h1]Choose Your Own Adventure Battle Royale[/h1]

I’ve been playing this since almost the very beginning. It has evolved so much over the last few years. There have been lots of ups and downs. I’ve met tons of people through this game and even have built a small community.

[list]
[*]Arguably the best shooting mechanics around.
[*]Went from basic movement to now having vaulting and ledge grabbing. These don’t necessarily always work the way you intend.
[*]The game can run badly so it is common to reduce the fancy looks for smoother game play.
[*]Audio sounds great but has had serious bugs.
[*]Best battle royale but the ups and downs have scared many away, rightfully so.
[*]There are hackers, cheaters, etc.
[*]Most maps out of any of the battle royales.
[*]There is little to no story for this game. They are trying to add some story elements in. However, the choose your own adventure style of the game has the ability to create memorable moments nearly every game (assuming you don’t jump school every game.)
[*]Queue times can be an issue depending on region.
[/list]

This game is hard for me to review because I’ve seen so much change over the years. Some that watch it may say it looks janky but with so much time played it doesn’t feel that way to me. When this game works it's the best game around.

11/23/2023 Update

PUBG has grown significantly since I originally wrote this review. I stand by the style of battle royale that it is. There are still adding maps, added clans, updated comeback mechanics, added guns, and just generally trying new things out. It still tries to stick to the old formula while trying to bring in some of the expected gameplay mechanics that you see in other BR games. The learning curve is brutal, the devs have plenty to work on, and things to figure out. I still highly recommend this as the best BR around. It's free now a days, give it a try.

Genuinely from a hardcore pubg fan - don't play it's not fun

An insanely big map for you to never see people in, lackluster ballistics, literally just a battle royale.

If you're interested in PUBG - Highly recommend:
Escape from Tarkov - Imagine PUBG but remove the terrible maps, add horror and better everything (It's 40 bones tho)
COD Warzone - Realistic type gameplay but much better gunplay, fights, and scale
Apex Legends - Similar to Warzone except very sci-fi/cyberpunk aesthetics and hero abilities
Fortnite - If you just want A battle royale that'll keep things updated

I originally came from the Battle Royale Mod that PlayerUnknown made for Arma 3, and as soon as I saw that he had began developing his own standalone game I knew I needed to get it. I waited a while to write this review because I wanted to soak alot before I expressed my opinion. I'm going to start by saying that PUBG without a doubt has some problems. Some of these include the occasional server lag and the chinese takeover of the NA servers. This I feel will be getting fixed in the long run seeing that the devs are very enthusiastic about their game. Now some people say its stupid that you can get banned from stream sniping/ team killing, this is their way of trying to fix trolls and people that ruin the experience. There are ways they can change that and better ways to prevent the cheaters but the game hasnt been out for a year yet. The devs are trying and will find a way to fix these problems. The game also has a great deal of good things. This includes but is not limited to monthly updates and weekly patches. The monthly updates always add new items or aspects into the game, some are small and some are big. They are also working on more maps to try to prevent the game getting boring and repetitive. Another pro is that the game is realistic but not too realistic, there are realistic aspects but they arent too hardcore. Some examples could be bullet ballistics, muzzle flashes, bullet types, and grenades, some things that prevent it from being too hardcore is there is no bleeding unlike H1Z1's bleeding mechanic. This game is a very fun and chill game to play with your friends or by yourself, I highly recommend it.

Matchmaking is poor. When I'm trying to play in squads with a random team sometimes I can't get even 1 teammate so I need to leave and start again to have another 3 teammates for the game in squads. Also sometimes there are toxic players, who are trying to kill me or other teammates without any reason. Plus a lot of China players buying accounts even after bans and keep playing on EU servers and destroying are any fun in this game...All of these problems without a solution by devs all over years...
I can say, they fix freezes and bugs, but not matchmaking and there is no enjoyable game as it is can be!
You can ask, why are you playing this game then? I will answer you because I like the physics and the movements in this game and the whole concept, it's better than Tarkov or DayZ for me, so I'm here only because of this and the chance to get in the squads with good teammates, then this game is enjoyable for me. Waiting for the moment when they fix matchmaking...It will be much better!
So I can't really recommend it to play if you are a newbie. I suggest you find another game where devs pay attention not to the mobile version of the game, but to the PC version as well!
You can try Dayz, Tarkov, or maybe something less popular! Dayz is good for newbies because of community PVE servers, try them!

This is the highest amount of fun i had for 30$ i spent on anything in life, game is better played in Duo/Squad because some solo tend to be lonely and a bit boring when you don't have any action for 20 minutes.

For all the new players, this isn't an easy game, if you think you can win and master this game after 20 hours please don't bother buying it and start nagging in the reviews/forums/reddit, you need a huge amount of playtime and patience to become decent and learn the mechanics

Devs need to focus more on what is important to move this game to another level, especially if they want it to become an eSport game, which i don't see happening at the same scale they had in mind and not just because of the bugs in the game but the actual luck involved in each match (random weapons, armor, circle).

Update
Just spent the night playing v1.0 which was released today and game is better than ever many issues fixed and many cheaters banned. For 30 bucks this game is a steak.

Update on the survivor pass I was against paying for a pass for some skins and extra challenges but I found the challenges increased the depth of the game and are worth 10 buck for the three months

The (IMHO) best BR game out there right now, by the daddy of the genre. Fear, frustration, challenge, and elation will all be yours as you roam the landscape of Erangel alone or with (hopefully) friends to battle for supremacy.

Sure the game has flaws, but it's still in early access, and it's still being actively worked on. Time will tell if this game wrinkles out it's issues and reaches the full potential it certainly has.

2018-11-26: Game is still fun, still buggy. Has improved in many ways over the last year, but is still marred by the (apparent) incompetence of it's developers in fixing long-time bugs and optimizing the game and servers.

2019-11-27: One year later... many improvements in QOL and gameplay, and arguably a few regressions. Servers are better on the whole, but still flaky sometimes. The loss of map selection in certain regions (NA!) is frustrating. Skins are still overpriced. Core gameplay is still great, devs are still pretty crappy. Less blatant hackers, at least in NA.

2021-11-24: It's still pretty fun but player count has tanked. YMMV.

---------------------------------------------------------------

2020 Update
------------------
The game sthil worth, butttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt...
They add some dumb BOTS with excuse that they want to make the game more easy for new comers, but what is actually happening is that experienced players are getting worse because they think every player is a bot, and the new comers are not learning properly because the behavior of the bot dont reflect the behavior of the real enemys.

So... If you are not interesting in a super immersive battle royale experience like the game used to provide, i trully reccomend.

By the way, you can play only with real players if you want but it needs to be in a ranked mode, only squads and only in some selected especific maps.

Im just sad because this game used to provide a big freedom and immersive realistic experience, and now they just making this game looks like every other BR game.

PLAYERUNKNOWN (Brendan Greene) got a offer from Sony to make a standalone Battle Royale game and he just accepted it. H1Z1 came out shortly but he wasn't happy with the game. After a short time of disappointment he just left H1Z1 and started the work on PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.

Now he got the ""control"" about his game. He can decide everything. That's how it started!

About the game:

It offers some huge (and some small) maps, many weapons and vehicles and so much fun.
Some users don't like some changes and things but you can't make everyone happy about a game.

A quick disclaimer....the game is in early release so you should not expect a complete game. The premise of the game is you start in a airplane flying over an open world sandbox with the goal of being the last person standing out of 96-99 people (depending on game mode). You jump out of the plane and have to gather gear, health, and weapons to fight with in the game. As time progresses there is a zone that grows smaller and smaller forcing people closer together. If you're caught outside of the zone it will kill you. You can play in squads (4 player teams), Duo's (2 player teams), or Solo's with it being you verses 99 enemy's. If you manage to survive  to the end you get the win, which the game calls a chicken dinner. This game will give you a massive adrenoline rush and is tremendously fun. I personally have had 3-4 wins where I didn't have to fire a shot with the enemy dying outside the zone. New content is expected to be released shortly and the designers are trying to finish/polish the game to have it fully released by the end of the year.

Still negative review!

Play this game with friends or solo - fed up of having to team up with chinese players who do not speak english.
The game is fun but fix their god damn Asian servers!!!!! They will keep on flooding EU/US servers, making the server lag and destroying the overall experience.

Do I recommend the game? Yes. It's a great game but not under these conditions.
Read all other negative reviews, same stuff.

Blueballs, you made millions already, fix the Asian servers and all of us enjoy the game.

This week i got 2 bans for 24h for investigation without even playing this game. In december 2019 i got permanent ban without a reason, spent 10 days moving around forums/community to find an unban.
Still not recomending.

Dont buy this game. Its unfair and made by lazy developer.

Introduce a new map? they remove the previous. Exploring the new map is super fun with loot and action right? then they immediately nerf it to make you stuck inside a mediocre-looting spiral, dying from flying people with no recoil.
Moreover, this game gives you no satisfaction rewards, compared to like other games, where even without buying the battle pass you get awesome weapons skins easily, here you get strange coupons to spend and buy other coupons to get access to mediocre cosmetics that dissolve over time.

The microtransactions got even worse but the game got countless updates and seems like in a good spot.

=====================


UPDATE JULY 2018:

The initial great reviews of this game was mostly because the community thought developers are different to DayZ or H1Z1. The reality is that developers turned PUBG into a cash cow that needs to be milked before it dies. Instead of fixing the game they focus on adding countless DLCs while the game is almost unplayable because of lags/desyncs. We was scammed.


=====================


If you are not a big Twitch streamer or a YouTuber, don't buy this game. You will be treated like a s&*t by the developers/admins. I will review this game again after few months.

Pros:
- unique playstyle
- most adrenaline I got out of any game ever
- funny moments with random people (voice chat included)
- relatively frequent patches

Cons:
- slightly repetitive after while
- bugs, lags, not much content (yes, it's EA)
- admins banning people without evidence
- developers broke promise of finishing the game before microtransactions",1501327432,1700615870,True,0,0,0.505434811115264893,0,True,False,True

Solid server quality, problem with long distance players still exist, where you shoot them they dont die.
Fun game to play, with small problem if you play in 2-3-4 squads you will be killed mostly by team up players who play against randoms.
Game was way better when it was pay to play, free to play system increase amount of cheaters tripple time.

UPDATE NOV 2023: This is a BR game you can never really quit. I always come back to it. Even on mobile version. Now, if you're wondering about hackers, I'm sure there are some but personally I haven't really run into it. Not at least the blatantly hackers. Though some deaths were questionable, hackers aren't really problematic in BR settings. Maybe in arcade mode such as team death match where the sometimes enemies seems like they know where you are and they seem to shoot a lot more accurately than you do. But then all of that DO get thrown out of window because with enough practice you can control your recoil of the gun and track your enemies via noises.

Pros: 
Nice graphics
One punch man
The pan.Every time when you find a pan you can already say GG. That shit is op as fuck. 
Don't forget the great physics. You can drive a motorbike, dive in a river but literally you can jump with the bike on the water. After that you bounce in a tree and explode. Or you can land with a car on houses. Or you can go through windows and walls.  And many others. 
This game is fun as hell. You can play with a team while solo when you are fighting for a car and decide to win together. 

Cons: 
Cheaters
A lot of bugs and glitches. 
Many crashes
Trolls
The fucking red zone that hits you in the middle of nowhere when you are full level 3.
Asian pricks

Old Review Dec 2017:

Graphics (2017): 5/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Sound: 9/10
Customization: 7/10
Weapon Variety: 6.5/10
Performance (GTX 1080): 85-115 fps @ULTRA 1080p
Fun: 10/10

The game succeeds in creating a tense environment and forces the player to constantly keep on moving. Its an excellent concept with and even better execution. Some things could be better such as the graphics. They look pretty dated for a game in 2017 but graphics are not everything and where the game is good, its really good. The gameplay is solid but the jumping mechanics could be worked on a bit more. The sound is really detailed and even the smallest of mistake can give away your location to those in your vicinity. Every experience is different from the previous; sometimes you may get lucky and find a gold mine of weapons, armors and ammo but other times you will fail to find even a frying pan. Speaking of frying pans, the attention to detail is spot on. If not equiped, the frying pan will deflect bullets shot at it and protect your back. HOW COOL IS THAT!

Update 1: Only 24 hours left until this game escapes early access. So proud of the devs who are working hard on this game and have made this game the face of PC Gaming! YOU ROCK!",1499330817,1700373447,False,0,0,0.564624488353729248,0,True,False,True

I think the game died out when the devs couldn't fix all the bugs fast enough, plus they didn't add any new content - so naturally the game got stale and dried up

With games like Warzone and Fortnite it's a hard market to try and make a comeback in popularity. I really wish I played during it's prime when Shroud and chocoTaco videos were getting millions of views consistently.

I'm glad it went free to play, considering the competition it would be dumb not to. I hope one day it gets into the spotlight again.

I still play the shit out of this game as its the only good BR out there, so if you want a game with good gun mechanics, 2 good maps (out of the 5/6 they have) then PUBG can still do it for you.

EDIT JULY 2022:

Game still crashes heavily for people, they still have terrible map queues, released a new map with little to no marketing and introduced new bugs because of lack of QA testing, lack of loot on new map is a funny way of them showing they still have no idea what they're doing 5 years in.

Don't bother buying it unless you're going to play with friends, otherwise its a bad game.

EDIT NOVEMBER 2023:
Krafton still lack the ability to run good servers, enjoy having spikes of 200-300 ping for no reason at all and out of your control.

Also, enjoy suffering through their terrible map selection process having to leave their terribly designed maps (Sanhok, Vikendi, Deston, Paramo, Karakin) and new terrible functions like the sandstorm and blizzard.

The gun play is absolutely unmatched, the driving is decent and it works at intended. There are many games out there that are more well suited for other people or younger audiences such as Fortnite and Apex but the do not satisfy like pubg does. There is a lot to love with pubg with the randomness and how each match is different than the last. No gunfight will be the same and it is actually challenging to get a win and it feels very well worth it when you do get one. I can play PUBG all day and granted there are many things that i do not like about the game or maybe the developers themselves but its obviously not enough to keep me away form my favorite game.....

........ NOW FOR THE BAD......

Pubg used to cost money.... its now free to play and that was very detrimental to the game and the player base. with a free game comes what.... cheaters... new accounts....cheaters...and new accounts. how can you possibly keep someone from cheating in this game if you ban their account and they can simply just make another free account??? there are cheaters and you will encounter them i wouldn't say everyday but you will and it is very frustrating. every game has cheaters and banning them will always be a battle so cant be to hard on the devs for THAT but its still a problem note worthy.
With pubg being a free game what else comes with that? well exploiting people for over priced skins and very low customization options unless they are behind an extensive paywall. you don't get to purchase the skins you want they make you use g-coin you have to purchase with real money to buy crates that have a 1 percent chance to get one of the three rare weapon skins in that season...okay lets say you get the weapon out of a crate.. sure, i have before okay well in order to upgrade your progressive skin you just got it cost blueprints which have a less that one percent chance to get out of a crate and you need polymers from scraping other skins. i have over 2000 hours in pubg and i tell you what i have NEVER got a blueprint out of a crate. not only do you need that you need at least 3 for the first skin upgrade and that's just to chance the scope skin to match the gun.... just ridiculous money grab and its a huge slap in the face to all the loyal pubg players out there who love the game but feel they are treated like crap by the devs and exploited for more money.

Other than stated there isn't much i dislike about pubg, i love the game the mechanics and almost everything about it but the cheaters and money grab is something that will forever hold me back from being 100 percent loyal to pubg and bluehole devs. if you want a game though to casually play with friends or alone and want to be competitive then give PUBG a shot. If i'm not playing Escape from Tarkov which i have 3000 hours in then im playing PUBG.

I turned off voice coms permanently because it is so bad. Buying this game for your kid? If you want him to turn into a little jerk with a bad attitude and the vocabulary of a drunken sailor? Get him a headset and this game and abandon him to PUBG for a week or so... This game is so bad it should be free... seriously this game needs to just give up on itself.

Update 2023 - The game is worse now than it was in 2019 when I wrote this review... and guess what? NOW ITS F2P LOL... guess PubG read my review. If you want a comparison to how bad this game is now... OG Black Ops 2.... Need I say more? This game is so toxic it will have you breaking your desk... Hackers rule this game and they say they are having competitions? What a joke. This game needs to frag itself.

UNINSTALLED - I thought Warzone and FN were bad. This company is so bad at fighting off hackers that they should just give it to the community as shareware. I haven't seen such a barrage of entirely blatant hacking in ONE GAME of PubG in my entire experience gaming (other than COD Black Ops 2 of course that game is destroyed) From aimbot to esp to homebrewed hacks like lag switching and ddos server side stuff...

Not much have changed..
Cheaters are banned left and right but since the game is free.
Uninstall and reinstall new name and theyre back..
Untill they ban the the users PC parts nothing will change.

(no recoils, aimbots, wall hacks, health cheat)
You can report, but little to no resolve from THIS COMPANY.
If the cheaters are ""PAYING"" customers cheating are OK.
Itrs rampant..   even now on the asian servers.
its a dead game now...

And yet another ""great twitcher"" SHROUD have been caught cheating and got baned 30 days!  only 30 days.
He should have been permabaned from PUBG, Twitch, steam online games etc.

Why you ask?  they ruin the online game for all others.

Update:

Shroud was back online after 3 days with new account called BadShroud.
And yes ....    Why even remove the cheater when he buys another copy!
Bluehole really need to change their name to Brownhole!

Want to see everybody ingame, want auto aim ??   (change youre minimap into a ingame radar with where the circles are drop boxes and even more)
Source code for radar and aimbot cheats are located on pubg ESP GITHUB.
And NOTHING is done to stop the cheats!!


Update:

This game still suffers from a massive cheating.

Aim bots / auto shooter / casual 
Wallhacks 
No recoil scripts with 10-100% effect
no shaking when exhausted 
faster runing / Parachuting
where are the GOOD loot pointers
Audio DLL hooks to avoid the PB anti cheat. (buggy sound engine)
no grass, bushes, trees, shadowy houses and more
extra perspective.
no death cam footage


Another update:

Its still a joke..

Cheating is just the same just now its absolutly totally rampant..

Why cant i return this crap ?

update.
HWID spoofing are awailable...    cheaters are unbanable now..
1 in 10 players DONT use a no recoil scripts.

2-12 players per match rest are bots.. 
Hard to find more players nowadays..

going from top 10 players in 5 of 10 games winning 1-3 games per 10 games to now maybe able to kill 1 players before im insta fragged by ANY gun with 2-3 shoots from any kinds of distance.  

ahh yes lets not forget the bullet cheat that allows you to shoot more bullits per bang.
Game sees 2-3 bullits fired when infact a bullit is 5-10 rounds in one.

another Update:

All the old cheats are still there including now weapon and item spawning...
They say! they ban 100k a week,   Just lies.
They just make new steam accounts and download the game again since its free.

MDM5 Hash their PC and then BAN that HASH from STEAM and the others (EA, ORIGIN, GOG, EPIC, BLIZZARD) due to a joint anti cheat venture WHERE all game outlets swap MDM5 hashes for bans.

Then the cheaters would need to buy a rig aswell as a new steam account each time they get caught.

Aslong as they dont make a MDM5 hash of the cheaters computers and ban those machines instead of a account they will NEVER get rid of the cheats online.
 
Spend youre TIME and CASH on SINGLE PLAYER games where there are NO cheaters.
Online games are all pointless due to the amount of cheaters in them.",1531615501,1699764237,False,2,1,0.498278260231018066,0,True,False,False

Pug Squads have been invaded by retarded Chinese folks who's idea of a good time is dying in the first minute after drop.
Chinese have flooded the NA channels and do not want to play as a ""team"" plus noone can communicate.
Many pug squadders have no mics. 
Some of the snipers are a bit too strong imo.
Last couple circles you become a dirt and grass farmer. Not very fun but it gets chicken dinners so were stuck with it.

End of the day a bunch of hilarious and awesome youtube content has been created with PUBG. It's a fun game with a decent community. Lots of good memories in matches thus far!

Side Note: If you are reading this please pass this on and adhere to it. If you are playing public pug squad don't be a potato no mic using jerk-off. Try and play as a team make some friends some folks will insta add you if you play well. 

To the DEVS: Put in an option that sends a duel request out if in a final 5 or 3 situation. If accepted by all everyone loses everything but gains a frying pan and chicken dinner goes to the last one standing with the frying pan! That would make the final minute or two so much more special!

UPDATE:2021 Played the game again and honestly compared to Ring of Elysium it's hot garbage. I loved PUBG, had tons of fun with it right up until Brenden Greene started calling people like me Xenophobes for wanting region locks to deal with Chinese hackers. Then the facts were put out there that in FACT 90% of all the hacks and hackers were in or originated from CHINA. So for that reason alone I down vote the game. Besides Ring of Elysium is superior in about every way, better graphics, better gunplay, smother actions and movement, better pick up system so you can focus on playing the game and not the pick S%%t up fast mini game.

Update 2023: Ring of Elysium was a batter game overall hands down. Shroud's a tool for saying otherwise and pancaking the game. Hard to get into the game now too much sus and sweat.

Reviewer: Raiyan0628

Tactical Gameplay: PUBG demands a level of tactical awareness rarely seen in gaming. Players must constantly adapt to the ever-shrinking safe zone, forcing engagements that require strategic thinking and quick decision-making.

Team Coordination: Communication and teamwork are paramount. Effective coordination with your squad can be the difference between victory and defeat. This mirrors the critical importance of teamwork in real-world military operations.
Realistic Weaponry: The arsenal in PUBG is meticulously crafted, mirroring real-world firearms. Understanding the ballistics and recoil patterns adds a layer of authenticity to the gameplay.

Pros:
Realism and Immersion: PUBG excels in creating an immersive battlefield experience. The realistic environments, coupled with authentic sound design, make every firefight feel visceral and intense.
Continuous Development: The development team consistently updates the game, introducing new maps, weapons, and gameplay mechanics. This commitment to improvement keeps the experience fresh and engaging.
Diverse Map Selection: From the dense forests of Erangel to the desert expanses of Miramar, each map offers a unique and dynamic battleground, ensuring no two matches feel the same.
Global Player Base: With millions of players worldwide, PUBG offers a vibrant and competitive community. Whether you're a casual gamer or aspiring esports pro, there's a place for you in this expansive player base.
Customization and Cosmetics: The game provides an extensive array of customization options, allowing players to personalize their characters and weapons, adding a touch of individuality to the battlefield.

Cons:

Learning Curve: PUBG has a steep learning curve, especially for newcomers. Mastering the mechanics and map knowledge takes time and patience.
Optimization: While PUBG has made significant strides in optimization, it can still be demanding on hardware. Players with lower-end systems may experience performance issues.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on Steam stands as a testament to the potential of the battle royale genre. Its emphasis on realism, tactical gameplay, and team coordination creates an experience that resonates with military analysts like myself. With a thriving player base and continuous development, PUBG remains a powerhouse in the gaming world.",1698550220,1698550220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I came from the DayZ mod, where gameplay was slow and careful, weapons and resources were extremely rare, and you could lose everything very quickly by getting too close to a group of zombies or encountering an unfriendly player.

PUBG was a completely different kettle of fish, where some of the elements of DayZ had been distilled into shorter play sessions, where the action was frenetic and somewhat stressful.  Picking your jump point from the plane, the descent to your chosen area and the initial desperate search for weapons and supplies, were all elements that injected something new.  

The weapons were realistic and had various attachments that would enhance them, so you were always on the lookout for something to improve what you already had.  The blue electrical field that kept moving in, decreasing the safe space on the island, was great at forcing players out of places where they were hiding.  I remember the stress of hiding inside a building, hearing someone outside come in and start to search the property, knowing that there was possibly someone inside.",1698506212,1698506212,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

• [u]Cheating and Hacking Concerns[/u]: The prevalence of cheaters and hackers disrupts the integrity of matches, diminishing the satisfaction of legitimate victories.

• [u]Server Instabilities[/u]: PUBG has, at times, struggled with server stability issues, resulting in lag, disconnections, and other online connectivity problems.

• [u]Microtransaction Impact[/u]: While optional, the influence of microtransactions on cosmetic items and skins can sometimes overshadow the core gameplay experience, necessitating a balance between revenue generation and maintaining the integrity of the gaming environment.

The shit they made of quick matchmaking made me crazy. 9 of 10 games you either end up with cheaters gangbanging your mouth, or having 400-500lvl players doing exactly the same while you are being lvl 50. So how am i supposed to lvl up, devs? You've made rankeds (where i can  hang out with same stupid bronzes as i am) literally unavailable for new or coming back player tho didnt do anything to make unrankeds playbale for them? Sure, you give no shit. How is that game has better reviews than overwatch 2? I play ow 2 as well, its the disaster as well in many terms including balance and monetisation but man, its at least playable and joyable. But this ""game"" is just so goddamn ruined.

Turns out they reset the game, so I had to do the tutorial(no big deal), but in order to play ranked games I have to play atleast 10 casual mode games, and they limit you to 3 casual mode games a day against bots. I dont have the will or the want to wait 4 days to be able to play a ranked mode in a game I purchased, when I last played ranked wasnt locked behind a time gate.

However, I recently noticed a minor yet noticeable inconsistency in the naming convention of PLAYERUNKNOWN's items which I believe warrants attention.

While going through the inventory, I noticed that the 'S' in PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Trench Coat is capitalized, while the 's' in PLAYERUNKNOWN's Bandana is in lowercase. This inconsistency in capitalization might seem trivial, but it can potentially lead to confusion, especially for new players or when discussing these items in community forums. Moreover, it affects the overall polish of the game, reflecting a lack of attention to detail which is uncharacteristic for a game of this caliber.

Consistency in naming conventions is crucial for maintaining a seamless and professional gaming experience.

BIG F TO YOU.

What makes me thumbs down:
-MOBILE VERSION. If I knew mobile version is coming, I'd rather play Mobile one and not spend any money on this game that has been launched. Not even proud of myself bought this game.
-Two big challenges for me: shooting has bullet drop, that with JUST A BIT of lag, and you'll miss most of the shots. That gives me really a frustrating challenge, that is not related/part of the game (the lag)
-Playing this game is giving me stress instead of fun after tiring day of working. Looting and carefully shooting enemies until the last 10 person, suddenly someone one shotted you from afar or out of nowhere, or after intense battle and you failed. Add that with connection issue/lagging and you're in great mix for adding your own stress level. Of course, I dont really blame the game for this.
-The recoil and bulletdrop are hell. The need to tweak this a lot. 
-Cosmetics charge a damn lot. Fk that.

Why previously I thumbed up:
-Freedom to choose where do you want to start, camp, collect weapon, and choose the way you want to play. Be it stealthy, frontal assault, avoid-combat-type, camping type, moving from one place to other (by foot or car) and so on.
-Realistic experience: if you hear gunshot, you duck/prone and take cover. If you unlucky enough you'll get  hit but not knowing where the duck that shot came from.
-Element of surprise: The element of real world + randomness + alertneess: The game can end (you got killed) any second, predicted or not. So be prepared for anything!
-Immersiveness : THE BULLET CASING that has been shot, landed on the ground and IT GIVES OUT THAT ""TING"" sound hitting the floor. Awesome 10/10 for small detail!!!
-Smooth Gameplay (character movement is already smooth),  but it can do better like KF2 did.
-ROLEPLAYING! Assume yourself as squad leader/point leader or follow each other and guard their backs.

Cons:
-No tutorial for beginner players. You just gotta grip the game by yourself.
-No language divider: CHINESE SPEAKING PEOPLE in ENGLISH game? Please make like DOTA 2 (languange preferences) so I can choose what language we can talk to each other. I got my team wiped out because we did not coordinate well (they cant speak english). Even in the American Server I still encounter chinese-speaking people who cant speak english. 

The price however is a bit too much for me. I DO NOT recommend this game for the current normal price. I'd rather play the mobile version, most of my friends play on mobile phone instead of expensive PC. 

This game does not require you to grind (ingame money is for cosmetics only) therefore those who have limited time might enjoy this game, as you can jump in and out game freely, like Warframe. 

Conclusion:
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
Just play the mobile version. Same concept, same gameplay. Free of charge.
Most of my friends play there anyway.",1506313647,1698055662,False,2,0,0.531224668025970459,0,True,False,False

That said, the game has definitely lagged behind. About 250 hours into PUBG I tried Apex Legends. I hated Apex at first, it felt so cartoon-like in comparison to PUBG. But, I eventually ended up playing Apex a lot more. Apex is much more refined with regards to smoothness of movement, player inputs, and environment interaction. The graphics are a lot better as well. PUBG always felt sluggish when it came to, say, picking items up.

Today I ran PUBG for the first time in a few years to see how much things had changed. For the most part, nothing has changed, except for a KFC sponsorship. Third person mode seems to be where most players are playing too. PUBG has become Fortnite. The graphics are still sloppy. Even on ultra settings it's like everything is drawn at a lower resolution and with jagged edges.

PUBG was a fun thing to do before Apex came around, but that's about it.

I have been playing since the release on steam in early access. At first everything except for the gameplay was a nightmare. But it also happened to be the only game in this genre (battle royal) that wasn't arcade (like Minecraft hunger games mode), so it became very popular despite it being shit.

When I last played in December 2020 it was less shit, but still kinda bad. They fixed some bugs, and improved on the visuals and performance, as well implementing new maps and weapons. But the game still crashed so often, server performance was very bad, the game often wouldn't even start and there were still a lot of game breaking bugs. 3D sound was a joke at close range and the amount of hackers was insane.

I never wanted to touch this game again. But it just kept calling. After another 1,5 years I decided to give it yet another go. And to my surprise: There was a good game. It no longer crashes, the visuals and performance are enhanced even more. The sound appears to have been fixed. Everything about this game finally feels solid and fun. The only problem remaining are the hackers. The devs are claiming they are banning 100.000 hackers a week, but seeing the player count, I think these are false numbers. The amount of hackers remains very high, which is to be expected now that the game is free. Despite hackers killing you in like 30-40% of your matches, you can just start a new game quickly and try again.

I can finally recommend this game, though you should keep the high likelihood of hackers in mind.",1595591667,1697995971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's standout qualities lie in its smooth gameplay and immersive environment. However, there are a couple of aspects that leave room for improvement.

First and foremost, the game excels in providing a seamless and engaging gameplay experience. The gunplay is sharp and immersive, keeping players hooked for hours on end. PUBG's core mechanics create an intense and enjoyable gaming experience.

Nonetheless, there's one glaring issue that detracts from the game's immersion factor: the vehicle exhaust sounds. In a world set in a post-human era, it's hard to believe that vehicles would sound as pristine as they do. The level of detail and care taken in crafting the abandoned island is impressive, but it raises questions about the supposed isolation. Rust and weather-induced wear on vehicles would affect their sounds. This would have been a welcome, nay necessary addition.

During a personal experiment to test this hypothesis, I was abruptly interrupted by a silenced AWM sniper shot.

Air tire pressure is another factor that seems ripe for exploration. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the skydiving simulation in the game is top-notch, contributing to an overall impressive rating of 102.56/103.45.",1534276253,1697931507,False,1,3,0.5,0,True,False,False

I played other survival games, such as DayZ and Miscreated. I was more attracted by the realism that those provided in some cases worse, in some cases better. The feeling of a squad working like a machinery was also something that I craved for but couldn't find it in the games mentioned or was taken to really high levels, such as Arma III or Squad that imposed dedication and time or didn't appeal to most of my friends. Sometimes, a game comes and takes people by storm, for whatever reason and I think Playerunknown's Battlegrounds achieves that with a punch in the face of people who do not coordinate well. The focus of the game is not basic survival where you can play endlessly by simulating your lunch, eating canned beans and drinking soda. It will not put you to grow tomatoes or run to the supermarket or gas station to pick up groceries while your room mate redecorates your apartment by moving walls and cutting trees for 3 hours straight. It's not like that isn't fun, but in PUBG you simply do not have the time for it. You need to run, hide, shoot, run, take a breather, drink some energy drink to run faster and take some painkillers for your feet because you still have to run the marathon until you reach the inconveniently placed finish line* or manage to find a beautiful Dacia 1300 to rest your ass in after all that slaps you took from the pan hanging from your backpack. Yes. There are plenty Dacia 1300 and frying pans to save your ass and go around after you get a jump-scare that will even make your cardiologist give you a call as you choke on a shotgun aimed by some dude in his tights sporting a bulletproof helmet while sitting in a bathtub. Did I think this game will be fun? No. Do I think this game is fun? It gives you the freedom to spawn in almost any location, sometime post-2004 in a remote place, untouched since the early 70's. It gives you loot, it gives you friends, it gives you heads to aim at, run over or drown. You can play the long version of the game by running and crawling or you can rush through the map on a motorcycle with your best friend and that other guy you sometimes play with in the sidecar, squeeze in and pray in a squad of 4 in a 4x4 in off road vehicles, ride in style in a Dacia or drive in a race car that looks like it was ""born"" by a more Eastern European version of Mike Evans. The tools you can use to subdue your enemies range from crowbars and 15x sniper rifles to smoke grenades and flashbangs. Player customization reduces to a few items. Rush through the looks of character you create because the only thing that matters after you slap a motorcycle helmet and a gas mask is whether you want the enemy to shoot you in the breast or dick. So this game is as fun as you make it to be. Of course, it's amazingly hard to overlook the unfinished mechanics, the rather crude graphics, less-than-average sounds or the fact that it throws one hundred people in a single map. Yes, 100 screaming people go in, 1 really sweaty person comes out. And really, that is it!
*Note: The finish line is actually a circle of last jerk standing. Because if you're not a jerk and pass that Falcon-punch kill in the fist seconds because the other guy has no weapon, it'll come, hunt you down and kill you minutes later. There's no way of making friends after yours died looting while wearing horse glasses.",1499131082,1697918678,False,0,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,True

⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 Stars) - A thrilling battle royale experience with a caveat

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has established itself as a pioneer in the battle royale genre, delivering an intense and competitive experience. However, it does come with a fair share of challenges that are worth noting.

🔒 Battling Cheaters - A Constant Struggle 🕵️‍♂️🚫
One of the persistent issues in PUBG is the presence of cheaters and hackers. The studio's efforts to address this problem by banning fake accounts and cheaters are commendable, but the battle against these disruptions continues.

👫 Best Played with Friends - Teamwork Triumphs 🤝🎮
PUBG truly shines when played with friends or as part of a team. Cooperation, communication, and strategizing with your squad add a layer of depth to the game that can be challenging to replicate in solo play.

🔫 Variety of Customizations - At a Price 💸🛍️
The game offers a wide array of customizations, from skins to weapon skins and more. These items can enhance your gaming experience and allow for personalization, but they come at a cost that might not be affordable for everyone.

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS continues to be a top contender in the battle royale genre, offering thrilling firefights and strategic gameplay. The ongoing battle against cheaters is a notable challenge, and while the studio's efforts are appreciated, it remains a point of concern. If you enjoy team-based play and can overlook the occasional hiccup, PUBG remains an exciting and competitive gaming experience. 🎮🤝🕵️‍♂️💸🚫🔫",1697905564,1697905564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And its not like its every now and then it is pretty much eveyr time you get killed in a game is most likley a cheater. Then you spectate and its BAM right there you report and yet nothing. 

It makes the game pretty much unplayable for a poor schmuck like me, because I cant pay for a subscription to cheat as apparently these rich kids. 

Its aweful to play it. 
I recently just got back to the game and I cant tell if its the same amount of cheaters or if they are more now. I actually think they are more... First report I did, was so obvious I almost laughed at it and BOOM the guy got banned..... WAIT FOR IT... for a week... a week for cheating... If they started banning people for real when they cheat it would probably have an effectm but its so political and business minded I will quit playing the game and I hope many like me follow, so the rest of them cheaters can sit and cheat together and bring down the game with it as they already do for us normal fools!

Update: Started playing again and it still has a severe case of cheaters which is very sad. I dont know if reporting has any validation but it is so many obvious cases. Its too bad as it could be a fun game. But keep in mind I play Warzone too and it has similar issues, maybe the cheating comunity has grown too large with mordern software and the game companies cant keep up. I dont know, but it is defenitly killing these types of games.

UPDATE 2023 SEP 27
Its like always a nice game to play with friends but it has a serious cheater issue still

UPDATE 2023 OKT 21
Its unplayable, its every game you get killed by a cheater and it seems that is the only way to play the game. They should just add cheat so everyone has the same chance. Im leaving PUBG now for other less cheat suffering games. I also never spent a penny on the game as I wanted to but refused because of the cheaters. I would easily but this game for 50 bucks, to have a cheat free experience.

Game used to be fun, but PUBG refuses to do a proper job against cheaters. Set all of the optimization issues and terrible development choices aside.... and PUBG would still great without the cheating plague. Many casual players left over a year ago. If someone constantly dies to better players, and also constantly dies to same level players or worse players who are cheating, who else is there to beat? No one. Lose all the time = not fun. They're long gone. 

I took a 2 month hiatus end of December because I thought the cheating was getting out of control (and it was). I come back in early February feeling refreshed and hoping for a change and that PUBG had finally gotten its act together after years of f*** ups. Nope. Find 20 cheaters (probably more) in 40-50 games. I walk away again for a month. Come back one random night and encounter 3 cheaters in 5 games. 2 more months off brings us to tonight. First game maybe got unlucky. Second game two teams of cheaters fight it out at the end of the game. Players like UPC-BB and wwwww555555 is all you see now. wilma_digfit took multiple seasons to ban. Then you have SN1PER-HUNTEr, You_So_Sad, Seattle_ZuiShuai all banned but after the damage is already done. Over 1000+ names on a list I started keeping 2+ years ago. If there was ever a time that there are cheaters in EVERY SINGLE game you play, it's now, and back in the first half of 2018. Cheaters teaming up all the time means the anti-cheat isn't working. Let's be honest, it never worked, and it's slowly come to this. It may have worked too well at one point, cheaters were scared to buy another account because they may have gotten banned pretty fast. Then PUBG eased up to increase returning (cheater) customers, and the flood gates opened. Cheaters own the game because PUBG allows it. They ruin a game that could have been a Top 5 game of the DECADE and could have had a life span comparable to CS:GO and LoL. I wish I was rich so I could pay people to uninstall this game and never play it again. Not sure this game has ever been rated above ""Mixed"" on Steam over its entire lifespan, but it deserves much much worse. I wish I had 3 hands so I could give this game 3 thumbs down.

There is no option for reviving teammates so most people when they die just leave meaning there is no reason to use mics and get to know someone or try to add them, they don't want to wait until you die to play again. The cheaters in this game like all games these days is just 50 50. I think this mainly is just from the game being free to play.  I don't know if pubg would attempt going back to purchasing the game but with the amount of account bans they show per week, this seems to be the last option. If you play a lot of matches then cheaters are not really that frequent from what Ive played.

The rush of adrenaline when you outsmart your opponents and secure a hard-fought victory is unparalleled.

The game's graphics and attention to detail are truly impressive. From the realistic weapon models to the intricately designed environments, PUBG creates an immersive and believable battleground. The maps are diverse and meticulously crafted, ranging from dense forests to urban cityscapes, providing a variety of tactical options and ensuring that no two matches are the same.

Furthermore, PUBG offers a wide array of weapons, equipment, and vehicles to enhance your gameplay experience. Whether you prefer a stealthy approach or an all-out assault, there are options to suit every playstyle. The game also encourages strategic teamwork, allowing you to form squads with friends or join forces with other players to increase your chances of survival and domination.

The continuous updates and additions to PUBG ensure that the game remains fresh and exciting. The developers actively listen to the community and implement improvements, new features, and events, keeping players engaged and coming back for more. The commitment to maintaining a dynamic and evolving gaming experience is commendable.

Lastly, PUBG's esports scene has gained significant traction, with competitive tournaments and leagues attracting top players from around the world. This not only showcases the game's immense popularity but also provides an opportunity for players to test their skills against the best and potentially earn recognition.

In conclusion, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is an electrifying battle royale game that offers an immersive experience, stunning graphics, and strategic gameplay. Its intense multiplayer battles, diverse maps, and constant updates make it a game worth investing time and support into.

PROS:
 Graphics are good
 Sound is good overall( i think the footsteps sounds are over-exaggerated).
 Variety of Weapons, accessories and weapons behavior.
 Erangel is Great.
 Vehicle physics are good .
 Team-play is key to success while playing in Squad mode.
 Great Learning curve. It's not a game for everyone, requires time to become any good.
 Best Battlegrounds so far...  Great reward feeling when getting a Chicken Dinner.


CONS
  Netcode is bad, really don't compare to ""Source"" games, it is too delayed and inconsistant, even affecting frame-rates at times(independent of the gpu you have).
  Enemy Draw Distance could be greater, 1,5 to 2 km would be great.
  Too many bold ultra-colored infantile clothes and items. This game had a ""realistic"" appeal to it. Those items make me fell I'm on a trance show or playing Fortnite, that's a shame.
  No more options to filter the map I wanna play in.
  Some items are too expensive to even wish(Average Brazilian wage is about 250 U$ dollars, some of you packs costs this much).
  Lots of Cheaters
  Too Many boots. They poop up anywhere randomly and see trough vegetation, what piss me off sometimes, spooting my position to real enemies..
  Not a Brazil inspired Map?? Come on...

HINTS to DEVS:
  Make a Brazilian beach or Favelas inspired 8x8 km map.
  Reduce footsteps sound radius distance, to 15~20 meters max.
  Make Higher Drawndistance for players and trees, 1km is too low to play with some sinper rifles.
  If can be done, improve netcode for smoothest performance(I know a game with 100 players tend to have those problems).
 A classical ""servers list"" search feature would not be a good idea??
 
Final Thoughts:
 *  Its one of those games that you either Love or Hate at first. Then you learn more to play and it will be a love-hating circle, till you get your firsts chicken dinners. It still piss me up sometimes, but when I try to play other alike its not as good as a experience.

TIPS For Beginners.
 ---> Go to training-map and test various different settings for you hardware mouse Sensitivity (DPI) with the % adjustments on Options Menu for every perspective, shoot various weapons(ARs, DMRs, Pistols) with different Scopes and Red-Dots till you find the best scenario for your play-style. It works wonders...

*original review below is from december 2017 holy shit im old*
With the release of the 1.0 update, the game has gotten significantly better.

- The game's optimization is much better, before 1.0, i would get around 50 - 80 on Erangel (The original map), but with this update i get around 80-100 on it, and on Miramar (The desert map), i get about 90-120

- The vaulting in my opinion is very smooth, but could use some fixes, it seems sometimes inconsistent on what you can vault on and can't. It also looked much cooler in the original reveal trailer of it than it does now, but i suspect thats for the sake of first person, because rolling in it would be very annoying, but thats just a visual thing. I do appreciate being able to have a key dedicated to vaulting, as it does seem a bit more consistent than the jump/vault key.

- The UI looks very nice, especially the new main menu which is a HUGE upgrade

- The new sounds for vehicles make it easier to tell which vehicle is which

- The new bomb zone sounds sound awesome",1501641067,1697465970,True,0,0,0.479397773742675781,1,True,False,False

Developers don't care about fixing the game at all because 
why not add more skins with each and every update since that is more important than FPS drops and 
anti-cheat software.
It is very easy to notice in game that when you face a streamer, many of those use scripts and all
sorts of other hacks that are not being detected.

Tencent/Kraafton/PUBG  are selling these cheats themselves over many different affiliate websites.
If you do a little bit of network and IP tracking it all leads back to them.
PUBG partners are protected even when it's 100% clear that they are using cheats.

Each and every update is just about filling up the marketplace instead of QoL improvements.
They added a new gun in recent updates ( dragunov ) which is heavily unbalanced but when community says that we want QBU and QBZ in every map they don't do it.

I for instance play only ranked matches and want to use those two guns but i can't because if i want to use them i am forced to play normal matches which are even more cheater polluted since the game went F2P.

As someone who has wasted few thousands hours in game hoping something would chance i would not recommend this game to anyone in this state.
And don't let pro PUBG matches fool you, the every day matches we play are becoming almost impossible due to how many cheaters there are.

This is not a rant, it's the real current state of the game. 
I am positive that majority of you who read this comment would agree with me.

One way to start making a change is to do a heavy boycott and not buy any season passes or stuff in the marketplace unless they start making real changes to the game otherwise it will all go completely downhill where will be no return.

I myself like many of the skins and whatnot but i would never give them money for them until they start thinking about us PLAYERS and not their corporate benefit because when the game goes down they will still have a fat bank account and we the PLAYERS are the ones who will have wasted our hardly earned money.",1697361075,1697361075,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

When i first got this game it was amazing, a whole new experience and for a long time i thought i never would get bored of this game. Back from August up until 1.0 the game was great. Although there was the problem with all the Q-qun accounts and chinese players that didnt really start until November. If Bluehole had focused on fixing the problems with the game like cheaters and the chinese community in general things may have turned out better; but instead Bluehole felt like sueing their competetor Epic games because for the reason ""We are worried that fortnite may be trying to replicate the feeling that PUBG is known for"" which is an absolute bull shit reason. Those are the reasons for the downfall and why i can no longer reccomend this game to people. I honestly like the gameplay of this more than fortnites but i refuse to play both at this time.

Early days the game had lots of bugs and sometimes the game was hard to play from cheaters and bugs, now game play is much better more maps guns and cars have finished off this game nicely.
My biggest problem with this game is the now cluster of a UI and crafting for skins, it's clunky and just not good at all, at launch it was simple easy and almost good. The micro transactions aren't forced at you as bad as many other games but they're 100% there in full force and is honestly getting worse the longer the game goes on.
Cheaters have always been a massive issue and they're definitely still there but not majorly game breaking like it use to be but you will still encounter the odd cheater
