The game features two regions, Hirschfelden and Layton Lake, each with its own unique flora and fauna, weather, and terrain. Players can choose from a range of weapons, tools, and equipment to aid them in their hunts, as well as customize their character and lodge. The game also supports online multiplayer, allowing players to hunt cooperatively or competitively with up to seven other hunters.

The game's strongest aspect is its stunning graphics and sound design, which create a convincing and atmospheric representation of nature. The environments are richly detailed and dynamic, with changing seasons, time of day, and weather effects. The animals are also well-animated and behave realistically, reacting to the player's presence, scent, and noise. The sound effects of the game are equally impressive, with ambient noises of the forest, animal calls, and gunshots adding to the immersion. The game also features a relaxing and fitting soundtrack that complements the mood of the game.

However, the game is not without its flaws. The game's pace is very slow and requires a lot of patience and perseverance from the player. Tracking and hunting an animal can take a long time, and sometimes the player may end up empty-handed after hours of searching. The game also has a steep learning curve, with many aspects of the game being poorly explained or not explained at all. The game's user interface is also cluttered and confusing, making it hard to navigate and access the game's features. The game also suffers from some technical issues, such as bugs, glitches, and crashes, which can ruin the game's experience.

The Hunter: Call of the Wild is a game that will appeal to those who have a genuine passion for hunting, or those who enjoy nature simulation games. The game offers a realistic and challenging hunting experience, as well as a beautiful and relaxing exploration of the wilderness. However, the game is not for everyone, as it can be frustrating, boring, and inaccessible for those who are not used to the game's genre, mechanics, and pace. The game also needs some polishing and optimization to fix its technical problems. The game is a niche product, but a well-made one for its target audience.",1647986945,1708902215,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game demands patience, particularly in the early stages. I started in the expansive Layton Lake District reserve, where I continue to hunt and complete quests. My first successful hunt came after several hours of gameplay. Initially, I kept inadvertently scaring off animals without even seeing them. I then discovered that moose were the least timid creatures in the area. I set out to hunt a moose and managed to stealthily crawl within shooting range. However, due to either the insufficient power of my starter weapon or non-fatal shots, the animals would flee, wounded, and I couldn’t find them. My first successful harvest was a moose cow, which I stumbled upon accidentally and managed to take down with several point-blank shots from various weapons. She took me down in the process as well. 
With time and practice, I’ve honed my skills and can now harvest animals with relative ease. However, certain animals still demand patience, a skillful approach, and a well-placed shot to a vital organ. Additionally, some quests present quite a challenge, requiring not only patience but also a dash of creativity for successful completion.

Overall, I really like the game. Even after more than 200 hours of playing, there is still a huge amount of content left. I appreciate that this isn’t an arcade game, but rather a game that closely resembles real hunting (as much as a game can). That being said, there are deliberate assumptions in the game to simplify certain aspects. For instance, I don’t believe that in real life, wild animals would allow you to get as close to them as you can in the game, or that they wouldn’t notice your flashlight at night or your dog barking. However, I think the developers have managed to strike a balance, making the game appealing to both supporters of realism in simulation games and casual players who might be put off by excessive realism.

Many people complain that most of the content of the game is locked in the DLCs. The DLCs do bring a lot of additional content. However, the base game alone has enough content for hundreds of hours, and the DLCs are not expensive, especially when they are on sale. 
At present, the content offered by the two reserves in the base game sufficiently meets my needs. I have yet to explore the reserves introduced in the DLCs, as I intend to complete the quests in Layton Lake and Hirschfelden first.
Since the game has enough outposts for fast travel, it won’t take much time to get to any location on the map after you unlock the outposts (use the lookout towers to find them), and walking adds to realism. But if you’re not a fan of walking and want to make your life easier the ATV DLC and the Tents and Ground Blinds DLC should be the first ones to consider purchasing.

So, whether you’re an avid hunter, someone who has never hunted but wants to experience it, or simply a nature lover who doesn’t have the time or opportunity to venture outdoors, I recommend this game to you. By the way, the game’s depiction of nature is truly beautiful. 
I don’t hunt in real life because I can’t bear to kill animals. However, this game allows me, and many others with a deep-seated hunter’s instinct, to fully engage in the thrill of hunting and tracking prey without harming a single real animal.",1706916539,1708384682,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I'm going to start this off saying this: 
I love this game, it is one of my favorite out of my entire steam library of 100+ games. 
The reason for not recommending it is that it still has major issues with DLCs and paid maps. I would much rather wait longer for a DLC then get a broken one. Two of my map story missions are broken and I cant continue them. When I buy a game I expect it to work. A few bugs here and there are fine and can be easily looked past. For example on the ATVs in the game if you get off it at the wrong time on a hill you can be launched across the map. While frustrating at times it is actually kinda funny. However I can not look past story missions being broken for this long. Once these bugs are fixed and I can continue the story mode I will write a better review.",1597840349,1708252294,False,4,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,False

But this games item/weapon swap and selection is really slow and frustrating, also whoever came out with the cabin storage system just did not think it through. if I buy ammo for a gun, I shouldn't have to pull it out of storage then put in in my inventory then select which weapon I need it on. When there is only one weapon running that ammo type in my inventory!!! Also the company that made this game seems to be cash hungry. The base game comes with nearly nothing but two maps and some guns. So unless you buy a over priced, mainly filled with junk dlc pack you will have to buy individual dlc items. The things that didn't come with this game should seem really basic and is kind of ridiculous they would ask you to buy them. Such as hunting dogs, four wheeler, better weapons, and more maps.

 Still haven't seen a GREAT ONE in over 455 plus hrs I have numerous diamonds but Albino's among the rest are very very hard to find. 

Pros: 
1.. Graphics.
2.. Always something to shoot.
3.. Very relaxing.
4.. Lots of potential. 
5.. Multiplayer is fun.

4. Cons:
1.. Other animals could use a boost like the tru rack system. Something obviously bigger sized for the weight like bears. Should be bigger then one another not all the same size shapes. Same with deer.
2.. Trophy room that will show stats for kill distance and if mythical or legendary instead of basic stats need some rework.. 
3..  Bears just hang out with deer ?? Aren't they suppose to be fearful of one another lol. One is food.
4..  Shots are not well placed when you shoot something in the side moving regardless of tracking your target ahead bullets always hit the rear end. 



 Stuff that would be nice to see. 
1.. More predators 
2.. Stuff that tries to stalk you 
3.. Bears actually hunt other animals or eat or try to eat your kill. Same with other predators. 
4.. More bug fixes.
5.  More great ones.
6. More info in the trophy room like range of shot and location. Also show what vital you hit Instead of plain Jane info.  Same with stats for legendary and mythical shots..

 All in all it's a pretty good game. Get it on sale worth it.

However, persistent major issues detract from the experience:

1. Animals exhibit erratic behavior, freezing or getting stuck in terrain.
2. Bullets are hindered by invincible terrain and oversized tree hitboxes.
3. Walking on various surfaces produces different noise levels, but unfortunately, the generated sound often mismatches the surface. For instance, walking on short green grass may occasionally produce louder noise than walking on surfaces with small stones and sticks. This is bad if we consider that sounds do scare animals.
4. Utilizing trees and bushes for cover is inconsistently effective. Occasionally, a small bush can offer complete concealment, while a large tree fails to hide the hunter. It has always been like that, worsening notably after a specific update over two years ago. Unfortunately, the map that is affected the most appears to be Hirschfelden, which is one of the two maps in the base game. Despite developer awareness, there has been no public acknowledgment. 
5. The draw distance is limited, causing distant objects to appear pixelated or not rendered, even with maxed-out graphics settings. This significantly hampers immersion, especially when you are looking thru scopes or binoculars.
6. Sound levels remain unbalanced, a persistent issue where some sounds are excessively loud while others are too low. Despite multiple attempts by the developers to adjust them, progress has been minimal.
7. Getting stuck in missions is a frequent issue, and while updates occasionally resolve the problem, it's also common to face permanent obstructions. This leaves many players with no recourse but to start anew, resulting in the loss of hundreds of hours, although trophies in lodges are retained.
8. Foliage sounds, triggered when the player interacts with bushes or trees, frequently become persistent and replay even when the player is no longer in contact. This persistent and annoying bug appears to be unfixable, causing consistent frustration. And guess what, these sounds also do scare animals.
9. Save file wipes are not uncommon, occurring either due to bugs, cloud issues, mods, or prolonged absence from the game.
10. Certain sounds are consistently misdirected, a problem that started since an update 1.5 year ago, and a fix is still pending.
11. Volumetric fog causes strange lighting artifacts and pixelation when this setting is turned on, especially when there's a lot of fog against a bright background. They broke this setting by accident during a hotfix 1.5 year ago and despite numerous notices from the community, they haven't bother to fix it. They even claimed that they fixed it (twice). This setting is a must if you truly want to experience the game's atmosphere.
12. Multiplayer experience is much worse than single player. Often too buggy to be enjoyable. It has been said by EW multiple times that they haven't designed the game with multiplayer in mind. So be prepared for major issues if you are planning to play with friends, and make sure you've searched the forums before buying.

While the base game's maps are visually appealing, subsequent maps often seem low-effort, with less engaging missions. Buy the base game first and consider DLCs later, as the game's size remains the same for all players. Multiplayer allows access to DLC maps even without ownership.

The target audience is those who enjoy casual, patient hunting in a slow-paced, stealth-oriented game. For me it is more of a walking simulator with occasional hunting due to the numerous mechanics issues.

Lastly, the game description on the store page claims ""regularly updated in collaboration with the community."" Don't make the mistake to think that this is about mods. There's no support for modding, and it's even worse, mods are forbidden. There's zero collaboration with the community whatsoever.

TLDR: If you are looking for a serious hunting game, you'll probably be disappointed. The base game is acceptable though if you keep your expectations low. The graphics up close look great; it's an immersive experience, and can serve very well as a walking sim too, especially Hirschfelden which is one of the maps in the base game. Most practical DLCs: ATV, bloodhound, and tents.",1656508975,1707937439,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

each map is so unique and i love how free roam it can get, and also that it doesn't bind me to missions and i can turn them off or on depending on my mood. i've never hunted before IRL but it feels pretty realistic- until i'm shooting at a very specific bison like... 7 times and it gets bugged in game and stands still and when it finally drops it's still alive... i couldn't harvest the kill that day. 

OR when i spotted a herd of caribou in Yukon Valley; only intended to shoot a bull bc of the rack and when i did, the whole herd literally stood in game, bugged, couldn't move, so i just took 'em all out. my Bloodhound had a easily good time that's for sure. 

yes, i've dealt my fair share of bugs in this game, but it's not too bad, just not ideal when playing multiplayer w/ friends but even then we still find a way to enjoy our time. 

my only biggest concerns really revolve around the DLCs; while i'm very glad that i got the Master Hunter Bundle when it was on sale during December, i still found it very confusing that if i hadn't, i would need the DLC to even get the 4x4s.... i agree with other players that say the vehicles should just be apart of the base game. 

TL;DR: good game, should get for fun if you've never hunted IRL but like hunting sims, DLCs can be pretty arguable. breathtaking maps IMO, i even hallucinate seeing the in-game lit up animal tracks IRL when walking sometimes.",1707783794,1707783794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CoTW The Hunter is a great game to play if you are unable to experience hunting IRL or if your dream is to hunt other parts of the world. There is a large variety of maps with animals that you can hunt, collect, and display in a lodge. It's a great game for both avid and new hunters. The lodges allow you to track your progression over the months or even years which is great if you are a trophy collector/grinder. You can easily get distracted while exploring the beautiful maps. Even after playing the game for years I still find myself always coming back to explore where I left off or trying out the the new content. Keep in mind all games have bugs so I would be lying if I said the game didn't have any. But EW is on point when it comes to fixes. This is a great experience if playing with your friends or family.

BUT
Here's the thing...
That IS hunting. It takes patience and while there are some QoL stuff behind DLC paywalls... [spoiler] [i]cough[/i] tents, treestands, blinds. [i]cough[/i] [/spoiler]
The game is well worth playing even WITHOUT them. The stalking and tracking is almost meditative for me and is almost half the point of the game. The game is SLOW PACED, but there is a depth in scouting the area and doing the prep work to find the best place to wait.

I have run into a time where I couldn't sleep [spoiler] in a tent which I got as part of a bundle [/spoiler] as I ran out of money and had to do some tricky night hunting to earn enough to get to the right time to hunt what I was after.

THAT SAID:
SPENDING that time doing prep and hunting lesser game to solve the problem was rewarding and let me practice and made me feel like the [strike]hunter[/strike] Ranger or game warden that the game seems to be built around.

And that is another point. The game feels [b]LESS[/b] like a hunting sim and [b][i]MORE[/i][/b] like a park ranger and game warden sim at times.
[b]BUT THAT ISN'T A BAD THING[/b]
The game focuses quite a lot on 'Hunting as conservation' and 'ethical culls with minimal suffering' rather than the 'Only for a Trophy and toss the rest' style that some in the US might be familiar with.

I know where I live, hunting and fishing licences pay for most of the conservation and awareness stuff in the area and help KEEP the wilds..... well.... WILD

It is refreshing to see that reflected in game with the sort of hunts and missions offered:
Population control and culling species that are impacting the area negatively due to rising numbers.
Hunting invasive species.
Getting PHOTOS of wildlife for awareness pieces and articles.
Etc.

It is a slow game.
If you are looking for a TROPHY hunter with tag and bag mechanics..... perhaps look elsewhere.
BUT
If you want a hunting game where you can feel the full reward of slowly stalking and tracking game across the landscape or setting up and sitting in ambush in a routinely traveled route you identified through study...

Great Ones are destroying the game, there's too much focus on teleporting around to lakes, shooting animals and resetting the clock in the hopes you get a GO to spawn in.

Note: Got this on sale. Initial experience included buying the QoL DLC, namely the tents and the ATV ones, so the distance and ""saving"" weren't a problem. They really should be included in the base game, though, as others have said. tl;dr at the end.

[i]Disclaimer: [/i] I don't play games much, but I played Insurgency (2014) a lot before, and it had really satisfying and responsive weapons, so I'm mainly comparing theHunter:COTW to that game.

My main problem with the game is with the handling of the weapons, which is the focus of this review. 
The gun handling in the game JUST doesn't feel right or good. 

For example, on reloading. Using the revolvers, why does he reload so slowly? And of course, something like ""reloading while running"" is locked as a ""perk"". I wonder how many more perks are needed to get the character to a not-annoying level?

Moving on, the lever action shotgun has a similar painstakingly-slow reload sequence. Reloading the AR-style rifles also has this part where he seems to miss the mag well [b]every time[/b] as he casually brings up a fresh mag at a glacial pace? Gets old fast.

Reload cancelling should be part of the game as well. Sometimes, you just need 2 shots on the revolver, so Lclick should make him stop reloading and get ready to fire. It's so annoying to wait for the whole reload sequence when ""reloading to full"" isn't the only realistic way to reload, if realism is one of the game's goals.

Overall, the reloading animations seem so artificially slowed down, with the .357 revolver reload for example, looking stiff and robotic, and not in a good way.

The round count per magazine is cursed as well. Based on my research, some hunting places do have regulations on magazine capacity. (The one I saw was 5 rounds for semi auto.)

And, for games, I'm not for 45-round extended magazines in a slow-paced hunting experience, but the M1 Garand style rifle has the en bloc clip with just 5 rounds. They couldn't even make it an even number and pretend that in the game universe, their M1 Garands had 6 rounds per clip. 

And the AR-15 and AR-10 as well with the 5-round magazines. It seems like the hunter is nerfing his own hunting experience by not getting normal mags. Or are those locked behind a perk system as well? 
Maybe the reserve rules on round count can be different per reserve, so there's more variety: one reserve can have 10 rounds, another can have 5, etc.

On the topic of aiming, the ADS scope wobble is insanely nasty as well. It looks like the player is drunk holding the gun. It even happens when in the prone position. Is there no way to set the rifle on your bag or a rock or something so it's more stable? That, or have a bipod attachment. Seems like a basic ""realistic"" thing to add [strike]as DLC or something[/strike] to the base game.

Adding to that, the guy's aim gets all wobbly and tired (Elevated heart rate! Oh my!) after like 2-3 shots when ADSing. It does not seem realistic that the guy can hike miles and miles up and down mountains like in ""Lone Survivor"" carrying like 3 guns plus other gear no problem, but he can't shoot well after 2-3 shots. 

Other suggestions: 
[list]
[*] Don't wait for the newly-selected item/weapon to fully come up if you select another item.
[*] Have an option at the shooting range to retain infinite ammo, but have the round count per gun be respected, so reloads can be timed and included when practicing. 
[*] Better photography mode with changeable lenses, depth of field, focus distance, aperture, etc.
[*] Hotkey to remove all the added things on screen for better screenshots without having to wait to pull out the camera.
[*] Support for multiple save files
[*] Higher animal render distance
[*] More granular sound controls, like being able to turn the bike noise, wind, etc. down.
[/list]

tl;dr Overall, after hunting and tracking the animal, getting to the shooting part is just so unsatisfying and kills the joy out of the game for me because of the underwhelming weapon handling. I really want to recommend this game otherwise, because of the scenery and soundscape, but the weapons could use some work. At least the guns sound good.

I hope to revisit this title if they keep on updating it, as I haven't tried bows yet.",1707222324,1707222324,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics are decent and you can really 'polish' them off with Reshade.
It's not a realistic game to the max, animals aren't spooked by light, sight mechanics are basic, tracks are fairly easy to follow with the bright overlay (though I'd prefer Classic huntermate system), but the game doesn't offer much beyond hunting the rares and doing SP missions. It does offer a way to burn some time and can be fun with friends.
Multiplayer co-op is basic, some actual co-op style random missions/events wouldn't go amiss here (and in SP).
It feels like something is missing from the game, there's no skinning etc, random events, those ATV's are horrible (parachutes, gliders for funsies? Better vehicles? Horses?), some flavour on the side between hunts?

A few glitches and bugs... Audio on the wrong side of your player to the call, animal rustling when there is no animals around, certain maps do not AI well, the Cuatro Colinas for example; In several sessions and 90% of the time the AI will freeze on the spot, run as if stuck in the ground and just otherwise just derp out... Having tracked down mythical+'s in this only to see them not respond at all and bleed out on the spot whilst you stand next to them is very disappointing.
Sometimes tracks disappear entirely, whilst I would expect an element of randomness with tracks, a vital-organ hit with a medium bleed not producing a single blood patch over 200 meters with no corpse in sight and the dog just as confused as you are, or the tracks missing entirely is a problem, especially since most animals don't bolt in one direction and keep going, running circles around the area making it impossible to find anything.
The Hunt Club BETA is dodgy... Still.
And at the end of the day when you're done with the game, hard reboot the PC because it's got some kind of memory access issue and locks up the system after long sessions, or even blue screens it (on multiple systems).

The best part of it is that it showcases incredible hunting areas that one can actually visit in real life.

The worst part is that the gun-handling feels as if all hunting rifles weighed 30 lbs and have no bipods, and you have to buy ATV DLC to get anywhere in-game in a reasonable amount of time. It feels like the devs don't care about the core game loop and only focus on DLC.

Further, the animal AI and hit registration is terrible. I pumped moose full of .270, and it ran in circles caught on terrain. I pumped another moose full of .357 magnum with no reaction whatsoever. If you shoot a deer in the head (which is reasonable if you have a tree stand and just want meat) then the deer isn't guaranteed to die.

I fully expected to get bored and uninstall before I reached my goal.

This game pleasantly surprised me, granted this game is not for everyone but when you buy a hunting simulation you know what you're getting into.

The base game consists of 2 maps of a couple kilometers/miles in diameter that you can explore seamlessly without any loading beyond the initial booting up of the game. One set in Germany, and the other set in America, Each with 8 different animals with which to hunt, totalling 16. Initially it might not sound like a lot of animals but the game hooks you in with a trophy score system, of which you're chasing forever more incrementally higher trophy scores, each of which is separated into 4 tiers, bronze, silver, gold and diamond along with a worse than bronze tier which doesn't award anything and a special ""Great One"" tier above diamond which is for special spawns that have a unique skin.

Each map has a story associated with it, of which you'll be Hunting Z number of Y in X area with W weapon, though it spices things up by making you take pictures occasionally, tracking foot/pawprints (some of which belong to people), one quest that lets you choose to either take a photograph or put down a creature at the behest of two competing rivals (you can choose both without penalty or needing to time travel) and you even put out a fire at one point. 

The story is dictated to you by a single entity who acts as a sort of manager who interacts with your employers on your behalf, forwarding requests and payment upon completion, all the while dictating whats going on in these peoples lives as it happens, you never actually meet another human unless you join a multiplayer game.

I would say I'm a pretty average player when it comes to this game, but in order to complete both maps story mode (Of which I completed my collection of Gold or better trophy's on the way through) it took me 132 hours, I'd say that's pretty good value for money considering I only paid 5 dollars for it, 20 if you count every DLC I purchased.

You'll hear a lot of complaints about the nickle and diming the game does with its DLC, and I partially agree on the topics of the vehicle (Of which not getting it has no downfall beyond unlocking initial survey points thanks to the fast travel system) and the dogs (Which is actually a quality of life improvement when it comes to tracking bleeding marks, or not having to move from your hunting blind to capture ducks and geese, something i think should be in the base game).

Honestly you could buy the base game and have a decently good time without purchasing any DLC, but I have anyway and am looking forward to exploring Africa and Australia with my dog and my ATV.

On a footnote I feel like the game doesn't have much to spend your in game currency on, yet paradoxically I still seem to constantly be running out. Setting up your lodge just the way you like is very satisfying.",1706967396,1706967396,True,21,0,0.707452952861785889,0,True,False,False

        [td]If you are a huge lover of gorgeous environments that feel truly immersive and filled with life, this game is top tier. The lush foliage with the trees moving against the wind looks so stunning. After all of the time I play this game I still get a feeling of awe when I load this game up. The lighting is superb especially at night, and the textures are still really impressive with the fur, and foliage looking really impressive. This game still holds up so well in terms of graphics. Absolutely stunning that will still hold up well in years to come.[/td]

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]I never played a hunting game before in my life and never thought I would be into it, but this game changed my opinion. The feel of the hunt and stalking your prey feels so rewarding. Also some animals can get hostile towards you which is really cool to see. The weapons pack a punch and feel unique from each other. Many different kinds of species to hunt and every animal you do hunt has a trophy rating ranging from bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. You can collect the animal you hunted and show it off at your lodge. Many animals have different furs, adding to the rarity of them. The maps are really massive, promoting long distance sniping even which feels extremely rewarding. You can even check what part of the body you hit your target. Depending on where you hit the animal, they can bleed out really fast, adding to the score of the animal you've been stalking. The game is slow paced so if you are looking for a fast pace hunting game, this is not it. This game rewards patience and good shooting. You do have a perk system that can make it easier to stalk your prey, but be aware that you may find it difficult to track your hunt. Just be patient and don’t get distracted and you will find what you are looking for. Stealth and noise is super important as well, because if you move to a bush too fast you can alert the animal. Be slow, and quiet and you will be successful at your hunts. My biggest complaint in this game is the DLC’s. Most of the good stuff is locked behind a paywall. For example ATV, tents, treestand, tripods, lodges, camo’s, maps, and of course weapons. Luckily the maps can be played if you have a friend that has the DLC maps so you don’t really need them, but if you plan on playing single player then of course you need them. Besides that the gameplay mechanics are really well done and enjoy them a ton![/td]

        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Every map has its own story. Some are better than others but I never really cared too much about them. Luckily some of the stories reward you with some great hunts and weapons. Don’t expect amazing story telling or an in depth lore with these maps. The stories do a fine job, but I tend to get more distracted by hunting to to be honest.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]Multiplayer is really well implemented into this game. First of all if your friend has a DLC map and you don’t, they can host it and still invite you to join. Hunting with a friend was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend this experience if you plan on getting this game. It’s super immersive and addicting. One complaint is that you should not invite random people. Let's say you take down a diamond animal, the other player can just go to the animal and take it from you. Now you still get the money, but you can’t harvest it and save it to show off to your lodge. You can get random trolls so just play with friends only.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can add many hours into this game, especially if you own some DLC maps. The game can get stale on the base game since the maps are kinda meh. I have up to 155+ hours and have tons to do like hunt gold and diamond animals, get animals with rare furs, explore the maps more, etc. This game has a huge replay value to it and if you are a fan of hunting, you may add hundreds of hours easily.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is top tier hands down! The animals make their realistic mating, and hunting calls. Every animal sounds true to their real life counterpart. The weapons sound so incredible too. So loud and punchy! Shooting guns in this game feels so satisfying to me. The music is also pretty fitting for this game, although I just turn it off to get more immersed into the world and environments.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really had any issues with bugs. Placing tents can be kinda finicky and annoying at times but besides that nothing bad. The game feels pretty polished for the most part. I’m sure there are bugs in this game depending on the map, so do keep that in mind. I just didn’t really have anything jump at me that I saw worth mentioning.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is really good! Playing on near ultra settings, I never really had frame drops. A smooth solid 60 fps on my rig and I was actually surprised by that. The game is well optimized. Also I never had a crash or annoying stutters.[/td]

        [td]🏆Rating[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]For my first ever hunting game, I’m really impressed and it left a great first impression on me. The hunting felt so immersive and addicting and I was so shocked I was really into it. As a non hunter in irl, I can’t tell you how realistic it is but it felt pretty convincing. If you are looking to get into a hunting game especially with friends, I really recommend this game.If you can save some extra money you should get the “Season Hunter Bundle” or “Master Hunter Bundle” as that has many good essential DLC in my opinion to make your experience even greater.

If the animals in this game were anything like real life, I never would have hit deer in 2 different cars, because they would have run off when I left my driveway 25 miles away from where I hit them. The scopes in this game look like they came from a cereal box and are dirtier than my microwave window. The weather is ALWAYS bad. I cant see farther than 30 feet and it wants you to shoot animals 300 feet away. Not to mention you can hold your breath to steady your aim, but you better shoot within 7.5 milliseconds, or your gun is swaying worse than it is when you go through a 30 rack of Busch light before you go hunting. If you aren't holding your breath, the ""normal"" scope/weapon sway looks like a 97 year old with Parkinson's trying to hold a 9 foot long 200 pound rod steady. Trash. Trash is all I can say.

Overall I like the game and it does not feel like a grind trying to level up. It only feels like a grind if you are purposely trying to go after diamond animals. This game was very stable until many months ago when they introduced the bloodhound DLC. If you bought this DLC and installed it then you were introduced to many critical bugs in the game. A patch was released for this DLC which fixed some of the bugs but introduced more bugs.

Then when they introduced the Rancho De Arrroy map DLC, it injected even more critical bugs and even some game breaking bugs. I will not get into all the bugs here there are way too many. If you want to know more just go to the steam forums and read the bug reports and you will see them all listed there. Many people have gotten increasingly frustrated with the direction this game has taken. What was once a stable game has now become a bug infested mess. 

I hardly play this game anymore because of all the bugs. Some people have reported a lot of crashes going on, some people have lots of lost frame rates, audio issues, missing tracks, unable to fast travel from outpost to outpost. It is a real mess. EW released a patch in July/August to address these critical bugs. For some people it fixed some of them. But there still is a great number of people who are still encountering the same bugs.

Would I recommend this game?

As far as its potential, its game playing when there are no major bugs present I would recommend this game... BUT ONLY... If this games bugs were fixed. There are still some bugs that are there from the very start I bought it. Some of these bugs are important to me like missing tracks or tracks that are pointed in the wrong direction. It is still not fixed. I understand that each game has some bugs, but they are typically just minor bugs that do not affect the game stability and game play. But when a game becomes this bug infested and the enjoyment of the game is lost it's time to put the game aside and find something else.

I used to be a programmer and I can confidently say that all the bugs that are being reported and that I have run into are not hardware-based, but code based. That tells me that EW has either lost interest in fixing this game or they do not have programmers who are qualified to work on this game.

So I would not recommend this game if you do not like bugs in your game.

UPDATE 12/11/2021
After the release of the Mississippi DLC update. Things HAVE NOT gotten any better. There are still lots of previous bugs that are still not fixed. a few that were fixed back in AUG is broke again. It just doesn't end. This game is getting worst

UPDATE (11-18-2022)
I encounter my last game-breaking bug. I went to travel from Silver Peaks map to Rancho map (using H shortcut key). The game crashed. After rebooting and relaunching the game. It never worked again.

I DO NOT recommend this game at all with all these bugs

UPDATE (2/1/2024)
I played the game again since being off of it for 1 year. There are still bugs. The one glaring one is... after laying down bird decoys and then trying dismantle them (X button) it would remove the decoy, then it would put you in Photo mode. Then after pressing/holding X button it would deploy my Tent. After cancelling tent, I then had to move my camera up/down to get the ""dismantle"" X icon to appear so I could remove the next decoy. Rinse-and-repeat for the decoys. So frustrating.

Because of the bugs and other reasons, I no longer use the weapons for hunting. Basically I just use this game as a photography game where I just walk around and photograph each animal on each reserve. Its is challenging still to be able to get as close as you can. Other than that, I feel the game has not improved bug wise.",1630505886,1706822509,False,87,12,0.734965205192565918,0,True,False,False

Personally, I'm addicted to buying DLCs; the additional content adds even more depth to the game and keeps my interest soaring. Plus, the multiplayer side allows me to enjoy challenges with friends, making it an even more exciting experience. A must-play for nature lovers and gamers – it's truly wild!",1706486965,1706486965,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay loop is addicting. My only complaint is that getting new guns and the general level progression feels very slow, or maybe I'm not bad at this? I've never hunt in real life, but I love the outdoors and this hits the spot during the dead of winter. Overall this game is great, and an especially good deal on sale. Yeah there are micro-transactions, but the base game can be very heap and the DLC content appears worth it. Stuff like an ATV shouldn't be DLC, in my opinion, but you [i[can[i] fast-travel so it's not required, but I do strongly recommend it otherwise the game is pretty sloggish. The base game comes with two massive havens to hunt in, one of which is stunningly gorgeous and has a lot of things to hunt and do. For $10-$15 this game is very worth it, especially since the base game comes with two whole DLC level havens to hunt. If you consider it a $60 full price game, but sold at $10 and the rest of that $50 comes from what you want to buy via DLC.

9/10 game, extremely fun and chill. Only complaint is slow progression and some potentially annoying DLC paywalls, which is mitigated by a good sale (like $10) is perfect for trying it out.",1706417148,1706417148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Parque Fernando is an absolute mess. I don't know why this DLC got past QC. It's so overly baked with foliage EVERYWHERE that there are only a few areas on the map where you can actually see the animals. I've passed on the last two DLC's because of how poorly PF was done. The Animals in PF spook so much easier than in any other map, I simply don't get it. Possibly it's due to the PUMAS constantly CHASING the other animals. To top it off to finish the storyline mission you need a DIAMOND from EVERY species on PF. RIDICULOUS!!!!

Ducks fly WAY too high, circle too many times. SO many new species with no way to call them in. 

EW seems to have really been dropping the ball and seem to just be milking an aging cash cow without actually fixing anything or addressing the communities concerns. It's sad such a great game doesn't get the polish it deserves.

1-25-24 I've stopped playing this game due to the DEV's completely ignoring bugs, no real content in months, all they do is make garbage skins now. Very sad where this game has ended up.",1663207303,1706229939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After reaching out to tech support and receiving a quick response, my issue was resolved, turned out to be corrupt update files.

If the game crashes for you, try this:
-Right-click the game name in your Steam library
-Click Properties
-Click Installed Files
-Click ""Verify integrity of game cache""

If it tells you that files are corrupted, you can go to your downloads and move the game up in priority so they can updated immediately or wait for Steam to schedule and update them (which could take days).

Here is a link with additional troubleshooting steps they provided me with in case your issue isn't the same as mine: https://support.thehunter.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415698207890-I-can-t-launch-theHunter-Call-of-the-Wild-PC-

I'm changing my review to positive based on the great tech support provided, the game actually running and the initial screens and music being fantastic. I will update the review further once I actually get a chance to play the game.

Original Review:
Here is my experience with this game:
-Load Game
-See pretty background picture and hear beautiful music
-Click to skip account login
-Acknowledge that I can create an account at any time
-Watch game crash and want to send crash report

So for now I'll have to make this a negative review. Hopefully they will fix whatever the issue is so I can actually play the game and update my review down the road (hopefully to a positive one).",1704996934,1705689709,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Sure, you can play MP with a player who has a DLC with specific map, but when streamers and youtubers even encourage you to buy DLCs, that should speak VOLUMES. Beginings are always tough in every game, but here, you really are at a huge disadvantage, as perks and skills for sneakiness and stealth are higher up. So, it will be a huge grind until you can even possibly be a proper hunter. Also, if your computer is mediocre, excpect it to sound like a washing machine. I really should have refunded it while I could, but it was my Bday so I was like ''why not try something new?''

I will give props to graphics, as they are stunning, and the map is huge, which is both + and - : reasons being missions (won't spoil it but traversing really long distances and a basically waiting game for dozens of minutes at times for anything just to pass by) and also being relatevly slow in speed, both walking and running. It also makes it repetitive exploring new areas and having such big maps may be one of the reasons why my PC hates it when I play it. Again, you are almost obliged to buy DLCs, vehicle one especially. If you have lots of time or you enjoy the scenery, then this isn't as bad for you then. Also, regarding the maps, water areas are, compared to DLC maps, in most cases, very horrible for spotting and tracking. Highly recomend checking for yourself and if you do decide to buy DLC, be sure which one you get. 

As for gameplay, as I said, relatively realistic. It is good, as is the story and voice acting. My issue here may be that certain animals are almost unaproachable (this is where perks and skills at higher levels come at play, you really need them, but first ones aren't that good in my oppinion - look up a guide), or are scared for no reason. It also doesn't help the way animals move. Easily spooked even though they shouldn't be (there is a difference between rarer ones, as they spot you faster, but I doubt every fox and boar was a rare :D ) from distances greater than 100m-150m, even on low visibility and crouching. On the other hand, I got running like a maniac in certain parts and when I get into clearing, I spot a deer just a few dozen meters away, and sometimes it is rarer one. Inconsistent in my opinion.

Another very important thing - trophies. Yes, they exist, however, in base game (or was it free DLC, can't remember) you get a lodge, but you can only put 1 of EACH animal species in base game. So, if you caught cool Diamond ranked trophy of idk Roe Deer, and you have Albino Roe Deer, you can only put up one. You need one of 2 SEPARATE DLCs for the lodges that allows you to put around 200 (I think, definetly more than 100) trophies in total. 

Also, if I recall corectly, in one of the videos of youtuber LadyLegendXO, base maps earlier had more spawns/animals. It seems they reduced it (purposfully?), while DLC weapons and animals are both in abundance and better.

Just to be fair, my bad experience (apart from fear of computer exploding ofc) may be because this game genre may not be my cup of tea, or I just couldn't figure it out. Then again, there are lists on youtube with titles ''best starting maps for begginers'' and base game maps are always put last/worst, so take that into consideration. It's definetly not a game that is unplayable, but you do need a lot of time and grind. Also, it kind of breaks the immersion and/or is pointless to people who like singleplayer experience if you need to constantly go into other people's worlds.",1705611297,1705611297,False,0,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

However, I simply cannot recommend the ""base game"" to people, you need at least a few DLCs to fully enjoy the game, especially ATV. So, I'm going to recommend that DLC instead of the base game.

TLDR; [b]buy on discount[/b], if you like the game, then get the ATV DLC. Or, buy the bundle from the start.

[h1]More Rants:[/h1]
At first impression, I dislike the extra maps to be in paid DLC, but, its reasonable, same for the cosmetics and dog companion. Then, I realized [b]there's FREE DLCs[/b], so I'm very impressed that the game is evolving through time based on real world.

Also, I do enjoy the game with realism on the hunting experience, learning to be patient before I pull the trigger and so on. Then I realized, hunting is a very expensive hobby, as you need to spend money to buy better gears, and player need to buy DLC for weapon packs to get better gears, just like in real world, LOL.

Joke aside, its a very nasty DLC, because the ATV is the only vehicle in game and this has been complained since 2017 by many players from day one. I know its not going to change soon, so I'm going to suggest this to the devs: please add one more FREE DLC to unlock a lower tier vehicle and balance it so that player need to reach certain in-game level to buy it. (or make it an exclusive event, idk)

About non-dlc weapon, the default rifle and free ammo is good to go. Most rifles are decent, yet, the meta is quite obvious, so player eventually go for the same choices. However, the handguns, shotguns and bows are mediocre.

Handguns: I was given a free Sundberg 454 and I wanted its ""Tru-Vision Tritium Sights"" but need a very high handgun score (too grindy), which I think is badly balanced.

Shotguns: very limited, and suffers from the same needed score issue.

Bows: needed a perk called ""Recycle"" to retrieve fired arrow, which I think is another bad balance to put it too far late at 3rd tier, should be 1st or 2nd tier on the perk's skill tree.

Also, the skill and perk points are gruesomely slow to grind, PLUS, the reset cost is TOO MUCH, if a beginner is testing out skill or perk, such penalty is too much, should use a cooldown timer instead of in-game money.

Also, the ""Hardened"" skill should also slowly regenerate health over time.

Finally, some tech issues for the devs:
- Borderless Window should be in-game option, player should not need to configure ""/borderless"" in launch option.
- should have a button to toggle on/off HUD icons, like hide animal clues.
- when auto-walk is on, interact should stop auto-walk (like harvest, access cache, etc)",1704473642,1705489235,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My last gripe is that you cannot make the animals render in at further distances, your limited to about a 450 yard radius.

After that, turn off Global Illumination if you still need speed without sacrificing the other options. I have maximum settings on everything else and everything feels fine now. I can run a bit faster on minimum to medium settings but it's not worth the trade off.)

This game needs lots of work still, so I'm glad I got it at an 80% discount. Since Steam forces me to choose, I'll give it a plus, but I'd rate it in the middle. There's some rare moments where the game will slow down and the animal animations can be glitchy rarely as well. I am running it on a laptop, so it could just be me, I wouldn't know. The track and blood direction will also sometimes but rarely be flipped in the opposite direction when pursuing an animal. I was really hoping this game would go deep into ballistics and gunsmithing, but I still don't know if this game even has bullet drop or wind drift, because it doesn't feel like it, and there's no gunsmithing. The controls also feel clunky. The game progression also feels off, but that's not a big deal. I'm pretty certain some animals become untrackable and just vanish. 

The scenery can look incredible at times, especially with the camera, so I hope the developers work on the camera some more. The closest thing to a camera simulator I ever played was Pokemon X of all things, so there's opportunity here to monopolize on this. There's huge potential with the camera. The animals seem programmed well enough for my own satisfaction, but I live in the city, so I have little experience with the personalities and mannerisms of large wild animals. I've seen deer in the Everglades and they just stare at you from a mile away, while alligators don't do much. The internet is full of wildlife hunting videos, so the deer, moose, and bears seem believable enough, except that they run away instead of attacking you. 

I haven't played a hunting game since MS-DOS/Win95, so I had little expectations. Hunting and fishing games have a reputation for being lacking and boring, but watching rifle review videos got me itching for a hunting game. theHunter: Call of the Wild really hooks you in, thankfully. If it was up to me, I do a complete overhaul to make the character progress feel more dynamic. Like stats for accuracy, reload speed, tree climbing, running, hide/leather crafting, etc. that you'd expect from an adventure game. There's also no knife in this game for knife enjoyers, but a machete could be a good game mechanic to work on. I should mention it's not a survival game, so it's not like you need to cook and build a fire, but it would be fun to have campfire making. Other players would probably hate for me to suggest firearm maintenance, but I would enjoy cleaning and oiling a rifle just to add more to the game, especially if it improved accuracy and reloading. Gun maintenance and customization is part of what makes hunting fun. 

The lack of weapons in this game is astounding to be honest. I don't know if more will come later or just a copyright issue, but there's a huge lack in selection. I thought this would be the type of game where you get to simulate different types of cartridges, barrels, and scopes, but it's severely limited. I was hoping this would be the one game that lets me use a rifle chambered in 7mm-08, but at least there's a 7mm in the game, so that's nice. The .308 in the game is good. Most of the pistols are revolvers to show you just how small the selection is. It's just a game though, so I wouldn't even care if the developers made up their own rifles and fantasy cartridges. Imagine hunting with PCC chambered in 9x29mm Winchester Magnum or something silly like that. Why not? 

In the end though, this is one of those games that you can probably play forever. There are some in-game tasks to give you more to do as well. Most time is spent walking and there's little dialogue and no story, so it's perfect for having a podcast playing in the background as you play this. The in-game noises and music are good too, but not mandatory for gameplay. I've been enjoying my time playing in Finland, as it's been very scenic and cozy. Most of the maps are in the form of DLC unfortunately, not all of which were included in my sale bundle. I would only recommend getting everything on sale because some DLC seems too expensive for what you get, such as weapon bundles. Asia isn't well represented, so I hope India or Thailand is coming next. I also played a little bit of Germany, which has really thick shrubbery and small animals, so it's not so fun. The Russian Taiga may be my favorite since it is easier than the other two due to the snowy landscape and large animals. Finland is a nice balance between the two. 

It's difficult trying to rate and review this game because I haven't played other games like it for comparison. Do I really recommend it? I'm not sure. On one hand, it's enjoyable as a game, but on the other, it feels very lacking as well. As a shooter game, I would have to say no, but as a nature game, I give it a yes. It's nice change of scenery and style compared to other shooter games that focus on stuff like humans vs monsters, so there's that if you want something more real world, but the lack of guns kind of dissapoints trying to do that well.",1704153981,1705380625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A little buggy sometimes but improves with updates. You get a lot of hours playing this game and you don’t even realize it. Because you’re hunting and following tracks for hours. Especially when you hit an animal and you start tracking the blood or you put him down right away depends on the shot. You want to try to get a vital shot with the proper ammo so you can get a Diamond. Know if it wasn’t a diamond or a gold it means there was something wrong either you shot the animal with the wrong weapon/bullets because each rifle has classes for which animal and you need the bullets that match it. You feel like you can get bored easily but that’s when you can’t find animals. It is also very easy to scare them away. They flee once they hear footsteps you must be careful and not shift. There are lots of nice maps with different kinds of animals in them and there are updates to this date with new maps and new animals. Make sure to buy them when they go on sale that is when it’s worth it. Also some DLC weapon packs, etc. but it’s a very good feeling when you hunt one. To enjoy this game you need to be patience. Also you can try different maps playing multiplayer with other people keeping up the score of who hunts the most. But If you don’t own any of the maps that you are playing as long as the owner of the map is still playing that’s no problem otherwise you only have 15 minutes then you’ll get kicked out.

The variety of DLC gives you more options than you might ever need, providing even cosmetics to show off when playing online. While the game is fun solo, having a hunting buddy or an entire party turns this game into an absolute riot when things go well. There's nothing like ripping into a herd of elk to see them all go down for harvesting. Before I go on for too long about all the details, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game.

Get yourself in there and happy hunting.",1705281723,1705281723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
* Great atmosphere and ambiance. Just walking around the countryside is interesting and relaxing.
* Good variety of weapons and equipment
* Pretty good animal behaviors makes finding game not too easy or too difficult.
* Tracking wounded animals is satisfying
* Maps are HUUUUGE
* Fun and well done multiplayer co-op

Cons
* Interface can be a bit clunky with managing inventory transferring items from storage to character
* Radial menu to is also a bit buggy at times but nothing game breaking once you get used to it
* Graphics are not breathtaking but get the job done
* Items are very expensive to earn using in-game currency, but frequent sales make getting some of the content pretty cheap.

One huge gripe I have is paying to sleep, especially when you use a tent, or the cabin. Now it wouldn't be bad to charge if you say just hit pause in the middle of the map and advanced time that way. I get there's nighttime hunts on here, but sometimes I'd rather just sleep and start in the early morning. And since time moves like actual time and not ""game time"" its rather slow going to get to daylight.",1705115379,1705115379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just dont feel its a hunting game its more of a sit and wait game knowing something will spawn and walk in.
I feel if it was a hunting game there would be more prep into your hunt checking scrapes, creating mok scrapes, checking rubs, game cams to find where the buck is moving etc. I understand thats prolly hard for a game to do. I feel its made by non hunters or with hunter opinions. Idk just not a game for me as a real hunter.

However, I have noticed a particular issue that can be frustrating when I am hunting animals. Once I save an animal, I have no way of taxidermizing it later. Sometimes, I may not have enough money to do it immediately or I am hunting multiple animals at once, so I save the animal for later. Although I know that I can head straight to the lodge after a kill and taxidermize whatever I was hunting, but this can be difficult when the player doesn't have enough money as stated above. Therefore, I would appreciate it if the developers could add a feature that allows players to save the animals for later taxidermy. This feature would be a great addition to the game and would save players from the hassle of having to hunt down the same animal twice.

The game itself is fairly boring, and doesn't even live up to the depth of some original XBox games. Any animal can hear you snap a twig from hundreds of yards away, and somehow automatically know it's a human and flees. Your crouch movement speed is a snail's pace, but since it's the only way to not be a danger beacon to the animals in the area, you'll be spending most of the game at that speed. There's enclosures in the game that allow you to ""camp out"" and wait for animals, but it's pointless because you'll most likely be stuck there for irl hours waiting for anything to show up. The few items that are available to buy without DLC are absurdly expensive. I killed about 12 animals my first playthrough, and ended up around 8k. That took about 4-5 hours of gameplay....the average equipment upgrade costs between 5k-20k.

What's unfortunate is the moments where I was actually hunting and tracking something were enjoyable, and a part of me still wants to play because of that...but spending the vast majority of the game quietly shuffling from A to B ruins the experience for me.

> Graphics: The game was released back in 2017 and playing it in 2024 it has really matured a whole lot. This game does not only sound nice, it also looks astonishing. From a graphics point of view I'd rate it a high AA-title.

> Mechanics: Ballistic curve, different calibers, different animal that need a specific approach each. It is nice. Tracking a wounded animal feels real but sometimes the animal despawn. That is the only uncool thing about hunting. This game is possible to be played as noob or pro alike.

> Storytelling: This is the only point I always found very annoying. Unskippable cutscenes and ""calls"" from someone I am not interested in listening to. If you want to completely immerse yourself, it is probably still a solid 7/10.

> Bugs: Saves. Saves is the biggest issue. Your guns and scores will be saved correctly but everytime you join a map everything is reset. You have to go and unlock all the houses - over and over again. There were none other bugs I came while playing this game.

Overall rating: 9/10 - besides the quirky storytelling and the save-bug I would highly recommend this game. You need some time and also a calm personality to play this game.

Nice visuals, has some nice quality of life controls like ""G"" auto walks. I have pretty bad arthritis from working in IT and playing lots of video games. But this new generation of we sell you demo version is something I don't like to support. 

I did end up falling for the scam b/c its a pretty decent game, but I won't give it a thumbs up b/c the base game is basically a ""bait""(Hunting pun). 

The main issue with the base game is that you cannot buy tents, or vehicles without spending another $15 at the time I'm writing this. Also the weapon selection is pretty poor. I feel sad that I fell into the trap. but if you go into the game knowing you're going to be nickle and dimmed at every turn then its a pretty good game. I just hate that they had my 2 hours and my $5 dollars before I realized I had been taken for a ride. 

So with that I would say if you don't want to be a rube like me move onto game makers who release complete games and not grindy BS to squeeze some dollars off you.",1704766319,1704766319,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an insanely “comfy” relaxing game. The majority of the time is spent skulking around the woods waiting to hear anything and then doing the same while tracking prey.

This game is spectacularly immersive. The behavior patterns are realistic enough that I can really get lost in it, and track an animal for days. Or I can run through a swamp with a high powered rifle like a damn idiot, shooting at crocodiles as they attack me.

[h2]Short Game Description[/h2]
theHunter: Call of the Wild is a realistic hunting game that features many huge reserves, most of which are behind a paywall but are worth it. The unique problem is the abusive DLCs and the little appreciation for the game that developers are giving.
[list]
[*][h3]Positives[/h3]
Discussing the positives, it has huge reserves based on real ones, which don't feel repetitive as you explore, and many unique animals that pertain to that area. Secondly, there are many weapons to pick from, and you can customise the loadout you will be using to hunt by creating some hunting areas, which the game forces you to not hunt all the time in the same area because there will be fewer and fewer animals if you hunt there so much. Thirdly, the animals are hard to encounter, and you will need to track them with footsteps, need zones, drinking zones, and sleep zones, which will be good spots to ambush the animals if you are sufficiently observant. Lastly, the game has some missions and spots with lore that make the game a bit more interesting to explore instead of just being a straightforward hunting game.
[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]
On the negative side, and the main complaint I have with the game, which is the reason I'm marking the game with a negative review, is that there are too many DLCs, most of which are quite essential, like some weapon packs, the ATV, the dog, tripods, and tents, that are not justified to be behind a paywall, as they are necessary, and some of them feature bugs, which makes the experience annoying and is not something uncommon; it was something I experienced through all the gameplay. The reserves deserve every euro spent, but most of the DLCs give a huge advance and don't take that much time to programme.
[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]
To conclude, the game has many good points, such as giving a realistic experience with many varieties and some interesting lore and quests in each reserve, but it is quite disappointing to see all the abusive DLCs that are not that hard to implement, some of which are essential to play, giving a huge advantage against players without them, and it is even worse when you pay for some of them and have constant bugs. The game, despite the abusive DLCs, is a 7.25/10.",1704556628,1704556636,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As for realism and difficulty, it's an in-betweener. It isn't the ultra realism game with jamming, big wind speed corrections and high bullet drop like some sniper games. Neither is it some shoot and run game, there's a bit of strategy and discipline to it.

Having grown up hunting and being drastically disappointed by nearly every hunting game, theHunter: CotW is the only hunting game I've played that makes me ACTUALLY feel like I'm hunting. 

The gameplay is slow-paced and tactical, it requires you to either track animals stealthily and effectively, or familiarize yourself with their daily patterns and wait in a strategic spot/stand, and it relies on accurate vital shots to make kills. 

The game is far from perfect, has a handful of minor and major bugs, but the devs are active with fixing bugs and improving features from what I've seen. It's also a bit of a gamble whether the game will run BEAUTIFULLY or TERRIBLY on your machine. I've had PCs that were quite a bit under what I thought would even play the game run it like a charm, and I've had PCs that should be able to run fine lag so much the animations of everything were slowed down and I was playing the game in slow-mo. Still got a trophy elk that way, though.

BUT when this game runs right, it is an absolute dream of an experience. The gameplay loop is paced nicely, there's a very dynamic skill curve to hone over time with the gameplay loop in general, and it has quite a lot of skill curves to master for each particular strategy and piece of equipment. Each successful kill is extremely satisfying, each bad shot comes with its own challenges and opportunities to learn, and you can spend hours in the game just enjoying the scenery and it's still a relaxing experience. Hell, I've spent whole evenings just tracking a single animal and feeling more than satisfied enough for the night when I finally get it. It really does feel like hunting beautiful tracks of land. One of the best games [b] ever made [/b] for unwinding after a long day. 

[b] Tl;Dr Pros and Cons [/b]

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Actually feels like hunting
- Nicely paced gameplay loop, not too rushed, not too slow
- Beautiful scenery and graphics
- Deep skill curve
- Lots of different animals to hunt, all with their own strategies required
- Extremely relaxing and rewarding, no matter how you play the game
- Updated and bug fixed regularly

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Performance intensive
- Some machines just don't run it right
- Known bugs and issues. Some inconsequential, some hilarious, some awful
- DLC heavy, esp for duck hunting, displaying trophies, and additional locations
- Vitals system is extremely strict. Makes for great shot placement practice, but you can shoot something in the jugular and watch it just run away with a ""No vitals hit"" message bc the jugular does not count as a vital organ :|
- Shotguns shoot like 10-20 pellets max, so duck hunting is often a total joke.

I would like to see below gameplay changes and hope that EW will consider my suggestions to bring substantial improvements in the game. 

1. Main/side missions appear too hard 
2. Training modules
3. Demos or In-game strategy tutorials 
4. Map improvements  
5. Add more zones and more animals 
6. Inventory improvements 
7. Make rest times free
8. Game save feature 


1. The side mission says ""harvest 2 blacktail deer in Balmont"" but when you go to any nearby ponds in Balmont during blacktail deer drink times 1600-2000 there you will see no deers around in any drink zones. Putting pointers around drink zones on the map or mobile will also help the player, but they are not available. Introduce a radar HUD screen or a separate animal tracker that clearly shows the location of all nearby animals i.e. where they are resting/feeding/drinking. Add difficulty levels to the game - Easy, Medium and Hard. This should resolve most of the problems mentioned.

2. Tutorials on how to hunt different animals. I know this is a big ask but it is definitely going to help new players even if we can cover one animal from each class.
I think the highest class is 9. So, nine tutorials with tips should be sufficient to get any new player familiarised with training and along with this you can introduce ranking, trophies, ammo selection and any advanced topics in the tutorials itself before pushing player towards the main game.

3. In-game tutorials need to be available. How to track deer steps? What is the approx. safe distance to maintain? Which scopes/guns or ammo to use for an effective kill? 
It is unreasonable to expect from a player to experiment with all these just to analyse which is better or worse, that will be a waste of time.

4. In the map section, if you click Legend it will show all zones or other markings but the data is not organised in a way that could help the player. For instance, in the legend say 15 items are there (rest zone, drink zone, home, tent icons etc) and the player wants to have an ability to filter what they want to see on the map rather than seeing all junk that is available. Player may like to see only tents or bear tracks for example without having to see 100 icons on the map. A filter will be useful here.

5. Basically, there are very less number of animals corresponding to a mission. In the mission that I have mentioned earlier in step #1 harvest two blacktail ... it was way too difficult to spot any deers, not even during the time zone, not near any drink or feed zones. Guess this is the case with all the other missions. For instance, when you are on a coyote hunting mission, the game isn't showing you at least 10 coyotes wandering nearby the mission area for you to hunt. 

6. I bought a lot of ammo worth over $1000.00, but I didn't realise it was incompatible with the guns that I already own. This rendered the newly purchased ammo to be useless and my cash wrongly spent. The worst thing is that I can't even trade ammo back for cash or for any other category of ammo. That's a shame! I expect the game to prevent me from buying any ammo which isn't compatible with the guns that I own, or at least it should show me a list of guns only that are compatible with the ammo. Either ways when you purchase a gun, the system should show you all the information about which ammo is compatible and which isn't; vice-versa should also be true i.e. when purchasing ammo (all compatible guns need to be displayed). A proper table with select-able options and columns is all what is needed here.

7. Why do you need to spend $250.00 at an outpost to sleep? Isn't that supposed to be free? A new player will keep losing whatever little cash that they had earned only to be spent for resting at outposts. In my opinion, resting needs to be made free as a means of going back to the saved time instead of restarting the whole mission again. I think that is the only chance one can get their time back without spending cash at the moment.

8. There should be a feature to allow saving game progress to a savepoint. The player doesn't have to fiddle with time going backward or forward. Just introduce a game save feature that will allow a player to go directly to that savepoint. If they had forgotten to do something, they can continue the game from there anytime.",1704301541,1704317911,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

1. its been night in my game for 3 of my real life days. i cannot see anything. my light scares the animals away but i cant see the tracks without the light. you have to sleep to make it daytime, but the guy walks so goddamn slow it takes forever to get anywhere. 
2. walking is way too slow. running is too loud so thats not an option. 
3. i had to buy dlc guns to get a gun that actually works. then to get the dlc guns, i had to find an outpost. then to equip them i had to drag a bunch of stuf then to get ammo for the new guns i had to go to the esc menu and put the ammo into my guns. way too many steps guys its ridiculous. 
4. guns dont do any damage. i can shot an animal point blank but it does barely any damage at all. dlc guns are the only ones that function well, but then we go to #3 again. 
5. theres barely any animals anywhere. it took me 4 actual real life hours to find a group of deer, but then we go to the #4 complaint. damage didnt do anything and i lost them all. 
6. theres no actual tutorial. you just have to hope to catch the buttons on the side or go look at the interface keys in settings. i was just pushing buttons forever to try to figure out how to use my binoculars. 
7. the missions are boring and useless. go to this guys camp, find footprints, oh a piece of cloth thanks theres nothing else to do now. 
8. the weight is badly done. i cant carry a tent because of how heavy my 2 guns are, but then i cant get an outpost to replace the tent because im too goddamn slow. stupid.
9. cant buy better guns unless theyre dlc because the missions are sparse an stupid and thats the only way to get money. 
10. please add a sandbox mode for the love of god. if i wanted to actualy go hunting and take 25 minutes to find a single turkey i would go do it. this is a video game. make it fun not so dull.
11. Tried playing again. I have been hunting an alligator for a mission on the mississippi dlc for over an hour and have seen zero. FIX YOUR GAME PLEASE. there are no animals spawned. WHATS THE POINT

The game has very smooth game play and I find the story line very interesting. In my opinion I find the leveling balanced (not to fast, not to slow) along with earning money. Its not a game you'll beat in a day especially if your going  to run through all the story lines on all the maps and with that being said its a slower paced game overall. I love that they made weapon classes for all the animals and weapons in the game. The trophy lodges are a very nice touch I feel. I enjoy using the different tactics available to harvest my game whether its sitting in a treestand or stalking game through the brush. The wind can blow your scent in the wrong direction causing your prey to spook or they could hear you moving through the brush if your moving to quickly. Overall I love this game and it will continue to be a game I keep playing. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hunting.
The Things I Really Like:
-herd management
-variety of weapons and maps (if you purchase the weapon and map packs)
-story line on each map
-the look and feel of the game (map detail and fluid game play)
-the variety of animals from rabbits up to bison and unique animals like piebald deer and cinnamon bears
-the tracking and following blood trails

Things I Really Don't Like
-the ballistics seem kinda wonky, I don't feel like a lot of the calibers are given the power they deserve
-animals seem to run to far for a vitals shot (but that could be me being a crappy shot)

WARNING: this is NOT a 100% realistic hunting game so do not purchase this game with such expectations, BUT it is the closest to as realistic of a hunting game in my opinion that I have played.

Sound issues such as birds repeating and glitching out. 
Sound direction is a bit off from time to time. 
Auto save has had issues and I've seen this is common for others. I lost about 3 hours of game play which is super frustrating, gold harvests lost, close calls with buffaloes and lions, skills, traits and purchases all gone. Second time this has happened and a third time lucky I'll just uninstall it and request money back. No matter how good the game is, if you can't progress its not worth playing. A hard save feature or option outside of auto save could fix this. 
There could also be an indication while hunting that shows you your weapon/calibre may not be suitable for harvesting that particular animal. I do appreciate how this is not limited though, making it more realistic. 

I've only played one map, but good things are difficulty, animal behaviours, tracking is fun, weapon choice is great and graphics are nice. 
Both animals and players leave imprints in grass which is a nice touch. 
Animals actually attack you and kill you forcing you to re-spawn which is a bit more realistic and humbles you.

Arbitrary rules prevent it from being a great game. Arbitrary rules for 'game balance.'  Balance for whom, exactly?  It certainly isn't balanced for me, the player.  It is designed to limit your options & perpetuate the grind.  My purpose is not to bash the game or the Devs.  I really want it to be a great game, but I don't want to be manipulated, controlled into hunting a certain way.  Here are some of the changes needed:
1-EW changed spook radius with the last update & did not even mention it in patch notes.  Two issues with this: a-It was not broken & needs to be rolled back, b-Changing fundamental game mechanics without telling players is an unethical, unacceptable practice.  It must stop.

2-Carry Weight - I always carry a tent but you are severely penalized because it weighs 6 units.  This is a hike in the woods & hunting game so it is totally reasonable to carry a tent.  But, it currently precludes you from carrying all the other gear you need.  A weight of 2-3 units would be acceptable.   Backpacks with the noise & visibility penalty are a joke & not a viable alternative. Another case is the high tech bow sight with a ridiculous weight.  I did not buy that DLC because of it.

3-Ammo Class - It needs to be a broader range in many cases to be inline with hunting norms.  My pet peeve caliber is the 270 as it is my RL favorite.  It is not competitive in its current class of 4-8.  It weighs more than the M1 30-06 & is less effective.  It needs to be class 2-7 along with the 6.5 mm.  There is nothing unethical about shooting a class 2 coyote with a 270.  It is realistic & reasonable.  The 270 is one of the great hunting calibers & deserves more than being a locker queen or having its trophies unfairly penalized.  Other poor decisions include the muzzle loader which should be good for class 9 & the 300 needs to be for class 5-9.  Again, there is nothing unethical about shooting a 500 lb red deer with the 300.  These are artificial, arbitrary restrictions & not in any way based on reality.

4-Render distance is way too short at 400 m.  700 m would be more appropriate.  Maybe have a setting for normal & long so that lower end PCs can still use the 400 m.

5-Ballistics is grossly under powered in some cases.  The worst offenders are buckshot & 223 which have been way too weak forever.

6-The hunting pressure mechanism punishes the player for stalking on foot compared to blinds or tripods.  Stalkers should have the same reduced pressure.  

7-The economy is ridiculous & perpetuates the grind.  Tripods at 16,000 coins, blinds at 8,000, etc.  Cutting all prices in half would at least move it closer to being balanced.

8-The bleat caller is the only one for mule deer.  It needs to be at least 200 m.

9-Pheasants were a great addition but the implementation was not.  I gave up on getting them to fly & just ignore them.  How about if you whistle they fly?

10-Attacked in a Blind or Stand - These need to give you the same protection as a tripod.  I don't even bother to setup decoys & blinds on a map like Parque because you get attacked by buffalo while trying to hunt ducks.  Its just plain silly.

11-Animal Aggression - It is the most unrealistic, overdone, arcade feature of the game.  I have hunted in RL for over 50 years & no one I know has ever been attacked by a wild animal.  Not once, not ever.  Yes, it does happen but it is rare. Some days it can be fun fending off animals that want to kill you, but most of the time I don't want it.  Since a lot of people apparently like the survival game, we need an option to turn it on or off.

12-LOS - Animals should not have xray vision & be able to see you through trees, bushes, hills that are between you & them.  I suspect that changing it would be very difficult, maybe impossible with the current engine. 

If EW finally listens to average players like me & makes these changes I will not hesitate to change my review.  But, if they continue down the path of poor design choices like over the top animal aggression, not allowing my beloved 270 the ammo class it realistically deserves, then I am not going to like their final product.  For now, I don't trust that they will listen & change, & I will not spend anymore money on the game until they do.  The game design is too restrictive for my playstyle & it is not moving in my direction.  Edit: It is more than a year since my review & they have  not listened.  I still don't want to play it.

It was inevitable I would like this sim/game. This game gets a lot right. I'm curious about some things involving the realism (like whether certain animals congregate around water bodies or predators around areas with a high density of prey). I am a bit put off by the cheesy dialogue, but it is what it is. At least the gameplay is good. Siberia and Alaska maps are great. Shooting bears is challenging.

The game is kind off arcade like once compared to real hunting. Still a very fun game. 

Would highly recommend to buy the game on sale with DLC's, especially if the Quad is on sale.
You can always go into public servers, look around the maps to see if you really like the map.
Watch videos, and don't waste your time and money on things you don't like or need!

My only true complaint with the game is how textures look super fall away. The game looks great up close (to your character), but once your looking like 200m+ away, things really look different. 
If you want a more realistic hunting game, try Way of the Hunter. With more realism you may loose the fun that is hunting in a game.

I don't want this REVIEW to be so long, so I will write it short as I can. ★

► Graphics ( 10 ) - [b]You will be in love with graphics:) this game is perfectly designed for photographs.[/b]
► Physics ( 8 ) - [b]In sometimes, you will get stuck in any places or mobs.[/b]
► Gameplay (  9 ) - [b]Is pretty nice. You have to do some missions and of course to make RIFLE POINTS, HUNTING POINTS for unlock some guns, items in general.[/b] 
► Multiplayer / CO-OP experience ( 10 ) - [b]It's a great experience to play with a friend or with others.[/b]
► Shoting ( 8 ) - [b]I don't know what I should add here... but in sometimes I can't understand why I cannot hit, for example, a deer if I'm sure that I put the scope on it? By the way, the game presents a interesting recoil on guns ( a realistic one )[/b]

± I would say the base game doesn’t have much content, but you’re buying it at a very reasonable price anyway. 
- There were some problems in multiplayer, hopefully they have been resolved. 

Note: I think it will really prevent you from going hunting (this absurd thrill) because it has a gameplay close to reality. 
Hunting is not something I enjoy; it’s just something I can do in the game. I think this game dulls this absurd desire.

I'll update this regularly as I encounter bugs. Some issues occur only in multiplayer, and I mainly play with friends.

Bugs:

-Lots of audio issues. Something sounds left when its actually right. Hearing constant foot steps from a fixed location when nothing is there. My players own foot steps vanishing completely. Completely incorrect sound levels for a distance. These issues vary from annoying to game breaking. I usually experience 1 to 2 audio issues per session, the longer the session the worse some issues become.
- Bobcats scream volume is 10000% from all distances.

-DLC dogs tend to disappear and become useless 1 to 2 times per session. Reloading to a different area usually fixes it. This bug is well known to the developers.

-Desync in multiplayer is a common issue, fairly well known. The longer the session, the more bugs and issues you'll likely encounter.

-Guns tend to disappear until you fast travel, happening once every 2 to 3 sessions. This has been a known bug for a long time.

-The middle mouse button quick select sometimes stops switching ammo type and scope when using Q or E. To fix it, you must select an empty loadout (which is locked to 5) and teleport to the infinite ammo gun range. Then, teleport back to your previous location and select your previous loadout. However, this doesn't always work. It occurs about every hour, rendering the new function practically useless. This issue has been reported by the community about 8 months ago and affects all my friends.

-Animals tend to glitch out and stay in place, sometimes becoming unkillable. This has been a long-time known issue occurring 3 to 6 times per session.

-ATVs drive as if they're on ice, displaying poor physics. It seems unlikely they will ever fix this.

-Animal view distance is locked at 400 yards. If you were hoping for long-distance hunting, your only option is mods. Developers actively try to impede mods.

Personal issues with the game and Devs:

-They disdain mods and actively attempt to disrupt the modding community by pushing malicious updates. If only they put as much effort into fixing bugs as they do in thwarting modders. Unofficial patch mods, such as those for the Elder Scrolls Series, could have fixed most of the bugs by now. It appears the devs have ego issues and can't stand others fixing their own failures. Quite disappointing.

-Constantly releasing DLC without fixing the base game is poor form. Maybe they'll release an Official Patch DLC to fix all the mods. I wouldn't be surprised if this idea crossed their mind.

-I'd like more content beyond just hunting exclusives. Make the game more interesting by adding more vehicles, campers, campfires, or even releasing a survivalist DLC (after addressing common bugs, of course).

-Scopes are tinted green and grainy, which is puzzling. Mods can fix this, but they don't always work.

-Birds and many animals don't behave correctly, making the hunting simulation feel blatantly gamey and unrefined.

-I'd appreciate more settings to customize the game.

-Tracking and stealth mechanics feel odd and very gamey.

-They should have integrated their fishing game into this one. Hunting and fishing in the same game would be enjoyable.

The good:
Unfortunately, it's currently the best hunting co-op simulation available. It offers many maps, diverse animals, and continues to be updated with pay-locked content. It's enjoyable, but every session is frustrating in one way or another.",1703884051,1703906004,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Especially the multiplayer CAN get downright broken, especially if some higher ping individuals are involved. New updates release with bugs that are obvious to anyone who plays for 10 minutes. I have no clue how the devs manage to do this little QA.

Despite that...

This is one of my favourite games I played in the last few years. Getting together with some good friends and setting out to kill some of god's creations is a near unrivaled experience. This is definitely not a game for everyone however. 

You need at least two of these:
- be a gun nut
- enjoy nature walks and pretty environments
- enjoy dopamine-detox video games
- have great conversationist friends
- have some disposable income for DLC
- have an above-average tolerance for bugs and general jank

Assuming this suits you, I cannot recommend this game enough. Despite everything it is a stellar experience and I have high hopes that the devs will address the issues as they seem to care quite a bit.

I left a negative Steam review because I found the game boring - as it turns out, the level I picked in Europe was apparently the hardest one in the game, so I did the one in the US and I was actually finding wildlife and able to hunt them successfully. It wasn’t you, it was me. Unfortunately I have already refunded it on Steam, but I am currently playing via Game Pass for PC and I’m having a significantly better time. The only thing I would say is, don’t lead with the quest to take a photo of the red deer. I agree with not having where animals reside on the map to increase the difficulty, but I think that pushes you into the deep end too quickly.

-it shines with the animals and how they are done.  
-nice open world 

and that's where the good things end. 

the bad: 
-RPG elements are underdeveloped a lot 
-crashes with AMD 
-not well optimized, not well polished either 
-itemization is horrible same as the UI 
-game economy fails
-woke morals dictate you can't shoot anything endangered. So deer and rabbit for you all day long in 5 varieties but don't you ask for elephant hunting!
-some DLC are just greedy 
-since they gave progression and economy away the only longterm motivation to play is getting the bigger antlers which means RNG-hunting for legendaries until your brains fall out and that's it - and not even that is for free. The proper lodge to display your legendary kills is a paid DLC, which is outrageous if you think about it how you have to buy the longterm motivation to play as a seperate DLC.
-Directional sound is entirely broken which hurts immersion a lot. 

6/10

Provides a good hunting experience in nice environments if stalking deer is your thing but don't expect anything outside of that. It only reaches the bare minimum of what you'd expect for the price. 
Most of all hurts the bad UI, bad optimazation on AMD and very underdeveloped RPG mechanics imo. 
It's one of those games that is a simulation more than anything and fun is clearly an afterthought. 
It tries to be a hunting simulator and it achieves that for as long as you're not aiming for headshots since the head is no ""vital organ"" in this game. What you get is a product for the niche audience that are already entrenched in the topic. Nothing for a casual player or even RPG-player.

I eventually caved and bought the 4 wheeler DLC but spent probably my first 100 hours without it, maybe more. It does get tedious after a while, but not so much that it made me want to quit the game. You get to see cool scenery and shoot whatever you want so it's fine. There are some glitches and bugs here and there, it's whatever. Love the ability to have trophy rooms and there's a lot of extra DLC content if you want. For paying usually less than $10 per game you get so much bang for your buck without any of the DLC content like guns and dogs. I've played most of the different DLC hunting settings and enjoy the change in scenery and huntable creatures. It is sometimes very annoying and challenging to hunt the small game creatures for achievements or story progression since they're hard to hit and even see, but usually you can pick and choose which quests to keep going and which ones to give up on if you're not having fun.

Its my honest opinion, knowing that more than 50% of the game contents are locked behind DLCs;  all the quads, all the hunting dogs, 90 % of the maps(you only get to play 2 for free), the tents, the ""good"" weapons.. everything i mentioned is only portrayed in the steam page under a ""cute"" showcase banner to attract as much money in as they can, and also all the items i mentioned aren't obtainable UNLESS you SPECIFICALLY ""open that fucking wallet WIDE OPEN""(- probably what their marketing lead said). 
      It's a really empty base game that gets boring after your first 4 hours of walking down to checkpoints(yes, its a running simulator since any other means of transportation other than your feet are PAID!!). 
The base game feels like a free demo, but the jest is that it's NOT FREE AT ALL . But hats off for some good qualities of the game, like the graphics and the lore, even tho unfortunately, as said, the OUTRAGEOUS marketing strategy bathes completely the game in mud. 
      I just hope the developers earn some dignity, by either selling one single product(the base game + all the DLCs) at a higher price point, or, by atleast making a good 90% of the game contents unlockable through some kind of in-game earnable currency.",1703702147,1703702147,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Pros.
- All the reserves look amazing even on low graphics settings.
- Not too hard of a learning curve. Classic easy to learn, hard to master type of game.
- Incredible satisfaction when you down an animal with a perfect shot after stalking it for ages.

Cons.
- Some paid DLC items could have easily just been updates to the game like the blind and hunting stands.
- The story on the Silver ridge peaks reserve doesn't require any hunting, just run from point of interest to point of interest.
- Sometimes the sound of animal calls can be off in terms of direction. Even a few degrees out can send you way off target with your stalking.

When I'm writing this I have about 118h and I got it from a half year back, I don't grind so this is pretty much. Recommended DLCs: Some reserves, I like yukon, then on cuatro carolina you get two free diamonds (misson). Te Aworora is a great reserve for beginners and pros. Weapon Pack DLCs: Modern Rifle Pack, grat startr pack, Zarza 308. covers the most animals (4-8). The other weapons in that pack works fine, but nothing beats Zarza. Smoking Barrels: The second Pack recommended, Muzzeloader with Miller Model 1891. Miller is a fantastic weapon to hunt with, you can hunt all from the greatest animals to the teeny tiny animals. Fire three shots in no time; That's Miller Model 1891. Other recommended DLCs: ATV, soooo useful. A hunting loge of your choice, I like Spring Greek Manor.  Treestands And Tripods, what can i say, kill eight animals instead of four to delete a zone. Bloodhound; How elese do you find your diamond? High Tech Pack; I don't know about you but I prefer to see in the dark!

Tips: Join a discord server to see hotspots (where animals drink). LadyLegend's server is great for everyone that wanna know the fur type rarity and when they drink. Pro XCK's  server is OP for hotspot. When you shot an animal aim a little above the front leg. Watch youtube you can learn a lot from that, but be careful, watch things you learn from and not always it just for fun. Follow my recommendations and you will improve fast.

I'm playing The Angler right now and it's reminding me of a hunting sim I didn't like and I'm pretty sure it was this one. 

It's a very pretty game that goes extremely in-depth with how the animals react to you. Deer will hear you loudly bushwhacking from 200 metres away, so you have to sneak while tracking game. They'll smell you if you're upwind, so you have to try and remain downwind of them while you do so. It's an extremely good hunting simulator that they've put a lot of thought and effort into, and it's absolutely not a game for me. 

If they added realism/difficulty settings to the game, I might give it a solid go, but I just don't want to go slow and steady and spend 20 minutes hunting a single animal.

I'm sure there are some other more technical hunting games out there that are either more realistic, more hardcore or whatever, but this game (The Hunter Call of The Wild) is really the top of the line when it comes to a game that is not only fun but also accessible to wide audiences on multiple platforms, it's casual-friendly, and hardcore in ways if you want it to be.

I thought of it as a no big deal since, surely there's going to be numerous ways on fixing the said problem. But after I tried those ""ways"" the problem didn't fix, rather they did get temporarily ""fixed"" wherein it worked for the first time but after I log out and log back in the problem occurs again. I did everything everyone such as deleting certain files in the avalanche folder (ofc i made a backup file just in case) but nah didn't fix, tried unchecking some DLC's, nope didnt work. Reinstalling the game, nope don't work, updated drivers? nah doesn't matter, try to min max RAM usage, nope doesn't work either. I had added like at least 20 more hrs trying to fix this problem but it doesn't want to be fixed.

Oh yeah here's the kicker as well, when I was trying to fix the problem my original save that had 46 hrs worth of progress disappeared PLUS the fact that this problem has been an re occurring problem since the day this game was released is stupid. So you're telling me all throughout that years of developing this problem wasn't fixed yet?

I wanted to enjoy the game, I really do, and I did have fun, I enjoyed the realistic hunting experience this game provided. But now ever since the problem I had showed up, every session I put into the game is just a waste of time.

So thanks, that first 46 hrs of experience has now become an experience I wanted to experience again but has now became a pipe dream",1703572414,1703588327,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And also a basket for your dog). I also would like to have longer stories since the outer parts of the maps doesn’t get explored if there isen’t a piece of story there. The stories also introduces us to what it would be like to live on those maps, there are cases of animal attacks and other things going on. Now for my final wish: the lack of human or ai/npc interactions. Now some people will say that they don’t need any human interaction, but for some people it may be different.

I come from the point of view of having first played TheHunter Classic. I started playing that game when it first came out and was blown away at the time with the detail. Because at that time it was one of, if not, the best hunting games available. TheHunter Call of the Wild is in my opinion a fresh take on the classic. The maps are great. The animals are decent.  There are some things I like from both games. There are also some things I don't like. Go figure. 
 In general though I think that the team behind this game has done a wonderful job. I know that the AI for the animals could be better. But how many of us playing this game have actually tried to make a realistic animal in a game? I know I haven't. I can imagine that it is not easy and at some point you just have to move on with working on other parts of the game. 
I find it plenty good enough to fend off my hunting cravings. 
Also to put something into perspective. I am one of those people who DOES NOT spend money on games. I find it stupid and honestly a waist of money. I BOUGHT ALMOST ALL OF THE DLCs for this game. I will probably finish buying the rest a bit later. So for if it's good enough to make me spend my hard earned money on. It's at least worth trying out for all your dedicated gamers out there. 
Good job to the developers. I look forward to seeing what comes next.

Many of the maps will get old fast. In locations where you should be able to encounter dozens upon dozens of unique animals, you can only find the short list that they added instead.

The Yukon Valley is one of the most extraordinary places on earth with a goldmine of biodiversity. We could have all kinds of birds, deer, sheep, goats, lynx, bear, and even beavers. Look up Alaskan wildlife if you want to know just how much should be in the game. Instead, the devs added the following: Harlequin Duck, Canada Goose, Red Fox, Gray Wolf, Caribou, Grizzly Bear, and Moose.

For the Yukon Valley of Alaska, they gave us a grand total of... seven animals. Every single map is like this, they are all severely lacking in biodiversity, finishing touches, and story.

Almost every single weapon in the game is broken or bugged in one way or another. Almost across the board iron sights are improperly modeled, sometimes to the point that they will make you unable to properly see your target. DLC content isn't safe from this either, it's like every single gun was modeled by a different person who knew nothing about how to actually aim one. It's a genuine mess and forces you to use a scope which you can't even zero in a way that makes sense.

You will spend hours walking to get from one place to another unless you spend more real money to buy an ATV. It's ridiculous that something so necessary is locked behind a paywall.

I bought most of the DLC, and only then did the game start to feel slightly more complete.

The animals have terrible instincts, but this flaw is much harder to fix because they have to constantly adapt to both the player, the map, and their set schedules so I find it less egregious. All of this will conflict and cause animals that run right to you or fail to run away correctly, allowing for such easy kills that it's like shooting fish in a barrel. It completely removes the challenge as well as the immersion.

My final gripe is less important, but if all else were perfect then I would of course prefer this to be fixed as well. Ballistics aren't realistic at all. Much of this is likely due to balance, but sometimes when you view the path of the bullet into the animal it's just stupid how quickly it stops in the animal. Even a rabbit can stop a .22 like it's Luke Cage after hardly any penetration at all, or a deer can prevent a .243 from reaching its' heart through the front with only a fistfull of fat and hide.

Mistakes are understandable, but the developers have left these problems as they are FOR YEARS. They don't care about the game, and it isn't going to get better.",1703393877,1703393877,False,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

Ekika, it has made the 10-hour hunt easier, I kept buying myself a new tussock because the product in question is advertised as a tussock for long-range shooting. And I wasn't sure about the size of the bullet, nor its specs. Let's get down to business and enjoy this new tussary. Weather doesn't keep a deer upside down. The 3rd deer's head then started to get familiar with the bullet and the game said that Atta's bullet is good for flattening small animals. The expensive tussari is therefore completely useless for the time being. GG.

After all, the game also has a kind of story, which makes you wear your hands while playing. The tasks are simple, but adjusting them takes an hour or so. The progression of the story Osola is slow, but that is not a disadvantage. Since it's a hell of a lot of intensive Sälät perura's edge, it's time to be pretty smart and higly, and then when noise and steps start to come from somewhere. Kumsums worth trying once and for all. ;)

The graphics, well svetneko to even mention.. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. <- Please note the sarcasm.

I would give the seleke a flattering 4.5/5, because the pellisan sättüm is full of bugs. Neither of them are radicals, but sometimes they don't like it.

thank you and goodbye.

It can't match up with the old deer hunter games imo.
Hitboxes for animals are so weird, you can literally shoot something without hitting it, but still get the kill.
I recommend modding the living shiiiiiet out of this game in order to get some enjoyment out of it.

when the necessary abilities are pumped up, hunting becomes easier and more interesting, you no longer rush through the bushes🌳 at breakneck speed to rush a bison or a white-tailed deer🦌, but you wait steadfastly for it to come to you. 
I liked the game. 
💢 Yes, there are bugs in it, animals get stuck, or run cyclically in circles, there were wild boars that rushed around the location like a bullet, but people are eager to fix this crap if possible, for me personally this is not critical. 
🌐There is an online game where you can hunt and drive game together with your friends. Of course, there are not enough birds, I would add ducks, quails, pheasants, etc., 
🔫 Weapons. There are many types of rifles, there are shotguns, a pistol, a crossbow, and a bow. In principle, if not strong critics of hunting, then a very useful game. I recommend it to everyone).

Edit: 1 Great One and 10 Diamonds later my trophy lodge is looking nice, but I have a couple of complaints about the trophy system that would really make trophy hunting much better.

1. More rack variations, it seems like every species racks are almost similar all around, not much variety, you can shoot a silver and gold whitetail with almost identical racks, 1 just looks a little bigger.

2. Trophy lodges should have most spots be able to change wall plaques, I don't hunt enough small game to fill every small plaque in the lodge and I've been out of space for large animals for a while now.

3. Let me attach a nickname to my trophies i.e ""My First Diamond"" or ""Spent 2 hours stalking this guy"" so I can remember why i taxied some of them and put them on the wall.

This game is amazing, anybody who loves hunting would enjoy this, I personally just want to see a better trophy system and it would be a 10/10 for me.

Despite being 6 years old, the game is beautiful, with good graphics, very detailed maps & hunting options & interesting missions. In fact, the game is so beautiful & enjoyable, I mostly just play the game as a hiking simulator, to be out in nature, rather than to hunt. So overall, the game is very well done.

However, the game has a longstanding problem: the developers refuse to add endangered species. This means that players miss out on seeing many iconic animals, like tigers, elephants, & rhinos. 

I want to get the developers' attention & motivate them to better serve we, the players. I know there are many other players who feel the same way I do. IMO, the developers are selling short themselves and the players by not including endangered animals.

Developers, with all due respect, we, the players, pay your salaries & make your work possible. I hope that you'll reconsider your decision to not include endangered animals. The players are demanding it & if you don't serve us, then we'll go to a game that will & you'll suffer the negative consequences, including financial losses.

There are viable workarounds that could address the moral issue of including endangered animals in the game. Please use them. Simply add a disclaimer or warning when the game begins: ""Warning, hunting endangered animals is illegal and immoral. We condemn such behavior..."". Lots of games have disclaimers, like Wreckfest and House Party.

Also developers, you could add the option to toggle hunting endangered animals in the settings. That way, players could choose. As well, maybe make hunting endangered animals conservation missions.

I want to see/hunt a tiger, my favorite animal. I saw some data a few years ago that showed that the tiger was the most popular animal on the planet. And here we have a good game with lots of animals and no tigers? It doesn't make sense to me. Better to serve your customers by adding endangered animals. 

I’m physically disabled, so I’ll likely never get to see a wild tiger in real life. But I could have a similar experience in this game, if endangered animals were added. In short, this game could be the closest I can get to the experience of seeing my favorite animal in the wild. And yet, it’s unavailable because endangered animals are not in the game. Developers, do you see why this issue is important to me? Do you see why the lack of endangered animals in the game is so disappointing? I strongly hope that you’ll reconsider & add endangered animals to the game.

Developers, until you add endangered animals, we're left with a very good game that unfortunately could have been so much more; a game that could have provided me with an experience I’ll never get in real life (seeing a wild tiger) but didn’t.

In conclusion, overall I recommend the game, as long as you don't mind a game that falls short of its potential; a game that's missing many iconic animals.",1696601411,1703072611,True,0,0,0.431444078683853149,1,True,False,False

It takes a long time to walk around and often get bored a little walking and side tracking to look for fun stuff.  You can fast travel to a safe house if you got them unlocked, but that is ONLY once you unlocked it. Which is fine I guess to explore and find the markers. 

There are no vehicles included with the base game, but are now a DLC.  When I bought this game, there was no vehicles and now they have added ATV's (Three different colours) but they are a DLC item... Too which I bought and really makes the game feel more and more like hunting and exploring! This DLC I feel is a must to have!

The game has also adds tents, but this again is a DLC... It does not improve your game as such and can be missed if wanted.

This is a slow paced game, so no run and gun.  Expect to take a long time, going slow (Which is often frustrating for me at times because it feels so slow I need to sprint)

Would I recommend this game? If you are a big fan of hunting games and want something that is going to draw you in and keep you focused and enjoy a slow pace simulation style game then this is the game for you!

I am swinging towards a 78% yes because it is unique and offers a fun amount of hours in the game! It is also multiplayer which is a lot more fun as we know with others.  Just the bugs are slightly annoying right now, limited hunting is a little off putting, otherwise good job!

There's a lot I enjoy about this game, and it feels wrong to vote it down; I LOVE the environments, atmosphere, sound design and attention to detail, but the game itself is an absolute chore to play. This is going to sound like skill issue but I'm not having fun with hunting whatsoever - I'm 15 hours in and have been given little opportunity to learn from my mistakes and grow as a hunter.

The gameplay loop itself is FAR too unforgiving to a new player. I find myself constantly struggling with the controls and losing game because of it (accidentally pressing the wrong number key and having to wait 3 seconds for the character to pull out his bloody binocs before I can tell him to switch to his gun instead while my prey escapes, accidentally pressing the whistle button and scaring all the animals away because some twat thought it was a good idea to bind it next to the prone button, etc.) The fact that you can track an animal for half an hour only to bugger up when trying to take your shot is part of the game I really like because it's realistic to the act of hunting; you don't get second chances, you don't get quicksaves, and that authenticity is something I admire. But in terms of a game where the main draw is hunting, not having better tutorialisation or hell, an easier mode, is completely absurd to me. I KNOW losing hunts is my fault, but when I'm expected to take HOURS to try and get another opportunity to nab something, only to fail yet again from my inexperience, it feels like a gross waste of my time, and I literally learn nothing from it.

If the game had done a better job at introducing the aspect of hunting to me rather than dropping 6000 codex tutorials in one go and saying ""alright, that's all you need to know, you should be a master now"", then I'd be a lot more confident in my abilities. And while I respect that it doesn't hold your hand or baby you, I paid money for this, and I don't have hundreds of hours spare to ""git gud"". Not that I want every animal to freeze in place until I take a shot, mind you, I just want a fairer balance and at the very least more transparency from its mechanics (it literally doesn't properly teach you about bullet travel distances, bullet trajectory, bullet types or tools' radius usage.) It also locks a basic aiming tutorial behind DLC in Revontuli Coast - a far easier map than Hirschfelden, might I add - not to mention a WEALTH of basic quality of life improvements behind DLC too. Hope you like not having cars or tents.

IDK. I know my gameplay is my fault but for the game to not accompany me or help me learn in the slightest really frustrates me. I WANT to love this game but it just refuses to let me in. The menu and UI is dogsh!t and confusing too btw. Incredible sound design, beautifully realised environments, fantastic immersion, but a steep-ass learning curve that demands way too much time and effort from the player without putting in the effort to teach them its mechanics first. The dedication to realism is admirable but it makes actually playing the game and trying to grow an absolute slog.

Skill issue, yeah. But you know whose job it is to teach me how to play?",1702993053,1702993053,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Years now of always the same things in circle;
Overpriced DLC's that introduce bugs that breaks previous working mechanics of the game even if you do not BUY said DLC requiring everyone to download 40 then 50 and now 60+BG DLC/Updates that introduced new game breaking bugs, and then some ""fix"" of some but not all out of those will come much later with the next DLC.

Rinse and repeat.

It's looking less and less like a game and more and more like a money scheme.  

in the last year I could not play the game I already played and owned for over 4 months as game breaking bugs introduced in latest DLC's was preventing me to play and enjoy this game I bought and enjoyed for years before.  

There is a serious issue at management where they obviously push to get DLC's over repairing, fixing and maintaining what great game they already had at the beginning.

What kind of game is it?
☐ Shooter (Although it is a hunter game, there is not alot of shooting, it is important but not constant)
☑ Strategy (You need to sneak up on your prey, use the appropriate items for the appropriate situations, etc)
☐ Fast Gameplay 
☑ Slow Gameplay ( One thing not good about the game is movement, it is slow, so you need to be patient)

How are the Graphics?
☐ Potato ( this is for if it could be ran 10 times on a potato battery PC, so not good)
☐ Bad Graphics
☐ Average Graphics
☐ Good Graphics
☑Amazing Graphics
☐ just real life

What are the specs? (btw they are put in the store page of this game, just scroll down.)
Minimum:
☐ School Laptop 
☑ Cheap PC
☐ Normal Laptop/PC
☐ Gaming Laptop/PC
☐ NASA PC

Recommended:
☐ School Laptop 
☐ Cheap PC
☑ Normal Laptop/PC
☐ Gaming Laptop/PC
☐ NASA PC

Is the price good? 
Before i do the rest, this depends ALOT on what you will buy along with the game, and if you will buy it with a discount or not, or if you buy DLC's along with it, i bought it with a discount, but i will rate it with the normal price

Price:
☐ Free
☐ 0-10 euro's (Only with discounts, i bought it at 3 euro's)
☑10-20 euro's
☐20-30
☐30-60
☐60+

Would i buy it for that price?
☐Yes
☑No
I recommend waiting until you see that it is in discount. I got it for 3 euro's and for that price this is a steal, i would pay up to 10 euro's for this, 

How are bugs?
☑None (or maybe some, but i personally havent encountered one.)
☐Almost none
☐Way too many

The game overal?
It is an amazing strategy game, it is relaxing as it is not a fast gameplay style game, but it goes slowly, you do need patience for it but if you have that, then it is good, there are 2 things that i do not like about the game, that is the movement, as it is WAY too slow, if im running it feels like im just walking a little bit faster, if i crouch i cant move AT ALL and it is annoying as hell, but i bought the vehicle DLC so i dont have to walk 1km for way too long. And then the second reason is the price, i bought it at a discount where the price was 3 euro's, but the normal price is 20 euro's, so i recommend going ahead and waiting till the game is in discount.",1702949441,1702949735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

theHunter Call Of The Wild is a interesting, realistic, and immersive, thrilling experience, I personally didn't enjoy this game because it takes forever to actually get a animal, you have to sit there and wait for the animals, it's a very realistic game, it's pretty similar to real life, but it really wasn't for me. 

I'm sure the developers have put much work into this game to get it the way it is and I'm impressed with the beautiful landscape and the immersive feeling, but overall It takes a lot of patience and I don't have much patience, I don't really know what I was thinking but I thought it would be different than the way it is, it's still a cool game for those who enjoy hunting and for those that have patience.


[b]Downsides:[/b]

It takes a ton of patience and when you are somebody that doesn't have much patience for these type of things it gets hard to enjoy the game for what it is, because I could go outside and hunt and I don't think there would be much of a difference compared to this game.

The original game released years ago but rather than pump out full priced sequels there is a steady diet of micro DLC and constant fixes and tweaks by the devs. Base game gear and maps are already varied and offer plenty of game play. There is no requirement for any of the DLC, and it is packaged in bite sized bits to allow players to mix and match whatever catches their fancy. 
DLC itself can break the base game progression a bit. The game gates off equipment behind levels and huge sums of money for new guns and gear. DLC gear appears for free in the store, meaning that you can simply ignore the game's intent of gating your progression. This is fine since it's not really a relevant part of the experience. 
Graphically this game is jaw dropping. Up close vegetation loses it's 3-D but zooming back to look at the landscape as a whole is like looking at a postcard. Lighting effects are astounding and a light morning fog with the low hanging sun sending rays of light look like it belongs in a Nat Geo documentary. Even the full moon gets enormous detail despite the accelerated time in game making it rush across the sky. There is an in-game camera and one could absolutely use this as a nature photography simulator without ever killing an animal. Sound is likewise very good, although I suggest headphones as the non-hunters in your house will probably not appreciate the sound of a dying rabbit blaring out of a bedroom. 
This is a sim, not so much a 'game'. There are story missions and trophy scoring systems, but there is no 'win' or 'lose' in COTW. It is in your best interest to hunt ethically and take well aimed shots not only for better scoring but more to save the half hour or so tracking down a barely wounded animal. This is an extremely SLOW title that will see you creeping along at a snail's pace for long stalks. And like real life sometimes spend all that time and still spook off your prey without getting to take a shot. If you require immediate gratification, this is not your game. If you are willing to invest significant amounts of time to get perhaps a single shot on a trophy, willing to let a dozen lesser beasts walk by to hopefully see the big boy- then COTW is your game. 
Hunting types are well represented including rifles, handguns, bows, and shotguns. Additionally shotguns can be loaded with buckshot and slugs for big game. Bows come in traditional, recurve, and compound as well as a crossbow. DLC can expand hunting hours to take full advantage of the 24hour day/night cycle in COTW by adding night vision. 
More than just weapon types, COTW lets you to spot and stalk, or set up treestands and tripods. Waterfowling is completely different than big game hunting and turkey hunting is it's own challenge. There is tremendous variety to be had and given the slow pace of the game- you can keep things fresh easily. 
Animals follow a realistic daily migration going from resting zones to feeding to drinking at specific times. The player can find these locations and pick a time where game can be expected. However over-hunting an area will erase these zones and they respawn randomly elsewhere requiring finding again- so controlling hunting pressure is a key part of successfully harvesting trophy animals. It's relatively easy to just walk around and stumble across game, but careful scouting to find the best among the herd will eventually lead to better spawns overall. 
The game's economy is fairly brutal without DLC adding items to the shop for free. Ammo can cost more than $1000 for ten rounds and guns and gear like treestands and waterfowl blinds cost tens of thousands of dollars each. COTW needs to knock a zero off their economy to reflect something remotely close to reality. 
There is a leveling system with skills and perk trees. Perks are broken down to weapon types but often affect all weapon types which is a bit obtuse. For example a perk to reduce recoil is found in the shotgun perk tree but affects all weapon types equally. 
Including DLC, there is plenty here for gun and hunting nerds. Maps and exotic species around the world, a range of gun types and calibers, various technologies and hunting techniques leave the player spoiled for choice. Much like real life, there can be real little practical difference between things like rifle calibers, making for a bit of an illusion of choice. Essentially the .308, 7mm, 30-06, 7.62mm and 270 win rifles are functionally identical. But gun nerds will argue endlessly which is the 'best' of the bunch so the game gives you the option.  
Animals react realistically with gunshots sending everyone bolting immediately while bow shots may allow for follow up or missed shots to not spook the herd. Wind direction, the use of cover scent or attractants will affect how close animals will come before spooking. COTW does sacrifice the realism of bag limits or specific game licenses for the sake of being more entertaining. You can hunt any animal day or night, shoot birds on the water, or simply blast an entire herd of something rather than the usual single big game animal most licenses allow. There are no off limits animals in COTW, if you can 'spot' it then you can blast it legally. 
COTW can be a relaxing walking simulator, camping simulator, photography sim, target shooting sim, and of course actual hunting sim. You could simply host a multi-player camping trip with friends with COTW. Go ride ATVs together. COTW provides huge open maps and lets you just wander around them. 
The hunting might be optional but it's very good. As a life long hunter in real life, this is about as close as it gets from a chair. I use the same tactics and approach maps the same as in real life. That is high praise for a hunting sim. The devs did an excellent job of recreating real life hunting in a video game, but with the benefit of not having to pull ticks off after hunting in New England.",1576252077,1702839817,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

From a real hunter who has been stuck indoors lately this game is amazing and gives you the real feel of hunting minus all the real life problems like eating, drinking,exercising
Love this game even if you don't Hunt, the game is beautiful and the ambient sounds and visuals make the game extremely peaceful. The Hunting is very tedious but at the same time so rewarding.
-Hunting turkey with a .50 cal muzzle loader (musket) 10/10
-Getting gored by bores while friends scream 10/10
-Stalking a deer through the woods for a hour only for my tracking dog to scare it away 10/10
-Being charged by a bison and frantically unloading my .465 magnum to put it down 10/10
-Waiting by a lake to blast some ducks and having a laugh with your friends 10/10

Would like to see more of the other locations be opened up, and not under a pay-wall, but I can see why they do it, because they have put a lot of effort into this game into making it more than just an arcade hunting game. 

Is this the best at learning proper hunting skills, NO. Is it a good hunting simulator with realism, yes if you are coming from hunting games like Hunting Unlimited.

lets start from the beginning of what would be your experience in this game. the ui is pretty straightforward. you can start a new game, continue your save, hop on multiplayer, change your settings, select a reserve, buy dlcs and leave the game. everyone starts by changing their settings, so let’s talk about that first. you can adjust quite a few things in this game, the visuals, the gameplay, the interface, the audio, hell you can even change your red dot sight reticle. and yet the settings are simple and every setting comes with a brief explanation of what it is. 

start a new game, and you’ll find yourself in the very first reserve of the two you have access to as a new player, layton lakes or hirschfelden. i recommend you start on layton lakes since hirschfelden is quite challenging to hunt on. upon spawning in, you’ll find yourself in the coast of a pretty big map, and yatsume that point you cant help but notice the graphics. 

the graphics in this game are amazing, and the maps are beautifully crafted too. every reserve in the game is based on a real life region, although they’re not existing reserves. one thing that may surprise you (it definitely surprised me) is the optimization. my computer isn’t exactly amazing (i have an almost 4 years old 1050 ti, 16gb of ram, and a i7-4770 cpu) and yet the game ran very well even on the highest graphic setting. this is in big part thanks to what i think is an awesome feature of the game, AMD FSR. it improves the games frames a fucking ton while making the image still perfectly fine. after looking around a bit you may notice a deer in front of you. this is the tutorial deer, and trust me, the animals won’t be this easy to find.

the animal models look amazing on most species. i do wish they reworked the jackals, for example, but that’s just an exception. animals in this game come with many different fur/plumage/scale types which adds to the variety of what you could find. one really cool thing about this game is that the animals that are on your map will always be on it until you kill them, and they’ll respawn as an animal of the same species and same sex. for example, if you kill a female whitetail deer a female whitetail deer will respawn. you take aim at the deer and you’re supposed to aim for the animals vital organs, but the tutorial doesn’t tell you where the lungs are (behind the front shoulder blade of the animal). so a lot of people just shoot the deer’s head out of fps experience, and the deer runs off. stuff like the rifle shot and the bolting has really good animation and sound behind it. the animations that this game has for the animals are really nice and very realistic. you’ll find a bunch of bugs regarding them every now and then but more than ruining the experience it’s pretty funny to see. 

tracking in this game is very simplified compared to real life. tracks and blood trails are very highlighted and easy to see, as well as the animal’s corpse. once you confirm your trophy you get to the harvest menu, which tells you the animals fur type, trophy score, medal of the animal and each shot you took at it before it died. you can toggle x rays vision to see the animal’s anatomy in this screen and it’s pretty accurate to real life anatomy. the trophy score will determine a rating: none, bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. there’s a special rating, the great one, which is incredibly rare to find and doesn’t depend on trophy score. for those that do depend on it, each species has a different amount of minimum score to get to that medal. the medal can go down by one level if you mess up what’s known as the harvest check: using proper ammo for the animal, shooting the animal less than two times, ruining the animal’s trophy organ (99% of the time it’s their skull) and hitting a vital organ, which can be the brain, heart, lungs and liver. when hunting ducks and rabbits there’s no need to hit vital organs however. 

this game requires a lot of patience once you’re done with the tutorial and hunting some animals. if you keep running thinking the animals are stupid, you’ll just make them all flee. if you’re not careful, this game can be quite frustrating to play, but when you do get rewards like some diamond trophies it feels amazing. speaking of trophies, you can taxidermy these trophies and exhibit them at one of three trophy lodges, two of which are locked behind dlc. there are a lot of weapons in this game: rifles, bows, shotguns, handguns, even a goddamn muzzleloader. however, 90% of these are locked behind dlc. there are lots of reserves, but only two come with the base game. some awesome utilities like tents that allow you to fast travel anywhere you place them or tripods that give you an elevated position, keep you concealed, etc. that are locked behind dlc. there’s a dog that can help you track animals by smelling their blood that is locked behind dlc. you may be noticing a pattern here. 

yeah this game has a ton of content locked behind dlcs. it’s nice that they go on sale often but it’s kind of ridiculous. 

the game seems to crash a lot. this isn’t just me, it’s a lot of people that are having this problem. it’s not too annoying but it can definitely fuck you over sometimes.

i mentioned multiplayer earlier. it’s really cool that you can play in maps you dont own in multiplayer, but there’s quite a few issues with it: lag, modders, etc. 

overall you should absolutely pick this game up if it’s on sale, and may as well pick a few dlcs with it. i managed to get a solid combo during black friday for 20€, which is the usual price for just the base game.",1702739786,1702739786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be quik about it, over time they have fixed most of the real issues. Not happy with the online stuff but at the same time not unhappy either as it turned out to be more of a nothingburger. For more info on that read all the old review stuff below. The game is also still a little ""stick it to ya"" with the DLCs but its not too bad. The reserves themselves are worth the money. Its the rest of the DLCs that are questionable. BUt as far as game play goes, its a decent solid, good looking game without too many issues. It is by far the best hunting game out there including the most recent addition which I will leave unnamed since I am changing this review to a thumbs up.

For old review read below. So I like to keep up on this game, even go shoot something occasionally. Thought I would update my review. Basically nothing below really has changed much and things have gotten worse. So they slowly started introducing or migrating over to an online gaming system. No one is happy about this. And today, the day before April Fools day, they force everyone on steam to download a 24gb in store dlc. So it is really apparent where this game is heading, basically a privately owned version of their classic online game, but in the worse way possible. They talked up the online thing as if it was going to make the gaming better with competitive missions or competitions. Then the very next thing they do is an in game dlc store. I think the writing is on the wall on where they are going with this. Dont buy unless you are willing to put up with all the flaws and coming soon to a monitor near you, the money train-drain.
-----------------------------------------------------
There needs to be a ""MEH"" catagory to the rating.

Graphics ok, but some ""glitches"".
Sound is ok but some ""glitches""
AI is well not really ok, but improving.

Basically if you are into playing this in single player and you don't mind animals all looking identical within a species. Then I would recondmend it as it is an ok hunting platform at the price point and with additional DLC's (see below) buying the ones you like, I would then recommend this game.

If you want to play this game with friends I would advise you and friends get the hunter ""classic"" MP game with a year subscription. You will be VASTLY happier in what you can do MP wise with creating hunts ect than what you can do currently in this title. And I don't think they are intent on making the MP of this game better or more like thier ""classic"" title.

DLC's and the future: As just noted, I don't think they intend to improve the MP aspect of this game much. At least nowhere near what they should and no where near the ""classic"" version of this game.
Other than that , expect a plethora of .99 to 4.99 DLC content. They started with the tent/blind DLC and it will go on. Birds, other animals , more weapons will all be added and it looks like at a piecemeal price point (items sold individually) which is good for those that want to pick and choose what they hunt and hunt with. But I am sure there are folks who will want and may get bundles.

Since I bought this specifically to play MP and my grading is two different grades I have to go with my MP score/reason. And just cannot recommend this title.",1493316122,1702676260,True,0,0,0.493630588054656982,0,True,False,False

The hunting experience of the game is a joke too, most of it just boils down to sprinting around everywhere with my ar-15 getting withing 200yd and just blasting as many deer as i can in order to get higher level deer to spawn, and because the AI is so borked they dont even care im shooting at them and will eventually walk back to that same spot were i shot them 3 minutes later. and alot of the time  higher level deer like ""diamonds"" spawn and sometimes they will just run out of bounds de-spawning themselves or just not allowing you to get them, rarely if you kill an taxidermy animals they just wont count as trophy's and wont be mountable but ive had this happen, sill gun and arrow physics are pretty fun like for instance my 450gr broadhead being able to travel through an entire cape buffalo length wise lmao

overall the lighting and weather of the game is what sells it but the overall graphics are a 6/10 but there not nearly as bad as say a game like the hunter classic, but for a game that came out in 2017 is expect better. and the story is terribly boring, you play as a no name hunter came to get as many diamond trophies as you can and overall the game is just chasing dialouge no real events, the most fun story i played was the ""vurhonga savannah"" cause i thought the characters *even though you never see faces* were interesting


Overall if you want to play a hunting game that has good hunting mechanics and good animal behavior AI, aswell as a wide variety of the most commonly used hunting calibers and an experience with good graphics aswell as story. there are better options that dont cost nearly as much money as buying this game and all its DLC. i recommend ""way of the hunter"" its a 8/10 experience in my opinion that is simply superior to the experience i had in the hunter COTW. this games trophy hunting and animal slaughtering with my friends will always hold a special place in my heart

But I cannot really fully recommend this due to major issues with the audio. The spatialisation is just busted, the direction which you hear stuff is frequently completely wrong, sometimes 180 degrees wrong. In a game with otherwise very nice sound design and foley this is a huge shame and it causes real problems in gameplay. The game does have a visual indicator thing that shows where sounds are coming from, and this is basically essential otherwise you would end up looking in the wrong direction when you hear an animal. It's especially annoying with the dog's barking when they're tracking an animal, I generally have to bring up the GPS map thing to see where he actually is.

It seems like these this issue with audio spatialisation has been reported for many years now and it hasn't been fixed, this really isn't great.

It's mostly solid otherwise though one bug that keeps happening for me is the weapon and all gear seemingly disappearing from my hands when I make certain inputs in fast sequence, and I have to go into the inventory to unequip/equip to bring it all back so I can use a gun etc. If this happens at a critical moment as an animal is passing by it kind of kills my enthusiasm for the game tbh.

Hopefully this stuff gets sorted sooner rather than later because I really like the game and would like to play more.",1702626848,1702626848,False,32,7,0.65675055980682373,5,True,False,False

I wanted to update my review. Notably, I still recommend the game if you are interested in a hunting simulator. I would, however, advise abstaining from the majority of the DLC that has been released outside of maps really. I have almost all DLC and they just dropped another collection of 5 or 6 ""purely cosmetic"" DLCs at $2,99USD a piece. The game just isn't worth the amount of money they charge for it anymore. Buy it on sale, get the maps, maybe a gun pack that you like, but otherwise it is an Arcade hunting game mostly.

I'm sure their competition will fall into the same boat as CotW has, but this DLC abuse has turned me away from the product now. I choose to play their biggest competitor as it is a more accurate simulation and currently has a much more reasonable price tag for new players interested in a challenging simulation.

TLDR; I still recommend the game, but don't waste your money on any of the cash grab DLCs that add zero to the game. There is no point in cosmetics for things you don't actually see in the game 99% of the time. Make educated financial decisions.

--- Original Jul 21, 2022---
I'm a huge fan of challenging zen type simulations. CotW definitely scratches that itch. Beautiful reservations, excellent modeling, and the ability to play at the pace you choose. I've been playing since 2017, but I'll assure you that the price for all of the DLC is worth it, more so if you can catch it on sale.

Call of the Wild, where the hunter arrives.
With rifle in hand and a keen eye to see,
A realm of challenge and pure strategy.

Through dense forests and plains so wide,
Tracks to follow, nowhere to hide.
From majestic elk to the stealthy boar,
Hunting's allure, a passionate roar.

The sun-kissed dawn, the evening's hush,
The thrill of the chase, a hunter's rush.
Each habitat teems with life untamed,
In this game, where skills are acclaimed.

Immersed in realism, a hunter's dream,
Sublime landscapes in a digital stream.
Behold the wilderness, so vividly rendered,
A world to explore, so finely contended.

From rifle to bow, a hunter's array,
A plethora of gear, to seize the day.
And in this realm, where nature's styled,
The Call of the Wild, earns its rightful smiled.

A score of nine, a hunter's delight,
For this game captures nature just right.
An ode to the chase, a review that's bold,
In Call of the Wild, adventures unfold.

So, heed the call of this digital spree,
In the world of hunting, where wild runs free.

The audio in this game has been a problem since day one and the devs have done nothing to fix it. They just ignore it and act like it doesn’t exist. I remember asking them about it on a live stream in 2017 and they kicked me out right away. Six years later, it’s still a mess. I played the game again after a long time and it was so obvious that the audio was broken.

I hunted an animal and let the dog track it down. I was standing a few meters away from the dog and I turned 90 degrees to the left or right. The dog would be on my left side, but I would hear it from the right side, and vice versa. It’s not my sound setup, I checked the Windows audio test and made sure the left and right channels were correct.

I tried this on three other machines, including a Steam deck, and the same problem was there. I used different headphones and speakers, like Airpods, Sennheiser HD280s, Sennheiser PXC550, some old Skullcandy headset, and my Studio Edifier monitors.

There is no doubt that the sound engine is still faulty. You will hear animals as if they are right next to you, but they are actually far away. You will hear footsteps that you think are on your left side, but they are actually on your right side, and you will scare away the animal when you look.

The devs will not fix it, they don’t admit that it’s an issue, and I’m sure that it’s too hard for them to fix because of their lacklustre development skills. The game is seven years old and it still can’t run on high or ultra settings and get more than 100 fps on a 3090 TI. That shows that they only care about making new content and fixing minor bugs.

Update (April 2022)
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
Even when it's on sale, why?
Developers do NOT listen, they add useless updates that just wastes space and cater to the Console version. They DO NOT FIX BUGS, MAJOR GAME BREAKING BUGS.

DLC keeps getting priority over bugs that are FIVE YEARS OLD STILL!
Now they have added an INTERNAL DLC STORE that is 18Gigs, which provides ZERO benefit for Steam Customers, PROVING where their interests are content over quality.

If you decide to ignore this and BUY the game, you will 90% have a chance of crashing after you waited HOURS for your massive download. YES you download DLC that you do NOT OWN to inflate your game folder. The devs do NOT care.

Look at the REPLY from the devs below from 2 years ago. They said ""several of those bugs should be addressed now"" IT'S A LIE! Almost ALL of those BUGS are still there and haven't been fixed in FIVE YEARS!

Dev below: "" i might not fully agree to your statement about DLC since the team working on bugs not necessarily work on expansions and vice verca.""

THAT IS BULLSHAAIT! If that was true, BIG fixes would have come down WITH DLC, but all that is being released is MORE DLC and ZERO BUG FIXES!

AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!

Update from March 2022
More bugs, more ""what is a QA team?""
Now the map has NO POI at all, I can't fast travel or see ANY need zones
The graphics performance have dropped significantly and the FSR implementation is so bad.
Most software companies have a QA team and don't use their paying customers as testers
POI icons option FOR BOTH MAP AND WORLD... how STUPID is this setting. Never in the life of gaming have I seen such a stupid ignorance towards gamers.
You turn POI OFF, then it's off both on MAP and WORLD. And the POI Icons are SO DAMN MASSIVE that it can take up all the HUD and completely ruin the experience. HOW did this get past ANY FORMS of testing. I have NEVER in my LIFE seen such stupidity before. 
If this isn't proof of GREED over quality, I don't know WHAT is...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Below is my original review, which I would have removed, but I still don't recommend this game and my opinion stands. DLC is of higher priority than bugs and other issues. The map issues have been removed, which is a better experience. But wow is there still a lot of issues present. One complete game breaker is how the audio completely falls over itself. I just hear my own footsteps and anything in like a 5 meter radius from me. I have to restart the game to fix it. Animals can still teleport vast distances, now to even more impossible locations. I'm sad that I have to now just uninstall it and not bother to try again, Avalanche got my money, I guess that matters more... at least people can get it on sale now and not lose too much if they are willing to take a chance on this game. ah well 🤷‍♂️

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I was an early bird to this game, and bought it in the first week.
Played it for many hours as  you can see, but there was so many bugs from the beginning and the game was costly at the time.  

After nearly 3 years now, this game still has the same bugs:
-Opening the map is slow as hell. How can they STILL not fix this?!?!
-The map loads POI's, Needzones, etc slower than Google Maps on an smoke signal network...
-The Map NEVER remembers the last position it was closed at.
-Map mission zones needs ""movement"" to display (zoom or move map).
-Maps on Multiplayer take nearly 3 seconds to open....WTF>?!?
-Animals still teleport vast distances or through mountains.
-Animals still do the Moonwalk against a tree non-stop
-Animal transitions are still janky as hell and has never been smooth
-Binoculars opened and then fast travelling STILL keeps the binocular HUD on screen.

There is so many more bugs, and they JUST DON'T get fixed...
I buy every DLC, and hope the added patch would fix issues, but Expansive worlds are pretending now that they are like EA, and don't give a 💩, and rather push out content, instead of squashing bugs.

I felt especially frustrated now, because they add more and more bugs with their features, which costs me Diamonds and this game already cost so much in patience. 

The developers just ignore the playerbase and continues pushing out features, and ignores fixes.

I'm done, I recommend NOT buying this game, even patient people will get impatient with this mess now...",1557706745,1702253805,False,29,7,0.581041991710662842,0,True,False,False

I opened the game a couple of months ago and found that I could not get a playable frame rate and good-enough graphics at the same time, which was weird, because I did not have any problems before, so I forgot about the game again for a while. I now have the Steam Deck OLED, which has slightly better all round performance, and find that the situation has not changed.

When I used to play, I tried to do so as ""authentically"" as possible - no HUD, no glowing tracks etc, no assists, no ATV (which are all cheating), and limited fast travel, and I had a great time. I finished the entirety of Yukon Valley, maybe half of all Rancho content, maybe half of Cuatro Colinas content, and bits of other maps, using 3 weapons packs, the bloodhound, and the tents DLC. I never got around to playing the Medved DLC that I bought, but I may do so if the game runs better some day.

The game nails the atmosphere of certain locations, though not necessarily on every part of each map, and not in all weathers. I have spent a lot of time in Spain in real life, and Quatro Colinas has areas and views that are distinctly evocative of parts of Spain.

It is annoying that you have to download the entire new DLC map when one is released, whether you will buy it or not, which really eats away memory card space (about 10GB per map, which is not nothing). The justification is that you can play all maps for free on other peoples' servers, but I would rather have the 50GB+ of disk space from the 5+ maps that don’t interest me at all.

The “plot” of each area is mostly just ways to try to justify gunning down the various species in the name of “conservation” or “population control”; in reality, the best technique is to re-establish top predators (typically having been wiped out by hunting), not to kill them. And the other kind of mission story tends to be improving facilities for the rich hunters who pay to hunt in the area, though you never see them.

Notably, the free trophy lodge that they added a few months ago is absolutely atrocious, apart from the view. I wish I could get a refund for it. I just thought I'd mention that.
The African trophy lodge is OK but I would wait until you have a good number of actually-worth-displaying trophies before paying for a trophy lodge, or you will end up with mostly-empty rooms.

It's obviously not a perfect simulation, but it's a good tracking and shooting game, and a great price when on sale. Now fix it for the Steam Deck please!",1702044947,1702044947,True,16,5,0.637650549411773682,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Massive Maps
amazing graphics
great selection of gear and guns

Cons:
all add on's are DLC(somethings like tree stands and such should have been part of the base game)
weather is not realistic(rains almost none stop, ever 20 minutes)
cost of new gear and guns(no one is gonna pay $440 in real life for 10 rounds of 270win)

Overall:
5 stars
game needs work in a few key areas, such as effective range of weapons...a 270win can take down large game much father then 165 yards i know cause i own one and have done it.
and the level system and missions need to go, just make it a hunting sim.

Edit:
this game still needs work, the Pheasant for example are almost impossible to hunt you can't even get close enough to shot one before it runs off, IRL i have stepped on this little buggers hunting them, they are more likely to flush or hide then run. must have model them off farm raised stocked ones not wild.",1577870601,1701930372,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First and foremost! This game is not for everyone. I love it because guns and hunting are 2 thing I enjoy conceptually and I love the slow pace of this game. If that doesn't sound like something you can enjoy, this game probably won't peak your interests.

This has a lot to love. The story (although sometimes drawn out) is oddly cozy and warm feeling with the wardens of each reserve providing a great window into the history of the places you hunt in. I found myself really looking forward to completing missions to hear what the Warden had to say to me next and what hunt was next on the agenda and that's about as much praise as I can give any story.

The game play is smooth and very satisfying. All of the guns sound amazing and impactful with recoil that really gives a punch to every shot. The animal behaviour although a tad basic, does the job of fooling you into believing that you are hunting an animal, not just an AI. All animals have different levels of hearing, sight, and smell which changes how you need to approach certain hunts. And I can't not mention the visuals. The game is demanding on hardware but beautiful to look on every single reserve.

Some cons of the game: max view distance is only 400M so no REALLY long range shots but the game is designed in such a way that you don't really want more than that distance anyway. Animals can become very predictable after some time. The game has A LOT of paid DLC which can turn people off it. I will defend that though as although I hate paid DLC's, every DLC I have bought has felt well worth the price.

Tip if you are planning on getting the game: make sure you have the ATV DLC and the tents DLC. They will make life a hell of a lot easier for you.

In conclusion: I love this game. I really think this is 1 of if not THE best hunting experience you can have in a video game. I've played it for hundreds of hours and I'll play it for hundreds more. I hope you find the same enjoyment I did.",1539093538,1701903531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, what I find challenging is the user interface, especially for beginners like myself. Accessing certain menus, such as buying items, managing storage, navigating to the inventory, and configuring equipment, can be cumbersome. One aspect I find frustrating is the process of setting up items in the inventory.

Regarding the DLC for dogs, it would be beneficial to have an option for the dog to follow by simply right-clicking. This feature could greatly enhance the overall experience. Another issue I encountered is when playing multiplayer with friends. Sometimes, my friends want to mark a point on the map, and it would be helpful if there were a cooperative mode or a feature that allows everyone to see each other's marks. The current method of marking spots can be challenging, as the mark occasionally goes far away, and the arrow effect seems subpar. Additionally, inviting players doesn't seamlessly integrate into the game.

On a positive note, I appreciate the extensive information provided about animals and the game's environmental effects, such as weather changes and time progression. The diverse scenarios and areas, along with the well-designed maps, make the game captivating, and I can easily spend hours immersed in it.

One suggestion for improvement would be to diversify the blood trails, as they currently appear repetitive. Despite these issues, I believe it's a fantastic game that I would recommend.

My son is three years old, and we've been trying to potty train him for a while now. Unfortunately, we've hit a major roadblock - his fear of the ""skibidi toilet"" You might be wondering what a ""skibidi toilet"" is, and honestly, I had no idea either until we encountered it. Fron what I've gathered, ""skibidi toilet"" is basically a new genre of youtube video about evil singing toilets. Basically think zombies but instead they're toilets that sing in your face. I was fine to let my son watch the videos at first, as they seemed innocent enough and fairly harmless, but they soon devolved into strange post apocalyptic material with grotesque toilets fighting in a war against mankind, so I finally intervened and cut him off. I thought that was the end of it, he can't watch the videos anymore so theres nothing to be afraid of. Well, I was wrong. This has since turned into a complete nightmare for us at home. We recently started potty training and he refuses to use the toilet now due to skibidi toilet. Whenever we try to put him on it he screams and refuses to go anywhere near it. We've tried explaining that skibidi toilet isnt real and our toilet is completely safe, but it seems like it's too overwhelming for him. We even let him decorate it with stickers, hoping it would make him less afraid, but no luck so far. It utterly breaks my heart to see him so anxious about such a simple thing that every child goes through. I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Should we give him more time and hope that he warms to the toilet, or is it better to try a completely different approach? I know every child is different, but has anyone else experienced something similar?

1st complaint is that alot of the DLC is lame. The ATV is absolutely necessary unless you want to spend a thousand hours travelling the maps. 

Another thing to be aware of is the only weapon customization are the scopes and ammo. For shooting small animals like ducks and rabbits you need a class 1 specific ammo which takes about 50 hours killing stuff to level up your weapon level to be able to purchase this ammo. As for the different scopes you need to spend 50 hours leveling up your weapons to be able to purchase the different scopes as well. 

Not a huge deal, but I shot one of the birds in the game and it gave me the animation of it falling but it just disappears. There is no harvest for it. 

Besides the time dedication for the different perks, scopes, and other equipment. So far the game has been pretty fun. If the above complaints don't bother you then Buy this game. Be a man.",1649558775,1701711761,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of animals. However, setting up for a kill is taking way too much time and they always seem to flee when you are not even near. I guess maybe with two players it would be easier to strategise this.

Get it on sale. Lots of stuff is needlessly put behind DLC and price tags such as:
-dogs. A super good way of tracking things that you are having trouble with, and can even give warning signs that you are about to lose a hunt.
-vehicles. This one speaks for itself, there are no free vehicles outside of dlc
-prices. Dlc items are priced in game at.... Free? I mean.. I guess thats cool, but I'm surprised we dont have to earn anything in them? Kinda a double edged sword of putting a price tag on everything, but also getting them for free when you buy the dlc?

Now, I've had save files break when modding games like skyrim, but if your game is imfamous for spontaneously breaking peoples save files by just playing the standalone game with a few DLCs, then your game does not work.

Ingredients:
- 500 g beef
- 500 g pork
- 20 g curing salt (nitrite curing salt)
- 5 g coarse ground pepper
- 5 g sweet paprika
- 3 g garlic powder
- 2 g ginger powder
- 2 g dried marjoram
- 1 g ground coriander
- 1 g grated nutmeg
- 1 g ground cardamom
- Pork casings for stuffing
- Kitchen twine

Instructions:
1. Cut the beef and pork into small pieces and pass them through a meat grinder with a coarse plate.
2. Place the ground meat in a large bowl and add all the spices (curing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ginger powder, marjoram, coriander, nutmeg, and cardamom). Mix well until the spices are evenly distributed.
3. Cover the meat mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
4. Thoroughly clean the pork casings and soak them in cold water to soften.
5. Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator and knead it again to ensure proper blending.
6. Stuff the meat mixture into the prepared pork casings, ensuring there are no air pockets and that the casings are evenly filled.
7. Cut the filled casings into approximately 10 cm long pieces and tie the ends with kitchen twine.
8. Hang the Landjäger sausages in a cool place to dry for about 2-3 weeks. The ideal temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius.
9. After the drying period, the Landjäger sausages are ready to be consumed. They can be enjoyed raw or lightly pan-fried.

Note: When making sausage, it is important to maintain proper hygiene. Ensure all utensils are thoroughly cleaned, and use fresh meat. It is also recommended to familiarize yourself with basic sausage-making principles and consider employing specific sausage-making techniques.

Die Kritik das viel Spielspaß hinter DLC verborgen ist, ist leider wahr. Erst mit einer Auswahl von Zusätzen ist es für mich zu einem guten Spiel geworden (Nachtsicht, Hund, Quad, diverse Waffen). In Zeiten von Rabatt Aktionen ist der Preis aber mehr als OK. 
Das man im Multiplayer nicht an den Missionen zusammen arbeiten kann ist schade. Aber wohl der Balancierung geschuldet. Die Grafik ist trotz dem Alters des Spiels einfach toll.
Die Frage ob es eher simulation oder Spiel ist würde ich so beantworten: Eher eine Simulation, wer hier action erwartet ist falsch am Platz....musste ich beim ersten Durchgang hart erlernen (kein Rocketjump möglich und wer auch nur schnell läuft bekommt in der Regel nur fliehende Tiere zu sehen...wenn überhaupt)

It can be quite challenging starting out and even once you have experience certain animals are still difficult to get close enough to down. A game worth playing is one that remains challenging in my opinion. I don't particularly care for the boat-load of weapons available but different weapons do provide a different challenge level if you want to push yourself further. The animals can also be a bit buggy at times, allowing for some easy mass slaughtering if you come across a situation like I did where there was a section of river all the animals were frozen on. Even once shot the animals just stood there until they died. I enjoy the fact that you have to be patient and wait for a good shot otherwise you may lose the animal entirely or have to chase it halfway across the map, not a fun thing to do trust me :D. Not all animals react like this, pigs for instance are spot on. They often very quickly return to an area or stop running a lot faster then other species. In real life this is exactly the way they are, they return to a feed spot even if one of their group is freshly killed on the ground. I really like the tracking dog even though he bugs out sometimes. There is a lot to like about this game and very few inconveniences in my opinion. I highly recommend playing with a friend!

What I got: 
- Fly higher than SpaceX by ramming into my friend with the 4X4 and get thrown into space.
- Cruising through the savanna and literally die because a water buffalo  came running through the tall grass and ran me over.
- Spend hours and hours to get a Great One fallow deer, and in the process got some nice albino, melanistic and piebald fallow deer.
- Try to get a diamond tier Banteng in Emerald Coast map but because of lack of patience I shoot it from 350m away, miss his vital organs and thus ruining the diamond ranking.
- Get killed by a group of wolves in Medved Taiga, my friend kills all of them and instantly becomes rich.
- Run after bunnies in Te Awaroa, literally killed the whole population by blasting them all with my shotgun, ended up with a nice albino European Rabbit.
-Join multiplayer hosted maps to steal their diamond ranked goat.
- Get diamond ranked Mule Deer stolen by flying cheater that comes in faster than a F16 jet.

11/10 game, perfect for if you are watching a video/stream and have a second monitor. So many weapons/maps/animals that it creates endless possibilities. The start might be hard since you have nothing, but exploring and discovering everything like diamonds, super rare fur types and the Great One animals makes this game amazing.",1701073959,1701073959,True,119,37,0.875418901443481445,0,True,False,False

From tracking, using lures, utilizing the terrain to your advantage to sneak up on animals, to finally getting into position setting up the chance to take that perfect shot. It is an incredible experience, especially when all that work pays off and you drop the animal you were stalking in one shot.

Breathtaking scenery and visuals help draw you into the game, and combined with the game mechanics make this feel like a high end hunting simulator.

The only thing that seems off about the game is the animal AI. Had a female moose walk up approximately 10 feet in front of me while I was crouched before it panicked and took off. Another odd occurrence is when you spook an animal and it flees, sometimes the pathfinding it takes is a little bizarre. As someone who hunts White Tail Deer in real life, I can't help but notice the pathfinding while fleeing doesn't seem entirely natural.

[h1] Very nice, calming and relaxing game! [/h1]

This game gives you a really good hunting experience and content which never ends as you decide on your own when it's time to stop. Also great way to spend some time with friends!

Be advised: This game requires a lot of patience. Often most of the time you're just following tracks and sneaking on some animal trying to not scare it and some times you still scare it away. It can get frustrating, as you walk around for 4 hours and can't get a shot. But this is just how it is and the moment you get one it feels amazing!

I never thought I'd be so excited for such a game since I mostly came from FPS competitve background. This game is a really nice change.

You see poop on the ground, it says ""Just Now"", you sneak forward and the next poop you see is ""Very Fresh"" and then you move further and then it says ""Fresh"", but if you move faster the animal runs away, it's impossible for me to even see an animal unless it is one eating or drinking, but at that point it is so far away that I can't take the shot or I'll miss (which is honestly my problem), I move further towards it and it runs away again, repeating everything I said above.
""you have to be patient and not run around"" well if I am patient the animal runs away faster than I can catch up and I dont get it either, what's the fucking point? I can't even imagine how slow you would be if you tried to track an animal while being prone.
I tried it again a few years later and I still fucking hate it. I tracked an animal for an hour and it always fled even though it was not within line of sight, the wind wasn't a problem and I was crouching. I killed two other animals on the way because it took so fucking long. And it may be realistic but how fucking long can an animal bleed for fuck's sake.

At least sale prices bring the bundles with the essentials to a more realistic price point. I went into the game knowing this and got it on sale, but it's still scummy of the publisher.

Another big issue with the game though is that the new player experience if you're not familiar with hunting in RL is extremely poor. I bought this over the other hunting games since many reviews said that while the other was a better simulator, this was a better game even if it was a bit arcadey. That may be true once you figure out how to break the animal AI, but for a new player this is animal spook simulator. To add insult to injury, the starting ammo for your starter rifle is a poor choice for the deer you're asked to hunt right off the bat and you have to level up a few times to get actually decent ammo. The game tells you none of this, I kept shooting deer where you're supposed to (again had to look it up outside of the game since it drops you in with basically no guidance) and outside of a couple lucky shots I would just wound them and they had ""very low blood loss"" and would run halfway across the map with what I would assume to be a very significant wound in RL. Not impressed with the new player experience.

At least the DLC guns in the bundle are available right away, kind of progression breaking, but given how bad progression so far is I honestly don't care.",1700871569,1700871569,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While it might have its bugs here and there (Usually coursed by an update or new content - They usually get fixed), it can give you some the most satisfying moments, when you accomplish to get your hands on a trophy-worthy animal. Perhaps your shot was impressive too! 
The game isn't from 2021, but the graphics never seize to impress me. The surroundings and the way the animals behave around it really helps on making yourself emerge into the feeling of being out on a hunt. 
Play it with friends, it only gets better. Communication, tracking, guiding. With teamwork, you can bring home some of the best and most memorable trophies for your lodge!  

Although, with the multiplayer-option, there are a few points that could be up for improvement: 
- Story line mission together. The game has a campaign, but it is only available in single-player mode. Would be great if you could share that experience with your friends as well, discuss the stories as you go.    
- Non-campaign mission. Start a map, choose a handful of missions with varied difficulties perhaps (Depending on your equipment) and go get it done! 
- Hunt Club Beta overhaul. The game has a feature called ""Hunt Club Beta"". Those are dailies, weeklies and community missions. The community being the only one with a shared progress (Unfortunately). - Sadly, this feature has been out of order for a while.

The base game has two maps, one of which is still in my top 5 reserves.

I do recommend maybe watching a few tutorials for beginners but theHunter: Call of the Wild is a very easy game to get into.

Strengths of this game include:

1. HUGE maps, with many to choose from.
2. Solid graphics.
3. Randomness!!! - Encountering a super rare animal of a lifetime, with random fur patterns and randomly generated 4. horns, adds a unique touch to each find. You can save it to your house and show your friends the slaughter you accomplished. That's the number one fun factor for me.
4. Continuous development with patches and content, albeit mostly paid. For me, this is a strength because I love supporting the game rather than letting it die.

Weaknesses:
1. Mild bugs and map imperfections.
2. If you want all DLCs, you have to take out a loan.
3. The inventory management system is kind of confusing and hard to learn initially, but after a while, you'll get it.

Overall, I love it. There's no better and more sophisticated hunting game out there, with plenty of content to explore. Nothing rushes you, and you can switch off and relax after a hard day. It might be pretty boring for younger gamers, though.",1609514401,1700848113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been a kind of therapy to be able to roam the absolutely gorgeous environments of Layton Lakes and  Hirschfelden. I would have been content just to treat the game as a walking simulator, but I found myself really enjoying the hunting as well. I understand now something of what real life hunters get out of the experience. There's a genuine thrill to finally bagging that quarry you've been tracking and trying to coax out for what seems like forever. (I'm looking at you, coyotes and foxes.)

It's also admittedly a flawed game missing a certain amount of polish. Many problems are smaller quality of life issues, but the big one for me is the limited animal pathfinding. Too often I've caught up to a herd stuck on a hillside going in circles, for example.

Having said that, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons enough that I'd recommend anyone give the base game a try even if only for the landscapes as I originally did. Happy Hunting!",1606694986,1700791969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, 5 years have gone down the road, and I still play this game like it's a brand new game that I want to play every day. Some people may be wondering, why do I love it so much. Well, I'll explain. It's one game that has always been my go-to when I don't know what to play (in fact I'm about to start it up as I type this). It's one game that once you get to understanding more, you can easily learn all the anatomy of all these animals, and even more-so, when you become a good shot, it's super easy. My goal is to one day unlock every single achievement, out of respect of the fact I've been playing it this long, might as well. Another amazing thing, the graphics. Now some people may say they are a bit wonky, which I agree at times, but overall, it's amazing how these graphics are. They are absolutely stunning, my opinion. Another plus, all the different maps and animals available are insane. I can go on all day about why I love this game so much, bu I'll spare it.

Be warned if you have never hunted in real life this game can be a bit tricky to have with because you truly have to almost crawl everywhere in order to not scare off animals with sound.


Pros:
-Beautiful game engine
-Realistic animal behavior MOST of the time
-Animals can hear you from very very far, which makes bagging an animal even more satisfying
-Lots of weapon choices, ammo choices, calls, and bait
-The game does an excellent job of making tracking animals as easy as possible by highlighting tracks that you are following and other tracks a seperate color and showing how old poop is to inform you of the age of the tracks of the animal.
-There is a story mode and it can be fun to level up
-There is online multiplayer with friends and you can all go hunting together

Cons:
-The game is almost worthless without the DLC for ATV and Tents, these two items should have obviously been in the game from the start and not set up as DLC, without tents or ATV's it is almost impossible to get around easily and meet your friends, what is worse is you can not ride a friends ATV, you have to have your own, and Tents are essentially fast travel locations that you can put up anywhere and that anyone can travel to, you can also resupply at a tent making them invaluable.  I like to place tents where animals usually show up and then fast travel between them.
-The game does make you level up in order to unlock the calls ytou need to really start bagging animals, if you do not play story missions it will take some time before you are able to aquire these items.
-This is a hunting simulator, I have played for 45 minutes stalking and tracking to never ever even see an animal, and came up empty, if this does not sound like something you can handle maybe look at an arcade type hunting game.




Overall really good simulation game if you have time to kill, and like to relax and go slow and take your time.


EDIT: After almost 100 hours I have learned to check drinking spots and to use lures, animals are much easier to find now!",1523560433,1700695927,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Each map is pretty large. Ive yet to fully explore one with 50 something hours clocked. There's a nice variety of animals to hunt on each map. The game features a story mode in singleplayer which is a nice touch. There's a night and day cycle, and animals follow a schedule based on the time of day. The game is buggy however. Getting off an ATV on a incline makes your view crooked once off it, You can't hear Roe deer calls in multiplayer, Sound distance calibration seems to be off - Other players gunshots sometimes sound like they're right next to me even if they're 600m away, Animals get stuck in place sometimes etc.

My only major complaint about this game is the DLC. A lot of the content in the DLC packs should come with the base game. Hunting blinds / stands is an example. Without buying any DLC, Deer hunter the 2005 season has more content....

As someone who never thought a hunting game could hold my interest for long, I found myself utterly engrossed in its serene and enjoyable gameplay. If you're the type of player who thrives on ""run and gun"" action like Call of Duty, well, this might not be your cup of tea. But for those who appreciate a slower, more methodical approach, this game offers a rewarding and relaxing experience.

Let me clarify something upfront: theHunter: Call of the Wild is not a hardcore hunting simulator like its sibling, theHunter Classic. Instead, it blends simulation elements into a gaming experience that demands your attention to its challenging learning curve. You'll need to consider factors like noise, wind direction, and more to succeed. Charging through the woods with guns a-blazing will only leave you empty-handed and frustrated. Take your time, be patient, and you'll find plenty of animals to track and hunt. It's a refreshing departure from the mindless shooting galleries found in most other hunting games.

The game features a leveling system that rewards both player progression and weapon skill. As you level up, you unlock new weapons and gear, providing a satisfying sense of achievement. The journey culminates at Level 60, but fear not, for you can always start anew if you crave another round.

For those who enjoy missions, the base game (and DLCs) offers a variety of engaging quests. These provide in-game cash and experience for leveling up, making them a great way to acquire new equipment. However, missions are entirely optional, so you can chart your own course if you prefer.

When it comes to the numerous DLCs, fear not! In multiplayer, all hunting reserve DLCs are absolutely free to everyone, but single-player and equipment access will require purchase. The weapon pack DLCs are enjoyable but not necessary, as the base game weapons provide a similar experience. Other DLCs like ATVs, dogs, blinds, and tree stands offer convenience but don't add much beyond time-saving. Personally, I prefer to enjoy exploring on foot rather than zooming by on an ATV, scaring off all the wildlife.

If you're uncertain about diving in, keep an eye out for one of the frequent sales, both for the base game and the DLCs. It may not be the most hardcore hunting simulator, but its powerful blend of simulation and gameplay elements creates a truly enjoyable and immersive hunting adventure. You’ll be addicted in no time.",1543102847,1700665520,True,5,0,0.578046619892120361,0,True,False,False

The visuals are amazing, and tracking your prey takes time to master, and incorporates skill and patience. There aren't many options and gear, but with time those will eventually be added.

What I think makes The Hunter stand out is the fact that is isn't an idiotic arcade game, but rather a simulation. The hunter mate gadget is not a realistic tool which helps you track deer, but it still doesn't hold your hand like the other hunting games do.

With many reserves to choose from, ranging all across the world, there is no shortage of game to hunt.  From the standard White-tail Deer all the way to an African Lion, what you want to hunt is entirely up to you.  Weapon variety is solid, including rifles, pistols, bows, and handguns of all sizes.

The game is beautiful and fun to wander around in.  After 200 hours, I still get the shakes when I spot a diamond down in the valley, call it in, and attempt that fatal shot.

Update after almost 500 hours:  I've played a lot of multiplayer recently and it's definitely a positive in this game. If you have the DLC maps, you can invite your friends to play, whom may not have one of the reserves, and they can play on your version of the reserve without having to pay. It makes getting into the game and also deciding which maps you like/don't like a little less costly.

Diamonds are forever.

To which my response is always with these questions:
[list]
[*]Do you hunt in real life?
[*]Do you like a more slow paced/relaxed game?
[*]Do you enjoy the thrill of the hunt, even if that hunt may take 3 hours
just for that one good shot at a single trophy animal?
[*]Do you enjoy games where you can team up with friends and/or strangers
and have a good laugh?
[*]Do you enjoy open world games with multiple maps, and awesome graphics?
[/list]

If you answered yes to some of those questions then maybe this game is
for you, however if you think that you can run around everywhere getting
headshots on every animal you see then I'm sorry, but you're going to
be disappointed and maybe this game isn't for you. If you are still not
sure then there is always youtube for those that may want to do some
more research.

Ok then to start off with, playing the Hunter: Call of the Wild requires
planning, skill, and alot of patience, you will need to use the terrain
to your advantage, while keeping a close eye on the wind direction, your
noise level, and the visibility meter as well. Sure (like most games
these days) it has it's bugs, but the Hunter: Call Of The Wild is still
reasonably early on in development compared to Expansive Worlds other
hunting game, so it can hopefully only get better with time.
I've had the game for awhile now, and I still make a backup save manually
from time to time just to be on the safe side, and for any new players you
should also do the same.  Manually backing up your save file and putting it
somewhere else on your machine can save ALOT of frustration. It can be
really annoying to have mission resets, loss of in-game currency,
loss of XP, and levels. It is perhaps, the biggest issue the game has
right now unfortunately.

Don't be put off though, I haven't had any of these major bugs happen to
me, and apart from the occasional crash every now and then, I've had an
awesome experience playing this. It's one of those games that is easy to
pick up, but hard to master, so to help get you started there are plenty
of singleplayer missions for you to complete, from photo missions to
hunting specific animals, there is plenty to do and will take sometime
to finish them all. The multiplayer side of things is very good too, and
while I consider this to be the most bug filled part in the Hunter: Call
Of The Wild, it is still awesome to play, especially with friends.

So then with all of that being said, I absolutely recommend this game to
any and all, you don't necessarily need to be a real life hunter to enjoy
this game, and with a vast array of DLC to choose from, (I recommend the
other hunting reserves, the Weapon Packs, and the High Tech Hunting Pack
to start off with) grab this game and get the lead out.

Thanks for reading, and if you get this game, happy hunting.",1587275157,1700625272,True,122,10,0.856967687606811523,5,True,False,False

What I thought might be an interesting diversion for a few plays unexpectedly became an obsession that I wish I'd taken a chance on much earlier. There is quite simply nothing else out there even remotely like this game. It's Fallout: NV meets Dear Esther meets.. old school Everquest rare spawn camping? Oh, and there's hunting as well.

The world is amazingly well realized, with the many different reserves each offering a gorgeous and serene environment in which to complete quests (missions) ranging from killing a certain animal with a certain weapon to the more straight forward ""Go to this campsite and see if the yoga instructor there was eaten by a bear."" (Spoiler alert, she was eaten by the fucking bear). The AI of the animals you hunt is incredible. The living world moves on whether you interact with it or not as the other inhabitants go about their daily routines of travelling, resting, eating, and drinking. They act realistically to sound, sight, and smell, and you must behave accordingly or you'll scare them off before you even see them. Note: Much like real life hunting, the game requires patience and if you lack that, this may not be for you. But even  in sessions where I saw precious few animals, the zen quality of just existing in the various reserves was never a waste of time. 

After a hard day, coming home and escaping into this world has been the best gaming experience I have had in a long time. If you think this may even remotely be up your alley, take a chance! I recommend getting all of the DLC in a bundle during the sale, as it is all worthwhile. My only caveat is that the devs quit adding new Achievements and Side Missions to the last few DLC packs, which lowers the replayability. Some have also bemoaned the addition of cosmetics, but they can largely be ignored and they have even given several packs away for free.",1637796446,1700605337,True,75,2,0.842194974422454834,0,True,False,False

Disclaimer: I've payed for all the DLCs, because I don't like the butchered versions of my games. I've only played on Layton Lakes so far. I know about the shooting range in Hirschfelden, but it does not negate my second point.

This game is fun for me and I'll keep playing it. However, it suffers from the following:

1. Too many bugs (e.g. AI pathfinding is atrocious — animals, including your paid DLC dog, constantly bump into and/or get blocked by boulders; sometimes my gadget breaks and I can't see any marked tracks on its display, not even my dog indicator, so I lose sight of my dog, I have to restart the game in a middle of a pursuit of a wounded animal — it's so frustrating). This breaks the immersion significantly. Also, did I mention the crashes?
2. It is extremely grindy. It's almost impossible to enjoy this game in a casual manner. You can't jump in and simply test your gear (some of which is paywalled, but more on that later) right away, as you can in Arma 3, for example.
3. When you begin to play, you're given extremely limited information about the behaviours and the states of the animals. You're bound to read external guides and maps, if you hate wasting your time.
4. At the beginning, you don't have access to decent ammunition (higher penetration is what you should be aiming for, don't waste your in-game money for hollow-points, as I did). This results in an extreme disadvantage in long range shots (which are almost the only shots you'll have the opportunity to take at the beginning, because you haven't learned to be patient/silent and don't know about the fact that you need to crouch-walk/crawl all the føkken time yet and you spook animals 200 metres away before you're even able to see them).
5. Software-as-a-service ""business model"" scam + paywalls everywhere = a game that most people expect to enjoy in a singleplayer. Føkk this 5#1+, I am so sick of it.
6. If you decide that you want a less arcadey and more of a simulator experience, you can turn off the highlighting of the animal tracks. However, it's very hard to notice them that way if you're just starting to play, unless they are very well illuminated (most of the time they are not). Then, you have the option of buyng a DLC - the bloodhound. It can do the following of bloodtrails/droppings for you somewhat reliably. Doesn't make it a piece of cake, though, it's still kinda tough to pursue an animal which you couldn't shoot in the organs for some reason (cf. point 4).
7. If you decide that you wanna cosplay as Robin Hood, I mean, you decide to go with a bow/crossbow, then get ready for lots of frustration and even more grind. Before you get the hang of distance estimation and arrow drop which naturally comes after many hours of experience (you need your animals to be around 30 metres away from you — good luck not spooking them with the tiniest noise you make while crouched/prone), you will give up and pay more money for the tripod/treestand (yes, they are paywalled).
8. Get ready to re-download the whole game (30GB download, 60 GB installation) after every single update. Good luck with the reduced lifespan of your SSD. I'm sorry, but this is føkken ridiculous.
9. The zeroing is arcadey and has fixed values (25/50/75 metres or 75/150/300 metres). You will not actually learn how much of a struggle (especially for an unsupervised beginner, such as I am) it is to zero a weapon IRL.
10. You must pay in-game money for sleeping in a cabin (e.g. you want to fast forward to daylight, because you føkken hate not being able to see 5#1+ during the night, because the night-vision scope & night-vision binoculars are paywalled).
11. Oh, yeah, in-game money is hard to come by. The prices for some weapons (some of which are required for quests, e.g. the .45-70 lever action rifle costs 48000 money) are insanely high (cf. point 2). Also, don't waste your in-game money for the hunting structures (as I did) — they are overpriced and are next to useless (offering limited angles and distances).
12. Some of the quests require luck, not skill.

That's all I can think of right now, I'm sure there's more.

A few good things:
a) The game looks and sounds beautiful. Unfortunately, this wears off quickly, after you get acquainted with the flaws I mentioned above (especially point 1).
b) You will learn a thing or two about shot placement. As Paul Harrell said (while discussing the legal consequences of participating in a citizen-involved shooting): ""there is no replacement for shot placement"".
c) It's fun only if you can accept the grindiness.
d) To appreciate the autoloaders (before you ask — yes, the ARs are paywalled), you will need to make the game a little bit ""harder"" for you. Go to Settings -> Game -> turn off ""Auto chambering"". Now, every bolt action rifle/pump action shotgun/single-action revolver will have to be c0ck3d manually (default button R) after each shot. You will appreciate the autoloaders' IRL added value (yes, the semi-automatics are also referred to as ""autoloaders"").
e) (EDIT from 23-NOV-2022) I'm giving a ""Labour of love"" nomination, since I'm willing to bet that almost all the problems are due to poor management & lead game designer decisions, not because the people who actually create the game are incompetent/lazy/scammers.

Animals are easily spooked and it needs one to arm himself with a patience, because hunting is slow-paced. Travelling without ATV DLC is slow (DLC recommendedú but there's many ""wow"" moments over the theater play of environment and weather. UI needs a rework, I was confused in inventory for a minute or two when I wanted to swap callers equipment). There's two maps now but if you want to play the second one, you lose all progress of first one (needs to change, make it more convenient for player).

They said they would only release normal Map DLC, and surely 
the first DLC was Medved-Taiga, it looked like they were keeping true to their promise. Shortly after that they released the Quad DLC, while arguably not vital, gamers already predicted they were straying away from the promise.

Recently they've announced paid customization like skins for weapons and probably more to come. We've come full circle and it shows greed never changes. Instead of repairing bugs, sticking with map DLCs or moving on to another project they are making this choice. The've lost my support, period.

When it first released it was a quality hunting simulator, in an age where those were doomed to retarded levels of realism and graphics worse than ugly. Nowadays simulators are popular and there is decent competition in every niche. Instead of innovating and positioning them firmly within one segment they chose the easy money way out.

It's not possible to really hunt in my country so I can't argue about realism, however it's still a game and a balance needs to be struck. Still, I am a veteran gamer and I can recognize quality game-play and performance and I also recognize a cash-grab, this is one!

This game unfortunately suffers from some greedy devs who feel the need to charge for every single idea they come up with. As far as I am aware the new Labrador will be a separate $5 DLC, when it should be included with the bloodhound pack. If I am incorrect about that then I will change this part of my review to be correct, though I am still keeping my stance on a negative review. They also charge for every new map that comes out and every new weapons pack that comes out. So, they charge for separate pets, separate weapons packs, and each individual map that comes out. that is a lot of ways they are bringing in money and some of which fair enough but it's still a lot, especially when some should be included with others. The devs also seem to not know very much about firearms, because I shouldn't be looking at the sky after shooting a .300 or a .308. The recoil is very over dramatized and should be adjusted for many of the firearms, as well as the ammo capacities. It is insane that you have firearms like the 4570 which only holds 3 but a real life counter part can hold 8. I understand that there should be challenges within the game but there should be a middle ground somewhere. With all this being said I think I have been enjoying way of the hunter a bit more. I haven't had the chance to play it multiplayer yet so I wont give that one a review yet but I do think it is worth considering over this title.",1561867359,1700582311,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's alot of different animals you can hunt and the game rewards patient and smart play pretty well, while also giving you a pretty decent starting rifle that even has free ammo you can get from the shop infinitely. The starting rifle is also capable of comfortably taking almost all of the most common animals in the game, so it's not a cheap cop-out like alot of other game's starting guns. Most of the DLC maps also come with a pretty decent free weapon you can unlock by just running around and doing missions for the wardens, so you even get rewarded for actually engaging with the story, if you choose to call it that.

unfortunately... I have a few gripes I have to bring up.

There's a persistent bug that I've had in this game since I bought it where on basically all of the DLC maps besides the taiga, no animal track markers appear no matter what settings I tamper with, even though in the non-DLC maps, they appear just fine. This basically means finding anything in the DLC maps for me comes down to pure luck. This also applies to blood trails. They can be found and interacted with, but again there's no trail or directional cone, so I kinda get bullied by the game into having to bring the dog along to find any animals I shoot, which kinda cucks you since the dog can spook animals if you're tracking an animal you didn't kill in one shot, starting your whole chase all over again.

It's a little shameful that such a fundamental necessity of the game has this issue and nothing I do seems to actually fix it, from pressing C to toggle tracks, to using the binoculars, to resetting all the settings in the menu, to even a full uninstall and reinstall... 

Alot of the best weapons and hunting is locked into the DLC content and this could probably be a sore point for alot of people. I don't see it as a big issue since the game DOES need to make money to keep getting support, but it does mean some of the base guns can feel a bit bland at times. Alot of the more fun guns in the base game are also pretty brutally priced, or locked behind level requirements that can make the game feel pretty grindy to get the fun guns you want. It almost feels like paying for success, even though the base guns are all perfectly good.

As much as I personally love this game, and do wholeheartedly recommend it if you like hunting games, the issues I keep having with it cripple the game for me and until the game either cooperates with me or I can figure it out, It gets bumped from an 8/10 from me down to a 6/10 since there's literally an entirely necessary aspect of the game that is non-functional for me for no discernible reason.

However i wouldn't say it's for everyone because you need to have a lot of patience while playing. The game can get frustrating but it also comes with a lot of joy when you finally get the animal you have been wanting. 

One con of this game is the DLC. The DLC is great, but some of them such as the ATV should be included in the base game. Other DLC's such as tents and tree stands almost seem necessary for the game. I would also recommend getting at least 1 weapons pack because it takes so long to buy them with in game currency.

I have spent a lot of time in the game in the included maps and a few dlcs i picked up, and there is no game that sucks me in quite like this one. It is just so peaceful and full of life that on occasion I am content with just walking around!
The gun play and the hit registry is pretty good from what I can tell with the occasional mishap (like any other game). Sometimes the AI animals are very not intelligent and can be found getting caught on the terrain semi regularly, but in general they are faithful to behavior in real life.
I highly recommend you get a dlc map or two (my personal favorites are the emerald coast and yukon valley as my all time favorite, and in my opinion, are a must have if you want to get this game and experience the best it can offer)
This game is worth every cent I put into it, including the dlc. Everything is wonderful and feels unique in its own way. There are so many stories you can make in your mind because of how the game is structured.

if you feel like running around and going on a rampage against the wildlife being an eco-terrorist, you can do that!
If you want to try and be stealthy in your approach for a particularly rare set of antlers on a deer, you can do that!
If you want to drive your atv (dlc required) around and decide you want to go exploring for fun and look at the VERY expansive terrain, you can do that!
The system requirements are not strenuous, so this will run on even integrated graphics a lot of the time on modern CPUs.

I have however, several problems with the game :

- The dlcs sometimes ruin the experience by giving op weapons, and sometimes just buggy and uninteresting maps. You can really tell when they don't put any effort in a dlc, like the cammo ones. They even lock some basic features like the quad or the tripods behind paywall, a bit greedy in my opinion.
- The quests are bad most of the time, and if in some maps (like the free ones) they're decent and at least have some objective, in others they just want you to walk to see if a random lake isn't poluted or if Joe is back from his trip in the old mine. I wish the quests would interact with the world a bit more and maybe add to the progression system which is mid imo. Some quests are also sometimes not not doable, like it asks to hunt blacktail deer in a zone where there are none to be found.
- The multiplayer doesn't add anything to the base game (except your friends), it even removes the possibility to do quests, and except from the challenges (wich give nothing, not even XP), there's no real goal. You're gonna have to set some for yourself.
- My biggest complain about this game is how the animals are so predictible. At least when you've played alot, you can see what they're gonna do, where they're gonna go, and where you're gonna be able to absolutely massacre them. If you haven't played this game yet, I recommend not checking any video on farming money or XP, or diamond animals, just enjoy the game. What has made me sad, is when after playing (kindof) roleplay (running from the bears, ambushing, using scents), I realised that I could just play like a brute and kill whatever I wanted.

So that's it, I still really like this game, I've played a lot with friends and solo, and it was great, until I discovered how easy it was to farm animals. Don't do like me and enjoy the game longer by not watching videos about it.

Cotw as a base game offers a decent amount of animals, equipment, and varying play styles. Gone are the limitations of being yelled at for not having the gun/license needed for the animal. You can shoot down Bison with a pistol and use a shotgun on a rabbit. 

The base game also offers ""aggressive"" animals which pose a nice challenge of having to defend yourself after the initial shot. Or...you could full tilt run at the animal and like anyone with common sense, it will run screaming from the maniac with a gun repeatedly shooting at it until it dies. 

The graphics are gorgeous, even on low quality. There's several screenshots I have saved of just...photogenic areas. The controls aren't bad either. I only had to change 2 keybinds to suit my style.

That being said, there's some aspects of the game I thoroughly hate. 

The sound design being the biggest problem for me. I will say, I'm HoH and so usually my issue with games is being unable to hear the sounds. Not with Cotw. Instead, I'm wishing I could play completely silently. Cotw sounds are horror film style whisper until you turn the volume up and then blast you with the loudest thing ever. Whitetail deer scream louder than fnaf animatronics.

In a hunting game, sound is crucial for a lot of aspects. Trying to find that animal through calls or the crunch of foliage under its feet. Everything in Cotw makes a sound however. Everything. Even you when you're standing still. And sounds are seemingly random and lag behind actions. If I had a dime for every time I made a footstep crunch while crouched down on an outpost unmoving, I'd have enough to buy the full dlc.

And you know those scenes in movies where people fire guns into the air to quiet down a panicking crowd or get attention? Yeah, I do that now. For ducks/geese. The sounds for those infernal birds overtakes all other sounds. It's unbearable. So if I wind up near those beasts, I wind up sacrificing any hunt by madly firing my gun to get them to go away. 

Other than that, cotw is ultimately a walking sim and that can be pretty draining on your want to play for long. Pretty graphics but you can't sit and wait for animals to show up anymore because they seemed to overcompensate for previous camping by giving every single animal superman style super hearing. All animals can hear you for over 200 meters away. Even if you're doing nothing. So waiting in an outpost is just signing yourself up to hours of nothing.

Instead, you find yourself roaming around, waiting for an animal to spot you from far away, crouch and shuffle unbelievably slowly towards it. I don't hate it but I don't love it either. There are times I want to boot up this game and sit in a good hiding spot and wait. I haven't been able to do that at all.

Tracking your animal after you shoot it needs serious improvements. I'm low level so I don't know if the skills/perks help but I do know I could find a dead animal in classic far easier than I can in cotw. I spent 5 in game hours looking for the corpse of a bison. A BISON. It's not like it was hidden under a bush! And not to mention some corpses just vanish into thin air. You manage to hit that lucky shot and immediately kill the animal and poof there it goes. Raptured into heaven.

Overall, I'm enjoying cotw and there's some dlc I'm interested in. It's not a high energy game but I still feel accomplished when I nail a hunt.

The mechanics of the game are  reasonably well implemented  and polished and it appears the designers/ devs did their homework as far as  animal behaviour and hunting methods are concerned.

After playing this game a reasonable amount and taking some time away to reflect on the experience I cannot recommend it to anyone for the following simple reason:

Language and it's usage are important and from the very earliest days of firearms use and development there has been a very simple way to differentiate between firearms used as tools for hunting of animals for food/ sport - and their use as 'weapons' used to injure or kill human beings.

Firearms designed as tools for hunting/ food procurement are referred to as 'firearms' or guns.

Only firearms designed for use against humans are referred to as 'weapons'. 

History has shown this distinction to be critically important time and again in more ways than it would be possible to recount here.

Obviously and unfortunately there are instances where hunting firearms are/ have been used against people as 'weapons'. This neither dilutes nor diminishes the importance of referring to them as what they were designed for - ""this hunting rifle was used as a 'weapon' against a person during a self defence emergency"".

This hunting games' insistence on using the term 'weapon' to describe hunting firearms smacks of the same rhetoric and intentional twisting/ misuse of language currently being used to push legislative changes that would disarm the populations of every western country you care to name. A similar decades long campaign by anti gun zealots has seen widespread uptake of the nonsensical term 'assault' rifle to describe carbines of all make and manner (even airsoft guns in some places??).

Sad really, and whether this developer choice was made out of sheer ignorance (unlikely given they obviously had experienced hunters advising them) or with the intent to subtly reinforce anti gun messaging is largely immaterial - the damage is done.

Avoid this game and be sure your kids know how to spot anti gun/ anti human rights indoctrination in all media.

Best wishes

I love this game, i sunk a lot of time and money into it, but every day i play i just get slapped in the face. In ways i feel like Cabela's hunting games are more fun.

The current most biggest bug i've been experiencing lately are ""ghost bullets"", I can have the perfect animal right in front of me, clear open field with nothing to accidentally hit, rifle is zeroed correctly, aim perfectly at the lungs, and yet when i fire magically there is no bullet; what would have been a kill shot turned into firing a blank and scaring off the animal.
This occurs so frequently i'm right about to just quit playing entirely and move over to another game.

Another issue with the game is DLC's, so many of these things should have been free to begin with, the whole team behind this game are so money hungry- and even with all that money they cant even produce a decent game, its genuinely laughable how sad the creators are of this mess.

I would only tell people to get this game if you've already tried all the other hunting games, this game used to be one of the best hunting games out there, even years ago with all the other bugs, but it only seems to be getting worse- in terms of bugs and overall effort, the more maps and dlc's they push out for money the sadder and more of the same they all start to become.
These Swedes are a joke.
Even their newest game- theAngler was an absolute flop, like legit terrible.


Oh, and this game is just cringe as well, it's a game all about hunting, right? Well every single main story mission on each map is a f%cking Scooby-Doo mystery and all you do is run around the map pushing E on whatever they want you to, it's so boring and stupid. I'm here to brain little animals not be the detective in a children's book.

EDIT: New bug to me, animals straight up vanishing in thin air right in front of me. Legit quitting this game for a solid year, if they dont fix their sh#t i am never returning.


[HEY DEVS] Make clothing do something like it did in Classic. (i.e. certain clothes reduce your scent, noise, and vision).
 If you aren't going to make guns 100% steady when holding breath AND having all the points for steady breath- just add a bipod we can silently deploy before shots.
Make animals behave like actual animals, stop making them just walk constantly until they eventually get to their need zone- if i startle call they should sit there and watch closely for a while, not either ignore it completely or immediately run off.
Make the scope/binocular sensitivity consistent- for ex. its stupid to have 4x zoom be 0.25 sens and 8 zoom be 1.0
Make sitting in blinds and calling actually worth it, need zones are meta and boring. 99.9% of the time its better to just run around and shoot everything that moves.
Get rid of hunting pressure, just make animals actually dynamic.
Add a way to sit down- so you can get the same height as crouching, but with the same visibility as crawling, and you cant move.",1555987672,1699528466,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, even I with days in this game can't recommend it as they keep selling new content and leaving it a buggy mess, not fixing any of the maps or providing any real depth beyond a kind of weak, bad story-lined mission system, no map based unlocks or skins or any real reason to play a map beyond the animals they put on it. Like C'mon I live in australia but you could give us some aboriginal art weapon skins to unlock or something, the maps just end up feeling so cookie cutter despite the environmental and animal differences.

Feels like people who love hunting and have no knowledge of game or mechanic design lucked out and made a serviceable game. but I have 0 faith they'll fix anything or provide any user friendly features in the future which is an utter disapointment.

Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication.",1687698451,1698792122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you HAVE to play an actual hunting game where you need to be sneaky and snipe animals its either this game or the other and i do not understand why there isn't more of these games, there is so much potential, you could make a game about being a space hunter and hunting aliens from other planets using futuristic weaponry or have one where is monster hunter style where humanity itself is at stake (but you are a just human so if the monsters find you you will probably get murdered like 80% of the time unless you kill the monster before it gets to you) or alternatively you could have a hunting game based on the progression of hunting through human history where you start with sticks and stones into throwing spears into the atlatl, bow and so on until this point in time or more in the future with railguns and stuff (where you cold just play the first game example lmao)

I want a hunting game with progression that is actually well made, i do not care for it to be realistic, i like this genere, but sadly it doesn't really exist, if someone with interest of making an actual hunting game is reading this, please, don't go the realistic route, if you differ you will pretty much generate free advertisement by the fact that your game is different.",1661495372,1698630395,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's fun to choose your weapon loadout to hunt with, it's relaxing to roam around nature reserves and they look stunning. Depth to the sneaking and shooting mechanics keeps you engaged. You never know what's going to happen. It varies between slow and (very) exciting. For example, you may suddenly be charged by a bear while you have your pea shooter out lining up a shot on a small animal. No two sessions are the same.

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
There are far too many. Here's some examples. There's an age old bug causing region names to no longer appear on the map so you don't know where a mission is trying to tell you to go. I found a dirt road texture hovering above the ground where it was supposed to be. Grass (which is everywhere) will flicker on a map released 5 years ago, but not consistently. One playsession it will be fine, the next it'll happen constantly. I keep running into glitched spots where one block of terrain meets another with an invisible collision box that makes you walk straight up into the air instead the direction you're trying to go. Iron sights are often misaligned. You sometimes crawl through rocks instead of over them when prone. There are white lines connecting parts of mountains and hills together like glued back together ceramic vases.

The devs' parent company recently opened a new office in Manhattan, one of the most expensive locations on the planet. Now you know where all that DLC money is going instead of being used to hire QA testers and programmers focused on bug fixing.

The reason this developer still exists is a lack of serious competition in a niche genre.

[h1]Lazy game design decisions[/h1]
There are so many examples of this I could spend hours listing them all. I'll mention a few so you kinda get the idea. No reward for exploration despite awful movement over rough terrain, can't interact with objects (there aren't any character animations for that) or even knock over a trash bin. Lookout towers, important locations, are copy/pasted clones with no interaction with any of the furniture inside - you can only open/close doors. Opening / closing a glass sliding door out to the porch, the same audio sample is played as for a normal wooden door inside. Trampolines outside cannot be used and if you jump on one from a higher position you'll land on the air above it, unable to reach its surface. Shooting a soccer ball instead of an animal will make the ball bleed because a bloody decal is placed on it.

The maps have nature and animals, that's it. Nothing else. You can either shoot the animals or be bored out of your skull. What if I get bored of shooting animals, you ask? My point exactly, even though that will keep you busy for longer than you think there's obviously an expiration date.

Collisions between animals and the quad bike (ATV DLC) are all wrong and result in the player taking HP damage, seeing a red flash and just bouncing off of the animal which doesn't even get pushed off its course it was running on.

There's points of interest with flavor text and a handful of ""artifacts"" to be found through exploration of each map/reserve. They're so lame it's laughable that the developer thinks these are truly interesting to the player. Makes you feel like the game designer has never played a game before. It's just filler.

No gamma/brightness settings, no fps limiter. The only anti-aliasing modes available are ""FXAA"" and ""FXAA + TAA"". You can't enable contact shadows (which add a lot of nice contrast to grass / foliage) without enabling ""FXAA + TAA"". Without AA, tree canopies are unrealisticially pixel-y / grainy and both AA modes on offer degrade the raw image quality by softening things too much. Only when ""FXAA + TAA"" is enabled does the game let you enable sharpening (a custom amount) and it's not able to undo all of the damage. As another side effect of TAA, canopies (and grass) in motion are smeared out blobs until they stop moving.

[h1]Missions[/h1]
The game is very, very light on story. You don't meet NPC's in the actual game world. Missions are presented by voice over + on screen static avatar in the UI. They're tasks with some made up reason / background info for them handed to you in what is mainly a sandbox experience of hunting animals on a vast map. By tasks I mean, e.g. kill animal type X from a hunting stand in location Y. There may not even be any of those animals in that area which is another problem with the game. After waiting several in-game days I ended up using the ATV DLC to scare animals into the area from elsewhere. (Essential DLC if you don't want to spend hours walking to get from A to B.)

[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]
It takes a huge amount of patience to play theHunter. I still enjoy the game but it's definitely not for everyone. If you run or even just walk upright through vegetation, you'll spook every animal and never even see any. You have to slow yourself to a crawl, often literally. It's fun to mess around with different weapon loadouts. This game is to hunting almost what Sniper Elite 4 is to sniping: somewhat game-ified. E.g. ammo calibres aren't realistic.

It won't make most people's all-time top 10 but it has enough going for it to be some people's absolute favorite game. It offers a unique, slower paced, immersive experience with plenty of exciting moments too. After hundreds of hours I personally still enjoy it a lot. Objectively it's about a 7.5 out of 10 as the lack of production quality and devs' carelessness detract from the experience. If the devs weren't so lazy it could've easily been a 9 out of 10.",1664487695,1698618441,True,0,0,0.566673696041107178,0,True,False,False

first, 90% of the game is DLC locked, you cant escape it. they don't hide DLC-Only content, they make sure you see it no matter what. you go to select which map you go to, and all but one of the options are DLC locked and you have to look at each one to find the only one that isn't DLC locked.

Then we get to the actual game, and your character is slower than an 80 year old stuck in quicksand. If you want to get anywhere, you have to pay for a DLC with vehicles, but if you dont want to pay you have to walk, which takes literal hours to get to any POIs, which are few and far between because the map is practically empty, like i know this game is about hunting but at least add SOMETHING of interest other than the occasional watchtower.

Then you finally find a deer or something, shoot it twice, you check some blood splatters and see the bleed rate is low because the deer are fucking bulletproof. and then you go after it again like an 80 year old in quicksand, and you cant even use the DLC vehicle to go after the animal because that makes to much noise.

Total scam of a game, which is a shame because it looks so good. If you do plan on buying I'd suggest getting all the 40+ DLC just so you can enjoy it for more than 5 minutes.",1698453202,1698453202,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

One of the most scenic games I have ever came across, and I truly am happy I did. Each reserve is created with detail, and each has its own astonishing, and unique features that frankly never makes this game dry in my opinion. The large database of animals you can hunt from small game like waterfowl, to big game like Bison, make this game a unique choice out of all the hunting games available on the market. 

As the well, the ease to access any reserve using multiplayer is very helpful. Before getting invested in this game, using multiplayer reserves to test out which DLC I wanted was a great way to slowly expand, but still get the experience I wanted. As well, the multiplayer itself, even though it has its fair share of bugs, is a great way to enjoy the game with friends.

To be honest, the majority of negative reviews for COTW are because of the content that is locked behind the DLC paywall. My opinion? Well yes, it's annoying initially, I think the first two base layer maps and weapons give you an idea on the game and allow you to decide if you want to further invest into it. Do I think that some DLCs should be free content with the base layer, sure. It would scare off less new players who are looking for an enjoyable time. But at the same time, the DLCs are relatively cheap, especially during sales, which I heavily suggest you take the opportunity up as DLCs become almost half the price.

Graphics wise, it's an absolutely stunning game. The environment, the animal models, I believe everything is just about perfection in this game for me. It truly makes me feel like I've been teleported to the Yukon, or that I feel and see the heat of the Vurhonga Savanna. It isn't super tolling on my PC as well, and I actually played this game comfortably on a laptop for my first year or so.

Overall, with the constant updates in content, I can confidently say this outweighs any other hunting game on the market, by a longshot. If you properly invest your time into this game, maybe invest in some DLCs, you'll experience the true beauty of the game that cannot be described by me, but rather must be experienced by yourself.",1630466074,1698199898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No matter what anyone says without a few specific ones you're going to have a terrible time with this game.

Traveling with an ATV is miserable.
The base guns are fairly meh which means you'll need some of the gun packs.

DON'T BUY THE GAME, because game have many big bugs and DEVS don't fix those. They rather develop new DLCs, which also have big bugs and after that whole game won't work.
Read discussion area.

DEVs: You guys don't understand how business works. If you underestimate customers, like you right now do, you are even more dumb I think. You don't understand, that in the players could be prospect clients, and I say to you, in my list you don't are when I look software producers.
You should look how competitors business works. Good example is take SCS Software. The care customers.



Original:
It was hard to choose do I recommend this game or not. I decide not.
The game itself is great. But.
- If you are ""busy"" person, like dad, you have to do dinner to others, drive kids to hobby (etc.) or you phone rings pretty often, you can't pause this game. I understand that you cant save it, but you cant put it even pause. So you need lot of free time when you start this game. So, if you are just get in hunting places, and some one need food from you, every things wont go so well. 
- Hunting structures. In real life, no one builds a structure where you can’t see well in everywhere. That also means, that you cant shoot well in everywhere. Fix for this is very simple: roof need to be in higher. Sometimes hunting structures also are in strange places.
- There is some coyote-missions. Problem is, that there is not lot of coyotes what you can see or even hear. So, I thinks there is some conflict, because usually this kind of mission description is some like  ""there is lot of coyotes, so they need to be hunted"".

Game is great, but most important is that you have to have time. Also, if some thinks, that this is real simulator and game simulating hunting well and you can't save game in real life hunting and my opinion is sh*t (what it is probably are), I just  like you wonder, why all animals are all time in mating, but you haven't ever seen calfs.",1617357227,1697797909,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll leave my old review below this one, just so you can see my previous opinion of the game. Not every issue I talked about is resolved yet, and the developers are still extremely slow pushing out bug fixes (the stuttering scope bug when holding your breath is still not fixed after about 2-3 years, and I even reported it and talked to a developer about the issue), but it's better than before. The game is playable now. The recent changes to the game have been mostly positive and so were the content patches. I'm having fun playing this again, so I guess that speaks for itself. I used to simply be frustrated all the time. The game is good now. Let's hope it stays that way.

Here's my old review in case you want to read it. It was a negative one:

---

I love this game, I really do. When everything works, it's the most amazing and most immersive experience I've ever had in a video game. It's both relaxing and exciting at the same time, and there's infinite replay value. The atmosphere is amazing, the graphics are great, the animal AI is great, the weapons are great, it's all great.

So why do I not recommend this game then? Because nothing actually works. It's a giant buggy mess with incompetent developers that are either too lazy or don't care to fix their game. The game is not complex at all (it's not like it's an MMO or something). You walk around some terrain, you shoot animals and you collect the rewards. That's about it. Yet every aspect of this contains at least one or more bugs. You want to change scopes? Bugged. You want to zoom in? Camera stutter. You want to walk through bushes? The sound persists after you leave the bush. You want to look through the binoculars? Have fun with 0,00001 mouse sensitivity, because the devs don't know how to implement zoom scaling. You want to ride on the ATV in the dark? Lights don't work.

Some bugs have been in the game for months or even years. Every new patch they release, introduces more bugs that are never resolved, unless we're extremely lucky. Reports do nothing, the devs acknowledge nothing.

And it's not just the bugs, the game just isn't polished. From the lack of zoom scaling, to the messy interface and interactions with the world map, it just feels so rushed and poorly developed. It's just bad, sooo bad. And I really want to love this game, but nowadays I'm just more frustrated than anything. And that is really, really unfortunate.",1618933446,1697737290,True,0,0,0.577426433563232422,0,True,False,False

But it's REALLY hard to recommend it currently, since nearly every update is a paid DLC, like a reserve/map, a weapon pack, cosmetic pack, etc. Which all costs real money and adds up quickly. There's no way to unlock any of it for free either, which their old game theHunter Classic actually allowed you to do (once they started making this game and abandoned Classic lol)

They also make you pay to use ATV's (or quads), which are the only way you can traverse the huge maps quickly without walking. I will mention that you CAN play on the new maps for free whenever they release, but you can't do missions, buy weapons that come with the reserve, or host servers on those maps.

So basically if you don't pay any money for DLC's, you just have the base game content to do and that's pretty much it, unless you want to hunt animals on the DLC reserves which can be sorta fun but there's no actual progression or stuff to unlock at that point. Currently I would recommend picking this up on sale, but just keep in mind that most of the content is locked behind paid DLC.",1593521169,1697385214,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've ever been hunting or actually know a thing a two about guns you'll figure out pretty quickly that there are some serious flaws, as I go hunting every year. I'll get the ""bad"" stuff outta the way first then dive into the good stuff, because it is still an immensely enjoyable game despite those flaws. The game for me has went from a hunting simulator to, depending on my mood, a Rambo simulator or a game to relax to.

Cons: 
I've returned to edit the review as I've now got more time under the ol' belt.

-The ballistics aren't as awful as I initially thought they were. Are they perfect? No, they're not too bad but can be annoying at times so it's a small con. Unless you get charged by anything threatening and you clap the gal in the forehead with a .338 rifle and it shrugs it off. Then it's a big problem, but that's not even remotely a deal breaker.

- Animations get weird at times, there are bugs from time to time that get annoying but, on the other hand, can be hilarious. Put an ATV at the bottom of the tall bridge in Yukon Valley and jump down on top of it from that height, you'll see what I mean as you enter orbit.

Pros:

- It's gorgeous, all of the effects and environments look spectacular at times and really make the game a treat to look at.

- It sounds wonderful, the music, the gunshots, the animals, environmental sounds, all are great and make it very easy to get lost in and explore for hours.

- It's funny, there's nothing quite like sneaking up on a fox with an enormous rifle and blasting it from 20 yards out just to watch it roll along the ground from the force of the impact.

- It's satisfying, due to the relatively bad ballistics mentioned earlier, animals will typically run for quite some time if you shoot them from any sort of range past 175 yards, which can make tracking them extremely enjoyable as you look for the monster of a Buffalo you shot while crawling around in the underbrush. It's nice to finally roll up on the kill and be reminded that yes, you truly are the god of the forest in this game.

- Rambo, when feeling aggressive the world is your stomping ground. Buy 100 shells and shoot literally everything. I've found bodies that I didn't even know I'd shot as I stomp my way through the forest, laying waste to all who stand before me like Pol Pot on a cocaine binge. Definitely a good time.

Unlocking the maps by visiting all the way points (ala Assassins Creed or Zelda BOTW/TOTK) creates a compelling narrative structure that gives you a reason to explore and hunt along the way. The environments are an absolute pleasure to experience as well. Great sound design, atmosphere, and attention to detail.

If you are looking for a realistic simulator then maybe this is not exactly the game you are hoping for.

A lot of the higher level gameplay revolves around grinding need zones as efficiently as possible, to where you will end up killing hundreds of animals in a session. The upsides to this are it makes the game depend a lot less on your patience, since you always know where and when to be to get your herds, and also it's pretty easy to do and casual players shouldn't have a hard time getting cool trophies. However if you don't play this way, it will probably take an eternity to find diamonds or rare furs in singleplayer, and you may as well give up on ever seeing a GO. 

So although theres other things to do like explore and do missions and stuff, you aren't going to get the full gameplay experience without at least a bit of grinding.

Having only been hunting a number of times I'd say it does a very good job at being realistic in the detection system and AI.,1696697125,1696697125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Male/Female Ratios: They used to be 50/50. Now males, the diamond producers for most species, are 25 percent or worse, especially among birds. In nature, that just doesn't happen. Result? Diamonds are harder to get.

2. Waterfowl used to be in the water. Now they hide behind trees, and lie in long grass. Yep, they eat worms, I guess. Result? Diamonds are harder to get.

3. Gunshot noise was increased. It used to be 200 meters. Now it's 270. So everything spooks in every direction. Result? Diamonds are harder to get.

4. Spook speed was increased. It used to be that antlered species would take a couple of seconds after hearing a shot to orient themselves and then run. Now they run instantly. No more multiple harvests from the same herd. Same with all the other species. And waterfowl spook like bullets. Result? Yep. Diamonds are harder to get.

5. Spook distance was increased. When animals ran from a shot, they used to return within a reasonable time. Now, they run, run, run. Faaaar away. Often, never to return. Result? Your guessed it. Diamonds are grindier than ever.

6. Wounded game take forever to go down. If you're an ethical hunter, you chase a wounded animal until you find it or it stops bleeding. Wounded animals now run more than twice the distance they used to. So while you're wasting time chasing 50 bloodspots, yep: Diamonds are harder to get.

7. The noise you make is now louder. Crawling on your belly used to make 25 meters of noise. Now it's 50. Every form of movement has had its noise distance increased by 25. Diamonds are already hard to get, but it's worse still...

8. Animals are more sensitive to your noise. Used to be you could crawl to within 10 meters of your game, in spite of the 25 meters of noise you were making. Now, a crouch walk, supposedly 75 meters of noise, will alert deer 100 meters away. Anyone wish they could get more diamonds?

9. Maximum level game now produces far more trolls. The level 3 deer, the level 5 moose and the level 9 water buffalo love to troll. It started with feral goats. One level 5 goat in 10 might produce a diamond when they were introduced on Te Awaroa. Now all the species have been tainted with higher troll percentages. Any guess how this affects your future diamond collection?

10. Herds have been reduced. One of the most exciting things about Vurhonga's wildebeests was that they used to thunder around the African prairie in herds of 30 or more. Whitetail used to have as many as 15 in a herd. Ducks used to pool in groups of 40. Divide all those numbers by four now. Smaller herds? Less diamonds.

11. Calls are less effective. Fox used to love a good rabbit squeal. Now they're meh. One of the toughest diamonds in the game -- just got tougher.

12. And here's the worst nerf of them all: Entire map populations have been decimated. Maps used to sport 1500+ animals at any given time. Best guess is that maps now only have 600 animals wandering in their lonely circles. All in an effort to make the game more playable for computers that are 15 years old. Guess what? As someone who has harvested 64000 animals on this game, including 16000 golds and 400 diamonds -- it's not about the diamonds anymore. It's about the Great Ones. Having harvested 2 before the changes listed above, I was loving this game. Now, it's just a miserable, boring, ripped off shadow of the great game it used to be.

I'm done here. Devs who don't understand the power of frequent rewards in a game, don't understand how games work. I'll no longer reward them with my time or money.







I have experienced many iterations of this game, and the changes always include some major bugs -- the latest update nixed the bloodhound DLC.

But those eventually get fixed. So you make the adjustment, and wait three months for the next update.

What kills this game for me are the changes for change sake that do not enhance the game. Those never get fixed.

At one point in the past, waterfowl re-spawned consistently, so you'd have fresh new targets all the time. Now the only way you can get fresh re-spawns? Kill the entire flock. Otherwise the same old leftovers constantly fly around your entire map, the exact same flock reappearing when you fast travel to other locations in hopes of finding fresh birds.

It used to be that waterfowl were 50/50 in their gender split. Males are the real prize. Now they've nerfed that split to 20/80. Shoot two males, and now you've got 8 females forever flying the skies, attracting nothing but scorn because they'll never score diamond. Considering that Canadian geese mate for life, I'm guessing the ratio is more like 50/50 in real life. And for the life of me I can't figure out: Why the nerf?

Whitetail used to pause and orient themselves after hearing a shot, giving you a chance to get a second shot in for another deer. Now they insta-spook. Every encounter is now a one shot experience, which means way more running around the map, picking up one harvest at a time. Gone is the thrill of a second quick accurate shot. That one for me is a game killer.

Gun noise distance used to be 200m. That's the range at which animals run away when you pull the trigger.  Now they've increased it to 270m. Why? To make the game harder? Or more realistic, in some developer's mind? As a hunter in real life, I find the change debatable. As a gamer, the game is just less fun now.

The game, for certain species, used to have a variety of fur types. Used to be fun collecting trophies in the all the colors they came in. Now? They've nerfed those colors down to just a handful. I'm guessing all those colors were plugging up processor bandwidth. Not sure how.

Ducks used to be fun to hunt with a shotgun. On a good encounter, you could bag 5 or 6 with a shotgun. Now those little mallard fly like bullets -- no where close to real life. You need to be real good just to get two. What used to be fun is just plain boring now. I've resorted to hunting them at 200 meters with a .22. I'm guessing I'll have to hunt at 250m now, with the augmented gun noise change.

I could go on, but instead...I'll just move on. I'll check into COTW every once in a while in the future. Maybe the developers will rediscover what really made this game great in the past.

But for now, after 62000 harvests and 388 diamonds,  I'll wave a sad goodbye.",1670333418,1696613300,False,10,0,0.535611212253570557,0,True,False,False

You wanna get places faster in a vehicle? That'll be $7. Wanna have tree blinds, or tents? More money. A dog? may as well open up the ol wallet again... the amount of money you need to spend in order to feel like you can enjoy the game is a really high entry barrier that isn't worth broaching. Money aside, there are some factors that are even worse...

Never have I ever had a deer hear a twig snap 300 ft away and bolt away like it was an emergency. I have nearly hit sooooo many with a car IRL, walked up on dozens, my dog has pooped with one 20 feet away, totally oblivious. Turkeys running if you stand up ever so briefly? yeah right, again I have walked up on these critters IRL and they DO NOT CARE. Everything runs away at the first sign of trouble, no matter how hard you sneak, descent, and take your time. you have to level by doing missions to become sneakier I guess, which is really annoying because it requires HUNTING to LEVEL and I can't get within 100 YARDS OF ANYTHING WITH EARS. Your best bets are to shell out for a hunting stand and wait FOREVER, or try to flush animals toward your friends so they can pretend it's an arcade shooter and take all the kill credit while you run around like an idiot.

weapons are unrealistic. You mean to tell me if I shot a lion in the liver or eyeball with a slightly too small caliber bullet, it's just gonna maul me? I LEGIT PEPPERED a lion with 223 rounds in the face, and it had plenty of time to sprint around the lake, roar at me, and rip my face off only for my friend to kill it and be bummed it was full of holes.

I bought this hoping it would be the like old cabela's games, I was severely disappointed and refuse to spend a bunch of time grinding and even more money just to reach a base line of playable. If there was a way to get better without dedicated real life amounts of time for hunting, this game might be worthwhile, but currently, it's a grind and cash grab more than a hunting game.

Never kinda understood why some one would want a hunting sim. Saw this one on big sale and thought: ""Oh what the heck. I'll give it a shot."" So, now I have all the dlc and almost 700h of playtime...

The maps are nice and varied, and some places are down right beautiful. Some issues here and there, but it's the common stuff most mainly procedurally generated maps have. The soundscape.... Oh man the soundscape. It's spot on. I don't even care to guess how much of my life I've spent in the great outdoors, but that's the good stuff. After the map (Revontuli Coast) based on Finland (where I live) came out, I noticed that in many places the surroundings were pretty perfect, but in others things were.... wrong. Like an island bordering the open sea had the long smooth rocky side towards the mainland, and the side with trees coming almost to the waterline towards the horizon. It was the wrong way around. I've talked with others from places the maps are based on, and they have similar experiences.

Shooting's pretty decent. You have bullet drop and drag, and wind affects the trajectories in a reasonable manner. A good deal of the organs inside the animals are modelled so that hits in different parts have different effects. Double lungshot and the animal either drops right down, or gets a short distance before the blood loss and shock drops it. Get a flesh wound on a water buffalo, and you can track those blood drops til the end of time. Rifles and pistols have generally two types of ammo, one that does shock and a wide wound channel but loses penetration fast, and a penetration focused that does the opposite. Both tend to have their uses. Bows and x-bows have different draw strengths, that combined with the weight of the arrows or bolts affect the shot. Shotguns come in different gauges (10, 12, 16 and 20) and bird-, and buckshots and slugs.

I think the gamification of hunting is quite decently done. You have those slow times when it feels nothing happens, and then ones where you get a lot of game. Still, you get stuff done at a comfortable rate without much of a hassle. Portable hunting structures (various blinds mostly) and tents etc give some variation and utility. Lures (sound and scent), wind, ambient sound level, terrain and vegetation all play into the sneaking part, as well as the senses of the particular animals around. The story missions are mainly for easy cash and xp for those starting out, and give some ambience. Do them or don't. Nothing's forced.

I think that's the main gist of it. I find Hunter: CotW really relaxing and a good way to get that light nature ""fix"" if I can't get the real thing. ;)",1696529567,1696529567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Verdict: The landscapes and wildlife are okay. However, the content is poor in essential gameplay areas. The rigid, heavily stalled unlock system, which is modeled on annoying purchase processes, initially prevents the player from experiencing this quickly. Then, however, it turns out that the game lacks the flexibility, depth of play and attention to detail in weapons, animation and player character that would guarantee actual game satisfaction. The lack of bugfixing for years, so to speak, also contributes very negatively to the game's overall image.

Note: This game is unfortunately not just about hunting and nature and having fun. This game is also about conditioning economic processes and worldly attitudes (making money and spending money). It is about promoting an atmosphere of prosperity, globalization and consumption. The missions are on the level of school field trips for 12 year olds. This gives the game an annoying, cautionary aura. This is the main reason for not recommending it.

----------------------------

Fazit: Die Landschaften und die Tierwelt des Spiels sind in Ordnung. Die Inhalte sind jedoch in wesentlichen Spielbereichen dürftig. Das starre, stark hinhaltende, an nervigen Kaufprozessen angelehnte Freischaltsystem verhindert zunächst, dass der Spieler dies schnell erfährt. Dann stellt sich jedoch heraus, dass es dem Spiel an der Flexibilität, Spieltiefe und an Detailtreue bei Waffen, Animation und Spielerfigur fehlt, die tatsächliche  Spielzufriedenheit garantieren würden. Auch das quasi seit Jahren fehlendes Bugfixing trägt sehr negativ zum Gesamtbild des Spieles bei.

Anmerkung: In diesem Spiel geht es leider nicht nur um Jagd und Natur und den Spaß an der Sache. In diesem Spiel geht es auch darum wirtschaftliche Abläufe und weltanschauliche Haltungen zu konditionieren (Geld zu verdienen und Geld auszugeben). Es geht darum eine Atmosphäre der Prosperität, Globalisierung und des Konsums zu fördern. Die Missionen bewegen sich auf dem Niveau von Schulausflügen für 12 Jährige. Dadurch erhält das Spiel eine nervende, belehrende Aura. Dies ist der Hauptgrund der nicht Empfehlung.

On top of this they apparently released an update that made animals spook at an even closer distance. For most players who are fine with crouch walking for 5 hours a day, this is just an additional challenge. The realism is fine, but at some point it gets ridiculous. I've seen countless animals spook at 400m while sitting still.

The game is beautiful and it can be enjoyable, but as you learn it you realize that the mechanics are designed so that you must ""herd manage"" which involves many many hours of culling animals you don't want in a very complex way that even the experts don't fully understand just to spawn a rare.

It's also a bit of a disappointment that one feature of the game such as tree stands/blinds isn't really a usable feature, meaning you're never going to be able to just sit in one and possibly get lucky with a rare walking by even if you are there during proper feed times or in the correct need zone. Tents are spawn points and stands/blinds are for example only there to reduce the amount of suppression you get for a kill.

That is the number that represents how many times this game has refused to close and causing me to have to force my PC to shut down. Then when I log back into the game, I've lost nearly an entire days worth of progress. Most recently 3 levels of progression, nearly all of the rest of my missions in hirsch and the full map discovery of Fernando. My desire to play the game is dropping massively because of this. It is extremely deflating to play a game for a whole day and then it doesn't save properly or the game doesn't close right and you lose the entire days worth of progress. Honestly, I don't know if I'd actually recommend the game to others.


Edit: Thanks to literally NO ONE WHATSOEVER... I've found the fix. You need to turn off the cloud save if you are having this issue. Additionally you need to close the game via the main menu rather than ALT+F4 or exiting to desktop. Apart from that the game is perfectly fine and enjoyable.

Edit 2023: New issues galore! Cant play for more that 30 minutes without the game crashing. Been sending reports with request for the devs to email me with more information... been three weeks and NOT A SINGLE EMAIL. There is no crash report with real information in it. there is no error message or crash number. There are literally zero indication as to what could even possibly be causing the crashes so that i can attempt to fix the problem. Ive tried to implement a number of fixes but none have worked.

Spelet är rent av vackert med sina miljöer. Jag kan verkligen rekommendera Hirschfelden med sina vackra höstfärger och den levande naturen. Du kan skjuta allt från harar till bisonoxar.
Kan även rekommendera Yukon med sia vackra fjällandskap och väderförändringar så som snön som färgar marken vit.

The game is beautiful with its scenery and variants of animals and sizes. From the shot placements, to the equipment, this game delivers a wonderful experience of both visual and audio that engage the audience and enhance your experience through well planned missions. The variety of maps, creatures, and equipment, all provide an overall sensation of a proper hunt. The different elements of wolves attacking to snow covering the surrounding region is honestly breathtaking.

I may have only 50ish hours in the game but I can feel there are plenty more to come with my trophy hunting and lodge setups. Thank you developers for making such a fantastic game and I love this game!

This could affect your outcome on if you buy the game or not, original review below

I have 300+ hours on this game on my xbox. The game itself, (hunting, weapons, the map, etc) is great. Stealth is well developed, animals act well, and it's fun to play. If you see reviews claiming the game is ""boring"" because they couldn't find any animals after running around for 30 minutes it's because they were playing it wrong. This game REQUIRES patience, so if that's in short supply, look elsewhere. Granted, if you just want to run around and shoot animals, this game is extremely boring, however if you enjoy taking things slowly, trying to place a perfect shot, following animals, etc, this game is great. The game was originally released unfinished. Nowadays it's pretty stable and the graphics look great if you can play on high settings. However, what makes this review negative, and many other reviews too, is that DLC spam is insane. 100+ dollars worth of dlc? It's fucked. Half of the DLC are things that SHOULD be in the PAYED GAME. Half the maps, over 40 guns, night optics, many species, lodges, tents??? One of the things that specifically aggravates me are the quads. Sure, they're not that expensive, around 4 dollars, but 4 dollars for something that 100% should and needs to be in the non-dlc game? The maps are huge and when I played on xbox and didn't have dlc it took literal hours to unlock all the lodges and vantage points. They're not needed but if you don't find them you're kinda just fucked. Truly, how much DLC does one game need? This is EA levels of little goblin cashgrabs. I can't recommend buying this game simply because the publishers don't deserve any more money.",1690859790,1695654527,False,40,1,0.703251123428344727,0,True,False,False

Every five minutes a bloodthirsty German noble calls me and directs me to murder and “harvest” wildlife like I’m in some horrible horror movie. Really harshes my buzz. 

As a hunting simulator, it’s pretty great, I guess? Animal behaviour is complex, wind and scent and sound are richly simulated, bullet travel matters. 

I think it’s great that a game finally acknowledges headshots aren’t everything. If only a few more FPSs would follow suit.

Anyway, if you like hunting, this is probably great. If you don’t like hunting and just want a beautiful hiking simulator, maybe look elsewhere.

This is a reasonably good game at what I consider to be a reasonable price, however it is just not something I can find enjoyable. I played this game for a short time and then watched my gf try to get a bunch of achievements, but anyone claiming that it is only an issue of patience is not thinking straight.

The game is very realistic in many aspects, including that hunting is incredibly slow and includes a lot of sitting still, but it is also very 'gamey' in other aspects, such as starting you out with garbage equipment so that there can be a progression system, giving animals super powers (real animals would be constantly fleeing if they were somehow able to recognize a twig snapping 500m away as a threat, and I don't think tanking a shotgun blast to the head and running several kilometres away is possible either) and sacrificing basic touches like an animation for a door opening in order to pump out more maps.

The bugginess is moderate-low, animals sometimes teleport and shot paths are not accurate somewhat often, but nothing super game breaking. No crashes if I remember right.

Some other reviews mention DLC spam, this is correct. The DLC quad bike is absolutely required for the base game, you are forced to trek across massive maps, which look largely the same across the area, with a character who seems to have broken legs (I know he/she's carrying a lot of equipment, but it still feels bad). The base game and quad bike are both not too expensive, but making something so important into a DLC is just bad on principle.

Completionists beware, you will probably suffer an aneurysm before getting 100% achievements.",1695389254,1695389254,False,5,0,0.497875511646270752,0,True,False,False

The Achilles heel appears to be stat tracking and server management. I've killed the Valuez Werecoyote 3 times now. Still have the mission...does not show in my hunter log. The Angler is also experiencing the same issue, and is not worth playing currently.

Another note is the guns for level 2 and 3 animals (even after the 22-250 and *supposedly* buffed .223). There is no penetration on these rounds at all. I've lost countless grades due to a round that should have 100% reached vitals but fell short, its nonsense. It's almost like these folks have never put their hands on a firearm...

The Developers need to hire people who know how to deal with these problems, because they are infuriating to play right now. 

I hope they figure it out to make these games worth playing - is the nicest thing I can say right now.

Also, discussions need to be re-opened. Its not cool, nor should it be 'OK'  to block us out here. 
*this was my B, I guess I didn't realize how discussions worked. it seemed like I had to have some kind of status to start a topic/thread*

**Update: The server issues have been resolved, and changed my recommendation to YES because of that alone. I've also received a response from a Dev that they will look into the penetration for level 2 and 3 firearms. I hope they just change them to work in the same respective way that a level 4-8 works on it's intended targets.

This is the first hunting game I've ever played and I've been enjoying it a lot, even with the annoying bugs that are not getting fixed as quickly as they should be. I like doing the missions as they challenge me to do things I maybe otherwise wouldn't be keen on trying. Unfortunately, many missions are bugged as are some achievements. There are other issues in the game as well, but I just tend to avoid things that I have noticed causing problems. Not the optimal solution, but I play this to relax, so I try not to be bothered.

I don't generally like shooting games, because I lack the quick reflexes they require, but this is as slow paced as you want it to be. Quick reflexes are rarely needed, and even if you're slow and do get trampled by a buffalo, you just get transported back to the nearest outpost, so it is an annoyance at the most.

I have bought all of the reserves so far, and some of them are more interesting than others, but I don't regret getting them. I have a bunch of other DLCs as well, like the ATV, tents, stands, and several gun packs. You can play the game with just the base game, but the DLCs definitely make it better. Just do your research to determine, which ones you want, and wait for a sale.

In game animal populations are high, and the game does not tell you where all the animals are.  You can literally hunt as long or as short as you want.  The initial grind is a bit heavy, but theres a lot of open hunting.  Shoot what you want when you want.  Definitely not a COD type shoot em up, if you run through the map you wont see anything.

Pros:
Completely open world, beautiful graphics
Somewhat realistic physics, bullets have definite properties.  dont try shooting a moose with your default gun.
everything purchased with in game credits
shoot what you want when you want
no licenses
update - now has small game hunting, defintely worth purchasing
Some animals will actively hunt you on some of the new maps, which is a refreshing changeup

Cons:
A little too grindy.  have to shoot pretty much everything you see in the beginning.
animals still get stuck in random spots, though this has been greatly improved.


Overall the best hunting game ive ever played.  Definitely worth the purchase.

Review update:
The major issues from the past are gone, and there are ways with the DLC to pretty much turn the game into a shooting gallery as well.  Which is actually necessary if you ever wish to harvest a super rare or a great one.  The new Te Arowa And Austrailia reserves are phenomenal.  Lots of open terrain so you can see stuff for hundreds of yards away.

Def a must buy if you like any sort of hunting game.",1506284159,1694637811,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
