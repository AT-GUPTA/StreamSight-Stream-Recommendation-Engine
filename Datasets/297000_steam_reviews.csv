Firstly, the game is locked to 30fps (can be unlocked with external tools but for a HD edition it shouldn't be locked at all). Secondly, it's missing a lot of content, it doesn't have any of the expansions that were published after the original release.

For a better experience with HoMM3 I recommend buying the Complete Edition from GOG (it's $10) or you can just pirate it. After that you can download the HD launcher and play the game like that. You can use GameRanger if you want to play online with stranger or with friends.

The community of the game made some expansions (they all require the Complete Edition of the game).
1) Horn of the Abyss (HotA): The best expansion in my opinion. It's more like a continuation to the original game, everything that is added feels like it's from the original game. The expansion adds a new campaign , 2 new towns, some heroes and more map objectives. You can also use the HD launcher to play HotA. The HotA expansion has an online mode and there are like 2-3k players online almost all the time (there is also a ranked system).
HotA discord: https://discord.com/invite/horn-of-the-abyss-519540110195425280

2) In the Wake of Gods (WoG): This expansion is for the people that enjoy modding the game. You can use the ERA launcher to play it. There are tons of mods out there, one mod i really liked was the 3rd upgrade mod but you can add anything from town to heroes, creatures, artifacts, etc. In the ERA launcher there are some other options , I have no idea what they are but I think you can create your own mods there. The WoG expansion also had it's own campaign though some time ago it was bugged and you needed to download it from somewhere else, idk if that is still the case. The online is kinda dead, but you can still play with friends if you want to. This one is open-source if you want to help the community out.

3) Master of Puppets (MoP): I've never played this one so I don't know a lot about it but as the other expansions it adds creatures, artifacts and other stuff.

Unfortunately I couldn't find the discord of the other 2 expansions but a good site to find information about each mod is https://heroes3wog.net/ .

To sum it up if you want to play the original game just buy the Complete edition and play it with the HD launcher and if you want to try something new you can try the expansions listed above (I think there are more expansions out there but these 3 are the biggest ones). Even after more than 20 years after the release of the game people still make content for it so you can't really get bored with it.

From its intricate gameplay mechanics to its beautifully crafted fantasy world, this game captures the essence of what makes strategy gaming so compelling.

The game's strategic depth is unparalleled, with a rich blend of tactical combat and resource management. Players must think several steps ahead, balancing the growth of their towns with the development of their armies. Each choice feels impactful, whether it's deciding which skills to enhance or which territories to conquer. The variety of factions, each with its unique units and abilities, adds to the game's replay value, encouraging experimentation and diverse strategies.

Furthermore, the turn-based combat system is a masterclass in design. It requires careful positioning, foresight, and the ability to adapt to ever-changing battlefield conditions. The game also shines in its multiplayer aspect, providing thrilling and challenging experiences against both AI and human opponents.

Graphically, Heroes of Might and Magic III is a feast for the eyes, with its detailed sprites and vibrant, colorful world. The game’s soundtrack is equally impressive, featuring an array of captivating melodies that perfectly complement the fantasy setting.

In conclusion, Heroes of Might and Magic III is not just the best strategy game I've ever played, but it also stands as a benchmark in the genre. Its combination of strategic depth, engaging combat, and artistic beauty creates an experience that is as rewarding today as it was at its release.",1704148758,1704148758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It cost me £3.12 Which is about $4US and it plays a little differently from HoMIII HD edition. Some of the rules that were altered in HD are as original in this.
Yes - the rule changes for HD were almost all for the better overall, but sometimes you want to play as it was 24 years ago for nostalgia or to do some ""what if"" type stuff.
For under 5 bucks - this was worth it for me.
Also if you are a complete beginner, the campaign seems a lot easier that it was int he original.  I get not many people will be coming to this for the first time, so this is likely not a consideration for many. But if you are, I'm sure this version is a lot more beginner friendly. You can move and win the first few stages of the campaign with your eyes shut - learning the nuances of the rules in a more forgiving way.

Upgrading your Village/Town/City Hall into a Capitol should usually be your first priority for the income boost. Some exceptions exist though, for example Tower and Conflux benefit from upgrading their 1st level creature dwellings even as early as day 1 as the upgraded versions of those creatures (Master Gremlins and Sprites respectively) are far stronger and make early fights much easier.
Once you know what you're doing, aiming for certain higher-level creature dwellings to start producing them early can also be worth it. Stronghold for example can produce a Behemoth Lair very quickly provided you have the resources.
Consider hiring a second hero from your town's Tavern on the first day. Not only can you add their starting troops to your main army, but you can use the secondary hero to pick up resources, transport troops, grab weekly creatures/resources and so forth while your main hero focuses on exploring and fighting enemies. Later having a chain of multiple heroes for troop transportation will likewise help reduce wasting time on your main army.
A handful of heroes start with a powerful high-level spell at level 1, such as Tower's Solmyr (Chain Lightning), Dungeon's Jeddite (Resurrection) and Necropolis' Aislinn (Meteor Shower). These can be advantageous all throughout the game. Some heroes also produce free gold or resources, making them useful secondary heroes even if they never fight a single battle.
Marketplaces offer terrible value at the beginning but the more of them you own, the better the deals you get. Exchanging less useful resources for valuable ones even at bad rates can be worthwhile though, especially for building high-level creature dwellings early.


Adventure Map

Pressing the Space key lets you re-visit a location your hero is currently standing on.
The creature with the lowest Speed stat in a hero's army determines how many movement points that hero has available on the adventure map. Very slow creatures such as Walking Dead or Dwarves are best left home on long journeys.
Certain terrains also cause movement penalties, namely Rough (25%), Sand (50%), Snow (50%) and Swamp (75%). The Pathfinding skill reduces or eliminates these penalties.
Each creature also has ""native"" terrain on which they suffer no movement penalties, and they even gain a minor bonus in battles taking place on that terrain. For example an army consisting (solely) of creatures from the swamp-dwelling Fortress town can move on Swamp terrain without suffering the normal 75% penalty to movement point costs.


Combat

The Speed stat determines both movement distance and turn order, making Slow arguably the best combat spell in the game despite being 1st level. A hero with Expert Earth Magic can cripple entire armies with a single cast of Slow.
Otherwise devastating ranged units are very weak in melee unless they have the ""No melee penalty"" ability, so getting your melee units next to enemy ranged units is very important. Most ranged units also deal reduced damage from long range and when attacking from the outside of city walls
AI heroes will usually try to run away when losing a fight, often with a ""parting gift"" in the form of a Lightning Bolt to your weakest stack. When your enemy is starting to be low on troops in a fight, do your best to wipe them out in a single assault that doesn't give them a chance to flee.


Miscellaneous

A town with a Mage Guild will fully replenish the Spell Points of any hero who ends their turn there at the beginning of their next turn. Also, a hero without a Spell Book can buy one by visiting a Mage Guild.
Having Expert skill in a magic school often greatly amplifies the power of spells belonging to that school, most notably causing most status effects to apply to entire armies rather than individual units.
In campaigns where your hero carries over from one scenario to the next, it's worth getting as many permanent attribute boosts and spells as possible before finishing the current scenario as they will carry over as well. Artifacts will not carry over, some plot-specific ones notwithstanding.


Some secondary skills are more useful than others. The following is a rough order of usefulness, but it's by no means absolute as opinions vary and for example Archery's value depends entirely on how many ranged units you have.

GREAT - Air Magic, Earth Magic, Logistics, Offense, Wisdom, Necromancy (Necropolis only)
GOOD - Archery, Armorer, Intelligence, Water Magic, Diplomacy (GREAT if you get it very early, BAD if you get it very late)
USEFUL - Luck, Tactics, Fire Magic (GREAT if you have the powerful Berserk spell)
SITUATIONAL - Navigation (Valuable on water-heavy maps), Pathfinding (Valuable on maps with lots of harsh terrain), Leadership (Valuable if your army has creatures from many different factions)
BAD - Artillery, Ballistics, Mysticism, Resistance, Scholar, Scouting, Sorcery, Estates (USEFUL on secondary non-combat heroes)
TERRIBLE - Eagle Eye, First Aid, Learning

Of the expansions i really only wanted armageddon's blade.
Map generator i can live with out half the maps it made i found where just unplayable i prefer fan made maps anyway release a map pack for it charge $15 for it. Cod games can do it.

I want alpha centuari on steam or even red alert 1 or 2. EA Sigh...

Just be happy its still around :)


About game so far while playing:

- Mouse cursor laggy in HD. SD is fine.
- Display of play screen is off centre.
- Blah can't seem to re-vist mines, creature dwelling etc... with spacebar.
- Overall display is better. Creatures, towns etc.
- AI appears the same.
- Multiplayer for me is buggy ''out of sync with players who join my games'' but can join others fine at moment.
- Game has not crashed yet for any reason.(Homm3 Complete crashed alot in multiplayer for me)",1422720529,1700988543,True,5,2,0.532296895980834961,2,True,False,False

I recently delved back into the magical world of Heroes® of Might & Magic® III, and I must say that the HD Edition has truly enhanced my nostalgic experience. Here are ten reasons why I believe this edition is a gem:

1) Timeless Gameplay: The strategic and turn-based gameplay remains as captivating as ever, standing the test of time.

2) Enhanced Graphics: While retaining the classic charm, the HD Edition boasts improved graphics that beautifully preserve the essence of the original.

3) Memorable Soundtrack: The unforgettable soundtrack takes me on a journey down memory lane, perfectly capturing the spirit of the game.

4) Rich Storyline: The captivating narrative and diverse factions make every playthrough a unique adventure, just like in my childhood days.

5) Tactical Depth: The depth of strategy involved in building armies, capturing cities, and exploring the map continues to provide a satisfying challenge.

6) Heroes with Personality: Each hero has their own quirks and abilities, adding a personal touch to the gameplay.

7) Expansive Maps: The vast and intricately designed maps provide endless possibilities and keep the exploration exciting.

8) Multiplayer Magic: The multiplayer mode, a staple of the original, remains a fantastic way to challenge friends and relive the competitive spirit of the past.

9) User-Friendly Interface: The updated interface makes navigation smoother, making it easier to focus on the strategic aspects of the game.

10) Community Support: The active community and modding scene keep the game alive and introduce fresh content, ensuring that the Heroes® of Might & Magic® III legacy lives on.

Having played the original version in my childhood, the HD Edition has not only brought back fond memories but has also added a layer of refinement that enhances the overall experience. It's like revisiting an old friend and discovering new facets of their personality.

In the realm of Ubisoft games, Heroes® of Might & Magic® III - HD Edition stands out as a shining example of a successful endeavor. One might even say it's a rare gem amidst the sea of Ubisoft titles, and the sarcasm is evident when considering the company's mixed track record. However, with Heroes® of Might & Magic® III - HD Edition, Ubisoft has truly captured the magic of the original and delivered a product that pays homage to a classic while catering to the demands of the modern gamer. It's a testament to the fact that, sometimes, the best way forward is to revisit and revitalize the past.",1699829353,1699829448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's 15 Canadian and you can get the Complete game with both DLC for 13.50 on Ubisofts store. There's a free HD addon that is actually better ""HD"" than this ""HD Edition"". Plus you'll have the two DLCs as well as access to large modpacks that are essentially more impactful than the DLC. The modpacks are *not* compatible with this broken half version of HOMM3. 

The fact that they're selling an incomplete product of a 24 year old game for more than their competition is shameful. 

There's zero reason for anyone to see this and assume that the DLC of a 24 year old game would not be included. We're talking a QUARTER OF A CENTURY. There's no excuse. 

Threw 15$ down the drain because you can't even buy the DLC on Steam. So now I have to buy this 24 year old game, for the third time. Awesome.

Great game though, but screw Steam and screw the publishers that chose to not include the DLC. 

I would wager half the people that bought it on Steam ended up buying it on another platform that ACTUALLY INCLUDES THE ENTIRE GAME.

So to summarize, buy it anywhere else for cheaper than on Steam and get the actual full version of the game. Then you can get a HD addon for free, that runs better, and allows you to also use the popular mods for the game that include an online lobby reminiscent of Battle.Net back in the day with rankings. I suggest getting it from GOG myself.

Making such a legendary game accessible to a modern audience is always a good thing, but Ubisoft just didn't do enough here to set this refurbished version apart from the original and its free high-definition mod. More effort could have - and should have - been made to ensure that this would be the definitive and complete game that all fans of the series would love to have. As much as I adore this trip back in time, I would recommend that anyone else interested in the same sort of fantasy journey buy it in a different and cheaper store with good old games.

PROS:
✓ High-definition updates to the graphics 
✓ Excellent multiplayer support makes a big difference 
✓ At least fifty single-player maps to play
✓ Best game of the whole series to date (not this version tho)
✓ Story is a bit more interesting than the average strategy game
✓ Legendary music
✓ Hundreds of hours of extremely challenging gameplay in campaigns, scenarios, and multiplayer
✓ Is still a great, addictive game
✓ 8 Factions to play with
✓ Same great map editor

CONS:
- There are cheaper, high-def options already available
- Not the complete HOMM III experience (no expansions)
- Fan mods aren’t compatible
- Balance of the Towns aren’t perfect",1698575907,1698575907,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Honestly, this game is fantastic if you have complete version (Shadow of death and Armageddon Blade). Sadly, they lost the source codes, so most likely steam will not get expansions.

Homm3 is playable, but it is lacking. For example: very little maps, no random maps generator. Also, I don't like that sometimes when you play as Tower's faction when you get sieged your mines doesn't work. Oh yeah Factions wall's defense doesn't do damage to enemies like Castle's river, Inferno's lava. Only Tower's faction defense do damage (sometimes)... Fortress's faction is even weaker because Dragon fly doesn't have attack which do Weakness debuff to enemy... One more thing when you click too fast in the battlefield your unit can skip a turn. That's one of the annoying thing can happen (not always, but it often enough)

If you want to play this game I suggest to buy it complete version at GOG. It is cheaper and you get more stuff. New faction, units, artifacts and fan made mods which gives even more stuff (I didn't tried yet though).

HOMM3, if you don't already know it, it's a game that has not been matched even nowadays in terms of gameplay and addiction. If you have not tried it yet, you should definitely give it an opportunity.

However this ""HD"" edition, apart from some graphical rework that could be kind of ok (some Heroes portraits are terrible! -what have they done with them?!?), it has nothing to offer compared to the complete version available on GoG. It's missing lots of campaings and units (even full Conflux faction!), great features (keyboard shortcuts and UI improvements), and it has TONS of annoying bugs that could easily ruin your experience! By bugs I mean MAJOR bugs like your hero with tactics skill, doesn't get the tactics phase at the beginning of the combats, and annoying important issues like that. Add to this totally random and recurrent crashes to Desktop, that can get you totally mad if you have not saved recently in your turn.

HD mod for the Complete version of this game on GoG it's far superior and better in all aspects - it adds tons of improvements for armies management, inventory..., HotA (best mod by far) adds the possibility to play a brand new faction and Heroes (pirates) in a completely new expansion, which has amazing campaigns with great storyline, superior than the original ones, and it's completely free.

So, as said, forget about this edition of the game, go and get the Complete edition and the free HD mod instead, or the Horn of the Abyss expansion. Again, another example of how the dedicated community can do by far a massively better job than some greddy publishers.

I started out Heroes of Might and Magic III as a kid, and a pirate copy with Restoration of Erathia. I spent many hours playing the game, but I thought it was really hard, and had to use cheats to even get through the levels. Later on I managed to get a Ubisoft collection with Heroes 3 + Heroes 4 BOTH Complete editions on one DVD. This one was legit.

In 2008 I spent around 6 months trying to get through ALL of Heroes 3, which included Restoration of Erathia, Armageddons Blade and Shadows of Death (this one I tried to get for a long time before I bought the collection, but it was never in the store), including Heroes Chronicles as well. 

After almost completing everything there was without cheats (the last Shadow of Deaths campaigns were kinda hard), and overall finishing everything there was connected to Heroes of Might and Magic 3 I was sure that I would never wanna play it again. This game has been one of my all time favorites, since I was a kid, and all the way to the day today.

AFTER TLDR nostaligia section: 
I have currently almost stopped buying games on Steam, because I am trying to complete those I have bought through the years, and they have been many. For Heroes of Might and Magic 3, I probably got this when I bought some other Heroes of Might and Magic games. I've done them all from 1-7. 

It kinda triggered my interested to play Heroes 3 again, and since it was ""just"" Restoration of Erathia it was fine. It also had achievements, so I felt the game would be over when I finished those.

TO START OFF MY REVIEW. The save system of the Campaign in heroes 3 always got me, and I keep forgetting you need to make a MAIN save for the entire game and the campaigns. SIMPLY push New Game, make a save in your first Campaign level, and then use it whenever you win a level. Having some extra saves won't hurt either; for safety and maybe if you have to choose a certain way of doing things, like in the Fortress/Barbarian campaign. I don't mind doing things over again, but just in case you wanna save some time. Don't get demotivated if you have to start a level over again, because you lost. You can always try again, and do better as you learn!

The game is awesome; it feels like it always was. I didn't really care that much about the new HD graphics, but I did care that the resolution was perfect on my 1440p monitor (2560x1440). 

GAMEPLAY:
You start of with heroes, picking up resources, fighting and becoming stronger. Eventually you also learn new spells, upgrade your creatures, monsters or simply humanoids that will fight for you to the end. The game took me a lot of time to master, but I can in most cases beat any level without any problems. The way of doing this is to try to keep a balance, between how much money you get per day, and if your army is big enough to beat the enemy. If it's a small level for example, you might wanna rush your army, over money. 

The story itself is alright. You either attack or defend yourself basically (this was the way of saying it without spoiling anything), and you either win or lose. If you win you come to the next level, and the story is told via text or kind of cutscenes.

...

I spent over 100 hours on this game, after finishing my last achievement. This could easily have been more, but I really didn't have patience to play every single player level (non campaign) on all the difficulties. I simply loaded the games until the achievements popped. 

Speaking about single player and MULTIPLAYER. I loved to play Heroes 3 with friends, and you get to pick order and make names for yourself, choose a level, starting town, and even a hero with special abilities. I only played one MP game with my friend who were visiting. He had never played it before, but he understood and learnt the basics of the game pretty easily.

ANYWAY! I would totally recommend Heroes of Might and Magic 3 HD, BUT (!), if you really wanna go in depths in the Heroes of Might and Magic series, just start with the first game and keep playing them. All of the games have the same feeling, but as you progress through the series stuff will get more advanced. Not super advanced, but different from earlier games. 

Also regarding Heroes 3 (this game). If you would want more from this game, go for the original instead. The original complete edition is called Heroes of Might and Magic III COMPLETE EDITION. I am certain you can find it on GOG (Good Old Games), which is a site that sells old games. Then you will have access to all 3 campaigns for Heroes 3, without ever having to use a CD or DVD. There is also an extra series called Heroes Chronicles, which is more like games with a single campaign, for every game. Those are also fun!",1689802791,1689813455,True,0,0,0.495049476623535156,0,True,False,False

[list]
    [*] Go to GOG.
    [*] Buy Heroes of Might and Magic 3 Complete Edition for USD$9.99.
    [*] Search on Google, ""HOMM3 HD"" and download the mod.
    [*] Install HOMM3 Complete Edition from GOG 1st.
    [*] Install HOMM3 HD mod 2nd.
    [*] Tweak HOMM3 HD settings to your liking/specs before starting.
    [*] Enjoy.

Now, I shall refund this incomplete ""HD"" garbage and get back my S$4.97. 

[h1]The Review[/h1]
This is the most half-arse attempt at a remaster I've ever seen, where the developers just put the 2D sprites on Photoshop, paint over them, and call it ""mission success"" and asking us to pay S$19.90 for this. No self respecting Heroes of Might and Magic fan should buy this game. HOMM3 HD Edition is missing ""The Armageddon's Blade"" and ""The Shadow of Death"" expansions and this game came without a random map generator, the one thing that made the game infinitely more replayable.",1688187846,1688394884,False,62,1,0.829070210456848145,0,True,False,False

Back then, we squished every minute and explored the last bit of every game. Today, thanks to steam and other platforms, you have easy access and cheap prices for any game you want.

As a game, it created its own genre, mixing RPG's and Strategy. If you take apart the 2D graphics, gameplay wise, its still the best game on the franchise. Back then, improving what you already had was a great idea. Take Diablo or the Age of Empires franchise. But sadly, Heroes, did this on the entire franchise, sometimes the only touched the graphics and the gameplay remained the same. If you compare this game and the V installment, the gameplay didnt change. But that was what drove this franchise downward. This game in the other hand, its the pinnacle of the Heroes franchise.

As I was playing one of the campaigns, playing a fortress town, I noted Dragonflies (upgraded Serpent Flies) no longer have Weakness.  This is after just playing a few types of towns, and there could be other buffs/debuffs that are not applying, since I have not played and Undead or Tower town, for example.  I have played hundreds of hours of the original HOMM 3 plus expansions, so I expected a seamless reproduction of at least the core game.

If you can get it on sale, I WOULD recommend it, because it's definitely fun.  I got it for like 4 bucks and I suppose I don't regret it at that price.

However, it's quite disappointing as an ""HD Remaster"".  At the listed full price it's not worth it. The graphical upgrades are weak, and as far as I can tell there have been no other additions or improvements to the game, or any other attempts at modernization of the many outdated systems and mechanics. A few UI and menu updates would have been welcome at the very least.

In addition, there are none of the expansions included in this version either, which seems crazy for a game this old.   Just really low effort all around.",1682499380,1682502583,False,17,1,0.682653903961181641,0,True,False,False

I would be remiss if I did not sing the praises of Heroes of Might and Magic III HD, for it is a game that brings back fond memories of a time long past. Though it may not boast the grandest scope or the most intricate mechanics, it nevertheless has a charm and a simplicity that endure. Indeed, it just works well, like a finely crafted sword that may not be the sharpest or the flashiest, but never fails to do its duty.

However, let me caution you, fair travelers, that this game is not without its quirks and its flaws. As a game of an older time, it lacks some of the refinements and conveniences of more modern titles. Yet if you can overlook its rough edges, you may find that Heroes of Might and Magic III HD is a game that still has the power to enchant and delight, even after all these years. So if you seek a game that will take you back to a simpler time, when dragons roamed the land and heroes rose to greatness, look no further than this venerable classic.

Now, the HD mod that many praises, only gives you a zoom out of the whole screen to support higher resolutions and that's it. No changes to textures/sprites/bitmaps. So it's hardly the same thing.

This HD edition is based on vanilla Heroes III, that has only one campaign, Restoration of Erathia. Also, Random Map Generator was added in Armageddon's Blade, along with other additions like Conflux town, more artifacts, etc.  

I have GoG Complete version, even the big box Heroes Complete Collection, and I bought this too. It's a nice feeling to play the game that gave me so much wonderful memories. I've played the demo of this game for weeks even tho it was only one map with limited time.

The only bad thing is that the chances are very slim for a HD edition for AB and SoD.

It's the perfect game to unleash your inner strategist and conquer the world. Forget about those boring board games, this is the real deal.

You get to build your own castle and recruit mythical creatures like dragons and unicorns. Who doesn't want a unicorn army?

The soundtrack will have you humming its tunes for weeks. Catchy medieval melodies never go out of style.

You can customize your hero's skills and playstyle. Want to be a warrior with healing powers? A wizard that can ride a horse? The choice is yours.

The game has an addictive quality that will keep you playing for hours on end. Just one more turn, just one more battle, and before you know it, it's 3 am and you're still going strong.

It's a classic that has stood the test of time. Heroes of Might & Magic III was released in 1999 and still has a dedicated fanbase today. You know a game is good when it's still relevant over two decades later.

You can play against your friends and family in hot-seat mode, where you take turns on the same computer. Just make sure you don't get too competitive and end up ruining your relationships.

You get to experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Sometimes you'll win battles with ease, and other times you'll be crushed by the enemy. It's all part of the journey.

The game has a sense of humor that is hard to resist. From the quirky creature designs to the tongue-in-cheek dialogue, you'll find yourself chuckling as you play.

It's a game that rewards patience and strategic thinking. You won't win by rushing in blindly or relying solely on luck. You'll need to plan your moves carefully and adapt to changing circumstances. But when you emerge victorious, it's all worth it.",1677754370,1677754370,True,3,0,0.55155181884765625,0,True,False,False

just wanna let you know that this version of Heroes is just cash ripper. Search for HoTa on the internet, it's running on servers as this version.

Bcs this version is rly old and they just made HD of it and 'gimme money'.... Thank you Ubisoft, you just made me think you are a joke of a company. 

Remember don't buy this, buy only Complete Version on the internet, for example GoG and then download unofficial official HotA pack to it. Search for details on websites or youtube, there are tons of guides.

Just maybe don't get this version. It's still good, but it's missing the expansions and the ""HD"" is hit and miss. Get it on GoG.com and then search online for Heroes 3 HD for the Hd mod that adds widescreen support and much more. 

If you end up enjoying the game then check out HOTA, an incredible mod that adds a pirate faction and a new campaign and is SO well-crafted it feels like an official expansion. It also allows you to play online with thousands of other players, if that is your thing.

When i say it's buggy, i mean real buggy, you can't finish campaign, without using cheats, simply cause if u finish the first 3 of them, the rest does not unlock, why? Because you have to finish them all in one run, which means you can't exit the game...There's also a thing called battle tactics, like your hero upgrade which allows you to put you fighters how you want on the battlefield, it does not work all the time...I'm not sure if this is bug or not, but i get the idea whoever attacks first, gets to do turns first, well, that's not happening, AI will always attack first...

I also hate and this goes in all series, you will never be able to buy all your fighters...I hate it so much, AI doesnt seem to have this problem, I dont know how in the world they have the money for everything...I understand on higher difficulties yeah sure you get less money and materials, but im playing on normal and i still never get to buy all of them...Also AI in here literally ignores one another and just goes for you... 
I really hate what they did with next heroes, seems like new heroes came out, its worse than the last one they made...I also hate that hey changed many castles... they could've just added them!!! like in 5 heroes there are units from 3rd and you cant get them...Are they just dumb or what happened when they been creating the game???The more castles, more units, more heroes, more options to play, its so much more fun...Did they only made heroes for money??? They've already made so much money, cause there is no game like heroes...

When i say game lacks common sense, i mean for instance Orc with one axe whose ranged fighter, when you upgrade him, he holds two axes then, wouldn't it make sense if he shoots two times? Like arbalester or elf archer. It's dumb seriously. Many maps dont even hold any monsters near material camps...How am i supposed to win on expert difficulty, if i dont have any fighters, i'm supposed rely on my hero, but my hero is shit, cause he has no levels, cause again, there are no monsters to kill for exp and then AI shows up with hundreds of units against your 20-30 units, like bruh...And dont forget, they ignore one another, so litteraly all of them just goes for you...Stupid isnt it?

Anyways guys, thanks for reading :D With huge sadness im saying don't get this game, i would recommend getting 5,  but not this one, its really dumb and unpleasant to play.",1674760169,1674760169,False,1,0,0.417624503374099731,3,True,False,False

In this HD version, the developers have made a number of changes that allow for an even better gaming experience.

The biggest change is undoubtedly the improved graphics. The maps are even more detailed and beautifully rendered, and the units are more polished and lively. Additionally, the interface has been updated, making it even easier and more intuitive to control.

The game also includes several new features that were not available in the original version. One example is the new map system, which allows for easier movement around the map, or the new city management system, which allows for more effective management of resources and units.

The game offers a variety of different factions such as Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Wizards, Necromancers etc. each faction has its own unique units and abilities, giving players more strategic options.

Units are also more diverse and balanced. Each unit has its own attributes and special abilities, allowing for more complex gameplay.

The only downside of the game is the lack of new campaigns or gameplay modes, but this is understandable given that it is an HD version.

Overall, Heroes of Might & Magic III HD is a must-have for fans of turn-based strategy games and for those who want to relive the nostalgia of playing this iconic game. The game offers a lot of depth, challenging gameplay and hours of entertainment. It's a great opportunity for fans of the series or new players to experience one of the best turn-based strategy games in history.

My cousin and I would settle into his dad's computer chairs, boot up the old PC and play for hours while munching on Flintstone pushpops. I worried that my fond memories of Heroes were inflated by nostalgia, yet I fired up the game and decided to find out...

How is this 1999 game better thought-out than so many AAA titles I've played? How does Heroes III still slap so hard? How do I still suck? THE MYSTERIES. 

Combat is satisfying, the art is just delightfully ~old fantasy~ and the content included should last you a number of hours. (Currently at 30-ish and haven't finished much. But that is probably because I - as previously noted - suck).

People may complain about this version versus GOG's. My brother in Christ, you can buy it for $3 on GOG if you want DLCs, mods and HD. Yes, the current price is a bit steep for a dated game missing it's DLCs but it's more than worth it on sale ($4). While Steam should absolutely add the official DLC content, personally, I don't love the fan-made content (but major respect for making it). For instances, one of the most popular fan-made pieces fits aesthetically, but thematically it doesn't mesh for me. Sorry pirates. I prefer the classic. However having the lobby and mashing ""asl"" ""asl"" every three seconds does bring back fond memories of yor. 

Pay for both. Or don't. I did and haven't regretted it. I still play this version more and can almost taste the Flinstone pushpops.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Granted, I don't have a very deep understanding of the game, mainly because I just never looked into the game too deep. Always played it for a few hours, one scenario or whatever and then hopped off.

I think this game is one of the best ever made. This game is like Chess, never gets old, very replayable. There is no point to try to develop a brand new game, too complicated.
No need for 3D, it is good the way it is 2D with Turn Base. All you need is to upgrade the graphics every time technology make a jump. So making content for the game makes sense.
Thats why people play this game, like Diablo 2, and Fallout 2 even after 20 years. This game is one of the GOAT(greatest of all time).",1506727989,1658229439,True,0,0,0.400910645723342896,0,True,False,False

If you are thinking about buying this game (and ""BUY"" is the plain wording on every Steam store page), be aware you may only be able to play it for the next 6 weeks, before Ubisoft REMOVES it from your library.

Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  

The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.

I won't repeat cries of all the other reviews, no dlc yadda yadda. I miss the dlc but the game is playable without it, I'm not sure if its the matter of the dlc or not but you cannot change your town/faction in the custom single player game options, its tied to the color of the unit, at least for all the custom games i tried to make. 

As for the graphics, Im going to be honest, i played it and then i turned it off and went back to playing the original. The menu and everything is super well done, love that, but part of the charm of the original graphics is that:

1. it has its own aesthetic that is unique and gives you the feel good nostalgia
2. it leaves a lot to imagination, which in turn makes up for """"ugly"""" graphics

once you upscale and smooth the heros faces you can see all the weird imperfections and crooked faces that you couldnt before.

I started playing this ver after not playing the OG for a couple years now, and after playing songs of conquest for two days straight (felt nostalgic) and I didnt remember all of the differences so i couldnt be ""mad"" that its not the same as it was, but  i didnt know if it wasnt how i remembeed or if it was the hd version that was making me confused, 
some things are less intuitive because of the revamp

and the grid, god forbid the battle grid put it away, I do not want it. Makes things cluttered its squashed and ugly
I will await full extended editon as we all know that this is the best game in the franchise,

For the strenghts and the reasons I would reccomend buying this: it is incredibly annoying to set up a fake lan network to play with ur firends and get them into the game, but I still wish i could share the magic of the original with them.

This is an old game with one perpetually overwriting autosave, so don't forget to save a campaign when your switching out to another.


I remember it being one of the first games I ever played that wasn't made for children. Meaning I had no experience with the genre or the mechanics & also like six, so frustrated the hell out of me. Now its a pleasant and relaxing diversion.

And to anyone wondering Dad's geek cred: when he was younger a local games shop owner asked him to trail a new card game they just got & see what he thought. He came back and said buy as much as you can. 
The owner ended up very glad he listened, because as most old nerds can tell you Magic the Gathering was sold out in most places for months & guess who wasn't. 
The owner as you may have guessed, was a forward thinker who was willing to listen to his customers & so made money hand over fist as one of the last places in the state to have Magic cards. 
And my dad? Dad was just a teenager with good taste (for which he was rewarded with years of fun & three black lotuses he eventually sold off for rainy day money)

*[u]Updated[/u] means more QoL changes (transfer all, train all, detailed town list, heroes list, etc), hotkey customizations...

As I also stated in discussion panel,

Considering that this game is a classic, a masterpiece of TBS genre, and an element of prestige. It shouldn't be this hard to make an updated full version remaster while the source codes are found. Moreover, it will continue to be sold for years to new generations, as long as there is multiplayer support (Single is good enough, but HoMM 3 multiplayer something like chess...). Because it still has no rivals in its genre.

Even today this version has 1000-2000 online players on Steam, without any updates or exp. for years. And if you add the GoG, Ubisoft, and hd mod versions on it, we can easily think that the game has 5-10K players that play daily. Well, think the potential of an updated full version of it...

It's really surprising that the game hasn't been revived even though it's #1 on the GoG bestseller (Among 4264 games, and most of them are old but gold ones, so that'a huge success).

It's a real goldmine if they're going to take it up again. Even with a good team leader, they could keep the spirit of the game and make a very good upgrade instead of just upscaling to HD.

**Something like ""HoMM 3 Reunified"" not just ""HoMM 3 HD""... Just like Diablo 2 Resurrected not only better graphics, but deeper touchs. And again, Of course with taking the community's opinions for not to lose spirit...

And I've noticed audio and animation bugs that aren't there in the original either. 

The updated graphics look nice but what is even the point if it inexplicably somehow runs worse than the original? Just stick with the GoG version with the HD mod. It literally takes 5 minutes to set up and even the most computer illiterate person can install it. Don't waste your money on this.

Also, if I might add, it's infuriating that instead of reviewing the remaster on its own merits people just plop down a positive saying stuff like ""heroes 3=good"". Yeah, of course it's good.

HoMM3’s biggest functional limitation comes down to map variety, especially if you want to play specifically three players as a team. This can, however, be overcome by quickly modifying an existing map to suit your conditions and the community has the ability to create and upload maps for all to use. If you want, you can make your own too, of course. The scenario/map maker is rudimentary and clumsy in some ways, but is old and for an old game, so just set your expectations accordingly and you’ll be fine.

Of the HoMM series of games, this is the best in my opinion, and the community as a whole seems to agree despite there being seven iterations (that I’m aware of). It’s a unique game and a lot of fun. There may be some frustration points with the interface, but you can always reload and redo with relative ease.

If you’ve got a friend to play this with, either as a team, or as opponents, it is a very fun game. If you’re playing solo, the fun is still good so long as you can adapt to the fact that the game tries to balance out the poor AI of the time when it was first developed by giving the AI some better conditions to ensure you don’t walk all over them. If you’re looking to relive the classic game, this is it as you remember, but without the instability issues that started up as the game became more and more obsoleted while operating systems got replaced over the years.",1642701374,1642701374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I own the original jewel case Complete edition and I've logged well over 250 hours with that version.  I also own the game on iOS and have logged well over 50 hours on the iPad.

Heroes of Might and Magic III is a strategy classic that has been endlessly emulated, not only by its four successors (on various platforms), but also by other franchises like Age of Wonders, Disciples and more.  The game blends an insane number of magical items, spells, units, factions and hokey music/artwork to create a quintessential ode to TBS fantasy fare.  The game has been graphically remastered, albeit quite minimally and still allows players to play using singleplayer campaign, singleplayer scenario, multiplayer hot seat and default multiplayer.  While the game is missing several expansions and the Conflux faction, the game is still great fun and a worthy classic to pick up for one's Steam collection.

9/10.

The game holds the test of time very well and has a dedicated following. While I play 5, 6, and 7 more these days (blasphemy, I know), I do like to go back to HoMM3 HD from time to time when I am feeling nostalgic and want to recapture the feeling of my childhood. I initially came across this game as a child and fell it love with it. As an adult, I love it even more.

Whilst I do love this game, I do have one massive gripe. My major complaint is the lack of expansions and random map generator. These need to be added eventually. I really wish they'd have added Conflux to the HD remaster. I know there are downloads online which address this specific problem, but it just feels like a oversight when this HD remake was made relatively recently. Regardless of this complaint, however, you will still have an immensely satisfying experience. I also enjoy the updates they've given to the visuals of the game (which enhance what is already there without harming its integrity).

----------------------------------------------------------

VERDICT:

If you want to experience the game to its fullest, do what other people have said and get it from GOG with the patches and upgrades. It costs less and you will have all the expansions and content like the random map generator (which is where the fun really begins with HoMM games!!). However, I don't mind also having this remaster on steam and you are still getting hours of fun content from getting this version.

If you played this when you were younger like I did, then definitely get it for the nostalgia factor. It does go on sale from time to time as well, so if you can hold out for a sale, do it. It fills a warm fuzzy place in my heart and forever will.

If you are new to the series, HoMM3 is a good version of the series to get and really captures the original feel and essence of the games that 3DO gave it. However, I feel like nostalgia can paint a rose lens visually and the graphics can be quite jarring for a newcomer. In that respect, if you want a more visually appealing version, I'd recommend starting with HoMM5 (with the 5.5 patch you can find online) which is praised by the community and is overall good, or HoMM7 which I feel captures a lot of feeling of HoMM3 in a more modern aesthetic and has a UI which educates you about the games mechanics better (Number 7 gets a lot of criticism but I have been really enjoying it and have few complaints with it. It actually isn't as bad as people make it out to be. I made a review addressing that. It is also really good value on sale).

Either way you are bound to fall in love with Heroes of Might and Magic, and HoMM3 is no exception. The series always evokes a feeling of whimsy and imagination within me. There is a reason why HoMM3 game has persisted with such a strong niche following after all these years.

----------------------------------------------------------

Tl;dr - Get the game.

Also, side note: I love whenever I enter a battle and Combat Music 2 starts playing. The memories it gives me!!",1640378505,1640379457,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm not really upset about the lack of Conflux, this faction was hastily put together and hilariously op in most situations. But no AB and SoD means none of the best maps and no RMG. For more sp-oriented people there's also no additional campaigns, which were vastly superior to the ones from RoE (especially the AB campaigns are the peak of the series).

Seriously, just buy the Complete edition, slap the HD mod on it (apart from increased resolutions it actually improves the game by adding some great functionality, like automatic force transfer between armies for example) and you'll have yourself a vastly superior game for a lower cost.

But to be able to play a turn based game with friends as allies, while having some beer is one of the best things about gaming (didnt drink beer when it first came out). This is what gaming have evolved to by my standards! And this game have some mighty nostalgia to it as well.

Now to the game: Great for its era, but could be improved a lot while still having the core game being what it is and does best. Things like not having options before actually starting a map, not being able to view your friends actions in combat, or just follow their turn being played out live (just their map movements), is really the things I hate, and could have been added at a later stage.

[i]HoMM3[/i] was one of my favorite games as a kid, and it remains one of the few franchises that I still own everything physically.

When an HD version was announced for Steam, I was both curious and suspicious (suscurious if you will), and surely, they messed up at least one important aspect:

This version does not have the expansions, namely [i]Armageddon's Blade[/i] and [i]The Shadow of Death[/i] that introduced new faction, creatures, artifacts, and of course several new campaigns and level editor features (including the popular random map generator). The reason has been stated as the publisher ""losing the data files"". Maybe that's true; either way, it's disappointing to say the least.

In almost* all respects, the GoG version of [url=https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition]HoMM3 Complete[/url] is superior to this version, although you need to add the HD mod separately.

[h1]Gameplay re-cap for the new gens[/h1]

Turn-based strategy franchise, in [i]HoMM[/i] you run a kingdom, and at its core are towns and heroes. Towns are upgraded by constructing new buildings and upgrading the old ones, ultimately to hire better troops. Troops are given to heroes that level up and get better and more powerful when fighting and old-school-DnD-style by converting treasures into sweet XP.

Combat is also turn-based, borrowing its implementation from [i]King's Bounty[/i] franchise; troops act as stacks, attacking and counter-attacking in turn, moving in the order of the speediest creature first. The hero helps by adding their stats and skills into the mix and by casting a bunch of helpful spells. Good use of spells can totally turn the tide of battle.

Scenarios are typically won by beating the other side(s) completely, though winning conditions may vary with scenario, particularly in the campaigns.

HoMM3 was the culmination of the franchise development, up until 5th game: it had better, more realistic graphics (instead of cartoony like the first two), adding upgrades to all dwelling creatures and upping the number of factions and campaigns. HoMM4 tried its own thing with hero-less armies and individualized heroes that can also fight and die regardless of their army, and HoMM5 upped the stakes again similarly to HoMM3. The 5th remains the best game in the franchise in my opinion, even if I nostalgize the heck out of the 3rd. (Some day I will try out [i]M&M: Heroes VI[/i] and [i]VII[/i] and see what they did)

[h1][b]Almost*:[/b] What's better?[/h1]

HD Edition does have couple of tricks versus the otherwise superior GoG version.

[b]Steam achievements:[/b] There's an achievement for beating all campaigns. The rest of it is just meaningless grind: beating any scenarios at each difficulty level ten times. As I'd rather play the GoG version for that, I just made a dummy map using the still fine level editor and grinded those through in mere minutes.

[b]Steam and multiplayer:[/b]: In principle you can use Steam to organize MP games. Alas, the MP is dead, aside from planned games.

[b]It's HD:[/b] Duh. Also, you can see the difference to the original by pressing F2. I swear it used to look better in SD than it does now; golden memories, amirite?

Hotseat MP works just as before but there's little reason to play on Steam when GoG version is superior. Hotseat is some of the most fun I've had gaming with friends and siblings, but sadly it often takes aeons to complete.

[h1]Technical stuff[/h1]

Game works fine both in windowed and fullscreen modes. Many of the game features can be adjusted, from sound and music volume to combat speed to player and AI movement speed. You can even automatize combat, though I dislike the results as the AI tends to be just wasteful with both troops and mana (although you can forbid it to use magic).

Having double monitors, I noticed that the game freezes when mouse is off on the other monitor (unfreezing when you return), and it's not locked in to the screen. Minor thing for me (I liked that I could still scroll Discord on the other monitor though) but it's something to acknowledge, and it minimizes the game if you click the focus away.

[h1]Conclusions[/h1]

I wholly recommend [i]Heroes of Might and Magic 3[/i]. However, I'd recommend purchasing the GoG complete version instead and upping that with the fan-made HD mod.

Still, I recommend this version for anyone who wants to boast having played through the campaigns and getting the Steam achievements to show for it. For me, this took a whopping 82 hours (with few hours of idle afking included). I wish that the expansions some day make it to Steam but I do not have my hopes up.

I'm still rly upset they didnt carry over the Sylvan faction and dumped phoenixes into Conflux which we dont even get to play in this version of the game.
The reason Heroes 2 still trumps over 3 is the artifact system which didn't really need the change, it was simple and the scaling was really nice. The campaign is another major factor - HOMM3 seemingly not focusing on it as much which is evident by any campaign except Erathia. Also HOMM2 prettier imo.

You run around the map collecting things, fighting monsters and beating other heroes and taking their castles. I'm putting things in simple terms but the game has a lot more to it, is not too complex and is very addictive, probably one of the best games ever made.

Read some of the other reviews here and you will see this: 
Best game ever OR awful because it doesn’t include the DLC’s.

I think the latter has its points but its not awful or bad in any shape or form other than missing the two DLC’s, one of which is completely skippable.

This is what you get if you buy this: 
A very, VERY well done remaster of the Heroes of Might & Magic III game along with some conversion tools (check the community page) to add maps etc. This is more than enough for most people who simply want to play and not bother with mods etc. Let's put it this way, you get a ton of gameplay with the main game, I’m talking up to 100 hours (check the website howlongtobeat). The replayability is pretty much endless and it’s a nice price in terms of the enjoyment you will get from it. It’s a classic and it looks great, better IMO than the HD mod.

This is what you will not get: The two DLC's that were released after the game came out in the 1990’s. Armageddon's Blade (has new content and is quite good) and The Shadow of Death (skippable has no new content out of the base game). There are also various fanmade maps for the original game that may not work with this HD version.
 
All I can say is this is a very good remaster of a classic game, I highly recommend buying it and trying it out even if you own the complete version. Yes it's that good, buy both and support the HD remaster, they did a heck of a job (and yes minus the DLC).

Kind of a fantasy version of Civilization. Upgrade your city. Train, hire, and equip heroes. Give those heroes armies to wield and send them out to conquer. The map is large. The loot varied and abundant. The exploration is rewarding. 

Is their a story? Sure, but nothing not found in a Saturday morning cartoon. The graphics are primitive but passable. There are various campaigns. Or just do an open scenario. This provides some replayability. Combat is turn based on a grid map. But what can be expected from a game made in the early days of computer gaming?

I reeeeaaaally loved that game. My PC wasn't running it that well, loading were long and graphics low, but I was enjoying every second of it. And after getting to know the franchise, all these years I have been hearing about HoMM III, how it is the best, how it is superior, how it is perfect and all. Finally in 2015 I had a chance to get my hands, well, the cursor of my mouse to be precise xD, on the official version of HoMM III (till that time I haven't played it ever as I didn't want to play its pirate version, I have my code LOL). So, in 2021 I finally had time and courage to install this game. I played the campaign and multiplayer to give my objective opinion. In the end, I wanted to know what the hype around this game was about. And I am kind of disappointed. Not because ""ugh, pixels! I hate pixels!1!!1!!"". Well first, I should say that I grew up in 90's with pixel graphics of Civilization and Warcraft 2, so pixels aren't an issue here, but the story. It simply is medicore, yeah, even for this old game. Some things I want to clear:
- The game is complex, at least for new players. I admit, even I, a hardcore fan of HoMM franchise, had hard time in the beginning to differentiate objects and icons;
- About differentiating, there is slight or no gap among fractions, it is hard to recognize which town belong to which fraction. I don't mean it is that hard, but you know, in HoMM V you can get the idea of Inferno town just by looking at it, even if you are a total newbie and has no idea what the game is about, you will still get the idea it belongs to demons, got it? Also, heroes seem to have more human-ish look. It, honestly, bugged me.
- About creature designs. I wouldn't go that far to totally crush this game with my critical review as this game is old and it did a great job to portray creatures in a more enjoyable, aesthetic and charismatic way, HOWEVER, they could have done Devils better. Devils in black night dress with a scythe in their hands?! LMAO;
- Story. As I said it is just medicore. Don't start ""shut up, you hater"". Throw your nostalgia sh*t and look closely what you are playing. Again, I will give an example from HoMM V, not because I have nostalgia sh*t for that game, but it really deserves more attention and love than it gets. The story of HoMM V trilogy, in my honest opinion, is one of the best not only among HoMM franchise, but among in games I have played in general! I am serious. They could just create Netflix TV series based on it and I would watch it;
- Okay, after all this criticism you are probably thing why I gave thumbs up to this game, huh? The thing is that this game's gameplay, i.e playing mechanics is the same, the franchise never changes, and it is a good thing. Maybe the reason, that this game is still popular among TBS fans is because its gameplay mechanics? I don't deny, it is possible. I still am glad I bought and played this game. I enjoyed every second of it. It made me happy, too. But again, the story made me sad that it sucked, yeah, but the game is still HoMM, and I will always be happy to play any HoMM game.",1624979795,1624979795,True,0,0,0.473555564880371094,0,True,False,False

i've played this countless hours back in the day, it was one of my first games on PC (yeah I was a console boy for a long time due to being poor).
There was no internet back then (well there was but it wasn't anything like it is now, it was crazy expensive (like ¼ of monthly income) and there was much less content) so I didn't have any guides or help playing this. I remember I was stuck at one mission for weeks and then I uninstalled it. But I probably played ~200h.

There are huge maps to explore and assemble your armies. Each mission provides different map, from smaller ones and more simple ones with easier goals to huge ones where brutal enemies attack you and you start over and think how can you change your tactics and resource management.

Speaking about resource management it's a very important part of the game. Resources are very limited and you need to them to upgrade your buildings which let you recruit your army. The higher level the building the better units it provides for you.

The are factions and each faction has its own units. Some factions could have great low-tier units so they're strong in the beginning of the game and could give you a nice start. Others might have stronger high-tier units which obliterate everything. You need to carefully manage your army since you can take limited amount of units to your battles and exploration of the map. You can be met by the enemy any time so you need to be prepared. You need to know the enemy and which units he most likely will have and take that into account when forming your armies. Units have their strengths and weaknesses so you need to exploit them.

Combat is turn based where you move on the grid. Each unit can move a certain number of distance each turn or attack. There are slow units, fast units, flying units and stationary units, so again, I can't stress this enough – plan everything, always be prepared for the worst and have a backup plan.
You also have heroes and they serve as commanders. They can equip items and spells which give buffs for your units or spells for your hero.
In short the gameplay is all about capturing cities as quickly as possible and not letting enemy any time to become stronger than you and breathe on your neck all the time because each time your army is defeated it becomes more likely you wont have enough time to recover. It's a very challenging yet rewarding game.

Graphically it's not a gem by today's standards obviously. But who can judge such an old game? In my opinion it looks damn cool considering its age. And the most surprising thing it has ultrawide support. Probably by accident.

This is definitely one of the most potato friendly games so doesn't matter what you have it will run fine.

Sounds is nothing special. Music is pretty nice but all other sounds are meh. Again it's an old game but I think sounds could've been better even at that time. But that's only a very minor downside which doesn't affect anything.

A wonderful strategy game, a true classic every strategy fan should play.

Pros
-It's still Heroes 3! One of the best strategy games you can play on your computer.
-Dozens of scenarios and 8 fascinating factions with wonderful artwork, reminiscent of a fairy tale book.
-Updated artwork allows (if you have played the OG, remember: It's my opinion. Don't flame me) some things to look more beautiful here than in the original version. E.g: the cities.

Cons
-The Updated artwork makes some weird design choices and makes some models (first example that comes to mind are the Castle's swordsmen) look weirder and in a way worse than in the original.
-It's only the base game. For some reason you don't get any of the two expansions and you pay 13 euros, while you can get the complete original version for less (If you find it. I don't think there are many shops that include it).
-One faction is not included.

Considering I have to put a recommend/not recommend I will put the latter, but it's up to you, depending on whether what you read makes you interested.

If I were to judge Heroes of Might & Magic 3 on its own I would put it at a 9/10. The HD edition  would be somewhere around 6/10 due to only making a visual improvement and not much more.",1605959154,1622114434,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]HoMM3 is a great game. I don't think anyone really checks the reviews to make a decision whether to buy it or not. 
The kicker here is, [b]HoMM3 HD on Steam doesn't have the expansions[/b]. Sure, it fixes some bugs and enhances the textures but it creates more bugs than it had previously. 
[*]This version also removes the random map option.

It's ridicules how bad is this version of the game. Yeah, you have HD models, but that's the ""good"" part of the game. ""Bad"" part? Well, all old bugs, introduced new bugs and unfinished game:
- existing bug: it's just a vanilla remaster (kind of obvious and I known it), but all fixed bugs and balance provided in the DLCs haven't been added here - so dissapointed
- new bug: moat is useless (no damage to the units), 
- new bug: I've never seen AI building more than 2nd magic guild in the city, 
- new bug: AI is much more stupid than in the original and with DLC versions,
- unfinished game: Ubisoft removed random maps (lol, one of the best part of the game wtf),
- unfinished game: game crashed 3 times in 4 hours of the game (I've never had a crash in original Heroes 3)
- unfinished game: I tried to use Polish (nostalgic way of playing H3), but I saw encoded wrongly Polish characters - something which I saw years ago (2006 vibe). No one even try to run game with different language to see if there is any problem? The first popup in the game will display incorrect encoding of the characters

This is just an experience after 4 hours of the game. It's much worse than the original version. Even after 5 years of the release, you can still find really obvious bugs introduced in this HD version.

This is a great game. great and immersive gameplay.

But to anyone wanting to buy this game, beware!

It is not the collectors edition, which means: 
- It is missing a lot of content like maps, castles, scenarios, creatures, you name it.
- FPS is capped at 30.
- No random maps.

I bought this game for the simple nostalgia factor only to be disappointed by the lack of content it has after a while of playing. Don't make the same mistake that I did by buying the game on Steam.
This is only a HD rendition of the base game - there are no DLCs included, yet the game costs €15,00.
You can stretch a good 30+ hours of gameplay from this, but you won't be getting the full experience.

What you can do instead, is buy the game on either GOG or UBISOFT store for LESS MONEY, where the DLCs are included. Then you go ahead and install a fan-made HD mod, which is FREE, although doesn't quite reach the HD quality that the Steam rendition has, but you can tweak the resolution, different sharpness modes and other things.

Heroes III has a shiny polish, but you get no access to the expansion (even though it is shown in the list). This isn't the Ultimate Heroes III experience.

It's also a turn based/adventure game series that peaked with its third instalment. I have lost countless hours playing the campaign, multiplayer and creator mode, on my disc copy back in the day. 
The design and models are still looking good, even been slightly improved with the HD re-release. The campaign can get a bit repetitive. So, I recommend playing custom games against friends or/with bots. The game maybe does not look it, but it can get extremely entertaining due to all informal pacts and backstabbing possible during the matches. 
Being turn-based, multiplayer is even possible on one computer, which also is the ideal way to play, if you ask me.
If you haven’t played it, buy it. There’s no coherent story worth knowing, and as mentioned this is the best one. 
Just be warned, the cut scenes have aged so fucking bad, I mean holy shit. They have aged so bad, it’s comical.

Friendly tips:
Speed up rounds in the settings. This will help you avoid dying a natural death before finishing your first match.

i still love this game.

World: imagine Settelers of Catan, but the land you own is not based on Hexagons and its more indept sort of. land/areas have either wood,gold or Metal and all of the areas have monsters/consequences, and evryone else wants whats yours.  (i realize now that ""Risk"" would have been a better way to explane it.)

Characters/Heroes: so this is Basically just ""Guess who?"" some people have lizzard faces and dogs that walk like humens as soldiers and others have a dog face and use demons with tiny wings as soldiers.

This game lacks the expansions and content that initially made Heroes 3 what it is today. Any version of Heroes 3 without the complete experience is not a complete game and veteran fans of the Might and Magic franchise deserve more than this.

Some of us still bought the game knowing what it lacked to support the company in hopes that it would continue to provide content and general maintenance. When news of a Steam release for Heroes of Might and Magic 3 reached our ears, a lot of us had expected that content would be added after time.

To our disappointment, further development to the 1/3rd of a game we were given stopped shortly after it's release. A majority who experienced this disappointment turned to GoG and purchased the Complete edition that they offered. Though GoG lacks an HD integration with their copy, fans eager to have the more complete game in their possession would make that small sacrifice for the sake of functionality and completeness.

Most veteran fans and tech-savvy Heroes 3 owners will grab that copy and install the HoMM3 HD mod by Alexander Barinov to, more or less, recreate the Heroes 3- HD Edition experience with GoG's Complete edition. This, of course, nearly takes away from the point of attaining or playing Ubisoft's Steam release.

For new fans looking to purchase or have already purchased this game, once they learn about the large amount of missing content in this Steam release, they often become discouraged to continue playing.

The only thing that can save this HD Steam release is adding the expansions in one way or another. The game is in danger of becoming Steam abandonware. Successful games keep up with maintenance and add content. I would revise this review completely if they could tackle that main issue.

So if you're new or a veteran fan of Heroes 3, I'd highly recommend you to wait for the Complete HD game or go check out GoG's release with the HD Mod.",1606602166,1606602166,False,179,1,0.94219052791595459,5,True,False,False

for me it was pain in the ass to repeat campaign I've done before - it was not fun - especially when we add later struggles in last camapaigns it is very easy to feel the blank cased by missing hd tools.

AI is still broken, so completing last mission of campaign was easier than some final maps of second two campaign even if diffrence betwen difficulty level was like 100 percent (I believe day and night map is 100-120%, and final map of main campaign is like 200%) so this fact is more like disadvantage when we talk about remaster.

The HD upgrades are noticeable if you're doing a side by side comparison, but not going to blow anyone away. It seems like nothing has been rebuilt, just cleaned up. I think other than a moment here or there where you realize a menu icon isn't what you always thought it was or an animation that impresses with its crispness, you'll probably forget about it--which isn't necessarily a knock. I'm glad it looks and feels like I remember and more importantly, this is the peak of this series and the type of game that sucks you in and keeps you focused on the game, so it makes sense you wouldn't be thinking a ton about how good it looks or not. It was never about the graphics or frame rates; it was about the gameplay.

If you're completely new to this game, I would still recommend it. It's not just nostalgia that makes this game good--it holds up because it has a solid foundation and does what it sets out to do extremely well, mixing map exploration with town building and turn based strategy. It's a unique blend of these elements that few other games or series have ever pulled off. That said, if you're not usually a fan of a slower pace of game, I would watch some gameplay videos before buying.

There's not much more I could say that isn't also true of the original, so reviews from back when it first came out will still be relevant, but I want to emphasize that there's a ton of replay value in this game in the random scenarios and endless possibilities for custom maps. There's still sites that share hundreds of user maps for the original version--I haven't checked if any of those would work with this version of the game (or if there are updates of those), or if there is a similar community here for this release, but if it doesn't already exist, I have to think it will, and you'll have an endless supply of new maps and scenarios to play in no time. And if you don't have the best internet and live with friends or family who also game, this one is great for playing together, because you can go head to head or play as allies, taking turns in ""hot seat"" mode. 

I'm happy to have a version of this game optimized for current computers and even if that was literally the only change to the game, I'd be happy for it... in fact, I think I still have an installation of this game from GOG that is just that.

The negative: I did have some issues running the game in full screen on Windows 10. I think it might be an issue with my machine, so I'm going to keep playing with it. Running windowed seemed to solve the issue. It still crashed on me at one point.

 - Looks good on HD

Cons
 - No ""Shadow of death"" and ""Armageddon blade"" expansion, at least make it possible as DLC???
 - A lot of neutral monsters/camps are not in this version, like Fearie dragon & Crystal dragon etc. 
 - No map generator, you are done with the game after the campaigns. No endless fun like the old version.

This just isnt a game you play for the graphics. It looks dated even in HD. You play HoMM3 for the gameplay. Even in 2020 this is still an amazing turn based strategy game. It has story, fantasy, castles, knights and dragons all working together (or against eachother). The UI works well and the game runs stable, even on modern systems.

I love this game. I started playing it way back as a kid, when we rented it from the local library 20 odd years ago. I still play it now, although I usually play my GOG version. I love it so much, I started playing it again on steam just to get the achievements. But being honest, I just cannot recommend you buying it on steam. As great as the game is, its just not complete on steam.

EDIT: Slight update and a few spelling errors.

Since the initial review, I have played through most of the campaign and logged quite a few more hours. HoMM3 is every bit as much fun as I remember. It runs quite well on steam and occasionally, its actually noticeable that its the HD.

However, this extra playtime does not sway my initial opinion. I still recommend getting this game on GOG. The minute improvement on graphics is just not enough. And the HD port brings a few, albeit minor, issues with it in the campaign. 

Certain campaign triggers do not work, so you cannot always explore the entire map, or gather all artifacts on the map. These are minor issues and you can finish the map just fine for the campaign, but for someone who knew how it was supposed to work, it was a slight letdown.

Its still a great game though, and at the time of writing, I have already logged over 20 hours. If I had to choose between a movie ticket or this game on Steam, I'd pick the game. Regardless of the movie. It's just a shame the game is not complete on steam.",1597619512,1598225553,False,156,2,0.898681223392486572,0,True,False,False

The orchestral score is memorable and unlike anything you will hear in other games.

The castles are well-balanced and if you play on a huge map it might take good 24 hours to finish a scenario.

There's this awesome feeling you get when you successfully defend a castle against a superior force because you skip a turn when you have to, fortify your unit when you have to, attack a stronger enemy unit with your weak unit and make him waste his retaliation, and focus on the flying unit first, etc.

All of these things are available from GOG in their HOMM3: Complete package at a lower price, so I cannot recommend it on that basis.

For those simply looking to find the prettiest version of this cult classic, there is a mod available called HOMM3: Horn of the Abyss that is compatible with GOG's Complete edition which includes higher quality HD textures, dozens of UI improvements, online support, 30+ random map generator templates, long-requested ease of use updates, as well as new creatures, buildings, artifacts and mechanics. Did I mention the brand new playable faction of nomadic sea-faring pirates? Called Cove, the new faction is fully compatible with classic and random maps alike, and has its own three-part campaign.
On top of all that, when compared to this $30 HD Edition, HotA seems very fairly priced at the grand sum of F**KING FREE.

The higher resolution is nice on some of the artwork but it also points out several of the sloppy animations like on the Castle Champions where they bounce around a lot. It unfortunately appears to just be the original game without the expansion packs. If you are as big a fan of the game as I am though it's 100% worth the $10 to have the nicer artwork.

Hope that eventually the entire Heroes Chronicles Expansion Pack set comes out in HD. I'm surprised this wasn't done as soon as the upgraded artwork came out as all of the games use the same assets and mechanics to the best of my knowledge.

Recommendations for future improvements: Reanimate the intro scene and the mission opening loop videos using a more complex rendering software than was available when the game was first made. Add more frames to the creature animations to make their actions look a little smoother. Fix some of the weird physics in the game animations, such as the Ballista recoils forwards instead of backwards when shooting.",1593757820,1593757820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

---ACTUAL REVIEW---

This is, even over 20 years later, the best in the series. This particular version is the original game with HD graphics. The main appeal is two fold: easy, no hoops to jump through multiplayer and you can play it on your phone through Steamlink.

I own this version, the CD version and the GoG version and I recommend all three for different reasons... the GoG version is complete but requires additional steps to play multiplayer. If you're cheap or simply cannot afford more than one version then get the GoG version IMO.",1588189710,1591820390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't care to, and have never played H3 multiplayer, keep that in mind. I have never played the original vanilla game, instead I used a mod to make the game playable on modern computers, I'll get to that in a moment.

The biggest pros are the new HD graphics, standard support for 1080p, and more than 64k colors.
The biggest cons for the new HD version is that you could install a mod for the original game called 'HoMM3 HD' ( https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/ ) which supported larger resolutions than the standard 800x600, 32-bit colors, and it added A LOT to the game, A LOT! You can imagine a mod being worked on for at least 5 years, has some great features. After you use the mod, it's hard to go back to the vanilla game and all of the mouse clicking involved with it.

I'm not here to say this HD version sucks, it's a classic game. You can play random maps by loading pre-built RoE random maps generated with the original game (or downloaded online). There's a tablet version, but you could already play the original game on a tablet before. 

To me the only thing this game adds to the old game is updated graphics, and for me that's not that big of a deal, I would rather have the features from the HD mod instead of the graphics, so I'll stick to the old game until there's a mod for H3 HD.

I'm also hating that I'm reviewing a game called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 HD"", but it should be called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 - Restoration of Erathia HD"" --- there's a big difference and I'm still sore about it.

(2017-07-20):
It's come to my attention the reason Ubi decided not include the expansions of the game because the were unable to acquire the original source code ([url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160719030042/https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/a-special-announcement]source[/url]). I linked to the archive.org version so ubi can't change anything like they already have. You'll notice currently the image in the Steam store says 'The Restoration of Erathia' underneath HD Edition. This was NOT the case when I originally purchased the game:
 [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20150206090057/http://store.steampowered.com/app/297000/]proof[/url]

Ubi had this image, which includes the RoE tagline at the bottom, back in 2014 before the game was released on Steam, but decided to omit that and made no mention that it didn't include the expansions, nor did they provide a link to their page on their website that said it didn't include it. I'm not sure if they even had this game on their own store back in 2015 (it's not there as of today). I believe that I should be allowed to receive a full refund for purchasing a game that isn't as advertised. Yes, I am still sore about it.

BTW, the 'HoMM3 HD' that I posted above will not work with this game. Take a look at what that mod does for the UI: [url=https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/eng/description/extended-ui]here[/url]

Also, sales figures and average playtime stats are in: https://steamspy.com/app/297000

Ubi'is'soft has been very very very bad.

I'm refering to the fact that the lost source code was found and sent to Ubisoft
https://twitter.com/DiskBlitz/status/920801845349466113

Ubisoft had a FAQ for this game of why they didn't do the complete version which states they don't have the source code. There hasn't been an update to the FAQ or any mention of the HOMM IP since this HD version was released 5 years ago. They need to address the elephant in the room or let another publisher do so. I can't trust a company that ignores answers to the #1 complaint to their game or that misleads advertising a game to increase sales, which was to ignore that #1 complaint -- they knew not having the source code would be an issue. They decided to hide that when releasing the game. They now have the source code. There are no excuses. Make the expansions.

If you want to get the full homm3 experience you need to buy the gog version and download the hd patch, because homm3 hd edition does not include the 2 expansions and the random map feature , so because of this i also got the gog version that includes all the additional content.

So basically get it on a sale like me or just buy the gog version instead. I got them both , the gog version for the full homm3 single player experience and the modding capability, and also the steam version for the multiplayer feature and the better graphics(that are just a little bit better then the homm3 gog version with the hd patch installed).",1575109617,1588610748,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The fullscreen mode can't keep the mouse inside the game container: when you try to scroll map left or right by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen, it ends up on other monitors (I have 3) - which is very annoying.

During a battle you can cast attacking spells (like magic arrow) on empty cells, which instantly crashes the game. 


And the fact that I'm writing this review in 2020, 5 years after the release date, shows Dotemu and Ubisoft haven't just slacked on quality assurance - apparently they also just don't care enough to fix it.

(Lackluster version of a legendary game)

============

Review:

Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a legendary game - but unfortunately the HD edition does not do it justice.

Well, I knew beforehand that the HD version was bad - that's why I have avoided buying it for years, but now that it was in -75% sale, I decided to get it anyway.

So yeah, I knew it was bad - but I was still sort of surprised how half-assedly made it is.

And I'm not even talking about the missing content - but rather the HD graphics / resolution itself, which was supposed to be the selling point of this version.

Yes, the game looks better than the original. The sprites are much sharper and the general look is superior to the original.

BUT.. there is always a BUT. Only the adventure map is actually ""completely"" finished - as in it fills the whole screen at HD resolutions. But the town screens and combat screen have pretty large borders! 

It's quite ""meh"" to play full screen and having a WINDOW at the middle of the screen for these things. Like.. they did the adventure map right - why the hell did they mess up the town and combat screens?

Add a lot of missing content and tons of quality of life updates that are missing from the HD edition to the mix, and you'll understand why I don't recommend this.

============

Seriously, a lot of people have said it before - just getting the original complete edition and modding it (for free) is a better choice than this half-assed ""HD"" edition.

That way you get all the content of the game and balance fixes, quality of life improvements - and with the HD mod it looks nearly the same anyway!

And you can even mod the complete edition with stuff like Horn of the Abyss or ERA 2 if you want even more extra stuff to play around.

The half-assedly made ""HD"" graphics just are not worth all the missing things.

Only buy this if you get it really cheap and don't want to bother modding it.

============

Summary:

The Good 👍
+ Looks better than the original

The Bad 👎
- Town/Combat Screens half-assedly made
- Lacks the two expansions
- Lacks a lot of balance updates / quality of life improvements

If you're new to the series, this isn't a bad thing to get, however (and this is proven by the many fans who are disappointed) fans of the game should stick with the original disk. 
I hope the other parts of this game come out, and we're not charged ridiculous amounts of money for them (but what are the chances of that) all I can say is that if my disk drive was working, I'd be playing this game on the original disk.

Of course not, this game is great and I welcome it to the steam library

The Restoration of Erathia is back so the modern gaming community can have an experience like no other, the gameplay is still solid, but the animations are somewhat dated, other than that the game still holds strong and is a must-play

I do however do not recommend getting the GOG version over this as you'll need mods to get it feeling up to date and yes it has the ""DLC'S"" but if you want something easy without having to install mods and just want to download and play without fiddling with files (even tho its an easy process) Just get the steam version, once you're done with the steam version go and check out the GOG version and see what you missed.",1583006309,1583006424,True,9,3,0.510875403881072998,0,True,False,False

I think that a remastered HD Edition is a good thing and out of conveniance I very much so like the idea, but I do not think that this conveniance is worth 14.99 €, especially so given that this product DOES NOT include the expansions. Not having the expansion pack will naturally entail that one will have exhausted most of the maps in no time, as for maps where one can play on impossible difficulty, there are but a few of those. 

Had this product included the old, complete edition I believe the reviews had been much more positive, for this is truly the pebble in the shoe. It is such a waste, because unlike Warcraft 3 Reforged, this product adds conveniance into the lives of Heroes 3 nerdiness. I can easily play with my friends and share in that sublimity of experiencing this Gem, with that soothing Rampart Town music keeping all stress at bay and the dancing dragons in the background. Me and my friends can still do this, unfortunately, where the Complete Edition was a source of unlimited joy, this product is very much so limited.

(1) The HOMM3 Complete (Let's just call this the GOG version, for simplicity), (2) the HOMM3 Complete with free HD mod (The GOG version with HD Mod), and (3) this version, UBI HOMM3 HD Edition. I have played hundreds of hours of Heroes 3 under the GOG version with HD mod, for this UBI HOMM3 HD Edition, some 26 hours. Firstly, the other comments are 90 percent right, the GOG with HD mod is the way to go. The 10 percent where UBI HOMM3 HD Edition is right is that, the game looks 100 times better. I play it on a 4K 32 inch monitor, and I love the graphics. Where I have a problem with this game is that it does away with all of the game innovations that have been introduced in the GOG version (the expansions of AB and SoD) and the free HD mod. Innovations in the expansions in Complete are applied to all maps in the original HOMM3 game. Also, there are innovations in the free HD mod to H3 Complete which infinitely improve the game. Now, fortunately, UBI HOMM3 HD Edition has already been modded by the community to make it better, with shortcuts for unit quick swapping and splitting, Load and Save, a fix for the cursor movement speed, and the addition of all the SoD and AB maps, all really making the game playable. However, one big problem that I encountered with UBI HOMM3 HD Edition is some very bad AI in some games, which I have not encountered in the GOG version. I have found the AI to make bad decisions on the world map, such as run from me grossly for 98 percent of the game when they have twice my army size. Pretty much, making the game somewhat unplayable. In the GOG version, the AI does not seem to have those bugs (Not that I have encountered). Also, one other note, the moats UBI HOMM3 HD Edition do no damage. In Complete, they do, and it makes more sense, that castle-take-over be tougher with walkers. This falls into the category of missing innovations in the complete version, but, I thought worth mentioning. Verdit: (1) Nice work on the graphics, (2) Questionable AI, and UBI HOMM3 HD needs the mod already created by the community to make it playable (the ones for swapping and for all SoD and AB maps).
***Edit after 96 hours played:*****
I have given the game another chance. I probably have more hours here than anybody else ever reviewing it. 
One important aspect I forgot to mention in the original is also, the game has no random map generator, an innovation that is available in the GOG version.
And now, today, Horn of the Abyss (AKA HOTA), an excellent unofficial expansion has been released, and has now become the new standard for online multiplayer play with built-in match-making service and ranking system, a new castle, and many, many improvements (too many to mention). The game now is better than it has ever been with this.
To come back to the review on UBI H3 HD Edition, I play it now sometimes because the graphics are just so much better (the graphics on the GOG version just sometimes is uncomfortable on the eyes after a few hours to too much of a degree). It's very satisfying to see some of the creature battle models re-made in infinitely superior definition visuals and watching them do battle (some of my personal re-touch favorites are the cyclops and bone dragons, but there's many to watch re-made with a nice touch), and also to see the greatly improved world map, castles, hero portraits, creature portraits, and also the skill portraits. So, I give this game a re-review.
Verdict Revisited, and I am not finished re-evaluating the AI aspect (I assume the AI is simply the AI in the original HOMM3 RoE game): I bounce back between the UBI H3 HD version and the GOG H3 Complete version with HOTA expansion. When I want a particular refined gameplay, it's the GOG, when I want a much-better-graphical version, the UBI H3 HD. That said, and with the caveat that the mods for H3 HD are an absolute must, I will say that the game is worth the measly asking price (here, 15$ Canadian), and effort to install the mods. It has given me more enjoyable play hours than I thought it would. I move slowly to a thumbs up.",1562599632,1581688701,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I instantly got interested in this version hoping that somewhat refreshed visuals might make an old gem look more visually polished. I was wrong. The difference is almost unnoticable and due to the downside of having only Restoration of Erathia instead of full package of 2 expansions with additional castle, items and limitless map generator, this purchase is not worth even 1/3rd of the price of full game on good old games site - http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition which costs twice less by default.

DO not buy Steam version. Save Your money and conscience, get GOG version. A few pixels more, no achievements, but whole package.

As this is only 3rd of the full game which has nothing new in that third, it cannot have score of more than just a 3rd of a game.

For those who don’t know it: The Might and Magic world is 30 years old and the story expanded over years. In the 80s, it started with the role-playing game Might and Magic (now 10 parts) and in 1995 the turn-based game Heroes of Might and Magic (HoMM) was released (now 7 parts). The quality within the game series varies greatly. I think the most popular game is HoMM 3, followed by HoMM 5 and 4. The worst for me is HoMM 7, so much wasted potential. Thank you Ubisoft...

The game offers you a choice between single scenario, multiplayer, campaign or tutorial.
In the game, you move your hero by clicking on the map, revealing hidden parts of the environment. After the first and more steps you meet creatures blocking streets to resources, cities, buildings or artifacts. As soon as you have used up the hero's movement points and done everything necessary, you end your turn. Now the opponents or allies have their turn. Over time, you build your cities to recruit more powerful creatures.

In combat you have the whole battlefield in view. There are melee combat, ranged combat, and sorcery possible, consider the type of ground you are fighting on. Very important: The higher the attributes of your hero, the stronger are your creatures and sorcery.

Examples of mission goals: Take care of all enemy cities and heroes, kill a certain monster group, transport an artifact to its destination, or find the Grail first.

Conclusion: Anyone who likes high-fantasy and turn-based games will not be disappointed. You're just getting addicted to collect treasures, artifacts, leveling your heroes and upgrade cities or creatures. Cities, Heroes and creatures are really fine in HD. There are more details because of sharper graphics.
One negative point: Maybe 15 € is too expensive, but you can wait until midweek madness or sale to get it for 5,07 €!


About bad reviews on Steam:

I understand the disappointment of other people and I miss the add-ons, too. The source code of the add-ons disappeared, that was the problem. However, it was announced from beginning, only the base game HoMM 3: Restoration of Erathia would be released in HD. In my opinion you only have to review this game. It is the same good old game with better graphics and still awesome. So thumbs up, please :)


Edited on 02 January 2020: 

There is a low-priced complete edition on GOG. You can get fan-mods on the internet (HD and unofficial add-on), too. I'm sure everyone knows this, but I mention it.

Nice to know: They also adapted textures to the higher resolutions in Heroes 3 HD. That's why especially monsters and buildings (inside cities, too) are more detailed than in the original version and fan-mod.",1540145600,1578003510,True,24,2,0.751186192035675049,2,True,False,False

Whilst I very much recommend Heroes 3 for everyone, consider that this Ubisoft version comes without the offical expansions. You will be missing out on one faction (Conflux) and a random map generator,  as well as  campaigns and a number of maps. Besides, you will miss out on all the custom maps that were created since the expansions were released in the early 2000s. I should also mention that there are high quality mods created by fans that only work with the expansions. For example the mod ""The Horn of the Abyss"" features a new faction (Cove) and a long list of improvements and additions to the game. There is also the ""HD Mod"", which improves the graphics of the orginal game and makes the user interface easier to handle. 
Maybe take a look at some YouTube footage from this ""HD Edition"" and then from ""The Horn of the Abyss"" and see if you value the graphical improvements of this edition over the better gameplay and ""quality of life"" of the original, modded game.",1576101055,1576101055,True,2,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

Base building is streamlined but fun. Matches are long, but rewarding (Save a few times mid match. It's easy to lose an hour of play after a few bad decisions.

It has aged well, and the HD edition makes it possible to enjoy the game in crispness 20+ years after it originally came out.

It has a good set of constraints that makes things interesting.  It has breadth and complexity in game dynamics.  It has a nice touch of fantasy and wonder.  Granted it has its weaknesses and there are times I back away in disgust, but its because I love the game so much that I care when it occasionally does disappoint.  For example, when a hero gains the ability to fly, the game can (though won't necessarily) turn upside down.  So in maps where flying is a potentiality, you need to make sure that you either are the first one to fly or are in a position to take down flyers.

Anyway, yeah I'm totally one of those many people who have found myself playing this game all through the night multiple times.  I would play XL maps for a week straight if I could.

[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? Do you really ask? If this is not a masterpiece, then no game is a masterpiece.

I don't know how many months of my life I spent playing the original game from 1999 and its expansions during my time at university.

Heroes of Might & Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia has always been the fan favorite of this long running series, starting with King's Bounty in 1989 and currently at Heroes of Might & Magic VII.

This version ist an update of the original, where multiplayer lobbies and a higher resolution were the main improvements. Unfortunately, the official expansions (Armageddon’s Blade and The Shadow of Death) and all the mods of the original are not compatible with it. Also they removed the ability to play on random maps.

The game can be played turn by turn by up to 8 local players, but of course this requires a lot of time.

Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition is still a milestone in the turn-based strategy genre, although it has aged (gracefully) during the last 20 years.

Heroes III is generally known as the most successful title of the series and might be the best turn-based strategy title as well. And why it shouldn't be - everything works like clockworks from RPG-elements to the unit balances. Among campaign there is a couple dozens mini scenarios which can be played with either AI or another player.

For those few who are completely new with Heroes of Might and Magic here is some summary about the formula of the series. You start on some random map with a hero and a castle of your chosen faction. With your hero you go adventuring into world which is filled with artifacts, treasure and resources with which you are able to build structures and hire new units from your castle to fight creatures lurking on the map or another competing factions. Your hero also gathers experience with various ways to upgrade his/her skills and attributes going from being a novice to ultimate master of Might and/or Magic. The scenarios are usually won by defeating other factions, some boss hero or gathering x amount of resources.

All these core elements are flawless in Heroes 3 and this HD version that also gives a slight graphical face lift for it. Excluding a couple very random bugs - everything works without problems on my Windows 10. 

However, after all this years we could wait some wrapping up of this remastered title, but this is where the game let's people down. It doesn't include expansions The Shadow of Death or Armageddon's Blade which multiplied gameplay time, introduced new units among brand new elemental-based faction 'Conflux' which is favourated by many players.

I myself could actually turn a blind eye for this neglect but I understand that when there is a steak available the minced meat is going to be hard to swallow. Heroes 3 is available in other cloud stores as a version where expansions are included. They don't have HD on them but I surely would spend my dollar into some significant features instead of graphical details which I usually forget while playing this classic.

In conclusion Heroes 3 HD is solid, mighty and magical turn-based strategy experience and could be recommented even in its normal price if it wouldn't enjoy reputation of missed opportunity. Definitely worth it with a minor price tag though. If Heroes 3 HD should (I've odd feeling it will) have expansions included in the future I hope that for the sake of fairness they could be purchased as a free dlc.",1472638582,1569858361,True,14,2,0.661162734031677246,1,True,False,False

All pre-patched BS, all the way through; which is why I can't recommend this! Buy HOMM3 Complete off of eBay or you will notice obvious problems with this version. A few things stand out to me:
- Moats don't cause damage! I thought this was patched a few months after it was released! If troops are walking through lava or toxic/poisoned swamp water, they get hurt - nope, not in this version! What's the point in having one if it does almost nothing?
- Dragon flies don't cast weakness! So now they are little flying targets, doing very little damage and just flying about! This was patched a few weeks after release because all they do is dispel positive spells - so they are very under-powered in this version! Don't even bother training them!
- No random play maps - scenarios only! Not sure if this was part of the HOMM3 Complete, but it can get boring VERY quickly without fresh random maps. 
- None of the HOMM2 creatures like halflings/hobbits - those little rocks throwers were gold! I miss them...and enchanters too!
- No specialised dragons like rust dragons, faery dragons, etc. which kick any other dragons @$$e$! I think this was part of HOMM3 Complete, along with the Conflux town, but you won't find it on Steam!

I don't see why we can't get the full patched version of this game; it spoilt it for me!

This game is literally just Heroes 3 with HD graphics. The graphics look great, and they've spent a lot of time on it. However, it's just that. There's no random map generator, there's no Armageddon's Blade or The Shadow of Death, or any expansions nor any indication that they will ever be released. You're basically just buying the original game with better graphics. That's it.

If I were you, I would strongly suggest that you register on GOG and buy the complete edition of the game. It costs 33% less than on Steam ($9.99), and you get both of the expansion packs along with the random map generator and a bunch of extra maps. After that, I strongly suggest you download the HD mod and/or the unofficial expansion pack ""Horn of the Abyss"". It's completely free and it adds ALOT more content to the game, and still gets updates to this day. The HD mod doesn't just improve the graphics, but makes the game run natively in any resolution you'd like. It adds a bunch of options in the user interface and even adds online multiplayer! You get SO MUCH MORE stuff by buying the game on GOG (and it even goes on sale frequently).

So yeah, I don't recommend the HD edition anymore. The game is still INCREDIBLE and one of the best strategy games ever made, I've played it since 2002 and I can't get enough of it.
Get the game on GOG for cheaper and download the fanmade Horn Of The Abyss mod along with the HD mod. You won't regret it, trust me.

OLD REVIEW (2015):

This game is exactly what I expected, Heroes 3 with HD graphics. The graphics are stunning and really beautiful, you can tell that they've put down time into this.
The only thing I dont like is the online gameplay, I dont know if this is just me but the time taken between finishing turns is just ridiculous. After my friend or I have pressed the ""done"" button we have to wait around a minute or two for the other one to be able to continue. What's up with that?
Anyways, amazing game.

This ""HD Edition"" seems to be simply a ""will work in HD widescreen resolutions"" fix, and no more.  But it is more, the pixel 2D graphics were upgraded, although it feels like the same 1999 graphics, with super jerky animations and movement. Also, no expansions, no random map generator. 

It really is like playing the original. But beware the eyesore. If the animations were smoother, and the expansions included, it would be a thumbs up.

Buy or Not: Bottom Line, if you never played HOMM3, get yourself a copy, anyhow anyway. This particular purchase is the Base game, nothing fancy in what you are getting. I bought it, but no I gots to go find the two expansions or whatever else i can find.

HoMM III HD is good for... finishing campaign? I played a lot of HoMM 3 but never bothered to finish its story mode and I don't really know what else you could do here. As said billions of times, this version of the game only includes Restoration of Erathia, the original HoMM 3 release, and no expansions whatsoever. That is enough to enjoy the game, but not really enough to play it because after so many years you'd expect to play the complete edition or something. Plus, classic version gets a lot of fan support up to this day with a lot of additions and improvements. 

So, as for the main selling point of the game, the complete remaster of graphics into high-res, it's very uneven. It looks nice in general and some of the reworks look great, unfortunately there're also many that look plain weird. The game provides you with the option to switch to classic graphics on the fly by pressing F2 and it sure helps to compare the old and the new. A good example of some questionable updates would be the town screen of the Castle, if you look at the Griffin Tower you can notice that one of the towers of the building looks off and the perspective is kinda messed up. That's one of the things that quickly comes to mind. You can also see those very dark black outlines on some monsters and some of the art choices for making certain creatures look more... clear also don't really click with me.

All in all, this a perfectly fine remaster of a piece of the game you'd expect to play. You can finish its campaign, maybe play some scenarios, probably even try to play it online.

Its quite possible that Heroes Of Might & Magic 2,3,4 are among the most influential games I have ever played. It is the first game I recall playing all night, the first series I bought a better computer to play and the only series I have replayed hundreds of times over 20 years.

It is hard to overstate HOMM's impact on the gaming industry as a whole, some of the gameplay mechanics in this series were groundbreaking at the time and have since became staples in other games

In reality, ""this"" (this being an HD remake of the original game, which is for sale on an easily accesable platform) might be the only way a certain demographic of younger gamers could otherwise access this old and by default obscure game which stands the test of time and which has still yet to be legitimately replicated or improved upon.

To give a short opinion, it is still a great turn based strategy game with fantasy RPG elements.

Considering that the game is nearly twenty years old, it holds really well. If we don't consider its age, then it is a bit more difficult to judge. In some aspects it's still great but game design has evolved a lot in the last 20 years.

Pro (as in 2018):
- The artwork still looks great and the presentation is (mostly) very intuitive
- Good soundtrack
- Huge variety of everything. Maps, factions, heroes, creatures, items, spells and there is a huge lore.
- The story is at least half decent even by today's standards

Con (as in 2018):
- The AI is worse than HoMM7's judged by the campaign but at least it doesn't have any very apparent bugs (like the firewall bug).
- Game balance is uneven at best. Some skills are useless (learning, mysticism, healing tent, ballista), some spells are useless, some units are practically useless besides some special situations (the zombies) and some heroes have useless starting skills. It works, but you will notice that some things are just to be ignored (or to be reloaded on leveling up).
- The skill and spell set is random. On some levels this can mean restarting the level until a necessary spell comes up.
- Micromanagement. There are no caravans and you need to use support heroes just to get the units from dwellings. Note that Homm6 is still much worse.
- The first three campaigns are practically a series of trial and error where you get 4-8 heroes with you, but in the end, maybe two will have a good skill set. Not getting for example haste with a necromancer heavily relying on skeletons can make life difficult. You could theoretically just reload the previous save until you get the necessary skill set, but in some cases you need to redo fights a couple of times. You don't need this however for the campaign.

Neutral
- As there are balancing issues, there is a possibility for power creep on a limited number of levels. For example with the necessary skill set, you can teleport four times to a chosen city a day and you can also extend your movement by four times a day, with some citys automatically restoring your hero's spell points to the double. This practically means that you can explore the map as well as guarding your whole set of cities with a single hero concentrating your army.
- There are also levels with coursed ground, meaning you cannot cast any spells. I needed to restart one level as I realised in the end that I won't be able to win a given scenario with the current main heros spell setup.

About the HD edition:
- It looks good and works out of the box on 16:9, although I had some weird performance drops under some sieges
- No expansions.
- It is completely stable and works with windows 10
- You can actually switch back to the old graphics with a key press

I got the game bundled with Homm7 and although I still have the complete on disc (with the expansions), this release is not as bad as the mixed reviews would indicate. Its a shame that Shadow of Death is missing as that expansion introduced a lot of fun stuff to the original, however Armageddon's Blade was borderline impossible and extremely annoying at times, even when it came out (remember the Dragon slayer campaign and the fairy dragon level?).",1536619679,1537312531,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, I LOVE this series. I grew up with it as a child, and I distinctly remember playing both heroes of m&m and heroes chronicles which I got when I was 4.

When I saw this in steam, my heart leapt with joy! Not only could I relive some joyful childhood memories, but others could as well. This product didn't cut it. 

Its not so much the random map generator. If this game was finished and you were really that concerned about this aspect, you could have hit up gog.com for the full complete non hd version. That version still has a working map generator, and you could generate your maps, save them, and transfer them over to this game.

You COULD possibly do this IF this game was FINISHED. Its not. 

Its missing both its add ons, which is a real dissapointment for me. It makes it so much less enjoyable; less enchanting than its original predecesor. It also makes it impossible to use the map generator or any maps you may have made as a kid using your original game copy (I have a original game of Heroes 3 on cd, and none of the maps I generate or make on that game copy work with this).

While this game is hd, its not heroes 3. 

I recomend the following replacements:

Heroes 3 complete edition: Located at gog.com. Just make an account and follow the steps, its not that hard. Comes with all add ons and random map gen.

Also for the heck of it, Heroes Chronicles: mini game series based around heroes 3 which in my opinion gave a much more in dept storyline for people not invested in the history of heroes of might and magic to follow. Meaning, it starts you off with a charecter (Tarnum?), and you get to see his life play out from the beginning. Also located at gog.com. Only catch is that you may have to buy all of the games to get the full experience of Heroes 3 (landscape and castle/creature wise) and I dont currently know how much it costs.

There also is a bug when trying to start a new campaing with another faction which makes you load manually the endings of previos factions campaings to progress further. I cannot remember if this was in the original game but even if it was there is no reason this could not have been fixed.

I know I am writing this over three years after it's release but that just makes it more worse that there have been no expansions, no updates for the skirmis where there is no option for random or custom map.

看酒馆，我付了点小费，酒馆老板悄悄告诉我说：这个版本没有死亡阴影。

It's a failed attempt by Ubisoft to milk the series into getting more money out of it's fanbase, since they realised they have killed the series, so they targeted the most successful game of the series into making a ""remastered"" version of it because they know that people will spend money on it. 

I must say that the only thing this game has good is it's improved art and I have to admit it looks more polished than the HD Mod and the fact that you can change from better graphics to oldschool is pretty neat , but other than that, the rest of the game is just lazily recreated and made it even worse than before. 

Let's not talk about all the countless bugs that I have found while playing this game that never occurred in the original, but it is worth mentioning,that the worst bug of them all, is that the moat you get from the Citadel doesn't hurt anyone. Only the hidden mines from Tower town seem to work and the fact that the game came a few years ago and they haven't fixed these bugs yet, shows how Ubisoft doesn't care about its consumers and further proves my point that this game exists only to bait you into getting your money.

And that isn't even the worst part.
They only remastered the Restoration of Erathia which is he vanilla version of the game. Not only the game has changed a lot in the later expansions (in order to be more balanced) and that there are also so many maps and artifacts that are missing from those expansions, the worst part is that there is no Random Map Setup, which is were the most fan of the game is.

Even if you only liked the first version of the game without the expansions and wanted to experience it with better looking graphics, then you still wouldn't enjoy it because of all these bugs which are irritating and make the gaming experience annoying, where before it never had such problems.

Better go to gog.com and buy it from there since they have the Complete version of the game which you could also mod in many ways (even making it HD if you can't stand old graphics).

I never understood why this game never got the recognition it deserved,probably too many similar games at that time? I don't know, I played many strategy games but this is the one that will always be playable for me for millenia to come. Its nice to see it here on steam in hd,you can play with other people but it is still buggy,often times it shuts you off from the play and you have to reload over and over again. Also, I know that they could't remaster two expansions,but could you atleast include them without hd? Because you get a ton of new content,new campaigns,new maps and without random map generator there isn't much to do in single play. Or atleast put the complete edition I don't mind it being old fashioned without hd.

pros:good story,very good campaign,gameplay and music are marvellous,as are towns with unique strategies and this is the game that you will play for 6 hours without noticing

Heroes of Might & Magic III is a great game, it really is but the Steam version is just crap, it feels like a demo that you have to pay for, and an overpriced demo while at it.
Go and buy it on GoG, you'll have:

- Cheaper and better.
- Restoration of Erathia, Armagedons blade, and Shadow of Death, Armagedon and Shadow of Death aren't on the Steam version.
- Greater map pool.
- Random Generated/Randomized maps.
- More campaign options.
- More items.
- Conflux Town (faction which is not available on the Steam version).
- More creatures.
- HD mod is free (if you even care about that, I honestly do not).
- Soundtrack comes with the game (that's a plus on GoG in general, you don't have to pay for the soundtrack you already have paid for like you do on Steam, which is utterly dumb and greedy.
- Creature tables and guides.

There is no reason to buy it on Steam.
Plus the rest of the series is available on GoG, even the first one, but not on Steam.
I would love if they were all on Steam and complete as the GoG edition but unfortunately it is not the case, I would buy them again if they were on Steam and complete, I do not know why I have bought this... I thought that I could somewhat merge the GoG version into the Steam one, or at least transform it into the GoG version using some parameters but no luck, it probably would be possible but it's too much time consuming so I gave up.

That's my feedback about the Steam edition of Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition.

It literally deserves 0/10 because of the non competence and greediness from Ubisoft, it's not Steam/Valve fault after all.

But if I were to talk about the GoG version.
I'd say that it is simply an epic game.

- Great textures/graphics for its time.
- Lot of factions but it could uses more units in my opinion, especially the neutral ones.
- Great and fun campaigns.
- Almost infinite of replayability 
- Great soundtrack
- Modding
- Just go and play it already.

9.5/10 for the GoG version.



Do not encourage Ubisoft by buying this, even if you are a fan of the series, even if you don't care about playing your games or not, even if it is just for your collection, do NOT buy it, not even at 2$.
I'll ask you this... Why playing a uncompleted version when you can play a complete version for cheaper?

I've been playing Heroes of Might & Magic III for 18 years, so I feel like I can give an accurate assessment of this HD edition. In short, this is an awful excuse for an ""HD Edition"". Here's a list of problems I've noticed just in playing for around an hour and a half:

I always play at medium combat speed. Setting the combat speed to medium is supposed to set all aspects of combat to medium, including spells and effects. However, spells and effects remained on ""low"" speed, causing combat to feel like it was lagging whenever a spell was cast, or using a first aid tent. This is very jarring and started to cause a strain on my eyes during combat. I had to turn on my FPS counter because the game just wasn't running smoothly. Everything looked really janky, and the framerate hovered around 35 fps (?!)

HD textures are not entirely consistent, and some objects look like they were overlooked entirely. Trying to load a new game while currently playing a game takes you to the main menu for some reason, even though the main menu button is right next to it. Seriously? Not to mention that large parts of the game are absent due to the ""source code being lost"".

about the expansions?

If I want to play the expansions, I will put in my old Heroes 3 complete CD disc into my PC and play those campaigns...or scenarios....never been a fan of random maps because I generally like some sort of story going on with each mission, but to each their own.

As for Restoration of Erathia (which the Heroes 3 HD edition is all about), the RoE campaigns already offer ALMOST FIFTY HOURS OF GAMEPLAY

RoE.
CAMPAIGNS.
ALONE.

I bought the Heroes 3 HD edition during the last 75% off sale and havent regretted it once. This means I am talking out of experience, compared to those who haven't bought it and are telling others to boycott it, without having played it. 60% of the Heroes 3 gameplay is contained within RoE. The expansions just give you 1 new, colorfully campy elemental Town (of which about half the creatures are already featured in RoE's wilderness) with a dozen or so new elemental heroes, a dozen or so new creatures, more powerful artifacts that can be combined ...aaaand thats it.

The main value of the expansions comes from their campaigns which are about the same length as RoE. Of these, the Armageddon's Blade campaigns unfortunately do not allow you to even choose your difficulty, and are super hard so you need to be a pro at this game, a king of resource management and map knowledge or you wont beat them to begin with.

And thats the thing....by the time you have started and finished playing all RoE campaigns, youre pretty tired of the game already.

I guess this is a rip off for die-hard Heroes 3 fans who can easily play this game every day for months, if not years straight (yes, there is that much content in Heroes 3 complete)

...but for casuals like me who lose interest after 50 hours, I say the upgrade to pristine HD graphics for RoE is definitely worth it. It's like playing with your glasses on or taking them off :)

I loved HOMM 3 since I was a kid; it is the pinnacle of the Heroes of Might And Magic series that started with 1, got better with 2 and reached not only its graphical, but also gameplay and story and creature feature zenith with 3. After that it sorta went downhill with HOMM 4 and I no longer was interested in the story. And the transition to actual 3D with HOMM V and beyond just made things cartoonish. A bit like how Diablo III's look and feel is just not the same as Diablo I and II.

So anyway, i KNOW this is just Restoration of Erathia with redrawn sprites and widescreen support and functioning multiplayer.

i KNOW this doesnt contain the Armageddon's Blade or Shadow of Death expansions. And I know that widescreen support is already available with the free, so-called ""HD mod"" for the Complete edition of this game (which also contains both expansions) which you can get on gog for cheap. And I am not even buying this for multiplayer. 

Hell, I even OWN the complete edition myself!
But on CD. So everytime I want to play it, I have to put the disc in which is a chore. 

Also, even with all the additional features of the complete edition, if you want to play RoE there, you wont get any of the new features anyway. And RoE is pretty much 60% of the entire game.

So bottom line is, if you want to play the RoE campaigns (and there are many), and if you want to play the RoE scenarios (and there are many many) then you should buy this game because playing the RoE campaigns is the same on the complete edition as it is here, except here the sprites (and by sprites I dont just mean the creatures, but also the game world buildings, the altars, the treasure chests, the towns, the hero portraits, hell even the resource icons and user interface) dont look pixelated when you play on a big monitor, and you have widescreen support without having to install some russian dude's mod that makes everything TINY and you support your favorite game that defined your childhood.",1514920700,1516544998,True,4,1,0.341949492692947388,5,True,False,False

It is in my opinion still the best Heroes game out of all of them to date. It reaches the pinnicle of turn based strategy games with well balanced races to choose from. Exploration and resource gathering is not tedious but rather fun as you find items on the world map as well as the random monsters that if you are lucky might join your army. The game just works like a well oiled machine and you can sink hours of time into the game all of which can be challenging but fun. Only two minor issues is the AI teams do cheat but that is because the AI of the time needed to as back then coding more sophisticated AI was a bit tricky so really its just giving the AI a chance to have a decent go at you.

Original cult classic turn-based strategy. This legendary game was released in 1999. 
Here already after 18 years ""HOMM"" does not lose its popularity among the players.

[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]
This review is based on my opinion and experience of the game. This does not mean that you, the reader, should share a glance with me or have the same game experience.

[h1]What changed[/h1]
At-first, it's just high-definition version of original HOMM III The Restoration of Erathia. There are no other changes in gameplay or set of castles, heroes or units. Yeah, with old good seven campaings about Katerina the Griffin's Queen, Dungeons and Demons, etc. But you will get nice picture only if you played up to Full HD resolution. If you want to play on larger resolution you will see small combat window in world map or something else :)
Also, there is a good advantage that game released in steam. Game have Steam achievements, community, etc.

[i]My review is based on may year of play (almost all time of game existence) [/i]

    [*][u][i]Gameplay[/i][/u]
This is old good gameplay. But in this version of game there is very stupid AI. In another words the bots do almost nothing (in any difficult). So, I strongly advise if you want to play this game, would be better to find some friend in Steam to play together.
    [*][u][i]Sound and music[/i][/u]
Perfect thematic soundtracks and other envirements sounds.
    [*][u][i]Graphic[/i][/u]
4/5 only for not good enough implement for lerger then FullHD resolution.
    [*][u][i]Plot[/i][/u]
Sandro, Queen Catherine and others. We all know well this company :) So, if you are new one in this game series better to go to wiki or other resourses. Just believe this game (and all series) have quite the lore.
    [*][u][i]Cost and releases[/i][/u]
Many people are outraged at the price of this game and no one more releases for this game series like Armageddon's Blade and The Shadow of Death. Well, I hope that we will see these expansion packs in Steam with new HD graphic soon as possible.

However TCP/IP and LAN features have been stripped from the game, only way to do multiplayer is Hotseat or through Ubisoft's online service, which can be hit or miss. It's hard to say if that's due to the service or other people not knowing how to create firewall exceptions or do port forwarding - to be blunt about it, everyone I've played with who I know has forwarded their ports, has had next to no issues in multiplayer (in ten hours of games, maybe two drops total), so I feel like it's more a user-error than developer oversight.

I'd recommend this over the GoG version despite how much more content that one adds, because even with the resolution mod it does not look as good as this one.

Campaign maps range from incredibly boring due to be nothing more than a tutorial, to insanely difficult and requiring careful planning and a few restarts to clear. The best way to play Heroes 3 has been and always will be with friends, and I'm glad I was able to get a few matches in with people I grew up with to relive those days with HD visuals.

Would be nice if they would patch in 60fps support (this is capped at 33fps, as was the original pre-community mods) and add some of the quality-of-life features mods did for the original (ie. ""send all artifacts"" ""upgrade all creatures"" commands), but overall I still feel this is the preferred package to Original Complete in any of its forms. It has less, and some people are going to see that as a sticking point no matter what, but I feel like it does it better.",1422734602,1511028472,True,0,0,0.461519867181777954,0,True,False,False

This series is one of the best strategy turn-based games ever released. 
An epic battle with all imaginable creatures and spells against hordes of enemies, in which you also need to control your ressources, decide what to build in which order and which heroes to focus on. 
This game has been known to hurt brains. (Necropolis Zombie Joke)

I must have spend my youth on 3 games
- Diablo II, Age of Empires and Heroes of Might & Magic. 
I was so excited as to what the HD would bring, however this is only the vanilla version of the game, and a lot of content is missing. 
You can get it here though: [Spoiler] Get it on GoG.com instead. [/Spoiler]

[h1] Thumbs Up	[/h1]
You veterans don't care about the HD because ""hey, we grew up with the pixies"" (Conflux joke) and it's still one of the best games in my opinion. 
The upgraded graphic is still a nice touch; however it's like putting make-up on a pretty girl, not the biggest change, and you might not even look further than her chest.

Multiplayer is actually good and easy to play among steam-friends. 
However playing multiplayer against strangers often leads to people quitting during the first few minutes, if the map isn't in their favor. 

You have all the creatures, spells, and buildings like in the old days, except Conflux is missing. - The whole diversity in skills and stats which still makes this game one of the best strategy games in history. 
7 campaign scenarios, around 50 skirmish maps, a local multiplayer mode and a map editor.

You can play in windowed mode - good for watching movies while waiting for your opponent. 

[h1] Thumbs Down	[/h1]
This is not the complete expansion, meaning you don't have the Armageddon's Blade & The Shadow of Death expansions. 
No Conflux, which is really needed against an op Necropolis player. 

It's cheaper to buy this game on GoG and you even get the expansions there. 

You can't revisit places by space-bar, you have to run back and forth and loose movement. Often not a big deal, but can determine a win or loss.

Apparently you can't install or create mods for this game on steam - I don't care much for it, but a lot negative reviews include this.

You can't change the difficulty in the campaigns, so it was really easy to beat, since I've done it before in the past #no_life.

[h1] Closing Comments	[/h1]
Still one of my favourite games, but it's really not worth buying it here on steam, when you can't have a thousand half-naked pixies. 

How to beat 10 games on each difficulty easily.

What's fun about the game is that even if it is so simple in terms of gameplay and strategies in comparison to many other strategy games, as it's still very versatile when it comes to different towns, heroes, units and so forth.
So basically you start with a town. There's plenty to choose from and each has their strengths. The towns are upgradeable and the buildings you buy or upgrade then will either give strenghths, bonuses or enable you to recuit certain types of military units, which your heroes can then take under their control as they start to explore the campaign map for resources, treasures, other towns or enemies to conquer and defeat, as well as other odds and ends. each player also gets a starting hero and can recuit more from their towns. Heroes all have specialities and gain experience via battles. When leveling up, they can choose a new skill to learn or upgrade an existing one. Skills llow you to cast spells on your enemies or support your own army, give your units damage or defence boosts, allow you to travel and see further, or even allow them to make neutral armies join you; or raise the dead to fight in your undead armies after bloody battles!
The units in the game are also very diverse. Some are like tanks, some fly, some do ranged attacks, some can support other units and some weaken stats of enemies, some heal after attacking, some are immune to all magic, whether it was to make them stronger or weaker.
The battles are fought on a grid and are also turn based, often with obstacles on them. There are different strategies when it comes to battles but the most common one is to send your melee units forth and keep your ranged lads in the backline. Some units may even fly, which is convenient to eliminate enemy ranged units  as they can fly over obstacles and melee enemies.
Well; I relly don't know what other to say about this game so I will conclude;

In a nutshell; it's like a good RPG with the exception that also strategy; you control multiple characters, who then control armies. A fine mixture.",1502578066,1502578066,True,3,0,0.5378151535987854,0,True,False,False

+Original Complete Edition had random map generator making re-playability endless, this version does not include it!
+Has Local Multiplayer Hotseat sharing same PC.

[h1]Difficulty:[/h1] 
+So many scenarios the range of difficulty is yours to choose from, making the game extremely enjoyable.
+One of those games you can jump into and have very little of a learning curve, making it very fun!

[h1]Replayablity:[/h1]
- 0/5 None.
- This remake version is NOT worth playing at all due to reasons listed below.
+ Original Complete Edition would be a 4/5 often replayability.

[h1]Overall Rating:[/h1]
☆☆☆☆☆ 0/5 Stars - Skip.
-This version has no expansion packs and missing big chunks that made the game great.
-The fans (and new users) wanted only the original Complete Edition version with Steam multiplayer and tournament ladder stats - Ubisoft did NONE of these, making the game pointless, irrelevant and rubbish!
-Here you have half a game and no multiplayer, and yet sold at a ripoff price!
-Cheaper and Complete Edition avail. on [url=https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition]GOG[/url] and you can play multiplayer thru the 'GameRanger' servers (along with epic games like 'Rise of the Witch King').
-Alternative recommendation on Steam are the games [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/262060]'Darkest Dungeon'[/url] which gameplay elements are inspired by this game and yet maintains it's own original identity, and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/226840/Age_of_Wonders_III/]'Age of Wonders III'[/url].

This HD re-release is still worth it, especially for the new-comers. The graphics are updated and re-drawn from scratch and it doesn't strain the eye as much as the old one and makes the game look gorgeous. The online play just works through steam (even invites through steam overlay work) and doesn't require any dance with a tambourine around the computer and TCP/IP Hamachi or Tunngle work-arounds. 

Yet it is a shame that this version of the game lacks of the expansions such as Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death which means it misses some multiplayer maps and the final kingdom called ""Conflux"" (which was one of my favorite).
We can only hope that Ubisoft doesn't play lazy (even without the source code from NWC) and could just add the expansions by themselves (if fan's decrypted source code and managed to do fan-made expansions, why ubisoft can't rework the old ones?)

Pros
-Same Heroes III you love
-Online play just works through steam
-HD Resolutions and re-worked graphics
-Music sounds much cleaner

Cons
-No expansions and no Conflux castle
-While in online play the game doesn't auto-expand when minimized, when it's your turn (old ones did)
-When the game set to English language and the host of the online lobby is set to different (Russian for instance) the game dialogues and names are displayed with weird computer simbols.

but the community is forever, and if you check the steam forums someone already posted a huge patch that adds in 
the random map generator, the unlimited FPS unlock, and wait for... converted all the expansion maps to Restoration of Erathia format 

after that, my Heroes 3 HD experince was complete 
now as if the game is worth buying... F**k yes it yes 
updated resolution, new sprites (no more blurry icons) and playing this old but gold game on a 3440X1440 ultra wide monitor i feel incredible 

definitely worth buying in a sale or through a gray market seller (it's about 5$) 
a very things worthy to mention: 
the online componant hasn't changed one bit, you're still required to forward ports (unf**king believable on the scale of unprofessionality from Ubijunk) 
after that you can either access online lobbies, or play with your friends in a party 
there is no conflux faction, a lot of ""on the road unique neutral creatures"" are missing 
though does it change the experince? not much to be honest 
i'm a heaven/castle player through and through and i don't really mind this small change 

the story-mode difficulty was really nerfed so now every joe with decent strategy skills can finish it 

also Quick-comabt is MUCH better than it was originally (now it's actually reliable and precise like Heroes 5) 

so to sum things up: a lot of content is missing, you have to do manual work to restore parts of it 
HD resolutions and HD textures (although some are lazely made) 
Steam achivements 
smart Quick-combat 
and i'm not sure about the cloud sync 

but i've tested it with the heroes 3 complete HD mod and this 
the HD does upscale the resolution but not the assets 
so you'll have tiny elements on a huge screen and it's just an eyesore 

if you have a vanilla 1080P monitor i'ed say go for the G0G version instead since it doesn't look THAT bad on a 1920X1080
but anything higher than that it looks really godawful 
the GOG site also offers the Heroes chronicles campaigns (8 campaigns with voice acting and a few CGI scenes, highly recommended to might and magic veterans) 

if you just want some fun time with Heroes of might and magic 3 on higher resolutions

Ubisoft claims that when they went through New World Computings files they could not find the source codes for those. Simple. This is the first strategy game I have played ever in my life and for a game that was made near two decades ago it still beats most of the strategy games of today. HD resolution looks pretty legitimate, they did the best they could, as it seems.

Pros:
+Pretty good faction/creature design. Infact that this game paved the wave for most of the epic/fantasy games of the future both lore and visual-wise.
+Soundtrack is awe inspiring. Feels epic and gritty when it needs to be.
+A lot of options to lay a path to victory.
+Online support (I have a couple of old friends who also used to play the game so we still throw some Online/LAN parties).
+Campaign storyline is actually pretty good. Like Tolkien kind of good.

Cons:
-No AB or SoD campaigns as mentioned before. Sad.
-If you are not familiar with the franchise or played the original game back in the day it might be very boring/unappaling to you visually compared to the alternatives you may have in 2017.
-Fullprice is kind of too much to ask for, personally I grabbed it on a sale.
-Number of maps for Co-op campaigns kind of falls short.

Overall:
Duckton of replay value, countless ""just one more turn""s, a lot of fun and intriguing if you have friends to play with and ofcourse nostalgia for the fans of the franchise. My vote might be a bit biased but after all; 8/10. Just because they do not have the DLCs I will not throw a tantrum. You should read before buying any product, including games.

HOMM3 continues to display it's perfection even decades after it's creation. Many turn based strategy games only wish they could be as big as this one is. What makes this game amazing is it's army and unit diversity, each being visually and tactically unique, effective and fun. The simple mechanics behind the game make it very easy to learn while keeping turns quick which really helps the flow of the game in multiplayer.

While the campaign mode is great on it's own, one of the best things about HOMM3 is it's 8 player multiplayer and infinite supply of randomly generated or user created maps. This HOMM3 HD does not actually include the map generator itself, but there are workarounds to get it working with this and guides to download a large number of the maps online. Mutiplayer can be played over LAN, Online and even hot seat on the single PC (great for when friends visit).

The largest downside to HOMM3 HD is the lack of HOMM3 expansions. After decades of playing with the expansions it feels like a decent chunk of the game is missing. Those who have never played the original would not notice the difference though and realistically, there isn't actually that much missing.

The newer HOMM games could all learn a thing or two from this one. This game was never about how stunning it looked, it was all about how much content it had and how well it played. The game didn't need to sell the armies to you in DLC chunks, people got them mainly just for the campaign and story alone. The game is well optimized for performance, never crashed and was mostly bug free. The AI armies could use a little work but AI wasn't really that advanced back then.

Overall this is a great remake of the original HOMM3 but it is not really necessary to enjoy the game, the main attractions are just the visual improvements and being easier to set up online play. Without the expansions you would need to weigh up if that is worth sacrificing the expansions additional content for.

Most who don't really like the HD Version , because all the add ons are missing and other things, take their time to write a few sentences. Because most DO LIKE the original version. 
Most of the ""likers"" write a short text like :"" Childhood dreams"" bla bla but don't even check the game first. 

So that's why lately the game has more positive reviews than negative ones. I recommend to read the reviews to get a better opinion about the HD Version. 

I love this game but there can't be a propper reason why the add ons are still missing? So I wouldn't recoomend it at all. Sorry folks.

It's not like this game is bad, it's just money grab. Ubisoft Claims They can not make expansions packs, Because They lost source code. But I Would not surprise me, if They ""found"" it and make all two expansion pack like paid DLC.

I mean, who wouldnt? Adventurous graphics, the amazing music composition is still better than most games I've ever played, it just gives the game more depth, it gives every scene - terrain, base and combat their own distinct feel to it. The GUI is very well made, especially compared to other games from its time period.

But this HD edition just comes a bit short in my opinion, without the expansions this game just feels incomplete, the only reason I bought it is because it was on sale and I havent played all the way through the original campaign and I thought it could be fun to experience it in HD. And hopefully (call me naive) if enough people buy the game, they will finish what they started. Even though I wouldnt count on it, after all, it is Ubisoft that now owns this franchise, sadly.

I see a lot of people complaining about no random map generator, the first thing that annyoed me was the simpler things like if you upgrade a dwelling in your base, you cant buy the non-upgraded creature from said dwelling anymore. This is because this was a feature first implemented in one of the the expansions. Not to mention that Conflux base is missing, and every custom game map from the expansions, which, I guess only makes the fact that no random map generator is present even more frustrating for people.

In conclusion: Pick it up on sale if you want it, it's not worth the full pricetag. Otherwise just get HOMM3 Complete on gog.com, the graphics really does not feel that much greater to be honest.

My uncle who is a huge fan of the Might and Magic franchise showed this game to me like 2-3 years ago, I loved it.(He showed me the Heroes of Might and Magic Gold edition)

Now that game I would play for hours with my brother in hot seat multiplayer games.

The reason I bought this version was for a couple of reasons:

It was in a bundle with Heroes V and Heroes V DLC

It was able to play online with steam friends

It didn`t require a disc inserted 


So when I started playing, the game was Great and I loved it like I always did but it wasn`t until I replayed a map named Warlords, that I realised that the random map generator wasn`t a thing anymore now at first It didn`t bother me nd that was until I played it for like a fourth time, the map was just simply boring, same places for castles, same hills, mountains and other. However that is the only dissapointment I have had in this game.

Start the game, Choose Multiplayer, Online then just invite and it's working.

If the original Heroes could work this easy, or if the mods somehow could alter the networking to work even nearly this easy, I would switch in a heartbeat!

Because the HD, to me who is used to the old style, is crap. The Pikemen looks like they've got a helmet way to big for their head.
I switch down from HD to Original ""low"" quality at start always.

Pros: 
1. The game looks heaps better! 
2. Multi Player function works very well! (easy to create a game and then invite friends from your steam friends list)
3. Save games, connectivity is good 

Cons:
1. Does not come with expansion (no extra maps, no Conflux, no random map generator) 
2. $16.95 is a little too pricey for what you get
3. Slight delay when ending turn and when completing combat 

I am having fun on this game and so would recommend it. I think the majority of people, including me to a degree expected more completeness. I am really hoping they include more maps/the expansion. It would really suck if we had to buy downloadable content.

Two good examples are that black dragons are no longer immune to magic, and dwarves are no longer magic resistant. Also, some of the old maps are missing. On the up side they did add some new maps. To me, a HoMM fan from the release of HoMM 1, this modified version feels dumbed down and less challenging. Battles will usually be determined by who has the most and the highest level monsters, and not who is best able to leverage their creature's assets better against their opponant's creature's weaknesses. That's because the advantages and disadvantage have all been nurfed to the point where there really isn't much difference between two differerent creatures of the same level.

I wondered if perhaps my perceptions were just a matter of memory being distorted by the mists of time so I go out my old CD's and started up DOSBox and there it was, just as I remembered. BIG difference! Checkers vs. Chess. I thought that I might be able to soften the disapointment by copying over some of the maps which were left out,but instead i was in for another disappointment. The original files and all those user created maps from 1999 are incompatable with this version.

All that said, I hesitatate to give it a thumbs down. For those who never knew the 1999 New World Computing version, this could be a fun, light strategy and tactics game minus all the minutia and micro-management of epic strategy games of the Europa Universalis genre. It weighs in lighter than  the Total War series too. If you want some strategy but its been a long, demanding day at work or school and your brain just wants to take it easy for the evening, this might be just the perfect thing.

[b]NOTE[/b] Since writing this review it has been brought to my attention by Steam user potmdehex that a mod has been released which will convert the old map format to the new format. This adds quite a bit more value to the game considering how many excellent user made maps are still floating around on the Internet, not to mention the fact that it makes the original official game map available again. Information regarding this mod can be found right here on Steam at the HD Edition forum at address: [url]http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001014053/recommended/297000?tscn=1463098014[/url]

I feel it would be dishonest not to mention that I eventually (like a year later) purchased the GOG version of the game along with Hereos Chronicles. It is not because this was a bad HD touch-up. It is due to me wanting to play Hereos but, since I was kind of alone on it, I needed the campaigns to have some fun. This version really has no campaigns to work with so I went with the GOG version and played a ton of that. 

Side note: Hereos Chronicles is fantastic. I absolutely love this series. They are a little bit easier than I would like, but the story is just oozing charm. They are also quite long! GET THESE.

I stand by that this was a good HD remake. The sprite touch-ups are wonderful. However, if you play strategy games solo, you might just want to go for the GOG version. IF you do.... check out Chronicles! I wish I could buy that lot again.

*Edit Over*

I loved this game. I loved it all my life. When I was a little child up to right now, I have been playing this game for decades. When I saw this was coming to steam, I bought it instantly. For those who say ""blah blah go to gog and buy it there and better..."", sure... you go buy it there. I want it here on steam, so I can play with my friends, not on gog.

Okay, onto the review. To start with, the graphics got an interesting update! The castles (towns) look fantastic. They have a nice touch up and makes it look much better. The individual sprites also look nice! They do have a new look to them, but it is not bad. I was expecting to hate this but it turned out I actually like it! The combat screen looks nice and everything has a decent touch up. However, if you do not like the graphical changes, you can select the original graphics in the menu inside game. This will change it back to what you remember as from over a decade ago.

What about the music and sounds? Did they mess up the fantastic composition of Paul Romero? No they did not! It is still the same great music you have heard for more than the last decade from many JVC games.

Does the multiplayer work? YES! It does! It is easy and you do not have to type in IP adresses anymore. It can be a tad bit sluggish at times, but it is definitely livable and stable. 

All in all, I definitely think this game was worth 15$. In fact I would buy it again. There is no where near enough JVC games on steam. In fact, MM10 added MM6, and Homm3 was just released- these are the only JVC games on steam that I know of. This game is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games. I am certain others will love it too.

New graphic rating- 9/10, I loved 90% of the changes and having the option to go back to old settings anytime I want sold it for me.
Sound/Music- 10/10, no changes here, but there needed to be none. I loved these tracks and I would hate to see them get changed. I am relieved that this did not happen.
Online- 8/10, It can be a little sluggish but it is all good. No more IPs, No more trouble playing with friends. 
Gameplay- 10/10, Thankfully unchanged and perfect the way it is.
Content- 6/10, No expansion, missing map generator and Conflux, as well as various artifacts and creatures. All of this you can live without, but hopefully this gets patched in. If it does, I will come back and edit this section off.  

Overall this game revival gets an 8.5/10. Definitely worth your money. I can already tell that I will spend hundreds of hours playing this whenever I get free time.",1422528943,1462997784,True,14,1,0.573261141777038574,0,True,False,False

Developers have increased the resolution of 2 times, drew pictures of creatures and animation (though sometimes a little poddergivaet).
NOTE: DotEmu based his Heroes III Restoration of Erathia - the first of the add-ons, and there was not: the random card purchases usually exist in the improvement of the construction, the protection of resource objects, etc. It was in the following two additions, but the developers have written the code on them is lost, but that's another story ...
Yes, well redrawn, but they are not completely fulfilled their task reissue - the correction of errors. Bugs on the horizon for some time did not appear, but those rare that were in the original and not corrected, such as to non-damage to the city moat, high prices on the black market, the spell flight - bumping into the castle with guards but without the hero could fight with his copy of the hero and others. And, the price is unreasonable, a maximum of $ 5, anyone would agree.
If you are a fan of Heroes this reissue you like.
But personally, I'm glad about one of the best strategies to remember.
RU: Герои великолепны, а с новой графикой еще лучше. <br>
Разработчики увеличили разрешение в 2 раза, нарисовали картинки существ и их анимацию (хоть и местами немного поддергивающая).<br>
ОБРАТИТЕ ВНИМАНИЕ: DotEmu взял за основу Герои III Возрождение Эрафии - первое из дополнений и там не было: генератора случайных карт, покупки обычного существа в улучшеной постройке, охраны ресурсодобывающих объектов и т.д. Все это было в двух следующих дополнениях, но разработчики писали что код от них был утерян, но это уже другая история... <br>
Да, перерисовали хорошо, но они не до конца выполнили свою задачу переиздания - исправление ошибок. Багов на горизонте некоторое время не появлялось, но те редкостные что были в оригинале так и не поправили, вроде ненаносящего урона ров города, завышенные цены на черном рынке, заклинание полет - налетев на замок с охраной но без героя можно было драться со своей копией героя и другие. И еще, цена неразумная, максимум 5 $, любой бы согласился.<br>

here is a short essay about what is wrong with this game.


the fact that they removed certain traits to creatures which were made in the first place to balance the weaknesses and strengths of certain castles is sad.   

{ I am talking about how in the original heroes 3 Dragon flies ALWAYS applied the spell Weakness, and zombies applied Dirt on enemies which they attackes)

this practically makes the Swamp Castle very weak in comparison to the other castles you can pick.

the other letdowns are the fact that there is no DLC.

why is that a letdown?  well that is because the DLC contains the 2 things which makes this 1 of the best playable game in it's genre.

I'm talking about the  Map generator tool, and the Campaign Editor.   those 2 features literally have taken about 1000 hours from my life so far, since it is never-ending.

th other fact is that the DLC holds the last playable castle type- Conflux.   which is the STRONGEST mage-castle in the game, it's far stronger than the Wizards limited Magic possibilities.

also the fact that about 2/3rd of the random Artifacts trigger the event ''a leprechaun offers you to buy this item for bla bla bla bla''   makes it kinda boring.

there used to be about 25/35 different triggers on random artifacts {if it weren't more) on the map. 

also, if they lost the data for the DLC,  is it then really that hard to buy another copy of the full edition for 10$  and extract the data from a regular game again?     or is that too much effort for them?

leaving that all aside, you can see though that they reworked it a bit but it really is not worth the money.


overall,  i'd recommend people to buy the original full version, as that one has much more possibilites than this one.

the map editor is still pretty fun though.

The moats look different. It was the first thing i noticed other then cage of warlords in the fortress town now actually looks like a cage instead of a net.

So yes there are some hd elements that are extremely noticable. Is it alot? No.

But after all these years, I just gave up and gave it a chance - and, as I always expected, it was great decision. So, I had really great fun - it is simply the best installment of HoM&M series (at least of the first 3 ones, since I have never played the following ones ;)). Many warm words have been said about it in the whole internet and press, hence I don't really see a point to add anything more.

I'd just like to say that I have no comparison to original HoM&M III.

If you've never played HoMM before, it's a perfectly paced, turn based strategy where every turn you accomplish something, and your next turn always has something tantalisingly out of reach leading to that ""just one more turn"" additiction. The mix of hero progression, town building, world exploration and army building is deeply satisfying and the combat mode plays like a chess puzzle of prioritising which threats to eliminate first.

If you're a HoMM veteran then you probably already own the original on CD from 15 years ago.

[b]Heroes of Might & Magic III:[/b]
Everyone agree that HOMM III is the best HOMM. Better than its ancestor and its succesor, even the HOMM VI itself. For me, HOMM III is my childhood memories. In early 2000 my uncle introduce this game to me, and in one week, I already addicted to this game and my childhood is full of fantasy about angels, devils, dragon, titan, behemoth, hydra, and many more.
As the time goes by, I decided to play Campaign and finish the storyline, and I must say, the storyline [i]especialy Shadow of Death and Armageddon Blade[/i] is not a cheap storyline like other fantasy adventure, the storyline much more like noveltry and its awesome.
Almost ten years goes by after the last time I play HOMM III, in those ten years I was hoping that Ubisoft create new HOMM which is still awesome like HOMM III, and then I thought, [i]""why not a remake of this game with HD definition? this thing is famous nowdays""[/i]

[b]Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition:[/b]
And then here it comes the [u]Return of the Legends[/u]

I was dissapoint at HOMM III - HD Edition in Steam's Review Page. So many people dissapoint with the graphic, some people still find the graphic hasn't changing. Well, at the first time I install and play HOMM III - HD Edition, I had a same thought, and then I open my old HOMM and make a comparasion, and Im impressed of how well the improvement actualy is. The problem was in our way of seeing. We grow up with a lot of games that make a lot of improvement in every year, so the classic game look so awful. [i]I think this case is same like the Fallout 4 problem[/i]

[b]My Hope[/b]
I was grateful that I could play this game again in 2015 with a HD Remake.
I hope that Ubisoft also make the Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade Edition.
I dont care if its come as DLC for this Restoration of Erathia, or its come as diffrent game, I believe HOMM true fans will buy and play it, because Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade has a better storyline and game improvement.

I also hoping that in someway, Ubisoft also included the Wake of God edition, eventhough it was a fan made. Im sure that if Ubisoft collaborate and make this Wake of God edition, the WOG edition will come out as a perfect Heroes Edition.

I've probably sunk more time into HoMM3 than any other game, and experiencing this brilliant game with high-resolution graphics is quite refreshing after playing it for well over a decade with sprites made for 800×600 screens. Unlike some other reviewers, I think DotEmu has actually done an excellent job upgrading the graphics (with a few minor exceptions). The gameplay is of course still there, as captivating and enjoyable as ever. The third instalment is the pinnacle of the series, and with the way games are made these days, there will probably never be anything quite like it again.

I played Heroes of Might and Magic III since it came out. The game itself is the best multyplayer turn based strategy I have ever played, NOTHING can replace it in this category. Hotseat with a friend, family, Hamachi match vs friends, some of the best gaming memories.

The HD edition of H3 RoE is amazing I have to say, the HD lift gives the game a refreshing vibe, reliving your favorite TBS game feels great! Seeing this game wanted to be brought back to life made me want it on Steam since I saw it was announced, But...

The lack of a proper multyplayer lobby
Missing 2 expansions which include many artifacts, heroes, monsters, game options, a castle..
The ridicilous hardware requiermants (as a person with an avarage PC and an older laptop I have to point this out)

I would still reccomend buying this game, it's worth the money, HOPEFULLY the developers will ""add"" Armageddons Blade and Shadow of Death either as DLC or a FREE UPDATE >>(IKR who am i kidding, ""free"" lel).

I kinda still prefer teh GOG Complete version, because of the expansions. 
The developers of this game version need to step up, bring it to the next level, there are people who would buy this game version on Steam over the GoG version, if it met some of teh BASIC multyplayer features.

If Ubisoft would add the other expansions to this edition, then yes. I'd recommend this as must-buy, without a doubt. However, most likely, even if the expansions get released, they'll be as paid DLC, for like 10e per piece or some shit like that.

I don't recommend people this specific product. I do recommend Homm3 in general. However, This version IS to be recommended to people that's never been playing Homm3 before, as it offers a smooth experience with multiplayer (a broader community as Gameranger is hosting different versions of the game which may or may NOT be compatible with the one you have) and it, obviously, got some nice edges to it. If you loved the older graphics, it's still available with the push of a button.

This ""review"" will mention some features which is ""hidden"", both positive and negative. 

-This version offers a stable type of multiplayer solution imbedded in the game. When you enter the lobby, the game will prompt you to open 3 specific ports. This isn't necessarily required, as i've personally played several games via the games own MP function with friends which hasn't touched the ports/their router. 

-This version is actually having a very stable MP solution, and we've never experienced any DROPS in connection from any party while playing (3 people on different locations with solid Nordic internet provider) 

-The graphic is actually showing more than ""just boosted sprites"" when you look at certain features such as faces on heroes and creatures. Half of them look fucking insane due to insane-staring-eyes, but sharper edges makes things look pleasant.

-The map editor in this is poor, more so for the lack of the well-loved obstacle brush which is available in the ""complete"" version which includes the expansions. I was told by a kind and well-informed gentleman in the community forum here on steam that the complete version map-editor actually is compatible with this product here on steam IF you during map editing in the other version ENABLE restoration of erathia as compatible - the map editor itself should help you out with verifying that in it's embedded tools.
-The map editor IS functioning if you still want to create some more intense, smaller maps, however, which is a pleasant surprise to me

-Streaming the game works great, and it's nothing to it. Very easy and smooth. Also a recommendation to stream for your friends while you play to allow for more fun during the turns.

Again - i can't recommend someone pay 15 bucks for this game if you somehow already have a functioning version of it available, and if you're a veteran and tired of the vanilla. BUT i can recommend it for reasons presented above.

On a sidenote: I suspect that we might actually see the other expansions delievered to us in a future, for free or for a few dollaz, from Ubisoft.  The lost sourcecode is probably not even true.
Second sidenote: I own 3 different setups of the game, and i've lost countless others. My gametime must be 2000+",1441657375,1441657375,True,24,0,0.628231585025787354,0,True,False,False

I actually love that fact that this game was released on steam, due to my original CD-version not working anymore. Finally I can play this wonderful game again. The graphical retouching is of excellent quality, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.

Yet, this HD-remake let me down. I was dumbfound when I realized that the expansions, and their features along with them, were not included in this remake. The scenarios provided by the game are enjoyable, but this HD-remake doesn't have the amazing replay value that the original game has, due to not having the ability to generate and play random maps - the mainstay multiplayer fun of the title, in my opinion.

I have really mixed feelings about my purchase, after owning the HoM&M III Complete, as it feels very different without all the added content in the expansions. I will be 100% happy with this HD-remake after the expansions become available, and I really do hope they are being worked on.

The GOG pack comes with all expansions and adds the Conflux castle and lots of new creatures, and there is a fan-made HD mod that can bump the resolution up to 4000x4000 for picky players. In contrast, this remastered HD edition of HOMM 3 is just the base game, minus the 'random map' option in Single Player mode - so it seems like a lot less. 

I know all this. I agree with those saying it's a no-brainer in terms of cost: for ~£4 less you get more bang for your buck by buying the original versions from GOG. I have done so, and spent many, many, *many* hours cruising my way through Erathia with my boy Theodorus and our army of Iron Golems. 

But despite all of the above...I have to say, I really, really like Ubisoft's HD edition, because it looks absolutely gorgeous.  I've only played through half a scenario so far (you might say this is jumping the gun somewhat, but some of the negative reviews already posted are after less than 15 minutes of gameplay so I feel I'm allowed) but I've not encountered any bugs at all, other than the fact I had to prise myself away from the PC to make my dinner. 

The gameplay is as smooth as it was in the standard HOMM 3 (none of the jerky movements that shake me out of the action when I replay HOMM 2) but the graphics...look, they're not ""HD"" in the standard version of the word. But they are absolutely lovely and you can tell that a lot of love and effort has gone into the enhancements. Everything is so much clearer, and it adds a lot more character to the Hero portraits, Creature portraits and sprites. HOMM 3 does look sorta fuzzy next to them now! I'm currently playing as Tower, my all-time favourite faction in any Heroes game, and I feel like I'm seeing the Heroes and the Creatures all over again. They feel a lot more expressive. 

So...would I recommend it? Yes. I would. And I really hope that Ubisoft think about converting the expansion packs in future, because holy moly HD Crystal Dragons? Yes please. But!, full disclosure and all that, I only bought the game because it was £5.99 in the Steam sale and would recommend anyone looking to play it to wait until a) it's at a reduced price - at least in line with GOG - or b) Ubisoft add the expanions, if they ever do.

Anyway, that's enough of that. There's a Stronghold castle across the way with my name on it.",1434135732,1434135732,True,0,1,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

It still has the same mechanics. It's still a time wasting game, in a good way.

REASONS TO NOT BUY:

1-It's not the full game. no random map generator and no expansions.
2-Glitchy, this might be me but it's probably not.
3-Did I mention the part where you pay full price for an incomplete game?

If they bring out the rest of the game (the random map generatior is HUGE) then by all means its very fun and worth getting but before that don't waste your money.

A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14"" CRT screen.
A whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre.
Later played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.

Almost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night.
I still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.

All this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.

Maybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.

Now imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast.
I don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.

All content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.

The unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time.
The units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.

I bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.

I don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it.
It looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad.

I really really hate you guys at Ubisoft for not careing enough about one of my alltime favorite game to do this Update justice.

Paying 2 guys to update the graphic and saying it was too much of a task to bother including the expansion-packs makes my soul weep with sadness.

I mean, you could have looked at the existing fan-mods and added some good ideas on a settings-menu with the option to turn that on/off, but no.. Ubisoft dont care about the players or the games, just exploiting a beloved franchise-name to sell a few copies. You didnt even bother adding a button that turned on/off the mainmenu music.. 

You where even willies(sorry, my original word got censored) enough to only add this note _after_ the game was released and you got so bad reviews: (i checked)

""Important note: Heroes III – HD Edition content is based on the original 1999 game: The Restoration of Erathia. ""

The information on the game was so bad before the release that most customers didnt know they only got 1/3 of the game they expected. I looked on your website, steamsite and did a google-seach, but next to none info on what to expect. You sneaky hyena offspring-conceived-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed-sheets(sorry, censored again).

An HD remake of this game is one of those ideas that sounds pretty nice, yet this product doesn't really come off as complete. More detailed hero portraits are nice, sure, but why are the town portraits more blurry than ever? Some UI updates? Nice, but it doesn't look good outside on the adveture map. The bold font choice for messages like the ones on the start of the scenarios is a bit hard to read as well.

Entering the towns, they do look good, though. The sharper edges really come to their rights there. For creatures, the updates are very hit and miss: Pikemen, griffons and orcs come to mind as pretty bad updates. Goblins, ogres and black dragons look pretty amazing.

In combat, the movement shadow comes with a grid you can't turn off, which I personally find offputting. Some animations seem more clunky and chopped up than before.

Heroes III is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite strategy game. I've been playing it since I was 6 or 7 and never really stopped but in recent years, along with upgrading to bigger and higher reslolution screens, the games visuals increasingly looked pixellated and basically pretty damn ugly. 

I tried the unofficial HD mod but all that really did was increase the interface size and did very little for the actual textures themselves. Now with this HD version, the game looks beautiful and so it's as good as it's ever been.

Are there flaws? Well yes. It doesn't include the expansions, the battles are still in 4:3 ratio (with borders) and a few of the repainted models look a bit derpy (I'm looking at you wood elves). But truly, this is a small price to pay for an old  game to look absolutely stunning. This breathes life in one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. 

However I would appreciate it if Ubisoft added the expansions as DLC. And because of the price point I can see why people would rather just stick to the original version which you can get on GOG for a small fraction of the price of this HD version.

This game is an awful tease - I'd bought it on pure nostalgia value, but at the end of the day I felt pretty crushed when I found that there are no expansions included, nor will there ever be. Essentially, Ubisoft couldn't get the source code for the expansion packs (disappointing) and declared that programming them again from scratch would be too much effort (understandable). 

The dealbreaker for me is that the complete edition with all expansions is available very cheaply on Good Old Games - there's no reason to buy this when the old version is cheaper and gives you more content. 

For what it's worth, the ""HD"" update is exactly what it says on the tin but it's not what you're hoping for.

I'd rate this game 6 so far.",1426993498,1426993498,False,42,0,0.66442716121673584,0,True,False,False

The only problem is the multiplayer... if you are buying the game hoping for finding some multiplayer lobby's and play with randoms on the internet then forget it. And what's worse there is no play on LAN option, so you have stick to their online multiplayer which is user-hostile. It seems though you can get it to work to playe with your friends online.

In my experience it's not buggy, animation can be but all it requires is the combat animation speed to be increased
This game is timeless and always will be, the HD lifting is superb and breathes life into a game that it borderline too graphically inferior to have a load of play time these days.
Has never crashed or bugged out for me. Online works a treat and the expansions are unnecessary, only way to play this game is with the Archangel on the main title screen and him fighting the Devil on the loading screen, vintage!
If there's one game from the early age of great computer games that deserves a HD remake it's this one. Way and always will be the greatest fantasy game ever made.
Money well spend and would buy again, 10/10
