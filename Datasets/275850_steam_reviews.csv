I still think that NMS is not for everyone, esp. if you're not a fan of a little bit of grind, but give this game a try, esp. when it goes on free weekends! I thought I'd never like it, and here I am now, with 300+ hrs of gameplay and not planning to stop. 
Hell, this game was a reason why I bought new laptop, because old one was so clunky to boot it up, and I really-really wanted to spend more time playing NMS. It's kinda addictive once you got into it.

I caved in after 8 years of laughing and my God, I would've been better off saving my money. Not only is the game boring with repetitive missions and the exact two types of space stations (normal and pirate base) in every inhabited solar system, but the way how things like game mechanics, from missions to just trying to buying or selling equipment, are handled and the bugs are just unacceptable.

For starters, the very start of the game is just a slog of a tutorial that has you run on a planet for 30 minutes. Alright fair enough, a slow introduction and time to admire the world. Then you get your first ship off the ground and you think you're good to go. lmao nope. The game then proceeds to spam tutorials, mission and build instructions left and right. Okay, so you suddenly have a settlement you absolutely didn't even want but the game doesn't give you an option to decline and be done with the quest. What's that? You want another star ship? Alright then, first you just have to cough up a few million Units (one of the currencies in the game). You scrape enough money for some ship, [i]any[/i] ship, but it's not enough. Don't worry, you can trade in your old ship to get a new one! So then you find one that has more space than your old ship and you go for it because you're just begging for more inventory space. That's cool, just remember to empty out your cargo and your upgrades, otherwise you straight up lose all of them!

Skip forwards by about 20 hours, you finally figure out that you can scavenge some ship from wrecks if you're lucky. You pile up a few of them, fix them up enough so that they can fly and you wanna sell them. You sell ships by taking them to a space station and salvaging them, which actually gives you a pile of items which you have to sell. Fair enough. Wanna sell another one but [b]not[/b] the ship the game decided to default on? Okay, just walk to the other side of the hangar to use a portal, teleport to your base, call in the ship you want to sell, go back through the portal to the space station and back to the salvaging station. That's gonna take you about two minutes and two loading screens and that's as efficient as you're gonna be when ""selling"" starships. Because you can't change your ship while in a space station and there's no menu to select which ship you want to fiddle with. This is the kind of hoop-jumping you'll have to deal with.

By this point, you will have learned a few key facts about this game, including but not limited to:

-exploring planets becomes an annoying repetitive chore after 15 planets (especially if you try to truly 100% a planet, which will then require you to scan ever single rock and leaf while not highlighting anything un-scanned besides animals),

-space battles are always the same nausea-inducing garbage: the enemy rushes and flies by you, does some fancy maneuvers and if you use target lock-on, your ship will spend about 2/3 of your life just spinning around trying to even see the target, during which they tend have turned around and come at you again, repeating the process,

-trading becomes a game of buying goods from a shop of a space station, jumping through a portal from that station to another, selling the goods from the first station, buying the new goods the locals are selling, repeat,

-finding any sort of upgrade to anything is just luck, because there are no ship shops, starships must be bought or traded for in stations and platforms or scavenged, and you're just buying pigs in bags when you try to shop for weapon and equipment upgrades, as the stats are not shown until you have them installed,

-the largest amount of population you'll see in the galaxy is in space stations, the best the rest of the universe has to offer are trade platforms on planets, the next best thing you'll get are outposts that populate up to two NPCs so the universe is still quite barren,

-you're not allowed to be neat because there is no sorting or searching of any kind: no inventory sorting, no searching for something specific in the Catalogue (basically an index of all the knowledge you've discovered, from crafting recipes to trade items and from animals to solar systems), none of that. the best you can do is go through your caches and just throw anything anywhere and hope to Gabe you spot what you need when the need arises and

-you will come across some obscure limitations like not being able to build a house in the settlement that was forced upon you. Just to name a few things.

Even during the event where I got to play the game for free, a mission required you to fly through a black hole. Easy enough, right up until the black hole didn't work. Saw about a dozen people having the same problem with the same hole. But fear not, apparently it caught up to me for some unknown reason not 15 minutes ago as of writing this review. Made my way to the center of the galaxy, ~3,000 light years away on the closest solar system I was able to get to, decided to go check the Anomaly (a big-ass space station you can just call in because reasons), tried to fly back outside, WHOOPS, the game decided that I actually wanted to warp [b]700,000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY TO A SECTOR I LEFT THREE HOURS AGO![/b]

This is straight up atrocious. Once I'm done with this pile of junk, I'll happily continue laughing at this game and people who support it.",1708823428,1708823428,False,5,2,0.439114362001419067,3,True,False,False

Whether No Man's Sky was worth the price a few years ago is debatable, but $60 is certainly a more reasonable asking price now, considering all of the additional stuff the developers have managed to shove into the game - even more so on sale.

After a turbulent launch, Hello Games has transformed this once controversial title into an interstellar masterpiece that continues to evolve with every update. With over 1500 hours invested, I can confidently say that No Man's Sky has become my virtual home away from home, a boundless universe brimming with endless possibilities and uncharted wonders.

From the moment you step foot onto your first procedurally generated planet, you're enveloped in a sense of awe and wonder that never ceases to diminish. Each celestial body you encounter is a unique tapestry of landscapes, flora, and fauna, waiting to be explored and cataloged. Whether you're scaling towering mountains, delving into the depths of ancient ruins, or engaging in dogfights amidst asteroid fields, every moment feels like a grand adventure waiting to unfold.

But what truly sets No Man's Sky apart is its commitment to continuous improvement. Hello Games has tirelessly listened to feedback from the community and has consistently delivered updates that not only address existing issues but also introduce groundbreaking features that push the boundaries of the gaming experience. From the expansive multiplayer overhaul of Beyond to the ambitious living ship update of Desolation, each new iteration feels like a love letter to the dedicated fanbase that has stood by the game since its inception.

Moreover, the sense of community fostered within No Man's Sky is unparalleled. Whether you're embarking on epic expeditions with friends or stumbling upon the intricate bases of fellow travelers, the game seamlessly weaves together the shared experiences of players from around the globe. It's this sense of camaraderie that transforms No Man's Sky from a solitary journey into a collaborative odyssey that transcends the confines of the digital realm.

As I reflect on my hours spent traversing the cosmos, I'm filled with gratitude for the incredible journey that No Man's Sky has provided. It's a testament to the resilience of both the developers and the community, proving that even the most turbulent of launches can lead to greatness. So if you're seeking a game that promises boundless exploration, limitless adventure, and a universe teeming with possibility, look no further than No Man's Sky.

* Great game, with the potential for states of mind from dogfighting to meditative
* The weather effects are great, and add a lot of *cough* atmosphere
* Great in VR - but with significant caveats that may be improved in future updates
* In VR, the UI panels also modelled as in-world objects, which is exactly the right way to do things
* The HUD, interestingly, doesn't move with your head, which turns out to be a good thing, because it gives you a point of reference into your physical world, and tends to keep you from winding your VR cables around the post of your rotating chair...   This would be nice to be a toggle for the 7 of you who might have a full wireless rig.
* While the game has lots of bugs, it also resolutely autosaves every time you exit your starship

I like the game a LOT, so keep that in mind while I complain below.  I'm playing in VR on the Valve Index

Things that could be better:

* Repetitious in some respects, starbases and buildings for common encounters need more randomization
* No option to skip the delay in NPC speech - I can't believe devs still think waiting word by word should be mandatory
* EPICALLY unrealistic flight physics. Seriously, the fastest way to a planet is straight down.  And if I'm trying to slowly circle an object on the ground, why does my ship end up 45 degree nose down crawl?  And, obviously, in dogfights it doesn't let you fly past the enemy, pivot and fire in the direction you're moving away from, even though that's how things work in space -- that being said, slow flight near to ground is nice, and has an esthetically pleasing smoothness when turning
* Hitting an object with your spacecraft often makes it go into full reverse and instantly hit something else... rinse, repeat, die
* Is space really orange some of the time?  You get a pass for steller cloud material, but just a blanket color other than black is nuts and makes me think my video driver is malfunctioning...
* Default controller map omits key abilities, especially being able to select color on items during construction, and to cycle through items during construction without going back to the build menu
* Can't even fiddle with my inventory while in a teleporter, so that time is essentially just wasted (sure, it still beats walking, but...)
* When in tornadic environments in a closed room, the winds will still lift you, move you around the room, and sometimes glitch you out of the room (at a corner?)... .then you're 100u up in the air trying to teleport-to-spot = ground, or brake your fall with the jetpack, etc.   One SHOULD be able to build a room wherein you're safe from hazardous wind conditions
* Fundamentally 2D control concept around positioning items you're building, even though just moving your hand out or in could have been used to control how far away the object would be

Things that really HAVE to get better:

* Default starship flight controls in (my) VR are the worst I've seen, ever, including issues with disabling themselves without warning, precession in the joystick [2024: better now]  controls that require literally throwing up your hands to detach from them [2023: deep in the steam controller bindings, there's a way to switch between contact and pressure for the Grip actuation] and then trying to reëstablish joystick mode while getting shot to bits in dogfights, and it's terrible choice to make squeezing toggle flight mode
* When using the teleport-to-target-spot model to move around, in many cases being able to just say ""go there"" by any means is good - however, the blue target circle does NOTHING to help you find the one tiny spot you can move to, which is especially maddening when trying to climb things.  It's also blocked by line of sight objects like furniture, which makes no sense

And bugs can be amazing...

* Falling to my death in lime-yellow shadow worlds while using teleporters
* Getting shunted on top of internal structures in space stations when a door closes on me (among other things) and having to try to find a place to glitch back into a room
* Falling to my death because the structures hadn't loaded yet after popping out of a teleporter
* Occasionally being on the wrong side of UI elements when opening/interacting with things
* UI elements being rotated with the frame of reference of the interaction object instead of being in my FoR (especially for chests on steep hillsides)
* Being able to build rooms in the freighter too close to the front of the ship, where only the aft half of them can be used because of some weird invisible wall

What the game needs in some future expansion

* I really love the idea of being able to build your own ship from parts bolted together like the buildings - and ESPECIALLY pillaged from other ships (so you can combine their styles in yours) - although given the flight physics being garbage I'm troubled by how the thrusters on such a lovely, Frankensteinian abomination might be completely nonsensical.  I want a gun in the BACK of my fighter, dammit.  I'd also like the outer parts of the ship to protect the inner parts, so that armor and shields, and the location of more expendable ship systems, would matter.  I'd like to be able to delegate flying/shooting/repair to crew members while I go do the thinks I enjoy more.  Finding a good pilot, gunner, etc, or developing his skills could be an interesting subplot. I'm not sure how the developers would really handle this since it looks like the freighters are modelled as locations, not ships.
* While scanning everything does earn some units and nanites (indirectly), it should have some impact on what a player can DO as well.  Scanning minerals should occasionally teach you how to make some new related compound.  Scanning beasts should perhaps lead to an ability to genetically engineer pets.  Scanning plants should occasionally grant you some new farmable plant to use.
* The logs should automatically memorize more things for you, particulary stargate coördinates for a planet where you find one, and (if inter-market trading is supposed to be thing) the going prices for goods in the buy-o-bots in each system.
* The settlement concept sounds like the beginning of some kind of civilization-building, which could be fascinating, and I'd love to interconnect them with teleporters between systems and have them make units for me while I try to figure out how to equip them for survival and profit.  I'm not asking for Dwarven Fortress here - their fortresses die far too easily - or just the cats all die mysteriously...

Smaller things that would be useful

* Tents.  Some small shelter, probably specific to a certain environment, that you can carry with you and deploy even while on someone else's base during a storm, but that fall apart when you leave.
* Devices to teleport to your nearest base, or your ship.  Should require a resource as fuel, possibly scaled by distance.
* It would be useful to be able to define a prefab - something like snapshotting a base using your base computer (omitted) as the origin, so that later you can just tell it to build *that* (and see the sum of all the parts it'll need, which you still have to have on you somehow).  If you can define several, a player could use them as building blocks for larger structures.  This gets more interesting when using repeated structures to build farms and so on, or (see the settlement stuff above) housing for your citizens.",1649811056,1708727819,True,0,0,0.462035536766052246,0,True,False,False

The gameplay starts off slow, with much to learn about how to get the things you will need to progress. It eventually ramps up into a full set age of exploration, with new objectives bringing new systems and new adventure, and with an unlimited number of them. Every system, every planet, every plant, animal, multitool, starship, point of interest, all of it holds itself to a healthy degree of variations which makes everything look different and unique.
The systems in place are pretty good to, combat, at least in single player is pretty fluid, where upgrades and equipment matter, but skill can make up for any lack thereof, and theres usually a way out with minimal penalty even for death.

[list]
[*]5 types of alliens (korvax, gek, vykeen, travellers and autophage)

[*]3.75 types of a space stations (regular, anomaly, atlas, the half being outlaws and quarter being abandoned)

[*]8 types of starships (shuttle, fighter, hauler, explorer, exotic, interceptor, solar and living ship)

[*]7 models for freighters (differ only in exterior)

[*]11 types of planets (lush, barren, scorched, frozen, toxic, radioactive, dead, marsh, volcanic, waterworld, dissident) - all being generated from the same formula, so they feel very similar

[*]8 types of weapons (boltcaster, blaze javelin, pulse spitter, scatter blaster, neutron cannon, plasma launcher, geology cannon, paralysis mortar)
[/list]

The list goes on and on. Switching colors, textures and minor model parts doesn't affect the gameplay. It's all fake, dummy, etc. The website of NMS states that it's an infinite universe. But it's not, it's just 11 planets scattered and shuffled in a way to confuse people.

A direct example of this would be calling the [b]barren[/b] planet type with different names in the game, e.g.: [i]desert, rocky, bleak, parched, abandoned, dusty, desolate[/i], etc. just so that you would hope it's something new. This applies to all planet types, they have multiple alternate names to confuse people, as there is no other value in these alternate names.

The storms on the planets are another example of faking, as they don't affect anything in the environment, there is no wind, animals wander the same way as before the storm, ignoring it, etc. A storm on a planet is just a full-screen post-processing effect (blur, color overlay, displacement, etc) with some imaginary ""hazards"" that drain your suit.

Additionally there are no charaters in the game, just dummy models that can't speak, all dialogue is written, no voice overs at all.

Most of my playtime is on other consoles, such as Xbox and Playstation.

I've heard people complain that things feel repetitive, and to be fair, it kind of is, but the thing is, everything is just distinct enough to still give a feeling of wonder. Especially when you find an anomalous planet, there are various types, and even when you come across a variant you've seen before, you still think ""huh, neat."" and appreciate the rare find.

The thing that mostly sells this game to me though is base building. I played Subnautica much more than I have NMS, and loved the building system, but I always felt restricted with my base building being pretty much restricted to just underwater. NMS scratched that itch by letting me build similar structures AND MORE in all kinds of different environments. Whether it be underwater research bases like I made in Subnautica, a sci-fi village on a desert world like that one from Star Wars, and even building space cities with the FUCKING AWESOME freighter building system. You want to build a custom cyber city? With a little practice and a freighter, just enter creative mode and watch your dreams come true! I sometimes spend a week hyperfixating on one base, then spend the next week just gawking at it and having self roleplays as I interact with the random NPCs walking around, making up a story. Great times.

The ONLY real complaint I have about this game:

Legacy cosmetics.

Unfortunately, this game DOES use a FOMO (fear of missing out) system with it's events, most of which I missed sadly. Some of them are really cool too, and I hope they bring them back in some way. I just have an awful schedule with the intervals I play the game at. I take a break from it for a few weeks, come back and find out I missed an event or the event ends really really soon. I've just made a deal with myself to just not participate in events to avoid getting envious about it.

Aside from that small tragedy, this game is really fun, has a neat story that's pretty much optional, especially in creative, and I can't see myself permanently putting it down for a long time from now.

And don't worry, for you bloodthirsty players, there is an outlaw faction, and epic space battles not too disimilar to Star Wars. You fly through ship trenches and blow shit up, pull maneuvers on bogeys and obliterate them when you get the upper hand, and watch as the cowards warp away as you go and collect the rather valuable drops from broken ships.

I personally don't have much experience with the outlaw faction, but sometimes I will make a save just for the purpose of being a lone pirate, cracking freighters open, assaulting random ships, there's something for everyone.

Space combat. Well, in general ships are missing the hover option. Hover up and down. Can not reverse when on planets? But can in space. Auto Locking is nice, but. Good for toggling to get on targets. When you get better weapons it really will not matter since you will down them stupid fast. Elite Dangerous spoiled my space combat skills.

Original review:
DO NOT BUY! Don't even think about it. It's missing about 85% of the features the developers lied about. Ring planets, in space large scale and in atmo ship battles, naming of your ship, landing on asteroids, fleets, freighters doing anything else other than sitting in one place, destroying a space station, creatures affecting the landscape all missing and I could go on and on about the rest of the stuff that they said as a FACT that it's gonna be in the game.

It's a fun massive game,  I just got into Expeditions, it is a really cool idea once you figure out what it is.  You get all kinds of excellent loot for playing Expeditions and completing milestones.   The loot just rains down on you.   An Expedition can last up to 4 weeks but when it ends you get to keep all the loot and unlocks you earned on your regular save when you return to the game you were playing before you switched over to the expedition.  

I actually got a ship when the Expedition started,  a cool ship that I liked better than the ship I had in the normal mode of the game I was playing.  

When I first starting playing this game I really didn't understand where it was going,  after watching a youtube video this one dude mentioned that it was like Subnautica and  it clicked,  yeah,  it is,  only in space and massive in scope by comparison.   Way much more to do.  Subnautica is a pretty darn big game but this thing is an entire universe.  It's a great game,  it's relaxing if that's what you want or it can be action if you like that,  or anything in between.

With the relevancy of the review, I mean, not the game. The game is crazy different, they never stopped adding more stuff and I haven't played it in awhile but I am aware of it from a distance. I'm looking forward to playing it again soon, I seen they added a new freighter or smthn smthn. I don't know if any of my specific complaints have been directly addressed but the hole filling in my base was sort of a very specific event, iirc it only happened like twice idk. I Don't think it was that big of a deal. It's been long enough that unfortunately I hardly remember the terrible launch in 2016, that was a lifetime ago, and I'm looking forward to their next game, Light no Fire? or something? I say it's unfortunate because I despise the live service model. I feel like it has ruined the video game industry as a whole.. or.. not the model itself, sorry, but it's provided an avenue for greedy profiteers to go down, which has made most of video gaming as a trend and culture kind of lame. I'm glad it works when it works but it hardly ever works, yk? Even MineCraft has fallen imo, so like.. IDK. NMS right now is the only 'live service' game (at least by technicality I think) that I feel like is on the right path to die peacefully. MC being my idea of the poster child of the live service formula had the Microsoft drama which was a rollercoaster for a time but it's pretty cemented to me that it was the ultimate downfall yk yk yk. I'm definitely not part of the popular crowd at least fiscally speaking, but I preferred the experience of the game back in Beta. Sorry, this review is about NMS but like.. yeah, good job Hello Games, keep it up, the game is undoubtedly worth the money now I don't even have any hesitations to be fair. Full price? I don't even know how to describe what kind of game it is.. it's pretty chill, I think relaxing, provides opportunity to grind, doesn't really force you to do that though.. all I'd say is that at least in my experience, it's not a combat sim, so don't get it if that's all you're after xD

I wasted a lot of text rambling about live service crap, haha, I doubt this review will mean anything to anyone so I'm alright with that. I've bought the game a few times for friends as well, so at the very least, I do recommend this game and believe it is worth the money. 
This is biased in hindsight, and I know there was a long time early on where it didn't feel that way and it felt like a waste of money.. but at this point in time, I'm glad the game is in my library, and while I'll never preorder a game again (I hadn't thought about that in awhile, but I genuinely haven't preordered a game since NMS, wow, preordering feels like some crazy fad from the 2010s now, wild) I do think NMS has made up for its previous failings. They got dune worms now :> 


maybe I'll update this again in a decade who knows


previous review was apparently from 2018!! crazy
-------------------------
Oi, this game is alright. I'm struggling to figure out just how much game there is now D; so much stuff, that sometimes it feels bugged when things don't work, only for me to find out I just didn't do what I was supposed to because I wasn't paying attention to all the scattered little details. mind you, there are still a lot of bugs, like when the auto miners start grabbing copper from a uranium deposit and I can't fix it so in the end I ragequit and delete the base.. or when your base that was made in a hole you dug is spontaneously buried as the hole is erased as if you never made it :(
needless to say some things can be upsetting, but overall, the game is pretty, the game is relaxing, enjoyable, there's so much to do at any given moment that I never feel directionless, and I think it's worth the $30 it's for during the holiday sale as I write this. maaayyyybbbeee I still feel like $60 is a bit much... just maybe.. I still think it's great. Even though the launch was shit, and I wanted to find giant dune worms and hang out with friends and was very rightfully upset about that when the game was released, I think Hello Games is going in the right direction. They may never erase the stain that this game was initially, but they're trying, and as I see it, they're succeeding, slowly but surely. 

MATTER OF FACT, there are a lot of things I wish I could see in the game that I think would make it even more fun (for me xD )
like the ability to have an autopilot mode on your starship, so that you can maybe let the A.I. fight ships (maybe have it be a tech you can find and install or even upgrade)
or tag friend's ships and follow them in formation, because.. honestly when you're trying to follow friends without having them tell you exactly when they intend to slow down or where they're already going, it's actually really hard to follow when exploring, and if it was a tight enough formation, you could get a really nice view of their ships in flight, maybe a reason to show off your fancy ships ;b
Or maybe a trading system betwen players! unless that's already a thing, I have no idea
I've been playing for days and I still don't even know how to make the exocraft xD help

TL;DR
No Man's Sky is a'ight, bro





ayyy this is the original review from release. Didn't wanna delete it so I just kinda tucked it down underneath :b
--------------------------
THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE, EVEN WITHOUT ALL THE LIES AND FALSE PROMISES, IT IS INCOMPLETE. 
Repetetive, Grindy, and Monotonous. There is no varying experience in this game, and WITH all the LIES and FALSE PROMISES it's nothing but a dissapointment. This game is basically just another StarForge that skipped early access and costs way more.




Even without expecting anything this game was promised to have and playing the game with an open mind, it's ridiculously boring and grindy. If making a game is like composing a piece of music on a keyboard, and the procedurally generated world is supposed to be ""all"" the different music you can make with a certain number of keys, No Man's Sky has a ridiculously tiny keyboard. Everything looks the same, everything feels the same, there's no progression or actual drive to explore more than like, two planets. This feels like a very, very, very incomplete game, and i sincerely hope that the modding community for this game fixes this for me. I have no faith in the gaming industry anymore. I stopped trusting early access because of code][atch and StarForge, but now this crap happens and I can't trust even large games being officially released on console, too. I don't think I'm going to do much pre-ordering from now on. No Man's Sky is even worse if you came in because of all the false promises, like I did. I'm incredibly upset about this game, and in my bias review, I hope this game crashes and burns, but from an open minded and impartial point of view, if you see five minutes of No Man's Sky gameplay and think 'hey, I would love to do that forever' <-- but you want to pay $60 for it, this is the game for you, congrats, your life is complete now. It literally never gets any better than that.",1471730962,1708535554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the kind of game that has no real end- you just keep getting better and better at it. When you start out, you struggle to get enough sodium and oxygen to sustain yourself. A little later, you get past that and start building a base, and then you struggle to get enough carbon or ferrite to get what you want. Then, once you have large stores of all the common materials, you start worrying about things like Gold, Chromatic Metal, and Tritium. And so on. Eventually, you just can't ever be bored, because there's so much to do- you eventually have to start making lists of tasks for yourself. Here's an example of a list you might have:
Okay. I start in my main base. I can
-Manage my settlement to improve productivity and ensure debt payment.
-Visit the Space anomaly and get that upgrade I want
-Look for Artemis some more
-Find the Atlas
-Look for more tech buried in my base computer
-Improve my base power production
-Send my frigate team on another mission
-Get a few tasks from the mission board on Keblok-Allus Station Beta
-Search for Exosuit Upgrades with my Drop Pod Detector in my Exocraft
-Pick a fight with some Sentinels
-Just chill.
So if I choose to get some money and reputation off the mission board, I might find some missions that require me to go to another system and analyze underwater minerals. But I'm out of Hyperdrive power, so I'll have to make some more antimatter, and for that I'll need chromatic metal, but I can't make that without copper, so I'll have to go copper-farming on Kerichus UO5. Once I've fueled my hyperdrive, I remember that I'll have to build the Nautilon, a submarine Exocraft, which I've been putting off because that weird crystal is hard to find, so I'll have to go looking for it, but since it can only be found underwater in the first place, I'll have to visit Mariar to dive in and get some, but for that I'll have to make sure I have an Auxillary Oxygen upgrade to make sure I can't drown, but to buy that, I'll need Nanites, and for that I'll have to-

You get the picture?
This game is worth its price, because it's so BIG. And besides that, Hello Games is still releasing free updates for it all the time. There have been more than nine major updates since I got it, and I don't think the price has risen once. On top of all this, the game only takes up 20 Gigabytes or so, and absolutely everything is procedurally generated- Terrain, outposts, Space Stations, Wildlife anatomy, even starship architecture and Sentinel makeup.

I have absolute freedom to do things in my own pace. Currently I am having a blast with small quests for upgrading my exosuit and ship, doing main quest as I feel like, The graphics is amazing and the whole game feels like I am one of the characters in a Star Trek show.

Exploration is this games bread and butter and not to take away from the rest of the game but is pretty much the highlight of what this game is about, Yes they have some ""minor missions and storyline"" and i say that VERY LIGHTLY as playing this game with any purpose other than exploring and base building is nearly pointless. 

I highly recommend playing this game with friends to help remove some of the more dull downtimes you'll find yourself doing.

Really wish they would have done more with ships and made some decent ships and customization. As far as customization for ships it's slim to none and outside of the ""Living Ship"" which i personally do not like the looks of you don't have much cosmetic differences

The best comparison I can even remotely give is Minecraft in space but that is still far from what this game is all about.

You can just roam around and explore countless (and I mean literally countless, there are 18 quintillion-ish planets) planets of all different types, or if you like more of an objective based play, there's that too. The space anomaly is super cool, too. They added in sandbox mode, essentially. You can fully customize your experience. Think Minecraft creative mode. You can turn combat, crafting, fuel cost, and so much other stuff off so you can literally just explore the whole game if you really wanted. I like the storyline a lot, but what captivates me is the infinite galaxies to explore thing. Some of these planets are wicked cool.

But then there are a few very annoying things that ruin the game.

Like, lastly I was refining stuff, and warping around, and at some point everything in my refiners were lost. Resources basically disappeared.

Lastly I built a base, mainly for radon.
Today I login to collect what should have been a big harvest, and my base wasn't there. Building disappeared...

Okay I built the base back, and then decided to put all my industry into my freighter. I built a real nice industry for me, ran some tasks and stuff.
Was working so I let the game run on my PC while in the freighter.
I get back 2hrs later was disconnected, connected back to the anomaly, and when back on my ship everything I did disappeared and I was back in time like 4h ago.

So yes the game seems like it could be fun.
But right now, and after 6 years of dev, it's so bugged that it is scary.
And I would clearly not recommend that frustration to anyone.

Update 11/29/23 : Still pretty much a big ball of nothingness. Still no where even close to what we were promised. I think it has a lot to do with the chosen art style, it's pretty awful.

The game loads way too slow, please fix this immediately. Loading times should not be more than 2-3 minutes, but this game takes 5-10 minutes to load, especially on less powerful platforms.
The game keeps lagging, please fix this immediately.
There is not a manual save button anywhere I can find.
Also, I want the option to reject a living ship I don't like and find another one at the end of the starbirth mission, and I want the option to ""scrap"" living ships for 1 void egg.
The free purchases setting should also apply to quicksilver purchases.
The profanity filter is broken, please fix this urgently or remove this altogether.
The player freighter's portal network is restricted from outlaw systems, unlike player bases. This should be fixed immediately, since the player's freighter should be treated as the player's base, unlike a regular space station. Also, The size of capital freighters should scale with class. C and B class should be small, B and A class for medium, and A and S class for large. Not only that, but the building area of the freighter remains unaffected by color customization. This should be fixed immediately. Also, there should be uniform color customizations for bases, settlements, and freighters. Freighters should also be upgradable. 
Ship customization is a much-needed feature in No Man's Sky, so if you could find a way to implement this into the game, that would be great. For example, there should be an option to recolor, salvage, and install  ship parts into your ship.
I also couldn't recolor or delete communication stations. Also, I can't put a save beacon or any other portable module because of ""No edit permission"". I also want to recolor the Exo Mech Hardframe Sentinel upgrades to any color. The inside walls for the cuboid rooms should be recolorable, and there should be a colored roof panel.
Also, the anomaly nexus missions cannot be saved. So even if you are 99.99% complete and the game crashes, you have to start over from the beginning and the progress is wasted. The mission could be lost, so you could lose the opportunity entirely. This makes it very hard to earn Quicksilver, an important in-game currency. 
It could be nice if you could find a way for me to get rewards from previous expeditions. I don't like the idea of cool stuff being lost forever. Maybe all expeditions could become available when a new expedition releases instead of that new expedition?
And most of all, the storyline and lore could be an expanded into a entire universe of ancient civilizations instead of some creepy files from a horror show. This could give No Man's Sky some much-needed depth.

The game is great... However it still needs a lot of love on behalf of HG.

There is still a visual glitch where you sometimes pass through structures when docking with them.

Also my old save got messed up after the last update (so I recommend saving often and reloading a previous save at the first sign of ANY issue)

anyway, now my freighter's gravity is all sorts of fucked up, and every time I relog in single player it loads me in next to my friend Fox's base, and I fall through the planet into the void despite the fact that my save says I'm still aboard my freighter and my friend Ceribii says he sees my position marker aboard my freighter as well.

You have the freedom to manage a village and weigh in on political issues or town decisions, become a farmer, pirate, build a base in a cave or just fly around with your recruited squadron to fight pirates. When warping between galaxies you can encounter random events which result in a choice to defend random freighters in large scale battles or help the pirates secure the loot. 
The possibilities are endless when charting hundreds of galaxies with procedural generated planets, making every planetary landing feel unique.

The big problem is that it suffers from the same flaw many games with such an increasingly wide scope experience, a lack of proper depth and feeling of shallow-ness once you're maybe 30 or so hours in. 
TL;DR It's definitely worth the price for a first-timer, but it dries out very quickly. Every new system added feels very much stapled-on to the last without any proper connection or unity.

Billions of customization options between ships, freighters & tools ultimately feel kind of meaningless when you have zero ability to actually choose any of the customizations aside from base upgrades. Like the shape of your ship but hate the color? Just go explore for a dozen more hours and you MIGHT find one in a better color! Love the shape and color of a freighter but it's not an S-rank? Go spend a few dozen hours resetting your game to re-roll the ship and again since there's no way to upgrade your capital ship's class!
Community resources like the Coordinate Exchange help, but only when someone has actually, by complete chance, found what you want. There are MANY colors or shapes of ships that are still missing aside from the S-tier exotic ships, which only come in a few colors (White, Black, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange). This also extends to the planets too. Even with billions of procedurally generated worlds they all get separated into about 7-ish types with only small visual changes between them (Hot, Cold, Acidic, Nuclear, Barren, Paradise, Exotic, etc).

Combat aside from the most recent Pirate Dreadnought update feels very shallow and clunky as well, with only sentinels having any range and hostile fauna fighting their AI pathing over the randomly generated geography more than they do you. Most fights consist of moving a grand total of one foot side-to-side and holding down the fire button. Ship-to-ship dogfighting is fairly clunky as well, with most enemy ships randomly changing velocity and vector to either stay within of out of your field of view very artificially. The maneuvering of the ships is fairly basic as well, with the ships only being able to land in VERY specific circumstances and automatically dodging most any even semi-lethal collision. It feels very much like the game is holding back any true freedom of control or even consequence. If you try to slam into a planet or mountain your ship will all of a sudden veer off to the side to avoid it.

The game's big saving grace is the base-building, which is only held back by a few large flaws as opposed to the fundamental ones the world and combat are. You can build some amazing bases anywhere you want (within atmosphere) or on your very own freighter. The biggest issue is that there's no proper system of lighting and depending on how long ago the parts were developed, they may not connect properly to the rest of your base if at all.
The lighting is the largest issue in that light appears to be mostly simulated in bloom rather than actually lighting up the environment. Most often you get non-prebuilt-parts bases looking like a neon sign hellscape where the rooms are dark but every lightsource has more corona than a binary star system. Some of the later developed base parts, like the ones made for the capital ships, have their own built-in lighting, but anything using the standard walls, floors and roofs from the Settlements update are severely lacking in properly-functioning options.

Exploration should be the main draw of the game, but that's unfortunately lacking as well. Each planet functions as its own biome, meaning that once you're on-world there's likely little to no variety anywhere you look. Even using the ship scanners rarely ever comes up with anything of interest and the scanners on your visor, exocraft and ship all have different uses that are all missing from each other. The most infuriating are the exocraft, which often have scenarios where you have to drive 30 seconds, get out, look around with your visor for the objective direction (since the tracker doesn't show a marker, just a vague direction), then get back in and drive for another 30 seconds before having to get out again and check your visor direction. Because god forbid you have access to your helmet visor info in a vehicle or ship! It just feels incredibly disconnected.",1708276411,1708276411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, planets get boring as a lot of them are very similar, same goes for the plants and lifeforms.

All of the updates are what keep me coming back and now Expeditions give me a reason to start over... and over... and over again! Each update brings bugs, sure, but they work pretty quickly to fix.

UPDATE: The Omega update has caused me 3 hard crashes when no other games give me problems. Tried the usual troubleshooting and downloaded the game all over again, no luck.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

Hello Games is one of the names at the very top of my favourite devs in Video games, and that even though I barely play it nowadays, simply because they understand the simple yet sacred transaction between developers and gamers, that has been ruined by in game transactions and battle-passes and deluxe/preorder editions and etc.:
It's buying passion to experience passion, and that at a fair and affordable price (the game is almost constantly on sale too).
Because, and take notes Bethesda, Ubisoft, EA and all you other companies that have gotten way too big the way you treat gamers, and honestly most of you should finally die off for the good of the industry:

I don't want to buy games for the title ex. Elder scrolls
I don't want to buy games for the great memories I've had with their predecessors. ex. mass effect
I don't want to buy games for the hook, the timed rewards from season-passes and the locked rewards of preorders/deluxe editions. ex. Rainbow six
I don't want to buy games because they are like the other big hits ex warzone

I want to buy games that draw me in with their own take, their own style, their own feeling.
I want to buy games that surprise me with their own little neat things that dont play a major role, but are rather contributing to the overall feeling of the game.
I want to buy games where I can literally feel the passion that has been poured into it.
I want to buy games that are made for me to enjoy, and not made so I have to abuse my wallet.

Nothing but love for these guys.
NMS is now the best space sandbox you can have, solo or with the homies. Expeditions are always a fun time and give you incredible rewards to use on your other save files. Not to mention you constantly get Twitch drops that are actually worth claiming as well.
There's so much ways to play whether it be creative with unlimited resources, extreme survival or Permadeath, a chill mode, or you can just customize your difficulty the way you like it.
The one thing you will see eventually is that planets and creatures can get quite repetitive as there is a visible line through all this but it makes it all the more rewarding when you explore and find unique planets, systems and creatures.
The lore also got insanely interesting over the years.

The performance of this game has been fucked up since 2016 when this originally came out like i said above its just had a paint job with random shit to do, But performance is so ass you don't even want to have it installed on your system out of fear of it plaguing your system with performance problems. 

I bought this back in 2016 and i gotta say while the paint job that this has gotten is nice looking it just has way to many stability problems to ever recommend to anyone, Seriously you won't be happy with this games performance.

HELLO GAMES YOU GUY NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ARSE AND SIT DOWN START GOING THROUGH AND FIXING EITHER THE ENGINE CODING OR THE CODING FROM ALL THE THING THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED SINCE 2016. 

ALSO MAKE EXPEDITIONS TO WHERE YOU CAN REPLAY THEM IF YOU DIDN'T GET IT BEFORE. why do i wish for this because when you put an update out and i can't stand to stare at my screen hop skip stutter and freeze Then i won't be able to get through the expedition due too horrendous performance.

With every update, Hello Games proves time and time that they are committed to giving their player base an expansive and wondrous experience, and while this game isn't perfect, it does have a little something for everyone. It can be as casual or as intense as you desire, the procedural generation is decently varied, and the options of systems you have to toy around with are enough to let you pick a path (or multiple) and lean into it. I'll admit that not many of said paths are super fleshed out, but it's amazing nonetheless that I can manage a freighter, own a settlement, convene with a space god, be a pirate, be a trader, build my own profitable base, and more!

But I would not recommend that anybody play the game. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a billion things to do but none of them have any meaning or reasons to do them besides avoiding boredom. You are kind of just doing things. No real goals or objectives. No lasting effects. Nothing worth doing but by god I did it all. The whole game feels like you are grinding to get somewhere, and then you realize there inst any where to get.

You work your ass off to get the coolest capital ship, and you cant do anything with it. It doesn't give you anything more than a frigate would. besides storage what do you need it for?

Exocraft? none of them offer anything, for the most part they are actually slower than on foot, and have weaker weapons. If my mech isn't fast or heavily armed then what is the point?

The last time I played they added small villages of robots. Cool, what do they do? Oh they do nothing.

What about settlements? Yep, there is definitely a settlement here, and it really doesn't do much.

The devs keep adding new features but they go nowhere. Everything they add is separate from everything already in the game so you really just have a bunch of mini games in an unfinished base game.

The main drive to the game is exploration but there isn't shit to explore. The same few planets over and over (which by the way everything on the planets looks the same, so more like a couple locations that have really large repeating maps)

yet again, i really enjoy the game, but would NEVER in a million years recommend it to a friend.

I participated in expeditions, did all the combat, did all the side content (multiple times). I've also owned NMS since its release date, refusing to refund it out of sheer hope the game got better.

Then why do I not recommend the game?

[b]TL;DR:[/b] as many others have said, the game is simply a shallow experience. It constantly feels like it [i]could be more[/i] and it [i]has so much potential[/i] but then constantly falls flat when looking for that experience.

[b][i]Update 15th Feb 2024 (Omega update)[/i][/b]: My review still stands fully. HG has done no changes to deepen the mechanics of this game or change the procedural generation at all. Seeing as how they announced their new game, Light No Fire, it's quite obvious they lack the resources to make big sweeping changes to NMS. This is not likely to ever change, the trajectory seems to be focused on new Expeditions and some gameplay tweaks.

I'm basing my review off of the full, $60 price tag. To spare you some time, I would never recommend getting this game at full-price. They often do discounts, so the price might as well be $30 or less, at which it becomes more worth it to purchase this game.

There are a lot of good things to say about this game. The absolute best parts of which you will experience in your first few hours playing. There are just [i]so many things to do[/i] at the start. On top of that, all of it is.. an almost magical experience. The planetary environments look really cool, there is a solid plot line and introduction experience to follow, and I will never forget the first time I got into my space ship and flew off into the sky. To spare you the full explanation, simply look at the other positive reviews and recommendations, they will explain all that.

The problems arise when you take [i]any[/i] deeper look into this game. It's a very surface-level experience. Let me go through it point by point:

The planets and universe:
When first experienced, they're cool. There is variation, different types of planets, different resources per planet, different creatures per planet, and different kinds of planets depending on the system you're in.
The problem is there is no depth here. There are no different biomes, so the entire planet looks the same. There is no depth to temperature variation, geographical generation variation, creature variation, etc. This is the same at all points wherever you are located on the planet. You'd think maybe poles, the axis on which the planet rotates, the distance to the parent star(s) or even an equator would matter. It doesn't. After a while you realize that there is a limited number of planetary types, all of them functioning and looking exactly the same. This 'limitless' universe is only limitless in size, not in experiences.

Expeditions:
So I have an idea what Hello Games was thinking when releasing these. There are other games which do 'seasons' as a way to increase sales and generate hype for their games, which also creates a lot of player interest in spikes. Players will come back to play seasons even if they've finished the game previously. It creates replayability.
The issue with expeditions is that I don't think it works at all for this game. The game already lacks content and now it's just being released on a time schedule and then its [b]gone[/b]. On top of this creating FOMO (fear of missing out) for the playerbase, the design of expeditions just suck in general. In my opinion, they're just not big enough to warrant a completely new playthrough of the game, but not small enough to ignore if you're a fan of the game. I think it just becomes a slog, and having the option to pick and choose or do expeditions in your main save would be so much better.

Side content:
I have huge gripes with side content in this game. It is often released nearly unplayable or at the very least buggy as hell. And although most of the bugs get squashed in the weeks after release, there are some that remain forever.
On top of that, all of the side content in this game is extremely shallow.
Outlaws added piracy, but it feels half-baked. Sentinel made combat go from almost non-existent to somewhat challenging for a bit, until it's completely irrelevant and easy when you get a few upgrades. Don't get me started on Frontiers, which added settlements, which is a half-baked mobile-like system (think clash of clans) where you feed resources to a location with a few buildings (which is time gated), make it slightly bigger, and get a small selection of random events every once in a while.
Every single piece of side content that was added to this game since release is shallow, half worked out and has only like an hour-ish of unique gameplay experiences at most.

Game stability:
So it's quite obvious the way Hello Games is earning money with this game is by re-releasing it for full price on other platforms.
The massive issue with this is that it comes at a price. Every single major update to this game completely breaks it for at least one platform, and these breaking changes often don't get fixed within weeks, or even at all! You could, right now, buy this game for the full 60$ on a console device and risk not being able to play the game due to gamebreaking bugs and crashes, which risk never being fixed.

Communication:
HG and Sean Murray have not changed their method of communicating since... Next (1.5) or so? They will refuse to openly update the community or talk about anything wrong with the game. There have been thousands of complaints about stability on certain platforms (see above) and not a single word from the team. The game sometimes has massive update delays after patches on certain consoles, and there will not be an update from the team. Their communication strategy has been the same: post community-shared images of the game, tease (hype) and announce updates. That's it.

The story:
The story in this game is interesting and it brings up some fascinating philosophical elements, as well as promoting adventure. I think it's pretty typical for good indie-game storytelling, but stops at that. The visual elements are boring (it's just text). No cutscenes (in or out of game), voice acting, interesting animations. It kind of detracts a little from the feeling and takes you out of the game. But I do understand this is ultimately an indie game and the selling point isn't meant to be the main storyline.

The future and my final thoughts:
I've had a vision of this game since it released as 1.0. No Man's Sky is described as a game of exploration and survival, in an infinitely generated universe. The way you explore and survive as a single player in this universe has barely changed since Next (1.5) and has mainly only visually been impacted (Origins/Prisms updates). The game has gone years now without any changes to how you explore, and no impactful changes to the core principles that represent this game. I've read the patch notes of every single update since release waiting for some sort of depth to the mechanics of this game, some sort of extra variation, some extra variables that make exploration interesting beyond the first few hours of playing this game. But nothing. All this game is getting is shallow side content, FOMO expeditions, some visual upgrades and updates to base building.
The description of this game and the original vision at this point is basically a lie. This game is a shallow procedurally-generated sandbox, with repetitive vistas that you can experience over and over in slightly different ways, while you interact with shallow side activities and some base building that get old after a few hours.
Now we all hope HG some day changes this trajectory.",1686608356,1708004871,False,72,3,0.644762337207794189,19,True,False,False

I want that to sink in for everyone here. Anyone reading this or thinking about the game. Anyone skeptical about it because of its shaky launch.

Their studio also flooded before release, they were pressured by investors to reveal more features that just weren't ready, and while I have nothing for sympathy for them it's still a dark stain that will likely follow them forever.
Then they worked to fixed it. No mtx, no paid subs or battle passes. Just taking the money from the sales and using it to put it back into the game.

Has it paid off for them? No - objectively not. They would have been far better off just taking the money and running.
Has it paid off for *us*? Yes. Even if the game is buggy in more than a few spots, even if things aren't perfect and the gameplay isn't for everyone. Those people who had hope for this game are vindicated because at the end of the day we got a cool space exploring game with a unique story and plenty of sand in that sandbox to mess around with.

I give it a glowing 6/10. i can't rate it any higher in good faith because of some of the optimization issues and occasional bugs that still haunt this game even to this day. but it is easily the best 6/10 game i've ever played and I'll more than likely continue to play.",1707940483,1707940483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the feeling of limitless exploration and seeing so many ways to play the game. It is both enjoyable and extremely satisfying to survey, identify, share, and explore such a beautiful panorama of planets and their wildlife. 

No Man's Sky uses a community approach for multiplayer play, and it took two days for me to realize it. We found it easier for everyone to progress on the missions after we entered the same multiplayer game, built our starting bases, and shared access to them, and then re-entered our saved game without being in a party using the left game option instead of multiplayer. 

The multiplayer game instances save on the left and setting a name to our saved game made it easier to re-enter together.

Finding the mission objectives and completing them was much faster outside of a party. In a party, one person completed the early missions fast while the party kept the mission selected, but did not find it easy to progress. Visited locations seemed to be missing the objectives.

Realizing it, we entered the same saved game together, but without selecting multiplayer. We did not form into a party and our mission growth skyrocketed. *pun intended*

This gave us flexibility, a feeling of community and connection as we share the teleporters at our bases, but also the freedom to advance in missions and obtain the items we needed. It also made it easier to get a freighter for each player.  We are using the friends only setting because we like to form into close knit communities.

The benefit was our ease in sharing resources, like the base storage with the friends only setting active.
I love the space battles and developing a reputation protecting the mining fleets.

It is easier for friends to get their own freighters out of a party.

You need to be in a party for your friend to visit your freighter. Otherwise, your friend sees a copy in their own instance. This is not a problem as you can join and exit party, making the game feel flexible and expansive.

New players may need an updated starter guide for multiplayer play as beginning the game and progressing was a little mysterious in a party. Despite my slow beginning, the extra days spent in exploration and mining paid off and I found new missions and advanced fast, making it an exciting game of discovery.

We love it! Highly recommended for the adventurous player who loves a good mystery.",1707830017,1707830017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I always dreamed of a game where I was able to explore not just space but to visit near limitless planets almost seamlessly. Lo and behold No Man Sky was that answer. During it's first announcement, I was part of the crowd that was heavily anticipating this games arrival. So much so that I even pre-order it. Sadly, once I gotten the game, that anticipation left me in utter devastation at the sight of the game for not even delivering half of it's promises. This is one of the very few games that nearly broke my trust in the gaming industry as a whole but unlike most...

I was always the sort to play the waiting game to see how things pan out and wait I did, as time passed by I witness not only the greatest comeback for a game but for a gaming stuido to earn back the trust from many of it's false-promised fans but millions of new fans in the process. To not only fall back and deliver what was promised but to go an extra literal mile and include so much additional content and game-core altering mechanics. Even to this day, the mad-mens are still continuing push out updates for No Man Sky. To which makes this all even crazier, IT'S ALL BEEN FREE!

Weapon targetting is better, both on foot and in ship. It feels less like randomly shooting in a general direction and more like having a dogfight.
Visuals seem to have generally improved across the entire game.
Seems like ship-base building has been reduced to functions that it would make sense for the flagship to have, which IMO is a good change, along with (OMG TY) a teleport pad in the bridge that connects to teleport pads in the hangar, in case you happen to have, y'know, accidentally deleted the stairway leading from the bridge to the hangar, while you were on the bridge, and THEN saved your game, leaving you hopelessly stranded on the bridge of your own flagship until an update finally comes out that lets you teleport to the hangar.... not that i'm speaking from personal experience or anything. XD

i haven't really delved back into the base building yet, but so far, the ship stuff and planet exploration stuff is better. Planets seem to have more geological variety now. Terrain seems more resistant to bugs while manipulating than previous iterations. Fauna and flora have more variety, there are new and cool ships to acquire, and i haven't yet run into the bug where you run sideways in the Anomaly.

I did notice my flagship bugged out after a combat, wouldn't leave combat alert status and kept firing at an unseen target while its hangar remained inaccessible. Fortunately, the game now has a feature that lets you dismiss your flagship, and resummoning the flagship seems to fix the bug.

Now, with the review:

The game is absolutely stunning. Everything you look at, no matter what you are looking at in the game, is always visually appealing to the eye. I have visited 10 planets as of this review and I can say with certainty that No two planets have me me say ""this one looks like X planet"" because they all have their differences.

The creatures, however, do have more similarities than differences but I have yet to come across many creatures with distinguished features. Maybe the more planets I visit the more diverse the creatures become?

This game is a repetitive game (sort of like destiny minus the combat) ONLY if you aim to get to the centre of the galaxy
[olist]
[*]You gather resources
[*]You trade resources to gain currency
[*]You purchase items from the galactic network/traders
[*]get warp fuel
[*]Go to a new system
[/olist]
And repeat.

Now, if you could care less about the overarching goal of getting to the centre and just want to explore planets and play at your own pace, the repetitiveness would be as infrequent.

Overall, I enjoy this game and I would most definitely recommend it [b] BUT NOT AT THE AAA $60 PRICE IT IS CURRENTLY AT. [/b]This game would be an absolute must have at $30/$40 but right now it doesn't have enough content to justify the $60 purchase [i] (oh the irony) [/i]

Maybe later on when there are added updates to the game (which the developers have said themselves on their website that more updates/patches will be planned) then [u] MAYBE [/u] I would be able to see this game be justified at the price it currently is.

EDIT: Well, fuck me. This shit sucks

It tries to be a resource management game, a mining/crafting game, a shoot-em-up, a dogfighting game, an exploration game, a building construction game, an epic and a sandbox. Inevitably, it ends up doing some of those things better than others and (arguably) none of them brilliantly. But many of them are done well, and that does make for varied gameplay that stays interesting for hundreds of hours if you're so inclined.
The procedural generation is also a huge strength and weakness at the same time. It allows for effectively infinite planets, but it means that, deep down, all the planets and the challenges they offer, their wildlife, landscapes and structures end up being too similar (but again, only after dozens or hundreds of hours). If you're ""creating"" a planet which only one player will ever visit in the lifetime of the game, it doesn't make any sense to make it in any way special.
Then there's the story element. To a large degree, this is an extended tutorial to encourage you to make use of all the features they've built in, and again it does that well, but (for me) it lacks any real emotional depth or connection to the characters.
In the end, it's best as an exploration sandbox. You can set yourself goals to achieve certain milestones in certain ways, and this is supported by an options menu with a good deal of customisation regarding difficulty and resource availability. The periodic community expeditions also provide a refreshing challenge: they make it possible for HG to curate a more original and varied experience, and they create a shared experience to discuss and compare notes with your friends, as well as letting you win some unique collectables.
I obviously recommend it, it's cost me barely a penny per playing hour by now and that's amazing value, it's presented me enough challenges and victories to justify its purchase, for sure. But I don't *cherish* it the way I do some much shorter, much more limited gaming experiences which had stories and characters that actually tugged at my heartstrings.

- make shield core for player user have 90% or 120% shield, and for starship shields 90% or 120% S with upgrades of course

-Give Full Auto boltcaster back, OR make completely new weapon with DEFAULT bullet velocity speed AS BOLTCASTER, and if you devs change it back to normal the weapon, then make capacity size will be 30.0-70.0 for boltcaster S upgrade module

-Please do NOT never touch infra Knife accelerator do not change it stats ,as had badly affected for LOT of players and for me, thats why half of the game's players 8K have quit this game 7-5months ago, but minigun ship cannon is finally back it does alot of damage as it supposed to  be, then let it be, never change it again.

-Add Completely new weapon!
 it should be minigun module for Multi-tool user weapons
 [you know, its like infra Knife Accelerator, but for Multi-tool tech users!]
btw MAKE SURE BULLET SPEED VELOCITY IS LIKE ""boltcaster"" dont make it like  ""pulse Spitter"" its disgusting  and RE-TARTED!

-also make the stats weapon, starships, multi-tool ALL tech 20+% higher buff, because of some of the stats ""S modules"" are still complete joke

Almost every single objective is to  go from point A to point B, perform some action, then return. This would be fine if the journey actually involved some challenge or intrigue, but for normal game modes, this is mind-numbingly dull. All obstacles, either planet side or in space can be trivially overcome. Ship out of fuel? Blast some comets that always spawns 20 metres away. Life support low? Oh how convenient there's the same oxygen rich planet that grows on Every. Single. One. of the 18 quintillion planets.

What's worse is that content updates have now become focused on ""expeditions"", which is basically the process described above but for TIME LIMITED rewards. That's right. You better grind away otherwise you're never seeing that content again. Sure there is multiplayer but any kind of meaningful interaction rarely occurs because everyone is trying to walk/fly/swim to the next marker point slightly faster than everybody else, since that's the only challenge this game poses. 

In conclusion, I believe this game is targeted to a somewhat niche group of people who enjoys very slow paced game play. I applaud Hello Games' effort to improve this game over time.

The best explanation for this game if I had to summarize it in three words would be Fun, Shallow, and Soft. It's fun because 65 hrs in and I've basically finished the game (S Grade Gear) but still have lots to tune into, return to, and explore even if I've done almost all the achievements. Much of the games depth is in the writing and alien encounters but there is a ton of hidden content to discover as long as you avoid online spoilers.

It's shallow like the not-so-deep end of the pool which makes it a great casual experience even in permanent death difficulty. You never truly get past the early game which I think adds high value to the time you spend building as there is a lot of functionality to base building. I really wish you could remove the Mining Laser from some multi-tools since it gets in the way if you like using one multi-tool for exploring and another for combat.

It's soft difficulty is the only thing I think makes this a sleepy game, but not a bad one; The best metaphor I can use to compare the challenge of this game is it is like punching a bean-bag with the force of punching-bag. It lacks end game Field-Bosses or Challenge. Sentinels are a great hint to the difficulty missing with Alien Encounters.

I play SSF (solo Self-Found) only now.

My main issue when I played multi-player is that, if your no quick enough during the Expeditions, it can be very hard to find an ideal place to build a base on the planets where you need a base for ease of travel or resource mining. Some expeditions I have had to skip because of this, so I stopped playing them, 3 years ago... 

BUGS = the are many long standing bugs in this game that have been in the game for years, the developers are aware but either don't seem to care or cannot fix them... either / or they still exist.  There are too many to list here.

There is one bug / issue that I want to mention.  There is a way to get unlimited resources.  this bug / exploit has been in the game for several years and once you find out how to do, it kind of ruins the game OR you can just ignore and spend too many hours grinding for various rare resources.

Issues = 
Bright Lights / Flashes = these in the game in plentiful supply. there is no way to turn these off so if your sensitive to these, be aware. you may need to change your monitor settings.
Sound = very limited control over how much of what sound you can hear.  For example, I cannot handle the sound of the jet-pack, but I cant turn this specific sound down / off
When you get to mine various resources/gases, you can only build a certain number of storage containers for it, which means you have to collect every day, or ""lose"" out on auto-generated resources.
Some Resource are required in great quantity but are very rare, which means you have to spend 4 hours farming to get enough of it for one days worth of missions...(see above)
Ships = when you find a new ship but do not want to take it as your main ship, the game does not want you that you will lose the position of your main ship.  make sure your main ship is right next to you BEFORE you swap. 
Vehicles = you very limited upgrades the various vehicles, eventually, all of the vehicles end up with the exact same upgrades because there are so few and you cannot expand the inventory (unlike your own and your ships)
You only get one save per game file.  you cannot ""save as""
New saves games go to the TOP be careful when deleting, I lost a 350+ hour because of this. you cannot retrieve delete data.!

All The Good =
Solo Play, friends only play, or open multiplayer play.
Regular free major content updates
No P2W
the options for building is awesome, and once you unlock all of the things to build (available by grinding in game currency) you can build truly magnificent massive structures.  my current save is about 400 hours, 150 hrs of that is just building bigger / better bases. oops ;)
great custom building for ships, weapons and freighters.
You can either have your main base on a planet OR have it one a Freighter, or both :)
Unlimited exploration. (this could also be a bad thing, depending on your personal preference)

Overall I love this game, the only really bad thing about it is the long-standing bugs and unlimited resources bug / exploit.

The game has evolved significantly through continuous updates since its launch, improving and expanding its features comprehensively.

Gameplay in NMS is unique, centered around exploration, survival, trading, and combat across procedurally generated galaxies. The game delivers an unprecedented sense of scale, with over 18 quintillion planets each hosting unique flora, fauna, and landscapes. Players engage in discovering new species, mining resources, space or ground combat, and interacting with alien races. The introduction of base building, underwater exploration, and land vehicles in updates has enriched gameplay, allowing deeper personalization of the journey.

The graphics and sound design of NMS are remarkable. The vibrant color palette and art style evoke classic science fiction, creating a sense of wonder. Procedural generation ensures each planet offers a new visual and auditory experience, complemented by an ambient soundtrack by 65daysofstatic, which enhances the immersive exploration.

Hello Games has shown a strong commitment to improving NMS through numerous free updates, including Foundation, Beyond, Origins, and Frontiers. These updates have expanded features, introduced multiplayer, enhanced base building, added new story content, and increased planet diversity, revitalizing the game and its community.

The NMS community has been crucial to the game's evolution, sharing discoveries, organizing events, and contributing to a knowledge database. Multiplayer allows exploration together, trading, combat, and building communities on distant worlds. Hello Games supports this community spirit with in-game events and challenges.

Despite a controversial launch, NMS has become a success story of redemption in the gaming industry, showcasing the importance of developer-community engagement and the evolution potential post-launch.

NMS is more than a game; it's a vast universe offering endless exploration and adventure possibilities. Its transformation over the years highlights Hello Games' dedication to their vision and players. With exploration, survival, and community at its core, NMS exemplifies the potential of video games to provide not only entertainment but also deeply personal and evolving experiences. Whether charting unknown planets or building bases with friends, NMS offers a universe of possibilities waiting to be discovered.",1707525974,1707525974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worlds, and systems are beautiful. Flying around to different systems to see the make up of planets really has it's charm. During my adventure's I came across ""rare"" base decorations you could pick up from planets for placement in your base. This small addition adds to the exploration experience and should show what you can find. 

The factions/races are well thought out and fun to interact with. Each with their own specialties in markets and technology. However, it would be nice to see more races or unique interactions. It does boil down to the same things being repeated. 

Combat leaves plenty to be desired, but the game is not punishing enough to harm you for it.  Plenty of upgrades and directions to take your multi-tool or star fighter. Again these end up being limited in the end. Star fighting is satisfying but could do with a bit more ""realism"", in the sense of I want more ability and control to dog fight enemies, locking on and shooting has its limits. 

I could go into more depth with many of the systems in game. At the end of the day it has an endless mid game. Everything you collect or gather is upgrading and min maxing the gear that mostly serves it duty. However, you're not going to encounter any boss, or raid like challenge in the game. Sure, there are a couple of cool events, but again not enough challenge to warrant the min maxing of gear. Example, S-class solar ship with half the dps of my fighter took out a pretty large ship with a few shield recharges. 

Now, the biggest negative. I got this game to play with a couple of buddies on the side of our fps gaming. We all started out playing together find, but as time went on we no longer could join each other. It was as if our characters were invalid to load into our friend lobby with. The selection option was grayed. This was not the only issue, as we encountered different weather in the same location on a planet. It was clear this was a ""multiplayer"" game. 

In the end we spent hours trying to work around the issue to play together. The problem was, as I stated to my buddies ""to what end anyway, what we can do and experience together is highly limited"". With no end game raids or bosses, and the only direct multiplayer experience being Nexus events. The lack of server side weather or experiences and more. Multiplayer is not really a viable option. 

I would even go so far as to say, with no in game invite system, no way to meet up outside of a group at the nexus, inconsistent joining sessions, and lack of server side events. This game should not be advertising as a multi-player experience at all.

No, mixing a triceratops head with a chicken body and wolf legs, then on another planet a triceratops body with chicken legs and wolf head, all of them being the same brown-green colors (despite earth's real fauna being extremely colored) is NOT a mark of creativity nor imagination. 
A lot of different words to describe the same worlds that differ only by the type of head the common local brown-green cow wears.
NMS is the embodiment of ""quantity over quality"" proverb. Story is bad. Characters are bad and shallow. Everything is repetitive to death. Everything is made to make you loose time and unecessarily multiply the numbers of clicks and small waiting times needed to get something done. Even after having installed numerous QoL mods I still had this feeling.

Not a bad way to kill time. Inventory management has gotten much better with updates but it can still sometimes be a chore. The base building aspect shines since there's a bunch of environmental hazards on planets, so constructing a functioning base is not only good for your longevity but also adds in a bit of customization akin to minecraft. Character controls are smooth, so are the starship flight operations and ground vehicles/submersibles. Also must mention how the seamless movement from orbit to planet and vice versa makes such a significant difference compared to a jarring loading screen. This is something I never thought I needed so much in my space exploration games since it stops immersion from being regularly shattered by a wrecking ball. 

However this is not a very deep or story-heavy game. It's technically there if you want, but most of the time you'll be cruising around with your ship or jetpack trying to gather resources and build.

But they recovered the bag and have not fumbled it since! Every update has added something that enhances the quality of life for players and makes the game more in-depth, fun, and worth coming back to. 

I play on a taped together craptop, but it runs fine for my specs. If you have a decent PC, it'll look great and you'll probably get >60fps at least. 

The only hang-up I have about this game is the progression in Survival mode being a little bit repetitive at times. I'll want to progress the story (which is very well written btw), but first you have to fly your ship to your local station, buy some Microprocessors, Salt, and Uranium-235 to complete the crafting blueprint for a suspiciously salty Nuclear Bomb that can also probably run Doom on its Samsung smart-fridge display. Then once you've talked to the person you wanted to, you have to do it all again. However, without that gameplay loop, it really wouldn't feel like you earn anything. Also, running errands in this game is just jaw-droppingly beautiful. It doesn't matter if you're orbiting Planet Piss, the sun's light will bounce off the surface of the oceans and give you a golden shower of glorious light on the bridge of your Star Freighter.

TL;DR: This game is very fun, but sometimes doing questline type stuff can be a little tedious. But it's not like you're required to do any of that. Plus, there's also a creative mode if you feel like just exploring and getting everything for free. Also the game is visually stunning.",1707306484,1707306484,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been following it for a while, however, and I can say that now it’s worth every penny you pay. I was initially drawn in by the style - reminiscent of the covers of classic sci-fi novels. Without getting too much into spoilers, the game very much feels like a story that comes from that same era - if you’re like me, the game’s already for you. 

As of this review, my playtime (100ish hours) is what you’d expect for a single player run to the endgame. However, one of the special things about this game is that it never really ends - I’m going to have a lot of fun yet with that first save file. 

No Man’s Sky  is “quick detour: the game”  - And I love it for that. I set out to assemble a submarine, and I ended up diving deep into a horrifying derelict freighter. It’s the most authentic exploration game I’ve ever played, and Hello Games remains dedicated to making that experience even better. 

I’ll admit, it has its flaws… for starters, the tutorial section is pretty long-winded if you don’t know what you’re doing. uncovering the story’s mystery and the experience of a new game is what kept me going, but for others it might be a problem. Multiplayer is also kept locked until it’s over, so if you want to play with friends quickly it might put a kink in things, depending on how quickly you can guide them through it. And though the game is constantly updated, it can get a little repetitive if you’re not hunting for the perfect equipment. 

The game is also very open - it can be a chill exploration game, but it also has aspects which can fit most palettes - combat, a little bit of horror, trading (albeit limited), messing around with friends, building a base or settlement, you name it.

I died for the first time in a multiplayer setting and noticed that my inventory was gone and marked at where I died. All I could hope for was that they didn't ninja my inventory and they blast me again and it's gone. It's gone, and my starship is destroyed.

This Game is a fucking piece of dogshit, completely fucking bugged and sometimes unplayable. Fucking shitgame, im in this weekly mission where u loose ur progress when you are restarting, and now my fucking game is so completely fucking bugged that i cant even edit my own fucking base. Fucking anomaly detector is also not working, fucking disgusting shitgame. The biggest joke of all is that the ingame currency u get from daily missions, is only available on the account u made the missions and bought the cosmetics. So if you make a new account or lost ur old one and made a new one, all your progress is lost and you have to farm everything again. Absolutely fucking disgusting game design, fucking shitgame. And ofc in the fucking nexus are missions shown which you cant even fucking manage to finish, fucking shitgame. This piece of dogshit wouldnt be that dumb if you could keep all the stuff from the nexus u once grinded for, but ofc with every new safegame you have to grind all over again, fucking digusting shitgame mechanics, fucking stupid. How the fuck do u even get on such fucked up shitty ideas

Also super fucked up is that the fucking button for ""cancel mission"" is on the same position as the fucking ""complete mission"" button after u grinded ur ass off for this damn nexus mission. And ofc, the game is so fucking slow that when u finished a mission the progress didnt got up with ur fucking speed and then u abord the fucking mission because of that fucking button. If you would have waited 5 more seconds or something the fucking button would change to ""complete mission"". Fucking disgusting  shitgame, i hope these retardo devs will fix this issue this is completely fucked up that u grind ur ass off for a damn nexus mission and then when u actually already finished it, you abord it. Absolutely fucking digusting shitgame

Nice Game but super disappointing Bugs and Problems.
I couldnt use my PC for a longer time so I used my laptop and started a new safe there for the new Expedition. I finished the Expedition and the gamemode got turned into a normal gamemode. When I started the game on my Desktop PC after I could use it again, no progress from my Laptop was saved or synchronized. I contancted support, no anwer. I even tried to search for help on Reddit and it didnt worked.

I copied the game files from my Laptop and uploaded them on Google Drive, then downloaded them and pasted them into the games folder, but it didnt worked. I spend the whole night unmtil 6 AM trying to fix it, all my efforts were worthless.

I made Backups via Steams from my Laptop safegame and tried to paste them, didnt work. Steam didnt found any backups, but I even did them via Steam... Super Disappointing. All my Progress on my Laptop is lost forever, RIP extra 200 hours spend. Steam said that the steam cloud is up to date, but that was a lie. Dont buy this game if you dont waste a lot of time.

I continue to play and enjoy NMS every time they release a new expedition.  If you are a new player, there is a ton of content to experience and explore from past expeditions that have released new content into the game.  Definitely worth the money, as the game gives you everything that Starfield should have but failed to deliver on.  

I have about 500h on PS4 and PS5 in addition to ~80h on PC.  The best part about this game are the Expeditions, I would have given up NMS if not for the expeditions, so if you haven't been doing those, you have been missing out.  They provide a fresh way to play the game outside of the normal mechanics.  NMS is lots of fun until you hit max level (fully upgraded Exo, S class ships, Freighter, etc.) and then there isn't really much to do.  The missions aren't really meaningful, the base building is fine, but if you really try to go all out, you will start having crashes.  The game has a lot of potential still in it.  I had hoped that the settlements expansion would be deeper but it was mostly wasted potential.  I would have liked to see a settlement system like Fallout 4 where you have fully realized individual settlers who have quests and will reward you and improve and change individually as you help them out.  Settlements as they are are extremely limited and generic with little benefit and not much to do other than kill a few sentinels now and then.

Graphics:
The graphics on NMS are great, the lush planets at night, the caves, they all look amazing.

Music: 
The music in NMS is just about right.  It hits when it should but is not overbearing when it shouldn't be.

Base Building:
The base building is great, my only complaint is lag and crashes if you make your base too big.

Story:
The original story of the game is pretentious nonsense and honestly, with the framework that they have for the Expeditions, they should just completely retcon the original story and make it more meaningful.  I get the whole procedurally generated intent, but the reality is that its fine for terrain, rocks and plants, but it leaves a lot to be desired for story and interactions.  NMS would be much better served to do an expansion that wipes out the original story and gives us a really good, hard core science fiction story, maybe add a few more new humanoid races with capitol cities.  As it stands, the universe feels really empty and impersonal at max level.  All that procedurally generated content is a mile wide and an inch deep.

Found a Paradise plant after 1 month of game play and finding all 16 glyphs. Decided to claim a piece of land next to a lake and build my dream base. Because the base was next to water and an energy source everything was perfect. Unlimited energy and an underwater base below my home. I was so happy. 

Logged into No Mas Sky today and all of the base, that took me hour to to carve out of cave wall, is encased in rock. 10 levels. All of it encased. I tried to carve it out with the multi tool.

Old Review:

Start Game up
Have to  wait for stupid logos, can't press escape to stop them.
Menu loads. Everything feels like a PS4 or xbox interface, it's stupid as F.
Game loads, the stars thing looks kinda cool.
I'm now staring at the sky in some interesting world, cool.
Have to wait for an absolutely stupid cinematic animation... I just want to start playing.
Finally can move. 
Start game. Game feels and looks pretty good. Wow this is gonna be amazing.
Follow instructions, I've got the correct mineral... can't  find the scanner to repair it. 
It's freezing. Scanner is no where around me.
I'm running around like an idiot,  squinting into my screen trying to find the scanner.
I Die. Have to stare at a stupid quote for a few minutes.

- The game is beautiful. The different Nebulae, the planets, the suns and overall visuals are superb. Really gives the exploring/immersion feeling a good boost. 
- Diversity is where the game truly shines. Sure, the pool from which the procedural generation picks is limited, but the combinations and overall spread of the different things you can find and catalog is superb. Collect ships, companions, freighters and invest hundreds of hours to fit and max them, fly them in adventures and see the galaxy.
- Good exploration sim.
- A lot of stuff to do with a scope in mind and completion goals. 
- Superb base designs. 
- Huge game, you will find places to call ""home"" and they will be beautiful.
- Music or should I say atmosphere is awesome. One of the best parts for me. 
- Great content with pirate dreads and alien like derelict explorations. Good immersion and feeling. 
- More ship slots! More freighters needed! I want to own a space armada please!

Cons: (this will hurt but every point here felt like a slap over the head when I played).
- The name of the game is Grind. Not because you have to slave away to have anything, but because you have to do the same thing tens/hundreds of times to reach the wanted result.
- The Click Hell! Want to skip over the same conversation 300th time? Click 20 times to fast force every sentence that slowly displays in the convo window. Alternatively, you will be taken out of vendor menu's so you have to reclick everything to get back, even thou you weren't finished! Click click click to skip everything, EXCEPT the entire conversation. Open again a lore journal by mistake? Start clicking to skip each sentence again. 30 clicks, done..Oh...another journal over there! Why the Hell are you being taken out of npc convo menus after each option you chose!?
- The difficulty is trivial. Even in the endgame content, there is no real danger. You get awesome ships armed to the teeth, a personal fleet, full rack of weapons, and you blast through derelict freighters with only an upgraded mining beam. 
- Horrible mechanic for scanning everlasting energy/resource nodes. In order to get the S-tier ones, you have to drive like a cretin in the same direction and scan. Hours upon hours of samey landscape where you just push a button to see if any RNG generated S-tier nodes are around you. WRONG! You have to spice up this torment by dismounting your vehicle hundreds of times because you cannot use the scanner while driving! It makes no sense! Why can't you use the scanner while flying/driving? 
- You can't change ship on station, you can't change the order of the ship you are being given after a scrap/sale. So get ready to teleport/fly around no one knows how many times because you are just not allowed on stations where you actually need to. 
- Map Cancer. The map is simply cancer. You want to set a waypoint? Hah! You see the road map only on locked view. Want to plan a trip? Get out in space, is the only place you can access the map! Besides this, the 3d map is so bad. Background colors change, systems overlap, you can't plot a course to a system you haven't visited, filter is simplistic, and you can't spin a 3d map. Good luck trying to pinpoint a system if you don't aim it perfectly with the center of your screen. Good luck trying to get anything to display unless you center it perfectly while flying.
- The Bugs. OMG, it's been 8 years already and still annoying bugs. 
  - terrain regrowing over your base.
  - falling through terrain and map
  - base registering screws the snap on base modules. All you can do is erase the entire base to make the modules snap and register the location on the same spot again, otherwise the game will not see your base as actually there, hence things won't snap anymore.
  - missions not registering progression. 
  - missions that ask impossible to achieve requirements (scan 12 flowers on a planet with no flowers)
  - things that display for me, do not display for my friends in multiplayer
  - resetting encounters with invisible enemies, etc
My gf quit on the game when all her inventory vanished during a Nexus mission losing rare items and tens of hours of progress getting them. 
- Multiplayer is NOT multiplayer. Sure, you can do missions with a friend, and battle sentinels or be a pirate (if you are lucky to see the same things on screen), but the multiplayer part (the reason why I bought the game with my gf) is not really there. Missions are trivial even on single player, so another person in your team just makes the ordeal go faster. Unless the game bugs and you get different requirements for the same mission :)) You can't use the same base unless the owner is online and ON SITE. You can't share the storage, you can't trade ships and ""unboxed"" modules (why???), You can't even build a shared base in the same spot. And while this is great for PVE and getting rid of thieves/griefers, it kills the coop game play and I feel scammed. 
- PVP is trivial and basically non existent. The NMS community is a hippie commune. The game itself is risk averse. There is no risk, no sweat, little skill involved and no punishment for failure on Normal. Hell, you only get tricked into pvp if you don't un-check a box. Even the predatory animals are slow! 
- I didn't care for the writing or the story. It's allover the place and the quests are 99% fetch quests. The mission UI is a mess also. Deselecting your missions when you enter ship, not giving clear checkpoints and making you resort to the messy galaxy map (accessible only while in space). But it's not why I played the game to begin with. The worst part is even if there is a large diversity of missions, their only goal is grind. Progressions IS GRIND. And they are RANDOM. You can't even grind what you need as a dedicated goal. Maybe this game session no missions with the rewards you need will spawn! Progression is therefore locked behind RNG, and that's a middle finger if you value your time. So get ready to check reddit for fastest ways to get through that grind faster! 
- the bases looks beautiful, and I've seen some incredible builds. Really jaw dropping material. The bad part, is that more than 50% of all the modules you can build in your base, are cosmetic only. There's no point going the extra mile. Some basic rooms/greenhouses/utilities and you are set for the rest of the game and fully outfitted. 
- The goal of many venues of game play mechanics is to give you money. Top tier farms for top tier minerals, rare plantations and expeditions providing with the rarest items, all have one utility - money. You can build entire bases by buying the materials off market, and it will barely make a dent in your wallet. And once you have everything you need and enough money, there's almost nothing to do in the game except grind for stuff you can't mine/build/buy. 
- cannot enjoy past expeditions and rewards given before I started :( 
- you can name everything, from systems to rocks...but they won't really show for you or others in space. The game forgets mapped planets and named systems. 

The game is extensive, but repetitive to braindead levels. The sandbox element is the saving grace. There are some incredible devs that managed to turn around a global scam and a global laughing stock of a game, and some designers/writers that should never touch a game again. The level of wasted potential in this game is staggering. It could have been one of the best games of the decade with all the things you could have done in it, instead, it's just a grindy ""what could have been"" with 0 replay value after a thorough game play. Respect for free dlc's, but the multiplayer aspect killed the main selling point for me. Buy it, but buy it on a sale.",1706725168,1706725168,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Today, it's a mile wide and like, maybe a couple of feet deep.   Enough to soak yourself and float around on your back, pleasant enough.  But no diving, not deep enough to practice your breast stroke or anything.  

By that I mean, there are plenty of systems in place to mess around with.  Lots of 'stuff' to do; you can build a base, explore planets, work towards getting the submarine to explore underwater, do missions, etc.  Most of this stuff involves finding and collecting money, resources, 'nanites' (secondary money), 'Salvaged Data' (third type of money) to spend on upgrades at the Anomaly bazaar.  It's all fun enough and although it's fairly grindy I enjoy it pretty well.

But, I wish there was more to it.  Especially with the great planet generating system the game has, I wish it had a real economy.  Last I checked (which was awhile ago, I could be wrong so I'll leave comments open for corrections) the economy was fake, ie you can sell a whole cache of some widget to a station and the price for it will crash in that system, but it will only stay that way until you warp a few systems away and back and then it will reset.  I wish it was possible to really set something up, like finding a mega-vein of an element and setting up a mining operation, sending the ore to a 
personal factory space station to make widgets, etc.  Maybe find a planet with particularly tasty animals and make a factory farm.  When I bring this up on NMS forums most players seem to think it would detract from what the game's point 'aught' to be, exploration.  Maybe that's correct, I leave it up to you to decide. 

On a side note the game runs great on my Steam Deck.  I avoided installing it there because I figured it would be a slideshow or look terrible, but it mostly runs smoothly and looks pretty good.  Lots of ugly pop-in, but that's true on most desktop PCs with this game too.  And so far I've only noticed a lot of slowdown in the Anomaly hub, where there's lots of other players doting around.  But it doesn't become unplayable and there's no combat or anything in that area anyway.  I haven't played any multiplayer besides the hub so I don't know how well it would run then.

It also plays very well in VR, and looks and runs well on my setup (Valve Index, RTX 3080 12 gig, 32 gigs RAM and Ryzen7 5800x3d)",1706719413,1706719413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I've always enjoyed playing it on a monitor, the transition to VR, specifically using the Varjo Aero headset and Valve Index Controllers, has transformed my gameplay experience profoundly.

In this brief review, I want to focus not on the technical aspects, but on the unique emotional journey VR offers. This became particularly apparent in the shift in my playstyle, which I noticed was not a conscious decision.

Immersed in VR, my exploration of the game's universe has slowed down significantly. I find myself savoring every detail of each new planet I encounter. Currently, I am on a paradise world, which undoubtedly enhances this experience. The slower pace in VR contrasts sharply with my monitor gameplay, where I was more driven by technical progression and the thrill of advancement. In VR, my joy springs from the immersive visuals and the sensation of truly being present in these stunningly crafted environments, surrounded by exotic flora and fauna.

It's this shift from a focus on progression to a deeper appreciation of the virtual world around me that makes 'No Man's Sky' in VR a distinctly different, and profoundly more emotional, experience.",1706627560,1706627560,True,1,0,0.509593665599822998,0,True,False,False

Just something kept nagging at me about playing this game and playing it in perma death mode recently which is what I choose to do. I'm glad I did. I can't even really call it a game because the difficulty is just simple and while I usually gravitate more towards more difficult or sweaty PvP games, but this game is simply put down as pure art for me. 

It's one of the few games I spent time just doing photo mode stuff. It's a game where I actually enjoyed exploring and build (I'm not much of the building type either). I usually don't get too engaged in survival games anymore but something about this game made me want to discover things in this vast and endless universe. 

So if you're in the mood for something where you can do pretty much anything from combat, pirating, farming, discovering/exploring, base building, doing multiplayer missions with strangers or timed expedition events, etc etc then give this game a go. 

The story is also very thought provoking and extremely meta to the game's development if you knew anything about the game when it launched. These guys really stepped it up.

Exploration is fantastic, some of the vehicles are too, base-building, and just pottering about....all good.

Still have never managed to enter a derelict (_all_ of them are broken), can't rescue my colony any more because I can't land on the plant, teleportation/warps fail to complete about one time in three, etc.    There has been one tiny update that didn't even mention, much less fix, any of the major issues.]

Waited over a year after the announcement for this to come out for Mac.   When it does, it's effectively unplayable.   Planets randomly fail to ""resolve,"" remaining fuzzy clumps all the way to the ground and preventing landing.   Derelict freighter doors go into ""additional security required"" scans permanently, preventing you from entering.   Models sometimes take so long to draw (on an M1 Max with 64 GB RAM!) that you can be halfway though a building or hill before it appears.   Ships suddenly deciding entire planet surfaces are ""landing area not clear,"" even when they ARE clear.

I'm hoping they get it under control again; the Mac needs some upscale games, but right now its either wait or go back to playing it on the PC.",1687652445,1706476224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, I didn't play this from day 1, but I started before the Frontiers update. I was so indulged in this game that I forgot my laptop was overheating (over 90 °C). But, I was glad that I played and got this game. After I saw it on steam for sale, I bought it immediately. Before that, I played on Xbox Game Pass PC.

This game definitely has beautiful procedurally generated planets, flora & fauna. You will be anxious about what planets will in my next visiting system. Story wise, game is just great. With Endurance update released a week ago,  I will definitely recommend going for this game. Even the original price is worth it.

But, with all those beautiful graphics, planets, music etc, there is definitely bugs and glitches which can get annoying sometimes. The only glitch I ever faced was when mining for deposits that show there are resources left to mine when scanned through scanner even though I have mined them completely.

Overall, I give 8.5/10 for this game. All for giving the free updates, expeditions and an infinite universe (literally) to explore on our own pace. Thank you, Hello Games. looking forward to 'Polestar' expedition. :)",1658924456,1706475558,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Credit where credit is due for that. I've seen plenty of games become shadows of their former selves, but never have I seen a game come up as much as this one. 

The problem I have, and I don't think I'm alone in this, is that everything still feels obfuscated. There's more to do than ever but figuring out HOW to do something is the problem. I'm the type that doesn't enjoy wandering and discovering slowly, I like being goal oriented and I get bored without both short term and long term objectives and interplay between them. 

No Man's Sky certainly has that, but the layering of each system that exists feels wrong. Every part feels independent of the other. As I said, I like everything they've added and have no complaints with each individual part, it's the whole machine that fits together wonky. 

As such, I'm never confident in what I'm doing or where it's going, I always feel like I need a guide to tell me what the end point of each system is. It just doesn't come together organically into something that feels like a cohesive experience. Each thing you can do stands out from the other things. On paper, that SHOULD be good, it should feel rewarding and interesting and give players that sense of discovery and awe that clearly was part of their design philosophy. But for me, it just doesn't. It doesn't click, there's no aha moment, I never feel like I understand what exactly I'm doing. 

It feels like I'm playing a game inside a game, or in a dream. Like there's another layer, a thin veil over the whole experience that I can never quite punch through. I do enjoy the individual parts for what they are, but the experience as a whole always gives me that sensation. 

I only recommend this game if you're NOT like me. But if any of this resonates with you then you might feel the same way about No Man's Sky that I do, and not enjoy it.

Well, this is a sad truth. Let me start off by saying. No Mans Sky at heart is a simple Survival Exploration game. That is all, do not go looking for much more. Ontop of that, all features in-game are only half baked ideas that arent fully fleshed out. 

If Exploration is your thing and you just want a game that lets you explore to your hearts content then this game is for you, i still dont recommend this at full price. Id say no more than $30 USD. 

The game does have good points. Its fun finding new planets, some are usally similar to others but unique enough to be fun to explore for some time. The views are amazing. The game was made for you to sit back, get a cup of your favorite drink, put on some music, and just cruise. Take this game too seriously and you will hit the wall of disappointment fast. 

The game does not have a story, and for what little story it attempts to have, it is very unsatisfying and a failed attempt at being philosophical. Sean Murray is no Plato, hes not even your community college philosophy teacher good. 

But heres the problem now. What else could i say about this game? Space combat, half baked, mining, half baked, UI, half baked, story, raw.....This is a walking simulator. You'v just been punked, Sean Murray is actually Ashton Kutcher.
Im not saying its a bad game, im just saying its not worthy of its spot, a little mean to say, but it didnt need sony, it didnt need IGN interviews, it needed just its simple design and a greenlight.

All i can leave you with is the suggestion to go watch: WoWCrendor's 2 minute review of No Mans Sky. 
Because in all reality, this game doesnt need more than 2 minutes to review. 

All in all, No Mans Sky is a good Early-Access game for $25 USD.........oh wait its not an E.A $25 game.",1471894855,1706405604,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First hour was the same as hour 2-9-  All you do is collect the resources till you can buy/make enough fuel to warp to the next solar system, and repeat.
Exploring around the planets is fun and all, but around hour 9 I ended up finding enough blueprints that I could craft the fuel to warp using basic materials I could either buy from the galactic trade, which is floating around every solar system- Or if I wanted to be cheap I could simply mine asteroids for a few minutes then craft the fuel.

At that point I saw no reason to ever set foot on a planet, so it just became- Warp to solar system, make fuel, warp to solar system, etc..

That's about the point I went ahead and applied for a refund.

The game is a really nice work of art, its really well coded, it didn't crash once, and for the most part ran at 25-30 FPS, so playable at min settings.. But as a game, doing the same thing over and over, making slight improvements to fairly useless ship/inventory/guns, like, why? 

 There is no carrot here, no reward, just keep going to the middle of the map, and about the whole ""quintillions of planets"", the game has an optimal path for you to follow, and I can't see any reason I'd ever leave the path, and considering I'm only one person, I can't see what real difference it would make if everyone was on the same exact path, with people never meant to be able to ever cross paths, why not just make it purely single player, with everyone doing the exact same path, like in theory we wouldn't even tell the difference unless we watched someone elses gameplay- Without a multiplayer the only point of a different planet layout is replayability, and I can't see any reason I'd ever reset this game after putting in the effort of leveling it up etc, like there is no real different paths, its all about making cash and upgrades.

Maybe in a few years after they add some actual gameplay and not just eye candy it could be awesome, but by then something else pretty would come along, lets be real.

I'd reccomend watching someone stream that already has made it to the middle of the first galaxy AT LEAST, so you have some idea of how repetitive/samey/pointless the gameplay is, and if you really think that's enough to keep your attention, buy it.


Edit: Ok so they added a lot of content.. But I still give it a negative, because I logged into my old 63 hour save and I can turn off damage, free craft anything, etc???? They just ruined my save file.

Games with these journalist options are an instant no from me.
Balance the game and release it, if anything add difficulty options, sure, but these options to switch to creative mid game are UNACCEPTABLE.

and i have just barely scratched the Surface in this Universe. 
But WTF is wrong with Dev's who want to put so much Fog and mist in games these days?
i mean do you morons really think it makes the game more fun to have all thick Fog and mist blurring your Vision?
Reality Check . It does NOT. its just stupid. And i for the life of me can not figure out why they do this. then it occurred to me that they might be being paid to add this feature by hardware companies that sell Video cards and CPU hardware.
Because I know for a fact that im not the only gamer that feels this way about all the damn Fog and mist.
i see tons of threads about tons of games and people asking how to remove this crap .and more often than not . you cant.
the Devs have basically set it as mandatory Fog and mist and you cant turn it off.. WHY? WHY would they do this? unless they are getting paid to do it so that people feel they need to keep upgrading there Video cards and CPU's and memory sticks to handle all the damn Fog. because these Devs know we dont like it. and they also know for a fact that FOG causes FPS, Visuals  and game optimization to all take a serious Hit. So again I ask why do they do it?


So if a Developer of this game reads this.I love this game . great Job.
Please Remove all the fVking Fog or give us the option to do so. i want clear crisp visuals ., not Foggy misty crap so that i can barely see.

They do little seasonal things they call expiditions, which allow you to get limited time items for your account. I wish you could get multiple expidition awards on one character, but you need to start a new character for each one. 

You can roam the universe, charting new solar systems, scanning wildlife on planets, scanning rocks and minerals, build bases, be a wandering merchant, be a pirate, you can participate in faction quests, you can go around learning alien languages, you can start a town, and provide a nice place to live for the aliens of the galaxy. You can buy a capital ship, and hire workers to go and start a trade empire for you, or a research task force, and get nice rewards from them. Find an abandoned ship floating on the edge of a solar system, and get rare rewards from it. Find a temple on a planet and excavate, declare war on a bunch of flying robots, and kill enough that a 5 story high robot spawns in and tries its best to end your existence. Kill it, and steal its brain. Use it to make yourself stronger. My point is, there is so much stuff to do in this game. It's well thought out, well executed, and easily one of the best games released in a very long time. Please spend your money here, the devs deserve it.

Personally, I'd like to see some changes made to this game in the settlement category. The cities you can make focus on producing resources for you (selected at random when the settlement is generated), and I'd like it to have options to grow into a functioning city with a populace instead of just being a little factory.

I want to be able to build housing, and schools, and medical centers, and make a real city. procedural generated, still, but just something more.

I came back to this game over he Holiday break, and found that the tutorial grind is much better that when I reviewed the game in early access. The game is incredibly expansive (which it's known for) but due to the amount of NPC interaction it feels like you're in a typical MMO. Even the ships passively flying overhead while you;re on planet gives it a great touch. They have listened to the community and have made an outstanding game. I'm so glad I came back to this. 





Like many I had very high hopes for this game with its release. I held off on buying it because of the horrible reviews, and got excited when reviews improved with the updates. Well IMHO it's still brutal. Disclaimer, I couldn't stomach getting past the tutorial. Maybe it gets better? I have summed up my game experience below.

Hello, you're stranded in space. Go get this material. Before you can harvest that material you need to repair your harvest tool. In order to do that, please run 800um over there to get that material. OK, repair tool. Now run back and gather that material. Oh, before you can find that material we need to craft a scanner, please run over that way and look for material to gather to build a scanner. OK, before we can build the scanner, please gather material to make a portable refinery. That material is on another planet, which requires we fix your ship, which requires another 45 different types of materials to be gathers. Opps, your gathering tool needs to be recharged, please gather material for that. Oh, your inventory is full? Drop something, and be very careful what it is, because your ship is out of fuel, and you will need to gather material to get to the place where you need to gather material to fix your material gathering tool. 

Nope. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind grinding out in survival games, but this game is over the top in mind numbing, near zero progress, just gather to stay alive style gaming.",1580136281,1705927230,True,0,0,0.487279325723648071,0,True,False,False

This game's developers are amazing, truly have I never seen such determination from game devs. They could have left this game, took the money and run. They didn't. They released tons of free content and continue to expand and improve this game. No Man's Sky might not have the absolute best graphics, or sound, or animations, but remember that not everyone has millions of dollars in budget. What's most important in a game isn't how much money you put into it, it's the heart and soul put into the gameplay. 
    No Man's Sky is an excellent game in that regard. I cannot express how much this game means to me. The sense of excitement and wonder at discovering strange planets and the feeling of seamlessly flying out of a planet's atmosphere for the first time. I still remember that moment. All I could think was, ""wow"". No Man's Sky isn't for everyone though. Please do your research before buying this game because I hate seeing people purchase games and hate them and demand refunds.

I also happened to be craving a specific type of casual exploration game that I just wasn't getting from many other popular games of the genre. I wanted a game where I didn't have to try so hard and I could make my own pace. My steam hours says I'm at about 150 hours but my actual save is only 100 and those hundred hours were mainly acquired in just the past couple of weekends that I had off from the day job. I've had to think on it to put into words why i was so addicted to this game, just know that i've gone in mostly blind; all I've known before hand was its trailers and the reception it had during its original launch....

It would be easier to point out what I didn't like about it first; mainly the writing. The ""story"" of No Man's Sky is, most of the time, pretty serviceable and occasionally thought-provoking; but is also quite amateurish in a few others, in such a way that damage the setting and make it appear shallower than it could have been. To go into detail would be spoilers so, to be short, it seems clear that the devs have a favorite race in the game (the Korvax) and the player character's dialogue is written to be a bit presumptive in certain untasteful ways during certain sections of The Artemis Path questline and a few other spots. 
My other main critic is the UI. There doesn't really seem to be an auto-sort of any kind and in fact, inventory management IS a primary gameplay mechanic. To be honest, having to manually sort and arrange the inventory, one tile at a time, is one of the aspects that kept me most addicted to this game; although that is clearly tedious and will put off some people. Your mileage may vary :^)

There is a lot I could say about what I like about it. To just say that it is ""comfy"" somehow doesn't feel like enough; it is a visually pretty game and, to my surprise, the soundtrack is very heavily Post-Rock, which is a genre I love, and is a big part of NMS having such a strong, and immersive atmosphere. All the content the devs have added over the years has added a significant amount of value to the experience, on top of the addicting gameplay. I loved taming creatures and showing them to other players in the game's online. 

Speaking of the game's online, in my experience, there are somewhat few english speakers but there are a good handful of players who were happy to give some free things. I rarely ever got to play Nexus missions with other players which i was a bit sad about, so I cannot recommend NMS if you are seeking a highly active online experience, much less in a language you can understand. 
This is ironic because learning alien languages is a secondary gameplay mechanic of No Man's Sky.

Put aside all of the hype and misleading statements from the developers and marketers behind No Man's Sky over the last three years and just focus on the actual game, for a moment.

[h1]What No Man's Sky Has Going For It[/h1]
The math. As an exercise in procedural world generation, it is fantastic. A universe of 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets, all procedurally generated by a bunch of math that all fits in a two gigabyte download is rather fantastic.


[h1]What Drag's No Man's Sky Down[/h1]

The user interface is terrible. Every time you change a setting or option, you have to restart the program. Every time you want to select a menu item, you have to hold a button and wait for a progress bar to fill up. That's right, want to click ""confirm""? Simply clicking it isn't enough. Click and hold for a couple seconds, instead. It's clearly an interface designed for the console and a controller that was poorly ported.

After you have visited three planets and a space station, you have essentially seen everything the game has to offer. They are all minor iterations on each other. 

There are only a few types of things to find on each planet, you'll start to see the same plants and animals (but a different color, perhaps) on every planet. 

Every planet will have generally the same resources (at least minimal necessities).

The only gameplay element is really inventory management, which is poor. You can't even see what things you can craft unless you have a free spot to craft it in and you can't rearrange your inventory unless you have at least one free spot to use as a ""middle man"" as you move things about.

The first couple of planets are exciting. Such variety! It's amazing! But by the third, you realize the trick.

And then you start to realize even more of the flaws.

Every planet has the same gravity.

Every planet has plant and animal life on it.

Every planet has minerals on it.

Every planet has some  monoliths and stations on it where you collect essentially the same things.

It isn't even that pretty. It's kind of grimy looking. And even on a powerful system, you get this obnoxious sort of grainy ""pop-in"" as you travel over a planet.

And, ultimately, you shoot for the center of the galaxy . . . which is the end-game. And . . . well, if you really want to find out, just search youtube for the end. It's not worth it.


This game is a brilliant concept and if this were Early Access, it would be worth a lot of hype. Unfortunately, it's a full triple-AAA priced published title. And . . . it's just lacking. Lacking in everything.

The curiosity of this game would be worth $20 USD on sale at some point. As it stands now, it is difficult to recommend this game to anyone at full price. I may return to this game, someday, but only if they release a ton of additional content to it over the coming months.

I like Sean Murray. He seems sincere. I'm sure that he had the best of intentions with this title and there are no doubt stories to be told of how influences from partners drove them to the state the game is in right now . . . but when it comes down to it, this is an issue of ""is what I'm getting worth sixty bucks?"".

I really like how they did the lore in this game, theres 2 main quests that gameplay wise are mostly fetch quests, but are amazing dialogue/writing-wise (same goes for the sidequests) then there's also tons of POI's in the game that give little bite-sized pieces of lore that you can piece together the more you find.

Hello Games is still giving the game a ton of love, adding massive updates every couple of months or so.
In my experience the Expeditions (limited time events for some exclusive rewards) do give a bit of FOMO pressure though.

Cons:
- Combat is infrequent and feels kinda awkward.
- The art style is a little cartoony.
- Base building is rudimentary and awkward. Please expand on this. (If you haven't already).
- What is an atlast pass and how does one acquire it? Lots of chests require them.
- Tutorial crafting of essential resources requires a bit of digging through menus. Either make it intuitive or make it arcane so I have to google and memorize it. Pick a lane.
+/- learning languages feels satisfying, while practicing languages is very tedious (but rewarding!).
- Alien non-sentients feel awkward, but unique.
- Having a unique UI takes some getting used to.

Pros:
+ Procedurally generated universes leave potentially endless content.
+  Biomes vary more than I'd anticipate.
+/- learning languages feels satisfying, while practicing languages is very tedious (but rewarding!).
+ There is a story that you can discover at your own pace. I'm very curious about how this plays out.
+ Discovering stuff is fun and rewarding. You can name your discoveries!
+ Space combat was awkward until I realized there's a hotkey to track enemy movement from your cockpit (It will automatically align your cross-hairs! I'm a terrible pilot!)
+ It seems like there's lots of free DLC, which is a very good selling point. I get the impression they're free seasons. I have fairly limited knowledge of how these work. I guess they're just free updates? Not quite sure ""season"" is the right word.
+ Bugs are minimal if present...

REVIEW AT RELEASE: 

3/10

With a lack of a tutorial, I actually had to Google the storyline of the game to figure out what I should be doing. Twice.
If I didn't have to do that, I actually would have likely given this game a higher rating. But they really just throw you into it, which some people are into, but I am definitely not.

If you like exploring, it's fun. If you like aimless wandering, it's fun.
If you like a structured storyline, it's not amazing.
If you get bored easily, it's definitely not the game for you. 

After playing for around 20-30 hours, I found that it really is just scanning, mining, jumping to a different planet, and managing your inventory.

EDIT: After trying to play more, the CTDs and stuttering are just ridiculous. Textures are terrible. I actually upgraded my graphics card so I could run at high rez textures (GTX 1070) and it still looks like LOD textures from Fallout NV. 

I thought perhaps more gameplay would open up after you jump a few star systems. It does not.",1471380044,1705091240,True,0,0,0.517435312271118164,0,True,False,False

I already liked this game when it came out, as I hadnt really paid attention to the hype around it, so there was no preconceptions that couldve been dissappointed. At the Start, this game straight up enchanted me. 
It wasnt the gameplay loop, that although accessible and intuitive from day one, has remained one of its weaker points, it wasnt its super crisp, bloomy visuals (which I love nontheless), or the amazing and unique soundtrack composed by 65days of Static. No, what enchanted me for the first 40 Hours of playing this game, was its very unique quality, something I havent really been able to experience in any other Space-related game, any other Survival Game, or quite literally any game, for that matter: What enchanted me from the moment I took to Stars was the feeling of somber melancholy, of sad sublime, the absolute and crushing solitude that only Space can give you. As the games environment is procedually generated, a massive Universe spawned from a set of rules and a starting Seed, it really hammers down the metaphor of an uncaring cold and dead universe, not material, but digital in this case, in which desolate loneliness is the emotional Axiom. I havent been able to find this feeling in any other game ive played, ever. And I treasure the memories I made immersing myself in it. Later on, as the game evolved, its character become more lighthearted, warm, and the generation of its environment became more ""realistic"" and earth-like, and lost a bit of its surreality. I enjoyed the improved COOP-Mode, but that magical feeling of crushing insignificance in the face of an uncaring universe never came quite back. 
I wouldve given this game an 8/10, but it has changed. And while I think the countless free updates this game has gotten have objectively made it a better game, more accessible to a larger audience, and with more stuff to do, subjectively for me, it has lost a bit of the unique appeal it had to me. As of know, I still enjoy playing with friends from time to time, but ill never find myself resting at the silver beach of a purple ocean, with golden formations of Stone floating in the Air above, gazing at its surreal landscape elevation, and feeling the loneliness of a lost astronaut in a binary universe of LED-lightened Smoke, and Silicon Mirrors.

If you want space combat, play Freelancer, and if you want resource-gathering and base-building, play Valheim or Subnautico.  I played for 12 hours and kept expecting it to get better, but it just never did.  It's worth mentioning that the UI is horrible.  I thought Borderlands 2 inventory interface was the pinnacle of intern-written UI's designed to make everything more frustrating than they need to be, but NMS takes the cake.

Hmm, probably also worth mentioning that there nominally is a plot, but it seems half-assed.  I mean, I'm mentioning it, but just to notify you that it's not worth mentioning.  Just, ""Go to point X for reasons.  Now go to point Y for reasons.  Now there's a voice in your head that wants you to go to planet Z.  Then it wants you to go to planet W.""  In other words, don't buy this game if you're hoping for a story.

...and just in case that wasn't enough, there are lots of aliens in space stations, but you can't communicate with them.  You can randomly find obelisks that teach you one word from a random language.  You can also ask aliens to teach you a word from their language (then you can no longer interact with them).  After 12 hours of begging every alien in every space station to teach me and hitting every obelisk I could find, I got to the point where I could read less than 1 word per alien dialogue sentence.  Maybe at 100 hours I'd be able to communicate...  but would it be useful?  I'm guessing no.

This game has come a massively long way from what it used to be in all the right ways (exploration, combat, building/crafting, lore, and accessibility). Despite the disastrous launch and merited negative criticisms, the development team and content designers have crafted a sprawling game with a sense of scale, awe, and space sci-fi atmosphere that few other games can replicate. 

The addition of expeditions has been a greatly refreshing and interesting experience for easing the player into the expanding the universe lore and getting them acquainted with in-game mechanics.

This is my ONLY recommended space exploration/crafting game and I can't think of any other game that can compete with this value. Neither Elite Dangerous or EVE online, both of which seem dry, worn out, and overly complex for the average person. 

Lacking is the rough combat that's still rather basic and isn't explored fully by deep combat-oriented achievements or objectives. I would also welcome the addition of player-crafted structures being populated within the planets until it becomes its own sprawling metropolis interconnected with other crafted/generated hubs, something similar to Dwarf Fortress and other crafting/exploration games like it.

Buy NMS, relax, and think about the beauty of the cosmos and creation in the comfort of your home.

275850,116027865,76561198167896565,0,49,5692,88,3742,1708351315,"New review:

Its so much better now. There's now a separate slot for your suit/ship/freighter modules and your storage. There's a lot more storage now as well. The resource grind has also lessened a lot. Some hazard protections can recharge on their own, all modules have more than one refueling method, and the rewards for quests/looting are now much higher. Planets are now more varied and they all have many different points of interests. The team has also promised many more updates this coming year--supposedly the biggest year for No Man's Sky yet.

Some things I would like to see improvement on:

- Colonies/Settlements should have more NPC interactions. As of right now, the roaming NPCs in your settlements don't really do anything. The ""mood"" bar for your settlement is more or less meaningless and they increase/decrease based on your dialogue choices in random events. I would like to see an improvement where mood management is much more fluid--where you can talk to each NPC in your settlement and increase their moods through interaction and resource allocation, and have that reflected on the overall mood meter in the settlement's stats. Hello Games should take notes from other colony sim games. They can make it so an NPC's mood is increased if they have a home allocated to them, if they have good food, or if they have decorations in their home. That would elevate the settlement system immensely.

- They have unfortunately made the aesthetic too cartoonish in my opinion. The game used to look a lot more bland, but that also added to the game's realism. Now, everything in this game is overflowing with vibrancy and saturation. Even the little things like freighter rooms have started to look more cartoonish and less realistic/analog. The expedition command room have gone from an analog-looking computer terminal to a bright hologram-riddled mess.

- The render distance is atrocious. Even on max settings, there is still so much pop-in and low-res textures.

- They need to improve on the space station NPC interactions--which make up like 80% of your NPC interactions. The ones next to the trade terminal all have the same 4 dialogue options; and you can't just click one, you have to hold it down for it to register. They are extremely tedious and repetitive as a result.

- They need better tutorials. Like every minute I have to reference the fan wiki to find out what I'm looking for. 90% of the blueprints are unlockable via the Anomaly. The game does not tell you this. I have played for 30 hours on a new save and just recently found out that the components/modules I was missing were all unlockable via certain NPCs in the Anomaly.

Some other things every new player should know are:
- Freighters are the big ships that you can build in and house all your other ships.
- You can not pilot the freighter.
- You can only own one freighter.
- Frigates are ships that are bigger than your regular ships, but are smaller than your freighters.
- You can not pilot frigates.
- Frigates don't have modules or inventory.
- To get a freighter, you have to save one from a pirate attack in a random space-event. Your first freighter is free, but DO NOT claim it if you don't like it. Because you can only own one freighter, if a better one comes along, you will have to spend millions to exchange your old one for your new one. It is more efficient to just hold off on claiming your first free freighter until you encounter one that's B-class or above.


{Older review:

Really addicting but also extremely stressful. Resources are drained every second and every time you simply want to reposition your starship. I'm over here trying to find specific rocks to use as material to make other things, yet I'm constantly worrying about not having enough sodium or oxygen to refuel my life support or my hazard protection--all whilst stressing over whether or not I have enough inventory space. They really need to work on improving that. You can only store your items in your exosuit or in your starship if you haven't unlocked the storage container blueprint. Super tedious and annoying.}",1653552823,1704956165,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now, if it just had a 6DOF flight model and realistic scale galaxies and star systems, this would be my favorite thing of all time.

All in all, I'd say it's well worth the price. I was a huge skeptic of NMS when it was first announced/released and held off on trying it for years, but I can definitely recommend it now.

The graphics can be a bit intense if you have a potato computer, but otherwise, really cool visuals with all sorts of environments, flora, fauna, minerals, materials, and more! Each system & planet is unique which is really fun to explore, plus the materials you gather are more or less accurate to real life, with raw materials refining into others and crafting useful parts. The quests are pretty engaging once you get into it too, and work with any play style.

BUT what really annoys me is the insane amount of bugs. Refiners eating my resources instead of actually refining them into what I need. Game crashing while loading and freezing my PC. Just loaded the game to find all my ships and weapons are black with green stripes (none of my stuff is actually black with green stripes) and looks horrible. Multiple reloads haven't solved the problem so I have to quit and wait another 10 minutes for the game to even load. Yes, the game takes a good 10 minutes to load on my gaming pc and always has. Every other game loads fine. 

People say the devs work hard on the game but the fact remains that it hasn't EVER delivered what was promised at launch and, at times, barely functions or won't load at all. I had to load the game three times the other day before I could get past the title screen without crashing.

I had to google several of the mission types, because they didn't give very accurate directions in how to complete them. Sometimes these missions would take me into a different galaxy, which can be inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as trying to figure out which galaxy you're supposed to jump to. I kept looking for a golden cone-shaped waypoint like what appears next to the mission you select and it took me a good 20min, and a little googling before I figured out I was supposed to warp to the galaxy with a plant-shaped waypoint/icon. Then I needed to look for the right planet to scan plants on, which was an entirely different issue. 
Main missions were boring to me. I had no real desire to read the dialogue as it was all very confusing and bland. The aliens themselves in this game seem very annoying to interact with as well, since they all react pretty poorly to meeting the character, but their dialogue also says otherwise. They also seem pretty un-phased whenever I, a complete stranger, enters their research facility on a lifeless planet in space. 
The multitude of different stores for different categories of items in the game feels unnecessary and borderline MMO-like. There's a store for your tool, ship, land vehicle, exosuit, and general goods to buy/sell along with a couple vendors that gives missions, and planetary charts in exchange for nav data. It is extremely excessive.
The multiplayer is hit and miss. I bought this game at the same time as a friend of mine. Once we figured out how to connect to each other, the game got a bit more fun for the both of us, but the portals we would to go to each other's bases seemed to only show up for the other in a list of portals to use whenever they felt like it. There was even one point where my friend was being attacked by a lot of pirates in a different galaxy, but whenever I warped to him, there were no pirates. None I could see, at least. They were completely invisible to me, but not him, as he panicked and flew around me. Yes, we were in the same online session. On the planets we would both visit, either of us would experience storms while the other wouldn't. Opposing temp readings as well on the same planet, and ships in the sky only one of us could see. So even though we were connected in the same multiplayer session, it felt like we were in different instances. Very inconsistent gameplay.
Other parts of the game you can unlock like settlements, and freighter expeditions seem very grindy.
If not for my friend still playing, I probably would have put this down a while back. We're still trying to find a place to build an underwater base. But if you've been to 15 planets, you've probably seen them all at that point. They all have the same 3 boxes to loot, the same 5 buildings scattered about, and the same minerals to mine/extract.

Right now, as is, it's a good time sink. Eventually though, without automation, it's not that fun.
I did the whole story and it was alright, but the voicelessness of it made it lack luster. Really just a boring game to end with that only fits with people that like old games. This game needs Voice acting. This game needs automation. These are facts.
I don't watch any content on this game and played it all by myself and it was alright. I'm just not motivated to build any more than I did. I made an entire facility in my new galaxy that grows all my plants. I have hundreds of millions of credits. S ranked ships and for what?  There's nothing to it. No satisfactory goal. 
Sure, what ever you do is by your own hand, but there's no one to show off too. There are no major cities of NPC's to love. Even the few characters in the game aren't even people you get attached to because they aren't voiced. They're faceless NPC's giving text. This game is empty and it's story is empty.

PROS:
+ Tons of exploration. In fact, this game's primary reason for existing is exploration.
+ You can discover new solar systems, planets, moons, animals (both land-based and aquatic), plant-life, and lots of minerals and rocks.
+ Planets and moons can have very different weather systems, including storms and other environmental disasters. 
+ If you're really inventive, you can take the time to name your discoveries instead of using the randomly-generated names that the game creates for you. 
+ You'll meet alien life (the majority of whom will be one of three races: the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen) and learn their language and culture. 
+ Space combat is fast and usually enjoyable.
+ You can build and decorate multiple bases on different worlds. 
+ All sorts of ships, ranging from small, nimble fighters to large, bulky haulers with lots of inventory space are available. 
+ There are numerous exocraft available, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. 
+ You can eventually purchase a freighter, a massive ship that lets you park all of your personal starships, in addition to being a mobile base (that can be built and decorated, just like planetary bases) that can jump to systems far further away than your ship ever could. 
+ You can modify the components of your exosuit, multi-tool (which is essentially you're mining tool and your gun), ship, and freighter.
+ Graphics look decent. Despite numerous updates to the game over the years, the core engine was still released in 2016.
+ Different game modes, including creative and custom, exist for players who want a more relaxed experience or wish to make some aspects easier and other aspects more difficult. 
+ Controls include mouse and keyboard, gamepad (or controller, whichever term you prefer), and flightstick. I have no idea if HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) works in NMS. 
+ You can play NMS as a normal game (using a monitor) or in VR. 
+ Cooperative gameplay is available.
+ Compatible with Windows 10/11 (and technically Windows 7, although Steam no longer supports Win7 and I heard co-op functionality doesn't work on Win7 either), Linux via Proton, and Mac OS. 
+ Steam Cloud (so you don't have to worry about backing up your game).

NEUTRAL:
+/- Your character is an adult human of undetermined sex. In other words, you control a silent protagonist and there's nothing physically obvious to indicate ""this is a male body"" and ""that is a female body."" 
+/- The game's building mechanics are very weird, especially when it comes to properly sealing bases on planets with inhospitable weather. Properly placing items within a base is a major chore as some snap into place, but most just have to be ""eyeballed"" and as anyone who's ever hung up a painting or rearranged furniture can tell you, this can quickly become very annoying. 
+/- No survival game mechanics. While I'm glad we don't have to manage food, water, and sleep, some gamers love it, so I figured I'd add this bit of info here for the survival game fans out there. 

CONS:
- While procedural generation means you'll find a ton of different lifeforms and biomes to explore, it also means that many of these same combinations are haphazard and make very little sense. In particular, the animals have some of the weirdest combinations I've ever seen. 
- You can't change anything about your ship's appearance. No matter how screwed up the ship looks (and many of them look unbelievably bizarre), that's how it'll always be and you can't do anything about it. You can't even change your ship's color, which is odd because you can change your freighter's colors. 
- In combat, if you even accidentally graze a ship when fighting off pirates, you'll now be treated as a pirate yourself and attacked by that ship and other ships near it. Fortunately, you can reset this by landing on a freighter or on a station, but even so you shouldn't become ""public enemy #1"" if you accidentally hit someone once. 
- The controls are extremely clunky. There are often numerous steps to do things (such as calling your freighter or scrambling a pirate scan of your cargo) and even then, there's very little consistency as sometimes some buttons will do ""this"" but won't do ""that"" yet at certain times they will. This is especially noticeable when some buttons do double or triple-duty. A good example would be the times I've hit ""X"" on my controller to lock on to an enemy fighter only for the game to tell me ""you can't land here.""
- Messages relating to everything constantly appear in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. Not only is that annoying, but it also covers up important screen information in starships.
- Milestone messages appear so frequently that it comes a detriment. When a milestone message pops up, it narrows the screen and then slowly tells you you've taken thirty steps or some other nonsense. You can fast forward through this by pressing TAB on the keyboard, but it's still frustrating to see it pop up when you're doing stuff. 
- Cooperative gameplay in NMS barely works. You can join someone else's game just fine, but that's about it. Want to complete missions together? Too bad. The best case scenario is only one of you gets credit, but more often than not, missions won't function properly or at all. You'll often see different things as well. One of you might see a pirate capital ship attacking while the other won't see anything or one of you will be building a base that looks complete, but the other person will see gaps (that they can fly or fall through) in the floor and walls. Also, good luck finding each other if you start in different star systems. Sure, the galaxy map will show your co-op partner's icon, but because the map is three-dimensional and absolutely massive with no way to orient yourself, you're unlikely to see the other person's icon at all. 
- There's a huge amount of important gameplay information that's not explained in-game and instead relies either on trial-and-error or necessitates asking people on a forum or using a wiki. Games should be self-contained, in that all the relevant information should be accessible to players from the game itself. 
- The game ultimately becomes busywork, with the vast majority of missions repeating themselves or most of your time being taken up by scanning plants and rocks. I realize this is a common drawback to sandbox games, but even so, there's very little to do that you haven't done a million times before and you don't even have interesting NPCs to keep the game going. 

VERDICT: So is No Man's Sky a fun game to play? Yes, but with quite a few caveats. If Steam used a one-to-five star rating system, I'd give it three stars because NMS is a good game overall, but there are lots of problems that negatively impact the experience. 

I'd only recommend NMS if you primarily enjoy single-player sandbox games centered around exploration. If you really want a good co-op game or prefer an RPG or a space combat action game, I'd suggest passing on NMS entirely.",1704597356,1704603092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I finally caved during this past Winter Sale and bought NMS for myself and the homies as a game for all of us to play. I heard it was god awful for so long but then people started saying good things and I'd debated trying it for years. Now, here we are. I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to like it. 

Here's the problem, the teensy wittle tiny problem: its still not fucking multiplayer. After like 12 major updates, each adding new systems and features, this games tutorial is as long as Persona 5's. And if you're playing w friends, you each must complete every step, alone. Half of it is base building and, even if you are all grouped and whatnot, you each have to build a base, you cant collectively build a commune. This means you each have to gather the enormous amount of materials needed to construct everything, and this, coupled with the fact that bases cannot be built in each others territory, essentially means the game forces you apart. Gather materials together? It'll take way longer because you all need the same things and because your bases have to be pretty far apart some of you got a commute to get back. Go adventuring together? Well only one of you gets credit for the kills, the resources for scanning new discoveries, the valuable rare resources you stumble upon. Yes, now you can see other players, go to their bases, etc, but it's still not multiplayer.

Once you have unlocked every system in the game, NMS feels like a mobile game. Log into the game to tend to your settlement on its hour timer, send your fleet on missions on its 4 hour timer, harvest your crops on an 8 hour timer, do fetch and kill quests to raise reputation with a few factions, and gatcha roll warping to new systems and exploring to see if you can find any rare ships or multitools, not with real money, but with resources you constantly have to collect.

The promise of seeing new things every time you venture off the planet or rocketing away from whatever space station you start from was a compelling idea. You ostensibly can create for yourself real estate portfolios busting at the seams with any mood or notion you woke up with and build an empire of custom property and fleets of warrior/diplomatic/entrepreneurial spacefarers. You can have access to the cultural richness of a wide array of alien races; each species with their own values and each individual with their own personalities and motivations. You can fight, you can embrace, you can betray, you can get them ducats, you can meditate on the meaning of existence while pointing your ship in a direction and punching the throttle. A universe of possibilities.

It is not a common state for me to believe the marketing claims of any product, especially computer software, especially especially video games developed over the last decade, but I played until I couldn't stand it an longer. Over 100 hours and not accomplishing much at all. Bare in mind, it was not the length of time and minimal progress that made me sour so much towards NMS, I play games fully and over long periods of time regularly. It was actually two things that broke me. 

One, of all the time I spent in that universe, nothing surprised me or gave me any sense of awe after the planet I first spawned on after starting a new game. Even that got old at an uncomfortably swift clip. The core game mechanics seem to revolve around activities: finding new life on planets, completing missions, completing tasks (in my mind these are the missions that are completions of essentially chores), and piloting your ship from planet to planet to fulfill the latter 3 things. each of these things are highly repetitive; quickly, and in the slowest possible ways, becoming a tedious slog. Moreover, you need money and nanites (no real difference except they are used to exchange for different things in an awkwardly arbitrary way) for acquisition of items and resources, all of which are randomized in their respective locations...every time you want them and even if it's the same location. It's been expressed many times before, but the problem lies in relying so heavily on procedural generation. Not just for the planetary features or the organisms that live on them, but also for all of the NPC interactions, side missions, and inorganic items you come across or produce. It forces the game to come across heartless and brain dead, ending up with no purpose or intent for the amnesiac (truly original) you control to do literally anything in the worlds of NMS.

Two, and the most obvious, is the S-tier (a purposeful pun) levels of jank in the game. I refuse to outline the specific bugs from the tome of examples I've created because after describing what I was dealing with to a coworker a couple days ago, having to live through those bugs again, I was left with a severe headache afterward. However, the last time I loaded the game, the ship I was piloting, just before I hopped out to save and then exit the game, was missing its entire cargo. It wasn't even the valuable, high-unit items I cared about. It was the time and effort I put into amassing the things that would keep me from having to return to port so often. Items whose purpose was to relieve the tedium to the point of being bearable, and that took me days to accumulate, were taken from me, leaving me knowing that I would have to do it all over again to return to a flow where inventory management wasn't my lord and master. A brutal flashback of my first problem overwhelmed me. It was quitting time for good. I had heard the bugs in this game used to be worse and the thought of that makes me want to alleviate my headache with a power drill.

This game's only purpose seems to be keeping you playing it. Not with an intriguing story or novel gameplay, but through the same compulsive obligation we feel from unfulfilling jobs; made worse, and even longer, by the excess of immersion-breaking bugs. Also, I believe ""sandbox"" , since the developers don't make the game, the players do, should come with features, hopefully more than one or two, that are unique. NMS fails at that, too. It is an experience whose only inspiring takeaway, at least for me, comes from the beautifully composed screenshots you can take with the in-game tool, and since the depth of the game is what has just been laid out, if you have seen any of the screenshots, you've played the game.

Question
--------------------
Since this is a technologically advanced reality, where the hell are the maps? The planets you haven't visited or scanned are called ""unmapped planets"", so maps exist, but they don't use them? (I know about the galactic map, but again, you can barely tell what's going on there and you still can't go to specific planets on it which wastes even more time...long press...)

You can figure out, in this universe, how to beam inventory 200 meters to and from your starship hold, but you can't figure out how to access your vault without physically opening it? A game that 80% of is inventory management and no sorting of inventory? records of inventory were some of the main reasons writing on Earth was invented at all, and in the game's universe, that's beyond their ability?

The only caveat is that I had a special ship (which was only a B-tier, so it wasn't even that good) that required specific materials that I didn't have and would have taken hours to find, and a significant amount of RNG to boot. This truly put into perspective for me how much of this game is actually just mindless grinding for menial loot. I think over the past few days I have spent hours simply sitting at trading posts and space stations waiting for a good ship to come through but nothing has happened. That was particularly egregious to me, so I took a break then went back to the ""normal game play"", however, this normal game play was actually just more grinding, more fetch quests, and more RNG. On top of the more central grindy aspects of the game, simply existing in the game is a grind, you have to replenish your core life support, as well as many different specific environmental options based on the different planets. Then on your ship you have a limited amount of launches to use, as well as replenishing the fuel in your hyperdrive and your pulse engine, but this is one of the more of the reasonable ones.
On top of the incredibly mind-numbing grind of this game, the quality of life is simply nonexistent. The usage of the inventory screens can be acquired but is still slow and at first feels very unnatural. The movement feels deathly slow without the ability to melee jetpack which is possibly an exploit, yet is the only thing that makes moving on foot bearable.

Its story is rather short but also drawn out in the same time, and the related quests are very repetitive to get there. However, once you finish the main story, you just get to enter the free roam again and do as you wish.

Because of this VERY slow burn, this game is not for everyone. And it is also not for me as well. I liked the exploration, I like the settlement building and managing, new planet and biome exploring and more, but there is no reason for me to stick to this game for longer, which is something I realized very late on. I wasted a lot of time mining materials and money, just to not have anywhere to dump it on unless I wish to make everything extremely rare (S class everything grind), which again, was not in the picture for me, because I didn`t care if I had everything maxed out, I enjoyed where things were. 

I don`t have much else to say about the game. Exploration is interesting enough, and it keeps you engaged for a nice 30-ish hours while you explore new stuff, after which is it just becomes a grind fest. 

There are a few things I really did not like about the game:

 1. There is almost no danger in the game. Very few dangerous plants and animals that are way too easy to spot and kill, a few rebel enemies and only one faction that truly *rules* over the whole universe. All of them, even the most dangerous enemies are not that hard to kill, or to evade.
2. A lot of stuttering problems. While it never crashed, it stuttered A LOT of time during the loading period of large areas, and this stuttering continued on for quite a while afterwards, making it almost permanent. 
3. Variety. No matter how randomized things are, you will start seeing patterns very fast. Most of things look different, while having the exact same role as the other 99 similar objects (being plants, ships, tools or other).

But it was to be expected, many reviews here informed me about it. But those reviews also convinced me it was the right time to buy this game. Even if VR wasn’t perfect, I fell in love with this game in VR. After a few hours, I had to switch to a flat screen because I couldn’t play as fast as I wanted.

Regarding the game itself, it simply has so much for everyone. You have space ships, space fights, you have a playable character (not just a spaceship), your character can fight, you have vehicles, you can  build bases, you have progressions (suits, weapons, ships, vehicles, etc.), you have customization, you have so much more… Yes, there’s a lot of grinding but in this game it feels relaxing to me. The planets are so beautiful! I can jump in, do 1 or 2 missions, mine a little here and there, warp to another system, discover new planets, etc. In one word, amazing!

Now for the DEVs. You have done a wonderful job. I love it and I’m obviously not the only one! But please don’t stop there. This game could be a reference in VR if you want it to be. With the visuals you have, you could easily achieve that. On a flat screen, I can play the game in ULTRA everything. In VR it’s playable with everything set to minimum and with GPU settings carefully chosen. Almost everything was blurry, the quest panel doesn’t move when you turn your head so it ends up in your back most of the time. Looting is challenging to say the least, you move closer, you go left, you go right, you go back. In my case it was to a point where I simply left loot behind… If things improve in VR I’ll be the first to try it again even after 100s of hours played (one day or the other...).",1704417263,1704417263,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also has a general vibe of existential loneliness to be ready for...which is part of the core story, so I'm not just making that up! 

What the game gets right is progression and rewards. You will slowly gain more powerful ships, suit tech, multitools, exocraft of various types...all of these help you explore more of the universe. You can even gain your own fleet of capital ships to send out on resource gathering missions.  Quests (including handcrafted ones) make good use of the procedurally generated worldscape, which is a stark contrast from a certain other game that just came out. 

Overall, I'd say to expect 50-80 hours of enjoyment here.  It's true that some have played for thousands in a similar fashion to Minecraft. But just like that game, you're eventually going to see and do just about everything you can.",1704411985,1704411985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Want to build up bases? Sure.
Want to become an outlaw space pirate? No problem.
Want to just explore the vastness of outer space? Lets do it.
Want to go underwater exploring? Yep can do that to.

Yes there are bugs, but frankly not as many as the big AAA games I have played.  And for those of us who like to see what is over the next hill, or next galaxy it scratches that itch nicely.  It is a casual game, multiplayer kind of patched in but certainly not perfectly - but it's Gud Enuf to check off that box.  
My only real complaints are the startup for first time players.  The OMG where am I and wtf do I do before I die yet again.  Enjoy that adrenaline push, it wont happen ever again.  And building is a bit fidgety and limited, especially for us on the pc.  All the cool things we can't do that those with a controller can is annoying.  And the setup of the build menu is really hard to get used to and inconsistent in its presentation.  But those are small complaints, unless I am in the middle of a build........
On the whole, am glad I got it, feel the goodening of Sean Murray & HG was accomplished and it is a game now worth buying, especially if you can get it on sale.

Update after many more hours.  Still enjoy this game a lot.  Been thru 3 expeditions and they do get me out of my comfort zone.  there are bugs and glitches but for some reason they mostly don't effect me too much.

While this game may not be the best, it also is not the worst. It gives off a similar vibe to playing an adult version of Minecraft. The idea of time travel and the specific upgrades needed to travel in different light years resonates with those of us who enjoy the reality of the Galactic Universe, akin to the Interstellar levels.

Getting this game at 50% off is a great deal, especially considering that the developers have not charged anything for the numerous updates over the last 7 years. The game is not difficult to understand, especially for those who are dedicated to understanding how survival, real life physics, and mechanics are applied within the game, making it easy to pick up and play.

It is also very friendly to mods and can be customized to how realistic you want the game to feel. Apparently so real that you could even play it in VR... ( I still have yet to try with my oculus but I'm looking forward to it)

- The basic gameplay cycle is not fun, as it's just an endless cycle of holding down mouse1 on rocks and plants. 
- The ""main"" story is not fun as it's a bunch of fetch-quests with a lot of pretentious text. No, I don't have hidden masochistic tendencies and would prefer not to have to click on ""submit"" or ""cry out"" thank you, maybe some of the people who wrote this garbage should consider visiting a psychologist instead. 
- The combat is not fun as the enemies doesn't even have basic collision detection and will freely clip through objects or spawn behind/below indestructible terrain and make the engagement impossible to finish.
- The exploration is not fun because either you are on ground and cannot see very far or you are in your spaceship and the game instantly toggles LoD mode and de-renders anything further than 50m away from you meaning that either you are hoovering over the ground or cannot see anything at all. The unique planet is maintains a ""cool"" factor for an entirety of 15 seconds until you realize there's nothing significant mechanics wise there and you can't enjoy the visuals due to above issues.
- The UI is extremely bad and I feel like the people who designed the UI did not play the game at all. Many of the keys cannot be re-bound at all. The default hotkey for changing tabs on freighter inventory is E and one of the default keys to interact with an inventory item is also E, so half of the time you want interact with an object you end up switching inventory tab instead. Navigating is entirely manual as the game lacks basic QoL things like having more than 1 custom marker/highlighted landmark. You can not set waypoints on planets to go to so you end up wasting time spinning around in space to find the planet you want to go to. You cannot set any sort of proper filtering for systems. There's no sort or move multiple function on inventory. If you run into a sudden encounter that requires one item and you have the materials to make the item but not the item itself the quest just fails. Because your choices are Give item (you can't) and Decline (fails quest)
- The base building is a downer as there's very few objects with mechanical significance and rest is static decorations. The part snapping is unwieldy as there's a minimum range of snapping meaning you have to step away to snap something to a nearby wall or platform.
- The game does not respect your time, as ships, tools and upgrades are all RNG generated stat wise to artificially pad the time a player has to spend. This is some shit mechanic you have on Pay2Win MMOs where you can swipe for better chances, except there's no Pay2Win here, you just lose (your time spent) by default. There is no option to auto disable the ""now entering XXX"" or ""reached XXX milestone"" that locks any interactions while its useless waste of time animation is playing meaning you need to manually cancel it each time (which isn't instant either)  

- The game is unpolished and full of bugs. Are you fighting sentinel ships in planetary zone? Can't finish encounter because the Carrier is now invisible. Driving your vehicle on bumpy terrain? You just insta-died for no reason. Trying to dock to a station or freighter? Your ship is trapped the building geometry, repeatedly takes damage for bumping into it and then you die. Trying to generate items with base placeables? It's inventory just reset and your stuff is lost. Shooting things on land? Your tool just suddenly stops shooting or pressing reload does nothing or the tool just lowers itself down for no reason. Destroyed the enemy dreadnought ship? Encounter starts again and continues forever as 2 enemy ships keeps respawning endlessly. Trying to scan all fauna on a planet? Too bad there's 2 (two) different underground creatures and somehow underground creatures are only coded to spawn caves that happens to be near PoIs except only one of them spawns and you can never get the second one. The first person view of ship and land is makes me feel claustrophobic but the 3rd person isn't even properly aligned with the camera meaning you're often unable to highlight/scan what you are looking at without switching back to first person.

It's like you're leaving a mark in the universe that maybe someone will find someday and see you where there.

The game also has very fascinating lore if you pay attention to it, I'm not going to talk about it at all though it's best discovered on your own. Music is great to.

For most people this isn't an issue, but for a significant subset of gamers, mainly those who have been playing 3D games since the 90s, this limitation of the camera controls renders the game unplayable.  It's very hard to re-train your brain on something you've done for decades.  Most developers understand this, and allow inversion of both the x and y camera axis, or they at least allow this to be achieved using Steam to alter the controls (this game inexplicably overrides the Steam controller settings, the only game I've seen do this).  If you google this issue, you see numerous discussions begging Hello Games to make this simple addition, but after several years it's clear that they are content to ignore this subset of gamers.  Attempts to email the company for an explanation have been ignored.

Positives: 
-Great Graphics that do take a while to load in but once loaded in can be breathtaking at times. I would recommend for new comers to try and find these worlds to then share them to others in the form of coordinates
-Amazing story that had me locked in and on the edge of my seat at times. I got to love and know many of the characters which made me come to love the lore just as much
-The amount of things to do in this game will keep you playing this game for hours and hours. There are so many maps and story lines to keep the average player entertained for at least 50 hours before they begin to get bored in the time period that you grind No Man's Sky.
Of course with the positives come the drawbacks of this game however some are to be expected:
-The Repetition is the only main drawback. When many first come to look at this game, many critics online mention the amount of repetition in maps, layouts, and planets. I am here to say that the Critics are only partially true. Fauna and Flora do repeat often depending on the planet type but not entirely, so a couple plants may pop up more then once but other different types you've never seen before are there as well. Also even 100 hours into the game, you will have those breathtaking moments with ""Redacted"" Planets and Paradise Planets. Other than that, ship types as well as buildings, derelict freighters, frigates, etc will repeat as well but maybe that's because the building style is so good? idk
Conclusion: 
No Man's Sky is worth the buy and the 50 initial hours you will put into this game. As long as you can handle the repetition will this game fully thrive and show you some amazing moments. Only feedback I have to the developers is to make the ships more complex, not to the point where we have to play mechanic for an hour, but so that each ship while looking similar might have different engine components or singular pipes that we can customize to maximize stats. Overall, please buy this game and get an idea of its wonder for yourself",1704314395,1704314395,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It can absolutely be regarded as the biggest comeback in gaming history and hello games should be truly proud of what they've accomplished. Over time no man's sky has evolved into my all-time favourite game. I've recently moved over to steam deck with it and it runs perfectly. I've invested probably thousands of hours into this game over the years and it still never ceases to surprise me.

However it does have some very small issues. The combat and especially the PvP can leave you wanting more. A PvP/combat update is sorely needed. It can be a little janky in 3rd person. And there's a graphical bug where the right wing of the hauler class starships are always black unless you get within like 1 metre of it then it renders in. But if the wing leaves your FOV at any time it goes back to black. I've experienced this for years on the PS and still experience it on the steam deck and I have no idea why it's not been patched coz I've seen it in the game for years and it's the only reason I don't use haulers which is a shame because they're my favourite ship. 

Despite all that all it's flaws are completely overshadowed by what an absolute work of impeccable art this game is. It will lead you on an endless journey through an endless universe with endless things to discover, mysteries to solve, bases to build and relationships to forge. This is a game game you can truly get lost in as a wanderer of the stars. I don't want a no man's sky 2, I don't need a no man's sky 2. I just want them to continue updating this absolute masterpiece of gaming.

Looking forward to Hello Games next project, definitely going to check out Light No Fire when that's released. Overall rating, 9/10",1704250017,1704251899,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I would suggestion a few things though ,they need to add a more danger aspect, in the world, Trapped caves from ancient species, perhaps rogue bandit npcs that will try killing you. As Theres really no Threat in the game yet besides weather & Sentinels.

[h1] Review [/h1]

kinda hate how games turn out these days, especially this one, but nonetheless, its a good game.


[h2] Expectations VS Reality [/h2]

the reason i first bought this game was because of the way it gave you the option to exlpore a whole galaxy, read about interesting fauna and flora, build habitats wherever, and progress your tech and become the ultimate astonaut. 
and while thats entirely possible, its not what the game strives to be nowadays. its beginning to turn more into a: get big ships with good stats, make a money farm and become a rich guy flying around focusing on becoming the most overpowered guy around. 
that being said, i have to mention:

[h2] Incredible Support [/h2]

as everyone and their grandma knows, this game has had, probably, the biggest comeback in gaming history, with updates coming out every year since the release, still at the time of writing this review, 7 years later. the thing i find incredible is how its all made by a small team, under 50 people! 
every update this game gets makes it a more enjoyable experience, and at this point, im sat thinking how they continue to make these updates of great quality, but apparently, its one of steams top sellers, which i find jaw dropping.

[h2] Core [/h2]

at launch, reviewers described the gameplay loop as something like this: hold down your mouse button to pick up rescources, deal with a full inventory, get an upgrade, leave the planet, go to another planet, repeat.
and now it looks more like this: hold down your mouse button to pick up rescources, leave the planet, take part in a space battle, get a giant ship, go to another system, encounter a broken big ship with lore and interesting loot, land on a planet, encounter one of many different POI's, get an awesome new ship, get some random new item you didnt know existed, get attacked by pirates from space, kill those pirates until a big ass capital ship spawns and shoots everything thats ever been at you, panic, escape, and so on. and its barely ever repeated, because of the amount of different stuff there is.
that being said, holding down your mouse button is as boring as ever.

[h2] Settling Down [/h2]

one of the main reasons i bought this game was the idea of settling down on a planet and buidling whatever you wanted. and im glad to say that this game does that incredibly well, and i can say that atleast 50% of my time is spent browsing the immensely well varied oppurtunities it gives you when doing so. you can do so much, create so many feelings, you can even place 20 floors the same place as a design choice. i could go on and on about how much i love this system, but id want anyone to experience that for themselves. 

[h2] Variation [/h2] 

another thing that done well here is the variation. for example with vehicles, which there are six of, which all feel different, like the mech that makes you feel safe and strong, or the fast and agile nomad, or the underwater nautilon, which all have great designs aswell. this is just one example, as there are many different suit upgrades as well, which can work as builds themselves, or the many ways to upgrade and customize your ship, freighter, exocrafts, bases, and you can even tame every single animal you see to ride on, from a wolf, to a dragon-like bird, or a long necked dinosaur, which all are gene-customizable aswell, allowing you to fine tune them however you want. all these variations are exceptionally well done, and are worth experimenting with, to truly make this world - or galaxies - your own. 

11/10 would hold down mouse button again

Carl Sagan once said, ""Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still."" Exploration, wanderlust, and discovery are at the heart of No Man's Sky. I can't speak for what this game was at launch - but now, as we enter 2024, this game stands as a love letter to the explorer within each of us.

[h2]Out Among The Cosmos[/h2]
No Man's Sky has a plot, but it is as nebulous as the incomprehensible gas clouds photographed through the Hubble.

Instead, this is a game for explorers. It's for the player who love games like Minecraft because they are eager to discover the next beautiful vista. 

Hello Games, the developer of No Man's Sky, claims there are over 18 quintillion planets available for players to explore. That is 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 - an unfathomly large number, and one that, as it has been claimed, would take literally billions of real life years for a single person to fully explore.

Of course, these planets are procedurally generated, so to call them ""unique"" is a little bit of a stretch. However, at over 50 hours into the game, I'm [i]still[/i] discovering truly new types of planets, and the vast majority have been undiscovered by other players. So, while No Man's Sky suffers the formulaic sameness that other procedural games do, it still feels like a vast, entirely unexplored universe.
 
[h2]Ready At Last To Set Sail For The Stars[/h2]
No Man's Sky offers a wealth of content, and provides players eager to explore a massive universe a seemingly infinite playground for discovery. If you want an in-depth space sim or combat-heavy looter shooter, you'll find this game lacking. But, if you want to find yourself warping from star system to star system, discovering new planets, establishing bases, and seeing what the universe has to offer, then there are truly no games that compare in scope to No Man's Sky.",1704170426,1704170686,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

The flying is absolutely horrible, the base building is horrible, and the overall learning curve for the game is too much given that the tutorial portion was not helpful at all. The multiplayer is just playing along side friends doing your own thing, so its a far stretch to say this game is multiplayer. You can play solo and it won't have any impact on your multiplayer game play and I am truly disappointed with this purchase. Even at 50% off, I still do not recommend buying this game.

Overall, the game is beautiful and the planets are full with vibrance and wonder, but at the end of the day...the game play is what matters most and this game is just terrible for players. I plan to ask for a refund and I hope that I did not play too long because I really tried to give this game a chance, but I really did not like it. I would rather play Space Engineers because it does everything No Man's Sky is trying to do much better.

The Good:
The game play of No Man's Sky is built around exploration. There is a LOT of things to explore and creatures to discover. Almost 100 hrs in and there's still aspects of the game I am yet to explore.
The survival aspect as well as some of the random encounters had me on the edge of my seat at times.
The lore is pretty interesting if you have the patience to piece everything together.
I like the space battles.

The Bad:
There are multiple intelligent alien species but the interiors of their space stations all look the same.

The Ugly:
A lot of these issues will probably be fixed with time, I'll do my best to update it accordingly.
The space battles, while fun, get kind of janky at times. Plenty of times I've taken on sentinel/pirate capital ships and the battle was cut short because I somehow clipped into the ship and got stuck inside. 
The building system, while limitless in its potential, has frustrated me beyond any of the other mechanics. The base-building UI is horrible and the cost of building materials is disproportionate.

After nine years the game is still somewhat buggy and really geared towards single-player play.  Co-op is possible but it's really a sort of pick-up co-op without the option to share a lot of resources.

Navigation is also incredibly painful with poor wayfinding and waypointing.

That said, playing this on modern hardware is rewarding both for the entirely acceptable visuals and the scope the RNG has to get you some really great worlds and visual.

I say, ""give it a chance"" because I personally found it a bit rough around the edges as a new player at the end of 2023. The interfaces and systems weren't very intuitive (especially the galaxy map) and I was feeling a bit lost and/or confused pretty frequently in my initial hours. However, now that I am used to it all I feel a bit silly as it all seems to make plenty of sense now. Beyond that, the game also is still pretty buggy (especially in multiplayer mode) and I find myself wishing there was a lot more variety in assets/points of interest. For example, almost all the space stations look identical inside. 

At this point, my review is already starting to feel like nothing but negatives so you may be wondering why I am recommending it? Well, it's been one of the strangest experiences I've had with a game... In that, I feel like I shouldn't like it as much as I do... because there are a million obvious things about this game that I can criticize... yet despite it all, this game is a blast to play for many of the same reasons Minecraft is. As a new player there is that sense of wonder. What is out in the cosmos? What sort of cool planets might I find? What  treasures await to be discovered? There is also the base building aspects for which they have tons of assets to unlock and play around with. There is also a great sense of progression with all the tech that can be attained. And to highlight one last there, the main story line went surprisingly deep and left me in many moments of deep meta physical contemplation. 

In conclusion, my opinion is that this game shares many characteristics to Minecraft and in many ways it is even better. I feel it has a better sense of progression and a fairly juicy main storyline. The tech available in the game feels a lot like a Minecraft tech mod. And at the end of it all.... just like in MC, you'll have to find your own reasons to keep playing because it's ultimately just a big sandbox and there is no ""end"" or ""purpose"" to any of it beyond just doing whatever you feel like doing.",1704148031,1704148031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's been amazing to see it's development blossom into the game it was originally intended to be. All DLC and overhauls have been free, there are no micro-transactions and most likely never will be, the developer hasn't sold out to a parent company, and they are still updating the game frequently. Of course, these ideals SHOULD be standard among devs, but even these were standard this game STILL would stand out. It's not a case of have a low bar set and being amazed by devs that actually care.

There are many things I still do not like about this game (the lack of NPC interactions/conflicts, lack of enemy AI, wonky first person weapon animations, meh story, etc). The resource grinding/crafting is particularly tedious IMO, though it's gotten better. It is my hope that, with time, the game will improve upon these issues. Perhaps a NMS 2 could be on the horizon, as I do believe the developers have done more than what was necessary to bring their original vision from years ago to life.

To me, what stands out in this game is the seamless exploration. The ability to feel like you are covering vast distances in solar systems within seconds/minutes is amazing. To point at a spot on a planet, and land there manually, is something of a rarity among space exploration games at the moment (*cough* Starfield *cough*). The hiccup here comes back to resource grinding. Travelling between stars can be tedious, but again these are issues that may vanish in the future easily.

This game has exceeded it's original vision, but it's still a 2016 game. It is my hope that a completely revamped NMS entry will come in the future, Until then, I have a blast playing every now and then. After playing Starfield, I gained an even GREATER appreciation for the space travel in this game. It's not perfect, and something HAS to be done about spaceship dogfights in general for game like this, but even in 2016 it was a hell of a lot better that Starfield, a AAA title that spent YEARS in development.",1704130655,1704130655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a main story but it's written as if the writer was trying to strike a mystical, mysterious tone a la Homeworld but just comes off as obtuse, as characters needlessly speak in these odd half-sentences.

Compare this with something like Subnautica, which gives you vital reasons to engage with its systems. You build a base to get the battery charger to power your devices, to build the Seamoth to let you explore deeper and farther in the pursuit of escape from the planet. In No Man's Sky, you have nothing but a vague mystery to propel you forwards while your base building doesn't really feed into your goals.

The game also commits a cardinal sin - stingy inventory slots. There is no reason for this. None. Inventory management is not a fun part of any game. No one fires up Steam for the joy of sorting their inventory or curtailing their exploration because they're out of inventory slots. But No Man's Sky makes you do this chronically and further pushes you to burn game time pursuing inventory upgrades. I don't feel like a space explorer when I'm running around in pursuit of one more inventory slot.",1704066009,1704066009,False,5,0,0.492553442716598511,0,True,False,False

And I love most of the mechanics of NMS but ONE, EXOCRAFT TO SENTINEL COMBAT. I enjoy the effort of making the sentinels shoot at you in your exocraft and damage you, but I really wish there were way more exocraft weapons, and more exocraft. An idea I have on an exocraft would be the Skystalker Gunship Helicopter. I wish this were in the game due to the fact that if your in a spaceship to shoot down on Sentinels, the Sentinels don't shoot back and it just spawns interceptors, plus your ship automatically moves forward unless its interceptor which makes hover firing annoying. As for the weapons I really don't care as long as there are more of them that are not straight from the spaceships. I also wish there was a tank because I understand its an exploration game but using the Roamer for Sentinel combat is just not the same experience. As well, I like the stage five Sentinel Battleship you fight if you do it in a spaceship and I wish there was a land version of bossfight or something because the big walker things are a bit underwhelming.

If you're prepared to play their new (pointless) ""creative mode"" - then sure, go for it (surely they can't screw that over in the future?). But if you want the ""story mode"" then forget it - because after countless hours of gameplay (like me 208 hours) - you'll find this developer Hello Games will, with future updates, screw-over everything you worked towards - all your efforts will be wasted efforts on the next update which will destroy everything you've achieved. Apparently this appears to be a pattern with this developer.

After reading about the horrendous history of this game and the amazing recoveries, I can't believe the devs Hello Games would even consider doing what they have done to their current player-base with the update 4.0. I guess the profits are so great now they just don't care. I guess beyond the price of online worlds, the dev's still control the interfaces to their worlds - to the customers detriment. 

If you're prepared to play a ""galaxy"" game seriously for hours upon hours or months (or years), and then be gutted by some random update that destroys everything you've worked towards - then this is the game is for you!

Otherwise steer clear of this - unless you want a casual ""creative mode"" experience (& we can only hope Hello Games won't destroy that save in the future as well - but who can say - who can trust?)

I just got bored with the ""creative mode"" what a waste of a game. I'm utterly gutted by this update 4.

Update 31 dec 23: I'm still devastated at update 4 - and I will never played this again - Their servers are so much lighter on loyalty customers aren't they?

VR support!, have to say this is the best VR game so far! Oh and again FREE feature unlike other titles that charge for this.
Nice and relaxing game, there is a lot in game to explore and learn, Ive only just really explored the tip 32 Hrs in, There is thousands of hours worth of content in this. Caters to all ages!
These guys have done a great job and hope it keeps going for years to come!

Add ships and fauna that just break immersion by ignoring collision with the world and even your base. Subtract a planetary map (galaxy map, yes, local map, no) and a reasonable amount of storage space. (Why are game makers so cheap with storage?) 

I will say that the game landscape is very beautiful, the UI isn't too confusing and the player can Fly Around A Star System! That's pretty frikkin cool! Also, building. HG nailed that. Very nice system of construction.

But that tutorial starter quest is like an entrance exam for an elite school. (What is this, EVE?) I had to go off-game to figure it out. Not good for new players. The tutorial is supposed to teach the basics of the game. Instead I was figuring out how to make that ominous red light bar stabilize. (Just find a cave, new folks. You're welcome.)

It feels like the game keeps me at arms length, audibly. Perhaps a text to speech in game bot for translation would be good and simple to program in? (no need to voice over, just robot text to speech).

Yeah game's pretty good now. Nice job Hello Games.

see below for thoughts at release.

I wanted to enjoy this game more, but I feel it just lacks in so many ways. I started off like ""Oh this is pretty cool got to repair my ship."" It seemed fairly promising, but it quickly became very repetitive. Almost every planet is BORING, I have only come across one planet (a snow one) that was genuinely intersting and cool. But other than that every thing has felt almost exactly the same. In the trailers and screenshots they show these amazing planets and environments, but I have yet to experience any of it. So now I find that about 7 hours in I am already bored and see no reason to keep playing. BUT, mods seems like they could be what this game needs so I will keep an ear to the ground and wait. Hopefully, they can save this game. As of now this game is definitely not worth the $60 price tag, if you are considering buying it DON'T.

This game provides a phenomenal experience exploring the vast uncharted expanses of a foreign galaxy while investigating new planets, discovering unique vegetation and lifeforms, as well as trading with other intelligent beings, learning their unique languages along the way.

- First and foremost, the game is about discovery and exploration. If you don't enjoy aimless, wandering gameplay this probably won't be for you. Same goes for your enjoyment of survival crafting.
-Survival elements are the next big ticket item, but it should be noted that a *lot* of the difficulty stuff can't be adjusted to meet your desired gameplay.
-Resource gathering, money making, and base building are all core components too. The base building is pretty optional though, with some small exceptions.
- This game is very very ""zen"", and is often a slow burn. I spent several hours last night just gathering resources and cataloging planets, with a loose objective in my mind.
- Over the years I've played on my PC, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and an M1 Pro Macbook. 
-- By far the best experience I've had is on the M1 Pro (total eye candy). 
-- ROG Ally is a great experience too, but I found the Steam Deck to be very inconsistent performance wise so your mileage may vary. 
-- PC is obviously dependent on your hardware. An Intel Mac will likely be a poor experience since the game targets Apple Silicon, and I'm not even sure if it can run on non Apple Silicon chips. 

I actually preordered No Man's Sky way back when, and on release I actually enjoyed it! However I couldn't recommend it to anyone at the time, because it was ""a mile wide, but an inch deep"". At that time it was just a walking and inventory management simulator.

Since then this game has become next level. I feel that the mis-managed hype pre-release wasn't done from a place of maliciousness, and Hello Games is a studio that just really likes working on NMS and are proud of their work. This game truly is a labor of love, and the quality is out of this world now. The community around this game is also super welcoming.",1703623612,1703623612,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I remember when this game first dropped, and oh boy, it got roasted harder than marshmallows at a campfire. But you know what? Fast forward to now, and it's like Hello Games flipped a switch and turned this thing into a cosmic gem.

First things first, the universe they've built here is downright mind-blowing. I'm talking planets, moons, and stars that make your jaw drop. It's like a sci-fi dream come true. If you're playing with online features you have great community to interact with planets where cities have formed by the players but there are still a few things I would like them to improve on such as more NPCs are needed, it's an unending space with very few interactions on planets it feels lonely when you want to play offline. I won't be surprised if they might just do that with the next update as this game is one of the best games I've played. 

This game is experiencing rapid growth and expanding across various platforms, enhancing the overall gaming experience for a broader player base. Personally, I've enjoyed playing it on the PS5 and have made significant progress. My only regret is the absence of cross-platform save support, a feature that could add even more convenience. The game's increasing diversity and widespread appeal are a testament to its potential, surpassing our initial expectations. Kudos to Hello Games, the real heroes of game development, for not just patching things up but executing a complete cosmic makeover. They've fulfilled players' wish lists with features like bases, freighters, and seamless multiplayer experiences, showcasing their dedication and turning them into the Santa Clauses of the gaming world. May the game's success continue long into the future.

And the story? Oh, they've spiced that up too. Quests that mean something, community events that get the hype train going, and the mysteries of the Atlas – it's like playing through a space opera now. I love it.

But here's the kicker – they've been listening. No Man's Sky runs smoother than a jazz solo now. It's like they fine-tuned everything we griped about. They're not just making a game; they're crafting an experience.

So, if you're still thinking about the No Man's Sky that made headlines for the wrong reasons, snap out of it! This ain't your grandma's game anymore. Hello Games flipped the script, and now it's an intergalactic party that keeps getting better.

No Man's Sky went from zero to hero, and I'm strapping into my virtual spaceship for the long haul. If you haven't been back in a while, trust me, it's time. The universe is calling, and it's one heck of a ride that just keeps getting sweeter.

Rating: 5/5 Stars - A Masterpiece Reborn

Back in 2016, I had dismissed ""No Man's Sky"" as nothing short of a disappointment. It felt like a hollow promise, a universe vast in scope yet shallow in substance. However, what unfolded over the subsequent years is nothing short of a miracle in the gaming industry. Today, I am here to set the record straight: ""No Man's Sky"" has evolved into a masterpiece that stands as a testament to the developers' dedication and love for their creation.

A Universe Reimagined: What was once a barren landscape of repetitive textures and unfulfilled promises has transformed into a vibrant, ever-evolving universe. Each planet I visit now bursts with life, unique biomes, and captivating flora and fauna. The sense of exploration and discovery is genuinely exhilarating - a dream come true for any space exploration enthusiast.

Engaging Gameplay: The addition of base building, multiplayer elements, and a plethora of missions have given ""No Man's Sky"" the depth it initially lacked. Whether you're constructing your own space haven, engaging in space combat, or simply exploring the unknown with friends, the game now offers a rich, engaging experience.

Visual and Audio Masterpiece: Visually, the game is a feast for my eyes. The improved graphics engine renders breathtaking vistas, while the procedural generation ensures that no two experiences are the same. The soundtrack, too, is a sublime companion to your space odyssey, enhancing the sense of wonder and isolation in the vast cosmos.

A Developer's Love Letter: Perhaps the most commendable aspect is the developers' commitment. They didn't abandon ship but instead worked tirelessly to deliver the game everyone hoped for. This level of post-launch support and dedication is rare and praiseworthy.

In conclusion, ""No Man's Sky"" is a shining example of how passion, perseverance, and listening to your community can turn the tides. It's no longer the game that many of us once called ""crap."" It's an odyssey that continues to expand and surprise. It's a journey that I am delighted to be a part of, and I can't wait to see where it takes us next.

""No Man's Sky"" is not just a game; it's a journey of redemption, a beacon of hope for the gaming community, and a universe waiting to be explored. Don't miss out on this unparalleled adventure.",1471036558,1703548609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a great space sandbox. Hunting for sentinel ships, flying around and building different bases it's really engaging. Nonetheless, some bugs are really annoying and they ruin the experience for me. For instance: 
1) The oxygen harvester bug, it burns the fuel but generates oftentimes no oxygen at all. 
2) NPCs sink into the ground regardless if it's a planet or freighter. 
3) Stuff magically disappears in refiners on my freighter with a tiny chance to reappear if I'm lucky. 
4) Stellar collectors or whatever they called often do not collect anything, especially, if the multiplayer option is on.
5) A bug with the pirate freighter. If you destroy it and save a civilian freighter you get no reward. If you leave pirate frigates the civilian freighter is getting attacked again by pirate spaceships.",1702470831,1703545617,False,0,0,0.480349332094192505,0,True,False,False

They've added customizable playthroughs, so you can change your difficulty settings on a whim whenever you want, with whatever mode you start in. You can also lock your settings in, making so you can never change them. You can swap settings at any time you wish to if you don't feel like giving full effort, then swap back to previous settings after you're finished. You can also have the choice of swapping certain rules, all manageable by your command! It's also not just limited by mode, but by a variety of settings. Enemy strength, free purchases, even lowering the cost of things. These are just a few of the settings you can choose from, not to mention the full templates you can go through as well. Custom game modes are extremely fun!

You have new freighter updates, create very real-ish ship interiors and decorate them how you want to! Show off your findings via holographic images. Through the creatures you've encountered, having a full museum onboard. You can now collect a ton of ships too without having to get a freighter first! You can even just possess a singular freighter for mobile base and create your own farms on it like never before! The new interior designs make for a great way to farm plant matter to create into craftable items to sell in the market.

You can hire your own fleet, having a flurry of military patrollers shoot down incoming threats, or summon your squadron to help you. You can even sell ships to NPCs and immediately recruit them into your squad to have a totally unique ship!

There are many more updates to talk about! It is a good game if you like space games, but there's also pets, collecting, farming, survival, etc. If you like those things, then you'll like this game.",1618262030,1703261441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the variety of the items and spaceships and other devices and vehicles is so much and as a collector makes a good challenge for you to find all kind of them.
the combat system becomes so easy when you have a paralysis mortar.

the bugs in this game:
- you may put some items in the refinery room in your freighter and then you summon it to another location what happens is the items will disappear, you lost them for good. they may or may not reappear after some time.
- there is a maximum depth you can dig, and some times some buried items spawn beneath it and you cant dig them.

It is very short on a linear story line that you can speed-run in a few hours, wrong game for that, it also is not a substitute for COD or GTA.  This is a laid back casual game which expects you to be able to 'drive' your own adventure.

It has an excellent build mechanic that can be used to build all manner of things. You can build on ANY planet and there are SO MANY! Also you will get a freighter that can be your mobile base / city or a hub for your fleet and squadron. There is so much to do here that sometimes it is hard to decide what you want to do next. Multiplayer still has issues, but this started as a solo game and it is not that easy to just bolt on multiplayer.

They give you the shovel and bucket, it is up to you to design and build the sandcastles / adventures.

Only issue is performance, ill admit i dont exactly invest in prime computer software and hardware so im not running it the best i can. its pretty slow, but if i can find a way to make it run faster, i will have ZERO complaints.

*Fixed a broken ship
*met a space turtle
*met what looked like zoidberg
*befriended an animal
*found earth (a planet that just looked like a human forest biome)
*killed some robots
*got killed by robot dogs
*got killed by pirates
*got killed due to harsh environments
*wept
*got  back up
*killed pirates
*destroyed a frigate
*killed all the robots
*gave robogod the middle finger and stole his shit

*dealt with alien governments



this next list is some things i hope they add to the game
*Base building
*colonies of aliens
*be able to buy a HUGE ASS SPACESHIP
*gain companions
*melee weapons (optional)
*ground combat with aliens (like, i wanna be able to shoot the reptile guys when i see em on a planet)
*be able to kill everything on the space stations and destroy them

I bought this recently on sale, many years after initial release, so I imagine the game has improved quite a lot since then. But I can only recommend this game as a mostly single-player experience. Multiplayer seems like mostly an afterthought, with large amounts of de-syncing. It is not a good feeling when you search for a resolution for a specific bug and the community replies to just turn off all multiplayer functionality. Additionally, ship combat and flight controls feel weak but I guess this is okay for the target audience; if you're use to flying your ship like a mad-man in Elite Dangerous, you'll be disappointed. I would even say that the flight controls in Freelancer (2003) feel more responsive. Base building is kinda lame when it comes to terraforming, you'll see all the terrain regenerate and clip into your structures but some of the community insists that this is okay and ""working as designed"". So as I've seen other suggest, build upwards to overcome this. Finally, getting the frigate so early feels like it defeats the purpose of a planet-side base. When I can just build a max level refinery on my frigate, why bother going through the phases at the base, plus having to power them.

You can really play this game however you'd like, and though other might not like this level of freedom, for those who do it's incredible. The community (from what I have experienced so far) is so great and wholesome! I went to the player hub and sent a chat message out asking for help with a mission. A veteran player (since the launch back in 2016) helped me out, and after I told them this was my first ""team mission"" and that I was new to the game, they welcomed me to the game, telling me some tips, giving me advice about upgrades, and after the mission even gave me a few items that would help me along the way and said I could come back to him anytime for help or with questions or to just have a fun time!!

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

In fact No Man’s Sky was probably one of the most anticipated games of that year. However, we received a buggy, glitchy mess on release with almost zero content. The game was beyond disappointing. Even back in 2017 when I think I got the game it was just barren and lacked content. This was a game that I would have never recommended to people, a 1 out of 10. And that’s not even mentioning the reputation of the studio. There is a good saying that reputation takes years to build but moments to lose. And I think this saying fits perfectly. Hello Games lost their reputation in just moments because of the horrible release of No Man’s Sky. However, since then the developers at Hello Games have continued to pour their hearts and souls into the game and it has paid off. The game has become a masterpiece and the studio have rebuilt their reputation after years of hard work. The game is ripe with content after adding new releases year after year free of charge. And with the recent release of the Echos update, it has really shown how much of a masterpiece this game is. I think the best part of this game is that it isn’t all too confusing. One of my main issues with Star Citizen is that I can’t play it while being half asleep or I suppose high as a kite. But with No Man’s Sky there is still a structure but it's much simpler to understand. To top this off the game runs extremely well on the Steamdeck and there aren’t any DRM problems when playing offline. Thus, it is my most played game when on the road. All in all, this game for me is an easy 10 out of 10. The exploration, music, and game mechanics all make No Man’s Sky an incredible experience. And I think that No Man’s Sky is probably one of the best examples of a comeback that a studio has been able to pull off. And with the recent information surrounding their next title Light No Fire, I have no doubt they will be able to pull it off.",1703057487,1703057487,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

It saddens me that the game has gotten so many bad reviews from people who were very obviously not the target audience. From the absolute get-go it's been made clear that this game is mostly about exploring and discovering things. Sure you can trade and do other stuff but it was pretty obvious to me that that wasn't the true focus and intent of the game.
Another thing I keep seeing is that the price tag is too high for what you get, but you're also paying for any future updates and content. But I guess they'd rather prefer a game that costs 60 bucks and also comes with a dozen DLC to buy. If you're the type of person who can't live with having to play the game with less content until more is added, then you shouldn't pre-order or buy things at release.

Anyway, I love this game for the same reason I loved Minecraft. It's essentially endless and I keep finding out new things that surprise me. The Atlas ""storyline"" is also pretty amazing so far and I'm actually really glad they put it in there. Kind of gives me the option to change things up a bit if I get tired of hunting for that 1 species that's eluding me on a planet.
The game is visually beautiful, comes with an incredible soundtrack and offers enough gameplay variety to keep you busy for dozens of hours. And this is not counting future updates and added content.

---------

Update many years later (2023). Picked the game back up again after a long hiatus, it's basically a completely different game now and it's still ridiculous amounts of fun. I still recommend the game... but not with the same glee as I did 7 years ago, despite almost 300 hours of game time. Approach the game as an exploration game with base building and minimal quests. Think of it as Minecraft in space, and you will likely love it. Below I will explain in more detail.

SPOILERS START HERE

SERIOUSLY STOP READING IF YOU CARE

FINAL WARNING

Since you're still reading, I will get down to it. The main quest ending is absolute dogwater. The main quest sends you on this massive undertaking with amazing build up and interesting lore but the payoff is just not there. If you read that and you still want to experience it, for the love of god make sure you store all your technology before the last jump. And then KEEP IT STORED as you approach the final part. The level of frustration it caused in me to jump to the core and pop out the other side with ALL of my tech broken, which I then spent 90 minutes fixing, only for the game to send you on one last portal jump which, of course, breaks ALL YOUR DAMN TECH AGAIN. I used all my resources to fix it the first time. Portals usually break only 1 thing, I was not expecting a full system failure twice in a row, I can't afford to fix my fully kitted out exosuit, multi tool and starship all over again. And the kicker is that the endgame is basically the same stuff you were doing before. I might as well have just not gone to the core. So I recommend the game, if you see it as exploration and base building with minimal quests. Spare yourself the pain and just watch a youtube video of the ending though.",1471264291,1702943462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state since lately the decisions have focused more on the new game with multiplayer Light no Fire.  If you wish to solo this game and know what you are doing this is a great game for you.  If you have the time watching a lot of videos before doing these weekly expeditions and not make a huge mistake in the game like I did mid way through the expedition in a week by knowing the game inside and out to fix this fatal error.  I would recommend this game for you.  For casuals and those without a lot of time including wishing to do multiplayer I would hold off on this game now until they recognize doing expeditions in a week isn't a great idea.  Two weeks for expeditions would be much better to replay them not a week.  So whoever is reading this make sure you watch a content creator fully before these expeditions if you don't know what you are doing or returning after a long while.

(LOL wish I’d waited a bit before changing the resolution though. After the restart the planet I ended up on wasn’t nearly as hospitable!) Out side of the very odd and rare momentary shudder, I’m running into zero problems with the game and getting a typical framerate of 50fps. To be fair, I haven’t tried to Alt-Tab in/out of the game so I can’t speak to that issue and as far as the “freshness” of my drivers is concerned, I haven’t updated them in a few weeks so I don’t know if their current or not.

My biggest problem is the game itself. After about 8 hours I feel pretty comfortable saying this is the most frustrated I’ve ever been being this bored. I’m all for not being spoon fed a tutorial but there’s a sharp difference between that and being tossed into the deep end with zero advice and instruction. So in no particular order:

Interface

It too me several tried just to figure out that you had to hold the button down to make a selection! There is at least one icon on the screen that I have absolutely no idea what it means (If anyone knows, it resembles the outline of a backpack and it’s near where the jetpack icon shows up.)

(BTW it took me 4 or 5 hours to discover that while you’re scanning an object if you press the right thumb stick you get multiple levels of zoom.)

On a tangent, I’d LOVE to be able to set way points! I’ve literally lost track of a destination more time that I can remember. And why can’t I make a map of a planet? (And then use said map to “autopilot” to and from known locations!)

Flying

**I HATE FLYING IN THIS GAME** It’s a good thing that you can’t crash into the ground or I’d be dead sooooooo many times already!

Landing

Anyone figure out how to land exactly where you want to yet? I have landed right next to the landing pad of so many outposts that it’s no longer funny (landing/taking off from the landing pad supposedly doesn’t cost any fuel.)

What am I doing again?

IS there a way to pull up what’s next to do in the early stages of the game? I wandered to 3 other planets before managing to check off the next box on my initial to do list because I had no idea what I needed to to and missed it when it showed up on the screen the first time.

SOME KIND OF HINTS!

I wasted a perfectly good (and charged!) hyperdive (my first one to boot!) trying to swap ships (after finding a better (well bigger anyway) one crashed on a planet. (For reference, you have to transfer material to the damaged ship first, then repair the damage. (Of course, doing that transfers control to the damaged ship abandoning your old ship, but you can always just return to your old ship and reverse the process to reclaim it.) (Why CAN’T I swap engines/weapons/shields between vessels? After all I installed and repaired them in the first place didn’t I?

All in all, it’s not rally a bad game it just suffers from a lack of direction, a sense that you actually need to do something. Now I haven’t made my first warp jump yet, (I need to recharge my hyperdrive...again...) so maybe that get better once you’re out of the initial system but as for right now my impression of the game is...Meh.  

As it stands now, there's nothing that stands out about it enough to warrent reccomending it to others.

Now to be objective and honest in my review, I have to admit that I never enjoyed the combat on foot in this game, even after improvements they made, it's just not very fun IMO because it really feel like it's kind of added on top and not part of the core game play and more precisely, I just find it hard to aim and the weapons are so so. But I have always played with controller so maybe with mouse  or VR it's good ? It just wasn't for me. Combat in your ship is actually decent but feels a bit too simplified and too easy unless you are overwhelmed  but still there is no real strategy  until you attack way bigger ships , only then it's a bit better.

Also the creatures in the worlds are still a bit too weird for me, some are really good and you actually feel like you want them as pets or mounts, but many just seem weird in an illogical way, they don't fit their environment and how a creature would evolve in this kind of place. Even for a science-fiction setting. 

The first main story is not amazing ( The Artemis quest) , it doesn't matter too much until you realise that some NPC who give different quest are locked until you have done the main story. When it's the first time you play it's ok , but when you make a new game it feels like a chore to have to go through again. Once you pass the Artemis quest , it's ok but it's a long quest and I wish I could just skip it. Now you can totally play the game without doing it but then you can't unlock what's after and that's the most interesting to me. 

I also wish there was a lot of random quests that are not necessary linked to anything and not mandatory but it would give me more incentive to explore to try to find this kind of quests, just for fun and push the feeling that there is always more to discover.

Last  point, I wish there was more diversity on the planets themselves , and not only one  type of environment all over. it doesn't make you want to explore more of the same world and what they could offer it it was at least a little more diverse.
It would not work for all planets or moon as for some it's kind of logic that if the whole planet is desolated, you won't have a forest on the other side, and I agree with that. But it would be nice to see some planets with like an icy pole, and desert on the other side  or some other mix.

Overall, I know this looks like a negative review, but it's only a list of things I wish would really improve, the game itself is great and I can only praise VERY HIGHLY  all the efforts and love that Hello Game put into it, and I respect them so much for not trying to empty your wallet like most of the other greedy modern games. Just buy and play , no BS, no cash shop.

This game is worth it at full price, but again it's very often on sale and it's great so more people can experience it or buy it again on another platform like I did about 3 times and no regrets after. We all know this is a rare feeling nowadays with modern gaming...

1. [b]Gunplay[/b] - I cannot turn off mouse acceleration completely. I can reduce it from the menu, but I cant turn it off. Which would be a major dealbreaker if there was any significant gunplay. Most of the bullets I shot during my playthrough was shooting at doors. Where are alien invasions and raids on your base/ship/frigate? There are these big behemoths in the trailer, do you fight them? No, you either shoot at literal doors or some wild defenceless animals. Terraria and Minecraft are also not combat focused games but their core combat loop is much more polished.
2. [b]Ship combat[/b] - Put a paperweight on your S key and left mouse then go grab a sandwich. Pump in sodium into to shields to recharge them for some reason. You cannot have frigate to frigate combat or seige space stations. There is no war mechanics or raiding. Literally all other space games I have played handled it better.
3. [b]Sentinels[/b] - No mans sky equivalent of GTA wanted levels. The justification for their presence is weak sauce. Something... something... Atlas. Whenever they show up I just dig a hole with terrain manipulator until the heat goes away. In space its harder because you have to time your jump just right or it will be jammed.
4. [b]Story[/b] - Something... something... simulation. Too much reading I couldn't be asked. The campaign is just filled with busy work. I neither felt invested nor had fun.
5. [b]Base building[/b] - In most sandbox games, bases have both form and function. Here there is only form, no function. Yeah, the base protects you from the elements but so does digging a hole. The frigate in mid game renders that poinless as well.
6. [b]Exploration[/b] - Exploration in games like minecraft or terraria feels epic because the game developers put effort into making exploration worth it. Here there is just drab planet after planet with some hazardous environment which makes exploration more of a hassle than actually worth it.
7. [b]Language learning game[/b] - When you first contact with aliens you only see giberish and you can ask them literally ONE word of their language then it is added to your collection. This serves no purpose and is a complete waste of time, just avoid.
8. [b]Too many things to recharge[/b] - In minecraft you just need to worry about hunger and health. Here you need 6-8 different things topped up with different fuel at all times. I know there is a gamemode which gets rid of that, but I will still rage.
9. [b]Intergalatic loading screens too long[/b] - Whats the deal with that?
10. [b]Flora and fauna scanning[/b] - You get a pittance for scanning wildlife on a planet. Avoid this mechanic, waste of time.
11. [b]Factory chains[/b] - Just mine gold from asteroids and buy what you need. Its grindy and brainless. 
12. [b]Procedurally generated content[/b] - You have no idea how many times I went in the same building in different worlds in different systems. I am sure there are less than 10 models which are not even randomized.

I've always wanted to  try it out and now I did. And I am just 50 hours in... and o my god. 

This game is big. The precissiongenerating is absolutely nuts. When I first zoomed in the map my jaw dropped. 
First of all i couldn't believe how open the game is. I was a bit disappointing that It doesn't have natural HOTAS support, and the flying was kind of flunky. Yet now I know that's just the starting ships with no upgrades.

The base construction is extremely good developed, I still don't feel like close to unlocking 50% of it and I can do so much with the teraforming tools. 
While playing I was thinking how can a developer like Bethesda fail so much with a lot more money to spend... 
The combat looks cheesy at first, but with proper difficulty setting is quite the challenge and get's more sophisticated. You will need specific updates to fight elites. The Whole ship upgrades and freighters fighting is absolutely insane. Even the derelict missions are quite creepy and fit the whole ""lost in space"" idea. Loved everything about it. Hunting special ships is now a never ending side quest for me. 

The resource/materials gathering and building and combining makes me regret skipping school. It gets quite interesting as I unlock more and more complicated recipes. Money flows and gets spent too fast and it feels overall really dynamic. 

The moment I found a teleport things changed as well, now it feels like way more connected with the whole community. It's a feeling one should just experience that himself/herself. 

Now about the story. I was definitely not expecting this. When I started it, it was arcade-y for me, did not think there's much worth in it. And even in that case the game sort of forces me to pay attention to small details. I ended up so invested in it that I stopped doing anything and focusing in the story mission. I am on the last day from the last quest but I will not share the spoiler. It's just I don't know what happens next and I am scared to rush it but, i surely end up doing it anyhow. It's just crazy and unexpected good. 

I don't think it will be the case but I hope the game goes way past the end of the story while managing to keep the sense of purpose in it. Just overall 10/10 in every aspect. I am so picky, and I just can't find anything big I can beef about. My HoSaS system is gathering dust and I really don't care about it at the moment. Just one more quest at 5am...

it does miss a few opportunities i feel would have varied the experience a little more. and its highly possible they are working on it. Such as getting more planets with different gravity. Having every planet except airless have the same gravity i feel is a missed mark. it may not add a lot to the core game play, but i feel it would add to the experience a little. as well as any form of ship customization. i do note that it would take away from the rarity of some ships, but even just letting us change the color would be nice. we can already upgrade the class and the inventory size, but we cant adjust the color, but we can adjust the color of the freighters?? it may be coming an update though, so just a nitpick. the last complaint is the ""tutorial"". i feel like it does explain stuff, but not really in a ""new player"" fashion. I was having to walk my friends through majority of the first half of the game, as they had no idea what to do. they began to catch on around hour 2 and saw where to look and how to read the UI, but learning that i feel could be improved just a little. again not a huge complaint but just something that could be improved to retain new player attention. 

All in all, you have to give it the time to learn the systems, learn the UI, and finish the ""tutorial"" but then the game really is fun for as long as you want it to be, and with all the twitchy shooters out, it is a relaxing breath of fresh air to come into this game and just enjoy slowing down and smelling the roses a little. 

Highly recommend as a Minecraft alternative or a casual chill-and-explore game.

However the Co-Op experience leaves a lot to be desired, I pray this changes in the future, being able to share quests, and build bases/freighters together without limitations would be awesome!

Its been quite some time, but the developers finally made good on the majority of what was promised prior to launch, and added a significant amount of content above and beyond this at no cost to the player. I believe based on this and based on how the game has been supported all these years after, that it deserves a Thumbs Up. A long time coming, but they finally made things right in the end.

AUG 19 2016 Patch v1.03
70 Hour Review

At around the 30ish hour mark you will find you have collected most, if not all of the tech upgrades. Shortly after this your suit, tool and ship will likely be maxxed out in terms of functionality and power. After this point, having more inventory upgrades or a bigger ship is somewhat pointless due to the fact you do not need to gather resources aside from maintaining charge on your gear and jump fuel to reach the center. The fact that after 30ish hours you will have seen most, if not all of the content available means that the subsequent time spent is simply a grind to jump to the center of the universe, which at maximum jump range will likely take 600 to 700 jumps. Assuming you stock up on materials to craft jump fuel periodically along the way this is a monumental and completely unnecessary grind. Top this off with the game as it is calculating your jump range max at around 1650 LY, but due to launch changes increasing the universe size 10x, your linear jump distance to the core only shows 10% of that jump range distance gained when you actually jump. Since I did not realize these things during my first review I must change my recommendation to DEFINITELY NOT recommended, unless you like simply exploring planets repetitively with no new content, no real purpose or goal. I may come back to review again after the development team adds the excessive amount of content they showed in previews for the game prior to release but cut out of the game without informing the players before launch.

15 Hour Review

Space and planetary exploration that doesnt force the player to feel rushed or constrained. This game as it is now is more suited to adult players - in the sense that it doesnt hold your hand or have you riding on rails like other games built for children often do. A decently enjoyable semi casual experience despite the rocky launch. I suspect future patches will take this game to new and exciting places! Looking forward to playing again. This review will be appended with additional reviews in the future.

the main story has a lot of cosmic horror spookiness, and that's due to some amazing writing, possibly one of my favorite instances of cosmic horror in games

theres a little fomo with the time limited expeditions, but i'm sure theyre super cool for dedicated players! unfortunately tho it feels like they're made specifically FOR dedicated players, because if you're new, you'll be pretty lost and have to look up how to get a bunch of the required materials.

my one big gripe is that the game starts to feel a little samey after a handful of hours, so you have to find your own fun or you will burn out FAST. there's great base building, missions, customization, and progression with new tools and ships and upgrades, but the moment to moment exploration gameplay just didnt hook me, and i fell off after like 4-6 hours.

it seems like an AMAZING roleplay game where you can really feel yourself building familiarity with the world, but for me, i just dont feel like that's worth my time because i'll only stay engaged with new content, and that new content (expeditions) basically requires a new save

also, WEIRD performance drops, like really severe. it gets fixed if you restart but man it TANKS frames after a while.

In the past decade we have seen that passion and dedication win in the long run when it comes to games with rocky launches.  Although we as gamers are extremely critical of titles entering the space, I feel we are also extremely forgiving and love to see passionate developers more than anything else.  

We all love a good comeback story. No man's sky is a testament to this. So is cyberpunk 2077 just to name a few.  Hell let loose has had a very tumultuous few months since the new development team took over, but it seems the new development team is listening to their consumers and slowly regaining their respect and trust.

No man's sky should be celebrated not just for the brilliant game play they have produced, But for their love, passion, intensity and dedication to the game as well.  The gaming industry is under threat by con artists, scamers,  venture capitalists and people who have no real vested interest in creating a work of Art, but only to produce some **** that is just good enough to get you to spend your money and nothing else. 

So yes in short by this title. Not only are you getting the game in its current state, but it seems guaranteed that you are getting the game in all of its future configurations as well.  The number of updates to this game that had been free of charge are absolutely astounding.

There are plenty of games in early access with far less active development teams.",1702744312,1702744390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is it flawless?  No.  In fact I can point to the main storyline as it's most glaring flaw.  Without spoiling it, it makes the whole exploration of the 16 galaxies seem without purpose.  The game can be grindy at some points, but once you get into it you find ways to mitigate this very quickly even from starting a new game.  And of course, there is very little reason to explore unless you are looking for something in particular (which is usually a smaller detail).  But the star cluster you start around is just as good as the next (more or less).  And lastly the multiplayer aspect is ho-hum.  Good to have it.  But not the best implementation.  Has issues with things like terrain resetting or weather popping around to sync up both players.  Which means if you are underground and someone comes around, suddenly your digging is refilled.

That all being said.  The game's tech (proc gen) is probably the best I have ever seen.  It is fast and seemless.  And it does look good (even when viewing what you've seen already).  There are plenty of activities to do.  Newer features have built up the experience quite a bit and each...ahem iteration ... has gotten better.


After a while planets become very much the same thing arranged in different order.  

You can only have one frieghter in a system making multiplayer grouping silly.  And things are gererally easy to acquire if not just handed to you for little or no effort.

The best feature the game has is the universe of RNG planets with RNG fauna and flora, it's not infinite thou, eventually you'll struggle to find something that feels really new.

BUT...

There is no challenge. The game is just a grind.

If you fought the enemies on a planet and beat em once, you have seen everything the game has to offer land combat wise. The AI is too simple and buggy. The battles on space used to be a little more challenging, but only cause the ship maneuverability is awful, and enemy ship AI is capable of doing stuff you can't (like very sharp and fast turns). Since now they added a ""hold this button to dogfight automatically"" mechanic, they essentially removed almost all the challenge to fighting in space. There wasn't much challenge to begin with anyway, most space fights boil down to ""do you have enough nitrate to keep your shield charged?"".

The points of interest on a planet are not diverse/random. Once you've seen one of each you know them all, as they are always the same. This has been the case since release, and they never did anything to introduce variety to this aspect of the game, specially considering that the players are required to visit multiple of these. It just makes the grind more tedious and the shallowness of the gameplay more obvious.

The UX is horrible. After so many years in development I still don't get why they haven't fixed it yet. Maybe they like making players miserable. For some reason almost everything requires you to hold a key, not tap it. Everything requires multiple steps and multiple windows. There are no filters of any kind anywhere, and eventually everything fills up with just too much stuff.

On a related topic, the crafting system is awful. There's no way to craft multiple items at once, and every craft is holding down a key, then release, the hold again, etc. Then imagine having to do this for recipes with multiple crafting steps... You end up just buying the items you need instead... is so much faster.

Base building mechanics were initially very simple, very intuitive, now they are a convoluted mess with an awful UX. The first iteration of base building had simple modular bases, you just put a room and a door and you had a base. This modules are still available but only later in the game, instead players have to build their first base out of wooden planks like a primitive life-form. Kudos for including a build camera, all base building games should have this feature.

For reasons unknown they also added an electricity system at some point, which really serves no purpose other that be a nuisance, specially cause every modular building piece requires electricity now... maybe it was a way to push people to start using the other system? Well... at least there's an option to disable electricity if you want.

The game was not made for multiplayer, it's a singleplayer experience through and through. Having someone play along side you can be helpful, as you can share resources, but you both be mostly doing your own stuff on your own... there is not much stuff to do together. Also, the multiplayer is really buggy, lots of desyncs (experiencing different stuff though being right next to each other), personal quests sometimes bug out when doing it along someone else, some stuff can be looted by everyone some cannot, etc...

Story wise the game is actually well written, if I remember correctly there was a big name in scifi literature involved with the game originally, but the delivery is really bad. It's just text dump after text dump, and the game being so grindy just make you skip most of it, as you just want the reward and the text is in the way. It also doesn't help that some of it is garbled until you become proficient in some of the 4 different languages, which you can only learn one word at a time.",1702561196,1702561196,False,3,0,0.505084991455078125,3,True,False,False

""Finally, the sky shall be ours and ours alone! Muahaha!""

Unpestered by solitude and under the influence of a moderate dose of psychedelics, I roamed the vast emptiness of space, scouring systems for paradise planets to name after famous lesbians. 

However, even as I spread my feminine hold over the galaxy, Hello Games seemed determined to make peace with the men who'd left in droves, and diligently worked month after month, year after year, patching, repairing, expanding, and delivering. The men began to slowly return, suspicious at first, and eventually with great enthusiasm.  

While I may have been forced to cede interstellar territory to Men for Whomst the Sky was Not intended, it's hardly been a bitter pill to swallow.  Incredible development progress has been made over the past 7 years, and it's impossible to deny that the game is much better today than it was before, even if you (like myself) were dating an indie game developer in 2016 and thus had incredibly measured expectations for a dev team of 15 people in the first place. 
 
I was refused a boarding pass for the hype train, due to vaguely understanding the limitations imposed on individual developers by the mere fact of only 24 hours existing in a single day, and an awareness of the impact of artificially imposed launch deadlines that fail to respect non-linear development progress. 
For that reason, I didn't feel the game was  ever a failure... But having played the game years later, with the massive (free, by the way) expansions and the improved graphics and the DLC and the community that grew along with the base game, the original launch sucked balls b comparison, and I'd be a loon to suggest otherwise.

If you were on that hype train and haven't come back to it since the initial launch, you ought to consider revisiting.

No Mans Sky, as a result of the development team's continued devotion to their craft and confidence of  concept, had by 2020 certainly met or exceeded the expectations of its original audience, even if the sky now has a bunch of men in it.",1702532284,1702532284,True,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I have to admit that the scenery is quite beautiful, but unfortunately beauty isn't everything. At the time of this review I have clocked about 1.6 hours on steam, and I am seriously debating at requesting a refund and purchasing this game again when they've fixed all the issues. 

Now to get to my issues:

I started the download a few minutes after 1 PM EST, which lasted a mere few minutes before being completed. 

I launched the game and was immediately thrown into action as soon as the splash screens ended. I received a neat notification that I had discovered the planet I was stranded on. My first instinct was to simply walk around and look at the gorgeous scenery of my newly discovered planet when a pop up notification alt-tabbed me out of the game. I tried to alt-tab back in, but was unable to resume my gameplay. Using the task-manager I performed the ""End Task"" action and simply restarted the game.

 Upon re-launch of the game I was thrown onto a completely new planet, once again receiving the notification that I was the person to discover this planet. Since I hadn't really done anything with my initial launch I simply shrugged it off and started playing again. After an hour and 25 minutes of gameplay, I had explored a good amount of the planet's surface while simultaneously getting credit for having discovered a ton of species and fauna I had come across (One of the flying species required me to climb a mountain and wait for it to fly by in order to scan it). I could track my exploration progress by pressing the ESC button, which showed me how much of the planet I had discovered as well as my status as being ""online"". At this point I alt-tabbed (unfortunately I had forgotten what happened earlier), and was unable to tab back into the game. The only option I had at this point was to force close the program and re-launch the game for a third time. At this point I was a bit worried since I wasn't sure that I would spawn back onto the same planet, as my earlier experience with restarting the game threw me onto a completely new planet. Luckily, I was not thrown onto a new planet but instead was spawned back on the same planet. However, all my progress had been lost. To ensure that this wasn't a simple connection glitch, I decided to ""Quit to Desktop"" and launch the game again. Unfortunately, even after restarting the game and re-connecting to the online servers my past progress did not show up in-game. 

I cannot stress how frustrating it is to lose all the progress I had made because the alt-tabbing feature doesn't work properly. It said that I was connected to the online servers my entire game play session, so I am unable to understand why my exploration progress was lost to begin with. Does it not upload our discoveries to the online server upon us getting credit for them? 

I feel like a player losing all their progress is a potential risk in playing an early access game, but I honestly did not expect to have such an error occur in a finished product that was pushed back twice before being released. 

At the current state of the game I cannot recommend it, but if you do decide to try it out be sure to stay away from the alt-tab buttons and manually save your game by jumping into the cockpit of your ship.

---Updated Review---
A friend recently recommended that I re-install the game and check out all the new content added to the game. I have to say, I am completely blown away at what the game has turned into! It feels like an entirely different game from the last time I played it, which technically it is since so many features have been added that didn't exist when the game came out. While there are still some issues while playing multiplayer, the overall experience is amazing and it's clear that the developers are very passionate about their work (it really shows!). I feel like the minimum I could do to show my appreciation of their incredible work over the years is to update my review, if you're into open world survival/exploration type games I highly recommend you check this game out. If you already own the game but haven't played in a few years, re-install the game and check out all the new content that has been added!

The game world consists of a near infinite number of procedurally generated galaxies, each of which contain a large amount of star systems that subsequently contain a number of exoplanets.
This structure doesn't aim to emulate existing star systems in our own universe like for like, using an entirely procedurally generated formula that produces random results constantly.
This structure is applied to every aspect of the game, from space to planetary surfaces, and although there are certain objects like Space Stations and buildings on planetary surfaces that seem to have a more standardised formula, there is usually some aspect attributed to them that will make them unique from other locations.

The core gameplay loop that the game is designed around is essentially to hop from one of these exoplanets to the next while scanning, mining, acquiring goods, taming creatures, fighting drone like enemies named sentinels and biological horrors, creating bases and crafting and other similar more traditional survival mechanics.
The crafting mechanics the game offers are abundant, although not at the very top of it's class in the survival genre in my opinion.
There is typically a limited amount of data you can scan, resources you can extract etc. per planet, so you are incentivised to go to other planets to acquire what you would not have access to on one planet alone.

Although the player has the ability to traverse space, it is clear that it's purpose is to act as more of an intermediary location from the planet to planet exploration.
Each star system typically will have one Space Station, which is essentially a giant trading hub that possess's features only attainable there.
There are also a number of random encounters that you may come across in space, from pirate fights to traders looking to trade.

The game does have combat mechanics, both on planet via your multi-tool, which has weapon functionality that you can craft, and in space via your starship.
The quality of the combat is satisfactory, it doesn't feel particularly impactful but is fun nonetheless.
It didn't come across as tedious or as an unwanted, tacked on feature to me which I feel is adequate for the function it serves in the context of the game.

Despite using an entirely randomly generated world, No Man's Sky does have many narrative elements to it, although it is more of a secondary function of the game behind the survival mechanics.
There are multiple different alien races with their own history & lore. 
There is a main quest that offers an interesting narrative that I was satisfied with upon completing.
This main quest also acts as a great way to introduce the game and it's abundance of mechanics to the player when first playing.
There are also some smaller side quests in addition to in game achievements and titles that you can earn for performing a number of actions such as harvesting a certain amount of plant etc.
All of these are the main progression based aspects of the game which act as a nice goal to have while playing through the exploration based mechanics of the game.

Given that it is an exploration based sandbox game at heart, these progression focused areas add specific goals for the player but tend to only last for a small portion of the early to mid game of a playthrough.
Other goals that have trended among the community currently or in the past include starship hunting, rare planet or biome hunting, or trying to travel to the center of the universe.
The fact that this list is as long as it is and many veteran players continue to  play this game in new ways constantly is a big indicator of the quality and scope of the sandbox this game provides.

The developer, Hello Games, have continued time and again to release huge patches and updates filled with new content all for no cost to the player.
These updates are big enough in scale to be reasonably compared to a typical paid DLC expansion that you would receive from most major triple A studios.
Each update typically has a particular theme associated with it, with the majority of content added within it following this theme in some way.
For example, one of these past updates was known as 'OUTLAWS' and consisted of improved space combat, outlaw systems, the ability to recruit your own squadron of pilots etc.
Another common game mode that is introduced with new updates are Community Expeditions, which are essentially time limited journeys that give you a number of tasks to perform in a variety of locations in return for rewards not obtainable in a regular save game.
I find these Community Expeditions in particular to be very enjoyable, the guided structure and quick time frame makes them both challenging and entertaining.

The game also boasts a variety of standard game modes available to the player constantly, the basic most common being known as Survival, in addition to there being a more building focused Creative mode and even a hardcore 'Permadeath' mode where, as the name implies, your save is wiped upon dying.

No Man's Sky is also a sort of semi multiplayer game, with the ability to play both single and multi player in the same world depending on whether you have the relevant setting enabled.
The community in general in this game is very strong and positive, a lot of the Community Expeditions mentioned above are often completed with teamwork amongst the community, and there is also this very impressive, massive community hub in game known as the Space Anomaly that is summonable on command in space that allows you to see worlds and creations of others instantly.

I was initially skeptical about this game upon hearing all of the controversy surrounding it when it released back in 2016, however I picked it up in a Steam sale for about half price about a year ago and am now very happy with this decision. 
I would happily pay the current full price of €58.99 today given the amount of potential play time and content available.
No Man's Sky ranks in my top 5 survival games of all time and may be the very best exploration game specifically that I have played.

[Shakespeare may have played this game:
""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""]

In late 2023, shortly following the viewing of the VGA, I chose to finally revisit this title, and potentially reassess my opinion.  In short, I concluded that the game isn't idiotic, and may very well have deep meaning to somebody, but I couldn't bear the process of digging deep enough to discover if it has meaning for me.

Sadly, I have concluded that No Man's Sky remains a game that I cannot recommend.  It is more than content-rich - it is a vast, VAST sandbox of immense potential, if you enjoy what the game offers.  I will admit this: the moment one lifts off from a planet, that first time, and seamlessly transitions from the surface of a planet to outer space, it is magical.  However, the rest of the game failed to meet that moment.  The pace was absolutely purgatorial for me - and I LOVE crafting survival-style games, and I found the effort of scouring the surface of a mildly hostile planet for various elements to be almost immediately tedious.  The game is a constant presentation of little challenges, and does provide the feeling of accomplishment when you deduce the means of overcoming them...  but some of that challenge is, unfortunately, baked into the odd method of interaction with the menu and controls.  I found that I strongly dislike the menus and the means of selecting items, crafting, and nearly every other interactive element.  This may change for a veteran player, but to me, I couldn't stomach getting that far.  The act of discovering a space station for the first time, rather than feed the joy of discovery, felt like a confusing let-down.  Meeting additional aliens, and starting the process of learning their language, one word at a time, was to me a ""Groundhog's Day"" scenario of nightmare repetition.

It's almost a stupid thing to say, but there's no way I got close to experiencing all that this game has to offer - the truth of the matter is, nobody can.  The game is too big for that.  The barrier I cannot overcome is this: after re-familiarizing myself with No Man's Sky circa 2023, I didn't want to even try.",1472540533,1702502445,False,2,1,0.526423156261444092,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong; this game is incredibly impressive from a technical standpoint. But it's too much of a toy or dollhouse, and not enough of a game. 

Yes, sure, you can collect lots of outfits, and you can make a base, and you can even tame pets. But if you're looking for something that has more direction and focus, that challenges you, that asks you to overcome obstacles, or entices you with an engaging narrative alongside meaningful exploration, then this game might not be for you.

--

In detail:

The game is really easy. And by that I mean, there's really no meaningful challenge, anywhere. The game never asks you to figure something out. There's combat, but it's very easy. There are puzzles: Easy. You have to worry about oxygen and radiation, but the solutions are obvious and simple. You have to collect resources, but it's trivial, just time consuming.

There's a story. It's text-only; no voice over, no animations, and the writing could be better. So far, it seems to serve as just a tutorial for the sandbox. It lacks weight, focus, emotion. This is unlike, say, Subnautica, a similar game that I enjoyed more, which grounded me in a character on a mission from the opening scene, all the way through the ending.

Exploration. It's painfully obvious that each world and everything in it was created by an algorithm. I like other games that feature procedurally-generated content, but the extent to which No Man Sky relies upon it is unmatched. Better designed games create spaces specifically for humans to explore, in ways that lead to surprise, enjoyment, feelings of danger; gameplay! I didn't feel so moved by No Man's Sky's worlds.

Space has no verisimilitude. There's no gravity, except when your boots are actually on the ground. You don't orbit a planet. You don't need to think about your path through a solar system. You just point your ship at where you want to go, press a button, and you're instantly there. There are no gas giants, or anything other than terrestrial worlds. Our own solar system could not be modeled in NMS.

Base-building. Don't get me wrong, I love base-building games. But this isn't supposed to be a base-building game; it's supposed to be a space exploration game. The goal of the game (to reach the center of the galaxy) is directly opposed to base-building. 

In fact, when playing the game, and seeing how fully featured ancillary features like base-building, creature taming, and space-suit customization were, I found myself feeling that they'd sunk all their development time in the wrong things. No Man's Sky feels like it's being led by something other than it's listed design goals.

--

Conclusion: For me, I found myself falling asleep playing it. I don't hate sandboxes by any means, but this just lacked enough of a challenge or narrative for me to sink my teeth into.

All that said, this game really is incredible, technically. One wonders what they could do to bring a gamer like me on board. I love survival sandboxes like Oxygen Not Included; I love builder games like Subnautica or Factorio; I love games about space, like Stellaris. I'm in the developer's wheelhouse. Just...

  Things I like:
1. Once I got a hang of the game it is pretty easy to progress.
2.  The different types of worlds and the endless amount of them.
3.  There are different paths to follow in story
4. Many ships to choose from
  Things I think need improvement:
1. Frigate missions are very limited. I don't think there should be a timer on them refreshing. I enjoy doing them, but have to wait 24 hours and can only do 5.
2. I also enjoy running my settlement. It is also a little slow. I can build something and then I have to wait for the settlement to decide what to do next. If I am the overseer I should just be able to do it myself.
3. I find NPC's in floors pretty often. So, there are some bugs. However nothing that makes the game unplayable.

Yes another update since my last post 4 years ago, there has been a TON of stuff added and more interesting things to do now, not to mention that while I wouldn't play the entire game in VR it still is a pretty cool VR experience with decent controls for VR, I would say that with how much it has evolved over 7 years that it is well worth the $60 asking price at this point, heck it probably was 2 years ago but I had kind of forgot about it between Dec 2019 until June this year because my Steam catalog is just way to hard to remember all the games I want to go back to from time to time.

UPDATE #2 (Dec 2019)
This game is still seeing major updates and new features and is an entirely different game from that garbage state it was released in. Compared to my last update where I said that it wasn't worth $60, maybe 40. I am going to change that slightly with how much has changed since then. Is it worth 
$60? Previous No; Now Maybe,
$40? Previously Eh maybe; Now Probably
$30?Previously Probably; Now Almost certainly 
$20? Previously Definitly; Now No change.

The game came out in a terrible state but now has been worked on above and beyond their original promises that they failed to deliever originally.. 

UPDATE #1 (some time early 2018) 

This game launched as a buggy unfinished mess, with a lot of lacking promised features or fake ones. But since then it has been three years and a lot of updates, new features, and fixes have been done, even to the point where a new major patch with a lot of content added will come out here in the next week even though the game is 3 years old at this point. I would honestly say while the game is still very grindy, if you find the game on sale, it might be worth looking into since the poor reviews mostly comes from people who bought it at launch, hated the state it came out in and never gave it another go since. Is it worth $60? No; $40? Eh maybe; $30? Probably; $20 definitly; If Steam had an option to filter out reviews by date to get more accurate representation I would say look at reviews from the last 6 months and not ones from 3 years ago, there has been vast updates and fixes, but since they don't just realize that 52% is from people who got a lot of hype and then got something launched years to early and then never came back when the game was more feature complete. Initial Load times are a little long but once you are in the game the far and few between load times (only when you switch galaxies) are not bad.

#####Original review##### (August 2016)
Has a lot of performance issues for a lot of people, while my performance isn't what it should be I am lucky and it is atleast a playable performance for me. Hopefully the issues for most people will get fixed sooner rather then later but it seems to be 50/50 as to wither or not you get a playable experience or unbearable framerate issues and for that reason alone I would say wait for them to fix it or wait till its on deep discount because you shouldn't be rewarding devs when they release something not fit for purpose for half their consumers.

With that out of the way lets get to is the game good or not and wither or not I would recommend it after it gets some fixes. I feel this game is very much like Spore where most people will be disapointed it didn't live up to its hype and for people who didn't listen to hype it will depend on if you like games that would be best described as Elite Dangerous crossed with Rodina crossed with the survival genre of having to constantly be gathering tons of resources to craft into things, that has a ""Inventory Full Simulator 2016"" feel to it as well where you have very little inventory but in the few places you can sell stuff most of what you have you need to craft things so end up either selling stuff you need hoping its common enough to find again, skiping looting, or constantly flying back and forth between the vendor and where your exploring, mixed with the Final Fantasy X ""find all the words for each language throughout the game to figure out what gibberish they where speaking the first time you encountered them"" (yes I know in FFX that it was 26 letters hidden around the game and not hundreds or thousands of words, but still point is having to find a way to translate the language they are speaking right in the begining)

All in all I am enjoying the game, but I also enjoy games like Elite Dangerous, Rodina, and I didn't find Spore to be that bad (sure it wasn't that good either, but it wasn't that bad), its got the beautiful exploration of Rodina mixed with the Elite Dangerous ""well I can sell it hear but I will get 20% less money then if I sell it 3 systems over, but it costs resources to fly those 3 systems so do I really make a profit flying that far?"" mixed with finding all the words to be able to get what the alien races are telling you. Its a niche game (not as niche as ED, but still definitly not for everyone) that if you don't like exploring in games, if you have to have something to do you will not enjoy this game, but if you like exploring everything with very little to no main objective to head towards (that you are aware of) then you will love the game.

The upgrade system is interesting, though it is annoying perks like sprinting take up inventory slots which you start off thread bear with anyways. The constantly having to recharge things as often as you do feels like survival game crap that while things should need recharged you shouldn't need to do them near as often as you do.

My biggest gripe with the game is that while the wild life is pretty cool when you come across it, the planets seem way to barren, you can explore a planet for an hour and only run into one creature, I don't expect the planets to be sprawling with creatures, but I would like there to be enough to where you can not go 30 miutes without seeing any lifeforms at all, atleast enough to where you see atleast one other living thing once every 10 miuntes to make the planets feel less barren.

THE GAME JUST RESTARTS!! hahahah! Remember one of Seans many lies about how people will want to go to the center? Well, those poor suckers that kept playing to find out were left even more disappointed in the end. 

I would recommend this game at a $20-$25 price range. $60 is a fucking ridiculous asking price.  Also, the reviews would be much lower but STEAM REMOVES NEGATIVE REVIEWS AFTER REFUND.  Just a heads up, think about that one.

Edit #3:

It's really cool that they actually finished their game (let's relax and stop giving them too much credit for delivering what was promised (years after))

-----------------------------------

I've tried to get in to this game four separate times since buying it. Each time, it was after hearing someone say ""Oh yeah, that game really did get good after a while, you should check it out again."" Each time, I have the exact same thoughts - the game is boring. Almost indescribably boring. It actually puts me to sleep. 

That could be good if you really want a ""chill"" game, but to me it only feels ""chill"" because it's literally nothing. I'm not DOING anything. The only reason I go anywhere (outside of the occasional randomly generated building with a static npc in it) is just to be burdened with the process of going there in the first place. 

Taking off and leaving orbit requires fuel, and jumping to another system requires a different fuel. Landing and getting out shows you pretty much the entire planet right away; the terrain and flora/fauna are mostly the same outside of the occasional cave or sea. The entire planet has the same weather.  There may be a hut or two somewhere you can trade with a minecraft villager at, if you're lucky. Aside from that, the only reason I even have to get out is to get more fuel for my thrusters. While I'm out, my life support systems start complaining about needing more fuel, too. After punching every tree, rock, crystal and randomly generated spore creature in eyesight of the ship and stuffing it in to the status bars shackled to my ankles, I get back in my ship and take off, having accomplished nothing except knowing the Gek word for ""stupid.""

The actual spaceflight stuff is nice, although it's not exactly sim-y. Pretty simple and basic. The incremental tech upgrades to your ship(s), suit and laser tool are probably supposed to be the main source of progression and a reason to keep going, but that's not helped by how tedious the menus are to navigate, especially on a gamepad. Tedious just feels like the word here. 

Even if I can go out there and build a big compound or run my own frigate or discover that we're all in a simulation or whatever, I can't shake that feeling that when I head out towards to a new planet, there's not really anything to do or anything to discover unless I'm doing it just to inconvenience myself.",1665790941,1702347452,True,0,0,0.664603650569915771,9,True,False,False

You will not be able to get a good idea of the game within the 2 hour refund period, and they will reject your refund for being longer. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are 100% sure you will like the game.

In addition:
- lots of bugs, many of which softlock or hardlock the game
- all procgen feels very repetitive once you've seen like 20 of each thing
- all the buildings are identical, feeling even more repetitive
- they tried to shoehorn in a story which feels very disconnected and antithetical to the game's design
- tutorial takes forever, far longer than your 2 hour return period
- everything is locked behind the tutorial for some reason
- cant customize your ship despite it being made of modular parts. you cant even paint it.
- every single task in this game boils down to collecting materials, which is a huge grind
- sentinals act like gta cops, and since they just keep coming, your only option is to hide, which is extremely annoying, especially if you're in space, and they can be triggered by anything
- every planet looks the same all over, once you've landed, you've essentially seen the whole planet
- there are 0 towns or cities, just repetitive buildings
- building could be fun, if it there were more decorative blocks, but there's only like one variation of everything
- $60 is way too much for this game, it should start at $30 (which they put it on sale for constantly, so they know that's the real price). but I still think $30 was too much. I'd be happy if I paid $15.

I'm not one of the players who played during their disastrous launch, so I can't say how much it's improved. But I did play around 4 years ago, and it still feels pretty much exactly the same. I'm sure people who already own it are happy to get free updates, but the game still feels like it isn't complete. I think even if this version was what they launched with, people would be upset. I wish they focused more on refining the features they already have and fixing the gamebreaking bugs instead of adding new fancy features.

Its so cool to see how this game evolved since 2016. I played it when it came out on ps4, and I can safely say its much better than it was.
I got this game again because the new content looked really fun, but that's where my main problem with this game comes up for me. To do the cool new content (i.e. the new robot race/getting a cool staff) you have to do honest to god what feels like 30,000 hours of the worst and most boring main story quest chain I think I have ever played in a video game. It basically boils down to 

Go here

Talk to this guy

Go back to the transmitter

get this item

Go back

Rinse and repeat.

It seems a little misleading to give players access to new content this way. I thought I'd be able to at least buy a game and experience the new stuff when I buy it.

But that's really where my gripes end. All that stuff aside this game is a great space exploration sandbox that gives you a lot of neat tools to do whatever you want. Piracy is really fun. Commanding a fleet of starships is cool. The ship combat and base building is also really satisfying. If you're willing to play for a while to get access to all the cool stuff then this game is for you. If you don't care about all that stuff and just want a really chill space exploration game, this is a must buy.

- Alot of glitches around. Duplicating glicth is crazy easy and OP. 
- No Challenge. Everything easy. But need to be grind.
- No acomplishment feeling. Nothing has value. 
- Building mechanics, blocks and snapping are dumb. 
- Too many bad RNG happening. 
- After completing main quests nothing to do except daily quests. If you find yourself making circles somewhere you should know that game is wasting your time. And this game waste alot of your time for nothing.

This is a great game. The creators have done a great job updating it, and making it something worth your time IF you enjoy exploration, building, and missions. I've only put about 110 hours into this over the past year, but I'd say it is well worth the money and time.

No regrets. I look forward to their future updates.

Play with friends? Sure! To accomplish what, exactly? More nothing.

I've played both flat and VR, the game looks fine. The UI is almost OK in both, but not really. I'm having trouble remembering anything of note because none of it matters at all. Theres also no creativity on your part really, because youre in their sandbox, so you cant even really play lego.

Instead of 'playing' these games, go learn C#, or hit a gym if you are looking for a huge time sink that will actually help your life in a way sandbox games never can.

if you order a hot dog, and it took 5 years for the vendor to give you the bun that you expected, but tthe hotdog still ended up tasting like shit anyway, it doesnt deserve praise. its not that ""they fixed it!"", its that ""they just finally made it"". FIX would mean that all of the shitty game design and game breaking bugs this game have would be absent now. all that happened is that they shit in our mouths and say sorry after.

its been what? 4? 5? 7 years? and still the most notorious bug, that is easily triggered, and will softlock the game, possibly making you loose 1 hour of progress ARE STILL PRESENT in the game. OH BUT ITS OKAY THO BECAUSE YOU CAN NOW MILK SOME ALIEN FUCKING TITTIES! SUCK SUCK MOTHER FUCKER! YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM DELICIOSO! 

this is coming from me, im one of those people who played a lot of buggy ass games, like skyrim, but somehow rarely encounter them (especially the game breaking ones). i had to watch youtube videos to know what the fuck are the bugs people talking about in a game. but not with this game, oh no, i've encountered the same progress breaking bug 5 times now. 

and yeah, im code illiterate, but im not a dumb fuck, i know that if a game breaking bug like that is present, and there's no technical way to fix it, then they should've been fixed from a design standpoint. let us open the build menu on the nexus and space station, or better yet, just make the game save EVERYTIME we talk to some dumb aliens who's unfortunate enough to be named sucky mcgoo bin fucky mcbang or some shit. that way, WHEN people like me who couldn't care less for cringy ass dialogues in a game where the story barely matters, try to skip those cringy dialogues, we aren't force to see fuck bitch mcfucker face while the game softlocks, and all that shit we did to scan a planet wouldn't be for jack fuck

""hey im jackshit dumbo mcfuckface, i make the nexus quests, and you know what, im gonna force the player to finish it in one session, so it'll look cool. whats that? a softlocking bug where if you talk to an npc, the dialogue might not show up, and you're force to closed out the game? i dont care, im jackfuck dumshit mcdumbdumb, i just design games for the vibes, and will only use my thinking brain when there's a viral outrage, im dumbo bitchington wellington III from hello games, and have fun spending 15 of your 30 hours doing the same shit over and over again because we dont have a competent game designer""",1702205946,1702205946,False,0,2,0.336208373308181763,0,True,False,False

This is my story of the game.
I discovered the game in late 2019, right after the launch of the Beyond update. I had very little access to gaming news back then (so I had no idea about the controversial launch), I had very little experience with many open world games in the past, the only exception being Minecraft. So when I went to my grandparent's house (they have an XBOX 1) and got to test it out, my mind was completely blown. Never in my life had I even imagined it possible to have a game that contained a literal universe that I could travel seamlessly!
Of course, the game immediately went on my christmas list. My parents bought it for me on the PS4, and I played the crap out of it. For months, it was exclusively the game that I played with little exception. I was enthralled by the universe, and exploring it was a dream come true.
I loved building empires, getting ships, finding weird planets no one had ever seen before! It was something truly special.
The thing that really got me was the updates. Oh My Gosh. I thought the game was amazing when I was playing it back then. But then huge update after update released. I clearly remember learning about Living Ship and thinking ""This can't be real"". Exo mech came out, and while it wasn't as spicy, it was still cool. Then there was Desolation, which was incredible! 

Soon, I got my first PC. After a few months, I decided to get No Man's Sky on steam. So, I purchased it one night, woke up the next morning, and Origins dropped. Origins was one of the best updates to ever come to the game in my opinion, and to say the least I was stoked.

While I don't play the game consistently, it is one of those ones I can always come back to. I recently have played 10-20 hours every year, and it's great. Last year, I played the game, and I got to get myself a then new solar ship, play around with sentinels, etc. This year I came back to the same save and got to get a sentinel interceptor, and got to enjoy the incredible Echoes update. Every year, there is a massive amount of content added, and it is truly a blessing and a testament to the legendary comeback this game had.

with that out of the way, here are some pros and cons:
PROS
-Updates
-SEAMLESS SPACE TRAVEL ITS SO GOOD
-Base Building. That's always great to see in a game
-Graphics/artstyle
-Soundtrack. Could be swapped with Risk of Rain's and no one would notice *HYPERBOLE*
-Story and lore---OMG it may not be on the level as stories in like the Ori Games or Hollow Knight, it is surprisingly good. Like I came back to it after like 2 years fully expecting it to be not as good as I remembered, but I was quickly proven wrong 9/10 story
-gek

Cons:
-The procedural generation is, inevitably, limited.
-that grind... This game has hours of content, which is good, but sometimes it feels soooooo grindy
-The multiplayer is great, but somewhat limited. The universe is not perfectly consistent between players, so dont expect to be building cool shared bases with your buddies that you can both edit offline :(

is it just because hello games have continued pushing out half-baked content updates?

You see, hello games has a very strange strategy to game design, namely they don't fix bugs, they label them as features and call it a day.
Well, that's not entirely true, they do sometimes ""fix"" bugs, but they appear to look for the worst way possible to do so.

Star ship mining laser overheats so fast that it's not usable for mining?
Call it a phase gun and pretend the overheating is intended!

People abuse bash-flying to get around planets too fast? just reduce jetpack fuel by 95%, it does nothing to fix bash-flying, but at least it'll be more annoying to do.

People complain the game is too easy? 
make a hard mode where every planet is deadly, so being exposed to the elements kills you in about 5 minutes.
and spawn the player a 10 minute walk away from their ship every time they die.

Clipping into space stations when you make a sharp turn as you boost into the landing animation?
let's just not let you turn the starship when boosting, does nothing to fix the floppy pathing that is the root cause of the clipping issue, but it makes it harder to do (it also completely ruins space combat, but we'll ignore that)
https://twitter.com/siriusblack9999/status/1731756310163775763

Freighter telepad softlocks you if you try to hover over because it teleports you to the same position relative to the destination, which happens to be inside the wall above the destination telepad?
don't fix the fact that you're softlocked when you end up in a wall because wall hitboxes are two-sided
don't fix the fact that teleports don't autosave, so you can spend literal hours playing without ever autosaving if you teleport between locations
don't add a way to un-softlock yourself (EDIT: turns out i didn't check the options menu well enough, because sure enough, there actually is an unstuck button!, too bad it only works on freighters)
don't fix the relative positional offset in the teleporting that causes this particular softlock
naah, cause those fixes would make sense, hello games style is to just shrink the teleport hitbox and call it good, never mind that the ""biological horror"" creatures that were introduced in 2018 also have a habit of pushing you into walls, softlocking you, which still hasn't been addressed.
https://twitter.com/siriusblack9999/status/1732550287087550727

And don't get me started about the shitstorm that is sentinels... at least they've finally been somewhat buffed, so it's no longer 5 waves of 1-3 enemies per wave, followed by ""oops, we didn't think anyone would make it this far, now no more sentinels will ever spawn as long as you stay on this planet"".
But they're still completely and utterly broken.
If you aggro sentinels, then sit in your spaceship and do nothing, after 30 seconds, you'll get 2 stars
30 seconds later 3 stars, 30 seconds later 4, 30 seconds more 5 stars, and if you then get out, they de-aggro entirely
https://twitter.com/siriusblack9999/status/1731822518930227210
they forget you exist when you're standing inside a building, even if you're actively shooting them
https://twitter.com/siriusblack9999/status/1732097526101311922
and shooting a space station gets you 3 stars instantly, but landing in a space station de-aggros and despawns them (useful for farming freighters)

oh, and they thought a virtual joystick would be a good control scheme for VR
no, not the joystick on the VR controllers,
you use the VR controllers to grab a virtual joystick, and moving that virtual joystick then controls the ship with zero feedback at all, so you better have a steady hand or you're going to start doing backflips in VR, great for people with motion sickness.",1701984415,1702060305,False,6,3,0.492511004209518433,2,True,False,False

As a dedicated player since its early days, I've witnessed the game's evolution, and I am truly astounded by the commitment of the developers at Hello Games to continually improve and expand upon their universe.

The sheer scale of No Man's Sky is mind-boggling. From the moment you step onto your first procedural generated planet, you are immersed in a breathtaking, diverse cosmos. The sense of discovery is unparalleled, as each star system brings new wonders, unique landscapes, and a wealth of flora and fauna waiting to be catalogued. The exploration aspect alone is worth the journey, and the recent updates have only deepened the well of possibilities.

Beyond exploration, No Man's Sky now boasts a robust multiplayer experience, allowing players to seamlessly connect with others across the galaxy. The addition of multiplayer not only enhances the cooperative aspects of the game but also introduces a social dimension that enriches the overall experience. Teaming up with fellow interlopers to embark on epic space adventures adds a whole new layer of excitement and camaraderie.

The crafting and base-building mechanics have also seen significant improvements. Building your own planetary outpost or constructing a massive freighter fleet has never been more intuitive or rewarding. The customisation options are vast, allowing players to truly leave their mark on the universe in creative and unique ways.

One of the most commendable aspects of No Man's Sky is the dedication to community feedback. Hello Games actively listens to its player base, addressing concerns and implementing changes based on user suggestions. This commitment to improvement has fostered a strong and supportive community that feels genuinely valued by the developers.

In conclusion, No Man's Sky is no longer just a game; it's an ongoing cosmic adventure that continues to evolve and captivate. The dedication of Hello Games to their creation is evident in every update, and the result is a space-faring experience that is as boundless and awe-inspiring as the universe it seeks to emulate.

A game deserving the ""Labor of Love"" award.  It is not without its flaws, but overall I recommend this game.

This review has been edited twice now; As of December 2023, I am ""up to date"" and have generally played the game through twice.  My overall opinion hasn't changed since the second review edit, so I'll leave it below. 

Short version, it's well worth a single play through at the on-sale price point it regularly goes on.  I've bought the game twice for my family.  If we had a 3rd PC, I'd get a 3rd copy so we could all play at once.

It's just plain fun.  The core game is quite simple, there are a lot of things you can do at any given time depending on your mood, and to appeal to a wider variety of players. In my case, one daughter likes to just go exploring and finding new creatures/planets.  Another just plants in place and starts base building...while Daddy's out in space blasting pirates. 

Patches continually add new things that add new spins or overall TLC to the game.  While there is still room for improvement, I have revised my review and expect it will eventually get a solid 10/10 in the future.

The bad:

1) The game lacks cohesion:

Having completed the game, I enjoyed it overall, but I think it might be better to rework existing things to better mesh into a longer overall story.  Or to not progress certain main story elements until certain related parts are done.  As is, you just go from place to place without really integrating all elements. 

As is, there's really no reason to have certain upgrades because there's really no gate or progression between them.  Hyperdrives for example: As soon as you get one, warp to the newly unlocked star type, mine the next mineral up, upgrade to the next hyperdrive, rinse repeat to max.  

It should be using additional components that are more involved: Rare resources that require planetary searches, underwater-only resources, materials gained only from fighting the menacing machine/""horror"" enemies or something you get from derelict freighters in space).  Something like storm crystals are an excellent example of how they ""Gatekeep"" in that you have to have a good handle/patience on surviving in hostile storms to get them. 

2) It can get repetitive quickly:

My biggest issue now is  how uniform planets are overall.  I hope we can eventually see worlds reworked to have multiple biomes on a single planet, and for more general points of interest or pull to just exploring an individual planet.  Essentially I would love to see a player be able to spend their entire play on a single planet and continuously enjoy new experiences.  As an example, other sandbox games like Conan Exiles show how a world can have a lot packed into a small space.  Of course, that game is a handcrafted world and not procedural, but it's a good goal.  Things like enemy humanoid encampments or ruined cities would be interesting.

Similarly, there is a need for more creature types, more variety in parts and ideally more alien races, even if they are merely minor.

3) A lot of options that don't REALLY matter:

The different exo-craft, space ships etc ultimately are just aesthetic choices.  There really should be a more obvious cap or difference between things like cargo space, speed or maneuverability.

Things like the shuttles being efficient for fuel/launch fuel, ultimately being the ONLY option for free takeoff would be interesting.  Or having fighters have pitiful cargo max space, or the inability to have a warp drive...but also an inherent bonus to all weapon mods.  As is they are all essentially identical.


The Verdict: 
With as much love as this game has, I'm confident any problems will be ironed out, and perhaps the core story/progression loop might get a TLC.  A solid game but still needs a little more love.

Then there are nice fights with the big pirate  capital ships or   the lil Pirate ones ( fighting lil ones when they only appear gives you the chance for a freighter )  .. i prefer the large one grins as you get awesome stuff for your own  freighter ( which is free if its your first claimed one so dont jump to get the first one unless its decent B or preferential an A or even S class ) but deffo  get one over time lol and some decent frigates especially  to  put the overseer on the main ship  and such ... and yes do take  on the first game the time  to do  some standard but also some unusual Base  Building ... your imagination is your only  hurdle giggles there is  fantastic outfits to be gotten too both from Quests and from Expeditions.
Also sending out your frigates  brings you  decent stuff incl upgrades for your ship and  your freighter etc as do the Quests given at Space Stations too  .. yes  sometimes it can be a bit grindy in bits but that's mainly at the beginning when you not know much lol - see you there --> yes you CAN play together with your Friends  visit each others bases and capital ships  travel with them too on the big ship and it can be fun to  kick some serious butt  - YOU CAN BUT DO NOT HAVE TO PVP - one of many reason i like this game !!  Also you can find damaged ships and either part repair n squish them at space stations or if they nice repair them fully and use them instead of the one you have at the start LOL - Go Have fun its  not an expensive game especially not when on sale - winks OOHH and its multi platform !!!

Though I only have a few dozen hours on steam as of writing this, on Xbox I have hundreds upon hundreds of hours spent in this masterpiece. I was there at the beginning of it all, in 2016, No Man's Sky was only a concept, one small step. But I've watched the game grow and become something so unrecognizable from the launch. It has become one of if not my favorite open-world game, and I find myself constantly returning to it, if not grinding it. The music, the atmosphere, the U.I., the lore, and the game-play, all concocted into something absolutely intoxicating. The developers have mastered their design, and seeing it constantly improve and seeing the endless, empty galaxy be filled with life, is something beautiful. 

Even in my career as an aspiring astronautical engineer, No Man's Sky is almost solely responsible for creating my dream to invent magnificent machines that can take me to the stars. Much of my designs are inspired from this very game. So I can not adequately thank these developers enough for making something so breathtaking.

1. Combat and specifically gun shooting can elevate to a level of games like Destiny 2.
2. not sure if possible to be done, but... physics to every physical body in game, including forces like gravity to building parts, small rocks flying around as caused by strong winds and more.

The procedurally generated universe is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's vast, awe-inspiring, and practically infinite. On the other, it occasionally serves up planets that make you question the sanity of your spacefaring alter ego. But hey, that's the charm, right? The freedom to explore, build, and shape your own narrative is a major draw. Base building is a welcome addition, giving you a reason to claim your slice of the cosmic pie.

The multiplayer aspect breathes life into the galaxy. Teaming up with friends or encountering strangers adds a social layer that was sorely missed at launch. And let's not forget the ongoing commitment to improvement.

The game poses very little challenge (""Min-max"" is not needed to thrive and ""grinding"" would reward only convenience but not progress) also it provides no meaningful experience (Most quests revolves around ""go and fetch"" since they are generated randomly). Although, the game could be tricky in some aspects such as refining system which no hints given whatsoever or such as adjacency bonus for modules placement.

Story and NPC behavior: The main story is linear and decent. It covers deep theme but somehow the storytelling just couldn't cover its complexity content. It's worse for the side story since most of them are only texts (at least show pictures or something). I still fail to see relationship between individuals in those 18 quintillion planets (I barely visited around hundred of planets within 10 galaxies & I don't expect to see difference in other place). For example, individuals live in one star system show no connection whatsoever to the individuals lives in nearby star systems. Heck! Even individuals live in same star system have very little interaction to each other. FeelsSoullessMan.

Combat: Could be overwhelming if you are not prepared, but once you're good then nothing's threat.

Survival: This one I find very fun because it involves your knowledge about the NMS universe.

Exploration: 10/10 Eye-opening, but expect natural formations instead of handmade structures. I still hope they put grand waterfalls somewhere in the universe. :(

Base building: It has satisfying snapping points (Few can be irritating to placed) for main structures but very limited to available stuff given by dev unless you use glitch such as wire glitch and other shenanigans like expanding base radius from 600u max radius to 2000u max radius then the creativity become infinity.

Management: Very basic without delegation of authority. I find it annoying because the player need to do everything just like Fallout 4 settlement once again.

Roleplay: IMHO, it's very weak because NPCs have limited interaction with the player and the barrier to be anything you want in game is very low thus not meaningful.

Multiplayer: It's functional but since you can (and would) do everything by yourself, it becomes questionable for my taste. Still, you can meet other players and interact with them with words or gestures even doing missions together.

Overall, if you have 100+ hours to spend (You can at least experience everything given by the game once). Get NMS for amazing visual experience, it's really eye-opening.

Below is original review. 

The game has come a long way from when it first released. Today it is a very complete game with more than enough stuff to do for almost any player. 

Flying ships is good, simple but effective. 
Flight combat is simple, almost to simple. Flight combat is waaaay to simple. No where near enough ships, style of fights and tactics to justify the number of weapon systems. I am not expecting Elite Dangerous or Eve Online. However something more here would go along way in the future. Right now it is just serviceable. 

Ground exploration has an EXTRMELY good loop. It is a very simple loop but extremely effective. fight something, scan, move on, explore. 

The variety in planets is pretty extensive, you see patters over time but they did a great job at making things different enough to where you dont feel like its the same planet, at least so far not one has been quite the same, even if it is the same type. 

The game feels like an overly simplistic version of what Star Citizen wants to be. The difference being No Man's Sky exists today and is fully playable (some bugs abound) and is an honestly great game now. To my knowledge there are no plans to stop making it better.  So the best could be yet to come.",1658785219,1701876776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is beautiful. Just land on a lush planet and stand in the grass and take it all in. Then jump in your spacecraft and go star hopping. Find the perfect balance of economy/resources/beauty in a solar system and build a base on land or water if you choose. Upgrade all of your equipment to S. Play with your friends. Ride animals around a planet while you farm resources.  I have to say that I have enjoyed everything but my favorite part of this game is the soundtrack... The music in this game is a masterpiece plain and simple. Every time I log on it seems like I hear different music or a different take on previous songs. It is vast and so so good. From the drum and bass when you are fighting a sentinel to the piano piece that I first fell in love with, this soundtrack is far above so many other games. I know they have glitches. I lost a freighter and a base myself. I had to have a little patience at the start but they kept releasing updates. They keep working and it looks like they really care about this game. Just catch a sell and spend 29 dollars. 

SO, I can recommend this game. 
Soundtrack  10/10!!!

Technical  5/10

Overall  7/10

Update. 
 
I just want to add that all of the updates since this review have done nothing but make the game far more enjoyable. I am still in love with the soundtrack and the overall beauty of the landscapes on planets.  I have been farming activated Indium and have billions of credits. I am very pleased to see that the latest reviews are very positive. Hopefully they will overtake the ratio of early bad reviews and the overall tag will be positive. Please, please, please buy this game. A true gem that I feel will be talked about for many future generations. 

Edit 12/05/2023
I was just wanting to come back here and add to the ever-growing saga which is NMS. The game which is always getting updated and asking nothing in return. I came here to give my take on the Starfield vs NMS debate.  NMS did not ask to get thrown in with Starfield. They existed well before the game and will well after. If anything the comparison has helped NMS because it easily shows its strengths lol. I really wanted to like Starfield but wow did that not happen. Such a missed opportunity. 

Buy NMS. You will thank me later.",1566838565,1701799399,True,1,0,0.501123189926147461,0,True,False,False

The solution to this [b]MAIN STORY QUESTLINE ROADBLOCK BUG[/b]: Use the construction research terminal in your base instead of the one on the space anomaly and the quest trigger will proceed as normal and you may speak to Nada to continue the game.

Despite the quest log explicitly saying 'Use the Construction Research Station' you simply do not do that and do something completely different. Bravo
Hopefully this review shows up on search results for The Space Anomaly quest bug helps someone stuck like I was. Drop me a jester if it works.



[Old Review]
Trying to proceed with the main questline hits a roadblock in the space anomaly where I am required to purchase a construction blueprint. Purchasing a blueprint doesn't proceed the quest.
After searching this quest bug has been in the game for 4 years minimum and is still an issue, with amazing workarounds like 'restart the game' and 'press left click instead of the right click prompt' or 'do something else for awhile' not working I am still unable to progress.

Fighting goes like this:
-  any dog fighting consists of pressing a button and auto-locking onto a target to kill.
-  using mouse is bugged and doesn't work properly
-  you can turn on a dime or stop (shouldn't work like that in space)
-  you cannot escape sentinels (just quit and rejoin)

Resources:
-  gathering money is simple, yet tedious and a waste of time.
-  repetitive
-  you'll see 80% of the content after scanning and running around for a while
-  dig a hole, for Rock and STONE, go to the next deposit, dig a hole
-  it's a pain in the butt when you're missing a simple resource which causes you to waste 30 minutes to do a simple ""rinse and repeat""
-  missions are also ""rinse and repeat""

To keep a solid player-base, this game will need to come up with some hardcore overhauls. The controls and events just aren't up to the standards of good indie games of 2023.

A... — Today at 11:38 AM
It's more fun and has more complete features than elite dangerous and star citizen put together. I have thousands of hours in each.
Very intuitive controls. Easy to learn. I don't think I've had to look anything up except one desynching bug which was easily and reliably remedied.
I was playing with a 6 year old yesterday, streaming and he was teaching me how to do stuff in the game. There is depth to it as well. It reminds me the most of like what a good empyrion wanted to be.
A... — Today at 11:47 AM
My only complaint so far would be that my thrustmaster hotas and throttle don't automatically plug and play with it. One has to program them or use a template through steam default controls which is tedious and nnot intuitive imo. 

But I don't really have a need for it since the flying is so smooth with the mouse and keyboard. In star citizen and Elite Dangerous, I use my hotas to fly and pull manuevers, and switch to mouse for fine aiming, ect. 

With no man's sky, there is no sideways or vertical thrust so it just flies wheere you point it. Not so much simulation style but more arcadey and turns out it's more fun. A lot of tedium has but cut out or streamlined such as LANDINGS; which are as simple as pressing and holding down the E button  anywhere you want.
I always blow up in other games, lol and I've actually co-piloted light aircraft.
So like, I know how to fly.]

well shit uve sold me, does it randomly generate different planets and universes? I remember when it was announced it was supposed to be similar to Spore in that sense
A... — Today at 11:55 AM
256 galaxies...15 quintillion systems/planets?
like 20ish base biomes with hundreds/thousands? of variations
It's all procedurally generated, one universe that everyone shares. When Glo and I spawned, we were the first ones to discover all the planets in the system, the animals, the fauna, everything but some guy on x-box discovered the system 7 years ago and since then wee are thee first to see it.
You can teleport to your friends, lol
So, since we discovered the planets and lifeforms and stuff we got to name them whatever we wanted and it says wee discovered it, says the name wee named them when you look at them, and the date they were discovered. 

There is specific teech for underwater vehicles and bases, land vehicles, ect. You can fly together in huge carrier ships and launch your npc fighter squadron or your own fighter ship from it, ect.
no loading screens unless you teleeport
then is like a wormhole thingy, but in space, atmosphere, everything is basically seemless.
oh yeah. You can have squadrons of npc fighters that follow you around and wreck shit for you
A... — Today at 12:02 PM
There's also a ton of ships I had no idea about that all look differeent, huge haulers, freighters, ect.
solar ships, a buncha super rare ships to find and hunt for as well as a lot of other completionist activites and items to work towards.
There is also hubs where people gather and you can trade and whatnot.
some pretty cool character customization too. can dye any color you want, doesn't cost any money in game or out to change your race, clothing, whatever.
any time you want
every expansion has been free for the last 7 years and they do one a year
And they still selling the game at full price, ($60) after seven years. I got two copies.
But yeah, it reminded me a lot of spore, empyrion, elite dangerous, all mixxed together with a splash of what star citizen is like when it actually works correctly. lol
Spore cause you can terrraform EVERYTHING.
A... — Today at 12:10 PM
And it's cool, like tthe game doesn't punish you like a lot of other games do with tedium as a, ""feature.""  There is weather, you gotta eat, recharge life support, hazard shielding, ect.

More than just hot and cold, Day and night, there are fire storms, toxic storms, all kinds of storms, hostile plantlife, underground biomes, underwater biomes.....There's a lot to the game and that's just all the stuff I've done in the last day or so.
You can make your own racetrack courses and race friends with live ammo.....
and run into randoms and pvp with them
It's opt in
There's a whole expansion about being a pirate/outlaw.
and you can tame every animal you find.
and you can ride them.
some of them fly

This basically meant that I got to walk in with an open mind, unmarred by the game's past. And I have to say, I have really enjoyed my time. 

The first thing to note is that yes, while the game does have a story and missions, this is ultimately a sandbox first and foremost. If you do not enjoy games that give very little to no direction, then you will dislike the game once you finish up the story. If you don't mind the sandbox though, there is quite a lot to do. There are a lot of interesting planets to visit and creatures to discover and tame, quite a few ways to get some action and combat, you can get a capital ship and completely forget about building a regular base, making a mobile station instead, or you can help build a settlement and manage it over time, as it continues to generate revenue for you. There are daily and weekly missions that I myself don't engage with that often, but some of them are pretty fun. There is just a lot to do, if it tickles your fancy.

And with active game developers, constant updates and free DLC's makes this game worth it if your willing to put in some time.

Overall, I think the game is enjoyable and I wish it was functionally better made and possibly better thought out from beginning to end. At this point, I think the game was piece mealed.

Issues: 
Bluetooth Controller Disconnects- This from what I've been seeing is a wide spread, long term issue. I'm using a Xbox controller and it works fine for about a day (6 hours approx Total Game time). Than after that it will do what everyone says and disconnect repeatedly. This is in and out of active use. So I can be in combat and the controller will DC for 1-3 seconds or I could be on the phone. This is not acceptable in the modern age of gaming where Bluetooth compatibility is normal. Their should also be a warning if the case that BT isn't possible for controllers to curb any player issues at this point since the concern is 2 years old at least.

Aiming- The ability to aim in certain situations can get you killed and be a complete pain in the a$ $. It's usually in water, steep hills or when the camera takes a sharp first person zoom due to terrain shifts. During combat this can turn your health to zero if your not in open territory, constantly moving. If you stand still for a second, and get caught by a terrain shift or on a mountain range? The aiming has a big chance to screw up and blind you. 
In water, you simply can't look all the way up. So how you swim is how your view is and that doesn't change even when you stop. So your eyes technically always look forward and upward view is always limited by comparison to lower. Doesn't make sense when you come to a complete stop in water and try to look up or stand on the shore and are supposed to have full upward view. Another words, building in the water is minimum annoying and for me, rage quit frustrating. 

Conclusion (if you got this far)- The Exploration, mining, characters and story are my favorite aspects, but the combat, controller support, and technical support behind the game are just bad. It seems like the game was built for Consoles and we got what was left on PC.",1701567583,1701567583,False,1,1,0.503162860870361328,0,True,False,False

I've no idea how the game was before ( yes, I saw the vids in u2b ), but now, it def worth buying and playing.

Linux users, don't worry, game runs like a charm with Proton Experimental (I'm currently runing the game with it, and it works. Tested out 8.* also -> no problems as well ). So big thank you to VALVE !

System used : Lenovo T14 Gen3 AMD Ryzen 5 Pro ( Integrated 680AMD GPU ) with 16 gigs LPDDR5
Ingame scaling  is on 60% ( to avoid internal action and menu lags ) -> works perfect & smooth for me, no hickups, no tearing, no problems ( even inside the anomaly station ).
Res used : 1920x1200 borderless ( full screen wasn't showing good results for me )
P.S. You might wanna crank up the CPU on a Performance, and switch off Night Light just in case.
Steam is installed as a flatpak ( isolation ) on a pure Debian stable with kernel 6.0* with no problems in functionality.

The only thing I'm looking for in this game is, full customization ( looks, and reshape ) of the ships :)
Nothing against the current designs, but I'd love to see an option where we actually can do our own designs :) Maybe I'd love my ship to look like a Borg Sphere ( Star Trek ), or something entirely different :) Just an idea, since we have the ability to manipulate a section in the Freighters :)

Ground combat could be improved with more different types of Sentinels ( not just floating toasters, cyberdogs, cyberspiders and Robocop on steroids :D )

Also, more random event space battles ( something like the Freighters saving, but with Living ships. Maybe saving them from another aggressive specie ? :)  )

These are just silly ideas, which you can ignore ofc, they're nothing else, but ideas, the game is great !

In any case, Thank you HG for the amazing product, keep up the good work, you have our support, as long as the rumors regarding Micro$oft are not real.

It's the badly coded game, that is responsible for this kind of shite.

Also important to know: This is the first and only game, where you have to have the quest marked, or it appears as if you didn't have the quest.
Example: Base computer archives search does only work, when the quest is highlighted. If it's not your Base Computer somehow doesn't know, that it has to search the archives.

I don't see the point in making a base with my limited tools and building materials, and I don't see a point in going to other planets if it's just going to be much of the same everywhere. This game is a space sandbox game, and I'd like to compare it to two of my favorite games ever in the sandbox and space genre: Minecraft and Outer Wilds respectively. 

Minecraft is similar in its infinite generation, and that itself can get repetitive and boring after a while but it's also a game that 1. has multiple, truly new environments to discover (traversal comes easy as well) whether that be the biomes, dimensions or landmarks, and 2. has a sense of autonomy, creativity and freedom concerning choices whether it be your own movement, customization or playstyle. I sense none of these things with No Man's Sky, the game just feels rigid and while at first going to different planets seemed cool at first I realized that it was just the same thing over and over again. 

Outer Wilds shares the theme of taking a spaceship and exploring. Both games have NPCs, both games have a learning curve for ship controls and management, and both games have different planets to go explore beyond the one you start on. The difference is that No Man's Sky's NPCs are boring and add nothing positive to the experience of the game. Flying the ship was genuinely fun at first, the thrill of that first initial launch into space and exploring new places was definitely amazing but quickly waned when I learned that there was nowhere really worth traveling to in the first place (and don't get me started on the dreadful combat AI of the enemy ships, fighting them is just so unfun) and to me ship management wasn't too tedious to warrant overly scathing remarks but it just wasn't for me. No Man's Sky's counterpart in this comparison (Outer Wilds) is better in all of these ways. It provides a sense of wonder and mystery (which is helped by a great soundtrack), has actual characters that have personalities and help you on your journey, and flying the ship (which at first can be clunky while learning the basic controls, and the game will stop at nothing to make fun of itself for this which is amazing) is a blast. 

If you're reading this and you're looking for a space game related to space that is truly compelling in its story and experience, go play Outer Wilds. Cheaper and just flat out better. If you like a good space mystery and enjoy puzzles, you'll enjoy it over No Man's Sky every day of the week.",1701454581,1701454581,False,1,1,0,1,True,False,False

NMS is the ultimate base for a super game, it is just going to take two developers working together in some way that I don't have any technical idea as to how to make it work, but I can see it.

The world generation can become repetitive over time, but I enjoy charting each planet. I think that there needs to be more ways an ecosystem can generate (more parts for animals & plants.) I start to see the same animal with minor differences after around ~7 hours.

The game is NOT AT ALL designed for multiplayer. If you play with friends, you each have your own (identical) objectives to do and haveto complete them individually, barely being able to work together or even base together. At best you will walk past eachother and say hi but apart from that it's still a completely singleplayer experience that just so happens to have other players on the map. I got this game for the sole purpose of playing with some friends as it would be far more fun than playing alone, but you might aswell just play alone. 

Personally, even playing alone is boring to me. Considering the fact that I got the game for a multiplayer experience without really knowing what to expect, it would be unfair not to mention that the game and each of its planets look very beautiful and the game has many interesting, unique and enjoyable features. On the other hand, the whole game just feels like a boring, aimless grind, there's no real difficulty and it's just not very thrilling or entertaining. So often you will go to a new planet that was basically the last one in a different colour palette, so exploring can quickly get boring.

 - Looks good with consistent style and a great engine, lots of great variation in the look and feel of celestial objects
 - Great choices on procedurally generated weapons (multitools), ships, upgrades, etc that make unwrapping your next upgrade a mini thrill each time or offering excitement when spotting a striking ship or tool
 - Lots of things to ""do"" in that you can explore quite a few different paths of self-established tasks ranging from exploring systems, hunting for multi-tools, ships or upgrades, commanding a fleet, searching for lore, farming plants and animals, building bases and mining operations, etc
 - I personally love the sound design (with a small gripe on the animals - millions of species and they pretty much all sound the same).  Everything sounds like it fits, and while I feel like this is a bare minimum requirement, the vast majority of titles just totally miss the mark here so this is a plus

[h3]The Problem[/h3]
There's really one [b]BIG[/b] gaping problem with this game that constantly left me questioning if I was having fun, and finally determining that I was not: 

[h2][b]There is no [i]challenge[/i][/b][/h2]

There is no real challenge.  No challenge that requires technical skill.  No challenge that requires aptitude.  No strategy or tactics required.  No resource supply management needed.  Nothing even behind a grind-wall. 
 You spend about 5 hours in game and you will easily be well equipped to handle the most difficult combat scenarios and a few more hours, reach the most distant and exclusive star systems with absolutely nothing standing in the way.  No tough space encounters.  No big bad groups of enemies.  No ""bosses"".  No challenges to ever come.  The only thing it demands of you, is your time.  And it won't reward you; you have to do that yourself

 - On-Foot Combat is point, click and hold fire, drop the enemy.  Rinse & repeat until your sentinel ""wanted level"" resets, or you just get tired of being pestered and dig a tunnel and sort your inventory for a few seconds to de-aggro.  The first 20 minutes of the game you might have to think about certain encounters, but every encounter has an easy escape either burrowing under ground or summoning the Anomaly, and nothing is lost if you avoid a fight other than wasted time
 - Starship combat is hold back button, click and hold fire, drop the enemy.  Enemy ships do not obey the same physics laws your ship is restrained to and perform the exact same silly maneuver - fly straight at you shooting, zip away from you in a straight line, then do a 180 and repeat
 - The only ""puzzles"" found require you to to do kindergarten math (addition or subtraction), or 2nd grade pattern recognition.  
 - All encounters are the same formula: Go here, kill or avoid (doesn't matter which), collect, return (optional)
 - You can set up mining systems on planets to get a regular flow of great resources to manufacture other useful elements or useless-except-for-selling items.  I've set up about 8 of these, in anticipation of something greater.  I've never returned to any except for a copper mine on my starting planet to refine a bit more chromatic metal.  BIG missed opportunity here since the building setup works so well and fits perfectly with the procedurally generated planets & moons - but it doesn't get you anything you need or even want.  There's nothing that requires you to pump out big resources that would be illogical to manually mine yourself.  No advanced [i]usable[/i] items that can only be crafted instead of bought; only sold for unit that you will be drowning in that don't buy anything useful.  No challenge that requires a good resource infrastructure to overcome.  It's just... there- in case you wanted to pretend you needed it.
 
The list will go on but it won't serve any more purpose here as further points require more experience with the game itself.  But to the reader:  If you like [b]pure[/b] casual, [b]pure[/b] exploration, [b]zero[/b] challenge - then yes definitely buy.  I know there are explorers out there that just love to explore for the sake of exploring.  This allows you to do so and does so [i]damn[/] well.  Guaranteed you will be visiting and naming star systems, planets, moons yourself, the first one to do so, and others may discover these in your wake.  You'll find interesting features, ships, fauna, and share them with a community that loves the unique things generated here.  And you'll have some well thought out and written lore to explore to keep it at least a little bit interesting.  

But that's a pretty niche audience.  Personally I was hoping for a [i]game[/i], where your performance matters and your actions directly affect whether you succeed or fail.  Even if it was buried somewhere in the Anomaly with nexus missions.  But (spoiler):  It's not.",1701221732,1701221732,False,5,0,0.531692206859588623,0,True,False,False

This game is worth 240 hours of Starfield in time DPS measurement.
I know this because I spent 100+ hours of Starfield and I got that much investment of time put in to play all of the content which equals to about 10 hours on No Man's Sky.
This is a serious investment for the holidays. Buy this now and play Starfield too and spot the differences on the better game.
I am an average Todd game consumer so maybe Starfield will be on equal footing on 10-20 years from now.

This game is just so good.  There's so much to do.  Even since adding the VR, they've added Expeditions, Settlements, the Variety Update, and so much more.  I'm currently playing an Expedition save that I just continued because I wanted to start fresh.  I recently got all of the achievements, which I basically never do because the game is just that good.  I only play games in VR these days, but I can play this game in VR or 2D.  This game still just gets better and better and almost every developer out there gives up on their games after a while.  This game just won't quit.  I love it and don't know what I'll do it if it ever goes away.

OLD REVIEW:  I played this game when it got its first decent update after grabbing it on sale a couple years ago.  I enjoyed it, but it was repetitive and resource management was a pain.  But I always found visiting new worlds to be magical.

Then, the Atlas Rises update came out, and the game finally worked in a way that made it incredibly enjoyable.  None of those hours reflect here, though, because I played them on Xbox One.  Resource management was finally possible and the game was incredibly playable.  Still hard not to run out of space, but the game was way more fun.

NOW, the VR update is out.  When I so much as heard that I could walk on alien worlds and meet new creatures and build bases IN VR?? well I almost wet myself I was so excited.  The prospect of doing what I wanted to do as a child was incredible and I can't believe I've had the opportunity to do this in my lifetime.  I bought a Valve Index just to play this game and I'm incredibly happy with both.  Getting to manually fly a ship through the cosmos and build a base on alien worlds has been everything I thought it would be and more.

Hello Games, you didn't have to stick with this game.  You could have taken the money and ran with it.  But, you proved that you're the Labor of Love we all hoped for and which has delivered many times over.  Thank you so much for such an amazing game!  (Now I just wish I had an even faster PC to play it on haha...it's a little pixelated on my GTX 1070, but I still think the magic of VR is so wonderful that it doesn't diminish the perfect of this game at all.)

In the seven years since the game came out, Hello Games has fully owned the disastrous launch of No Mans Sky, pouring an impressive amount of time and effort into making the game what they imagined it would be. 

Listing all the changes here would take far too much time, but suffice it to say that after several overhauls of the generation code and inclusion of new mechanics like base building, vehicles, entire new factions to work against the game is nowhere near what it was before, and in a good way. Choices abound for what you as a player can do, and it's easy to spend a significant amount of time focused on one aspect of the game before moving on.

Having said that, the core gameplay loop (""fly to a planet, land, scan as much as you can, fly off to the next"") is unchanged from the original version of the game, and while it's enjoyable enough to pull you through the storyline it can wear thin quickly. I've come back to No Man's Sky after major releases and restarted from scratch, but after a while (and that amount of time seems to be growing shorter) the core gameplay loop wears thin enough that I feel compelled to move on. That's not to say that No Man's Sky is a bad game, or that the core gameplay loop is bad- just that it's a level of repetition that may not appeal to people who need new or exciting mechanics throughout a game.

Original review:

On paper, No Man's Sky seems like an ideal game for those with an interest in space and space exploration: procedurally generated, with planets and animals and cool things to see and experience. A chance to boldly go.

Unfortunately, the reality of the game falls far short. While the player is able to fly a ship and explore, the similarities between systems, planets, and ships means a sense of 'been here before, done this before' sets in quickly. There is very little purpose to the game other than grinding for slightly better gear, which helps you grind even more. In and of itself that would be fine, if not for the fact that exploration fails to deliver anything awe inspiring or even vastly different to what you'll find in the first few hours.

Pros:

* Relatively beautiful - while the graphics are not the best, it does offer beautiful sights and interesting looking planets compared to other 'space exploration' type games.

* Atmosphere to surface flight - This was a selling point for me: to be able to go from orbit to surface without loading screens or loss of control.

Cons:

* Enjoyment is lost in a sea of blandness - Your options when on a planet consist of flying to a point of interest, walking to a point of interest, interacting with a point of interest, or shooting the ground. You *can* 'hunt' animals and Sentries, but with the rewards for doing so nearly nil (aside from a few 'blueprints' you'll get in the first few hours anyway). Planets seem to blend together, with nothing really standing out or inspiring the player to stay or explore further.

* Bad ship controls - The game is, ostensibly, an arcady space game, so some exceptions can be made for shoddy flight controls, but the amount of hand holding takes any sense of adventure or excitement out of flying. Single button presses to land or take off, inability to actually hit the ground, and guns that only affect a specific set of objects makes flying in No Man's Sky about as enjoyable as riding a city bus.

* The Grind - Grind in a game is ok: it can give use a goal and a sense of accomplishment when we finally get what we were grinding for. However, as in the case of No Man's Sky, if the grind is *all* that a game is it leads to frustration and the sense that a game is pointless.

* Static universe - NPC's don't move or really react to anything outside of conversation, NPC ships follow a preset flight path and don't flinch if you fly at them, even animals don't seem to react outside of the generic 'hostile' ones (that just charge at you). Instead of a living, exciting universe, No Man's Sky delivers a universe that feels as though the creator of it decided that physical presence is quite enough, and that he shouldn't bother with making his creations alive.

All in all, No Man's Sky could be defined as a 'good start': an interesting idea, a decent base to build a much more interest ing game on, and a solid technical demo. What it *isn't*, however, is worth $60. Nor does it seem likely that the creators of the game are going to build on to it and deliver us an amazing experience: instead it seems like what you see is what you get.

If it falls to $5 or under, it may be worth picking up for the minor enjoyment flying the ships brings, but any higher price than that and the value falls off sharply.",1479959935,1701178448,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update for 2021: Another impressive year of new features and improvements. I found the expeditions to be quite interesting and at times a bit challenging, and the rewards from them are quite helpful both in the expeditions and in normal play.

Original review: I pre-ordered No Man's Sky over two years ago and have been following it through the various updates and enhancements since.

I'm pleased to be able to honestly state that the game has become an interesting, engaging, and entertaining experience.

Whether it is exploring the innumerable, and highly variable, worlds, building bases on land, sea, and in space, forming a space fleet and having it assist (albeit limitedly) in space combat, or seeking out resources and upgrades for your equipment and vehicles - there is now a wide variety of activities to take part in.

Still, not every activity has great depth and over many hours various aspects of the game can become repetitive and boring.  Thankfully the mechanics for advancement (e.g. upgrades) alleviate some of this so that you can focus on what you enjoy.

It is also great to see Hello Games continuing to support their product and I look forward to seeing where they take the game in the future.",1542955622,1701170375,True,3,0,0.546539366245269775,0,True,False,False

Use the terrain modifier to dig yourself a hole and wait it out.

It's an amazing game with many things to do, the story line is a good length, although I can't say for sure how long it is because I did a lot of side missions on my way to the end. What I can say is that it took me about 90 hours including a lot of hours living ship hunting, sentinel ship hunting, hopping systems looking for ship upgrades, grinding nanites, and much more to be able to beat the game. The story isn't that hard, but I think it is quite interesting even though it can feel a bit repetitive at times. Overall, if you have the extra money to get it, you should, but other than that, just wait for a sale cause they happen pretty often. I think NMS is an amazing game with many things to do even after one completes the main storyline, and that the devs are amazing people for maintaining the game for the last 7 years. No Mans Sky is, I think, by far the only game deserving of the Labor of Love award because of how much content it is still receiving even after many years of release.

Trust me, I've been playing since 2018, and it has almost always been like this. The majority of updates are content islands with little in the way of connectivity - just a series of random rides in a cosmic carnival with almost nothing to do with one another, dashed with tiny tweaks to existing content. Mostly to the base game they're still trying to fix, of course, as Hello Games almost refuses to acknowledge or expand on what new they've added, instead opting to work on something completely different every single time. This, naturally, leads to even more potentially game-breaking bugs and optimization issues being introduced, and thus the cycle repeats. The amount of technical debt this game has accrued is [i]exhausting[/i].

I have to give them some credit; over 2022 they have put out a LOT of quality of life to make the game feel a little better. But it's all on an extremely shaky foundation: while being a little less tedious, the extremely dull basic gameplay loop has not changed in any meaningful way in YEARS. And any side content they've added in the meantime can be thoroughly completed in just a couple of hours, if they're not just dangling a shiny new ship to grind endless star systems for, anyways. I can count the number of updates they've done to address these issues on one hand.

To Hello Games, though this likely falls on deaf ears: Please focus solely on reworking and debugging the game as it currently exists instead of pumping out new content nonstop. You've accumulated SO MUCH goodwill with your dedicated fans, I'm sure we'll live if you take a bit to work things out.

You have the freedom to travel absolutely anywhere at anytime within this stunning, sprawling, and gorgeous procedurally generated universe; the only limit is your own courage to step into the unknown.

No Man’s Sky’s storyline is mysterious and intriguing. You begin your journey entirely stranded on a strange and hostile world, with nothing but your spacesuit to protect you. With enough luck (trust me, you’ll need it!) you will survive your first few minutes and discover a wrecked spacecraft nearby. The spacecraft responds to your suit’s input, as if it belongs to you, although you have no memory of ever owning this ship… Soon it becomes apparent that you must repair your ship and set sail into the black to find answers to these peculiar questions.

Gameplay is very flexible to whatever style you like best, anywhere from casual to professional. Don’t be discouraged at the beginning when the learning curve is steep, this will quickly change as you learn to survive the harsh environments. As you continue onwards you will have the opportunity to upgrade your suit and trusty multitool to match new challenges, while making old challenges a piece of cake. Tasks that used to be a fight for survival when I started is now a relaxing walk in the park. Exploring exciting new planets in the game is a great thing to help you unwind after a long day.

And perhaps one of the best parts of all; No Man’s Sky is still receiving frequent updates with amazing new content even after four years from initial release. This game is light-years from where its journey started and guaranteed to travel even further!

This expansive space exploration game has grown into an unparalleled universe that captivates players with its sheer scale, diverse planets, and continuous stream of updates.

The initial release faced criticism for not living up to the lofty promises, but Hello Games didn't shy away from the challenge. Instead, they embraced it, pouring years of hard work into transforming No Man's Sky into the thriving, vibrant experience it is today. The dedication to improvement and innovation is evident in the numerous updates, each introducing substantial content, refining gameplay mechanics, and expanding the universe in ways players could only dream of.

The sheer scale of No Man's Sky is awe-inspiring. The procedurally generated galaxy offers an astronomical number of planets to explore, each with its own unique ecosystems, creatures, and challenges. The addition of multiplayer functionality further enhances the sense of shared exploration, as players can now embark on interstellar journeys together.

Beyond the vast exploration opportunities, the game's narrative has also evolved significantly. The introduction of meaningful storylines, engaging lore, and the overarching mystery of the Atlas Path adds depth and purpose to the seemingly boundless universe. The narrative improvements, coupled with enhanced graphics and a refined user interface, showcase the developers' commitment to delivering a top-tier gaming experience.

While No Man's Sky has faced its share of hurdles, the ongoing support and transparent communication from Hello Games have fostered a community that appreciates the journey as much as the destination. The game's evolution from a contentious launch to a beloved, ever-expanding universe is a testament to the transformative power of a dedicated development team's labor of love.

In conclusion, No Man's Sky stands as a shining example of redemption in the gaming industry. Hello Games' unwavering commitment to improvement, fueled by a clear passion for their creation, has turned No Man's Sky into an unparalleled space odyssey that continues to redefine the boundaries of exploration and innovation.",1701106883,1701106883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my first hundred hours or so I never even left the Euclid Galaxy (apart from the endings of a few expeditions). And it's always fun to dive back in every once and a while, and feel like that lone explorer again. Or roleplay as the captain of a ship like the Enterprise while you're aboard your freighter. And it never ceases to be fun to explore new features added every new update.

Unfortunately, you almost always get bored eventually, which is why nowaways I usually only boot up No Man's Sky when a new update is released. Of course I'm probably going to reach the center of the Euclid Galaxy in Permadeath mode soon, perhaps 100% the game.

Even after my advanced time spent in this game, No Man's Sky is still a reliable screenshot generator. Since photo mode allows you to move that system's local star(s) relative to you, you can always create a beautiful sunset or eclipse photo with any background. But that feeling of being a lone explorer always seems to catch me again. To pull me back into my memories of this game. I may go through the entire story of No Man's Sky one more time, just for the fun and nostalgia. I miss Apollo.

It started with an explosion.
Everyone was on fire. There was screaming, and stuff was melting. Everything quickly became a large, heaping, pile of rubble.

Then slowly, with some large updates, it started getting built up.

Base building, farming, exocraft, a 30-ish hour story.
It had become a frame of a decent roller coaster.

Then suddenly, NEXT appeared and added a nice body to it. It took what we had, and overhauled it. It was still rough, but now it worked well!

After it came out, it was synonymous with a terribly thought out release, and yet the phrase ""do a No Man's Sky"" now means to bring a bad release to a suitable state through continual effort. Was that effort worth it though? I think so, though that comes with some reservations.

For lack of a better term, it's an ""ambient"" game. While there is combat in space and on the ground/in vehicles, this is not the focus of the game. In the same way, there is a story as well as several quest chains that flesh out the universe, the story is not what you play the game for. It's largely a very relaxing game, and a lot of it is simply flying planet to planet system to system finding cool shit, building bases, and looking for interesting star ships to buy. It's not a high stakes space game, and if you go in with that expectation you will be very disappointed. It's a relatively slow sunset drive, not the Indy 500. This is also not a game that emphasizes player skill, or builds, or meta knowledge, or anything similar really, which leads to a common complaint about it, which is that it is ""a mile wide and an inch deep"". 

This is true, to an extent. While some updates, such as the update to Sentinels (the primary enemy the player will face on the ground) have added depth to aspects of it, many parts of the game are still extremely simple. There is some content that due to a lack of variety as well as a lack of reasons to engage with it that despite promising more activities and more time you will deal with one or twice at most (I'm looking at you underwater locations). Exploration can yield some truly amazing planets, but often it can give you nearly identical ones. Despite this, I would still recommend the game, though I do feel the price when not on sale is a bit steep for a game that released 7 years ago (albeit one receiving continuous updates). The game frequently goes on sale for half off, which I think is a very fair price.

TLDR: Very good game, enjoyable but not exciting, criticisms of depth are valid but the game remains enjoyable and the developers seem to be willing to go back and add depth to old content. Solid 8/10, but buy when it goes on sale.",1701063144,1701063144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that said here are the things about no mans sky that i find important to state

Subjective:
         Light/non-existent story
         VR Supported
         Heavily Stylized slightly cartoony aesthetic
         Resource grind game
         Procedural generation
         Make your own fun style of gameplay

Pros:
       Lots of planet variation
       Minimal Loading Screens
       Plenty of things to do
       somewhat decent ship variation
       decent base builder

Cons: 
       Plenty of Pop in
       Procedural generation clipping issues (some times things are generated in weird/problematic ways)
       No real Unique Characters/ backstories outside of main quest
       Simplistic Combat
 
Very Grindy game with no real plot ( it has one but it is a glorified tutorial), but for what it is i enjoyed it. i'm sure everyone already aware but the devs have been updating the game consistently adding new content at a good pace since launch. if you were looking for a starfield type narrative space game this is not it, it is closer to elite dangerous in structure, while being more minecraft like with resource collection and base building being the bulk of the gameplay.",1701061287,1701061329,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is very beautiful, fantastic, and multiplayer makes it really fun to play with friends.
It's the perfect casual gaming experience in my opinion.

The freedom to explore and build anywhere on planets is truly convenient and fun.
Combat is simple yet engaging, so it's a good balance for casual gamers.

Unfortunately, the casual aspect makes the game rather grindy in its activities.
The tasks the player can do are shallow because they are built on simple core tasks: you always end up just going somewhere, gather or kill something to do the activity. Rinse and repeat.

That said, there are LOTS of small variations on everything, combined with the text-based narrative, it's brings enough depth to be fun for a long time.

The last negative point is that planets are single biomes, so landing anywhere and exploring nearby will show you almost everything there is to see. It makes exploring whole planets uninteresting. A quick local survey is enough, unless you really like the planet's combination.

I really like this game overall. Hello Games has created something gorgeous and amazing. It's definitely worth playing, in regular doses without burning yourself with grind.",1471100252,1701021927,True,3,0,0.511202156543731689,0,True,False,False

I bought this game a few days ago. I noticed it when it was first launched and I waited a bit to see what the community says, I read both positive and negative reviews trying to avoid spoilers just to get an idea about what the game is about and if it's something of my interest. Following up the initial disaster of launch, and reading about the backstory of it I didn't buy it at the time. However I did look back and I checked it a few times, because from the trailers it had potential to be a nice game. I saw the surge of positive comments but what struck me the most is that this game was said to have no further payments once you buy it, and that there are no micro transactions BUT the developers, the studio is still working on it and updating it constantly, that really caught my attention because that shows dedication, passion and prospects...it means that someone really cares about their project and will do their best to develop it. I decided to buy it and give it a go. 
I am happy with the game and I absolutely do not regret paying for it. I have played 25 hours so far and I can see that I am only at the very basics yet I have discovered so much! If you consider buying it, from what you see in the trailers that is exactly what you can do in the game, and have an immense freedom. It might feel slow at times because of course mining for resources and going places it's normal, but the discoveries and what it offers besides the visuals, gameplay and freedom you have in the game it's absolutely a must have as a game if you want to just relax and explore!


For the developers: 
you have earnt my respect. What you have done and are doing is something that I never thought I will see again. Your dedication to this project and passion is such an example to the other big companies and studios, I was amazed to research about you and find your backstory and the number of members your team has and seeing the game you have managed to offer us it is something that I am amazed of! The move that you did after the failure at launch shows how mature you are, shows that you believe in your visions for this project. You have my support and in future, other projects you might be working on I will dive head first because of what you have done here! Thank you and keep up with your passions! You have proven to be far far ahead of companies like EA, Bungie, Activision and other big names like these, they should learn from you!




Edit (200+ hours after original review):
The game still is amazing, so much more left to explore and do. Base building is something I am yet to dive in, but have visited other players' bases and the possibilities are countless (you want to make a base on a paradise planet? how about a desolate low gravity moon? how about underwater? and a skybase? in a cave? on your mothership? want to just make a farm? or build something to have fun with friend? how about a monument for other players to visit? etc). I am yet to find my own robotic creature and make it a companion. Finding S class ships never gets tiring.   SPOILER ALERT (stop here if you haven't finished the main story!!): I have yet to visit more galaxies, beyond ofc Euclid galaxy, I reached and scratched the surface of Hilbert dimension and Calypso galaxy, but what about the other 252 remaining ones? Mindblowing. 
So yes, the game is more than worth it.

Improvements/suggestions: 
1) they could add some PvP elements to the game, such as the Nexus PvE missions you get, they could make some PvP ones, so once you accept the type of mode you want to play in the Anomaly, you leave it and you get warped to another galaxy (for example Calypso where planets are more chaotic and full of storms) could be one, where you have to fight others. Or something like a PvPvE where 2 teams fight to get access to some space curiosity or space station, or fight other players and sentinels to capture X amount of Monoliths... or fight to capture a portal, open it to go to next location for ""round 2"". At the moment there are no PvP elements besides just players deciding to kill each other randomly and anything at this point could be good.
2) space battles with your own fleet. If I engage with enemies in space, whether pirates or THAT pirate fleet that is trying to destroy the civilian one, and I call in my fleet, they just stand there watching me destroy everyone else, but it would be nice if the big ships would get involved too.",1631658063,1701001854,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The game is a bit of a grind in the first hour you play it but after that it's so much fun. They have regular updates to the game that add cool new editions to you're own journey! The number one thing that I like about No Man's Sky is the fact that everyone that plays this game has their own story! You will always start on a planet that is undiscovered, and since the game world is a literal scale to size galaxy, you will be the only person to see what you see on you're own play through. You may come across a planet or two that someone else has discovered, but your main journey and own choices (unless they're mandatory for a quest), will keep you going to undiscovered planets. Few games if any can create this unique sense of wonder that No Man's Sky does.

I hope this review helps if you're using reviews to make a decision to purchase. It's definitely worth the money since the game is so big you can't go to every planet for just a second and see them all in a whole lifetime. If you get the game I recommend documenting it as a fun little YouTube let's play to show others interested in the game your discoveries. Since you and your friends will likely be the only people to ever see them. I was going to do something like that myself in the near future cause I thought it would be fun!

Crossovers ( Mass Effect and Dune so far) are spot on and really great!
The expeditions are time limited and really fun to play and try different approaches to the game.

It is once more (2023) my ""Labour of love"" Steam Awards nomination. 
The amount of new content you have every year that is easily comparable from what you'd get with a paid DLC in any other game is worth the price and they do go on at 50% here and on other platforms. I see this as an investment more and more than I see its price as a cost.

It is now what you'd wanted Starfield to be when it came out but will only get in 3 to 5 years after its initial release!

NMS is one of my favorite redemption stories in gaming, and I enjoy it greatly on and off.  
Expeditions, although a few years old in concept at the writing of this (and not always available), are still so much fun to do, and one of the best ways to experience the ""early game"".  
New major updates every year- it's more than I could have asked for.  
Luv u hello games, & ty for continuing to make NMS better and better every year. <3

Notable pro: ""Grinding"" from a late game standpoint almost feels very optional, not a slog through a marsh of irritation and mid content.  A healthy amount of grinding is necessary in the beginning of the game, but it's not nearly as aggressive or time consuming as it used to be, or like some *other* games.",1700959644,1700959644,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

No Man's Sky has undergone a remarkable transformation since its initial release, evolving into a sprawling universe of endless exploration and creativity. As an avid gamer, I found myself captivated by the immersive experience offered by this ambitious title.

The exploration aspect of ""No Man's Sky"" is nothing short of breathtaking. The vastness of the procedurally generated universe is awe-inspiring, with each planet offering a unique landscape, climate, and ecosystem. From lush, vibrant forests to desolate, rocky terrains, the diversity is staggering. The thrill of discovering new species, rare resources, and hidden secrets on every celestial body kept me constantly engaged.

One of the game's standout features is the building architecture, which allows players to leave their mark on the universe. The ability to construct bases and settlements on any planet adds a personal touch to the exploration experience. Whether it's a modest outpost or an extravagant architectural masterpiece, the freedom to shape the world around you is both empowering and fulfilling.

Crafting technology in ""No Man's Sky"" is a deeply rewarding process. Collecting resources, refining materials, and upgrading equipment provide a satisfying sense of progression. The game's crafting system is intuitive and allows for experimentation, encouraging players to tailor their tools and technology to suit their playstyle.

The ongoing updates and expansions by the development team have significantly enriched the game. Features like multiplayer, community events, and a narrative overhaul have transformed ""No Man's Sky"" into a living, breathing universe that continues to evolve.

While the initial release faced criticism for falling short of expectations, the dedication of the developers to improve and expand the game has turned it into a shining example of post-launch support. The dedication to the community is evident, and Hello Games has successfully turned ""No Man's Sky"" into a benchmark for the potential of ongoing game development.

""No Man's Sky"" has become a masterclass in redemption stories within the gaming industry. Its vast, procedurally generated universe, coupled with the freedom to explore, build, and craft, creates an unparalleled gaming experience. If you seek a game that allows you to lose yourself in a limitless cosmos of discovery and creativity, ""No Man's Sky"" is a stellar choice.",1700920658,1700920658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's now November 2023, and I'm updating my review once again to say that this game deserves the Labor of Love award more than any other game ever released. As an aspiring indie game dev myself, I can't possibly imagine the talent and dedication put into making something this incredible. It looks like the kind of thing only a very large company with hundreds of talented individuals could ever produce, and I genuinely would not believe you if you said it was initially developed by just 6 people. The small scale of the team continues to astonish me, and the fact that they're still pushing boundaries and porting to new platforms is truly amazing.

No Man's Sky goes above and beyond anything I've ever seen before and likely will ever see again. It's been 7 years since release now, the game has been out for a while, and it sees more updates and continued support than games even released in the last one year (case in point, WWE 2K22 going offline just a year after launch).

It was a game that I had an eye on for a while, but wasn't to sure about, due to it not being very popular when it first launched in 2016. So you can imagine the complete shock that I got when I opened it up for the first time, and found myself stranded on a strange world, with no ship, no communication, and nothing but a tiny laser to help me out. It was an exhilarating experience. The atmosphere was so different from any other game that I had played, and was simply amazing. I started the current expedition soon after, and loved the intriguing story line and narrative of everything that was revealed, the ATLAS being my favorite part.
I think that No Man's Sky is a wonderful game, full of millions of different things to do and collect, but every little thing has so much depth and detail, that it provides such a... I don't know what the right word is to describe it, but it is so much fun to play.

The game got much hate at its start.. but.. and this is a big BUT.. the devs didn't stopped working on their game.. they released so much good content to improve their game over the last years.. and honestly, this dev team is the best I have ever seen.

Literally no other game got so much love and work put into after a bad start.. this game is(even if I have not that much playtime) one of the best games of the last years.

My personal wish for the future of the game would be even more beautiful planets, even more to discover and see on this planets.. like several new cool biomes, structures, dungeons maybe, nice and cool caves with rare ore.. this would be the best thing for the game in my opinion. Every other aspect of the game got so much love until now and is really great. (Maybe some more cool multiplayer features too in the future).",1575914151,1700877782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pro:
+ huge game universe (over 18 quintillion planets)
+ free huge content updates / patches
+ many quests
+ discoveries (tech blue prints, plants, animals, alien languages)
+ mechs, spaceships and fleets to command and control

Neutral:
= main story line is ok, not very breath-taking

Con:
- some of the procedural generated ALF's are very weird looking (or maybe irl appropriate?)

Result:
A great game with lots of content which seems to be updated in the near future too. I totally recommand to buy and check it out. One of the games in my favorite list that i will return back to occasionally to see the new content.

All i can say the developers redeemed themselves and finally delivered all promised and more.
Right now they have more ship designs, more creatures, vehicles, better base building, multiplayer option and now you can actually meet people in the Space Anomaly space station.
I returned to the game a while back but i forgot to update this review.
So after experiencing the updates that where added i can say that the game is way better and you can actually enjoy it alone and with friends.
With the addition of seasonal expeditions now you can find players all around the galaxy.


Original Review:

This game is an Single player game.
If you expected multiplayer you are very wrong.
Overall it can be a good game but not present yet, who knows maybe one day.
Right now is repetitive and you can see all the game in maximum 2 hours even if you didn't reach the center of the galaxy, and that is because the content of the first planet/solar system repeats all over again and the only thing that change is the colors on the planets and a little the creatures but basically are all the same.

So I have chosen to write a new review, because I didn't like my old one. In my opinion this game is worth it. It's sad that it doesn't work all that well on my  linux pc currently, but it used to work better. It kinda choses on its own if it will work or linux or not. It also feels like the loading times got longer, but that might be a me problem. I never really cared for the story mode in this game so I can't give opinion on that. I can confirm that this game is in fact better with friends. I am far enough in the game to say that have gotten pretty bored and feel like I have basically seen it all. If you should pay full price I don't really know. I don't buy any games on full price anymore, but that is just me. 


(old review)
Choosing whether or not to recommend this game is not an easy task. It still has bugs and the frame-rate isn't good on my PC. Many planets and animals look alike. The game is best experienced the very first time. When you haven't seen the same weird birds on hundreds of systems that all have similar planets. The only reason I'm recommending this game is, because I have had fun with it. Mainly in my first play-through. I haven't finished the story, because I don't care (I have spent most of my time exploring).

So you start out, crashed on a planet, a little common sense and you know how to find resources and within a short space of time, your ship is repaired.  You gather a few resources and jump right in, flying around, finding lore and more about the planet.   A few hours later, your probably ready to jump to space, find the station, find a new planet or moon, rinse repeat, build, explore, improve, move on to hopefully reach the center of this universe. 

My journey is slower as I want to explore the starting planet and system, before taking the plunge, but there's no rush, I don't need to be first and I probably won't be last, but I'm enjoying the experiance.


It does have a few teething issues, I bounced into space when taking off.  Some sounds get irritating quickly and inventory space is a nightmare to manage, but these are little things.

If you want quick paced action adventure, then SC, ED or EvE would probably be more suitable, but for a relaxing jaunt around the cosmos.....  Sean and the team of Hello Games, did a wonderful job.

Ongoing progress..... so may add more thoughts at a later date.

It's Amazing! You can upgrade and tweak your multi-tool to your hearts content.

The only complaint I have is that the game sometimes stops responding and needs to be force-stopped. So make sure to bring a save beacon with you when going out on long planetary explorations.

No Man's Sky is a visually stunning exploration game that fulfills its promise of an expansive universe. The vast array of planets, creatures, and activities ensures a captivating experience. Engaging in resource mining, trading, and space battles provides a sense of continual progression.

Yet, amidst the cosmic wonders, a touch of loneliness prevails. The multiplayer aspect, though present, lacks the bustling interactions one might expect. Encounters with other players are infrequent, leaving the universe feeling somewhat desolate.

The game's visuals are breathtaking, with each procedurally generated planet offering a unique and immersive environment. No Man's Sky has undergone significant improvements since its launch, with dedicated updates enhancing graphics and gameplay.

In summary, No Man's Sky is a visually enchanting journey into the unknown. While the occasional sense of isolation in multiplayer may be a drawback, the game's continuous evolution through updates makes it a compelling experience for those captivated by the mysteries of the cosmos.

Please be patient [/h1]

No Man's Sky is a game that I keep getting back to. I pre-ordered it because I wanted a game where you can explore an infinite universe. It delivered on that part but was a let down on many others. 
After the post-launch hate rush had calmed down, the devs have introduced much of the promised content in to the game. The core story has been expanded, base building and exocrafts have been added. Preparations have been made for multiplayer. 
A lot has changed since launch and the devs are working hard to add new content. 

NMS is slowly turning into the game it was supposed to be.

[i] Edit 11/2019 [/i]

The developers keep updating NMS regularly with new features and many of those are community requested. Player feedback is used to make this game bigger and better. At this point in time Hello Games have more than redeemed themselves after the launch of No Man's Sky.

[i] Edit 11/2021 [/i]

The game is still being updated with new content. It is amazing to see how much love Hello Games has given NMS during all these years! I have nominated this game for the [i] Labor of Love [/i] award for multiple years in a row and this year is no different. Thank you for the great game!

[i] Edit 11/2022 [/i]

Yet again I nominate this game for the [i] Labor of Love [/i] award. Also wanted to add that this game is very fun to play on the go with the Steam Deck! I have now played NMS on a standard desktop, in VR, on a TV through Steam Link, and on a portable platform. PC gaming is amazing!

Whether you followed the giant s#!7storm during the release or never heard of this game, i will provide a solid idea what No Man's Sky is all about and if you would enjoy it. Playing it with the right expectations will prevent dissappointments, and grant really awesome moments. But first we need a level ground:
Did the company behind NMS advertise content pre-release that didn't appear in the first versions? [i] Yes [/i]. Did they realise their mistakes? [i] Yes [/i]. Are they working their butts off to provide the best gaming expierience they can squeeze out of the setting with big updates including frequent exchange with the community and adding most wanted features? [i] Hell YES! [/i]. But...but are there still bugs and unpolished parts? [i] Of course [/i]. 
[b] So, whats the gaming expierence all about? [/b]
NMS can be a lot, but at the core is the exploration of space, mostly planets, either in first person (VR too) or third person camera. It is up to you, to follow the main story branches or dive without a guide into an universe of fully explorable planets, striving to survive and interacting with 5 different alien races. Since the ""NEXT Update"" you can even do all that in multiplayer. Once you know the basics of keeping yourself alive and crafting, you can write your very own stories: Do you want to be a rich trader, using the different industrial specialisations of star systems for efficient trade routes, travelling yourself and sending out your fleet to different missions? You can. Do you want to join the space pirates with your friends, battling other ships or huge freighter in space, smuggling contraband? Break into production facilities to steal valueable technology information, even with upgradeable vehicles to aid your maneuver? You absolutely can. Want to side quest for eternity to help every living being you come across at the surface or in a space station, turning every stone, scanning every lifeform, unburrowing every old alien relic? You guessed it, you can! But, if you don't thrive for all that and just look for a quiet, lush place to build a nice homebase above or below water, feeding indigenous animals and enjoy the artistic pictures the light, clouds and terrains create infront of your very eyes, you got the right game! And if you change your mood, you can always switch from one of the above to another within a blink of an eye.
I could go on like this for a while, but to cut the long story short: NMS gives you an immense amount of freedom paired with magic moments, guaranteed no matter how you play it. Examples: You can finally buy that really expensive exotic ship you always wanted - Your friend got eaten by some serious horror creatures you awakened - You dive with your submarine to the bottom of a red sea to find ancient technology that is worth a furtune - Really otherworldy biomes twist your mind and fill your screenshot gallery as well as the trophy section in your home base. 
These are the kind of stories that make the game (paired with the aesthetics) a must-buy for every player that enjoys the space setting. Underlying is a nice ""constant progress"" engine. No matter what you do, it feels rewarding and gives you the ability to enhance your ship and land vehicles, your much needed inventory space as well as your weapons. 
That being said, you need some time to get going, it is easy to understand (you only ""need"" to consult the wiki for enhanced crafting to save yourself some headache), but at the start it takes time to gather ressources, fullify quest etc. Later on, when you are better equipped, the gathering part gets shorter and shorter. With enough credits in your bank you will have quick access to most materials, if you want to. Btw, there are no micro-transactions or paid DLC, all the great new contet is free. 
From one of the most hyped games, to one of the biggest disappointments in gaming history and the rock bottom of reviews, back now to an all-time classic, THIS is No Man's Sky for you! Don't judge too early if you run into a few bugs or die at first because you rolled a hazardous planet as your starting location! Learn, adapt, enjoy!

Like with most companies...it is about not telling the whole truth or ""manipulating"" the truth. It's about how we can ""make"" people think or imagine. I believe I heared him say there was no mp on Colbert Late night (i can be wrong though(YES, HE SAID THERE WAS MP[edit]), but this proves my point. It was left in the middle, they just didn't talk about it and that's how people believed there was mp for instance. [edit: he did talk about it. At first is was yes, than it was very rare to find each other, but now it is NO]

All everybody is saying (all opinions) is true. This type of game needs its player to imagine for it and give it a feel. If you are not a player like that, this game will really hurt your brain. 
I, for instance, just sometimes float above a planet and play some music and smoke some devils lettuce and that's it. Then i pick up my controller and find some words to learn. It might seem crazy, but that's how i can make this game very enjoyable. 

[THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART]
So to conclude this essay ;) I want to say that this game is doomed to be a subjective experience. No story, no new gameplay, little to no action.... so basically you need to be the game...you need to give the game its story etc. [edit: if you can't or don't want to (and yes, you shouldn't have to), this game will suck]

Is this is good way to compromise, the whole love/hate relationship players have with this game? Or am I talking nonsense again....you tell me!

I recommend this game, if you are a cool, laid-back, sexy and super smart guy like me. Be imaginative and take your time.

Although I didn't play it for long, this game brought me a very impressive visual experience. Building the base, exploring unknown planets, upgrading the spaceship equipment, and learning alien languages are all very enjoyable. As an astronomy enthusiast, I hope future updates will further enrich the game content, improve some physical effects to make them more realistic, such as black hole swallowing, starburst, three-body motion, etc. In addition, I hope to improve the map to explore real content and improve the surface environment of planets, because too many celestial bodies have the same mineral and biological model, and the climate is not extreme. In addition, some celestial bodies such as neutron stars, nebulae, and gas giant planets can be added. Finally, because I didn't play it for long, I don't quite understand the plot's worldview yet. However, I feel that each galaxy has a race and space station is strange.

---------------------

After giving this game some time, I have to finally give it the thumbs down.  There's not much I can say that hasn't been said already in all of the reviews.

After 50+ hours in, it is pretty boring.  Just different coloration on each planet.  Animals all started looking the same.  And it's basically limitless grinding for resources/money rather than exploration.  Flight controls are terrible.  Interactions with other species is pointless and boring.  They literally just sit/stand there and do nothing.  All the same.

And as I came back to this page to rate it I decided to watch some of the trailers again.  It is extremely disappointing that the game is nothing like what it appeared in the trailers.  But as revealed, that's because they were fairly scripted.

There is nothing compelling me to keep playing this game.

It worked on my HTC Vive system, looked good, played good, sounded good.  Has some in-game tutorial and instructions as you go along with story.    The devs have been good over the years since it's launch to make more Free content updates for this game.  There is limited time multiplayer events to play through for each expansion.  You have a Normal mode, Survival mode, Permadeath mode, Sandbox mode, and Community Event mode.  Has a Huge universe for you to explore.  Has 27 steam achievements.  Has Multiplayer mode, that is busy.  Has crafting system.  

It has VR support for 4 HMD systems. I tried it with my HTC Vive, worked ok, with the amount of control buttons the Vive has.  The last update had improvements on the VR support.  Plays good with Valve Index.  Playing in VR is comfortable and doable, but there is some situations that might cause motion sickness.

No Man's Sky is an action-adventure survival game played from a first or third person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.  Has galactic sandbox of 18 Quintillion planets tallying up to 31,7000,000,000,000,000,000,000 km2, with procedural generated worlds.

Buy this game, if you like Space exploration and survival games.

STEAMDECK - runs WAYY better and stable on my deck in all modes vs. 2022 gen gaming PC where i get a fair amount of random crashes.

Massive improvement from initial release, would definitely pay for DLC to continue supporting the great updates the devs pop out.
2023 ~FREE UPDATES~ were super cool! (personally didnt have time to play but watched over S/O's shoulder while i was doing other stuff.)

Only major gripe i have - Multiplayer feels hollow or halfway;
Yes it exists in some ways but you cant interact or do all that much together.. 
like build a base together? nope. 
Can you visit each others bases? kinda.. it seems to not hold on to a list of places you've visited but there isnt a great way to save favorites because good luck remembering names. Even when you visit, its kinda meh as you can only interact so much.. its not like you can build a big farm together or even have bases all that close to each other. 

Beyond Base type things, its also kinda hard to sync up together to do missions together or get someone up to speed; feels like people meet up for one or two things and then everyone's missions kinda send them separate ways.. missions should be SYNC-able or if someone is starting a new basic/non-story mission you should be able to join and split profits or otherwise.. have a difficulty ramp or whatever. Space fights are kinda basic and, at least when i was playing, seemed to be just never ending-nuisance with no reward or challenge..

There are also some major mission glitches that happen from even being in 'online mode'.. like im going on a never ending LY jump train for way too long and the mission reset stuff never works.. seems to be tied to multiplayer things.

-----
Firstly, probably my favorite thing about this game is for the most part you can tweak all the ""difficulty"" settings on the fly.. don't feel like fighting a bunch of XYZ right now? turn down that setting for now.

overall good game - some refer to it as almost space minecraft in a sense. Sometimes you question UI/design choices because some things can be very tedious especially with a controller. Some mechanics are frustrating at times ie when fighting off space pirates attacking a freighter, if just one hint of damage is done to that freighter's storage (something the pirates fly around and past constantly - ya know theyre trying to steal it) then YOU get flagged as a bad guy by the local enforcement.. who werent even around to fight off the pirates anyways lol. I certainly prefer the way some other games do space things; the local planet has no map and are often quite barren (would be nice to have a dash of bigger civilizations), the local planetary system map is basic, and especially the galaxy map is pretty terrible and youd have NO way of knowing where you've been, where you could go (its limited ""view"" distance), etc. You can only easily go back to other distant places youve been by teleporting between space stations or bases, you cannot just see flags on the galaxy map far away they have to be pretty close.

Definitely not perfect, there are some glitches for sure and known issues that need to be sorted. multiplayer realllllly screws up a lot of missions and playing with friends doesn't really add much so i wish they'd focus more on fixing the hiccups there and providing team-specific tasks/quests etc. in some upcoming DLC. Oh and the only way to find friends is by going to a specific game space-station, landing, and then leaving for it to prompt if you want to go to their system.. you have no indication of where people are on galaxy map.

Oh and unlocking the alien languages is an absolute CHORE, not required but yikes..

Suggestions:
- Fix up multiplayer integrations more  - like base building etc.
- More base fun stuff like farming and elaborate builds not just walls and cosmetics
- Why so much planet mining but basically no space mining / space trucking (deliveries and trades or escort missions) - yes it exists a tiny bit but i want to go mine asteroids and capture space junk, resources, debris, and random alien tech..
- etc. to what i touched on above.",1672537099,1700770580,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

No Man's Sky has come a long ways from the first release. 

I have found it fairly addictive and have already spent ~200 hours on it.

[i]If you don't have tens of hours per week to spend on a game, then find another game. I find that No Man's Sky is most entertaining when I can play it for ~12 hours straight in each sitting and you will likely have a similar experience.[/i]

I have not tried the VR graphics, but I'm thinking about it.
The regular graphics are reasonably well done, however, as far as variety goes, I am starting to find each new world similar to worlds I've seen in the past and I can't tell much of a difference between the various Frigates or the various starships. Each class of Freighter (capital ship) seems fairly similar too. The carbon and dihydrogen crystals that can be found on every world are always the same. The red, blue and yellow plants that can be found on every world are the same (oxygen, boost and sodium plants). 

The gameplay is a repeating loop of flying the starship from planet to space station, using teleporters to warp from station to station and base to base, using the scanner to find resources, mining resources, setting up new bases to more easily access certain resources, selling various found and crafted items to any galactic market hub, buying things you don't want to mine or build, managing the Freighter and Frigate fleet, and exploring the various planets for structures, monoliths, crashed ships and to accomplish some of the rather few missions that you can pick up from the mission boards on Space Stations and at the Anomaly.
There are various other gameplay loops and details that I omitted as my main point is that you will very quickly become accustomed to these gameplay loops and will find yourself repeating them over and over and over again as you go about playing No Man's Sky.

I have greatly enjoyed base building even though I have yet to unlock all of the base parts.

I have greatly enjoyed the Expeditions [i](specifically 1 and 4 as I have yet to play 2 or 3)[/i]. 
I look forward to trying Expeditions 2 and 3 in the near future. 

One day I'll take a perma-death-mode iteration to the center of the galaxy(s), but that likely won't happen for many months (or even years) of real time.

-> 2023 Fall Update (859 hours played):
Now that I have completed Expeditions 1 - 6 (and attempted #7), unlocked most of the base parts and have played many hundreds of hours more (than the 1st review) I can add the following (as what is above still applies):
A. Trying to find specific versions of specific (frigates, freighters, ships, multi-tools) is incredibly time consuming, even with the NMS Glyph Exchange (and other similar websites). Certain characteristics (such as particular color schemes) simply can't be found. [i]It would be hugely helpful if Hello Games incorporated some sort of ""Ship Yard"" type space station in some number of star systems such that a Player could fully customize the appearance of their Freighter, Frigates and Ships. It would also be hugely helpful if the Anomaly (or some other place or set of places) had a ""Multi-tool Customizer"" or ""Multi-tool Constructor"" such that the appearance (and possibly Type) could be adjusted to whatever suited the player. These things don't yet exist, so you'll have to try to use a save editor, not that that is any easier.[/i]
B. Trying to ""max out"" or ""max stat"" (anything) is not fun. It is hugely time consuming, takes a lot of resources, and doesn't necessarily make a noticeable difference in regular game play.
C. Missing an expedition means not being able to attempt that expedition, possibly forever (at least without some sort of trick or hack). I have missed ~5 expeditions so far and will likely miss more as my work and life schedules don't necessarily allow me the time to play during the expedition's time limit. Players who join after an expedition is complete might never have a chance at it. [i]I am looking forward to Hello Games incorporating some sort of ""Choose your Expedition"" from a ""New Expedition Game"" choice when making a new character. If such a thing is added to the game then I'd be able to attempt the Expeditions that I missed in whatever order most suited me. [/i]

I still enjoy playing No Man's Sky, however, as the core game play loops haven't changed, I will soon become bored, again.",1638149512,1700769790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It just drops you somewhere without any specific instructions -- except for the first 10 minutes -- and you can ignore the plot altogether. No one would be there to force the ""entertainment"" for you, you will have to do it yourself. No one will force you or push you to do anything specific. If you prefer for your games to constantly push you and provide you with new and more exciting experiences -- this is not a game for you.

However, if you like sandbox-like games, if you like exploration and hunting for resources (fuel, crafting materials, even the oxygen you're breathing with), if you like when the no one forces the pace on you -- you'll find yourself at home. I think that if you're familiar with Russian-made ""Space Rangers"", old X-Tension and X2 games, you'll enjoy your time here.

Visually, it's very consistent and I really like the style of the environments and seamless implementation of the launches and landings. Sound-wise, it could be better (especially the sound of the player ship's engine), but most of the sound effects are mostly passable.

I was one of the No Man's Sky haters when the game first came out.  I was looking forward to this game, and I was really disappointed in the state that it was in when it was released. However, I watched the Internet Historian video about the game and although I had originally told myself that I would never buy this game, I decided to give it a try.  I mean, it was half off and I had heard about all of the progress that the devs had made in making the game something that was worth all the hype that it garnered years ago.

First and foremost, if you are not a fan of the Loot, Build, Loot, Upgrade game cycle, this really isn't the game for you.  but, if you are a fan of exploration and discovery, this is a great game.  

I have been obsessive about playing it and it is the first game in a while that I have been itching to play while at work.  I would say that if you are on the fence about the game, buy it.  There is so much to see.

One con: This game suffers from the same effect as Starbound.  Unlike Minecraft and Terraria, when there is so much to see, the changes you make seem to be less important.

With that all said, I love the game so far and am looking forward to learning more and building more as I go.

✅ [b]Review does Not contain spoilers. TL;DR at the bottom[/b]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[b]• Story: 5/10[/b]
The main campaign is OK but the story isn't the main attraction of this game. It's fine.

[b]• Community: 9/10[/b]
There is a fantastic passionate and friendly community around this game. 

Plus, there is an amazing mechanic in the game called ""The Anomaly"", without any spoilers, it's a mechanic in a singleplayer game but you can actually still interact with other players. 
Don't panic they can't grief you, they can't break or steal anything that you've done, or start screaming abuse at you but you can interact with random players if you want.
It's a hub where all players can visit and interact with each other, maybe go on a mission together, look at what other players are building, things they've discovered, maybe you want to trade or learn how to do something, make some friends to enjoy the game with.

Genuinely a brilliant mechanic but you can turn it off.

[b]• Difficulty: 3/10[/b]
Started off quite challenging on ""Extreme Survival"" the first couple of hours were challenging, however, progression was disappointingly easy. As in many games, there are upgrades you can find and purchase, in this game they are ""Classes""; C being the worst, then B, A, and S being the best, plus random X-class which can be worse than C or even better than S, it's completely RNG.

The issue is the best S-class upgrades are available everywhere almost immediately, it's not difficult to get resources to purchase them, and you frequently find them while looting. 
Once you have a few good upgrades the game becomes easy, I started to install mods after only 15 hours of playing to make the game more difficult. 
I haven't come close to dying or felt challenged in 400+ hours, the devs could have easily made it so rare upgrades or ships only spawn in rare systems or planets, or for completing long and difficult missions but you can have multiple uber S-class upgrades within 2 hours of playing.

[b]• Settings / Menu Options: 7/10[/b]
Disappointed there's no option to completely hide the HUD so you constantly have mission reminders popping up and health meters always visible, you can scale them to make them a bit smaller but they are still always visible.
Warning to anyone playing on an OLED monitor, do what I did and every 10-20 hours of playing change the HUD scaling to make it a little smaller or larger so it's not static in the same exact place burning into the display.

There are however a lot of customisation options for how you would like the game difficulty, unfortunately on the hardest difficulty it's still not challenging but the amount of individual customisation for how difficult or easy certain things are in the game is very good, you can really configure things to your taste.

[b]• Graphics, LOD, & Lighting: 6/10[/b]
Pretty good, a few lighting glitches here and there, and sometimes the textures can be a bit stretched on large objects but overall the visuals are pretty decent.
The game can have some really lovely and beautiful environments, you will take a lot of screenshots.

However, the biggest issue is the LOD and pop-in, the render distance is Bad! Bad enough that I searched online thinking my game was bugged.
Entire volcanoes or huge buildings will suddenly render 100m in front of you. Passed 100m everything except large rocks and a few trees stops rendering so it looks very flat and empty.
Plus the rendering can be quite delayed, it can take a few seconds to catch up so you boost forward and then 2 or 3 seconds later plants and grass start rendering.

This was on ultra settings and a high-end system, it's a limitation of the game engine and it's very immersion-breaking.

[b]• Exploration: 3/10[/b]
Technically it's near infinite but the biggest problem the game has for me is the planet generation, once you land on a new planet within 2 minutes you have seen everything that planet has to offer. 
This is the biggest disappointment of the game, you land on this alien world but you have no reason to explore it past what you can see when you land, the game presses copy, paste, copy, paste... across the whole world and every planet only has 1 biome.

In less than 15 hours played I had installed a mod called ""Better Planet Generation"" which did improve things a lot but it's still limited by the game engine.
Planet Generation needs a BIG overhaul!

[b]• Mod support: 9/10[/b]
Thankfully mod support and community are very good and active, there are thousands of amazing mods, dozens of new ones every month and it's one of the easiest games I've ever come across to mod, for people that are new to modding it's just drag and drop. 

The only downside is the game is still frequently updated by the devs, which is great but every time a game update releases it can break mods and they need to be updated, so you have to be careful about updating your game and keeping your mods up-to-date.

[b]• Bugs: 8.5/10[/b]
Really good, well polished. A few little glitches or clipping issues here and there, occasionally you might get bumped through a wall but you can just load the latest save.

[b]• Replayability & Game length: 5/10[/b]
This is difficult because it's procedurally generated so replayability and game length would be infinite but all of the recipes and core gameplay don't change, all objects are just repeated with slight tweaks or variations, so for me, this isn't a game I would replay, just one big playthrough and that's it. 
There is a lot to do, I put nearly 400 hours into one playthrough but it gets repetitive quickly.

There are Community Expeditions that I run a few times a year where you can get together with random players or solo, go on a big adventure, and earn some rare and unique rewards. A lot of our players return to the game just to play these expeditions.

[b]• Performance & fps: 9/10[/b]
Very good, no issues with framerate even on ultra settings at 4K (2160p). With an RTX 3080Ti, my framerate never dropped below 60fps. 

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]• TL;DR (Conclusion):[/b]
It's a good game that I could recommend playing. The game really has come a long way, it is now fleshed-out and has become a decent game potentially with hundreds of hours of gameplay.
The community is very friendly, passionate, and active, there's a great amount of support, mods, and open player bases, plus it's still constantly being updated by the devs.

But NMS feels like [b]quantity over quality,[/b] planet generation needs a massive overhaul it just feels dated and basic, reading online the biggest complaint players have is there is no point in exploring planets.
There are quite a few other features and mechanics that feel like the devs implemented them and then forgot about them, you put a few hours in and then you realise it's repeating and doesn't go anywhere.
It's one of the problems with procedural generation, for some things it's fantastic but it's literally repeating the same assets with little tweaks so it gets repetitive quickly.
Rather than adding new things a lot of the community is always discussing that the devs should go back and overhaul old mechanics and features, improve the planet generation, biomes, flora, and fauna, rather than adding new things, overhaul the old dated stuff that restricts the game.

It's worth playing, it's decent, however, it's an exploration game where you should be exploring unique alien planets but there's no incentive or reason to explore any of them after the first few hours.
It's vastly improved since the beginning but there's still a long way to go before this would be a great game.",1700672821,1700758804,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Many years ago, when I heard about the release of this game, I was stoked, as were most. I admittedly forgot about it for a bit until I came across it months later, and heard about how badly it flopped. I thought it was done and I'd never get to play it the way I imagined... but man, I have to say, what an epic comeback story this game is.
I saw that the game was holding on, and the developers were still working to redeem themselves. So, I waited. I waited until I couldn't wait anymore and finally, years later, decided to buy the game for my wife and I to begin together. Immediately, we were hooked.
Sure, it has its flaws. Multiplayer is amazing but complicated to set up and keep connected, but regardless of these issues, the game has so much to offer. I have been mind-blown by every planet I visit, every encounter I experience, and every new aspect of the game that I learn about.

I posted a review 2 years after launch and after putting 147 hours into the game I said the game looked promising in its 'beta-like' state, especially with the NEXT update injecting new life into the game back then. Now after another 5 years and 10 times more hours put into the game, [u]it looks fantastic and so far each update has topped the last![/u] I don't know when exactly it stopped looking like a beta, but I think that happened on Vers 4 when some QoL stuff was added along with the UI getting update for the Switch release.

Even before that, I started a serious run that so far has clocked in 800 hours of playtime! (after saying I couldn't stay interested for 30 hours at a time in the previous review) After pulling myself away from that I jumped in for as many Expeditions as I could when they cam up, giving me a taste of what the latest update had to offer. To be honest, the Expeditions are still hit or miss for people, but they are typically a great way for a new player to get a jump start into the game, if interested.

[u]Value keeps getting added to the game with no signs of slowing, and with no paid DLCs in sight[/u], so early buyers are still being rewarded (or compensated for the bad launch) to this day. That said, this game still has a lot of breadth but maybe not as much depth as some may like, but recent updates have made strides towards fixing that as well. They have made on foot combat and ship combat way more interesting over the past year or so (which were major sticking points I had early on), along with an injecting of new lore through the past couple updates.

This latest update, Echoes, is actually tempting me to either do a new serious run or restart my old one, which is saying something since I pretty much played things out after doing my 800 hour play-through.

Lastly, there are still bugs in the game, especially after an update, but typically you can avoid most of it after a week or two of waiting for the devs to clear them up. While they aren't elite code hackers, they are still very diligent and have gotten to know their creation over the years.

All in all, this game grown surprisingly well over the years, fulfilling and exceeding launch promises through the many updates, all for free and all with no signs of slowing.",1534018887,1700754979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had some reservations as I remembered all the bad reputation upon release but it seems nothing like that currently. The only bug I encountered so far is my first base being labelled an ancient ruin and honestly that's kind of funny. So I can definitely recommend this game as a space exploration rpg.

For someone who wants to explore there's so much content to discover. I haven't seen more than two systems so far and it may get repetitive or samey by the 100th system but so far so good. I haven't really gotten into starship combat as it probably works better with a controller.

It's also so great that the developers are still releasing content.

Since two days after launch, to be precise, so I've seen the game change and grow over the past five years. And I'll admit... I liked it even at the start. Just the exploration element, the infinite universe, the vastness of it all... it was compelling, even if there was technically not much to do but follow the so-called ""Atlas Path"", which was the main motivation to warp between systems, along with reaching the fabled centre of the galaxy.

For this review, which is my first one ever, I'll give a brief listed summary of how the game was at the start, followed by what has been added since, just off the top of my head, without resorting to looking at the announcements. I'm not going to list pros or cons, I'll let you decide whether the effort spent on the game in these past five years is enough to entice you.

State of the game at launch:
- Limited inventory system with no stacking for crafted items and tiny stacks for basic elements.
- NPCs permanently stuck to chairs and almost nothing in the sense of actual acknowledgement of the player in terms of movement/gestures.
- Space stations with only two small rooms with NPCs.
- No way to expand ship inventory.
- No multiplayer (remember that whole debacle?).
- Buildings with sealed-off areas that required basically unobtainable passes.
- No visible player character.
- No way of warping between systems without having to spend warp cells.
- One save slot.

Features added since launch:
- Base building with a large number of different parts and part styles.
- Exocraft (extremely useful for traversing across land quickly).
- Actual multiplayer, with crossplay and friend groups.
- Freighters (acts as a second base with unlimited power and way higher warp distances than your ship).
- Customisable player character.
- Multiple save slots.
- Hugely expanded space stations with several NPCs and upgrade stalls.
- NPCs walk around, chat to each other, show visible emotions, and gesture while talking to you.
- Once two-room Anomaly now the huge multiplayer hub of the game, featuring community missions, team missions, stalls for earning nanites, upgrade stalls, and base showcases.
- Space station/base/Anomaly portals that allow you to warp between systems/bases without spending warp cells (though you do have to spend one to access them the first time).
- Planet portals that allow you to warp to specific systems with coordinates.
- Expandable ship and freighter inventory.
- Different inventory tabs for massively improved flexibility.
- Generous crafted item stacking and very large basic element stacks.
- Previously sealed-off areas now accessible thanks to easy-to-get passes.
- Artemis storyline serving as a thorough tutorial of the game.
- Crashed freighters on planets with loot.
- Derelict freighters in space with valuable loot.
- Possible random encounters while travelling between planets.
- Creatures can be fed, ridden on, and even adopted.
- Mission stall on space stations with randomly-generated quests.
- Guild stall on space stations to get good rewards for completing missions for them.
- Cartographer stall on space stations to obtain points of interest on the current system.
- Settlements that you can manage and grow.
- Regular ""Expeditions"" that are shared by everyone and always start from a fixed point and is always online... it's complicated.
- Huge archive buildings with upgrade stalls, NPCs, a rarity exchange service, and lore.
- VR support.
- Anomalous planets that look really weird.
- Third-person view (I never use it, hence why it came across to me only now).
- Hatch your own ship from an egg.
- Full manipulation of terrain, with digging and creation of new terrain.

...well, I am sure there's other, smaller stuff that I haven't listed, but that should be about it for the big stuff.

There is some stuff that hasn't really changed between then and now, such as the trading system, the ship controls, the multi-tools (though they did add a couple more ""alien"" versions), the general style of the ships, the looks of the three major NPC alien species, the ancient ruins and monoliths, amongst other things.

I will offer a couple of tips, should you buy this game:
First, do the Artemis storyline, THEN the Atlas one. This is to avoid possible conflicts between the two main quests.
Second, you can consider yourself truly free to do what you want once you've completed the Artemis storyline.
Lastly, try to pay attention to the lore. It's in various little tidbits, from ancient ruins, to monoliths, to derelict freighters, to crashed freighters, to abandoned buildings, to archives... it's rather deep and compelling.

In conclusion, I would say the developers deserve nothing but praise for their commitment to this game after its horrendous launch. They obviously messed up and have been trying to fix things constantly ever since. That alone should deserve some sort of reward, be it awards... or constant new players. ;)

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2023
Well, two years since my review, and still they are cranking out new features and updates. So what else have they added since launch?
This time, I've had a brief look over the patch notes of the major updates, since I admittedly haven't been playing NMS all that much.

- Reworked Sentinels, with new Sentinel types, lore, structures, Sentinel-based upgrades, and the ability of having one as a pet.
- Yet more types of ship, including your own procedurally-generated Sentinel Interceptor.
- Reworked piracy system, with outlaw systems and smuggling runs.
- Squadrons, where you can recruit other fighter pilots to fight with you when in space combat.
- Heavily customisable game modes to make your save as easy or as difficult as you like.
- Dynamic difficulty, AKA adjustable difficulty within a save.
- ""Catalogue & Guide"" section with introductions to the alien factions, faction milestone progress, and all discovered pieces of lore.
- Save renaming.
- ""Wonders"" section, with records regarding treasures, planets, fauna, flora, and minerals.
- Corrupted planets and Sentinels.
- An entirely new alien faction.
- Multi-Tool salvaging.
- Freighters can now be destroyed.

They're still going, seven years after launch. I don't think any other game has had this many updates and features added over such a timespan, which is why I find it odd that it has never won a ""Labor of Love"" award. It's one game that definitely deserves it.

Maybe for its 10th anniversary... ;)",1637959170,1700743017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Base building, trade and exploration are all there. Comparisons are made with Elite, even calling NMS ""Elite-lite"" but in my opinion the two games are pitching at different elements of space simming and so comparison is somewhat unfair. 
However, there is one point Elite and NMS share and at which both excel: they offer you a sandbox world and a set of tools to make your own story and play the way YOU want to. If you suspend the element of disbelief and invest a bit of imagination, you are going to have a metric luckfoad of fun in both of them.
NMS offers base building, somewhat simplified trading system, and a greater variety of (sometimes illogical) eye candy and planet environments to explore. It is easy to sink many hours into this title. 
On top of that, the support, updates and commitment shown by Hello Games to NMS is truly fantastic and they deserve every ounce of respect they receive for it. The game keeps getting better with every iteration. It is an excellent addition to the space sim genre and deserves a spot on your shelf.

I'm truly grateful that your passions outweighed whatever the burdens of launch brought upon you, and that this game is not only alive and well but continuing to thrive and grow and expand. Studios like yours give me hope for an industry that seems to be shifting more and more towards greed. I know this game didn't start off optimally, but where it is at now and where it continues to go with the consistent and substantial free updates has more than redeemed itself and in my opinion it belongs in my personal video game hall of fame.

The above specs is not enough to run the game seamlessly apparently. The game stutters, freezes, FPS drops, and sometimes outright crashes. 

That being said, even after trying out all the fixes without success and endless frustration cos the game just won't run smoothly, I still didn't ask for a refund. Why? Because the game is everything that I want in a game. I love to explore. I love to hoard materials, I love to discover and build and collect. I enjoy the odd bit of survivability that's just enough to make you feel like you have to manage stuff to survive, but not enough to detract from the main focus of the game, namely exploration. 
I could do with some more customisation options for the ships, but for the most part, the game is in a very good place. Now please check the performance and stability. HG has done a lot of good upgrades over the years and I'm sure its  a matter of time before they get it right.

Update mid November 2022:
Is this even the same game?  Massive updates. This last update has cause some re-thinking (not enough to restart a new toon). much easier to add / remove tech for buildouts. Less OP here and there. Visually, has gotten even better looking.

Update to update, there was more interesting to see and do, but it's always reverted to kind of a zen diversion.  The expeditions are a really nice addition, and they should build on that.  For $30 it's got a solid base of players, plenty to see that hasn't been seen (though too much repetition--HG, we need an exploration / variability update to get more real oddness in here), and honestly it's a nice change of pace from time to time.  Are there bugs I still want to see squashed?  Sure.  Are there features that need tweaking or overhauls?  Yeah.  But this is a nice time to jump in if you haven't before.

I was so hyped to play with my best friend and explore worlds together. But it came out and everything wasn't as it seemed. Years went by and I didn't hear much about the game, until I saw Next. Actual multiplayer was being added. I was still iffy on the game as I was still soured by the disappointment. 

More time passed and more updates were added, but I hadn't really thought about NMS until I saw a video on YT. It covered all the troubles the developers had, and how they still persisted updating NMS. I still didnt buy it, but it was almost always in the back of my mind. 

Smash cut to the beginning of 2022 and i buy it from the Winter Sale. It felt great to play, like playing Minecraft for the very first time. And then within a month or 2 Sentinel dropped and added more content, and I kept playing. By that time I had convinced my bast friend to get it, and I was brought back to that time when my friend and I were hyped to play together in NMS. Finally it happened. And although there is still some stuff I wish was in the game, they're still adding to it. 

Just this year they added Sentinel (ground combat overhaul), Outlaws (space combat overhaul), Endurance (Freighter overhaul), and Waypoint (general overhaul). They still have pledged to add more and I cant wait to see whats next in store. They definitely deserve the labor of love award for 2022 for sticking with their game.

Even better, you can tell the devs care because they're taking advantage of Apple's Metal API. This game runs great on my 2023 MacBook Pro with the M2 Pro chip. Thank you guys!!

Update: I started playing again when the NEXT update came out. Holy crap, this is a totally different beast than when it first came out 2 years ago. I've put so many hours into it already. I was hoping that it would get fixed and it did in the end. There are some glitches and multiplayer isn't exactly fleshed out but damn, I trust that they will continue to make this game better and better.

Once I get the game that is shown to me in the trailers I will be happy. I want the build of the game that was demoed at all the conventions and all the interviews. We were lied too, I'm hopeful that Hello Games will update the game to reflect on what was promised and shown to everyone. I don't even care that it may never be multiplayer. This would have been a solid game if we had just gotten what was shown in the trailers. 

Factions? What factions? Epic space battles? Come on, Star Wars X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter had better flight controls that this game. You don't even see the outposts shown in the gameplay videos. Everything is just one big grind at some point. I was hopeful for something epic at the center of the galaxy.

--EDIT--
Although it is not my absolute favourite game in general, it is, by now, the one on Steam (that I own). I've gone back to it at least once or twice a year. It's still an 8/10, because some things are stiff and scripted very clearly, but like GW1/2, there's just nothing else quite like it. That feeling of landing anywhere on a planet, fairly seamlessly, of unlimited exploration and freedom in a vast multiverse... the power to build what I want, where I want, even on a planet hell-bent of killing me.

I can safely say I’m hooked thus far.

Landing on a new planet and never really being sure what to expect is a unique feeling I haven’t experienced in gaming for a long time. I think if you have a good imagination you will love this game. There’s a multiplayer element that’s not focal to the main game (right now) but just the knowledge that there are others like you out exploring this vast vast universe is in a strange way comforting. 

The game just looks stunning, the hardest part is trying NOT to stop and take screenshots every 5 minutes. 

If you liked Elite Dangerous but found it a bit too complicated at times this might be right up your street. It simplifies many of the elements that are in that game (landing/missions/crafting etc) and the planetary exploration is just leaps and bounds above Elite in my opinion.

I’m aiming to get the storyline completed and see where that takes me. Perhaps after that, the repetitiveness will set in, but if this game continues to be supported as it has been in the last year then I for one am extremely excited where we go from here.

Happy Travelling!

They added content update after content update to add life to the universe they created. Quite literally, breathing new life into the game. Honestly, one of the best wholesome comeback stories a developer/publisher could do. This game is unrecognizable to this day to what was initially released.

It did a complete 180 from where is was at release in 2016 and is still well worth the 60 dollar price tag since the developers are regularly putting out massive, high quality updates, with the current features pretty much surpassing what the developers initially promised from the game. The game from my experience right now does not seem filled with bugs, other than the periods of time right after a major content drop when new patches are needed. The multiplayer experience is decent, with the ability to play with a small group of friends in your party and to encounter other people at random in star systems and the nexus multiplayer hub. Probably one of the best features of the updates to the game are the base building tools which allow you to build your own base on alien planets with a great deal of creativity and a part list that is ever growing. Also of note is the ever growing roster of unique spaceships to hunt down and grow your fleet with new different vessels being added over time such as organic starships, flyable sentinel starships, and solar sail ships.

Quick Summary

Pros:
- Amazing experience of an infinite universe
- Great base building mechanic
-Good mix of flying through space and walking/driving on planets
- Everything is procedural which makes for plenty of new and unique ships, planets, and aliens
- A good mix of space sim and resource management survival
-Decent cross platform multiplayer
- Regular high quality updates that are 100% free
- Regular expeditions which provide a new time limited adventure to play through every few months

Cons:
- A bit expensive (maybe wait until its on-sale which it frequently is)
- grinding is needed for credits and resources (but not worse than most resource and building oriented games)
-Major updates often come with bugs when they are first released.
(Edit)
-Admittedly after over 400 hours the procedural generation can get less interesting, but for the price you can easily get at least 100+ hours out of the game, and expect to hop back on to experience every major update.

The dev really love this game. Great dedication to their dream.

I'm not much of an explorer, more of a builder. But I had fun with the exploration trying to find good spot for making a production base. Also, this game let me own a whole fleet with freighter as the flagship and about 30 other escort that ain't just cosmetic. You can land on it, there's a repair quest sometime. You can send them on expedition getting resources. The game let me build huge factory and based too. The freighter interior is customizable and can be useful too. With processing machine, plant farms, storage, etc..

I wish they would remove the limit of number of object per save. Or let us change it in the config/setting to allow unlimited.
There's already a check that if the base is too complex it won't be available to multiplayer. But at least I want it for just myself.

This year felt more scattered than previous years. More updates focused on platforms vs content. But overall an awesome year again. Still no charge for all the extra content given out which is mind blowing over 7 years later. Amazing game and at this point more than worth the price. It is starting to feel like we are reaching the end of new content or maybe I just can't think of anything new I would love to have in the game. Still amazing and I am getting close to 2,000 hours of play time. Probably a sign you should give it a shot if you haven't.....

UPDATE: It Is now November 2022 and the Expedition Replays have started. This year was a bit rocky with the community, but it is still the best game I have played. The Waypoint 4.0 update changed a lot of fundamentals, which people hated. I think they were needed changes that benefit the game. The only thing that worries me is that this was the first update in a very long time that felt unfinished, like it was incomplete but they had a deadline to meet. More issues / bugs than normal were reported and also features added in after the fact in a patch ( super charge slots ) feels like they didn't have time to finish it so they released it knowing that within the month it would be done. Who knows what that means, but it was a stumble from an amazing studio. Maybe they have finally met the limitation of the size of their team, with working on a Switch version and PSVR2 while creating a big overhaul update. I just hope they get rest over the holidays and 2023 is back to amazing updates.

UPDATE: It is now April 2022 and we have just had 2 combat updates, one for on foot combat and the most recent for space combat. This game keeps getting better and better. We are on our 20th FREE update. If you are on the fence then jump in, you will probably love the game. 

UPDATE: It is now November of 2021 and there are now 18 FREE updates for this game. If this isn't the best come back story then I have no idea what is. If you are thinking of getting it JUST DO IT!!!

Original Review:

I have played since the NEXT update on Xbox One and fell in love. The fact that they have been updating for the past 3 years ( at the time of review ) and everything has been for free is a testament to how much they love their community. Is it perfect? No. Does it keep getting better with every update? YES!


If you are into survival crafting games then give this a whirl. There is some basic story stuff that will walk you through the basics and give you 15 hours or so of directional content. After that it is all up to you. Think Minecraft with a universe to travel and a ton to explore and build.

...is an exploration and crafting survival game. Waking up on an unknown planet with no memory of your past and a crashed spacecraft with cryptic or fragmentary information, you set out to survive the environment and explore the Euclid Galaxy one planet at the time, as you define your purpose. This review takes into all updates up until Echos.

[h1]⚙ [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] ⚙[/h1]
Gameplay is focused on gathering resources and crafting objects. You begin with a basic multitool and limited inventory space, and learn to mine for crafting material to fix your equipment and recharge your life-support and hazard protection shields. As you progress, you'll learn recipes to more advanced components to build devices, refine basic elements, craft equipment upgrades for your multitool, exosuit and spacecraft, and even build a base (or multiple bases).

Much of [i]No Man's Sky[/i] revolves around exploring and cataloguing all you discover. Scanning each mineral, flora and fauna found on each planet will identify the resource it supplies as well as give you Units (trade currency) for each you scan for the first time, while uploading them to the servers will give you Nanites (tech currency). Units can be used to purchase material and components from the Galactic Trade Network, as well as better multitools, spacecrafts and frigates. Nanites are used to purchase equipment blueprints and upgrade modules. A third currency called Quicksilver, used for character aesthetics or decorative crafting items, can be gained from missions on the Anomaly, a multiplayer hub from which you can meet with players, show off your starships, go on missions together and visit each other's bases.

Progression is done in multiple ways. After the introduction (which also serves as a tutorial), you can follow the Path of Atlas which sets you to eventually reach the center of the galaxy. You may instead set your focus on the single-player campaign where you retrace the footsteps of another Traveler like you. Of course, you can ignore both options and advance at your own pace, finding alternative ways to unlock the game's content. For instance, you can unlock base building component blueprints from buried salvage technologies and from side-missions given to you by your in-base specialists. Once you have a freighter, your crew will give you missions for your fleet of frigates (which you send on exploration, trading or combat missions). Those seeking a bigger challenge can do all that in Survival or Permadeath modes.

[h1]☺ [u]What I enjoyed[/u] ☺[/h1]
It's hard to express just how much there is to do in this game! In the early game, your limited equipment and inventory space will force you to struggle through a slow progression, but the entry grind has a satisfaction of its own once you acquire additional cargo space to store spare consumable and specialized material, upgrade your multitool and exosuit with a variety of weapon modules, better shields, enhanced environmental protection and various specialized equipment. Once you accumulate a good reserve of Units, trading your spacecraft for a bigger, stronger or faster one will only accelerate the process.

Base building is also very satisfying if you're into this. You can build anywhere, and the base's size cap is very high. The base can serve as headquarters with additional storage space, a farm to produce rare material, a gathering place for you your friends (the base itself can be built as a team), build racing tracks for use with your exocrafts (land vehicles you can, of course, build and upgrade!) or a wondrous piece of art (complete with logic-based wired lighting and ByteBeat musical creations). Getting a freighter (from which you control your fleet and store multiple spacecrafts) serves as a mobile base of its own, part of which you can alter and build in to your liking.

It's a gorgeous game, the constant updates since launch brought improvements to textures, procedural generation algorithms, fauna and flora diversity, and overall graphical technology upgrades. You never know what the next planet will be like: A low-gravity barren wasteland? Icy mountains with orange skies and pink waters? A hellscape of erupting volcanos, firestorms, and lightning striking the ground? A poisonous marsh of giant fungi and carnivorous plants? A paradise world with glow-in-the-dark purple grass and green night sky? Or perhaps deep oceans of radioactive muck and meteor showers where the atmosphere filters the color spectrum to exclusive yellow tints? New creature types, from small to humongous, can be found on these, once again proceedurally-generated from head to toe, with actual per-planet coherence.

[h1]☹ [u]What bothered me[/u] ☹[/h1]
As mentioned before, it's a game about resource-gathering and crafting. This means a lot of grind, hour upon hour of mining and refining your resources. Want to build a huge base? Grind for building material. Want to make a lot of money? Grind for valuable resources. Want to survive a hostile environment? Grind for life support and environmental protection fuel. If you don't enjoy this kind of stuff, you will find it terribly tedious. The change of pace from story missions, base building missions and sidequest missions are limited as they can also feel very repetitive, even with the efforts made by the developers with the week-long community events.

PvP and PvE combat mechanics, whether on the ground or in space, are less than optimal. The ingredients all appear to be there: various weapon types and grenades for ground, various weapon types and missiles for space, the run/strafe/jump mechanics, yet somehow it still feels off and doesn't even come close to games dedicated to either types of combat. So while you ""can"" be a pirate and fight frigates, or you ""can"" be a hunter fighting predators and sentinels, it's barely worth the trouble and seems to have been included as an afterthought. 

The single-player campaign is somewhat simple and feels like a goose chase of traveling from one location to another, grinding, digging or building specific upgrades to continue to the next clue. Learning the alien languages, one word at a time, has little payoff. Most of the galaxy lore, given through snippets of history found in monoliths or conversations with stationary NPCs, will feel superficial to anyone who doesn't want to do the roleplaying in their head. If you can't set your own objectives, you will get bored after a while.

[h1][b]My Verdict[/b]: ★★★★☆ - [i]""Next on your list!""[/i][/h1]

[i]No Man's Sky[/i] isn't a space combat simulator, nor a sci-fi adventure: it is first and foremost an exploration and crafting survival game, somewhere between [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110][i]ARK: Survival Evolved[/i][/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710]Subnautica[/url]. However, a lot of people are looking for a game that does just that. You'll find a lot to do, it isn't even humanly possible to discover the entire galaxy (even if all players worked together in an attempt to do so). With all the updates so far and those to come, it definitely delivers!

[quote][b]P.S.[/b]: I was lucky enough to avoid the pre-launch hype, but I do understand the disappointment and frustration caused by Hello Games' marketing, promising features that wouldn't actually make it in the game until years from launch. And while I can appreciate the dedication of the team not to have run away with the money and actually delivering on their promises, I would beware about pre-purchasing their games in the future.[/quote]

Get lost exploring many gorgeous worlds, though arguably even with procedural generation the diversity could be improved upon. Set up cozy homes, imposing bases or simply both with the expansive building menu. Find your absolute dream ship and add it to your ever-growing collection or do some questing for a bit of action here and there. And once one is done with all that take a breather and just enjoy the great community in the multiplayer hub where there is always a friendly face to find that is willing to help newcomers out.

Instead of the backlash that happenend people would've seen vanilla NMS as the foundation for what was to come from the beginning, Personally I've always greatly enjoyed the game despite it's early flaws but I would certainly never say the backlash wasn't justified even if it was, in true internet fashion, wildly exagerated. 
For me, while vanilla always felt like an alpha version, it was still somehow enjoable enough if you went into with a certain mindset. Specifically with a couple of good beers, some beautiful music (at least after you had your fill of 65days' fantastic dynamic soundtrack) and maybe a slightly tired mnd. It could be a very relaxing, almost meditative experience like that. It was a walking sim on a galactic level if you will and a good way to end a stressful day. Just flying from planet to planet, looking around for rare metals and crashed ships and maybe get the occasional glimpse of the very weird but intriguing lore the game had on offer was sometimes exactly what I needed in my day. I've put a good 50 hours into ithe vanilla version, which is a lot for someone like me, and at least after I had increased my inventory capacity I can't say I was often frustrated or angry on my journey to the center of the galaxy. It was still a grind mind you but since there weren't really any high stakes, farming resources to get more money and scanning planets for hours to find that crashed ship with the bigger inventory that I wanted was simply a reason to explore for a bit more. 
I shut my ears to the backlash and tried my very best to enjoy what was there and ended up enjoying myself immensely.

Fast forward two years and that weird little alpha game that half the wold seemed to hate has become something else and something much closer to what was initally promised. While it is still a grindy and weird game, there's so much to do beyond that. There's good reasons now to spend hours of your time looking for that one damn resource you still need and there are plenty of interesting things that will inevitably happen on the way. You can set your own goals, like farming, decking out your gear, becoming the commander of an armada, trading, bounty hunting, base building, etc or you can follow the strange trail of the atlas to flesh out the lore, figure out who Artemis and null are and what the nature of this universe is while the story guides you through a clear path through countless systems. And if you need a break from what you're doing, just go do something else for a while.
There's so much to accomplish and all of it feels so much more fleshed out now; It's quite an incredible turnaround. If you're willing to go with the flow and learn how to work with the game and its systems it will likely be a very rewarding journey indeed. And if you're ever in trouble you can now even call for a friend in multiplayer.
And now, on top of all that, there's also a mostly fully featured VR mode.

All of that is just scratching the surface of what this gigantic universe has in store. No Man's Sky is a very odd and huge little game and even now it can be infuriating at times, but with the right mindset it's a relaxing, peaceful and very unique experience. I can't help but love it for that. And with their continued support through updates Hello Games have proven that they're not just in it for the money but that they're trying their damndest to make No Man's Sky a great game yet.
I think they're well on their way..",1478217584,1700670129,True,11,0,0.499276041984558105,0,True,False,False

Embark on an interstellar journey in ""No Man's Sky,"" a game that transcends traditional boundaries to offer an expansive universe brimming with alien planets, peculiar creatures, and galaxies stretching beyond the horizon. More than a mere game, it's a comprehensive cosmic odyssey. It begins with your struggle for survival on a treacherous alien world and soon escalates to navigating starships across the vastness of space, where new planets await and the potential for crossing paths with other adventurers is ever-present.

The ambition of No Man's Sky is unparalleled—a sandbox of galactic proportions set within a procedurally generated universe housing quintillions of distinctive planets. Each celestial body teems with its own ecosystems, creating a sense of scale and exploration that is virtually unmatched in the gaming landscape.

Stranded on an obscure planet with a broken ship and limited resources, you're faced with the ultimate test of survival. The game's beauty lies in its reluctance to coddle you; instead, it encourages a bold spirit of discovery, pushing you to learn, adapt, and eventually master the elements.

As you traverse the cosmos, you'll engage with diverse alien species, each offering unique languages to decipher, intricate trading systems to navigate, and rich lore to unravel.

Base building and crafting are cornerstones of your journey, providing a canvas for both architectural genius and utilitarian functionality. The crafting system is a complex playground that rewards ingenuity, allowing for the creation of everything from basic survival tools to elaborate starship enhancements.

Combat is a thrilling challenge, whether you're repelling space pirates in cosmic dogfights or outwitting mechanical Sentinels on unforgiving planets. The thrill of battle is a constant companion in the wilds of space.

Despite its tumultuous launch marked by bugs and unmet expectations, Hello Games has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround. Through relentless updates, they've woven additional layers of depth that have significantly enhanced the game's immersive experience.

To conclude, No Man's Sky is a monumental testament to the beauty of scale and ambition in gaming. It's a labor of love that has blossomed into an odyssey igniting the spark of exploration at every turn.

This isn't just a game—it's an adventure, a lesson, and a canvas for creativity. It's a homage to our innate curiosity and the eternal human yearning to explore the unknown. I give it a 9/10, for it has redefined what it means to get lost among the stars.

2019: Added support for VR. THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE PC GAME OF ALL TIME.

THANK YOU HELLO GAMES FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE GAME EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

Even though there is a lot of controversy surrounding this game I still like it. It's the closest thing to what I want to play and the closest thing to one of my biggest dreams - explore the universe, catalog everything I find, befriend anyone I encounter, have my own base on a wonderful planet, have my own ship, fly FTL etc. 

To the people who cry that the game has no gameplay - the gameplay is what you make it. It's like one of those many survival games on Steam but actually done right. If you are into space stuff, sci-fi etc., this game is for you, if you ever dreamed of being a space explorer, this is for you. If you are looking for action-packed shooter, you probably won't find it here.

Mods fix lots of issues with the game which should have been fixed by the devs. They also enhance the gameplay and visuals significantly.
I recommend using the mods made by Lo2k on nexusmods for the best results.",1502879014,1700668068,True,9,0,0.554497241973876953,0,True,False,False

1. like space games
2. like/prefer simplified realism or a fantasy take on space and the universe
3. either are into exploration, trading, taming animals, fleet management, flying/finding cool ships, combat, crafting, farming or building (I'm probably missing something)

I have played a lot, and will continue to because there are so many things that make this game such an amazing experience!

Firstly, the game itself is exactly what I love! Space exploration combined with base building and a nice story.
With the procedural generation, it makes it continuously exciting to explore and find the perfect systems, I love the variety there is on planets, and with what can be created.
Some bases can be truly amazing! NMS also has so many more wonderful aspects inside that keep enhancing this experience.

Next, Hello Games are amazing developers! With constant free game-changing updates, it keeps the excitement.
NMS had a rocky start, but Sean and his team have delivered tenfold, are continuing to do so and I cant wait to see where the game continues to go!

Finally, the community is by far the best. So many positive creators and members, it's a true pleasure to be a part of it! (If you need some NMS guides go check out Jason Plays on YT, an amazing and helpful guy!)

The release of Starfield and paired with recent watching of one of my fav movies (Interstellar) actually made me want to go buy NMS for a 3rd time. So I looked up the biggest updates that have come out since my exile only to learn that there is so much content that has been added and many aspects have been improved from quality of life to multiplayer interaction to planet procedural generation. I was stunned when I explored one planet where the only living ""animal"" on the surface was a floating, transparent orb....that I could milk....and keep as a pet......and named him Frank

Also there's something to be said about the extraordinary feeling of going from space to a planet's surface with no loading screen.

About 4 Years ago, Sean Murray from Hello Games promised me giant Sandworms on the planets in the game he was making. It was promised in one of their pre-launch trailers. I bought the game after some deliberation, mostly because I wanted to see the giant Sandworms. They where my trigger, my selling point.

The game released. It was all a fiasco and a horrible mess. There where no worms, small or large. And the game was missing many other things. I still played it. After all I had some fun, and got some nice screenshots. But it was not what was promised. This was worming me deep inside since then. A feeling of betrayal and broken promises. I did not write a review back then.

Since back when I played the game on launch, it got many updates. I was surprised and liked what I saw on improvements over the years. But it was not enough to bring me back to the game, or heal the deep wound inside, even if the game got a lot better, and some of the broken promises got patched in.

But now No Man's Sky got its Origins Update to version 3.0
Now Sean Murray delivered to me what he promised me.

[b]GIANT SANDWORMS ARE ROAMING THE PLANETS OF NO MANS SKY![/b]

I will have to return to the game now, and watch the giant worms.

Sean Murray, is forgiven.
The wound is healed.
The worms have arriven.
I fly again.


Thank you Hello Games.
You earned yourself my positive review now.

The game is not everyone's cup of tea, there are a lot of exploring loops, but beautifully crafted, interesting and unknown planets, buildings, ships and many more things will make it worth. There are many times I just got off my ship in awe for what I discovered.
There are a lot of walking and scanning and buying and selling and similar mechanics and game is definitely a tad frustrating at times but all of the above become more organic as you play and they integrate in how you want to play the game in your pace.
Base building is a bit bare bone compared to similar games, but you can surely build something to your liking. Aaaah, [b]devs[/b] please [u]stop[/u] people from building in view distance of your base (ruining your view with an unfinished ugly structure or blocking the view).
Game probably doesn't worth full price to me, there are a large amount of quality of life things missing, but this means if devs keep improving the game, it can go places. 8/10.

P.s. 312 hours of game play later!
A new very improved base was built, and the new upgrades to base building are super good, it gives the player so many options.
A new settlement was acquired and ""max"" tier'd, when you are done with improving the settlement, it lacks follow up contents but Devs didn't disappoint so far, so I believe in them on this.
I never got around to do the expeditions, but thankfully Hello Games let us do them again. First of all, thank you very much Devs! Furthermore, first expedition is going great so far and I'm having a blast.

Dang, Still Updating and Defeated Starfield to be Best Space Exploration Game!

[25 April 2020]
You know what, Well Done Hello games, I really Love this game. You keep updating this game, more content, More fun. i heard You guys have plan for 2020 with this game, i hope dev keep updating the content and improving the gameplay. 

Alright, So theres 11 Updates so far. The Beyond Update just make me really happy, atleast the game have more content, but now the recent updates the exo mech, this game is more fun than ever. 

This Game have a quantillion Planet that you can explore. you can find the lush ""Earth-like"" planet or Exotic planet with weird things on the planet. but good luck find those planet, you'll busy exploring which planet will be your home. 

And then the content. you can build a Space Colony Camp or Ordinary Building. theres so many type of Spaceship and Capital Ship. Few Planetary Vehicle etc.

So Many Flora and Fauna you can find here, scan it and save to your database. fun it is. 

8.5/10!

[29 July 2019]
Well done for Hello Games they Release The Multiplayer now,Atlas Rises Update already make my Thumbs Up. For me this game is fun,Crafting,meet new alien scanning Creatures,its good. The UI,gameplay,control are great

Well, My Complaints are the optimization and Game Logic. Optimization is still bad, For Example, Its like High I got 30fps and Low i still got 30FPS,Stuttering, FPS Drop, And Not smooth at all,even i turn on the vsync and Cap 30 FPS. My PC is average,i should get Smooth Decent FPS with Decent Graphics. 

Game Logic or animation or whatever it call. on TPP, the animation of the characther is funny. Its feel not finished,Its Choppy and  i rather switch to FPP instead. and yeah it affect the camera angle to characther. but overall Game logic for this type of game are alright.

Overall, the Issues that faced me isnt Really Ruined My Gameplay,im okay with this State of the otimization. For me 30FPS its alright, it still run Right? (well i should get Higher). Graphics are good. Gameplay good. now have multiplayer,u can hangout with friend,meet another player,etc. new content new everything. I Hope They release the next patch/update for new content,Better Optimization and better game mechanics/logic

Exploration for exploration's sake then you might enjoy this game.  The fact that VR is being added to this game (freely) is why I am purchasing a Steam Index and significantly upgrading my machine.  I cannot wait to experience what new (free) updates are added to the game in the future.

I stand by my positive review of No Man's Sky now that I have had the opportunity to experience the VR version of the game via the Valve Index.  There are certainly tweaks that could improve the overall game experience including adding greater variability to planets, creatures, and spaceships.  Hello Games has announced another significant (free) update to the game which provide some quality of life improvements.  Would recommend to gamers who enjoy open world games, are not looking for linear (or much of any) story-telling elements, enjoy creative base-building mechanics, and a quasi-MMO experience with varying degrees of interaction with other players.

BUT the devs never stopped improving and growing, and it really shows in the version of the game that exists today.  There is much to do, and much to explore, and much to build.  I quickly got hooked, and spent a lot of time just bumming around the galaxy.  My only complaint is that the starbases and buildings quickly become repetitive due to each of them having an identical layout.  That takes away from the feeling that you are exploring vastly different corners of the galaxy. Combat is also limited, but that is clearly not the main point of this game. When VR dropped, it was awesome to be able to pop my rift on an see everything from an entirely new perspective.  If you like exploring and building, buy now!

Update 11/28/20: These guys are still adding content to this game. I pick it up every few months, and the updates make it feel new and exciting all over again.  Even more enjoyable with the larger variety of tasks, and planets feel more rich and populated than in earlier versions.  Still buy it!

Update 12/1/2021: Still giving us updates! Still improving and growing. So many ways to play the game now. Truly a labor of love. Thank you, Hello Games.

Old review:

Kind of reminds me of Batman:Arkham Knight release. Very bad PC port. Major stuttering, FPS drops... This is my first expensive game I decided to buy and im not satisfied. I should have waited for the pirated version and checked it out first...

Day 3 edit: 
Okay, so aside from these performance issues, lets talk gameplay. I still stand by my first review. The gameplay is dull. I was in awe for the first 3-4 planets. Then the repetition kicked in. The planets, as a whole, are different. Different color, different size, different ""texture"". The flora is pretty much the same. They are slightly different, after 10 planets you will be missing plants because you will think you scanned it already. Animals are what kept me smiling the longest. They are goofy, funny looking and derp-walking around, which is nice, but still after a while you can see the similarity between them. The only thing that is keeping me attached to this game is the language and the mistery behind the center. I want to gather as much alien language as I can and then proceed to the center. But every playthrough I literaly have to make myself play it, because when I start playing everything comes down to:
1. Shift... Q... Space... C... Repeate.
2. OOh, green question mark, and its only within 2mins of walking. *heads towards it*
3. Save, craft those pesky chips, discover some monoliths, signals, Drop ins, etc...
4. See first step and implement the second.
5. After 2hrs of that I get bored and rage ALT+F4.
6. After 15mins I come back because i didnt find those 2 remaining signals on that planet.
7. Play for another 1hr, 1hr and a half... For nothing. Rage leave the planet.
8. Travel to the Space Station, sell items, gaze upon couple of alien ships, realize i dont have money to buy that thruster let alone the entire ship. Get motivated.
9. Land on the next planet.
10. See steps 1-9...

-Update: Day 9
I give up... I'll be back when they, and if they implement some new features to the game. This is just plain boring for me. Repetition is not my genre.

They dumped this game. No hopes.
Update: I guess i was wrong, something more might come from this. This foundation update is promising, they wrote that this is the one of many upcoming free updates. I would like to see them turn this for the better.",1471082786,1700629582,True,0,1,0.501072943210601807,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended for the people who enjoy turning off their brain to explore the cosmos in a myriad of ways, as well as those who want to just be the lunatic with a laser. Grab a pet, some explosives, and go explore the universe, you fancy spacecase!
...or is that just me?

Now with a cool robot player-unlockable species!

Pros:
-Base building, pets, ships, weapons, friends, and more to collect, work towards, and search for in a ""Just one more"" checklist to improve your exploration of the universe.
-Fantastic, if not potentially seizure-risking, visuals from varieties of worlds with different atmospheres affecting the colors, to your usual simple pleasures of flashy pew-pews in space.
-Almost everything is optional, base building, questing, etc. are yours to chase as you please as the only real pressure to do anything is in the name of progress/survival if you so choose... BUT you skip the survival failure of having to feed/water yourself like a child with an instant metabolism!

Cons:
-The bigger the game, the larger the odds of a bug, so with great exploration comes great fails... NPCs or you go MIA as the floor decides it doesn't exist anymore, assets missed in QA squeeze into live play that aren't ready when a RNG spawn triggers, and the usual bugs any random-gen loading can cause. The support team rarely replies to issues, so be aware of your last auto-save as you play.(Exiting your ship triggers auto-saves.)
-You can build a base, customize your character, and install upgrades to your gear/vehicles as you choose but.... no customizing anything else. Your gun/tool, ships, etc. are reliant on finding the combination of parts you want and getting lucky. To some this is a hard pass, to others it's part of the exploration, but I'm gonna put it out there as a soft negative because of the split in opinion. PERSONALLY, I think it's a bit weak to have a canon scrapping system to get sellable parts, but not have kit-building options, for those concerned there are ways to narrow your search but it'll still be exploration grind.
-Although everything is mostly optional, there's a good number of faults within the ""quests"" that can be found if just the wrong action is taken, and co-op play tends to bug things out if you want to play story together, essentially making it ""Multiplayer capable"",  but not the best idea when doing lore-based questing.
-DO NOT START THE GAME IN CO-OP, something about the starting tutorial will lock up when done with a team active, it's best to play solo until you've reached the multiplayer hub, unless you want some of those tutorial quests stuck in your tab forever.",1654649948,1700628502,True,3,0,0.537537515163421631,0,True,False,False

Oh boy, this is gonna be a long one.

When No Man's Sky initially released back in 2016, I tried to refund it. I felt betrayed - Not only was it missing a lot of promised content, but it was also vehemently buggy and felt just half-baked. Planets felt dull and boring, animals were mediocre and didn't add much to the experience, and it all around didn't feel like there was much to even do in the first place.

Of course, my luck being what it is, my refund didn't go through, so I decided to just swallow the pill I'd been given and kept it in my inventory. 

Over time, the game began to get updates - Foundation. Pathfinders. Atlas Rises. NEXT completely turned the game on its head, almost completely redesigning the game from the ground up. Abyss. Visions. Beyond took what made NEXT so great and expanded upon it (and gave us VR support, which is always welcome!). As the list of updates grew, I found myself slowly but surely coming back to it more and more. 

I didn't realize it at the time, but [b]I witnessed this game dig itself out of its own grave.[/b] I watched this game go from the butt of every gaming joke at the time to an actually beloved title in people's libraries. 

Fast forward to now, No Man's Sky sits at a Very Positive rating, something I never thought I'd see when I saw it release. As for personal statistics, at the time of writing, No Man's Sky is the 3rd most played game in my library with 708 hours played. 

I've kind of hesitated writing this review as I can't exactly put it into words all that well, so I'll at least try. Let me start with the elephant in the room:

[h2]No Man's Sky has been massively improved in all aspects, but still suffers from feeling shallow - and I feel that no amount of content will improve on it.[/h2]


Maybe it's because I'm burnt out - 708 hours is a long time for a game like this, long enough for someone like me to do just about everything the game offers. Planets have improved terrain (though that's still kind of up for debate - I personally feel planets pre-NEXT had more unique terrain, but to each their own on that front) but I can't help but still feel that mediocre slog that I felt all the way back in 2016. There's much more to do now, but it feels like if you do it once, you don't really need to do it again unless you want to grind for certain items. 

Despite all this, I find myself just booting up the game and exploring, maybe catching the occasional photo or two. Kind of ironic, considering that's more or less what No Man's Sky originally sold itself to be - an exploration game at its core with everything else tacked onto it over time. It's like the video game equivalent of a warm blanket to me - Sometimes I just want to wrap up in it, grab a warm drink, put on a nice video and get lost wandering around a planet that feels all too familiar compared to the last.

Most of those 708 hours have been exactly that, and honestly for that alone it gets my positive rating. It's [b]far[/b] from perfect, but it has provided a kind of entertainment I don't think many other games have achieved in my eyes. 

Earlier in this review I said my luck was bad. Thinking about it, maybe my luck isn't nearly as bad as I thought it was - just took some time to come back around is all.",1700622683,1700622745,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Edit: The latest update kinda messed up the game for me. I get that things change, but I wish they had been a little upfront about what was going to happen so we could prepare for it.

After waiting years and years the game is finally better and I am confident to say I enjoy No Mans Sky. Some may argue it is still a walking simulator, but the game itself has little to do with walking and more about exploration. This is what brings the game to life, not just the unique settings, but the unique creatures and objectives that are presented. Starfield, upon release, posed a significant threat to the game. But as more people were informed of its existence and reminded of the game, the player count reached a total not seen in months. I was even able to get my friends to play, albeit they don't enjoy the game as much as me. For those who are looking for a unique experience, look no further to No Mans Sky. It is the epitome of space exploration, and it keeps on giving. Honestly one of my favourite games on steam.

If you did find this review helpful, please consider buying the game. The developers rely on the money they get on each update to keep providing free content for the community, so the more people play, the more things can be added to fully fuel the potential of No Mans Sky.

Sometimes the music is so chilled and symphonic when roaming space or the new grounds that follow, and other times you are fighting for your tiny interloper life against a walker and his mech friends by tunneling underground like a mole and the soundtrack is right there with you.

Only thing that's missing from the PC version are the really fun haptic stuff they did on the PS5 with the dualsense, I am always coming back to this game, I wouldn't call it a space adventure, more like a peaceful space odyssey.

One thing to consider is at the beginning you can feel overwhelmed by the various mechanics: sometimes I had to read and search for info on internet but nothing discouraging.

[b]SPOILERS! (kind of)[/b]

Playing No Man's Sky is one big incredible journey, after which you're left with so many fun memories.

Like going through black hole into some new star system and land on some planet that is 90% water, or has raging blizzards every 10 minutes, or makes everything around black and white and red, or just full of geometrical shapes.
Or landing on derelict frigate where temperature is so low, your hazard support doesn't last for even a minute, so you have to hop from one heater to another while searching the ship for some loot.
Or buying ships in space stations just to scrap them and sell all upgrade modules for some sweet sweet nanites.
Or even better, randomly finding some amazing crashed S-class ship and slowly fixing it up, part by part.
I loved going to pirate controlled systems and just annihilating every single frigate I see for precious frigate modules/upgrades and also ridiculous amount of money. Or just buying all of the contraband and selling it in for the crazy profit in the next system.
Although, buying tons of parts for cheap in one system and selling it for +50% profit in another (effectively crashing economy of both) was fun too.
I loved camping in some building while destroying waves of sentinels, including the walker, cause they are stupid dumb-dumbs that lose me the moment door closes.
I hate multiplayer part in any game, but here it was so seamless and fitting, I didn't care at all. I even liked to go to the Space Anomaly, just to dump some valuable parts on some unsuspecting player and run off.

[b]HUGE SPOILERS FOR THE PLOT!![/b]

Story has one of my favourite concepts at it's base. That universe is just a someones dream, or, in this case, a simulation made by AI. And now AI is dying. But it's scared, so it just keeps building more and more new simulations. And how number 16 keeps repeating again and again throughout campaign and only in the end of the story you realise, that it's the number of minutes AI is left to live. But this 16 minutes could mean a second, or a year, or a millennium for creatures in the simulation, so instead of living in terror of universe just ending, it's better just to enjoy every moment left. I just find it so cool and beautiful.

And one of my favourite things about the game, something that keeps me returning to it every few month - community expeditions. I love them.

So yeah, this game is ridiculously fun. And they keep adding new stuff! Like, now you can become a robot apparently? It is truly a labour of love.

Recent edit: Should have definitely won the Labor of Love award over CP2077. Proof that the award is a popularity contest, not actual quality contest.

The new base building, freighter ships, and vehicle mechinics really saved this game from being a total failure. Despite a extremely pre-emptive launch of the game by Hello Games, they managed to pull this game around to be a truly enjoyable experience. First, the game was only fun for a few hours, then adventuring from planet to planet for no reason got rather... dull. Now, however-- there's more to it than that.

The game is subliminally separated into three paths-- The Path of the Atlas, The Journey to the Center of the Universe, and The Path of Freedom, is what I call them. The Atlas path cannot be explained without Spoilers, but it's basically the main quest. The Center of the Universe pathline is often the most popular, being rather self-explanitory. The Freedom Path was once the one that was despised... but now that there's things to do, such as claiming a planet as your home, this game improved ten-fold.

Don't let the other reviews fool you-- this game is very fun, you just have to focus on the good bits and forget the poor ones.

EDIT: It's even better every month. I can't believe this game.
--------------------------------------------------------

The game had the worst, shittiest launch for a highly anticipated game that I can think of (yep, including Cyberpunk 2077 in that list). 

However, the game has grown and changed in so many positive ways since then and the developers have poured so much time and effort into building goodwill and regaining their reputation. I couldn't sit by and watch the overall review stay at Mixed. I know this one review will doubtfully alter the overall, but maybe it will change your opinion.

I have spent over 200 hours in the game, with most of that time being after the major updates that have released. Yet, around 26 hours were from the early days--the Dark Ages of NMS, you might say. 

I stuck it out for a couple of reasons:
 [*] I wanted a space sim without supporting Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen.
 [*] I saw the potential in the game beyond the shit storm.
 [*] It also had the bones of a good experience.

My time could've ended there, remembering the game as an over-promised skeleton. Luckily, somehow, the developers have continued pouring resources into the game so that those bones now have muscles, veins, flesh, and even a heart and brain. You're not getting a mindless slog from planet to planet with a dozen variant creatures and plants; you're now getting a space exploration sim with a robust base-building sim within a massive universe full of unique creatures, planets and atmospheres, optionally centered around a Destiny-like hub where you can meet with other players, start planet-spanning missions, and grow your base/arsenal.

The game that was promised now is.",1608928489,1700607992,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I've seen and played many games with a similar history, that the creators have just abandoned. so although initially very disappointed, i am now very grateful this game exists.
I have played many hours on the PS4 version, and have played it on and off since it's first release. 
So recently during the Steam sale i saw it, and thought i'd like to try it on PC to see the difference. and have to say, i am glad i did.

Now exploration: it is very fun just going to a different planet and just stumbling upon something strange or new, both flora and fauna can vary very much from one planet to another and there is even stuff to find in open space, aliens speak to you but unless you explore a lot you'll probably not understand a lot of what they're saying and multiplayer expeditions are usually fun to do.

Well I am here to tell you to forget about all that.  NMS today is an absolutely fantastic game.  The sheer amount of content is staggering.  Want to build really really complex bases?  Check.  Want to build them underwater?  Check.  Want to be the owner of a huge space freighter that you can build a base inside of and go on expeditions with?  Check.  Want to team up with other players and go on missions?  Check.  Want to build several kinds of vehicles, a racetrack and then race them on alien planets?  Check.  Some of the updates are almost like devs realizing their childhood dreams/memories in the game.  It is important that you know that a lot of the game is about grinding materials and/or looking for that one special tool/ship you want by hopping to many many stations.  It will not be for everyone, but it will probably appeal to any MMO player or, dare I say it, anyone that liked Fallout 4 and everyone with a sense of adventure/exploration.  My final thought would be this:  Imagine turning the clock back 5 years, and the game of today released back then.  Here is what I think would have happened.  The whole gaming world would have been stunned.  The game would have gotten 10/10 reviews from every critic in sight and guaranteed ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" from players here on Steam.  It would have won every award there is to win and would have been lauded as one of the greatest gaming achievements ever.  You would want to play a game like that, right?  Well you can.

Since the launch this game has come leaps and bounds adding a immeasurable amount of content and fixes for various bugs.
I very much enjoy this game and have been recently. All my time in NMS has been spent in one single save. I have found the best way to play the game is to set your own goals once you have completed the main story and some key side quests as this allows you to unlock the basic things in the game that make it pretty easy to improve you 'economic position.' Some of my own goals that I have set is getting a fully fleshed out fleet and a pretty nice looking base and freighter if I might add. In addition I have made it my mission to collect some damn nice looking ships and an excessive amount of units (money).

The main pros of the game is the amount of things you can do outside of the main and even side quests, with a little imagination of course. Also there is a fair bit of questing you can do. The game is much more stable then it was back in 2016. The graphics are amazing and well optimised enough where it can run on lower spec machines. The game can also be played in different game modes like a 'normal mode', a 'survival mode' and a 'permadeath mode' as well as a 'creative mode' where you can basically do whatever you want.

The main cons of the game is there are still some lurking bugs, such as randomly falling through the ground, although very rare. Another issue is for me personally random frame drops or lag (this could be an isolated problem). There is (arguably) not enough to do. I say this because I have spent most of my time doing what I want to do and not main quests. The game can feel quite slow and the combat is not anything new or special.

Overall, I would recommend NMS to anyone who has played any sort of RPG/Survival/Sandbox game before like Minecraft, Skyrim or Fallout etc. This game also requires a bit of imagination if you want to do very much past the main quests. To conclude NMS is a very fleshed out game than it once was but still has some lurking issues and isn't for everyone.
Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Note: This game does have a VR mode that I have not yet played on Steam.
Another note: Feel free to ask any questions! : )

First of all this game has a lot of controvercy. While the devs undoubtebly released it too soon, people should stop bitching about it towards the dev team per se, people tend to forget about stuff like investors that want a return & dev teams are often given deadlines.

While the game is maybe not quite up to 60$ standards there's no doubt that it very likely will get there in the near future.

For the people that say it's repetitive (and 99% of the people saying so don't even have 5hrs on the game) I can only say you haven't looked properly because I have now played almost 8 hours and not a single planet that I've visited has been the same & the animal species have been so oddly different that it's hilarious (sausage birds ftw >.< ).
On top of which they've already announced a patch to add more variation in the algoritm for creating worlds.

The second issue people land on is the fact that they can't even play it because it crashes or runs horrible. Watching most of the people say this with less than 20min spent in the game sort of tells me they're not really trying and are just impatient to get on the hatetrain. I have a rig that was top notch 4 years ago and my game runs fine on max settings (except shadows, cause fuck shadows).

TLDR: While the game might not quite be on the list for most people right now I would 100% keep an eye on it because i'm sure it will turn out amazing yet.

Bugs run extremely rampant, from sentinel waves in multiplayer down to main story mission wavepoints just.... not working. The amount of bugs present in current build is too much I didn't know where to start with reporting them. There was a time I had to take a break because of how annoying base building bugs were when parts of my base would just DISAPPEAR.

One other criticism that I have with NMS is that Hello Games has their hands in a lot of cookie jars (those jars being features to the game) with absolutely no depth to any of them. Combat is about as deep as a 1 inch pond, and it gets boring reallllyyyy fast fighting sentinels over....and over....and over. Exocrafts are all pretty much the same except for the Minotaur, as well as the Nautiloid, ALSO both riddled with bugs that make you hesitant to use them. Quests at the space station are sooooo repetitive it makes me not want to pick any of them, and the level difference of the quests mean pretty much nothing.

I think No Man Sky is heading towards a great direction at this pace if HG keeps up with these updates that keep adding content, but please I beg of you, expand on the systems and functions you already have within the game.

Fast forward to now. I bought it about two years ago on sale and it was worth far more than the game at full price. I've sunk so much time into this game, both on Steam and on my Switch. 

What really pulled me back was how much HG expanded the game--and it's become massive. When I first played it, it was at best an inventory management walking sim. Now there's multiple stories, deep lore, fleets, pets, the Nexus, existential questions, capitalism, big ass freighters, frequent events and expeditions, and HG keeps updating and adding more content for free.

Below you will find my original reviews from back when the game first launched. I was quite critical of the game's performance and content vs it's price. I've left it all intact below. 

Hello Games, whether due to a moral compass or as part of it's business strategy, has never let up on NMS. Once they tackled the bulk of the bugs from launch, they have added more and more to the game. Every few months there is a new content update, and never as DLC to buy or add. All the new content is released free already baked into the base game. They've been doing for the last six years and there is no sign that they plan on stopping yet.

So when you look at the Store and see that the game is still regularly priced at $60, on sale at $30, after 6 years, now you know why. It hasn't been like an Origin or EA title with a few updates or tons of paid DLC. 

If you want a space exploration game that can offer hours of enjoyment, NMS has a ton of it. Some of it the NMS community gets controversial about. And there is still an occasional glitch to the game. 

This is one of the few games where I'd say it's worth it even at full price. Having said that, I'm far overdue in flipping this review from negative to positive. I've nominated this in to Steam's game awards for Labor Of Love for a couple of years now. It's about time that my review reflects that.

tl;dr: For $60, It's.... too unstable. Wait for an update.

I don't really want to recommend yes or no, but I have to go with 'no' in hopes of bringing about some improvements sooner than later. I am experiecing just about what everyone else has been talking about: 

* Frame drops
* Hitching
* Soft crashes (can still reboot with reboot switch)
* Hard crashes (can't reboot, must shutdown through power switch)

I did finally get a decent few hours of play time but only after I downgraded the graphics to all low, removed any post-processing, etc. And that still didn't solve any problems other than delaying the inevitable crash. 

The flight controls are funky but you get used to them after a bit. The worlds are pretty cool. I was able to jump around between two planets and a moon with a space station inbetween. The game is actually a lot of fun, but we need some updates to the engine so that it works better on the PC.

It was too frustrating having to repeat lost progress in the beginning. [spoiler]You have to fix your ship before you can really begin exploring the planet. The only way to save the game at this point is to enter the ship, then exit. Upon exiting, a save point is made. Once the ship is repaired and powered up, you can save the game progress at the outposts and whatnot scattered across the planet. So if you find yourself having to walk a long distance for a resource, make sure you can get back to the ship in time before the game crashes. [/spoiler]

I'm sorry, Hello Games. For now, it's not worth $60.

[b][u]OG August 21, 2016 Review Update:[/u][/b]

Update: I've since been on the experimental build and it's very much improved. I've got all the graphics settings maxed out at 1080p except for Anti-Aliasing. That is set to FXAA as Ultra SSAAx4 was causing huge FPS drops, which is understandable. I have even re-enabled the Steam Overlay. So far so good, many more hours of exploring and minimal crashes. 

There are a couple of bugs. Once I found myself falling off of a high platform after launching the game. I had exited the game while standing on it and clipped right through it when going back into it. I also had a moment where the reticle on the ship was off-center. Photo cannon would shoot towards the reticle but the phasers would shoot straight ahead. It wasn't until I warped out to a different system that it reset the alignment to dead ahead. 

The one thing I would really like to see improved upon is the hijacking of the UI during events and achievements. The screen letterboxes and temporarily removes many of the things you can do during the sequence. It really slows the pace of the game down and can cause some issues with hostiles while you're kind of frozen in place waiting for the game to allow you to continue. 

Another UI issue I find aggravating is how equipment slots can extend beyond the viewable screen, for instance when comparing ships or multi-tools. I often can't see the far left or right slots to get an informed decision about the entire object.

Lastly, the click-and-hold stategy to navigating the menus and configuration screens needs to be eliminated. It has a functionality to allow someone to stop just before making a mistake, or changing their mind, but anything in the Escape menus should be simple point and click. Save the click-and-hold to the gameplay.

That's about all I can think of right now. So far I've stumbled upon some ship-to-ship battles, took part in one, stumbled across some more interesting planets, and found a black hole. It's definitely a game with a lot to find. If it could clean up the UI a bit more, I wouldn't mind flipping my thumb from down to up.[/quote]

There's no real shared base building (instead, you can only help build another player's base, but can't [properly] access it while they're offline), and I've experienced (or have friends who experienced) sync issues and other unpleasantries while playing.
I understand if the developers don't want to deal with storing and hosting tons of player saves, but it should at least be possible to implement dedicated servers that you can host yourself, which allow shared base building and a proper, stable multiplayer experience.

All this is quite unfortunate, because the singleplayer sadly quickly became boring for me. The story isn't all too captivating from what I've seen so far, exploring and collecting resources can get ""grindy"" quite fast, and if I've got nobody to share my creations with, I'm not all too motivated to spend lots of time building a sick base (especially since the building, while ok, isn't world-class either).
In the end, because my friends didn't want to put up with the limitations of multiplayer, I ended up not really playing anymore.

A friend of mine started playing the game and told me how its good now and its fun and that I should get it. Curious I checked it out and see how many people love it now and how its really good. And so I had a few dollars to spend on steam, and so I bought the game. And I will never regret that decision!

The game at its core is very simple. Go around planets and find resources, find some things, trade, get new ships and a few other small stuff. Yes you can say that's all the game offers and a few more things you can do, but that's not what its about. Its about exploration, find new planets, find a new planet to call home even! The whole point of the game is to simulate a solo experience on exploring an entire galaxy while doing many other things along the way! The game is a beautiful one with every planet being unique. Now yes the planet types are all going to be similar or the same, and you might see a few of the same plants or animals, but that's alright! It doesn't really bother me at all but I know it does for others.

All the planets you visit are beautiful. Exploring them is always so fun and especially when its night time, just looking at the night sky and seeing the other planets in the distance just calms me and relaxes me and just, its breathtaking, that's all I can say.

To those that still think this game is horrible, a scam, worst game ever. First play it yourself and then you can decide on what the game is, as just saying what it is without ever playing it is just not fair.",1637862956,1700596148,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Wow they still update this game :O

2021 edit:
The development team at Hello Games has demonstrated a commendable commitment to improving their latest title. Through a series of updates and patches, they have addressed many of the issues that were present in the initial release of the game. Furthermore, the addition of new features and continued support from the developer has greatly enhanced the overall gaming experience.

Based on the current state of the game, I am confident in recommending it to others. It is evident that the development team is dedicated to providing players with the best possible experience and that they take player feedback seriously.

Review at release:
As a fan of the gaming industry, I was highly anticipating the release of this particular title. The initial marketing and promotional materials, as well as statements from the developer, suggested that it would be a revolutionary and highly immersive experience.

However, upon playing the game, I was disappointed to find that several key features were absent or underdeveloped. The lack of factions and limitations in the gameplay, such as the inability to land on asteroids and participate in space battles, were major letdowns. Additionally, many elements that were promised in promotional materials, such as the diverse and exotic wildlife, were not present in the final version of the game.

In light of these issues, I would advise caution when considering purchasing this game. While the developer, Hello Games, has made efforts to improve the game and add new features, it still falls short of many of the promises made in the initial marketing campaign. It is worth noting that the game was, in my opinion, overhyped by its developer, Sean Murray, and I would advise to exercise caution when considering purchasing this game.",1472350555,1700591869,True,0,0,0.5,2,True,False,False

NMS has most definitely come a long, long way from what it was in 2016. I had pre-ordered for PS4, played on launch day, played like mad to reach the center of the galaxy and... yeah, what a shame.

It has way more to offer now and feels like a completely different game compared to what it used to be.

QOL tweaks and starting out was incredibly streamlined and simplified. On launch you'd be grinding materials for hours and trying to navigate menus and figure what you were even supposed to be doing in order to just get off the rock you started on (and it was/still is usually a hazardous planet that forced you to rush around and take cover so you don't die to the elements). Currently, you get a bit more hand-holding and direction so you can get started, and once the universe opens up to you and your starship, it's an incredible feeling. 

Exploring each system, scanning the planets, interacting with the aliens, finding new ships, building your own bases, uncovering the story and finding weird things-- it's just so cool once you start to see how ambitious the game is and what it lets you do in the universe. At 200+ hours, I am still finding some new things, and the recent updates have just been adding more. You can play in a variety of ways and take on the story-lines at your leisure, wander around the galaxy, work the trade markets, be a pirate, etc. The game gives you a good amount of options to make money and I think it can appeal to a lot of different play-styles. 

The game isn't perfect, however. I'm still seeing bugs and issues I would assume should have been fixed since launch. I sometimes still clip through planets and space stations, suspended in limbo until I reload a save. Planets, while there are a few dozen different types to discover, become a 'once you see one, you've seen them all' type of experience. For example, every type of cold, hot, toxic, etc. type of planet will literally have the same style of plants, animals, and overall look and feel to them, with the only variety being how bumpy they are, or having one or two unique features like resource nodes and rock formations. The planet climate and features are also the same no matter where you are on it (i.e., North/South poles, equator aren't any different/ landscapes do not change dramatically). 

I know it's a procedural game, and I can't speak to how difficult implementing climate zones or terrain changes would be, but you don't have much reason to explore a planet for more than a few minutes unless you are looking for materials/wildlife, building a base, or working on missions. I find it really strange that a game focused on nearly infinite exploration would have that aspect be its absolute weakest point. I will say that for me, it took quite a while of playtime to start feeling this way, but I have still been having a great time playing the game to see what else the game can generate in terms of starship, creature, and planet variety. The recent additions like the Multiplayer hub, exocraft, customization, random interactions, and freighters has really made certain aspects of the game fun and fresh again. 

I could go on and on, but my thoughts in summation? Watch some streamers play to see if it's your type of thing, take a look at the Internet Historian video, get the game on sale, and understand the game is still a quirky indie game and very much an open sandbox to play in-- but still improving and getting better and better with each update.

Ultimately what killed NMS for me was the samey-ness; all the planets, animals, plants, ships, started to look the same.  I had seen it all and the wonders of the 'infinite universe' wore off.  I was happy with my 60 or so hours in the game and felt I'd gotten my moneys worth.

But now Hello Games have just dropped what essentially feels like NMS 2 as a free update.  Take if from someone who played the game to death at launch - this update is fantastic.  Explorations is back and planets feel fresh again; there is now massive vistas, mountains that touch the clouds and caverns that run for miles and hide secrets.  But on top of that the core game has had a complete overhaul, there is literally hundreds of things to do - beside the main story missions - and the new crafting, base building and character creation is a great addition.

So i was really jonesing for a space game about oh... 30-40 hrs of gameplay ago. So i booted up elite dangerous, but things took too long and it didn't run the best on my steam deck. Then i remembered i have no man's sky.

I hadn't played since the NEXT update i believe. So i see it's verified on the deck and install it.

Performance is not great, lots of stuttering and dipping down into the mid 20s if you travel to far too quickly on planets. Otherwise a pretty respectable 40. (some of the performance issues are my fault, it defaults to standard but i wanted a few things to be higher quality so i bumped textures and planet quality up.)

Tutorial still sucks and i wish it would go die in a fire. I don't know how many players that tutorial has cost em but i bet it's up there.

BUT once you get going it becomes a pretty relaxing and...enjoyable? experience.

I wouldn't say i'm ever having a blast but i'm not not having fun, if that makes sense.

It's a bit too grindy and after awhile the planets and creatures on them start to feel samey. Awhile in this case being 10ish hrs.

Oh also, this game is an assault on your ear drums. UNITS RECIEVED UNITS RECIEVED. I GET IT THEY""RE RECIEVED!

That and the game never freaking relaxes on the mission front. Sometimes i just want to fly around and do my own thing but that pesky pop up keeps rearing its ugly head and i feel like i HAVE to go do it.

Also, most of the mechanics are still pretty shallow. If you've done something once you've basically seen all there is to see.


So i get that that seems like a LOT of gripes but, it's seven years later and few games manage to do what this one does. Sure there's a few like elite or starfield i guess (I wouldn't know, i'm on a bethesda boycott.) but that's really it as far as space sims go. 

There's nothing quite like flying into space, traveling the unknown galaxy, finding a planet you like and completely destroying it in the name of progress.

I guess if i had to sum it up.

No man's sky is a game. Play it before bed or after work to while away a few hrs and relax. If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere.

Planets still look and feel the same as they did in v1, combat feels the same, enemies feel the same, ships feel the same, AI of everything is still a joke, PG animals still look goofy AF. Still no giant animals like in that famous trailer. Space combat feels the same. Exploration feels the same.

Really wish they'd implemented any type of combat or something else than ""mining"" the now slightly different combat drones. and i'm not talking about turning the mining gun into every other gun (If you've ever played you know all these are useless except for the grenade launcher and regular rifle), i'm talking any semblance of a fight in this game devolves into: run for cover or create cover which will fuck up the AI and give you the ""i'm stupid, please kill me"" advantage, hide and shoot from cover, kill everything without getting a single scratch, repeat. Never heal, reload is always the same, why would you ever dogde or run if you can just create a whole fucking sniper's dream nest

It will get boring, really, really fast if you are on your own, as it's stands there's no PVP or PVE that's worth anyone's time, progression is mining the same shit forever just as it was in v1, same as money making. Getting a good ship is just 20 minutes away from grinding the same planets over and over again and selling it for 60 Mill. What you think GOLD will make you money? go dig up some bone, now that's the stuff that they want. That's the stuff that they've always wanted, since it's implementation.

There's no sense of danger even in hardcore, iron man runs, nothing to be obtained from the ""lore"" or quests. No presence will ever scare you or excite you, NPCs are as brainless as everything else, including story NPCs.

Planets feel bland, not empty, they are full of generic stuff for sure, but it's all so bland and ""SAFE"" that you can leave your character just standing there to go take a shit and come back and nothing will EVER happen to you. Every creature is your friend and is there mindlessly doing their biz. I've seen enemy creatures, but it's also the same type of creature in every planet, and only activates if you rob their eggs or mine around their territory, again sniper nest + grenade launcher, create your little floating island and kill every thing.

The only excitement i've ever gotten was seeing a giant worm leap in front of me. All the more disappointing when you find out, it can't actually crush you or your buildings.

One of the most striking aspects of No Man's Sky lies in the sheer immensity of its world. Spanning billions upon billions of procedurally generated planets, this game offers an almost limitless playground for exploration and discovery. What once seemed like an insurmountable task of endless repetition in the past has now transformed into a mesmerizing journey of unforeseen surprises.

The beauty of No Man's Sky lies in its ability to instill a sense of awe as you venture forth into the unknown. Time and time again, I found myself stumbling upon planets that defied my expectations, with stunning landscapes, unique creatures, and uncharted resources waiting to be claimed. The sheer joy of uncovering something that deviates from the world's original blueprint is truly an experience like no other.

The ability to build and customize your own base is where No Man's Sky truly shines. The freedom to establish your abode on a planet of your choosing, meticulously selecting the perfect site to suityour needs and aesthetic preferences, is a gratifying process. From carefully constructing each component to designing the layout, the base-building aspect of the game is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of intergalactic travel. It adds a personal touch to your journey and truly makes you feel invested in the world you inhabit.

While the game's missions may not be its strongest suit, they still provide ample opportunities for engaging gameplay and progression. Whether you're embarking on a perilous quest to rescue a stranded creature or simply exploring ancient ruins for valuable artifacts, the missions offer a sense of direction amidst the vastness of the universe. And although they may not be the main focus, they contribute significantly to the game's overall sense of replayability.

In conclusion, No Man's Sky with the Echo Update showcases the immense world it promised to deliver, and then some. The size and scope of the game are truly awe-inspiring, providing endless opportunities for discovery and adventure.",1696632825,1700422516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR:
[/h2]

[b]
In everything No Man's Sky is a very nice game. For me a bit to grind intensive especially with the new expeditions which are time limited. But it is remarkable how intensively and long the developers have dealt with this game and still do. I recommend playing it with friends, because then it is even more fun.

Review:
[/h2]

The beginning of the game is a lot of fun. You find yourself in a strange world and have to find out why, for what reason and where you are. But after you have gone into space and visited some systems, you lose the thread. The main story gets lost in unimportant side quests, and even if you try to follow it you won't find any real sense in the main story. Here I think the story should be further developed and emphasized more. I think it's good that you don't have to follow the main story, but if you have a main story, it could be filled with more action, because the game itself already has all the features for that. (Or I'm not deep enough in the main story yet, because I don't really find it)

Another point that I often find disturbing is the grind. Usually the gameplay consists of: Fly to this planet. Mine this stuff. Inventory full. Thrusters empty. Mine the cloth to charge the engines. Fly to another planet... The grinding itself wouldn't really bother me, if you could search for minerals from the spaceship while hovering over the planet, or with the scanner of the multitool. Something like it is used in the game ""Subnautica"" would be interesting, where you can scan for only one specific substance.

A last point would be that I would not recommend changing the application while playing the game, because the game will crash. That's why I think it would be nice if Hello Games would intrduce autosave for every like 5min so that you can walk around without a Beacon on hand or spaceship nearby without fearing to lose the progress made in the last 20 min.

Some people will get bored after visiting their second system while some people will find themselves constantly coming back for more because there isn't anything quite like it. A space-sim this is not, and maybe it'd be better to call it a charming and cozy sci-fi sandbox.

Great game for just relaxing, listening to podcasts/music, and exploring a virtually unlimited number of new worlds to find the perfect one for a base. There's a satisfaction that comes from getting better upgrades and slowly unlocking more and more blueprints as the list of discovered star systems, planets, flora, fauna, and minerals grows ever larger. While this is a relatively easy game overall--after the first couple hours you'll rarely want for much in the way of survival so much as space to store everything--I would argue that the charm lies in just how freeform the experience is. Whether it's building a seabase and exploring the vast oceans on one planet or adopting a giant mushroom creature as a makeshift pet/vehicle on another, there's always more to see and find. When it all feels like it has become too familiar, just abandon everything and hop into a black hole to get a fresh start somewhere else in the universe. Or hell, just make a new character. The early to mid game power growth actually makes starting new characters fun and the difficulty options can be individually tweaked to your liking making each playthrough feel potentially different.

Basically, this is a great game for those who are craving an experience which prioritizes the joy of exploration. It's always getting better (and definitely still has room to grow) and really just does a great job at making the player feel like an explorer venturing onto uncharted planets and surveying them properly for the first time. There may be the occasional generated outpost here and there, but it truly does feel like (and chances are very strong) the player is the very first to see the places they come across. The only other comparison I can make with this game would be like if a company looked at the idea of the uncharted worlds from Mass Effect 1 and thought to greatly expand upon it and make an entire game out of it. While there are often similarities in the vastness of what can be discovered, the sheer joy of exploration itself is what the point is and that means that No Man's Sky scratches a certain itch that few other games do and it does it pretty well.",1700308565,1700308565,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:

2. Great lore and history! (may require reading lol)
3. Fun with friends and family... Truly it is (crossplay support)!
4. Immersive as all get out. Roleplay to your hearts content! (STAY AWAY FROM THE ANOMALY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME!!!)
5. Is always updated with what could be considered ""DLC"" content! (for free)
and much more!

Cons:

1. Repetitive ""enemies"" and worlds. (Proceedurally Generated)
2. No active enemies/combat like fallout or COD games.
3. Can get boring quick if you WIKI or Cheat your way through the game. Or use coordinate exchange (Don't be a wuss find your own Sh!t folks lol)

i love how nms's universe has enough sci fi tropes and realism to be familiar and make just as much sense to new players as lore-experts while also not letting real life technicalities such as life not being on every planet or celestial bodies being very far apart stop it from being unique.

the story is amazing and I was very intrigued by it's themes of surreality and self-questioning. but i was surprised by how right as these themes started to fully set in for me and the direction in which i thought the story was going to go became clear, it took a fast turn in order to abruptly end.

the use of strange visions and hallucinations wouldve been by far my favorite part of the story and exploration gameplay if they actually happened instead if being described like im reading a book or some nerd stuff like that. of course this isnt because of laziness, but because hello games is an indie developer and just couldnt afford to make a cinematic animated cutscene for each of them. making this yet another example of how this game sometimes feels like a proof of concept.

ironically, despite how surreal the game is, the space combat is exactly what i would imagine a space dogfight would be in real life. and while the game isnt as combat based as i thought it was going to be (and this is for the better) the occasional space battles were really fun and its a shame i dont see them mentioned in other reviews because of the focus of the gameplay being exploration.

even though collecting items from randomly generated structures by going to a waypoint on your UI seems terrible on paper, the aforementioned story and worldbuilding as well as how good the game's environments look encoraged me to do things like scan the same model of a rock 7 times on different planets, or learn languages i dont actually need to know because for some reason the game explains what the aliens are talking about after you read all their gibberish. so even though im against games whose main selling point is that theyre fun to look at, im all for games that can convince me that im living someone else's life (figuratively of course).

the only reason im not om my way to log another 100 hours on this game is because all of the gameplay aspects in some way revolve around resource gathering, which is by far the least fun thing you do in this game. in other procedurally generated open world games like minecraft or terraria resource gathering is made fun by consistently putting obstacles in the player's way, so that each time you go to mine iron it's a little adventure. in no mans sky, even with all of the difficulty settings cranked all the way up any obstacles can be easily exploited, have to be dealt with by waiting them out, or just arent there.

at first i thought the sentinels played this role because they attack you if you mine and you had to kill them to gather resources, but instead if you try to fight the sentinels they will endlessly come at you until you die or learn that you will always have to resort to hiding instead of having engaging gameplay. because of all that after 91 hours playing the game becomes a chore because you have to go through all that not-having-fun bull crap before you can have fun for a little bit.

i was willing to put up with this for 91 hours though because not too much grinding was necessary to have fun until now, and i dont feel like getting the best equipment will be worth it because whether your ship is the old and busted radiant pillar or the exotic new hotness they all operate the same.

nms still has some of the aura of overambition and missed potential around it since 2016 preventing it from being the true masterpiece it is supposed to be. as dunkey, the guy who ive based my entire personality on said ""those first 2 hours were just amazing"", nowdays that threshold has increased to exactly 91.4 hours. which is probably alot more than the average person plays an individual game.

Now with all the updates, there's so much more to do and it's much more multiplayer friendly, without forcing it onto you as well.

Pros:
- Optional multiplayer, including missions you can pick up.
- Lot's of beautiful scenery.
- Easy to get the hang of.
- Can focus on base building and/or exploring.
- Creature taming. Haven't tried it yet, but it's a thing.
- (Nearly) complete terrain destructibility. Sadly you can't drill down to the planet's core, but you can destroy quite a bit of terrain. Maybe one day they'll allow you to destroy planets, but I guess that would be putting too much power into player's hands.
- Upgrading equipment. You can upgrade your tool or ship from rank C all the way to S if you're patient enough to farm what's needed. (Don't know about freighters yet)
- Steam Deck compatible.
- No micro transactions.
- Seriously, no micro transactions.

Cons:
- Repetitive fauna. While you will definitely encounter a large variety of creatures, once you travel to multiple planets, things begin to get very repetitive. It does make finding truly unique creatures more satisfying though.
- The grind. It's not that bad for minerals and the likes, but for quicksilver, you (as far as I'm aware) can only do 2 missions to earn it a day. The average reward I've seen is 400 and with so many items at 3000, it's a tad annoying.
- You cannot customise your ship's appearance.
- What is inventory space? If you want to get into the construction part of the game, be prepared to have no inventory space.
- Scan away from target. I encounter a lot of issues where there are multiple mission based scan targets and it will prioritise further ones to lead you to sometimes. I've been sent 20 minutes out from my ship once only to return to it on foot and find one not even a minute away from my ship because the scanner didn't tell me about that one.
- No cross platform play with Switch. I've seen many articles stating it has cross platform play with all consoles including switch, so I got it for my friend only to find out that the ""cross platform"" with switch is limited to base sharing. It was very disappointingly misleading articles and I should have done closer research, but of course google brings all the misinformation to the top. (This con only matters if you plan on getting it for a friend on switch or getting it to play with someone on switch)
- Let me destroy worlds!

Despite its cons, I still do greatly enjoy playing the game. It's a great pass time and I'm sure it'll be even more fun to play once I can get to play with my friend. It is very repetitive, but it still has its charm that I keep coming back to. Plus I hope to one day find that perfect alien life form to adopt as a pet. I wonder if I can create an invasive species problem on another planet.",1699983612,1699983612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Excellent story-telling and background lore.
Excellent crafting and itemisation.
Good ground combat.
Good exploration (as good as is possible for endless procedural generated content)
A Multitude of engage-able side-hustles which remain relevant to game-play until (I assume) the very late game.

I can on one saved game just crash out immediately every time, or be at the end of a mission (that you cannot save) and get to the anomaly then CRASH!, of course with no save point that is 1 and a half hours just wasted for nothing. 2 bug reports sent to support but nothing over about a week and a half. Honestly, I've had enough but I guess I had my money's worth out of it. I may return to it some time but for me the game has become far too annoying. I understand it is a little unfair to give it a thumbs down, I would rather give it a MEH! or neutral vote at this time in the game's life but as I imagine this issue is down to the new 'upgrades' that thumb is pointed in that direction. If you don't have issues it can be an amazing and engrossing game, if you do get problems then have something soft and indestructible to release your frustration on rather than headbutting your expensive keyboard in despair.
UPDATE: 
I came back to the game some time ago and have to say the crashes (touch wood) seem to be a thing of the past. Loading times have become rather painful though, but I can live with that.

However, the journey of No Man's Sky since then is nothing short of remarkable. The developers at Hello Games committed themselves to continuous improvement, releasing a series of major updates that have transformed the game into a vastly more fulfilling experience.

The addition of features like multiplayer, base building, and a deeper exploration system has breathed new life into No Man's Sky. The once barren and repetitive planets now boast diverse biomes, flora, and fauna, enhancing the sense of exploration. The revamped graphics and improved user interface contribute to a more polished and visually appealing game.

Frequent updates, such as the Beyond and Origins expansions, have not only addressed the initial shortcomings but have also introduced a plethora of new content and quality-of-life improvements. The community engagement and developer transparency throughout this process have fostered a renewed sense of trust among players.

In its current state, No Man's Sky stands as a testament to the potential for redemption in the gaming industry.

* Devs don't care. Most of the bugs from early 2022 are sill there. Some stuff got worse.
* Terrible console UI.
* ""Variety"" is a fake. Procedural planet generation does not matter because in the end, it's just the hazard type and flora/fauna visuals. Archeological digs are always the same dig. Crashed freighters are always the same freighter. Planetary POIs are always the same POIs. Pirate fights are always the same routine of ""hold autolock and fire"". There is a variety of things you can ""do"", but the ""things"" themselves are always the same and it gets boring fast. The game is shallow.
* Absolutely abominable galaxy map. ZERO redeeming qualities. Pure garbage. Impossible to tell star colour by looking at the f*****g star colour because the purely decorative ""space clouds"" change the hue of whatever is in them. And the star colour is actually important in this game. 10/10. Then again, why should it be good? The planets are not meant to be returned to 95% of the time, it’s a “visit and forget” game.
* Achievement vignette screens which wrestle control from you and get you killed. It's been like this since forever, apparently.
* Multiplayer is a lie. You can play ""alongside"" your friends, but you can not play ""with"" them. Aside from the random Nexus missions (which are there to let people grind and pass time), quests are not shared, so you cannot progress the story together. You cannot even fight the same enemies most of the time, because only the player who spawned them can see them. Brilliant. Want to take your friend somewhere in your freighter? You cannot. Want to give them your extra ship or weapon as a present? You cannot. Want to visit their settlement which is in a system you haven't been to? You have to trick the game into letting you do this. So technically, you cannot.

TL/DR: This is a CASUAL game which got big, from a small dev team. For all its advertised variety, it's very shallow, restricted, and feels fake. Probably good to play for an hour after work while having a couple of beers, but not much else.

2022: Feels like Spore Galactic Adventures but without the creative element. The interface and crafting system is in dire need of quality of life improvements - playing this for an extended period of time turns into an test of patience. The game makes way too many decisions instead of the player: which inventory window to open, which quest to mark as current, what the base walls should look like, the list goes on - and there is no way of changing this behaviour. Almost feels like No Man's Sky is actively resisting player control, which in my opinion is rather ridiculous in a sandbox game.",1646440292,1699805944,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

UPDATE: I now have over 700 hours on this game. It has remained one of the best games of this type. Updates are free and I think the devs need some respect for this. In an industry that is constantly trying to gouge players for every penny, NMS has been true to their word about putting out quality updates for free.

First I'll say, no other game has ever felt like what no mans sky has brought to the table. It's beautiful, vivid, and alive. It's done after all these years what starfield only wishes it could do.
And the devs care so much about this game, every update brings something new, something good, new content that is story line or a new line of ships or freighter. I've been playing since day one (bought on ps4) and have since bought it for xbox and steam. I know it's procedurally generated the thousands and thousands of systems that it has but honestly it doesn't even feel like it.
Every planet is different in some way. Yo uwill never experience the same flora or fauna, the same atmosphere mixed with any of these things.
No mans sky is a top tier game that is absolutely worth 60 bucks even after 7 years running.
I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into space and Sci fi games.

If you LOVE crafting, you are going to *like* this game. 80% of the game is resources gathering, 18% is crafting.

Long story:

I played a lot of space games from Tie Fighters to Star Citizen, X3, Elite, just name it… But this one is really bad and is not about space at all.

Distances are very short: planets are tiny, and everything is packed together so you don’t have to wait more than 10 seconds of micro jump to reach your destination on another planet or on the same planet (unless you are on foot).

All planets are habitable, and they look all identical. Oh, yes, that’s true, one is red, the other is blue, one is hot, another is radioactive. Some NPC are round while others are square. Exploration is pointless: If everything looks the same, what is the point? I’d rather visit three planets in unfinished and unstable Star Citizen, than just harvesting forever resources in the million random planets of No Man Sky.

At least, in Star Citizen, there is an atmosphere and personality. Here everything looks cartoonish, the audio is boring, and I don’t feel I am exploring space like I could in Elite or X3.

Wait! There are missions, isn’t it? Oh, yes, if you want to do the 5 exact same mission: kill 10 innocent creatures, deliver a box in a randomly generated place, upgrade your suit by doing exactly the same things over and over. No thank you! Especially with the travel time of maybe 1-minute tops between specific location, it is like solving pointless mission by pressing fast travel button.

What about space combat? Should be cool with custom starships isn’t it? Oh, my: I don’t know how this is supposed to work, but either you try to do it manually, and fight against the controls, either you press an automatic button (I am not joking), and your ship aims automatically to the closest target, so you just have to press fire. Oh! Just got an achievement for killing 10 ships by pressing the auto kill button! I really feel like an ace now!

80% of the time you are harvesting planets, plans and animals by shooting at them. Mining in Eve Online is certainly much more meaningful and rewarding…

Oh, I forgot: What about playing with friends? I believe I haven’t seen in such a long time a game which so many network bugs. Incredible things, not just de-synch objects and quests, but also, my world was shifted by 10 meters compared to what my friend was living… So, as soon as we were in buildings, we could not interact and cooperate to do things properly. I was on one side of a wall, while my friend was on the other side… Good programming for a 7-year-old game!

I tried long enough. After 20 hours or so, I still didn’t see any interesting storyline. NPC are without personality. What is the point of learning a language when you don’t care about what NPCs are saying? At some point I learned enough to know that there are very few dialogs, and everyone is just saying the same boring things, like lobotomized cartoon characters.

I think you got the idea. I tried to have fun with my friend in a well-established universe and game. I wasted my time and money on that one…",1699648666,1699648666,False,3,0,0.462976723909378052,0,True,False,False

Game didn't start with my screen resolution and you can't access options from the start menu, and the game froze during world gen...

On my 2nd attempt my game finally loaded and could finally access graphical options to change the game's resolution to a proper one! Why the game doesn't let you do this without starting or loading a save is beyond me.

My spawn was a heavily radioactive planet, but I have managed to find a cave system filled hostile fauna that had sodium and oxygen! This part was actually really fun once I've dealt with the frustration of getting thrown onto a planet with my hazard protection almost instantly reaching 0.

I left the planet thinking the next location I'll need to go to will be a more manageable world, like last time I've played this game. 

No! It's on the same planet I just left! And now there is something new that wasn't last time I've played it! Pirates! And they are camping the location I'm supposed to go to!

Tried few times to fly further away and wait hoping they will go somewhere else, but no! They are still there!

How am I supposed to fight 2 pirates right after I was just told the basics of flying and didn't had any time to get used to it? And I've already have spent too much time at the beginning to just go thought it all again not knowing if the same might happen when I'll leave the planet.

Actual 'playing' is broken up by long travel times, unnecessarily slow text display in dialogs, an awful ""Let us do the thinking for you"" build system, and an economy that is super-easy to game.  In an hour of time I might actually play for 20 minutes.  Add to it a UI that drifts as soon as you move the mouse as if to avoid your clicks, and it's enough to break a seasoned game player.  I can understand why people like it, and if it's on a deep sale I might suggest it, but overall I find it increasingly shallow, tedious, and frustrating to 'play'.

I keep on stumbeling over weirder and weirder limitations in what you can build.
A few examples being: You are limited to placing 16000 structures in one single save (in a game with a universe thats so big that you VERY rarely meet other players, or even see structures from other players (unless you are in a galaxy center or are in the Anomaly)
Placing more than 9 landingpads for starships apparently is a big nono
And the very latest i stumbled across, you cant place more than 50stickers of a certain kind (in this case the ""white line"" sticker) in one base is prohibited, making it more or less impossible to build a detailed large base, even IF you have saved all buildable structures (16000) for that single base build.

While the amount of content on offer is great and there is a compelling game loop of exploration, the game is an aggressively disjointed game with an indie dev feel with many bugs and half-baked features. It would be one thing if the game was in Early Access but it was released in 2016. 

The space travel system, with no obvious loading screens, delivers on what most other space/scify games have been missing. That said, the amount of pop-in/graphical glitches and hitches keeps me at arms length in terms of immersion. 

Unlike Bethesda's empty worlds, there are generally a lot of points/objects of interest that keep me wanting to explore over the next hill. These points and objects lose their value to the player over time.

The language system is novel and appreciated but often feels a bit under utilized and disregarded when inconvenient.

One third of the game is spent in the inventory system shuffling around resources, recharging meters and flipping between other inventory screens. (Thankfully storage of resources becomes a non-issue rather early on) It feels as if most of this grind was added to make all the resources be more useful. 

The combat system is a cruel joke in almost every regard. The main antagonists being able to heal/repair throughout combat being insult to injury. The space combat is as simple as ""hold down the fire button until the ship goes boom."" However enemy freighter battles can be more interesting... if rare.   

Ship customization is basically nonexistent and requires the player to roll the RNG dice at shipping docks in hopes of finding their ""perfect"" ship. This feels like a major missed opportunity.

I almost forgot that I disabled both the sound and the music when I could no longer stand the screeching creatures and constant ships buzzing my character on the planets. 

There is too much content and various other systems in the game to cover in this written format but they all suffer in the same regards, they are half-baked, contain bugs and, generally, are not well implemented.

In conclusion, No Man's Sky might be worth a try when on sale and if you understand that there are serious issues with the game. There can be a compelling loop if you can overlook the numerous issues.",1699475695,1699475695,False,6,0,0.487914502620697021,0,True,False,False

That video needs seen, a lot of untrue information floats around.
As for the game and why you should play this particular game,

1. It is one purchase, no dlc, and consistant beyond the point of where it could stop content. Other games will nickle and dime you for what is free from dlc and heaping your cart just so you can go to a space lounge

2. Sure modular ship building is currently in another game, but tbh I build bricks, and settling on premade designs by the game maker feels greatly underwhelming to the truely random chance a ship will ever be the same you buy in no mans sky

3. Every game I play, whether Outer Worlds, or Elite Dangerous, or even skyrim in space have the underwhelming issue of too little planets, and if there were a lot, once you see a rock, you have seen almost the entire galactic standard of stones. See a giant toad, don't worry convergant evolution took care of it, you now have seen every toad. NMS every new world I land, it rarely comes up I see rocks in the same solar system to another, the animals are diverse even of their own species on the same world.

4. The devs have not slowed down and do not show sign of stopping. When we see skyrim in space 5th edition super special package, it is entirely possible these hard workers will still find a way to be inpressive.

I was a huge critique, but since seeing the game even about 5ish years ago, it has come so far. I hope I made a compelling arguement, if an unabridged list.",1699343813,1699343813,True,1,1,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Planets have way too much life.

Ships glitch awkwardly around other large ships and space stations

I did not get it then and I did watch the absolute drama that followed its release. I did actually like what I saw even with the failed ideas and everything else and then I saw them start to improve it. I picked it up on sale some time later and played until I hit a game breaking bug. This became a pattern for me as the game kept drawing me back in but then also kept breaking, but with each new iteration it was more stable, and less broken. Eventually, I stopped breaking the game.

There is something really magical about this game. It's still flawed and frankly it tries to do so many things now that no one system has all that much depth. The sheer number of ways you can interact with the game though are boggling now. There is a story which is frankly an existential crisis in the making. There are side stories which are basically tutorials for various systems. The main thing though is that is a giant sandbox. A whole universe for you to explore. You will see planets that no other person has ever set foot on or looked at and some of them are weird and janky but lots of them are amazing. You want it to be a space fighter? Hatch and raise your own living ship? You can do that. You want to build elaborate bases? You can do that. Establish a manufacturing empire? Become a trader? Become a smuggler? Tamper with the genetic makeup of creatures? Engage in epic firefights? Run your own village? Build a farm? Become a chef? Team up with other players to achieve your goals? Wander the universe entirely alone? Explore underwater depths filled with eldritch horrors in your submarine? Explore abandoned ships lost in space? Build racing courses to power around in your exocraft? All of this you can do and more.

And what do I do? I mostly just wander around scanning stuff, looking at all the weird and cool things. I'm still finding new things.

The relatively recent addition of entirely customisable difficulty across multiple different factors means you can pretty much tailor your experience to whatever is fun for you. Gathering materials isn't fun? No problem you can turn that off. Combat isn't your thing? Banish it. Don't want to have to fuss with making money? Sure, everything is free. OR alternatively if you want to ramp up the difficulty or the costs or the danger - you can do that too.

But ..

It's still a paper thin game. 
All planets are basically the same thing. The visuals are a bit different and fun for a few hours but then you kinda see past the varnish and realize they are all built from the same blueprint with very small cosmetic differences. And this matters in the long run. I don't have a problem with the lack of different biomes on single planets as this is probably programatically problematic AND prevents exploration. But the planets themselves are so boringly similar - except for some textures and color maps. Same ruins. Same platforms. Same ships flying. Same basic everything. Same same same. 
Speaking of which. All space stations ARE the same (except pirate stations that looks a bit different). And they are everywhere. With the same NPCs and same basic comodities. Same. 
Great for practicing language skills, mindnumbingly boring if you want to explore and discover NEW things. At least make the stations differnt per race or economic level or .. 

I mean .. It can be done. Elite Dangerous is gorgeous with a lot more diversity in the universe than NMS will ever have. (It's got other issues, though). 

I am sorry, I really want to like this. And I do. In small portions. Mainly the Expeditions (they should make them permanent and discoverable in-game).

But it's a shallow and hollow basebuilding game (not very good at that either, but people are amazingly creative) with a lack of depth and focus on what it should be and want to be. 
Exploration? Tech demo? Basebuilder? 
Now it's kind of bad at everything unless you glance at it quickly.

EDIT: My sentiment above stands, two years later. They add bits and pieces here and there to make it SEEM a complete ""experience"". Whenever I get back in I look for the changes that would make this truly enjoyable - and they never show up, unfortunately. 
It is a Dyson sphere of a game - on paper and scope huge, but in reality without depth and enough diversity in the long run to stay.. 
Some things are better of course.. Lots of textures and (nowadays) robots and actual wildlife on some planets. But it is still paper thin and gets old quickly. There is no point in exploring or trying to discovery anything. The lack of space stations in some systems in the early days was actually something I miss. TO boldly go required emergency drives or planning...
I search aimlessly for interesting things but, much like the persona you have in-game, you find yourself in an endless loop of disappointment and lackluster efforts - but every ""expansion"" adds a few shiny things to distract you for a short while..

I must say Hello Games has definitely pulled NMS out of the gutter since the days of old. But the game is still just not for me. There are a few reasons.

A: The starship... everything. Since day one, in 2016 I have HATED the starship mechanics. Loathed them even. I have prayed to the Devs for them to announce in every update that they have overhauled the flight controls. NMS literally has the least realistic flight control mechanics out of all the space games I own.

B: I am rapidly transiting over to mostly VR gaming. I figured after nearing a year of VR I would give NMS another shot. I was disappointed to say the least. NMS is NOT optimized for VR. I have a decent graphics card that has been great with all my other titles. But not NMS. I noticed warbling in the background and refresh delays in my peripheral vision AT ALL TIMES. Not cool. And here I feel the need to once again talk about flight mechanics. Am I meant to be driving a bloody forklift!? The controls are literally that of a forklift. It felt just as clumsy as one. The instant motion sickness isn't necessarily the games fault, but I feel like realistic ship controls would have really helped.

C: This is probably the least important point I'll make here... but anyone who was psyched into preordering the game may understand. The planets, environments, and especially the fauna are BORING! In my opinion they have still failed to capture the wonder, diversity, liveliness, and beauty of the ecosystems shown in Sean Murray's original trailer. 

TL:DR
Im a bitter preorder survivor that has clung to the game in the hopes they'd make everything about the starship more realistic and less airplane with ball and chain. Now in VR its not optimized and a poor port.",1699174335,1699174335,False,0,0,0.427777767181396484,0,True,False,False

Field of View settings changes do basically nothing. I become physically ill playing this game. Load time: About 5 minutes.

Update 2022: The game has definitely improved, but the in-game Field of View settings are still not coded correctly. The max is listed as 100 degrees, but most definitely is not and in no way reflects that visually. Adjusting the config above the in-game max of 100 seems to have some effect, but less than expected. At least at 120 the game can be played at an acceptable FOV.

Surprisingly getting 80-100+ FPS with a 1060 but all other specs are current high-end including SSD.

2023: The game sucked me back in. Devs: please for the love of all that is good still work on those Field of View settings and code it correctly. Stop zooming me in so close to the character. It's really aggravating. 

More worth the price than it has ever been. The updated with the autophage content is really good.

I heard the stories of how it was slowly redeeming itself as the years passed, but trying the game in late 2023 was worth the experience.

No Man's Sky is the ultimate casual experience for people who want a relaxing and expansive Science Fiction game. The game feels infinite, and worth exploring. The game focuses strongly on the experience of exploration, and being a traveler in an in-game universe that truly feels infinite.

The procedural generation running the game makes the game have a shockingly small installation size considering the scope of the game, and it makes a lot of the game follow predictable patterns. However, what I have found amusing, is when the game bugs out and planets that are procedurally generated becomes uniquely shaped by the bugs. Inverse mountains? Check. Discovering funny named planets? Check. Planets colliding with other planets, having two different forms of gravity? Check and check.

No Man's Sky is probably my best gameplay experience of 2023. After 300 hours of playing it intensely, I need a break... but I know I will come back for future patches, expeditions and the like. I did not finish everything there was to do, but I am happy, because that gives me worthwhile goals upon my inevitable return.

- Beautiful and eye catching game, colourful, scenic, the space is amazing.
- Space travel is so cool, the ""open worldness"" of the game is hugely vast and spectacular.
- Great game-play and concept, can't get bored easily.

Cons
- The walking is bugged a little bit especially walking up through the mountains sideways. REALLY need to fix the movement in this game, feels like a game that just started its early access.
- I expected better graphics but not a big deal.
- Optimization is crap. Could hardly get 60FPS Ultra on my 1060 6GB.

Conclusion
Overall, worth buying. It's a great game to spend some time on and explore the vast cosmos. Needs some improvements and hopefully we will get that.

There's just so much to do that feels original and exciting. Thankfully, pretty quickly, travel and tedious mechanics become easier with gear and base upgrades.

SPOILER I just started overseeing a settlement and fought of some pirate attackers in a space dogfight for a massive reward. I only hope this kind of surprises continue for a long time.

Got the graphics settings to Enhanced and running pretty smooth - 85% of the time frame rate is acceptable. Even in the Anomaly and doing missions online with many players doesn't seem to hurt things too bad, but it does slow down considerably at times in these conditions.

After reading a decent amount of reviews on Starfield which always seemed to reference back to NMS, and talking to most of my gamer friends, the consensus was to just buy No Man's Sky (Sorry Bethesda!! I still love you..). Now I got the game after the update (which I guess made it awesome) so I would say this - NMS imo is definitely the game to buy FIRST.  Its BA. Its like if Destiny, Borderlands, and Minecraft all banged and then the doctor asked ChatGPT for the name of this beautiful baby. Its not ultra hyper-realistic (which is what I imagine Starfield to be like) so its got a little more give in its universe to allow for some liberties to be taken and its content to be maybe not so dry ?? NMS offers a huge helping of both fantasy and realism, a proper scale in customizations and the ability to upgrade virtually your entire environment while still leaving certain aspects of the game to chance (multi-tool, sharship, freighter, etc). Here was was my gameplan and so far, so GREAT! Im going to let Starfield work out all the kinks for a while n then buy it on sale later on and by that time I should be ready to graduate from NMS haha. Although i just passed 100 hrs into this game and no signs of slowing down... would highly recommend!! this game is a blast thru intergalactic sci-fi and contains super nerd features like the ability to name your own planets as they become discovered in the NMS universe aka exacty the kind of space $#!+ I was looking for ;) Nice Job NMS **Also got it 1/2 off during a holiday promo add it if you see it tht low or more again",1699117777,1699117777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still unremarkable in every way.

Flying a ship feels the same as every other ship.  
They differ only in backpack size and what you place in the backpack. 
1 doesn't go any faster or accelerate quicker than they other. 
There are no advantages/disadvantages to choosing one over another.
You can modify each one to have the same amount of backpack slots. 
You can not crash into the surface, your ship is a bumper car, the entire universe is filled with asteroids. 
Space environs are stale and pastel-washed mediocrity in literal infinite repetition. 
Combat both on foot and space feels as strategic and simplistic as the Galaga classic and equally as unfulfilling/boring.

Player movement feel like your character is running in peanut-butter.
Ship movement feels more like a camera panning around in space.  
There is no sense of speed as every single ship goes the same speed. 

Base building is ok but implemented without any reasoning within the game-loop.  It's an after effect.  Why build a base?  Whats it do?  What happens?  Nothing.  Nothing happens.   It's a place to keep a teleporter for if you want to revisit a galaxy you left. 


The story...vague.
Actually all narrative around this game is tediously vague. 
AI or NPCs are little more than self-moving text prompts you must ask for word translations. 
There is no engagement in this game.  
You are simply an observer to what is a mud-puddle pretending to be the Sky.

----------------------------------
Still no good. Yes, this game has too much potential, but no. Down vote for this game still.
Reason:
Too many main quest bugs: Game breaking bugs spread over your main story line, and for me I ran into 2 of those bugs. One for cannot locate Artemis, the other is I cannot end The Purge Quest. There were countless small bugs but meh, not as critical as those 2. Those 2 bugs directly made me to abandon this game, because, it wont allow me to play it. I CANNOT PLAY IT.

Another reason is for the online discovery service and single player network bugs: WHY THE F I HAVE TO WAIT FOR HOURS FOR THE ONLINE DISCOVERY SERVICE TO GO CONNECTED SO I CAN UPLOAD MY DISCOVERIES? Many times, I tried to reach some solar sys as fast as I can so I can rename the system, some good ones near the center of a galaxy, but I reached over there and found my online discovery service is disconnected. FINE, I waited, for 3 hours, then FINALLY the service is green again, just to find the system has been claimed by other players. This is pure b u l l s h i t. Why use such a broken service while the original goal of this online discovery function is to give the chance of the first discoveries can be renamed as a reward for those who discovered it? why not just shut the function down? while some players maybe lucky enough to connect to the wooden server HG have for online discovery service, other players just cannot do anything about it, since when discovery is only the race of who got the best connection but not who reached there first? PIECE OF JOKE.

EDIT: today I tried with my friend, he can still upload and overwrite my discoveries even when I uploaded them while it says I was connected to the online discovery system. And he was connected to the bloody fking piece of joke service also.

Im just so disappointed about this, so disappointed. The original goal was to allow the first player reached the system to get the right to name the system or other discoveries by his will, this is AWESOME. And means a lot. And I LOVE IT.
But the bloody online discovery service server just ruined ALL what the game could be. 

And when I play with my friends I love the online play function, it IS GREAT, but, then I want to solo play I turned off the online function and STILL, OTHER RANDOM PLAYERS I DON'T KNOW KEEPS ENTERING MY GAME, AND CLAIM MY DISCOVERIES.

Last is that for other language support for non-English speakers, there is just simply none, crappy translate, and none English speakers CANNOT name their discoveries with their own language. Only English letters accepted. For real?
 
EVEN in game, your game encourage players to learn the 3 different race’s culture and language.

Hay multitud de elementos e items distintos (algunos por ejemplo para recargar herramientas o partes de la nave, como la herramienta de minado o el asistente de hipervelocidad). Hay muchas formas de conseguir estos materiales y no todos los planetas o asteroides tienen los mismos elementos.

Tambien puedes crear tu propia base e ir evolucionando el arbol de investigacion para tener nuevos elementos (como paneles solares, interruptores, portal de teletransporte...).

Have I been tricked into playing an MMO? 

No Man's Sky is a difficult game to review. I cannot remember a game that is both so good and so bad at the same time. It's a science fiction Minecraft with a difficulty level that hovers around a match 4 game, yet it has an outstanding, even moving, storyline. The developers have continued to support the game after many years, but much of the support to the game consists of throwing in new systems on top of old systems with little heed for their interaction. The list of brilliant ideas in the game - planet exploration, fleet actions, language acquisition - is also the list of things that are infuriating about the game due to their implementation.

The plot is sort of the exemplar of that. The main plot is also, somewhat, the tutorial, which is a sound way to do things, particularly for a game with a sandbox-focus, and doubly so because of plot reasons that get into spoiler territory. But as a tutorial, it's pretty ill-formed, doing the thing where it teaches you concepts that you had to already understand to get to the point where you're supposed to learn them. Most (not all) of the plot motion consists of no player agency other than pressing a 'continue plot' button, giving question to why you have to put it in the first place. It was great, not novel by any means but getting into some great both old and new sci-fi territory, but it was painful to get through.

The things that I think that the game brings to the table that are somewhat unique and well-executed are the way multi-player works, which, even at best, remains somewhat iffy because multi-player is inherently so, and the sort of shuffling around components for different effects, which is fun, but tends to be only a midgame thing, or at least with slot expansions becoming more common it becomes a much different sort of task. 

It's the kind of game where you can lose two hours of your life to a Skinner box that feels like it arises more out of a lack of QoL improvements to the game, only to then trip and fall into a sense of wonder when something wild happens, only for it to be erased by that same amazing thing repeating itself.
